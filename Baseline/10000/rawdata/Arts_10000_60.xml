'''Actors Theatre of Louisville''' is a non-profit [[performing arts]] [[theater]] located in [[Downtown Louisville|downtown]] [[Louisville, Kentucky]].

Actors Theatre was founded in 1964 following the merging of two local companies, Actors, Inc. and Theatre Louisville, operated by Louisville natives Ewel Cornett and Richard Block.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://actorstheatre.org/about/history/|title=Actors Theatre History - Actors Theatre of Louisville|work=Actors Theatre of Louisville|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designated as the "State Theater of Kentucky" in 1974, the theatre has been called{{by whom?|date=January 2018}} one of America's most consistently innovative professional theatre companies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arts.gov/article/actors-theatre-louisville-louisville-ky|title=Actor's Theatre of Louisville (Louisville, KY) {{!}} NEA|website=www.arts.gov|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an annual attendance of 150,000.

The theatre presents almost 400 performances annually, including classics and contemporary work through the [[Brown-Forman]] Series, holiday plays, a series of free theatrical events produced by the Professional Training Company, and the [[Humana Festival of New American Plays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://actorstheatre.org/humana-festival-of-new-american-plays/history/|title=The Humana Festival of New American Plays - Actors Theatre of Louisville|work=Actors Theatre of Louisville|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the theatre provides arts experiences to students across the region through its education department and supports a pre-professional resident training program, the Professional Training Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.courier-journal.com/story/entertainment/theater/2016/09/16/actors-theatre-intensifies-apprentice-program/90043288/|title=Actors Theatre beefs up training program|work=The Courier-Journal|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre has been the recipient of a Tony Award for Distinguished Achievement, the James N. Vaughan Memorial Award for Exceptional Achievement and Contribution to the Development of Professional Theatre, and the Margo Jones Award for the Encouragement of New Plays.{{cn|date=January 2018}} The theater has toured to 29 cities and 15 countries.{{cn|date=January 2018}} Currently, there are more than 50 published books of plays and criticism from the theater in circulation—including anthologies of Humana Festival plays, volumes of ten-minute plays and monologues, and essays, scripts and lectures from the Brown-Forman Classics in Context Festival. Numerous plays first produced at the theatre have also been published as individual acting editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://actorstheatre.org/about/history/|title=Actors Theatre History - Actors Theatre of Louisville|work=Actors Theatre of Louisville|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humana Festival of New American Plays==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
The Humana Festival has introduced nearly 450 plays into the American and international theatre's general repertoire, including three Pulitzer Prize winners—''The Gin Game'' by D. L. Coburn, ''Crimes of the Heart'' by Beth Henley and ''Dinner with Friends'' by Donald Margulies—as well as Marsha Norman's ''Getting Out'', John Pielmeier's ''Agnes of God'', Charles Mee's ''Big Love'', Naomi Iizuka's ''Polaroid Stories'' and ''At the Vanishing Point'', Jane Martin's ''Anton in Show Business'', Rinne Groff's ''The Ruby Sunrise'', Theresa Rebeck's ''The Scene'', Gina Gionfriddo's ''After Ashley'' and ''Becky Shaw'', UNIVERSES' ''Ameriville'', Rude Mechs' ''The Method Gun'', Jordan Harrison's ''Maple and Vine'', Will Eno's ''Gnit'', Branden Jacobs-Jenkins' ''Appropriate'', and Lucas Hnath's ''Death Tax'' and ''The Christians''.  More than 380 Humana Festival plays have been published in anthologies and individual acting editions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americantheatre.org/2017/11/15/actors-theatre-of-louisville-announces-2018-humana-festival/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Humana Festival draws theater lovers, journalists, and film and stage producers from around the world. About 36,000 patrons attend the five weeks of plays and associated events, which includes a dedicated weekend for college students, which annually attracts students from more than 40 colleges and universities. The Festival culminates in two Industry Weekends which bring together a collection of amazing new plays with one-of-a-kind panels, cocktail parties, discussions and networking events. &lt;ref&gt;https://actorstheatre.org/humana-festival-of-new-american-plays/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
In May 1969, [[Jon Jory]], the son of stage and screen star [[Victor Jory]] was appointed the theater's new producing director. During this three decades in Louisville he produced more than 1,300 plays, increased Actors Theatre's budget from $244,000 to $8.3 million.{{cn|date=January 2018}} His Louisville debut was in October 1969 with [[Dylan Thomas]]' ''[[Under Milk Wood]]''. Former Executive Director, Alexander Speer, whose tenure of forty years began in 1965, became Jory's partner and led the theater's administration and operations until his retirement in the spring of 2006.

Marc Masterson was appointed the company's new Artistic Director in 2000. He had previously served as producing director of [[City Theatre (Pittsburgh)|City Theatre]] in Pittsburgh. During his tenure at Actors Theatre, Masterson produced more than 200 plays and expanded and established an Education Department consisting of public outreach programs including classroom workshops, artists in the schools, increased weekday student matinées, backstage tours and professional development for teachers and community center leaders. Masterson left Actors Theatre in 2011 to become artistic director at [[South Coast Repertory]] in California.

Following a national search, Obie Award-winning director [[Les Waters]] was named artistic director on November 29, 2011, and assumed full-time duties at the theater in January 2012. A strong proponent of contemporary work and imaginative adaptations of classic materials, Waters is widely regarded{{by whom?|date=January 2018}} as one of the most influential directors working in America today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://stage-directions.com/news/31-changing-roles/3794-les-waters-new-artistic-director-at-actors-theatre-of-louisville.html|title=Les Waters New Artistic Director at Actors Theatre of Louisville - Stage Directions|last=Coakley|first=Jacob|date=2011-11-29|work=Stage Directions|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, Waters announced that the season would be his last. He left Louisville in summer 2018 to pursue his freelance directing career. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.americantheatre.org/2018/05/23/les-waterss-vision-of-life/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings==
The original home of Actors Theatre was an open loft—the former Egyptian Tea Room—above the Taylor Trunk Company on Fourth Street in downtown Louisville. In 1965, the theater relocated to the former site of the Illinois Central Railway Station on Seventh Street and River Road. The space was transformed by Architect Jasper Ward into a 350-seat theatre. In the fall of 1969, the city announced that the train station was to be demolished to make way for a connector highway.  In October 1972, the theater relocated to the newly renovated Old Bank of Louisville building on Main Street, where it remains to this day. The building that became Actors Theatre was a merging of two buildings: the 1837 [[James H. Dakin]]-designed [[Old Bank of Louisville]] (which is a [[National Historic Landmark]]) and the Myers-Thompson Display Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Putting Down Roots: The Actors Theatre of Louisville Builds a Stage to Call Home | url=http://www.nea.gov/about/40th/actors.html | publisher=National Endowment for the Arts | date=February 2, 2007 | accessdate=May 28, 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517071016/http://www.nea.gov/about/40th/actors.html | archivedate=May 17, 2008 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the theatre acquired a production studio at 9th and Magnolia Streets in the [[Old Louisville]] neighborhood.

'''Architectural design values''' make up an important part of what influences [[architect]]s and [[designer]]s when they make their design decisions. However, architects and designers are not always influenced by the same values and intentions. Value and intentions differ between different [[Architectural style|architectural movements]]. It also differs between different [[List of international architecture schools|schools of architecture]] and schools of design as well as among individual [[List of architects|architects]] and [[List of industrial designers|designers]].&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.{{cite web|url=http://www.aho.no/Global/Dokumenter/Forskning/Avhandlinger/Holm_Ideas_and_Beliefs.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724174839/http://www.aho.no/Global/Dokumenter/Forskning/Avhandlinger/Holm_Ideas_and_Beliefs.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences in values and intentions are directly linked to the [[Timeline of architecture|pluralism in design]] outcomes that exist within architecture and design. It is also a big contributing factor as to how an architect or designer operates in his/her relation to clients.

Different design values tend to have a considerable history and can be found in numerous design movements. The influence that each design value has had on design movements and individual designers has varied throughout history.

==Aesthetic design values==
The expansion of architectural and industrial design ideas and vocabularies which took place during the last century has created a diverse [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] reality within these two domains. This pluralistic and diverse aesthetic reality has typically been created within different architectural and industrial design movements such as: [[Modernism]], [[Postmodernism]], [[Deconstructivism]], [[Post-structuralism]], [[Neoclassicism]], New Expressionism, Supermodernism etc.&lt;ref&gt;KRIEGER, P. (2004) Contextualism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;STEER, L. M. (2004) Supermodernism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FLORES"&gt;FLORES, C. A. H. (2004) Symbolism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these aesthetic realities represent a number of divergent aesthetic values, in addition to differences in general values and theories found within these movements.&lt;ref name="FLORES" /&gt; Some of the stylistic distinctions found in these diverse aesthetic realities reflects profound differences in design values and thinking,&lt;ref name="FLORES" /&gt; but this is not the case for all stylistic distinctions, as some stylistic distinctions builds on similar thinking and values.

These aesthetic values and their diverse aesthetic expressions are to some degree a reflection of the development that has taken place in the art community. In addition, more general changes have taken place in Western societies, due to technological development, new economic realities, political changes etc. However, these diverse aesthetic expressions are also a reflection of individual architects and industrial designers’ personal expression, based on designers’ tendency to experiment with form, materials, and ornament to create new aesthetic styles and aesthetic vocabulary. Changes in aesthetic styles and expressions have been, and still are, both synchronic and diachronic, as different aesthetic styles are produced and promoted simultaneously.&lt;ref name="FLORES" /&gt;

A number of values which cannot be classified as aesthetic design values have influenced the development of the aesthetic reality, as well as contributed to the pluralistic aesthetic reality which characterises contemporary architecture and industrial design.

Aesthetic Design Values, contains seven values.

===Artistic aspects and self-expression===
It is characterised by a belief that individual self-expression—or one’s inner spiritual self and creative imagination, inner resources and intuition—should be utilised and/or be the base used when designing.&lt;ref name="Gelernter"&gt;Gelernter, M. (1995). Sources of architectural form: a critical history of Western design theory. Manchester, Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These sentiments are closely linked to a number of artistic values found in movements like [[Expressionism]] and the [[Avant-garde]] art.&lt;ref&gt;Fedders, K. (2004). Archigram. Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. R. S. Sennott. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn. 1: 57 - 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heynen, H. (2004). Avant-garde. Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. R. S. Sennott. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn. 1: 97 - 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this design value is closely related to abstract forms and expression, personal creative liberty, elitism and being ahead of the rest of society.

===The spirit of the time design value===
This design value is based on the conception that every age has a certain spirit or set of shared attitudes that should be utilised when designing. The [[Zeitgeist|Spirit of the Times]] denotes the intellectual and cultural climate of a particular era,&lt;ref&gt;Hume, D. (1965). Of the standard of taste: and other essays. Indianapolis, The Bobbs-Merrill Company.&lt;/ref&gt; which can be linked to an experience of a certain worldview, sense of taste, [[collective consciousness]] and unconsciousness.&lt;ref name="Gelernter" /&gt; Thus “form expression” which can be found, to some  extent in the “air” of a given time and each generation, should generate an aesthetic style that expresses the uniqueness related to that time.&lt;ref name="BROLIN"&gt;Brolin, B. C. (2000). Architectural ornament: banishment and return. New York, Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The structural, functional and material honesty design value===
Structural Honesty is linked to the notion that a structure shall display its “true” purpose and not be decorative etc.&lt;ref name="BROLIN" /&gt; Functional honesty is linked to the idea that a building or product form shall be shaped on the basis of its intended function, often known as “[[form follows function]]”. Material honesty implies that materials should be used and selected on the bases of their properties,&lt;ref&gt;KAUFMANN, E. (1955) Architecture in the age of reason; baroque and postbaroque in england, italy, and france, Cambridge, Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the characteristics of a material should influence the form it is used for.&lt;ref&gt;NESBITT, K. (1996) Theorizing a new agenda for architecture: an anthology of architectural theory 1965-1995, New York, Princeton Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a material must not be used as a substitute for another material as this subverts the materials “true” properties and it is “cheating” the spectator.&lt;ref&gt;WHITELEY, N. (1993) Design for society, London, Reaktion Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The simplicity and minimalism design value===
This design value is based on the idea that [[Minimalism|simple forms]], i.e. aesthetics without considerable ornaments, simple geometry, smooth surfaces etc., represents forms which are both truer to “real” art and represents “folk” wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;TOY, M. (1999) EDITORIAL. IN TOY, M. (Ed.) Aspects of minimal architecture II. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RUBY, I. &amp; RUBY, A. (2003) Essential, Meta-, Trans-. The Chimeras of Minimalist Architecture. IN RUBY, I. (Ed.) Minimal architecture. Munich, Prestel.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value implies that the more cultivated a person becomes, the more decoration disappears. In addition, it is linked to the notion that simple forms will free people from the everyday clutter, thus contribute to tranquillity and restfulness.&lt;ref&gt;SILVESTRIN, C. (1999) Royal Academy and AD International Forum, Something or Nothing: Minimalism in Art and Architecture 8. IN TOY, M. (Ed.) Aspects of minimal architecture II. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature and organic design value===
This design value is based on the idea that [[Natural building|nature]] (i.e. all sorts of living organisms, numerical laws etc.) can provide inspiration, functional clues and aesthetic forms that architects and industrial designers should use as a basis for designs.&lt;ref&gt;ALDERSEY-WILLIAMS, H. (2003) Zoomorphic : new animal architecture, London, Laurence King Publ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson"&gt;PEARSON, D. (2001) New organic architecture: the breaking wave, Berkeley, University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Designs based on this value tend to be characterized by free-flowing curves, asymmetrical lines and expressive forms. This design value can be summed up in “form follows flow” or “of the hill” as opposed to “on the hill”.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt;

===The classic, traditional and vernacular aesthetics design value===
This value is based on a belief that a building and product should be designed from timeless principles that transcend particular designers, cultures and climates.&lt;ref name="Gelernter" /&gt; Implicit in this design value is the notion that if these forms are used, the public will appreciate a structure’s timeless beauty and understand immediately how to use a given building or product.&lt;ref name="BEATLEY, T. 2004"&gt;BEATLEY, T. &amp; WHEELER, S. M. (2004) The sustainable urban development reader, London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value is also linked to [[Vernacular architecture|regional differences]] i.e. varying climate etc. and folklore cultures, which creates distinctive aesthetical expressions.&lt;ref name="GELERNTER, M. &amp; DUBRUCQ"&gt;GELERNTER, M. &amp; DUBRUCQ, V. (2004) Regionalism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The regionalism design value===
This design value is based on the belief that building—and to some degree products—should be designed in accordance with the particular characteristics of a specific place.&lt;ref name="GELERNTER, M. &amp; DUBRUCQ" /&gt; In addition, it is linked to the aim of achieving visual harmony between a building and its surroundings, as well as achieving continuity in a given area.&lt;ref&gt;ABEL, C. (1997) Architecture and identity: towards a global eco-culture, Oxford, Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it strives to create a connection between past and present forms of building. Finally, this value is also often related to preserving and creating regional and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;LEFAIVRE, L. &amp; TZONIS, A. (2003) Critical regionalism: architecture and identity in a globalized world, Munich, Prestel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social design values==
Many architects and industrial designers have a strong motivation to serve the public good and the needs of the user population.&lt;ref&gt;SYMES, M., ELEY, J. &amp; SEIDEL, A. D. (1995) Architects and their practices: a changing profession, Oxford, Butterworth Architecture.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, social awareness and social values within architecture and design reflect, to some degree, the emphasis these values are given in society at large.

It should be noted that social values can have an aesthetical impact, but these aspects will not be explored as the main aesthetical impact found in design has been covered in the previous sections. [[Social design]] values are at times in conflict with other design values. This type of conflict can manifest itself between different design movements, but it can also be the cause of conflicts within a given design movement. It can be argued that conflicts between social values and other design values often represent the continuing debate between Rationalism and Romanticism commonly found within architecture and industrial design.&lt;ref&gt;JOHNSON, D. L. (2004) Rationalism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Design Values category consisting of four design values.

===The social change design value===
This design value can be described as a commitment to change society for the better through architecture and industrial design.&lt;ref&gt;ZIPF, C. W. (2004) Arts and crafts movement. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HUGHES, R. (1991) The shock of the new art and the century of change, London, Thames and Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value is closely connected and associated with political movements and subsequent building programs.&lt;ref&gt;HATCH, C. R. (1984) The scope of social architecture, New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt; Architects and industrial designers that are committed to the design value of social change often see their work as a tool for transforming the built environment and those who live in it.&lt;ref name="SANOFF"&gt;SANOFF, H. (2000) Community participation methods in design and planning, New York, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The consultation and participation design value===
This design value is based on a belief that it is beneficial to involve [[Participatory design|stakeholders in the design process]].&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt; This value is connected to a belief that user involvement leads to:
#Meeting social needs and an effective use of resources.&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt;
#Influencing in the design process as well as awareness of the consequences etc.&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PREISER, W. F. E., WHITE, E. T. &amp; RABINOWITZ, H. Z. (1988) Post-occupancy evaluation, New York, Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Providing relevant and up-to-date information for designers.&lt;ref name="SANOFF" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ZIMRING, C. M. &amp; REIZENSTEIN, J. E. (1981) A Primer on [[post occupancy evaluation]]: uses and techniques of an increasingly valued tool. Architecture (AIA Journal), 70, 52 - 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The crime prevention design value===
This design value is based on the belief that the built environment can be manipulated to reduce crime levels,&lt;ref&gt;PRESS, M., COOPER, R. &amp; EROL, R. (2001) Design as a tool for social policy: the case of 'design against crime'. The Fourth European Academy of Design Conference. Aveiro Portugal.&lt;/ref&gt; which is attempted accomplished through three main strategies that are: 
#Defensible space.&lt;ref&gt;NEWMAN, O. (1972) Defensible space: crime prevention through urban design, New York, Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COLQUHOUN"&gt;COLQUHOUN, I. (2004) Design out crime: creating safe and sustainable communities, Amsterdam, Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Crime prevention through environmental design.&lt;ref name="COLQUHOUN" /&gt;
#Situational crime prevention.&lt;ref name="COLQUHOUN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WEKERLE, G. R. &amp; WHITZMAN, C. (1995) Safe cities: guidelines for planning, design, and management, New York ; London, Van Nostrand Reinhold.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 'Third world' design value===
This is based on an eagerness to help developing countries [[Architecture for Humanity|through architecture]] and design (i.e. a response to the needs of the poor and destitute within the [[Third World]]).&lt;ref&gt;SERAGELDIN, I. (1997) The architecture of empowerment a survey. IN SERAGELDIN, I. (Ed.) The Architecture of empowerment : people, shelter and livable cities. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;STRASSMANN, P. W. (1998) Third world housing. IN VAN VLIET, W. (Ed.) The Encyclopedia of housing. Thousand Oaks, Calif, Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value implies that social and economic circumstances found in the Third World necessitate the development of special solutions, which are distinct from what the same architects and industrial designers would recommend for the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;YUNUS, M. (1997) Foreword. IN SERAGELDIN, I. (Ed.) The Architecture of empowerment : people, shelter and livable cities. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ÖZKAN, S. (1997) Architecture to change the world? IN SERAGELDIN, I. (Ed.) The Architecture of empowerment : people, shelter and livable cities. London, Academy Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental design values==
The 20th century has been marked by the re-emergence of environmental values within Western societies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Concern for the environment is not new and can be found to a varying degree throughout history, and it is rooted in a number of perspectives including the aim of managing the ecosystems for sustained resource yields (sustainable development), and the idea that everything in nature has an intrinsic value (nature protection and preservation). Generally behind these types of thinking are the concepts of stewardship and that the present generation owes duties to generations not yet born.&lt;ref name="BEATLEY, T. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;THOMPSON, I. H. (2000) Aesthetic, social and ecological values in landscape architecture: a discourse analysis. Ethics, place and environment, 3, 269-287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental problems and challenges found in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a development where environmental values became important in some sections of Western societies. It is therefore not surprising{{According to whom|date=March 2012}} that these values can also be found among individual architects and industrial designers. The focus on [[environmental design]] has been marked with the rediscovery and further development of many “ancient” skills and techniques.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In addition, new technology that approaches environmental concerns is also an important characteristic of the environmental approach found among architects and industrial designers. These rather different approaches to environmental building and product technology can be illustrated with the development of environmental [[high-tech architecture]], and the more “traditional” environmental movement within is ecological based architecture.&lt;ref name="CUFF, D"&gt;CUFF, D. (2000) Epilogue. IN KOSTOF, S. (Ed.) ''The Architect : chapters in the history of the profession''. Berkeley, Calif., University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental technology, along with new environmental values, have affected development in cities across the world. Many cities have started to formulate and introduce "eco-regulations concerning renewable resources, energy consumption, sick buildings, smart buildings, recycled materials, and sustainability".&lt;ref name="CUFF, D" /&gt; This may not be surprising, as about 50% of all energy consumption in Europe and 60% in the US is building-related.&lt;ref name="CUFF, D" /&gt; However, environmental concerns are not restricted to energy consumption; environmental concerns take on a number of perspectives generally, which are reflected in the focus found among architects and industrial designers.

The environmental design values category consists of three design values.

===Green and sustainability===
This value is based on a belief that a [[Sustainable design|sustainable]] and/or environmentally friendly building approach is beneficial to users, society and future generations.&lt;ref&gt;MCDONALD, M. K. (2004) Sustainability and sustainable architecture. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) ''Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture''. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; Key concepts within this design value are: energy conservation, resource management, recycling, cradle-to-cradle, toxic free materials etc.&lt;ref name="BEATLEY, T. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MOSTAEDI, A. (2002) Sustainable architecture: low tech houses, Barcelona, Carles Broto i Comerma.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MOSTAEDI, A. (2003) Sustainable architecture: high tech housing, Barcelona, Carles Broto i Comerma.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WINES, J. &amp; JODIDIO, P. (2000) Green architecture, Köln, Taschen.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-use and modification===
This is based on a belief that existing buildings, and to some degree products, can be continuously used through updates.&lt;ref&gt;KALNER, S. (2004) Adaptwe re-use. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this value there are two separate schools of thought with regards to aesthetics: one camp focuses on new elements that are sublimated to an overall aesthetic, and the other advocates for aesthetical contrast, dichotomy and even dissonance between the old and the new.&lt;ref name="POWELL, K. 1999"&gt;POWELL, K. (1999) Architecture reborn: the conversion and reconstruction of old buildings, London, Laurence King.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
This design value is based on the belief that the built environment can contribute to ensuring a [[Sick building syndrome|healthy living environment]].&lt;ref name="FRANK"&gt;FRANK, L. D., ENGELKE, P. O. &amp; SCHMID, T. L. (2003) Health and community design: the impact of the built environment on physical activity, Washington, DC, Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BARTON, H., TSOUROU, C. &amp; WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. REGIONAL OFFICE FOR, E. (2000) Healthy urban planning: a WHO guide to planning for people, London, Published on behalf of the World Health Organization Regional.&lt;/ref&gt; Built into this design value, are principles like: buildings should be freestanding; sites need to be distributed to maximize the amount of sunlight that reaches individual structures.&lt;ref name="FRANK" /&gt; Similarly, there is an emphasis on health based construction and reduction of toxic emissions through selection of appropriate materials.&lt;ref&gt;BAKER-LAPORTE, P., ELLIOTT, E. &amp; BANTA, J. (2001) Prescriptions for a healthy house: a practical guide for architects, builders, and homeowners, Santa Fe, InWord Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional design values==
Within both architecture and industrial design there is a long tradition of being both inspired by and re-use design elements of existing buildings and products. This is the case even if many architects and industrial designers argue that they are primarily using their creativity to create new and novel design solutions. Some architects and industrial designers have openly led themselves be inspired by existing building and products traditions, and have even used this inspiration as the main base for their designs solutions.

This design tradition has a considerable history, which can be indicated in many of the labels associated with this tradition; this includes labels such as [[Classicism]], Vernacular, Restoration and Preservation etc. In addition, as indicated in the previous section “Classic, Traditional and Vernacular aesthetics”, an important element of this tradition is to re-use and be inspired by already existing aesthetical elements and styles. However, the traditional approach also implies other aspects such as functional aspects, preserving existing building traditions as well as individual buildings and products.

The Traditional Design Values category, consisting of three distinct values.

===The tradition based design value===
This relies on a belief that traditional “designs” are the preferred typology and template for buildings and products, because they “create” timeless and “functional” designs.&lt;ref&gt;AMUNDSON, J. A. &amp; MILLER, C. C. (2004) Classicism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this design value there are three main strategies:
#Critical traditionalist/regionalist i.e. interpreting the traditional typologies and templates and applying them in an abstracted modern vocabulary.&lt;ref name="TILMAN"&gt;TILMAN, J. T. (2004) Historicism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Revivalists i.e. adhering to the most literal traditional form.&lt;ref name="TILMAN" /&gt;
#Contextualists who use historical forms when the surroundings “demands” it.&lt;ref name="TILMAN" /&gt;

===The design value of restoration and preservation===
This is based on a commitment to preserve the best of buildings and products for future generations.&lt;ref name="POWELL, K. 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ROSS"&gt;ROSS, M. (1996) Planning and the heritage: policy and procedures, London, E &amp; FN Spon.&lt;/ref&gt; This design value tends to represent restoring a building or product to its initial design and is usually rooted in three perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;TOMLAN, M. A. (2004) Historic preservation. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; These are: 
#An archaeological perspective (i.e. preserving buildings and products of historical interest).&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;
#An artistic perspective i.e. a desire to preserve something of beauty.&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;
#A social perspective (i.e. a desire to hold on to the familiar and reassuring).&lt;ref name="ROSS" /&gt;

===The vernacular design value===
This value is based on a belief that a simple life and its design, closely linked to nature, are superior to that of modernity.&lt;ref&gt;OLIVER, P. (2004) Vernacular Architecture. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MORTON, P. (2004) Primitivism. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt; The design value of [[Vernacular architecture|Vernacular]] includes key concept such as: 
#Reinvigorating tradition (i.e. evoking the vernacular).
#Reinventing tradition i.e. the search for new paradigms.
#Extending tradition i.e. using the vernacular in a modified manner.
#Reinterpreting tradition i.e. the use of contemporary idioms.&lt;ref&gt;RUDOFSKY, B. (1964) Architecture without architects: a short introduction to non-pedigree architecture, New York, Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender-based design values==
This design values is closely linked to the feminist movement and theory developed within the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;WEISMAN, L. K. (1992) Discrimination by design: a feminist critique of the man-made environment, Urbana, University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WEISMAN"&gt;WEISMAN, L. K. (2000) Prologue: 'women's environmental rights: a manifesto'. IN BORDEN, I., RENDELL, J. &amp; PENNER, B. (Eds.) Gender space architecture: an interdisciplinary introduction. London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Design values based on gender are related to three tenets found in architecture and industrial design,&lt;ref&gt;ATTFIELD, J. (1989) Form/female follows function/male: Feminist critiques of design. IN WALKER, J. A. &amp; ATTFIELD, J. (Eds.) Design history and the history of design. London, Pluto.&lt;/ref&gt; which are: 
#Gender differences related to critique and reconstruction of architectural practice and history.&lt;ref name="MORTON"&gt;MORTON, P. (2004) Feminist Theory. IN SENNOTT, R. S. (Ed.) Encyclopedia of 20th-century architecture. New York, Fitzroy Dearborn.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The struggle for equal access to training, jobs and recognition in architecture and design.&lt;ref name="MORTON" /&gt;
#The focus on gender based theories for the built environment, the architectural discourse, and cultural value systems.&lt;ref name="MORTON" /&gt;

Designers that adhere to the Design values based on gender typically have a focus on creating buildings that do not have the same barriers that children, parents and the elderly experience in much of the built environment.&lt;ref name="WEISMAN" /&gt; It also implies a focus on aesthetics that are deemed to be more 'feminine' than the 'masculine' aesthetics often created by male designers.

==The economic design value==
Many architects and industrial designers often dread the financial and business side of architecture and industrial design practice, as their focus is often geared towards achieving successful design quality rather than achieving successful economic expectations.&lt;ref&gt;PYE, D. (1978) The nature and aesthetics of design, London, Barrie &amp; Jenkins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JACKSON, L. (Ed.) (1992) Strategic study of the profession: phase 1: strategic overview, London, Royal Institute of British Architects.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the basis for a design value that can be characterised as 'voluntarism' or 'charrette ethos'.&lt;ref&gt;BLAU, J. R. (1984) Architects and firms: a sociological perspective on architectural practice, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This value is commonly found among practising architects and designers. The 'volunteer' value is founded in the belief that good architecture and design requires commitment beyond the prearranged time, accountant’s budget, and normal hours.&lt;ref name="CUFF"&gt;CUFF, D. (1991) Architecture: the story of practice, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit in the 'volunteer' value are elements of the following claim present: 
#Best design works comes from offices or individual designers which are willing to put in overtime (sometimes unpaid) for the sake of the design outcome.&lt;ref name="CUFF" /&gt;
#Good architecture and design is rarely possible within fees offered by clients.&lt;ref name="CUFF" /&gt;
#Architects and designers should care enough about buildings or products to uphold high design standards regardless of the payment offered.&lt;ref name="CUFF" /&gt;

The 'volunteer' design value can be seen as a reaction to and a rejection of the client’s influence and control over the design project.

==The novel design value==
It is common within contemporary architecture and industrial design to find emphasis on creating novel design solutions. This emphasis is often accompanied by an equally common lack of emphasis on studying of the appropriateness of any already existing design solution.&lt;ref&gt;PORTER, D. (2000) Why do architects wear black? thinking beyond the trap. IN TOFT, A. E. (Ed.) Ethics in architecture : architectural education in the epoch of virtuality. [Leuven], European Association for Architectural Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel design value has historical roots dating back to early design movements such as [[Modernism]], with is emphasis on “starting from zero”.&lt;ref&gt;WOLFE, T. (1981) From bauhaus to our house, London, Picador.&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration of original and novel design solutions is, by many designers and design scholars, considered one of the main aspects of architecture and design. This design value is often manifested through the working methods of designers. Some architects and designers with their emphasis on the “big idea” will have a tendency to cling to major design ideas and themes, even if these themes and ideas are faced with insurmountable challenges.&lt;ref&gt;LAWSON, B. (1997) How designers think: the design process demystified, Oxford, Architectural Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ROWE, P. G. (1987) Design thinking, Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CROSS, N. (2004) Expertise in design: an overview. Design Studies, 25, 427 - 441.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the emphasis on design novelty is also associated with progress and new design solutions that, without this emphasis, would not see the light of day.

The design value of novelty is not generally accepted within either architecture or design. This is indicated by the debate in architecture, focusing on whether buildings should harmonize with the surroundings in that they are situated in or not.&lt;ref&gt;COLLINS, P. (1971) Architectural judgement, London, Faber &amp; Faber.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally is the debate where architecture should be based on traditional topology and design styles i.e. classical and vernacular base architecture or if it should be an expression of its time. The same issues are indicated within the industrial design domain where it has been debated if retro design should be accepted or not as good design.

==Mathematical and scientific design values==
A movement to base architectural design on scientific and mathematical understanding started with the early work of [[Christopher Alexander]] in the 1960s, ''[[Notes on the synthesis of form]]''. Other contributors joined in, especially in investigations of form on the urban scale, which resulted in important developments such as Bill Hillier's [[Space syntax]] and Michael Batty's work on [[Spatial analysis]]. In architecture, the four-volume work [[The Nature of Order]] by Alexander summarizes his most recent results. An alternative architectural theory based on scientific laws, as for example [[A Theory of Architecture]]  is now competing with purely aesthetic theories most common in architectural academia.  This entire body of work can be seen as balancing and often questioning design movements that rely primarily upon aesthetics and novelty. At the same time, the scientific results that determine this approach in fact verify traditional and vernacular traditions in a way that purely historical appreciation cannot.

Social and environmental issues are given a new explanation, drawing upon biological phenomena and the interactivity of groups and individuals with their built environment. The new discipline of [[biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]] developed by [[E. O. Wilson]] plays a major role in explaining the human need for intimate contact with natural forms and living beings. This insight into the connection between human beings and the biological environment provides a new understanding for the need for ecological design. An extension of the biophilic phenomenon into artificial environments suggests a corresponding need for built structures that embody the same precepts as biological structures. These mathematical qualities include fractal forms, scaling, multiple symmetries, etc.. Applications and extensions of Wilson's original idea are now carried out by Stephen R. Kellert in the [[Biophilia hypothesis]], and in by [[Nikos Salingaros]] and others in the book "Biophilic Design".

The '''[[architecture]] of [[Bermuda]]''' has developed over the past four centuries.  The archipelago's isolation, environment, climate, and scarce resources have been key driving points, though inspiration from Europe, the Caribbean and the Americas is evident.  Distinctive elements appeared with initial settlement in the early 17th century, and by the second half of that century features that remain common today began to appear.

Pastel Bermuda [[cottage]]s are often regarded as a hallmark of the island, along with pink beaches and [[Bermuda shorts]]; the style has even been described as the country's only indigenous art form.&lt;ref name=StGeorgesHeritageSite&gt;[http://www.gov.bm/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_3213_0_0_43/http;/ptpublisher.gov.bm;7087/publishedcontent/publish/ministry_of_environment/planning/dept___planning___world_heritage_site/articles/world_heritage_site_newsletter_4.pdf The Town of St. George World Heritage Site: Advice for renovating, restoring, maintaining or developing a building within the Town of St. George]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608075016/http://www.gov.bm/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_3213_0_0_43/http%3B/ptpublisher.gov.bm%3B7087/publishedcontent/publish/ministry_of_environment/planning/dept___planning___world_heritage_site/articles/world_heritage_site_newsletter_4.pdf |date=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the local style, historical military buildings and forts and [[modern architecture|modern office buildings]] are highly visible.  The historical architecture of Bermuda has received recognition from [[UNESCO]], with the [[St. George's, Bermuda|Town of St. George]] and some twenty-two forts and military facilities in [[St. George's Parish, Bermuda|St. George's Parish]] being declared [[World Heritage Sites]].

==Bermuda style==
[[File:Bermuda roof.jpg|left|thumb|A typical residence, emphasis on the stepped [[Bermudian roof]], used for [[rainwater collection]]]]
The archetypical Bermuda house is a low, squared building with a stepped, white roof and pastel-painted walls, both of which are made out of stone.  Between roof and wall are a series of eaves painted a third colour, which is also used on the wooden shutters of relatively small windows.  Often built on a slope, there is a set of stairs, wider at the base than at the top, leading up to a porch or verandah around the front door.  Rare embellishments include a brick pattern down the corners of the building, and narrow moulding to highlight features such as windows.

The roofs are designed to catch water, of which there is no fresh supply in Bermuda apart from rain.  The walls are designed to restrict damage from hurricanes and are required by law to be able to withstand windspeeds of over {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.  Houses are often given names.

&lt;!--

This is from the [[Bermudian architecture]] article which I have now set as a redir to here. Some can be merged if it is reffed.

[[Bermuda]] has developed its own unique [[architecture]], which helps it overcome two of its greatest adversities: [[hurricanes]] and the islands' complete lack of natural fresh water supplies.

Traditional Bermudian structures are notable for their thick stone walls - now required by law to be able to resist winds of at least 117 mph. These walls are typically painted a solid [[pastel]] colour, making the buildings bright and welcoming.

The roofs are exclusively white, their stepped slopes having been made out of [[limestone]], and then white-washed. This limestone removes impurities from rain water, which is then funnelled into underground water tanks that supply the household water. As such, there is little in the way of government-supplied water. To overcome small tank sizes, many Bermudians dig wells to supply their toilets - the water that is produced from these wells is now too contaminated with salt for any other purpose.

Other notable traits of traditional Bermudian houses include prominent eaves and green-painted wooden shutters on every window (closed to protect the glass from flying objects during hurricanes). Since the local limestone is very soft, Bermudian houses have historically eschewed complex decorations, leading to a very severe and restrained style.

Beyond the housing, a traditional object of Bermudian architecture is the [[moon gate]], a symbolic stone ring that looks like a door-less doorway in walls.

==History and development==

===Initial development: 1600-1700===

[[File:State House of Bermuda (1614).png|thumb|right|200px|The [[State House, Bermuda]], built in 1620, was one of the first stone structures.]]

The predominance of stone as a building material came about early in Bermuda's history.  The first settlers built using the native and abundant [[Bermuda cedar]], but such structures were rarely able to withstand either the normal winds or the occasional [[hurricane]].&lt;ref name=Raine11&gt;Raine, David F.  ''Architecture Bermuda Style'' (Bermuda: Pompano 1988), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the [[Somers Isles Company]] intended to exploit the value of cedar wood, particularly for shipbuilding, and soon passed laws that forbade the felling and use of that wood without express permission.  The only material left for settlers to use was Bermuda's [[limestone]] foundation (often called "[[coral]]" for its origin), with the stone being cut into square bricks – typically about {{convert|2|ft|mm}} by {{convert|10|in|mm}}.&lt;ref name=Some&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1883/02/25/archives/some-bermuda-houses-how-they-are-built-and-what-they-cost.html|title=Some Bermuda Houses|last=D|first=W|date=1883-03-30|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This method of using large stone blocks proved expensive, with one 1890 estimate being that a Bermuda house cost three times more than it should.  The main cause of this expense was high labour costs, though the rarity of building-quality limestone also contributed.  However, this did not prove expensive enough to price the poor – particularly blacks – out of the market, thus restricting the growth of [[shanty towns]].&lt;ref name=DrysdaleStoneHouses&gt;Drysdale, William.  [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/03/30/103236452.pdf "Bermuda's stone houses; how the soft rock is cut and hardened"], ''New York Times", March 30, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

The archetypical house of the late 17th century had several distinguishing features.  The building was usually quite simple in design, with a similar plan to a contemporary English farmhouse.  Though usually only one storey tall, most were built facing out from slopes (possibly to preserve the comparatively fertile valleys for agriculture, a dominant industry until the 20th century&lt;ref name=Soil&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1890/03/23/archives/the-rich-bermuda-soil-only-two-thousand-acres-of-tillable-land.html|title=The Rich Bermuda Soil|last=Drysdale|first=William|date=1890-03-23|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;), thus necessitating a set of steps to the front entrance.  These staircases were styled to curve out, so ending up far wider at the base than at the top.  This flared style, known locally today as "Welcoming Arm" stairs, remains common.&lt;ref name=Raine23&gt;Raine, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  Less common variants used parallel arms, and in the narrow streets of the Town of St. George staircases were often flush with the wall.&lt;ref name=Jarvis91&gt;Jarvis, Michael, ''Bermuda Architectural Heritage Series: St. George's'' ([[Bermuda National Trust]]: 1998), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  At the top of the stairs would be a porch-like [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]], larger than was common elsewhere, where visitors and passersby could rest in the shade.  These porch areas were continuously expanded with furniture and [[muslin]] [[mosquito nets]].&lt;ref name=Raine21&gt;Raine, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  Wooden [[window shutters]] became common, particularly "jalousies" — which were hinged at the top — that were probably imported from the [[West Indies]].  Food was often stored in a buttery separate from the main house, which was designed to keep food cool.  This was achieved by keeping the actual storage room raised above the ground, typically five or six steps worth of height, and using a pointed roof, enabling [[convective heat transfer]] to keep warm air from the food.  Kitchens were also distinctive, occasionally placed in out-buildings or in basements and noted for the use of wide, raised chimneys possibly inspired by the open [[hearth]].&lt;ref name=Raine22&gt;Raine, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Town of St. George's and Warwick Fort in Bermuda (1614).png|thumb|left|[[St. George's, Bermuda]], the initial settlement, as it appeared in 1624.]]

The earliest roofing was made of [[Sabal bermudana|palmetto]] thatch but, partially from encouragement from the colonial government,&lt;ref name=Raine14&gt;Raine, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; stone shingles slowly came to be preferred.  By 1687, only 29 of the 579 houses in Bermuda had been upgraded to stone and only 63 were shingled.&lt;ref name=Raine23 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smiths1&gt;Chudleigh, Diana. ''Bermuda Architectural Heritage Series: Smith's Parish'' ([[Bermuda National Trust]]: 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The buildings were originally quite plain, due to the brittleness of limestone and lingering [[Puritanical]] [[asceticism]].  Only two means of decor have been observed in 17th century buildings: "Eyebrow Windows" and [[gable|gable-ends]].  The former may have been inspired by the [[Gothic architecture]] of churches.&lt;ref name=Raine24&gt;Raine, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  By the start of the 18th century, the latter, inspired by contemporary [[Stuart architecture]] and demonstrating resistance to hurricane damage when buttressed by a chimney,&lt;ref name=Trimingham35&gt;Trimingham, Michael. ''Bermuda Architectural Heritage Series: St. George's'' ([[Bermuda National Trust]]: 1998) p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; had splintered into three distinct styles: stepped, bowed and scalloped, with evident similarities to Spanish and Portuguese colonial architecture.&lt;ref name=Raine24 /&gt;

Owing to the lack of water sources on the island, roofs were and are still used for [[rainwater collection]]. Early water tanks were placed not underground, but in adjacent stone structures later likened by one American observer to a [[lean-to]].  These tanks were fed via a stone gutter from the roof.&lt;ref name=Some /&gt;  Sunk six to eight feet down, they were typically rectangular and appeared barrel-vaulted above the surface.&lt;ref name=Raine23 /&gt; A distinctive style of {{visible anchor|Bermudian roof}} developed, with a stepped profile of limestone slabs, [[grouted roof|grouted]] to make it impermeable and to stay clean. Rain on such a roof is slowed by the steps, rather than sloping tiles, and is collected by the gutter. This dependence on harvester rain led to a culture of water conservation, even with today's [[desalination plant]]s.&lt;ref name="BBC, Bermudian roof" &gt;{{Cite web

Interior wooden elements such as the ceiling and floors would be made of wood, often [[pine]] or [[tsuga|hemlock]] from the [[North America|continent]].

===Middle period: 1700-1900===
[[File:Bermuda-Stewart Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Stewart Hall in St. George's was built around 1707.]]
[[File:"Spithead" - 18th Century Bermudian home of Hezekiah Frith and 20th Century home of Eugene O'Neill.jpg|thumb|right|"Spithead", the 18th Century Bermudian home of [[Hezekiah Frith]] and 20th Century  home of [[Eugene O'Neill]] and [[Oona O'Neill]].]]
Into the 18th century, the settlement in Bermuda, and thus the architecture of Bermuda, had been developing for a century.  In 1712 and 1714, two particularly bad hurricane strikes showcased the need for the resilient local structures in lieu of European designs, thus ensuring that local architecture would continue to progress.&lt;ref name=CampbellinButler&gt;Campbell, Colin. "Wooden Houses", Dale Butler, JP MP, ''The Wooden Houses of Bermuda'' (Atlantic Publishing: Florida 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Georgian architecture]], at least in the British sense, did not catch on in Bermuda,&lt;ref name=Raine39&gt;Raine, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; though the contemporary local style did resemble the [[Georgian architecture#Colonial Georgian architecture|"colonial Georgian"]] of North America.&lt;ref name=TOHFamilyPlan2&gt;Bandon, Alexandra and Amy Hughes.  [http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/article/0,,634338-2,00.html "The Family Plan: The Georgian Style"], ''This Old House'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 18th century embellishing buildings with decoration and adopting elements from [[Chinese architecture|Chinese]] and [[Neo-Classical architecture]] became common.  [[Finials]],  a [[chinoiserie]] fad in both Europe and North America, appeared on gable-ends and buttery pinnacles.&lt;ref name=Raine39 /&gt;  While the original, ten-to-fifty inch Chinese finials were elaborate designs of [[porcelain]] glazed yellow, green, red, blue, orange and buff, those in Bermuda, made of brittle local limestone, remained stone-coloured and rarely exceeded fifteen inches (381&amp;nbsp;mm) .  Another Chinese architectural import was the now-iconic [[Moon gate|Moongate]].  Again, the Bermudian version was made of limestone and, unlike the Asian originals, not sunken into walls.

Stone pillars came into vogue, adorning driveway entrances.  Square, instead of the cylindrical of their Neo-Classical inspiration, these pillars were crowned with [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of heterodox stone slabs stacked on top of each other to give a geometric pattern.  While [[eaves]] in the West Indies tended to be made large enough to provide shade, those in Bermuda were kept shallow — less than a foot — to reduce damage from [[hurricane]] wind, which could push against larger eaves and lift the roof off.  [[Jack-rafters]], also known as rafter-feet, were toyed with as decoration.&lt;ref name=Raine40&gt;Raine, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;  They were left exposed, similar to [[corbel]]s, and painted a colour that contrasted with the roof and walls.&lt;ref name=Raine41&gt;Raine, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Internally, well-steeped [[tray ceilings]] replaced the open-beamed [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor style]].  Above this, the roofs changed considerably.  The [[hip roof]], shallower than its predecessors, was adopted,&lt;ref name=Jarvis72&gt;Jarvis, ''St. George's'', p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; and roofing slates of thin, handcut limestone slabs replaced shingles.  These slates were slightly over an inch thick, and ten to twelve inches (305&amp;nbsp;mm)  long; laid over a cedar frame in an overlapping pattern, they gave a down-stepped appearance.  Finally, the roofs were coated with a mixture of lime, sand and water and, when available, turtle and [[whale oil]] to provide extra weather-proofing.  Apart from the animal oil, this method of roof construction continues to be used.  The walls, likewise, were often [[whitewash]]ed, giving the island a faux snowcover if seen from a distance, though American author [[Mark Twain]] preferred to liken it to [[cake]] [[Icing (food)|icing]], "the white of marble...modest and retiring [in comparison]".&lt;ref name=Highlights&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/frommers/travel/guides/caribbean-and-bermuda/bermuda/frm_bermuda_0091021208.html|title=Architectural Highlights|work=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 20, 2006 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  French botanist [[André Michaux]], on the other hand, found the reflective glare of the roofs fatiguing.&lt;ref name=Shorto36&gt;Shorto, Sylvia.  ''Bermuda Gardens &amp; Houses'' (Rizzoli: New York 1996), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  A common alternative to the whitewash was a simple [[lime plaster]] made — much like the wash — of lime, red clay and turtle or whale oil.  If well-maintained, this plaster kept walls free of moisture, but if cracked, moisture would be retained.&lt;ref name=Trimingham25&gt;Trimingham, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

As the water available for domestic use was obtained via the roof, the only way to expand the amount available was to expand the house laterally.  Rooms were added to the existing block, first giving buildings a [[cruciform]] appearance and later leaving no standard floor plan for the archetypical house.&lt;ref name=Raine41 /&gt;  By 1711, propertied Bermudians often lived in houses of three to six rooms, the central of which was called the "hall"; this  "hall" served as the principle sitting and formal dining room.  Porches were often closed in with stone walls and window rather than being open-air.&lt;ref name=Smiths1 /&gt;  Common rooms included the "parlour", a bedroom, two or three "bedchambers", an "entry" distinct from the porch and a peripheral "outlet" room often at the back of the house.&lt;ref name=Smiths2&gt;Chudleigh, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Archways came to be featured heavily in doorways.  Porches, backdoors and even basements featured simple arches, rarely decorated with capitals or [[voussoir]]-style keystones, that show inspiration from both Colonial Mexico and Saxon-Roman styles.  These arches continued outward, appearing as garden gateways.&lt;ref name=Raine42&gt;Raine, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th century saw the use of the [[casement window]] adjoined to the [[wall plate]] between the wall and rafters.  In time, the casement would be replaced by the [[sash window]], and improved building techniques allowed window- and door-frames to be removed from the wallplate.&lt;ref name=Trimingham3&gt;Trimingham, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-classical styles, then in vogue in both Britain and America, appeared, particularly among the wealthy.  [[Portico]]s with simple limestone [[Doric order]] pillars topped by comparatively elaborate capitals were built, and upstairs windows were made smaller to recreate Classical optical perspective.  The corners of buildings were also adorned with mock columns, and gateways were made more ornate.&lt;ref name=Raine43&gt;Raine, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;  To further accent building geometry, narrow strips of moulding were used to highlight features such as storeys and windows.&lt;ref name=Raine44&gt;Raine, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Garden walls replaced fences that had been erected to keep out animals.  These walls were initially low and augmented by fairly tall stone posts, between which [[picket fence|picket fencing]] was installed.  Victorian notions of privacy, however, would see many of these hybrid fences replaced by tall, solid stone walls, particularly in the east.&lt;ref name=White71&gt;White, David.  ''Bermuda's Architectural Heritage Series: Sandys'' (Bermuda National Trust: 1999), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  Substantial — often pretentious — gateposts and wooden gates were standard elements.&lt;ref name=Jarvis27&gt;Jarvis, ''St. George's'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Towards the end of the 18th century, [[verandah]]s replaced the built-up porches at the top of the front staircase.  First appearing in buildings designed by the British military, the verandahs originated in India and were popular in the West Indies.  Initially most used either a plain square [[baluster]] or a "[[Thomas Chippendale|Chinese Chippendale]]" style, increasingly elaborate forms took precedence during the [[Victorian era]].&lt;ref name=Trimingham68&gt;Trimingham, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bda custom house.JPG|thumb|left|The Bermuda Customs House in Hamilton features white [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]] on a pink wall.]]

During the 19th century, the earlier design features were refined and softened.  Gable-ends (now strengthened by concrete and making a fashionable comeback),&lt;ref name=Trimingham35 /&gt; pillars and gateways were rounded while capitals became standard for porch pillars.  The mock columns on the corners of buildings were replaced with [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]], also called "quoinces" and "longs and shorts", that alternated between being [[Brickwork|Headers or Stretchers]].  This style seems to have its origins in [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon England]].&lt;ref name=Raine58&gt;Raine, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Porches had been in decline since the second half of the 18th century, and by the early 19th century the inner [[entryway]] was also disappearing in favour of a direct entrance to the central hall.&lt;ref name=Smiths5&gt;Chudleigh, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1880s, Bermuda followed Britain in adopting the use of imported, clay-baked tiles for building decoration.  Few examples of this, however, have survived.&lt;ref name=Raine59&gt;Raine, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  Another British import was the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] in Bermuda's Anglican community.

===Modern developments:1900-===

[[File:Front Street Hamilton Bermuda.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Hamilton, Bermuda|The city of Hamilton]] has a mixture of both traditional and modern styles.]]
During the 20th century, expanded contact with the outside world has led to a considerable diversification of Bermuda's architecture, more so with commercial developments than residential, to the detriment of traditional styles.  Concern for the loss of Bermudian identity led to the 1937 creation of the [[Bermuda Historical Monuments Trust]], predecessor to the present-day [[Bermuda National Trust]], to purchase and preserve important examples of indigenous architecture.&lt;ref name=Smiths12&gt;Chudleigh, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, though, earlier styles made a resurgence, as did the Colonial Spanish arch.&lt;ref name=Raine77&gt;Raine, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Edwardian period]] saw the introduction of hybrid British-American [[bungalows]] marketed to the middle class; features included exposed eaves, windows gathered together and low roofs that were extended to cover porches.&lt;ref name=Smiths10&gt;Chudleigh, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The early century also saw the perhaps counterintuitive growth of wooden buildings.  Often these buildings were to provide cheap housing for imported labour, such as from the West Indies in the 1900s and 1930s, or during the Second World War for the builders of [[Kindley Air Force Base]].  Such designs were usually looked down up: the wooden neighbourhood on King's Point was described as a shanty town.  Wooden buildings became most prolific in Sandys parish, near to the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]], followed by St. George's near the Kindley Field (used to house not only labourers but displaced residents) and finally Pembroke.&lt;ref name=Butleriv&gt;Butler, Dale. ''The Wooden Houses of Bermuda'', p. iv&lt;/ref&gt;  In the subsequent decades, many of these wooden buildings would be demolished.&lt;ref name=Butlerv&gt;Butler, p. v&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-fabricated buildings, often imported from the United States appeared early.  Typically, they have been used as temporary, low-cost residences.  Prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, Cox Outerbridge imported wooden pre-fabricated buildings and created an affordable community on his estate in [[Pembroke Parish, Bermuda|Pembroke]].&lt;ref name=CampbellinButler /&gt;  As recently as 2005, the government of Bermuda has imported pre-fabricated buildings in a somewhat controversial attempt to address the country's housing crisis.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Roberts, Stuart.

[[File:City Hall in Hamilton, Bermuda.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Completed in 1960 the (second) City Hall of Hamilton was inspired by traditional cottage design, though its central tower demonstrates a Scandinavian influence.&lt;ref name=HistoryofHamilton&gt;[http://www.cityhall.bm/Gallery/82_File_5.pdf History of Hamilton] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706150359/http://www.cityhall.bm/Gallery/82_File_5.pdf |date=July 6, 2011 }} (Corporation of Hamilton: 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1933, a large sum of money was [[bequest|bequeathed]] to the city of Hamilton for the construction of a new city hall.  The new structure, begun in the late 1950s and finished in 1960, was designed by Bermudian architect [[Wil Onions]] to copy styles from the traditional Bermuda cottage.&lt;ref name=CityHall&gt;[http://www.cityhall.bm/about/cityhall.asp City Hall] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515113718/http://www.cityhall.bm/about/cityhall.asp |date=May 15, 2009 }}, The Corporation of Hamilton&lt;/ref&gt;  Onions been demonstrating his skills at marrying modern needs with traditional decor for many years,&lt;ref name=Jarvis153&gt;Jarvis, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; and his work inspired a revitalised interest in traditional architecture.&lt;ref name=White97&gt;White, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern civil architecture appeared in Bermuda in the 1960s, though it has been mostly limited to the city of Hamilton and its immediate outskirts.  Generally used for private commercial purposes, the overseas styles began to take over the Hamilton skyline as international business grew, restricted only by a government mandate that no building be taller than the city's Cathedral.&lt;ref name=Shorto29&gt;Shorto, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Town of St. George and the east-end fortifications were nominated for inclusion on [[UNESCO|UNESCO's]] list of [[World Heritage Sites]], under the grounds of architecture that illustrates human history (criterion iv) and direct association with events and traditions (criterion vi).  During the selection process, the delegate from [[Mexico]] questioned why the site was not part of a serial nomination of Caribbean fortifications (considered by the [[United Nations]] to be part of a different region, [[Latin America]], from Bermuda, [[Northern America]], per the [[United Nations geoscheme]])&lt;ref name=UNregions&gt;[https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/maplib/worldregions.htm World Macro Regions and Components], [[United Nations]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the delegate from [[Thailand]] questioned why [[ICOMOS]] wanted to apply criterion vi; it was decided to inscribe the site on the World Heritage List under criterion iv only.&lt;ref name=UNList&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom00.htm#983 ''Report of the 24th session, 27 November - 2 December 2000''], [[UNESCO]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the renovation of "Harbour View" in St. George's was followed by the American home improvement franchise ''[[This Old House]]''.  The coverage was featured in four issues of the ''This Old House'' magazine and eight episodes of its television series, ''Ask This Old House''.

==Military construction==
{{see also|Military of Bermuda}}

[[File:John Smith 1624 map of Bermuda with Forts 01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Captain [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith's]] 1624 map of [[Bermuda]], showing the extent of fortification only a decade after colonisation.]]

Local and [[United Kingdom|British]] needs for military development long drove Bermuda's construction industry.  During the [[Early modern period|age of colonisation]], risk of attack by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[Early Modern France|French]] and [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] led to a ring of wooden fortifications being built along the coastline.  The first forts, Paget Fort and Smith's Fort, were built in 1612 − the first year of colonisation – to protect St. George's Harbour.  These first forts were built simply, starting out as platforms cut into stone where cannons were then placed.  They were then haphazardly expanded to the point where they could not withstand the elements and collapsed.&lt;ref name=Jarvis13&gt;Jarvis, ''St. George's'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fortification was slowly expanded to guard the entrance of [[Castle Harbour, Bermuda|Castle Harbour]], in time to fend of a Spanish expedition in 1614.  King's Castle was raised that same year, but subsequent attempts to improve the fort were unsuccessful; six years later, Southampton Fort and the Devonshire [[Redoubt]] were added to [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|Castle Harbour's defence]].&lt;ref name=Jarvis14&gt;Jarvis, ''St. George's'', p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 18th century few wooden forts — indeed, few of the original structures — remained.  The ring alternated between high towers and squat, hexagonal or square forts.  The eastern part of the archipelago was particularly well-fortified.&lt;ref name=Raine24&gt;Raine, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  King's Castle continued to be expanded, with an underground magazine and an outhouse cut of the stone that strongly resembles a local buttery.&lt;ref name=Jarvis15&gt;Jarvis, ''St. George's'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  A total of twenty forts — nearly one for each of Bermuda's square miles — would be erected by 1800, most of them to guard St. Georges.  By 1783, over half of the colony's cannons ringed the eastern parish.  These forts did not follow the conventional [[bastion]]-style that then prevailed in Europe; instead they most resembled the fortifications built under [[Henry VIII]] along the coast of [[southern England]] in the early 16th century.&lt;ref name=Jarvis16&gt;Jarvis, ''St. George's'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Storehouse HMD Bermuda.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The buildings at the Dockyard had little in common with local structures.]]

During and following the [[American War for Independence]], the British began to use the island as a major naval outpost.  The most notable construction of this period was the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard]].  The site surveyed in 1796, construction began in 1812 without regard to the local architectural developments.  Instead, it was built with conventional methods using brick and slate imported from [[Great Britain]] and [[Canada]].  Construction of the Dockyard continued until the 1860s and relied heavily on [[penal labour]], using prisoners from Britain housed in [[hulk (ship)|floating hulks]].  Construction resumed at the end of the 19th century and was done by imported West Indian workers.  One of the most prominent buildings of the Dockyard was the Commissioner's House, designed by the Royal Navy's chief architect [[Edward Holl]].  At {{convert|30000|sqft|m2}},&lt;ref name=BMMRental&gt;[http://www.bmm.bm/facility_rentals.htm Facility Rentals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025005723/http://www.bmm.bm/facility_rentals.htm |date=2008-10-25 }}, [[Bermuda Maritime Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; the verandah-wrapped building was far larger and grander than either the Government House, residence of Bermuda's Governor, or the Admiralty House used by the head of the [[North America and West Indies Station|North American Station]].&lt;ref name=White108&gt;White, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;  The Commissioner's House introduced the use of [[cast iron architecture|cast iron in buildings]] and was built largely using [[prison labour]].&lt;ref name=White109&gt;White, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Internally, the building featured [[John Soane|Soane styling]], [[flush toilet|flushing toilets]] and [[water heating|hot water]].  By the time the building was finished in 1832, the final cost was nearly £50,000 ($250,000); the [[Navy Board]] was outraged, and the building came to be regarded as a [[white elephant]].&lt;ref name=White110&gt;White, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was subsequently used as barracks by the [[British Army]] and the [[Royal Marines]] until its commissioning by the [[Royal Navy]] as [[HMS Malabar]] during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=White111&gt;White, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BermudaDockyard.jpg|thumb|left|The Commissioner's House and the walls of the Keep at the Dockyard.]]

Other military construction also followed the traditional British patterns, and had negligible effect on local architecture.  Through the 19th century, the British military continued to construct and expand fortifications and lay roads and bridges, most notably [[The Causeway, Bermuda|the causeway]] connecting [[Long Bird Island]] and [[St. David's Island, Bermuda|St. David's Island]] to the main island.&lt;ref name=Raine57&gt;Raine, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;  St. George's was also re-fortified by the [[Royal Engineers]].  New or replacement forts included Upper Paget Fort/Fort Cunningham, built above the remains of the first Paget Fort, Fort Victoria and Fort Albert to the east and [[Fort St. Catherine]], on the northern tip of St. George's.&lt;ref name=Jarvis120&gt;Jarvis, ''St. George's'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  St. George's also saw the construction of Fort George and Fort William as well as seaward [[artillery batteries]] at Buildings Bay and on St. David's Island.&lt;ref name=Jarvis121&gt;Jarvis, ''St. George's'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1820s, Bermuda's only [[Martello tower]] was built to cover [[Ferry Reach]].&lt;ref name=Jarvis128&gt;Jarvis, ''St. George's'', p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]], concerns over a landward attack on the Royal Naval Dockyard led to large tracts of the central parish of Devonshire being [[compulsory purchase|acquired]] by the British military.&lt;ref name=Trimingham10&gt;Trimingham, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Fort Prospect and Fort Langton, both built to an out-dated design, and the Military Hospital were constructed in the area, and local houses were used as officers' residences.&lt;ref name=Trimingham11&gt;Trimingham, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the British military buildings were fortifications, of course.  Barracks, hospitals and officer houses were built to British military standard, which fared poorly in Bermuda.  Verandahs were often supported by iron columns that required constant painting, while roofs were lined with [[Welsh slate]] that was lost after every hurricane.  Though a few pretentious copycats still appeared among Bermuda's residences, around the start of the 20th century even the military was abandoning the style in favour of local techniques.&lt;ref name=Jarvis133&gt;Jarvis, ''St. George's'', p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the largest and perhaps most traumatic military developments was the construction of [[Kindley Air Force Base]] by the [[United States]].  Seizing large areas of the eastern islands, many traditional houses were demolished and replaced by American-style buildings.  The new buildings were given some superfluous local traits, such as white roofs and coloured walls, but otherwise inherited nothing from local design.  As with the earlier British works, there was no lasting influence of these buildings on local architecture.&lt;ref name=Raine78&gt;Raine, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BBC Radio Cymru''' is [[BBC Cymru Wales]]' [[Welsh-language]] national radio network. It broadcasts two stations throughout Wales from studios in [[Cardiff]], [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], [[Aberystwyth]] and [[Carmarthen]] on [[frequency modulation|FM]], [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], digital TV and online. 

The main network broadcasts for {{frac|18|1|2}} hours a day from 5:30am to midnight with overnight programming carried from [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] during downtime. A second station, Radio Cymru 2, broadcasts on digital and online platforms, and provides separate breakfast programming for two hours every morning.

The managing editor of BBC Radio Cymru is Betsan Powys.

==Overview==
BBC Radio Cymru began broadcasting on the morning of Monday 3 January 1977, its first programme being an extended news bulletin presented at 6:45am by Gwyn Llewellyn and Geraint Jones. This was followed at 7am by the first edition of the breakfast magazine show ''{{lang|cy|Helo Bobol!}}'', presented by [[Hywel Gwynfryn]] with contributions from a network of local reporters in studios across Wales. The first record played on Radio Cymru was ''Ffrindiau Bore Oes'' by Hergest.

The station was the first broadcasting outlet dedicated wholly to programmes in Welsh, allowing much more airtime for such output than had previously been available on the old [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] Wales (or its predecessors the Welsh [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]] and, before that, the BBC Welsh [[BBC Regional Programme|Regional Programme]]).

At the time of the station's launch, it was the only radio service in the UK broadcasting exclusively on FM (VHF). Initially, the service was part-time and restricted to breakfast shows, extended news bulletins at breakfast, lunchtime &amp; early evening and a number of off-peak opt outs from a sustaining Radio 4 Wales feed.

In November 1979, Radio Cymru's programming was expanded to 65 hours a week, introducing mid-morning output on weekdays, along with a growing line-up of dramas, light entertainment and documentaries. The network continued to expand over the next two decades before achieving a continuous service of up to 20 hours a day.

Later developments in the 21st century saw Radio Cymru introducing a nightly youth strand, ''[[C2 (radio)|C2]]'', and regional opt-outs for South West Wales, which were axed in 2008 but later reintroduced to provide live commentary of [[Swansea City A.F.C.]] matches. The station has also been streaming online since January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Radio Cymru is similar in format to many "general" radio stations, with news programmes at breakfast (''{{lang|cy|Post Cyntaf}}'', 'First Post'), lunchtime (''{{lang|cy|Taro'r Post}}'' – a debate-centred programme), and [[drive-time]] (''{{lang|cy|Post Prynhawn}}'', 'Afternoon Post'); together with presenter-driven sequences mixing music with chat to invited studio guests, calls from listeners, competitions etc. Radio Cymru also produces drama, features, current affairs, youth, and sports programming. 

Over the years, it has done much to promote the language, with its sports commentators coining new terms which later became accepted by Welsh [[linguistics|linguists]]. One of its more unusual - and longest-running - programmes is ''{{lang|cy|Y Talwrn}}'', a poetry competition in which teams must come up with poetry in specific styles on specific topics.

==Listening figures==
As of March 2018, the station had 121,000 weekly listeners and a 2.9% market share.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rajar.co.uk/listening/quarterly_listening.php RAJAR]&lt;/ref&gt; An average Radio Cymru listener listened to the station for 12.4 hours each week. Radio Cymru has seen its weekly audience increase by 2,000 listeners since March 2017, where its weekly audience amounted to 119,000 listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://media.info/radio/stations/bbc-radio-cymru/listening-figures|title=BBC Radio Cymru - listening figures|website=media.info|language=en|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio Cymru 2==
On Monday 19 September 2016, BBC Cymru launched a second radio service, ''Radio Cymru Mwy'' (Radio Cymru More), as a trial pop-up station broadcasting for three months in the run-up to the station's 40th anniversary. Consisting of five hours of music-led entertainment programming each weekday, Radio Cymru Mwy was available on DAB in south east Wales and online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/bbc-radio-cymru-mwy-digital BBC Radio Cymru Mwy takes to the digital airwaves], bbc.co.uk, 2 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after the station closed, BBC Cymru announced it would launch a permanent second station, '''Radio Cymru 2'''. The new service airs for two hours every morning on digital and online platforms, as a music and entertainment alternative to the main network. Radio Cymru's morning output on the main service consists of the breakfast news programme, ''Post Cyntaf'', and a topical magazine show presented by Aled Hughes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/bbc-to-boost-wales-national-radio-stations BBC to boost Wales' national radio stations], bbc.co.uk, 23 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

BBC Radio Cymru 2 began broadcasting at 6.30am on Monday 29 January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/bbc-radio-cymru-2-2018 The countdown begins - BBC Radio Cymru 2 takes to the airwaves in January 2018], bbc.co.uk, 27 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It airs as an opt-out service from 6.30am - 8.30am on weekdays, 7-9am on Saturdays and 8-10am on Sundays.

The early 1980s, saw a burgeoning Indian arts scene and a renewed government focus on developing arts across the nation, through regional centres for arts in state capital cities. The initiative in Madhya Pradesh was taken by cultural administrator, [[Ashok Vajpeyi]],&lt;ref&gt;Vajpeyi later remained, chairman, [[Lalit Kala Akademi]], India's National Academy of Arts (2008-2011).&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Indian Administrative Services|IAS]]-officer in state Ministry of Education (1966-1992), who was behind the setting up of literary organization, 'Kalidas Academy' in [[Ujjain]], which opened in 1983. Though some cultural initiatives lost steam in later years in many parts of India, one such project became a success, Bharat Bhavan (India House) in Bhopal.&lt;ref name=ra/&gt;&lt;ref name=ab/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sa|Sahni, p. 87]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Progressive Artists' Group''', PAG, was a group of [[modern art]]ists, mainly based in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], from its formation in 1947. Though it lacked any particular style, there might be said to have been a move towards a synthesis of influences from Indian art history together with styles prevalent in Europe and North America during the first half of the 20th Century, including [[Post-Impressionist|Post-Impressionism]], [[Cubist|Cubism]] and [[Expressionistic|Expressionism]].

==History==
The Progressive Artists' Group was formed by six founder members, [[F. N. Souza]], [[S. H. Raza]],  [[M. F. Husain]], [[K. H. Ara]], [[H. A. Gade]], and [[S. K. Bakre]] (the only sculptor in the group). Others associated with the group included [[Manishi Dey]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Akbar Padamsee]] and [[Tyeb Mehta]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngmaindia.gov.in/sh-pag.asp National Gallery of Modern Art]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group wished to break with the revivalist nationalism established by the [[Bengal school of art]] and to encourage an Indian avant-garde, engaged at an international level.  The Group was formed just months after the 14 August 1947 "Partition of India" and Pakistan that resulted in religious rioting and death of tens of thousands of people displaced by the new borders. The founders of the Progressive Artists Group often cite "the partition" as impetus for their desire for new standards in India, starting with their new style of art.&lt;ref&gt;Ratan Parimoo and Nalini Bhagwat: Progressive Artists Group of Bombay: An Overview over The Spirit of Late 1940s and Early 1950s [http://www.artnewsnviews.com/view-article.php?article=progressive-artists-group-of-bombay-an-overview&amp;iid=29&amp;articleid=800]&lt;/ref&gt;  Their intention was to "paint with absolute freedom for content and technique, almost anarchic, save that we are governed by one or two sound elemental and eternal laws, of aesthetic order, plastic co-ordination and colour composition."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saffronart.com/sitepages/ArticleDetails.aspx?Articleid=9&amp;pageno=1 Overview of India Art: Progressive Artists Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde]], [[Prafulla Dahanukar]], [[Krishen Khanna]] and [[Mohan Samant]] joined the Group. Following the departure of the two main founders Souza and Raza from India few years later, S.K. Bakre also left the group, which ultimately disbanded in 1956.

European [[Modernism]] was the most distinctive influence on the group, but its members worked in dramatically different styles, from the Expressionism of Souza to the pure abstraction of Gaitonde. Specific Indian imagery and landscapes were also adopted, particularly by Mehta and Husain. Through the incorporation and mixture of new, abstract styles with traditional Indian art elements and Media, the PAG is one of the most influential art movements in India until today. 
In 2015, F.N. Souza's painting "Birth" set a new record for Indian art with a hammer price above US$ 4 Mio, which shows the worldwide appeal of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/souzas-birth-sets-new-record-sells-for-4-m-at-christies/138070/ | title=Souza’s ‘Birth’ sets new record, sold for $4 m at Christie’s | newspaper=Financial Express | date=19 September 2015 | accessdate=9 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Emotion}}
In conventional usage, '''boredom''' is an [[emotion]]al and occasionally [[psychology|psychological]] state experienced when an individual is left without anything in particular to do, is not interested in his or her surroundings, or feels that a day or period is dull or tedious. It is also understood by scholars as a modern phenomenon which has a cultural dimension. "There is no universally accepted definition of boredom. But whatever it is, researchers argue, it is not simply another name for depression or apathy. It seems to be a specific mental state that people find unpleasant—a lack of stimulation that leaves them craving relief, with a host of behavioural, medical and social consequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-boredom-is-anything-but-boring/|title=Why Boredom Is Anything but Boring|first=Maggie Koerth-Baker,Nature|last=magazine|date=|website=scientificamerican.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608101457/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-boredom-is-anything-but-boring/|archivedate=8 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to BBC  News, boredom "...can be a dangerous and disruptive state of mind that damages your health"; yet research "...suggest[s] that without boredom we couldn't achieve our creative feats."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141218-why-boredom-is-good-for-you|title=Psychology: Why boredom is bad... and good for you|first=David|last=Robson|date=|website=bbc.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824121704/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141218-why-boredom-is-good-for-you|archivedate=24 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''Experience Without Qualities: Boredom and Modernity'', Elizabeth Goodstein traces the modern discourse on boredom through literary, philosophical, and sociological texts to find that as "a discursively articulated phenomenon...boredom is at once objective and subjective, emotion and intellectualization — not just a response to the modern world but also a historically constituted strategy for coping with its discontents."&lt;ref&gt;Goodstein, Elizabeth S. 2005. Experience Without Qualities: Boredom and Modernity. Stanford: Stanford University Press. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In both conceptions, boredom has to do fundamentally with an experience of time and problems of meaning.

==Etymology and terminology==
The expression ''to be a bore'' had been used in print in the sense of "to be tiresome or dull" since 1768 at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=b&amp;p=27 |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2013-12-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213061635/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=b&amp;p=27 |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression "boredom" means "state of being bored," 1852, from bore (v.1) + -dom. It also has been employed in a sense "bores as a class" (1883) and "practice of being a bore" (1864, a sense properly belonging to boreism, 1833).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=boredom |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2015-12-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222163157/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=boredom |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "bore" as a noun meaning a "thing which causes ennui or annoyance" is attested to since 1778; "of persons by 1812". The noun "bore" comes from the verb "bore", which had the meaning "[to] be tiresome or dull" first attested [in] 1768, a vogue word c. 1780-81 according to Grose (1785); possibly a figurative extension of "to move forward slowly and persistently, as a [hole-] boring tool does."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=bore |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=2015-12-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222150953/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=bore |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French term for boredom, '''''ennui''''', is sometimes used in English as well, at least since 1778. The term ''ennui'' was first used "as a French word in English;" in the 1660s and it was "nativized by 1758".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ennui|title=ennui - Origin and meaning of ennui by Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216052339/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ennui|archivedate=16 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''ennui'' comes "from French ennui, from Old French enui "annoyance" (13c.), [a] back-formation from enoiier, anuier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ennui|title=ennui - Origin and meaning of ennui by Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216052339/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=ennui|archivedate=16 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The German word for "boredom" expresses this: ''[[wikt:Langeweile|Langeweile]]'', a compound made of ''lange'' "long" and ''Weile'' "while", which is in line with the common perception that when one is bored, time passes "tortuously" slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us|title=News, sport and opinion from the Guardian's US edition|author=|date=|website=the Guardian|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425213521/https://www.theguardian.com/us|archivedate=25 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different scholars use different definitions of ''boredom'', which complicates research.&lt;ref&gt;Vodanovich, Stephen J.  (November 2003) "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2f48/fb5444550d14c5b4a09e5a54d2a312221233.pdf Psychometric Measures of Boredom: A Review of the Literature]"  ''The Journal of Psychology''. '''137''':6 p. 569  "Indeed, a shortcoming of the boredom literature is the absence of a coherent, universally accepted definition. The lack of an agreed-upon definition of boredom has limited the measurement of the construct and partly accounts for the existence of diverse approaches to assessing various subsets of boredom."&lt;/ref&gt;  Boredom has been defined by Cynthia D. Fisher in terms of its main central [[psychological]] processes: "an unpleasant, transient [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] state in which the individual feels a pervasive lack of [[interest (emotion)|interest]] and difficulty concentrating on the current activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fisher|1993|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Leary]] et al. describe boredom as "an affective experience associated with cognitive attentional processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.5.968 |author1=Leary, M.

There are three types of boredom, all of which involve problems of engagement of [[attention]]. These include times when we are prevented from engaging in wanted activity, when we are forced to engage in unwanted activity, or when we are simply unable for no apparent reason to maintain engagement in any activity or spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2005.11.009 |author1=Cheyne, J.

[[Absent-mindedness]] is where a person shows inattentive or forgetful behaviour.&lt;ref name=ODam&gt;{{cite web|title=absent-minded|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/absent-minded|publisher=Oxford dictionaries|accessdate=5 August 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908132137/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/absent-minded|archivedate=8 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Absent-mindedness is a mental condition in which the subject experiences low levels of [[attention]] and frequent distraction. Absent-mindedness is not a diagnosed condition but rather a symptom of boredom and sleepiness which people experience in their daily lives. When suffering from absent-mindedness, people tend to show signs of memory lapse and weak recollection of recently occurring events. This can usually be a result of a variety of other conditions often diagnosed by clinicians such as [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. In addition to absent-mindedness leading to an array of consequences affecting daily life, it can have as more severe, long-term problems.

==Physical health==
[[Lethargy]] is a state of tiredness, weariness, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], or lack of energy. It can be accompanied by depression, decreased motivation, or apathy. Lethargy can be a normal response to boredom, inadequate sleep, overexertion, overworking, stress, lack of exercise, or a symptom of a disorder. When part of a normal response, lethargy often resolves with rest, adequate sleep, decreased stress, and good nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/symptom/lethargy|title=Lethargy: Causes, Symptoms and Diagnosis|author=|date=|website=www.healthline.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121080553/https://www.healthline.com/symptom/lethargy|archivedate=21 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall J.

==Philosophy==
Boredom is a condition characterized by [[perception]] of one's environment as dull, tedious, and lacking in [[stimulation]].  This can result from leisure and a lack of aesthetic interests.  [[Labour economics|Labor]] and [[art]] may be alienated and passive, or immersed in tedium. There is an inherent [[anxiety]] in boredom; people will expend considerable effort to prevent or remedy it, yet in many circumstances, it is accepted as suffering to be endured. Common passive ways to escape boredom are to sleep or to think creative thoughts ([[daydream]]).  Typical active solutions consist in an intentional activity of some sort, often something new, as familiarity and [[wikt:repetition|repetition]] lead to the tedious.

During the [[fin de siècle]], the French term for the end of the 19th century in the West, some of the cultural hallmarks included "ennui", [[cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], [[pessimism]], and "...a widespread belief that civilization leads to [[decadence]]."&lt;ref&gt;Meštrović, Stjepan G.  ''The Coming Fin de Siecle: An Application of Durkheim's Sociology to modernity and postmodernism.'' Oxon, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge (1992 [1991]: 2). Pireddu, Nicoletta. "Primitive marks of modernity: cultural reconfigurations in the Franco-Italian fin de siècle," _Romanic Review_, 97 (3-4), 2006: 371-400.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boredom also plays a role in [[existentialism|existentialist]] thought. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] were two of the first philosophers considered fundamental to the existentialist movement. Like [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], they were interested in people's quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversion to escape from boredom. Kierkegaard's ''[[Either/Or]]'' describes the [[rotation method]], a method used by higher level aesthetes in order to avoid boredom. The method is an essential [[hedonism|hedonistic]] aspect of the aesthetic way of life. For the aesthete, one constantly changes what one is doing in order to maximize the enjoyment and pleasure derived from each activity.

In contexts where one is confined, spatially or otherwise, boredom may be met with various religious activities, not because religion would want to associate itself with tedium, but rather, partly because boredom may be taken as the essential human condition, to which God, wisdom, or morality are the ultimate answers. It is taken in this sense by virtually all existentialist philosophers as well as by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].

[[Martin Heidegger]] wrote about boredom in two texts available in English, in the 1929/30 semester lecture course ''The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics'', and again in the essay ''What is Metaphysics?'' published in the same year. In the lecture, Heidegger included about 100 pages on boredom, probably the most extensive philosophical treatment ever of the subject. He focused on waiting at [[railway station]]s in particular as a major context of boredom.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger. ''The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics'', pp. 78–164.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Søren Kierkegaard]] remarks in ''[[Either/Or]]'' that "patience cannot be depicted" visually, since there is a sense that any immediate moment of life may be fundamentally tedious.

[[Blaise Pascal]] in the ''[[Pensées]]'' discusses the human condition in saying "we seek rest in a struggle against some obstacles. And when we have overcome these, rest proves unbearable because of the boredom it produces", and later states that "only an infinite and immutable object – that is, God himself – can fill this infinite abyss."&lt;ref name="Pensées"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Pensées | url = https://books.google.com/?id=DdlNuvGMPisC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Blaise+Pascal%22 | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-87220-717-2 | last1 = Pascal| first1 =  Blaise |last2 =  Ariew| first2 =  Roger | accessdate = 2009-07-27 | publisher = Hackett Pub. Co. | location = Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without stimulus or focus, the individual is confronted with [[nothing]]ness, the meaninglessness of existence, and experiences existential [[anxiety]]. Heidegger states this idea as follows: "Profound boredom, drifting here and there in the abysses of our existence like a muffling fog, removes all things and men and oneself along with it into a remarkable indifference. This boredom reveals being as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''What is Metaphysics?'' (1929)&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer used the existence of boredom in an attempt to prove the [[vanity]] of human existence, stating, "...for if life, in the desire for which our essence and existence consists, possessed in itself a positive value and real content, there would be no such thing as boredom: mere existence would fulfil and satisfy us."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, Essays and Aphorisms, Penguin Classics, {{ISBN|0-14-044227-8}} (2004), p53 Full text available online: [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0140442278&amp;id=AZUe_0tOZIUC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=e-esU4GaO5&amp;dq=arthur+schopenhauer+books&amp;sig=Jze2WQysljLWFYQKTr_Oh-UHsE0 Google Books Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erich Fromm]] and other thinkers of [[critical theory]] speak of boredom as a common psychological response to industrial society, where people are required to engage in [[alienated labor]]. According to Fromm, boredom is "perhaps the most important source of aggression and destructiveness today." For Fromm, the search for thrills and novelty that characterizes consumer culture are not solutions to boredom, but mere distractions from boredom which, he argues, continues unconsciously.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich Fromm]], [http://www.erich-fromm.de/data/pdf/1972c-e.pdf "Theory of Aggression"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513020501/http://www.erich-fromm.de/data/pdf/1972c-e.pdf |date=May 13, 2011 }} pg.7&lt;/ref&gt; Above and beyond taste and character, the universal case of boredom consists in any instance of ''waiting'', as Heidegger noted, such as in line, for someone else to arrive or finish a task, or while one is travelling somewhere. The automobile requires fast reflexes, making its operator busy and hence, perhaps for other reasons as well, making the ride more tedious despite being over sooner. 

Interestingly, in some [[Nguni languages|Nguni]] languages such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]], boredom and loneliness are represented by the same word (isizungu). This adds a new dimension to the oft-quoted definition of [[Ubuntu philosophy|ubuntu]]: "A person is a person through other people".

Although it has not been widely studied, research on boredom suggests that boredom is a major factor impacting diverse areas of a person's life. People ranked low on a boredom-proneness scale were found to have better performance in a wide variety of aspects of their lives, including career, education, and autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Watt, J. D. |author2=Vodanovich, S. J. |title=Boredom Proneness and Psychosocial Development |journal=Journal of Psychology |volume=133 |issue=1 |pages=149–155 |year=1999 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4679(200001)56:1&lt;149::AID-JCLP14&gt;3.0.CO;2-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boredom can be a symptom of [[clinical depression]]. Boredom can be a form of [[learned helplessness]], a phenomenon closely related to depression. Some philosophies of [[parenting]] propose that if children are raised in an environment devoid of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and are not allowed or encouraged to interact with their environment, they will fail to develop the mental capacities to do so.

In a learning environment, a common cause of boredom is lack of understanding; for instance, if one is not following or connecting to the material in a class or lecture, it will usually seem boring. However, the opposite can also be true; something that is too easily understood, simple or transparent, can also be boring. Boredom is often inversely related to [[learning]], and in school it may be a sign that a student is not challenged enough, or too challenged. An activity that is predictable to the students is likely to bore them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED397840 Ed.gov] – R.V. Small et al.  ''Dimensions of Interest and Boredom in Instructional Situations'', Proceedings of Selected Research and Development Presentations at the 1996 National Convention of the Association for Educational Communications and Technology (18th, Indianapolis, IN), (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1989 study indicated that an individual's impression of boredom may be influenced by the individual's degree of [[attention]], as a higher acoustic level of distraction from the environment correlated with higher reportings of boredom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Damrad-Frye| first = R|author2=Laird JD| title = The experience of boredom: the role of the self-perception of attention| year = 1989| journal = J Personality Social Psych| volume = 57| pages = 315–20| doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.57.2.315| issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boredom has been studied as being related to [[drug abuse]] among teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iso-Ahola, Seppo E. |author2=Crowley, Edward D. |title=Adolescent Substance Abuse and Leisure Boredom |journal=Journal of Leisure Research |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=260–71 |year=1991 |url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=EJ429375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boredom has been proposed as a cause of [[pathological gambling]] behavior.

==In the workplace==
{{Main article|Boreout}}
[[Boreout]] is a [[management theory]] that posits that lack of work, boredom, and consequent lack of satisfaction are a common malaise affecting individuals working in modern organizations, especially in office-based white collar jobs. This theory was first expounded in 2007 in ''Diagnose Boreout'', a book by Peter Werder and Philippe Rothlin, two Swiss business consultants. They claim the absence of meaningful tasks, rather than the presence of stress, is many workers' chief problem.

A "[[banishment room]]" (also known as a "chasing-out-room" and a "boredom room") is a modern [[employee exit management]] strategy whereby employees are transferred to a department where they are assigned meaningless work until they become disheartened enough to quit.&lt;ref name=Torres&gt;{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Ida|title=Japanese companies using 'banishment rooms' to push employees to resign|url=http://japandailypress.com/japanese-companies-using-banishment-rooms-to-push-employees-to-resign-3029793/|accessdate=24 August 2013|newspaper=Japan Daily Press|date=May 30, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815050741/http://japandailypress.com/japanese-companies-using-banishment-rooms-to-push-employees-to-resign-3029793/|archivedate=15 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ASAHI&gt;{{cite news|title=BANISHMENT ROOM: Top companies under investigation over unfair labor practices |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201301290071 |accessdate=23 August 2013 |newspaper=THE ASAHI SHIMBUN |date=January 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919011307/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201301290071 |archivedate=19 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TABUCHI&gt;{{cite news|last=TABUCHI|first=HIROKO|title=Layoffs Taboo, Japan Workers Are Sent to the Boredom Room|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/business/global/layoffs-illegal-japan-workers-are-sent-to-the-boredom-room.html|accessdate=23 August 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 16, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822220641/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/business/global/layoffs-illegal-japan-workers-are-sent-to-the-boredom-room.html|archivedate=22 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the resignation is voluntary, the employee would not be eligible for certain benefits.

{{Main article|Superfluous man}}
The superfluous man ({{lang-ru|лишний человек}}, ''lishniy chelovek'') is an 1840s and 1850s Russian literary concept derived from the [[Byronic hero]].&lt;ref name=c1&gt;{{Harvnb|Chances|2001|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to an individual, perhaps talented and capable, who does not fit into social norms. In most cases, this person is born into wealth and privilege.  Typical characteristics are disregard for social values, [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], and [[Existentialism|existential]] boredom; typical behaviors are gambling, drinking, smoking, sexual intrigues, and [[duel]]s.  He is often unempathetic and carelessly distresses others with his actions.

==History==

===1986–1992===

Cooking Vinyl was set up in 1986 by former manager and booking agent [[Martin Goldschmidt]] and distribution manager Pete Lawrence, who initially ran the business as a part-time venture out of a spare room in Goldschmidt's council house in Stockwell, South London.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2016/10/martin-goldschmidt-industry-profile-w-larry-leblanc-interview.html|title=Cooking Vinyl's Martin Goldschmidt On 30 Years of Indie Music|publisher=HypeBot|accessdate=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Cooking Vinyl recorded an impromptu live performance around a campfire at a folk festival by the singer [[Michelle Shocked]], on a Sony [[Walkman]] with fading batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2012/03/big-chills-pete-lawrence-and-unbound-crowdfund-alfresco-festival-with-book-release.html|title=New Take On Music Crowdfunding From Cooking Vinyl's Pete Lawrence &amp; Book Publisher Unbound|publisher=Hypebot.com|date=2012-03-29|accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its first releases, Cooking Vinyl released the recording as The Campfire Tapes, and it sold 250,000 copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1989, the company was close to bankruptcy when their distributors, [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]], went into receivership. Pete Lawrence sold his stake in the business to Martin Goldschmidt who continued the business while servicing the debt of the company of a period of five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cooking Vinyl's Martin Goldschmidt On 30 Years of Indie Music |url=https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2016/10/martin-goldschmidt-industry-profile-w-larry-leblanc-interview.html |website=Hype Bot |publisher=Hype Bot |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1993–1999===
Besides traditional royalty agreements, Cooking Vinyl developed ‘artist services’ deals in the 1990s, where the artist retains ownership of the copyright of their recorded material.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themusicnetwork.com/hot-seat-martin-goldschmidt-founder-cooking-vinyl/|title=Hot Seat: Martin Goldschmidt – Founder, Cooking Vinyl|publisher=[[The Music Network]]|date=2013-12-06|accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these contracts was done in 1993 for the reissue of [[Billy Bragg]]'s ''[[Back to Basics (Billy Bragg album)|Back To Basics]]'' compilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/festival-of-business/9075644/Why-music-is-still-good-business.html|title=Why music is still good business|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]|date=2012-02-11|accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Bragg has re-engaged with Cooking Vinyl a total of six times, most recently in 2013 for the release of studio album ''[[Tooth &amp; Nail (Billy Bragg album)|Tooth And Nail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/billy-bragg-re-signs-with-cooking-vinyl/053181|title=Billy Bragg re-signs with Cooking Vinyl|publisher=[[Music Week]]|date=2013-01-16|accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Connor and E F Robertson] February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Battle of Belgium|German invasion in 1940]], the Stein family fled to the [[United States]], first arriving in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=StAndrews /&gt; He graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in 1949,&lt;ref name=StAndrews /&gt; where he was classmates with future [[Fields Medalist]] [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourstrongband.org/history/timeline-1940.html |title=Stuyvesant High School Endowment Fund |accessdate=2013-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111165649/http://www.ourstrongband.org/history/timeline-1940.html |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving on to the [[University of Chicago]] for college. In 1955, Stein earned a Ph.D. from the [[University of Chicago]] under the direction of [[Antoni Zygmund]]. He began teaching in [[MIT]] in 1955, moved to the University of Chicago in 1958 as an assistant professor, and in 1963 became a full professor at Princeton, the position he currently holds.

Stein has worked primarily in the field of [[harmonic analysis]], and has made contributions in both extending and clarifying [[Calderón–Zygmund theory]].  These include ''Stein interpolation'' (a variable-parameter version of [[complex interpolation]]), the ''Stein maximal principle'' (showing that under many circumstances, [[almost everywhere convergence]] is equivalent to the boundedness of
a [[maximal function]]), ''[[Stein complementary series representation]]s'', ''Nikishin–Pisier–Stein factorization'' in operator theory, the ''Tomas–Stein restriction theorem'' in [[Fourier analysis]], the ''Kunze–Stein phenomenon'' in [[convolution]] on [[semisimple group]]s, the [[Cotlar–Stein lemma]] concerning the sum of almost orthogonal operators, and the Fefferman–Stein theory of the [[Hardy space]] &lt;math&gt;H^1&lt;/math&gt; and the space &lt;math&gt;BMO&lt;/math&gt; of functions of bounded mean oscillation.

He has written numerous books on harmonic analysis (see e.g. [1,3,5]), which are often cited as the standard references on the subject. His ''[[Princeton Lectures in Analysis]]'' series [6,7,8,9] were penned for his sequence of undergraduate courses on analysis at Princeton. Stein is also noted as having trained a high number of graduate students (he has had at least 51 students, according to the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]]), so shaping modern Fourier analysis. They include two [[Fields medal]]ists, [[Charles Fefferman]] and [[Terence Tao]].

His honors include the [[Steele Prize]] (1984 and 2002), the [[Schock Prize]] in Mathematics (1993), the [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] (1999), and the [[National Medal of Science]] (2001). In addition, he has fellowships to [[National Science Foundation]], [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation|Sloan Foundation]], [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim Foundation]], and [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. In 2005, Stein was awarded the [[Stefan Bergman]] prize in recognition of his contributions in real, complex, and harmonic analysis. In 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-08-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1959, he married Elly Intrator,&lt;ref name=StAndrews /&gt; a former [[Jewish]] refugee during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://access.cjh.org/home.php?type=extid&amp;term=1525679#1 Center for Jewish History: "AHC interview with Elly Stein"] 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children, Karen Stein and [[Jeremy C. Stein]],&lt;ref name=StAndrews /&gt; and grandchildren named Alison, Jason, and Carolyn. His son Jeremy is a  professor of financial economics at Harvard, former adviser to [[Tim Geithner]] and [[Lawrence Summers]], and was appointed to the [[Federal Reserve Board of Governors]] by President [[Barack Obama]] in 2011.

'''Francis Fabien Michel Muguet''' (1955–2009) was a [[French people|French]] chemist who advocated open access to information.

==Biography==
Muguet graduated with a Ph.D from [[Texas Tech University]] with a thesis on water chemistry in 1992. His advisor was G. Wilse Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Investigations of Diffuse Intermolecular Electronic Systems |author= Francis F. Muguet, M.S. |date= May 1992 |publisher= Texas Tech University |url= http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-02262009-31295007098873/unrestricted/31295007098873.pdf |accessdate= July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He also held a law degree. He was a researcher at [[ENSTA]] (Ecole Nationale Superieure de Techniques Avancées) from 1993 to 2009 and worked, during the last months of his life, as a consultant for [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) and the [[University of Geneva]].

Defender of the free and open access to scientific content,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biomedcentral.com/openaccess/archive/?page=features&amp;issue=17 Lobbying for Open Access legislation]&lt;/ref&gt; he chaired the Civil Society Scientific Information Working Group, and co-ordinated a group on patents, trademarks and copyrights at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8194812893544942709# Dr. Francis Muguet's speech at Geneva]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=301222277851752196# Dr. Francis Muguet's speech at Tunis]&lt;/ref&gt;

Muguet is also known for designing the pattern of global patronage which aims to answer the legal argument raised against the global license under the Berne Convention on copyright. The sponsorship was supported by his friend [[Richard Stallman]] who co-authored with him the Declaration of Louisiana at a workshop organized by the French Society of the Internet on March 12, 2009. Muguet was then one of the founders of the SARD, a Society of acceptance and distribution of gifts inspired by the principles of global patronage.
His daughter found him on October 14, dead after not answering his mail for several days.
Following the announcement of his death, a change was made in the process of printing the book ''La bataille Hadopi'', to which he had contributed, dedicating it to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=  Francis Muguet est mort |author= Mathieu Pasquini |date= October 17, 2009 |work= In Libro Veritas Bibliotheca |url= http://www.ilv-bibliotheca.net/blog/index.php?post/2009/10/17/Francis-Muguet-est-mort |accessdate= July 10, 2011 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= La bataille Hadopi |publisher= In libro veritas |year= 2009 |isbn= 978-2-35922-016-2 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muguet was active in the World Network for Linguistic Diversity and point of contact for the Dynamic Coalition for Linguistic Diversity of the [[Internet Governance Forum]] and a member of [[ICVolunteers]]. From 2001 to 2005, he was Associate Editor MDPI Center Basel.

'''''Gukjeong chumyo''''' is an 18th-century [[Korean painting]] depicting a crouching cat under wild chrysanthemum on an autumn day. It was drawn by [[Byeon Sang-byeok]], a representative animal painter during the late period of the [[Korea]]n [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1910). ''Gukjeong chumyo'' literally means "An autumn cat in a garden with chrysanthemum" and is of the ''yeongmohwa'', or  [[animal painting]], genre. It is painted on paper with light coloring over the [[ink and wash painting]] (''sumukhwa''). The size of the painting is {{convert|29.5|cm|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|23.4|cm|abbr=on}} in width. It is currently stored at [[Gansong Art Museum]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="Daum"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://culturedic.daum.net/dictionary_content.asp?Dictionary_Id=10021596&amp;mode=content&amp;query=%B1%B9%C1%A4%C3%DF%B9%A6&amp;dircode=0 |script-title=ko:국정추묘 菊庭秋猫 |trans-title=Gukjeong chumyo |publisher=[[Daum Communications|Daum]]/ National Culture Archetype |language=Korean |accessdate=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byeon Sang-byeok is renowned for his skillful depictions of cats and chickens, so he was referred to by the nicknames "Byeon goyangi" (literally "Byeon cat") and "Byeon dak" (Byeon rooster) during his lifetime. His representative paintings include ''[[Myojakdo]]'' (Painting of Cats and Sparrows), and ''[[Hwajomyogudo]]'' (Painting of Flowers, Birds, and Puppies). The cat in the picture is crouching and gazing at something, and seems ready to swiftly run off.&lt;ref name="Daum" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11731">The '''Heart of the City''' is a long-term project aiming at the redevelopment of the historic centre of [[Kaliningrad]], the area surrounding the former [[Königsberg Castle]] and the [[House of Soviets (Kaliningrad)|House of Soviets]]. The project implementation unit is a Non-governmental organization Urban Planning Bureau “Heart of the City” (Russian name: Градостроительное бюро «Сердце города»), located in Kaliningrad, [[Russia]].

== About ==

The project emerged as a joint initiative of the members of the [[Ministry of Culture (Russia)|Ministry of Culture]] working under the leadership of the Governor of Kaliningrad Region, [[Nikolay Tsukanov]]. The Ministry of Culture under the Governor of the Kaliningrad Region is an advisory body established in 2005 designed to foster cooperation between cultural institutions, mass media, NGOs, the artistic and cultural community, and to develop proposals on different issues in the sphere of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Background ==
Because of the severe damages during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and uncompleted town planning projects of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, so far, the city centre of Kaliningrad remains virtually empty and undeveloped in terms of urban infrastructure and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| access-date = 2016-02-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, after several years of public and expert consultations held with Russian and foreign experts, the Kaliningrad Oblast Government launched the long-term program for the systematic regeneration of the historical part of the city, which is known for its seven centuries of history as [[Königsberg]] and still preserves some features of its original urban fabric. To implement the project named “Heart of the City”, the “road map” was developed to cover the areas of the King’s Mountain (Korolevskaya gora), the adjacent embankment of the [[Pregolya River]] and the [[Lower Pond (Kaliningrad)|Lower Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| access-date = 2016-02-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
In 2013, the Historic and cultural study of the “Heart of the City” project areas was conducted to set the basis for further activities within the project. The researchers determined the boundaries of twelve historic areas (corresponding to former Königsberg city parts), analysed their historic and cultural assets, and made recommendations for their future development. The study was presented to the local authorities and discussed with professionals and the local community on numerous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Urban Planning Bureau “Heart of the City” organised and conducted an international architectural and urban planning competition for the Development Concept of  the historic centre of Kaliningrad. The professional jury panel was represented by Bart Goldhoorn, Hans Stimmann, Barbara Engel, Rasmus Waern, Stephen Willacy, Olov Schultz, Alexander Lozhkin and Anna Brunow. The competition intended to find a new concept of the urban planning development of the area called “Korolevskaya Gora“ (Germ. Königsberg) and its surroundings (in total 56 ha). The winner emerging out of this competition was the [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg’s]] team of architects “Studio 44“ in partnership with  St. Petersburg’s Institute of Territorial Development. The winners proposed an individual development scenario that would "take the interplay between heritage and contemporary context to a totally new level."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former [[Altstadt (Königsberg)|Altstadt]] would become a zone of archaeological research with a new medieval city growing on top of the ruined one. The reconstructed historic urban fabric and the strict regulations governing the height and the shape of the buildings, roof-slope angles and the use of finishing materials will generate echoes of something recognizably old-European.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The consolidated planning concept formed the basis for the revisions of the current urban planning documents concerning the historic centre of Kaliningrad and led to a new open international design competition “Post-castle“ that was announced in May 2015. The competition sought to find an architectural image for a Historic and cultural complex on the grounds of the former [[Königsberg Castle]] that will accommodate a multifunctional concert hall, a museum of archaeology, a museum of the King’s castle history and other functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

His design managed to combine all the requirements and particularly impressed the jury with the quality of the draft and the idea of creating several public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/antonsagal/docs/another_castle/1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current situation ==
At present, the competition winner has been contracted for a conceptual design of the Historic and cultural complex. The Bureau continues working closely with local authorities to ensure that the results of both competitions are incorporated in the urban planning documents for the project area. The local authorities announced plans to start archaeological excavations on the grounds of the former Königsberg Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Independent News Co.''' was a [[magazine]] and [[comic book]] [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] business owned by [[National Periodical Publications]], the parent company of [[DC Comics]]. Independent News distributed all DC publications, as well as those of a few rival publishers, such as [[Marvel Comics]] from 1957 to 1969, in addition to [[Pulp magazine|pulp]] and popular magazines. The company was founded in 1932 and operated until c. 1970.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In 1929, as a favor to an old client, pulp magazine publisher [[Harry Donenfeld]] gave work to the client's son, [[Jack Liebowitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gerard, ''Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book'' (Basic Books, 2004) {{ISBN|978-0-465-03656-1}}, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Donenfeld and Liebowitz had little in common, but Liebowitz soon emerged as a man who could run finances.&lt;ref name="Gerard89"&gt;Jones, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Donenfeld would promise the world to clients without understanding the economic realities, Liebowitz was bookish and ensured bills were paid on time and helped create a respectability in the firm. Soon the two men were spoken of as a partnership.

When Liebowitz first worked for Donenfeld, the latter's empire was little more than a publishing house for "sex pulp" and art nudie magazines distributed by [[Eastern News]], a company run by Charles Dreyfus and [[Paul Sampliner]]. In 1931, Eastern News faced [[bankruptcy]] and could no longer pay its publishers; the company owed Donenfeld alone $30,000. A compromise was called for, and Donenfeld, not wanting to find himself hamstrung by a distributor again, approached Sampliner with the idea of creating the '''Independent News Company''', a publishing house with its own distribution system.&lt;ref name="Gerard88-89"&gt;Jones, pg 88&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Sampliner running the distribution end,&lt;ref name="Cooke" /&gt; Donenfeld as salesman, Harry's youngest brother Irving (not to be mistaken for Harry's son: [[Irwin Donenfeld]] &lt;ref&gt;Alter Ego #26, pg 53. Irwin Donenfeld says: "I was the only Irwin. My uncle Irving..."&lt;/ref&gt;) as head printer, and Liebowitz running the finances, they launched Independent News in 1932.&lt;ref name="Gerard89-92"&gt;Jones, pp. 89–92.&lt;/ref&gt; The Donenfeld brothers had begun as printers, and they continued printing the company's magazine and comic book covers even after branching into distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=INDEPENDENT+NEWS Independent News entry], Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928–1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now Donenfeld was a distributor as well as a publisher, and was now no longer reliant on others to run his business. As a publisher, Donenfeld had managed to dodge creditors and break deals, but as a distributor, he came to rely more on Liebowitz to ensure that the company ran smoothly. Liebowitz ensured bills were paid on time and began to build a trust with clients that Donenfeld's enterprises had never experienced.&lt;ref name="Gerard92"&gt;Jones, pg 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion ===
In 1935, writer/entrepreneur [[Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson]] approached Independent News in a bid to relaunch his comic book ''[[More Fun Comics|New Fun]]'', having lost his previous backers due to poor sales and debts. Donenfeld accepted to distribute the comic but with heavy loss of rights to Wheeler-Nicholson. Wheeler-Nicholson produced two more titles to be handled by Independent News, ''New Comics'' and ''[[Detective Comics]]'' (which would later see the first appearance of [[Batman]]), now under the banner of '''Detective Comics Incorporated''', in which Wheeler-Nicholson was forced to take Donenfeld and Liebowitz as partners. In 1938, Donenfeld sued Wheeler-Nicholson for nonpayment and Detective Comics Inc. went into bankruptcy. Not too surprisingly Donenfeld bought up the company and Wheeler-Nicholson's [[National Allied Publications]] in their entirety as part of the action.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 101–102, 107–108, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth publication under National Allied Publications would be ''[[Action Comics]]'' (1938). Issue #1 introduced the superhero, [[Superman]], created by artist [[Joe Shuster]] and writer [[Jerry Siegel]], and the character's popularity created incredible profits; not only in comic book sales, but also in merchandising such as toys, costumes and even a [[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|radio show]]. At the end of 1941 Donenfeld's comic businesses took in $2.6 million.&lt;ref name="Gerard142"&gt;Jones, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Gaines]], future founder of [[EC Comics]], formed [[All-American Publications]] in 1938 after successfully seeking funding from Harry Donenfeld.,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Gerard Jones]] writes of Donenfeld's investment:
{{blockquote|Harry had agreed on one condition: that [Gaines] take [Detective Comics partner] Jack Liebowitz on as his partner. ... Jack would be tempted to leave and form a competing company if there was nothing to hold him. And it may well have been a way for Harry to keep Gaines under control; since Jack was still drawing a salary and significant bonuses from Detective Comics and [self-distributorship] Independent News, he wouldn't let Gaines take off on his own or act against the interests of the other companies. ... Gaines became the principal and Jack Liebowitz the minority owner of All-American [Publications].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1946, Gaines let Liebowitz buy him out, keeping only ''Picture Stories from the Bible'' as the foundation of his own new company, [[EC Comics]]. "Liebowitz promptly orchestrated the merger of All-American and Detective Comics into National Comics.... Next he took charge of organizing National Comics, Independent News, and their affiliated firms into  a single corporate entity, '''National Periodical Publications'''".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consolidation ===
The biggest magazine distribution company of this era was [[American News Company]], which had a virtual [[monopoly]] on all comics except DC's. From 1952 to 1957 [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]] publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]] distributed his company's comics to newsstands through his self-owned distributor, Atlas. He then switched to American News — which shortly afterward lost a [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] [[lawsuit]] and discontinued its business.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gerard. ''Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book'' (Basic Books, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Atlas was left without distribution and was forced to turn to its biggest rival, [[DC Comics|National (DC) Comics]]. As then-Atlas editor [[Stan Lee]] recalled in a 1988 interview:
{{quote|text=... [We had been] turning out 40, 50, 60 books a month, maybe more, and ... suddenly we went ... to either eight or 12 books a month, which was all Independent News Distributors would accept from us.&lt;ref name="Stan and Roy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/02stanroy.html |title=Stan the Man &amp; Roy the Boy: A Conversation Between Stan Lee and Roy Thomas |work=[[Comic Book Artist]] |issue=2 |date=Summer 1998 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lHwfKOI2?url=http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/02stanroy.html |archivedate=November 14, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[American Comics Group]], another comic book publisher from the era (also with ties to Harry Donenfeld), was distributed by Independent News, as were such popular magazines as ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Family Circle]]''.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;Cooke, Jon B. "Donenfeld's Comics: A Talk with Irwin Donenfeld, 1960s DC Editorial Director," Comic Book Artist Collection, vol. 2. (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2002), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jack Liebowitz]] stayed with Independent News until 1965, eventually becoming a co-owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=LIEBOWITZ%2c+JACK Liebowitz entry], Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928–1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irwin Donenfeld]], who was DC's editorial director in the 1960s, was also a vice president of Independent News.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=DONENFELD%2c+IRWIN Donenfeld entry], Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928–1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sale and demise ===
In 1967, National Periodical Publications (including Independent News) was purchased by [[Kinney National Company]], which later purchased [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] and became [[Warner Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/dc.htm "DC Comics,"] Don Markstein's Toonopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; The Donenfelds and their "crew" were out, and new management came in. By 1970, Independent News was defunct, absorbed into a larger and changing distribution business. Independent News' last president was [[Harold Chamberlin]], who served from 1968-1970. Chamblerin went on to become president of Warner Publishing from 1970–1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=CHAMBERLIN%2c+HAROLD Chamberlin entry], Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928–1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[List of assets owned by Time Warner|Warner Publishing Services]], the company was named by DC Comics as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication ''[[Fifty Who Made DC Great]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = Marx, Barry| cowriters = [[Joey Cavalieri|Cavalieri, Joey]] and Hill, Thomas| artist = Petruccio, Steven | editor = Marx, Barry| story = Warner Publishing Services Fifty Years of Distributing Comics| title = Fifty Who Made DC Great| date = 1985| publisher = DC Comics| page = 12| panel = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John McRobbie Gordon''', ''né'' '''John McRobbie''' (12 October 1857 &amp;ndash; 22 February 1944) was a Scottish singer, actor, stage manager and director, known as an influential stage director of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] after the death of [[W. S. Gilbert]].

In his early career Gordon appeared in the chorus and minor roles in D'Oyly Carte productions, and after a period as a freelance actor, manager and director, he returned to the company permanently in 1910, as stage manager, and later stage director, establishing a reputation as a firm disciplinarian and upholder of the performing practices originated by Gilbert.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Gordon was born in [[Lumphanan]], Aberdeenshire, the eldest son of Samuel McRobbie, a carpenter and farmer.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon,  p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon retained his Aberdeen accent throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;"Obituary", ''The Glasgow Herald'', 25 February 1944&lt;/ref&gt; The family was musical and did not discourage the boy's ambitions for a career as a singer. He studied at the short-lived Aberdeen Conservatoire before moving to London in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 10 and 13&lt;/ref&gt; He took his mother's maiden name as a stage name to avoid embarrassing his more puritanical relatives, who disapproved of the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Introduction and p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; He joined a touring opera company, playing [[baritone]] roles in such works as ''[[La Sonnambula]]'' and ''[[Fra Diavolo]]''. In 1881 he was understudy to the baritone lead in the [[West End theatre|West End]] production of [[Edmond Audran|Audran]]'s ''[[La Mascotte]]''. Further small roles in touring opera companies followed. In 1883, while playing Marvejol in Audran's ''[[Les noces d'Olivette|Olivette]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Olivette at West Hartlepool", ''The North-Eastern Daily Gazette'', 4 January 1904, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; he married a fellow member of the company, May Piemonté.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 21 and 27&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 Gordon joined one of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] touring companies as a member of the chorus in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]''. In 1884, he played the part of Colonel Calverley in ''Patience'' on tour.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon,  p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] saw him perform and offered him the chance to join the main London company at the [[Savoy Theatre]], as a chorus member and understudy.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon remained a member of the company until 1890, playing Piscator in ''[[The Carp (opera)|The Carp]]'', a one-act [[curtain raiser (drama)|curtain raiser]], when it accompanied ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), and Harrington Jarramie in ''[[Mrs. Jarramie's Genie]]'' (another curtain raiser), when it accompanied ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888).&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/G/GordonJM.htm J.M. Gordon], Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 17 July 2014, accessed 21 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He was in the chorus in the original runs of  ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), ''Ruddigore'', ''The Yeomen of the Guard'' and ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889), and the 1885 revival of  ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' and ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' at the Savoy.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

In the 1890s, Gordon managed, and acted in, his own touring company, "The Gordon 'At Home' Party". It comprised variously four or five performers, playing a series of short pieces including ''[[Mock Turtles (opera)|Mock Turtles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 14 August 1897, p. 12; and "Local Topics", ''Shoreditch Observer'', 11 December 1897, p. 3 &lt;/ref&gt; He also ran his own band.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt; By the early 1900s, he was working as a freelance conductor and stage director for British amateur operatic societies. Among the works he directed were Sullivan's ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'', [[Robert Planquette|Planquette's]] ''[[Les cloches de Corneville]]'', [[Alfred Cellier|Cellier]]'s ''[[Dorothy (opera)|Dorothy]]'' and ''[[The Mountebanks]]'', and Gilbert's play ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 59, 60 and 62&lt;/ref&gt;

===D'Oyly Carte stage manager and director===
Throughout his freelance period Gordon maintained his links with D'Oyly Carte, coaching young singers for the touring companies and the Savoy in his spare time. After Carte's death in 1901, Gordon continued to coach singers for [[Helen Carte]] after she took over the opera company. In March 1907 he served as [[stage manager]] to the D'Oyly Carte touring company.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; At the Savoy in July of that year, during the D'Oyly Carte's first London repertory season, he directed the revival of ''[[Iolanthe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 21; and Bullough, John Malcolm. "Deeside Man Carries On Gilbert Traditions", ''Aberdeen Press and Journal'', 13 December 1937, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910 Gordon accepted Helen Carte's offer of a permanent position as stage manager to the company, and he gave up his freelance activities.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert died in 1911, and Helen Carte died two years later. The opera company was inherited by her stepson, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]], who, according to a 2014 biographical sketch of Gordon, needed a stage manager who would maintain the company's production standards and preserve Gilbert's traditions and style. Gordon's skills, attention to detail and tenacity, together with his experience with the company under Gilbert's direction, were what Carte required.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt; One of Carte's priorities was to arrive at an authorised text. Over the years Gilbert had tweaked his libretti, removing out-of-date references and adding new ones. He had also permitted a few interpolations by senior members of the company. Gordon, whose close contacts with Gilbert had included work on the [[prompt book]]s for the Savoy operas, was entrusted with preparing an authoritative set of libretti. In general, he retained the few "gags" that Gilbert had approved, and otherwise returned to the original 1870s and '80s texts.&lt;ref name=j165/&gt;{{refn|"Gags" approved by Gilbert and retained by Gordon included Pooh-Bah's "No money – no grovel!" and Nanki-Poo's "Modified rapture!" in ''The Mikado''. Examples of Gordon’s removal of Gilbert's own updatings included reverting from "a tuppenny tube young man" to the original "a threepenny bus young man" in ''Patience''.&lt;ref name=j165&gt;Joseph, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}     

Gordon stage managed and then directed D'Oyly Carte productions for the next twenty-eight years. He coached new artists on the blocking, dances, and line readings for each part, and maintained strict quality control over the productions. He was named stage director for the company in 1922 and served in that capacity for seventeen years.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, Appendix pp. I–IV&lt;/ref&gt; When ''The Sorcerer'' was revived in 1916 after a long absence from the company's repertory, Gordon directed the production.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, John Malcolm. "Deeside Man Carries On Gilbert Traditions", ''Aberdeen Press and Journal'', 13 December 1937, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; In consultation with Rupert D'Oyly Carte, he was responsible for making major textual revisions to ''Ruddigore'' when it was revived, for the first time, in December 1921. Around the same time, he worked with the company's musical director, [[Harry Norris (conductor)|Harry Norris]], to create the radically shortened "Savoy Edition" of ''[[Cox and Box]]'', and he approved any changes to stage business, such as [[Darrell Fancourt]]'s introduction of the Mikado's famous laugh.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt; His relations with [[Malcolm Sargent]], whom Carte brought in to conduct London seasons in 1926 and 1929–30, were less harmonious. Sargent's brisk tempos upset Gordon, who protested unavailingly that they interfered with the pacing of the stage action. Some senior company members agreed with Gordon, but Carte backed Sargent.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, pp. 142–43&lt;/ref&gt;

Gordon retired in July 1939, but briefly came out of retirement in late 1939 and early 1940 to coach [[Grahame Clifford]], who had taken over at short notice from [[Martyn Green]] as principal comedian.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; He died at his home in Brighton at the age of 87 after a fall in the wartime blackout.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;Gordon, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; His only surviving daughter, Lily, preserved many of his papers with information about the company's productions. His memoirs were edited by his great-niece Elizabeth Benney and published by Pitcairn-Knowles in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
Many members of D'Oyly Carte wrote anecdotes about Gordon's dedication and the value of his instruction. [[Derek Oldham]] described him as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;a tiger for knowing and getting what he wanted! He was only really happy when he was rehearsing. He loved rehearsing. ... He was the everlasting secret joke of the Company ... and there were some funny tales. ... But he had that company on its toes. It is sometimes said that the vintage years of [the company] were from 1919 and the six years following. Well, they were all due to old man Gordon. … Later, as he became older and tired, it showed itself in the fact that he was not so flexible. He became a martinet in tiny little things of "business" and tradition, and would not allow the individuality of the actor to colour a part, as he used to in my time ... making for a dull uniformity. But what a producer when at his best. ... Gordon gave me diction, much solid stage technique, and nursed the passion and sincerity for my job.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Roy (ed).

Viola Wilson, who was a soprano with the company near the end of Gordon's career, wrote this description in her memoir:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He worshipped Gilbert and this was reflected in his own productions. Although a stickler for tradition, he believed first and foremost in building up an intelligent performance. Short and slight, James Gordon kept a small step ladder [to see over the heads of the chorus] near the prompt corner so he could stand on it, peer through his pince-nez spectacles at us and not miss a single movement. He knew the exact spot where we should stand and no one dared be half an inch out of place. From the stage we could see his luminous pen jotting down notes which he later handed to us. Some of these I still have: "You took three steps too close to Strephon during the duet." "Keep your arms steady during song and sing with more feeling" and so on.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Jai Hind''' ({{Lang-hi|जय हिन्द}}) ({{Lang-bn|জয় হিন্দ}}) is a salutation, slogan, and [[battle cry]] most commonly used in [[India]] to indicate [[patriotism]] towards India (also known as [[Etymology of India|Hind]]).

==In popular culture==
A follower of Indian nationalist [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], Ramchandra Moreshwar Karkare, of [[Gwalior|Gwalher]] (Gwalior) Madhya Bharat, wrote a patriotic drama ''Jai Hind'' in March 1947 and published a book in [[Hindi]], with the same title. Later, Karkare became Congress president of Central India Province.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The [[Jai Hind postmark]] was the first commemorative [[postmark]] of Independent India, and was issued on the day of independence, 15 August 1947.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} "जय हिन्द" is also stated on the first, [[List_of_postage_stamps_of_India#1947|Independence series of Indian stamps]].

The phrase is used on [[All India Radio]] at the end of a broadcast.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} It occurs in the patriotic song "[[Aye Mere Watan Ke Logo]]" sung by [[Lata Mangeshkar]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Mamta |title=Filmi &amp; non-filmi songs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=459ay5Ai2l4C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=Jay+Hind&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Jay%20Hind&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|isbn=81-288-0299-2|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] sent a piece of crocheted, cotton lace made from yarn personally spun by himself, with the central motif ''Jai Hind'', to British Royal couple [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] as a wedding gift in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/TheQueenandspecialanniversaries/DiamondAnniversary/60facts.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 10, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008194238/http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/TheQueenandspecialanniversaries/DiamondAnniversary/60facts.aspx |archivedate=October 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jarhead''''' is a 2003 [[Gulf War]] [[memoir]] by author and former [[U.S. Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[Anthony Swofford]]. After leaving military service, the author went on to college and earned a master's degree in Fine Arts at the [[University of Iowa]].

==Plot==
''Jarhead'' recounts Swofford's enlistment and service in the [[United States Marine Corps]] during the [[Persian Gulf War]], in which he served as a [[Scout Sniper]] with the [[STA Sniper (USMC)|Surveillance and Target Acquisition]] (STA) Platoon of [[2nd Battalion, 7th Marines]].

Like most of the troops stationed in the Middle East during the Gulf War, Swofford saw very little actual combat. Swofford's narrative focuses on the physical, mental and emotional struggles of the young Marines.&lt;ref&gt;Kakutani, Michiko (2003-02-19). [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/19/books/books-of-the-times-a-warrior-haunted-by-ghosts-of-battle.html "BOOKS OF THE TIMES; A Warrior Haunted By Ghosts Of Battle."]  ''NYTimes.com''.  The New York Times.  Retrieved 2017-03-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the [[Through_line|through lines]] of his first-person account involves the challenge of balancing the art and science and mind-set of the warrior with one's own basic sense of humanity. Swofford admits to a sense of disappointment, frustration and emptiness that comes in the wake of ultimately being cheated of any real combat experience by a war that, for many American Marines at least, has ended all too quickly after enduring many months of grinding, anticlimactic suspense. And yet there have been the numerous encounters with poignant, eerie tableaux of dead Iraqi soldiers who'd been killed so quickly where they sat so as to appear to have been deliberately posed, like store-display mannequins, in their final moments of life.

== Film adaptations ==
The novel was adapted into a [[Jarhead (film)|2005 feature film]] starring [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Jamie Foxx]], and [[Peter Sarsgaard]]. The [[screenplay]] was written by [[William Broyles Jr.]] and directed by [[Sam Mendes]]. Reviews were generally positive. ''[[Jarhead 2: Field of Fire]]'' is the sequel to the 2005 film, followed by ''[[Jarhead 3: The Siege]]''.

'''KMAC Museum''' is an American art museum that "connects people to Art and Creative Practice".  The museum is a 501c3 organization located in the [[West Main District, Louisville|West Main District]] of [[downtown Louisville|downtown]] [[Louisville, Kentucky]] 

==History==
The museum &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official website|url=https://www.kmacmuseum.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1981 as the Kentucky Art and Craft Foundation to build interest in the state’s craft heritage which quickly led to a one of a kind collection of American Folk Art from the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.kmacmuseum.org/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the organization relocated to its current home, a four-story historic cast iron structure. At that time, the organization changed its name to the Kentucky Museum of Art and Craft, still focusing on contemporary Kentucky artisans. The new building provided more gallery space for exhibitions and educational programs.

In 2016, after closing nearly for a year, the organization completed a $3 million renovation and restoration &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The KMAC Museum is back|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2016/07/01/first-look-the-kmac-museum-is-back-and-its-pretty.html|date=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Main Street building by Christoff: Finio Architects, NY., formally changed the name to KMAC Museum and achieved sponsorship of free daily admission. The museum now offers free programming for 100,000 students, community members and tourists, alike. KMAC Museum is currently enrolled in the American Alliance of Museums accreditation program. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AAM website|url=https://www.aam-us.org/programs/about-museums/museum-facts-data/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is in close proximity to the [[Kentucky Science Center]], the [[Louisville Slugger Museum &amp; Factory]], the [[Frazier History Museum]] and the [[Muhammad Ali Center]], which gives the nickname of the area as "Museum Row".

[[File:Crayola1.jpg|thumb|400px|An assortment of crayon boxes produced by Binney &amp; Smith between 1903 and 1920]]
Since the introduction of [[Crayola#Crayons|Crayola drawing crayons]] by Binney &amp; Smith in 1903, more than two hundred distinctive colors have been produced in a wide variety of assortments.  The table below represents all of the colors found in regular Crayola assortments from 1903 to the present.{{efn|Due to several factors, the values given should only be considered approximations.  The apparent color of any crayon depends on the thickness with which the wax is laid down, the color and brightness of the surface being colored, and other considerations, such as the age and quality of individual crayons.  In addition, crayons are produced using pigments, which are normally described using subtractive colors, with the primary colors of red, yellow, and blue; but electronic displays produce colors using the additive method, combining the primary colors of red, green, and blue.}}  Since the introduction of fluorescent crayons in the 1970s, the standard colors have been complemented by a number of specialty crayon assortments, represented in subsequent tables.

===Fluorescent crayons===
In 1972, Binney &amp; Smith introduced eight Crayola fluorescent crayons, designed to fluoresce under black light.  The following year, they were added to the 72-count box, which had previously contained two of the eight most-used colors, in place of the duplicate crayons.  These crayons remained steady until 1990, when all eight were renamed, and eight more were added, for a total of sixteen fluorescent crayons.  One of the new colors, Hot Magenta, shared a name with one of the original colors, now Razzle Dazzle Rose.  For some reason, two of the original eight fluorescent crayons have the same color as two of the newer crayons.  In 1992, the fluorescent colors were added to the new No. 96 box, becoming part of the standard lineup.  When four new crayons were added to the No. 96 assortment in 2003, four existing colors were discontinued, including two of the fluorescents.  Also beginning in 1993, packs of fluorescent crayons were regularly labeled "neon" or "neons".&lt;ref name="Welter"/&gt;

=== Multicultural ===

In 1992, Crayola released a set of eight ''multicultural'' crayons which "come in an assortment of skin hues that give a child a realistic palette for coloring their world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crayolastore.com/product/crayolareg-large-multicultural-crayons-8-ct |title=Crayola® Large Multicultural Crayons – 8 Ct. |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517121808/http://www.crayolastore.com/product/crayolareg-large-multicultural-crayons-8-ct |archivedate=May 17, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eight colors used came from their standard list of colors (none of these colors are exclusive to this set), and the set was, for the most part, well received, though there has also been some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latinorebels.com/2012/11/17/crayola-doesnt-understand-the-meaning-of-multicultural/ |title=Crayola Doesn’t Understand the Meaning of “Multicultural”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Crayola produced a 16-pack of crayons that released fragrances when used. In 1995, Crayola changed some of the scents because of complaints received from parents that some of the crayons smelled good enough to eat, like the Cherry, Chocolate, &amp; Blueberry scented crayons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/15/garden/after-a-protest-by-parents-crayola-changes-its-recipes.html?n=Top/Reference/Times+Topics/Subjects/C/Children+and+Youth|title=After a Protest by Parents, Crayola Changes Its Recipes|first=Carol|last=Lawson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crayons with food scents were retired in favor of non-food scents. The thirty crayons all consisted of regular Crayola colors.&lt;ref name="Welter"/&gt;

In 2007, Crayola released the set of eight True to Life crayons. Each crayon is extra-long and contained within a plastic casing similar to that of Crayola Twistables crayons. In the table, the background approximates the primary color and the text is in the two supporting colors. The approximate RGB hex values for each are given as well.

=== Extreme Twistables colors ===
[[File:Extcolors.png|thumb|All 8 Crayola Twistable Extreme Crayon Colors]]
In 2009, Crayola released eight crayons in long twistable barrels.  Although the names of these crayons were new, all but one of the colors were borrowed from Crayola's fluorescent crayons.  Atomic Tangerine became "Sizzling Sunset", Blizzard Blue became "Absolute Zero", Hot Magenta became "Winter Sky", Laser Lemon became "Lemon Glacier", Razzle Dazzle Rose became "Fiery Rose", Screamin' Green became "Spring Frost", Vivid Violet became "Frostbite", and Wild Watermelon became "Heat Wave".  Frostbite was the only color not originally part of the fluorescent line.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Welter, ''The Definitive History of the Colors of Crayola'', [http://www.crayoncollecting.com/ccolor39.htm part 39: "Extreme"].&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of entertainers known to have performed in [[blackface]] makeup, whether in an overtly racist or comic "minstrel" role, as satire or historical depiction of such roles, or in a portrayal of a character using racial makeup as a disguise, for whatever reason.

It has an unusual additional fretboard that extends onto the headstock. Most guitarists obtain a Drop D tuning by detuning the low E string a tone down.]]

This '''list of guitar tunings''' supplements the article [[guitar tunings]]. In particular, this list contains more examples of open and regular tunings, which are discussed in the article on guitar tunings. In addition, this list also notes dropped tunings.

==Open==
{{Main article|Open tuning}}

===Major===
[[File:First eight harmonics vertical.png|thumb|Initial eight harmonics on C, namely (C,C,G,C,E,G,B{{music|flat}},C) {{audio|First eight harmonics vertical.mid|Play simultaneously}}]]

Major open-tunings give a [[major chord]] with the open strings.

====Open A====
: E-A-C{{music|sharp}}-E-A-E
* Alternatively: E-A-C{{music|sharp}}-E-A-C{{music|sharp}}
* Alternatively: A-E-A-E-A-C{{music|sharp}} (one step down from "Open B")
* '''[[Slide guitar|"Slide"]]''' Open A: E-A-E-A-C{{music|sharp}}-E (identical to "Open G" tuning but with every string raised one step or two frets) Used by [[Jimmy Page]] on "[[In My Time of Dying]]"" and [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] on "[[Seven Nation Army]]"

====Open B====
: B-F{{music|sharp}}-B-F{{music|sharp}}-B-E{{music|flat}}
* Alternatively: F{{music|sharp}}-B-E{{music|flat}}-F{{music|sharp}}-B-E{{music|flat}}
Used by [[Nickelback]] on "Should've Listened", [[Devin Townsend]] in recent years, and [[Big Wreck]] on "[[Albatross (Big Wreck song)|Albatross]]".

====Open C====
: [[Open C tuning#C-G-C-G-C-E|C-G-C-G-C-E]]

This open&amp;nbsp;C tuning is used by [[William&amp;nbsp;Ackerman]] for his "Townsend&amp;nbsp;Shuffle" and by [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]] for [[The Great Santa Barbara Oil Slick#Track listing|his tribute]] to [[Mississippi&amp;nbsp;John&amp;nbsp;Hurt]]. This tuning is also commonly used by John Butler on his 12 string guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sethares|2009|pp=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tuning is used on most work by [[Devin Townsend]] in his solo work as well as his work with [[Strapping Young Lad]]. When playing on a 7 string guitar, he would have a low G as the lowest string to complete the fifth.

: [[Open C tuning#Repetitive C-E-G-C-E-G|C-E-G-C-E-G]]
The [[English guitar]] used a [[repetitive tuning|repetitive]] open-C tuning that approximated a [[major-thirds tuning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Guitar and Lute Composers|authors=Hannu Annala, Heiki Mätlik|edition=Translated by Katarina Backman|publisher=Mel Bay|year=2007|id={{ISBN|0786658444}} |isbn=9780786658442 |page=30|ref=harv|chapter=Composers for other plucked instruments: Rudolf Straube (1717-1785)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The source says "C major thirds tuning", which seems to be a mistranslation of work by Finnish-named authors, I believe, or it could be an approximation of the truth. There is not C major thirds tuning, but the one I give is the closest.--&gt;

:[[Open C tuning#Overtones C-C-G-C-E-G|C-C-G-C-E-G]]&lt;ref name="Guitar Tunings Database 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=CCGCEG Guitar Tuner|work=CCGCEG: Open&amp;nbsp;C via harmonic overtones|id=|ref=harv|accessdate=20 February 2013|author=Guitar Tunings Database|url=http://www.gtdb.org/tuner/ccgceg/|year=2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310120037/http://www.gtdb.org/tuner/ccgceg/|archivedate=10 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This open-C tuning gives the initial [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] when a C-string is struck.&lt;ref name="Persichetti 1961 23–24"&gt;{{harvtxt|Persichetti|1961|pp=23–24}}: {{cite book |last=Persichetti |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Persichetti|title=Twentieth-century harmony: Creative aspects and practice |year=1961 |publisher=W. W. Norton |location=New York |isbn=0-393-09539-8 |oclc=398434|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The C-C-G-C-E-G tuning uses the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic sequence]] (overtones) of the note C. When an open-note C-string is struck, its [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic sequence]] begins with the notes (C,C,G,C,E,G,B♭,C).&lt;ref name="Guitar Tunings Database 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Persichetti 1961 23–24"/&gt;
This overtone-series tuning was modified by [[Mick Ralphs]], who used a high C rather than the high G for "[[Can't Get Enough (Bad Company song)|Can't Get Enough]]" on ''[[Bad Company (album)|Bad Company]]''. Ralphs said, "It needs the open C to have that ring," and "it never really sounds right in standard tuning".&lt;ref name="Ralphs"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mick Ralphs: The rock 'N' roll fantasy continues|first=Lisa|last=Sharken|date=15 May 2001|accessdate=21 February 2013|ref=harv|url=http://www.vintageguitar.com/2801/mick-ralphs/|journal=Vintage Guitar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Open D====
[[File:Open D tuning.png|thumb|right|Open D tuning.]]
[[File:Guitar Open-D Tuning.ogg|noicon|right|thumb|Open D tuning (listen)]]

: D-A-D-F{{music|sharp}}-A-D

Open-D tuning is used by [[Joni Mitchell]] for her "[[Big Yellow Taxi]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sethares|2009|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nick Drake]] for "Place To Be", [[Alt-J]] for "Interlude 2", and by [[Soko (singer)|Soko]] for "No More Home, No More Love".
Open-D tuning has been called ''Vestapol'' tuning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grossman|1972|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richie Havens]] used Open D tuning to be able to play chords using only his thumb and one or two fingers.

* Alternatively: D-A-D'-A'-D''-D''
This alternative Open D tuning (and its downtuned variations) is frequently used by [[Mark Tremonti]] guitarist for the bands [[Creed (band)|Creed]], [[Alter Bridge]], and Tremonti. It was also used by [[Keith Richards]] on "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]" and the [[Stone Roses]] in "[[Love Spreads]]".{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

: C{{music|sharp}}-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}

Same as Open-D but tuned a half-step down. Used by [[Alice In Chains]] on the songs "[[Over Now]]", "[[Nothin' Song]]", and "Shame in You".

====Open E====
: E-B-E-G#-B-E (''use light gauge strings'' because three strings must be raised) Open E is used by: [[Brian Jones]] on "[[No Expectations]]", "[[I Wanna Be Your Man]]"; [[Keith Richards]] on "[[Salt of the Earth (song)|Salt of the Earth]]", "[[Prodigal Son]]", "[[Gimme Shelter]]", "[[Jigsaw Puzzle]]", "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]", "[[You Can't Always Get What You Want]]" and by Bob Dylan on his 1975 album ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]''.

====Open F====
: F-A-C-F-C-F (requires light gauge strings)

*Alternatively (without light gauge strings): C-F-C-F-A-C
C-F-C-F-A-C is the more common of the two.
Used by
:Elizabeth Cotten on her song "When I Get Home"
:Led Zeppelin on "When the Levee Breaks" and "Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp" (studio)
* '''F-Sharp Tuning''': F{{music|sharp}}-B{{music|flat}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}
* '''Alternative''': C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-A{{music|flat}}-C{{music|sharp}}

:G-G-D-G-B-D
Listing the initial six [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic]]s of the G note, this open-G tuning was used by [[Joni Mitchell]] for "Electricity", "For the Roses", and "Hunter (The Good Samaritan)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jonimitchell.com/music/viewalltranscriptions.cfm?sortby=by%20Tuning | title=List of all Guitar and Piano Transcriptions | publisher=JoniMitchell.com | work=GGDGBD | accessdate=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used by [[Mick&amp;nbsp;Ralphs]] for "Hey Hey" on [[Bad Company (band)|Bad&amp;nbsp;Company]]'s [[Bad Company (album)|debut album]].&lt;ref name="Ralphs"/&gt;

===Minor: Cross-note===
The following open-tunings use a minor third, and give a ''[[minor chord]]'' with open strings. To avoid the relatively cumbersome designation "open D minor", "open C minor", such tunings are sometimes called ''"cross-note tunings"''. The term also expresses the fact that, compared to Major chord open tunings, by fretting the lowered string at the first fret, it is possible to produce a major chord very easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sethares|2001|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-note or open E-minor was used by [[Bukka White]] and [[Skip James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Andy|date=22 March 2005|title=Stefan Grossman- Country Blues Guitar in Open Tunings|journal=[[Sing Out!]]|volume=49|issue=1|pages=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-note tunings include (low to high):

===Modal===
[[File:D modal tuning.png|thumb|right|D modal tuning.]]

In modal tunings, the strings are tuned to form a chord which is not definitively minor or major. These tunings may facilitate very easy chords and unique sounds when the open strings are used as drones. Often these tunings form a [[suspended chord]] on the open strings. A well known user of modal tunings is [[Sonic Youth]].

The triangle is circumscribed by the chromatic circle, which lists the 12 notes of the octave.|For every major-thirds tuning, the consecutive [[open string (music)|open]]-[[open note|note]]s are separated by four [[semitone]]s, and so three strings cover the twelve notes of the octave.]]
{{Main article|Regular tuning}}

===Major seconds===
:C-D-E-F{{music|#}}-G{{music|#}}-A{{music|#}} or C{{music|#}}-D{{music|#}}-F-G-A-B

A compact tuning that fits within one octave and covers the chromatic scale between open strings and the first fret.

===Minor thirds===
:C-D{{music|#}}-F{{music|#}}-A-C-D{{music|#}}

In the minor-thirds tuning, every interval between successive strings is a [[minor third]]. In the minor-thirds tuning beginning with C, the open strings contain the notes (C, D{{music|#}}, F{{music|#}}) of the [[diminished triad|diminished C]] chord.&lt;ref name="Sethares54"&gt;{{harvtxt|Sethares|2001|pp=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the all-fifths and all-fourths tunings are ''[[tritone|augmented-fourth]]'' tunings, which are also called "''diminished-fifths''" or "''tritone''" tunings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Sethares |2001 |loc="The augmented fourths tuning" 60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|All fifths tuning}}
:C-G-D-A-E'-B' or G'-D-A-E'-B-F{{music|#}}'

All-fifths tuning is a tuning in intervals of [[perfect fifth]]s like that of a [[mandolin]], [[cello]] or violin; other names include "perfect fifths" and "fifths".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt |Sethares |2001 |loc="The mandoguitar tuning" 62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a wide range, thus it requires an appropriate range of string gauges. A high ''b''' string is particularly thin and taut, which can be avoided by shifting the scale down by several steps or by a fifth.

====New standard tuning====
{{main article|New Standard Tuning}}
{{see also|Guitar Craft}}
:C-G-D-A-E'-g'

All-fifths tuning has been approximated by the [[New Standard Tuning]] (NST) of [[King Crimson]]'s [[Robert Fripp]]. It has a wider range than standard tuning, and its perfect-fifth intervals facilitate [[quartal and quintal harmony]].

===Ostrich tuning===
:E-E-e-e-e'-e' or C-C-c-c-c'-c'

''[[Ostrich guitar|Ostrich tuning]]'' is a tuning where all strings are tuned to the same note over two or three octaves,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0715563/bio Lou Reed biography] at [[IMDB]]&lt;/ref&gt; creating an intense, [[Chorus effect|chorused]] [[drone (music)|drone]] and interesting fingering potential.

Used by [[Soundgarden]] (E-E-e-e-e'-e') on the song "Mind Riot", and by Lou Reed in the Velvet Underground.

==Dropped==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2012}}
[[File:Drop D tuning.png|thumb|right|Drop D tuning.]]

''Drop tunings'' lower the sixth string, dropping the lowest E string of the standard tuning. Some drop tunings also lower the fifth string (A note in standard tuning). A ''drop&amp;nbsp;one'' tuning lowers the pitch by one full step.

Some of these may require a [[baritone guitar]] due to the string tension required for extremely low notes. Others can be achieved using a [[capo]] and/or a [[partial capo]].

===Examples===

==Shifted==
These tunings are derived by systematic increases or decreases to standard tuning.

===Lowered===
[[File:D tuning.png|thumb|right|D tuning.]]

Derived from standard EADGBE, all the strings are tuned lower by the same interval, thus providing the same chord positions transposed to a lower key. Lower tunings are popular among rock and heavy metal bands. The reason for tuning down below standard pitch is usually either to accommodate a singer's vocal range or to get a deeper/heavier sound.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.betterguitar.com/instruction/rhythm_guitar/tune_down_half_step/tune_down_half_step.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raised===
[[File:Terz tuning for guitar.png|thumb|right|[[Terz guitar|Terz tuning]].]]

From standard EADGBE, all the strings are tuned up by the same interval. String tension will be higher. Typically requires thinner gauge strings, particularly the first string which could be as thin as six thousandths of an inch (about the thickness of a single human hair). A [[capo]] is typically preferred over these tunings, as they do not increase neck strain, etc. The advantage of these tunings is that they allow an extended upper note range versus a capo used with standard tuning which limits the number of notes that can be played; in some cases, instruo B{{music|flat}} or E{{music|flat}} (such as [[saxophone]]s, which were frequently encountered in early rock and roll music) are more easily played when the accompanying guitar plays chords in the higher tuning. If standard gauge strings are used, the result is often a "brighter" or "tighter" sound; this was a common practice for some bluegrass bands in the 1950s, notably Flatt &amp; Scruggs.

*'''F tuning''' - F-A{{music|sharp}}-D{{music|sharp}}-G{{music|sharp}}-C-F / F-B{{music|flat}}-E{{music|flat}}-A{{music|flat}}-C-F&lt;br /&gt;Half a step up from standard tuning. Used in most of [[Johnny Cash]]'s music, for "Love Buzz" on Nirvana's ''Bleach'' album - apparently by mistake (according to Come As You Are - Michael Azerrad), [[3 Doors Down]] on "[[Here Without You]]" (a capo was probably used), [[Vektor (band)|Vektor]], [[Soundgarden]]'s "[[Black Hole Sun]]" (The low E string was tuned to Eb/D# for a drop Eb/D# tuning), [[Nickelback]] on their song "[[When We Stand Together]]", [[Burzum]] on his first 3 albums, John Fedowitz in his solo project "Ceremony", and [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]] on "[[Got the Time]]".
*'''F{{music|sharp}}/G{{music|flat}} tuning''' - F{{music|sharp}}-B-E-A-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}} / G{{music|flat}}-B-E-A-D{{music|flat}}-G{{music|flat}}&lt;br /&gt;One full step up from standard. Primary tuning for the band [[The Chameleons]]. [[Johnny Marr]] also used this tuning extensively with [[The Smiths]]; bassist [[Andy Rourke]] remained in standard, however, even when Marr was playing in F#. British singer-songwriter [[Dave Mason]] also plays in F#.
*'''G tuning''' also known as  '''[[Terz guitar|Terz tuning]]''' (sometimes spelled "Tierce", "Third", or "Tertz", all of which are acceptable) - G-C-F-A{{music|sharp}}-D-G / G-C-F-B{{music|flat}}-D-G&lt;br /&gt;One and one half steps up from standard.

*'''A tuning''' - A-D-G-C-E-A&lt;br /&gt;Two and one half steps up from standard. This is the standard tuning for the [[Lapstick]] travel guitar.
*'''A{{music|sharp}}/B{{music|flat}}''' - A{{music|sharp}}-D{{music|sharp}}-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F-A{{music|sharp}} / B{{music|flat}}-E{{music|flat}}-A{{music|flat}}-D{{music|flat}}-F-B{{music|flat}}&lt;br /&gt;Three full steps up from standard.

===Dad-Gad===
{{main article|DADGAD}}
[[File:Guitar DADGAD Tuning.ogg|noicon|right|thumb|DADGAD tuning (listen)]]
:D-A-d-g-a-d'
DADGAD was developed by Davey Graham in the early 1960s when he was travelling in Morocco, to more easily play along with Oud music  Among the first to use this tuning were the folk-blues guitarists of the 60s like Bert Jansch, John Rebourn, Martin Carthy, and John Martyn. It was many years later in the 1970s that it became established for accompanists of traditional music, predominantly Scottish and Irish. Due to this popularity it is sometimes referred to as "Celtic" tuning, although this is misleading given its origin and it's primary early use in a quite different field of music. Often vocalized as "Dad-Gad", [[DADGAD]] it is now common in [[Celtic music]]. In rock music, has been used in [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]".&lt;ref name="Gordie"/&gt; [[Pierre Bensusan]] is another noted exponent of this tuning. The [[post-metal]] group [[Russian Circles]] also employ this tuning, and also plays it in the form of all the notes becoming a half-step down: D{{music|flat}}-A{{music|flat}}-d{{music|flat}}-g{{music|flat}}-a{{music|flat}}-d{{music|flat}}'. Three down-tuned variations are used by the band [[Sevendust]]: A Drop C variation, or C-G-c-f-g-c'. (used on the song "[[Unraveling (song)|Unraveling]]"), a Drop B variation, or B'-F{{music|sharp}}-B-e-f{{music|sharp}}-b, and a Drop A# variation, or A{{music|sharp}}'-F-A{{music|sharp}}-d{{music|sharp}}-f-a{{music|sharp}}. Neighboring tunings D-A-d-e-a-e' and C-G-c-d-g-a have been used by [[Martin Carthy]]. Also D-A-d-a-a-d', was used by [[Dave Wakeling]] on the [[English Beat]]'s 1983 "[[Save It For Later]]".

===Dad-Dad===
[[File:Guitar DADDAD Tuning.ogg|noicon|right|thumb|DADDAD tuning (listen)]]
:D-A-d-d-a-d'
Nicknamed - "Papa-Papa". DADDAD is common in folk music (Irish, Scottish), and for the execution of a rhythm guitar in "heavy" (alternative music) on 6th on the third string at the same time. To reach the tuning from DADGAD, Open D or Open D Minor, the G string is dropped to D so that the 3rd and 4th strings are tuned to the same pitch. DADDAD tuning is sometimes used on Dobro guitars for rock and blues. Notable users of this tuning include [[Billy McLaughlin]] and [[John Butler (musician)|John Butler]].

===Cello/Standard guitar===
:C-G-d-a-b-e'
Essentially a cello tuning with the deeper four strings in fifths and the two highest strings in standard guitar tuning. Used on numerous [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] songs and by [[Foo Fighters]] on the song "[[Foo Fighters (album)|Weenie Beenie]]"

==="Karnivool" tuning===
:B-F{{music|sharp}}-b-g-b-e'
Hybrid tuning between drop B-tuning and E-standard. Used by the band [[Karnivool]] for many of their songs.

===Mi-composé===
:E-A-d'-g-b-e'
[[Mi-composé]] is a tuning commonly used for rhythm guitar in [[African popular music]] forms such as [[soukous]] and [[makossa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steward|first=Gary|title=Rumba on the River: A History of the Popular Music of the Two Congos|year=2004|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-368-0|pages=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gKEHO1z413EC&amp;pg=PA34}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to the standard guitar tuning, except that the d string is raised an entire octave.  This is accomplished by replacing the d string with an e' string and tuning it to d'.

==="Iris" Tuning===
:B-D-D-D-d-d
Tuning used by [[Johnny Rzeznik]] of the [[Goo Goo Dolls]] on the song [[Iris (Goo Goo Dolls song)|"Iris"]].

===E-A-C#-F#-A-C# ("Sleeping Ute")===
:E-A-C#-F#-A-C#
Tuning used by [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear]] guitarist [[Daniel Rossen]] in "[[Sleeping Ute (song)|Sleeping Ute]]", the opening song of their album ''[[Shields (album)|Shields]]''. Creates an F#m7/E chord when strummed open.

===FGC3===
{{main article|FGC3}}
:F-G-C-E-G#-C
This is a guitar tuning and style of playing on the Classical Guitar that has been developed by Ian Low. It was recently publicized in the form of a series of videos posted onto his [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfWGk6aJrA4&amp;feature=youtu.be YouTube channel] on 14 July 2016. The 6 strings are tuned to F, G, C, E, C# and C using the standard guitar strings EADGBE strings to allow a different style of harmonic playing.

===Microtonal tuning===
{{See also|Microtonal music}}
The open strings of a guitar can be tuned to microtonal intervals, however microtonal scales cannot easily be played on a conventional guitar because the frets only allow for a chromatic scale of twelve equally spaced pitches, each a semitone apart. (Certain microtonal scales, particularly [[quarter tone]]s, can be played on a standard guitar solely by adjusting tunings, but the distance between notes on the scale makes it somewhat impractical.) It is possible to play microtonal scales on a [[fretless guitar]], to convert a fretted guitar into a fretless, or to make a custom neck with a specific microtonal fret spacing.

Guitars can also be refretted to a microtonal scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

To enable an adjustable microtonal tuning, there exist guitars with frets that can be moved across the fingerboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.nl/patents/US4981064 US Patent for individually adjustable frets]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erhanbirol.com/othersites/tolgahan/EN/microtonal_en.html The Adjustable Microtonal Guitar by Tolgahan Çoğulu]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extended techniques such as the [[3rd bridge]] technique, slide guitar and [[prepared guitar]] techniques can be used to produce microtonality without severe modification to the instrument.

=== Guitar tunings inspired by other Instruments ===
In his on-line guide to alternative tunings for six-string guitars, [[William Sethares]] mentions several that are inspired by instruments other than guitars, for example, [[balalaika]] (E-A-D-E-E-A), [[cittern]] C-G-C-G-C-G, and [[Dobro]] G-B-D-G-B-D.

===Five-string===
Five string guitars are common in Brazil, where they are known as [[guitarra baiana]] and are typically tuned in 5ths. Schecter Guitar Research produced a production model 5 string guitar called the Celloblaster in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Schecter Guitar Research (1999) ''Diamond Series.'' Schecter Guitar Research Catalogs. Los Angeles, CA&lt;/ref&gt; A five-string tuning may be necessary in a pinch when a string breaks on a standard six-string (usually the high E) and no replacement is immediately available.

Some basic five-string tunings include:
*'''Standard''' - E-A-d-g-b&lt;br/&gt;The standard tuning, without the top E string attached. Alternative variants are easy from this tuning, but because several chords inherently omit the lowest string, it may leave some chords relatively thin or incomplete with the top string missing (the D chord, for instance, must be fretted 5-4-3-2-3 to include F#, the tone a major third above D).
*'''High C''' - E-A-d-g-c'&lt;br/&gt;Standard tuning with the B tuned a half step higher to C to emulate a 6 string bass guitar, minus the low B. This is an [[all fourths tuning]].
*'''Celloblaster''' or '''Guitello''' - C-G-d-a-e'&lt;br/&gt;An [[all fifths tuning]] as used on [[cello]] or [[mandolin]], extended to five strings. Used by the noise-rock band [[Lightning Bolt (band)|Lightning Bolt]], and by Jeffrey McFarland-Johnson on his ''Bach Cello Suites'' album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://johnsong.com/johnsong/music/guitello |first=Jeffrey |last=McFarland-Johnson |work=johnsong.com |title=GUITELLO |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Baritone''' - E-A-d-f{{music|sharp}}&lt;!--F# is used due to it being more common than Gb, particularly in chords--&gt;-b&lt;br/&gt;In this tuning, the fourth (G) string is lowered a half-step, thus recreating the intervals between the ''top'' five strings, lowered a perfect fourth. Though chords can easily and more fully be played from this tuning, it sometimes results in awkward [[Inverted chord|inversions]], a relatively minor problem if the five-string is played in an ensemble with a bass guitar.
* E-A-c{{music|sharp}}-f{{music|sharp}}-b&lt;br/&gt;Simulates the top four strings, followed by the second-from-bottom string on top, raised a whole step (the F{{music|sharp}} representing both the top and bottom E). It makes playing in the key of A major easier, though chord fingerings have to be altered unless the strings are rearranged to F{{music|sharp}}-B-E-A-C{{music|sharp}}.
*'''Open G tuning''' - G-d-g-b-d'&lt;br/&gt;Some slide/bottleneck guitarists omit the bottom E string when playing in open G to have the root note as the tonic. This tuning is used by [[Keith Richards]].
*'''Open E{{music|b}}5 tuning''' - E{{music|b}}-B{{music|b}}-e{{music|b}}-b{{music|b}}-e{{music|b}}'&lt;br/&gt;This is achieved by removing the fourth (G) string, tuning both Es and the B down a half step, and the A and D strings up a half-step. This creates a five-string [[power chord]].

===Seven-string===
Similar to five-string bass guitar tuning, seven-string tuning allows for the extra string a fourth lower than the original sixth string. This allows for the note range of B standard tuning without transposing E standard guitar chords down two and a half steps down. Baritone 7-string guitars are available which features a longer scale-length allowing it to be tuned to a lower range.
*'''Standard Tuning''' - B'-E-A-d-g-b-e'&lt;br/&gt;This is the Standard seven-string tuning.
* '''Drop A 7-String Tuning''' - A'-E-A-d-g-b-e'&lt;br/&gt;This is the Standard seven-string tuning with low B dropped to A.
*'''Standard Choro Tuning''' - C-E-A-d-g-b-e'&lt;br /&gt;Standard seven-string tuning for Brazilian [[choro]].
*'''Drop D 7-String Tuning''' - B'-D-A-d-g-b-e'&lt;br /&gt;Standard seven-string tuning with the low E dropped to D, which results in a minor 3rd interval between the two lowest strings of B and D. Used by Ed Sloan of [[Crossfade (band)|Crossfade]]. Also used by [[Animals as Leaders]] on the song "CAFO". A flat variation of this tuning is used by [[Periphery(band)|Periphery]] on the song “Racecar”.
*'''Drop D &amp; A 7-String Tuning''' - A'-D-A-d-g-b-e'&lt;br /&gt;Standard seven-string tuning with a Dropped D and A from E and B. Used extensively by [[Dir En Grey]] since the album "[[Dum Spiro Spero (album)|Dum Spiro Spero]]" as well as the song "Obscure" from the album ''Vulgar''. Also used by [[Stam1na]].
*'''Thirds Tuning''' - E-G{{music|sharp}}-c-e-g{{music|sharp}}-c'-e'&lt;br /&gt;Same range as standard six-string. Allows over two full chromatic octaves without changing position, slides or bends.
*'''All Fourths Tuning''' - B'-E-A-d-g-c'-f'&lt;br /&gt;Expands the major third between the second and third strings, extending range a half step higher.
*'''Russian Tuning''' - D-G-B-D-g-b-d&lt;br/&gt;6-string Open G tuning with additional 5th B-string. Was a standard tuning for classic 7-string guitars in Russia in the 19th to 20th centuries.

*'''A{{music|sharp}}/B{{music|flat}} tuning''' - A{{music|sharp}}'-D{{music|sharp}}-G{{music|sharp}}-c{{music|sharp}}-f{{music|sharp}} -a{{music|sharp}}-d{{music|sharp}}' / B{{music|flat}}'-E{{music|flat}}-A{{music|flat}}-d{{music|flat}}-g{{music|flat}} -b{{music|flat}}-e{{music|flat}}'&lt;br /&gt;Half a step down from standard, used by bands such as [[Emmure]], [[TesseracT (band)|TesseracT]] and [[Meshuggah]] in their earlier days, [[Jeff Loomis]] (now formerly of [[Nevermore]]), [[Cannibal Corpse]] mid-career, [[Erra (band)|ERRA]],  [[Hypocrisy (band)|Hypocrisy]] on [[End of Disclosure]], [[Adema]], [[American Head Charge]], [[Sonata Arctica]] in their album [[Unia]], [[Mushroomhead]], [[Korn]] in [[Neidermeyer's Mind]] demo album, [[Revocation (band)|Revocation]], [[Dir En Grey]] since "[[Dum Spiro Spero (album)|Dum Spiro Spero]]," [[After The Burial]] on ''[[Forging a Future Self]]'' album, [[Chad Kroeger]] of [[Nickelback]] on the song "[[This Means War (Nickelback song)|This Means War]]" (Ryan Peake used a six-string), [[Slayer]] (on War Zone and Here Comes the Pain from [[God Hates Us All]]), and [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]] on [[Silence in the Snow]], [[The Sin and the Sentence]], and all live performances of songs previously written on standard tuned seven string guitars. 
*'''A tuning''' - A'-D-G-c-f-a-d'&lt;br /&gt;A full step down from standard. Used by bands such as [[Korn]], [[Paradise Lost (band)|Paradise Lost]], [[Dream Theater]] (on "False Awakening Suite" and "[[Illumination Theory]]" from [[Dream Theater (album)|the self-titled album]]), [[Emmure]], [[Obscura (band)|Obscura]], [[ReVamp]], and [[Fear Factory]] (on most songs from [[Obsolete]] and [[Digimortal (album)|Digimortal]], "Drones" and "Bonescraper" from [[Archetype (Fear Factory album)|Archetype]], "Moment of Impact" from [[Transgression (album)|Transgression]], and most songs on [[Mechanize]], [[The Industrialist]] and [[Genexus]])

*'''F{{music|sharp}}/G{{music|flat}} tuning''' - F{{music|sharp}}'-B'-E-A-d-f{{music|sharp}}-b / G{{music|flat}}'-B'-E-A-d-g{{music|flat}}-b&lt;br /&gt;Two and one half steps down from standard. Used by Danish band [[Mnemic]] in the albums [[Passenger (Mnemic album)|Passenger]], [[Sons of the System]], and [[Mnemesis]]. [[Fear Factory]] also used this tuning for their cover of [[Wiseblood]]'s "0-0 (Where Evil Dwells)", while their all other songs tuned in F{{music|sharp}}/G{{music|flat}} were played with eight-string guitars.
*'''F tuning''' - F'-A{{music|sharp}}'-D{{music|sharp}}-G{{music|sharp}}-c{{music|sharp}}-f-a{{music|sharp}} / F'-B{{music|flat}}'-E{{music|flat}}-A{{music|flat}}-d{{music|flat}}-f-b{{music|flat}}&lt;br /&gt;Three full steps down from standard.

*'''Octave Tuning''' - B"-E'-A'-D-G-B-e&lt;br /&gt;Six full steps (one octave) down from standard tuning.

The open C tuning for 7-string guitar was [[Devin Townsend|Devin Townsend's]] preferred tuning for the extreme metal band [[Strapping Young Lad]] (GCGCGCE).

====Higher====
*'''High A''' - E-A-d-g-b-e'-a' - Standard tuning with a high 'A' instead of a low 'B'. Because of the high pitch of the 'A' string, it usually requires a [[Fret#Variations|multi-scale fingerboard (fanned frets)]] to provide enough tension.
*'''C tuning''' - C-F-A{{music|sharp}}-d{{music|sharp}}-g-c'-f' / C-F-B{{music|flat}}-e{{music|flat}}-g-c'-f'&lt;br /&gt;Half a step up from standard, used by [[Darwin's Waiting Room|Eddie Rendini]] during his time in [[Cold (band)|Cold]].
*'''C{{music|sharp}} tuning''' - C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-B-e-a-c{{music|sharp}}-f{{music|sharp}}&lt;br /&gt; The whole step up from standard. This tuning was used by [[Wes Borland]] with high E-string being lowered to C{{music|sharp}} (C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-B-e-a-c{{music|sharp}}-c{{music|sharp}}) on the first two [[Limp Bizkit]] records.

====Dropped====
These tunings have the added low 7th string tuned one full step lower allowing for chord structures similar to six-string drop tunings.
*'''Drop B''' - B-F{{music|sharp}}-B-E-A-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}} / B-F{{music|sharp}}-B-E-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}} / B-G{{music|flat}}-B-E-A-D{{music|flat}}-G{{music|flat}}&lt;br /&gt; a tuning which combines the standard drop B tuning of a 6 string electric guitar, but with a high F{{music|sharp}} for soloing. Used by bands such as [[All Shall Perish]] and [[Assemble the Chariots]]
*'''Drop A''' - A-E-A-D-G-B-E&lt;br /&gt; A combination of standard 6 string tuning and a 7th string dropped one full step for power chords, used by [[deathcore]] bands such as [[Suicide Silence]], [[Oceano (band)|Oceano]], and [[Whitechapel (band)|Whitechapel]], as well as other bands such as [[Lacuna Coil]], [[Blotted Science]], [[In This Moment]], [[Chimaira]] (on [[Pass Out of Existence]] and [[Crown of Phantoms]]), and occasionally [[Scar Symmetry]], [[Escape the Fate]], [[King 810]], [[The Devil Wears Prada (band)|The Devil Wears Prada]], [[Dry Kill Logic]], Eldest 11, December In Red, A Fall To Break, and [[CFO$]] on some songs. Triumphant Return guitarist Matti varies this tuning by dropping both the low B to A and low E to D and raising the high B and E a half-step to C and F (A-D-A-D-G-C-F).
*'''Drop A''' - alternatively, A-E-A-D-F#-B-E&lt;br /&gt; The same as drop A tuning for a 6-string on the low strings while retaining a high E. In effect converts a 7-string into a drop A baritone guitar, but with standard tuning's soloing capability.
*'''Drop G{{music|sharp}}/Drop A{{music|flat}}''' -G{{music|sharp}}-D{{music|sharp}}-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-A{{music|sharp}}-D{{music|sharp}} / A{{music|flat}}-E{{music|flat}}-A{{music|flat}}-D{{music|flat}}-G{{music|flat}}-B{{music|flat}}-E{{music|flat}}&lt;br /&gt;One half step down from standard Drop A. Used by bands such as [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]] on some songs from [[Silence in the Snow]] and [[The Sin and the Sentence]], [[Destrophy]], [[TesseracT (band)|TesseracT]], [[Brian "Head" Welch]], [[After The Burial]] on some songs from their [[Rareform]], [[In Dreams (After the Burial album)|In Dreams]] and [[Dig Deep (album)|Dig Deep]] albums, [[Within the Ruins]], [[In Hearts Wake]] and [[Periphery (band)|Periphery]]. [[Jim Johnston (composer)|Jim Johnston]] used this tuning for the song "I Bring the Darkness (End of Days)".
*'''Drop G''' - G-D-G-C-F-A-D&lt;br /&gt;A full step from standard Drop A, used by such bands as [[Molotov Solution]], [[Impending Doom (American band)|Impending Doom]], [[Attack Attack!]] on their album [[This Means War (Attack Attack! Album)|This Means War]], [[Any Given Day]], [[Vildhjarta]], [[Whitechapel (band)|Whitechapel]] on some songs, [[Emmure]] and [[Born of Osiris]] since their album [[The Discovery (album)|The Discovery]].
*'''Drop F{{music|sharp}}/Drop G{{music|flat}}''' - F{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-B-E-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}} / G{{music|flat}}-D{{music|flat}}-G{{music|flat}}-B-E-A{{music|flat}}-D{{music|flat}}&lt;br /&gt;One and one half steps down from standard Drop A. Used by [[Deftones]] (on their [[Saturday Night Wrist]] album).
*'''Drop F''' - F-C-F-A{{music|sharp}}-D{{music|sharp}}-G-C / F-C-F-B{{music|flat}}-E{{music|flat}}-G-C / &lt;br /&gt;Two full steps down from standard Drop A. This tuning is used on three tracks on [[Attack Attack!]]'s album ''[[This Means War (Attack Attack! Album)|This Means War]]'': "The Hopeless," "The Abduction," and "The Wretched." The bands [[DVSR]], [[Northlane]], [[The Acacia Strain]], [[Reflections (Minnesota band)|Reflections]] and "Conan" use this tuning as well. Triumphant Return uses a variation of this tuning (F-C-G-C-F-A-D).
*'''Drop E1''' - E-B-E-A-D-F{{music|sharp}}-B / E-B-E-A-D-G{{music|flat}}-B&lt;br /&gt;Two and one half steps down from standard Drop A.
*'''Drop D1{{music|sharp}}/Drop E1{{music|flat}}''' - D{{music|sharp}}-A{{music|sharp}}-D{{music|sharp}}-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F-A{{music|sharp}} / E{{music|flat}}-B{{music|flat}}-E{{music|flat}}-A{{music|flat}}-D{{music|flat}}-F-B{{music|flat}}&lt;br /&gt;Three full steps down from standard Drop A.
*'''Drop D1''' - D-A-D-G-C-E-A&lt;br /&gt;Three and one half steps down from standard Drop A. Used by Black Tongue.
*'''Drop C1{{music|sharp}}/Drop D1{{music|flat}}''' - D{{music|flat}}-A{{music|flat}}-D{{music|flat}}-G{{music|flat}}-B-E{{music|flat}}-A{{music|flat}} / C{{music|sharp}}-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-B-D{{music|sharp}}-G{{music|sharp}}&lt;br /&gt;Four full steps down from standard Drop A.

===Eight-string===
A continuation of the 7-string, adding another string a perfect fourth lower than the seven strings low B. The [[eight-string guitar|eight string guitars]] additional low F{{music|sharp}} string is just a whole step up from a bass guitars low E string. While [[luthiers]] have been building these instruments previously, mass-produced Eight-string electric guitars are a relatively recent innovation. Ibanez was first to offer a production eight-string guitar in March 2007.&lt;ref name="ibn8str"&gt;Official Ibanez Forums announcement: {{cite web |url=http://www.ibanez.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=4151&amp;PN=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070301171917/http://www.ibanez.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=4151&amp;PN=1 |archivedate=2007-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other companies now produce mass-market eight-string models, yet these guitars remain relatively uncommon.

Like Drop E, A; this tuning allows easy fingering on the E since it is a standard fourth interval below the A. It also provides three high strings a fourth apart instead of the usual two. The tuning is used by [[Infant Annihilator]] on their album ''[[The Elysian Grandeval Galèriarch]]''. A 7-string variation of the tuning without the high E (E-A-E-A-D-F{{music|sharp}}-B) was used on their previous album ''The Palpable Leprosy of Pollution'' and is used by [[Enterprise Earth]]/Delusions of Grandeur guitarist Gabe Mangold.

===Steel Guitar===
{{original research|section|date=March 2012}}
On [[table steel guitar]] and [[pedal steel guitar]], the most common tunings are the extended-chord [[C6 tuning]] and [[E9 tuning]], sometimes known as the ''Texas'' and ''Nashville'' tunings respectively. On a multiple-neck instrument, the near neck will normally be some form of C6, and the next closest neck E9.

Necks with 12 or more strings can be used with ''universal'' tunings which combine the features of C6 and E9. On a 12 string pedal steel guitar, all 12 strings are tuned and played individually, not as 6 double courses as on the [[12 string guitar]].

On [[lap steel guitar]] there is often only one six-string neck. C6 tuning is popular for these instruments, as are open G, E6, and [[E7 tuning]].

===Renaissance lute===
{{original research|section|date=March 2012}}

* '''Renaissance [[lute]] tuning:''' E-A-d-f{{music|sharp}}-b-e'

This tuning may also be used with a [[capo]] at the third fret to match the common lute pitch: G-c-f-a-d'-g'. This tuning also matches standard [[vihuela]] tuning and is often employed in classical guitar transcriptions of music written for those instruments, such as, for instance, "La Canción Del Emperador" and "Diferencias Sobre Guardame Las Vacas" by Renaissance composer [[Luis de Narváez]].

The word '''magnificence''' comes from the Latin “magnum facere”, which means to do something great. The Latin word draws on the Greek “megaloprépeia”. This noun conveys the meaning of doing something great which is fitting or seemly to the circumstance. Magnificence is a philosophical, aesthetic and socio-economic notion deeply rooted in Western culture since [[classical antiquity]]. It regards the greatness of actions, courage, excellence, honour, generosity, and splendour of lifestyles of noble purposes.

==Magnificence in Classical Antiquity==

===Plato===
[[Plato]] offered the first philosophical interpretation of the concept of magnificence. He separated ''megalopsychía'' ([[magnanimity]]) from ''megaloprépeia'' (magnificence), which had been synonymous in [[archaic Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;John Cook Wilson. “Μεγαλοπρεπεια and μεγαλοψυχια”, ''Arist. Classical Review'', 4, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Gauthier, ''Magnanimité. L’idéal de la grandeur dans la philosophie païenne et dans la théologie chrétienne''. Bibliothèque thomiste, XXVIII, Paris: Vrin, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnificence is the special quality in Plato's conception of the [[philosopher-king]], as presented in the fifth and sixth books of [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']]. Only those with a philosophical and educational temperament understand the difference between good and evil. The philosopher is magnificent, gracious, the friend of truth, justice, courage and temperance, has an excellent memory, and learns easily (487 a2-8).&lt;ref&gt;Linda Rabieh. Plato and the virtue of courage. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006: 155.&lt;/ref&gt; When perfected by age and education this magnificent being is the type of person to whom the state must be entrusted.

===Herodotus and Xenophon===
The historians [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]] proposed a social and economic interpretation of magnificence. They used the term to describe the donation of private money and property to support public works or communal needs. In [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[History of the Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] societies this was a widespread custom. Affluent citizens holding public positions were expected to use their own money for a wide range of activities which were deemed important by their communities.

In the [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'']], Herodotus gives various examples of magnificence, such as that of [[Polycrates]] (3, 123, 1); the [[Scythian]]s' magnificent festivity of the goddess [[Cybele]] (4, 7, 3); [[Amyntas I of Macedon|Amyntas]]'s invitation to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] to feast and be entertained by him with great generosity and displays of friendship (5, 18); [[Clisthenes]]'s sumptuous treatment of his daughter's suitors when seeking a good marriage for her (6, 128).

Xenophon, in his treatise ''[[Oeconomicus]]'' introduces magnificence within the meaning of wealth and social obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Cozzo, ''Le passioni economiche nella Grecia antica'', Palermo, Sellerio, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the phenomenon of [[evergetism]] (as outlined by [[Paul Veyne]]), affluent citizens are called upon to offer many costly sacrifices such as building all sorts of public works, such as fortifications, war boats, temples, or amphitheatres; supplying an army with all the equipment and provisions it needed; offering entertainment and shows; hosting prominent foreign guests and regaling them with lavish hospitality. Even fellow-citizens must be plied by them with all sorts of nice things. Magnificence is thus connected with liberality, high lifestyles, and wealth. [[Critobulus]], says [[Socrates]] in the dialogue, is called upon to be magnificent in order to live up to his reputation as an affluent citizen. All these deeds give public honour to the wealthy citizens and the entire city. Xenophon extends magnificence to women.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]], “Magnificenza e mondo classico”. ''Ágalma. Rivista di studi culturali e di estetica'', 5: 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Mania, the widow of Zenis, the governor of [[Aeolis]], not only convinced the Persian satrap Pharnabazus to appoint her as the new governess, but excelled in her military, political and economic duties, never lacking in magnificence whenever it was required (''[[Hellenica#Xenophon's Hellenica|Hellenica]]'', III, 10-13).

===Aristotle===
In his ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]'' and ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] offers a philosophical, [[ethical]], and [[aesthetic]] interpretation of magnificence which exerted an extensive influence throughout the following centuries.

In the fourth book of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'', magnificence is described as the ethical virtue linked to money: "it is a fitting expenditure involving largeness of scale" (IV, 2, 1122a 23). However, Aristotle insists that the type of expenditure must be appropriate to the circumstance. Hence, not every type of action requires the same degree of expense. Thus, Aristotle, like Plato, consolidates the separation of the virtues of magnificence and magnanimity. Drawing on Xenophon, however, he dignifies the economic aspect of a great expenditure by turning it into an ethical virtue.

With Aristotle, magnificence also acquires an aesthetic dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah F. Maclaren,  “Magnificenza e mondo classico”. ''Ágalma. Rivista di studi culturali e di estetica'', 5: 2003: 43&lt;/ref&gt; It becomes an art in itself, requiring that one understands what type of expenditure is needed and does so tastefully. A magnificent man knows that the expenditure should be large, but appropriate to who is actually spending, the circumstance, and the object of the expense. The Aristotle scholar [[W. D. Ross]] suggested that in this conception magnificence turns out to be mainly a matter of aesthetic good taste.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross, Aristotle. (1923). New introduction. London: Routledge, 1995, 6th edition: 144&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic role that magnificence acquired with Aristotle exerted a profound influence on [[rhetoric]], the arts, [[architecture]] and [[art criticism]].

===Cicero and Rome===
[[Cicero]] introduced the ethic of magnificence to [[ancient Roman]] and [[Italian people|Italian]] civilization. In his youthful work on rhetoric, ''[[De inventione]]'', he writes that magnificence is "the consideration and management of important and sublime matters with a certain wide seeing and splendid determination of mind" (II, Liv, 163). Thus Cicero fused the Greek and Roman traditions, transforming the Greek view of magnificence into a Roman concept. The Latin word ''magnificentia'' comes from the expression ''magnum facere'', which literally means "to do something great". In Cicero's formulation, it refers to the greatness of the task, the intention to realize it, and the determination to carry it through. Cicero’s seminal interpretation of magnificence influenced [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiæ]]'' over a thousand years later.

===Magnificence in Ancient Rome===
Magnificence took on very Roman characteristics. In ancient Rome, it is a [[Res publica|public]] phenomenon connected to the institutions, political power and the Roman state. The magnificence of the buildings, roads,  public buildings and festivals was under the control of the [[aedile]]s. Furthermore, magnificence has nothing to do with [[wikt:luxury|luxury]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]], “Lusso, spreco, magnificenza”, ''Ágalma. Rivista di studi culturali e di estetica'', 2, 2002: 43-62&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it reflects a system of [[Roman Republic|republican]] values and [[Virtus (virtue)|virtues]] embraced by the traditionalist Roman oligarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Emanuele Narducci, ''Modelli etici e società. Un’idea di Cicerone'', Pisa, Giardini, 1989: 226-265&lt;/ref&gt; When Cicero claims that "the Roman people loathe private luxury (''luxuriam'') but they love public magnificence (''magnificentiam'')" (''Pro Murena'', 76), he is making an explicit reference to a political system which was being undermined by a new generation of politicians. Whereas luxury represented the use of wealth to serve personal satisfaction, magnificence rested on traditional republican values based on respect for an appropriate relationship between private and public life.

===Rhetoric, Demetrius and art criticism===
In classical rhetoric, magnificence is one of the models of the [[Grand style (rhetoric)|grand]] or elevated style. However the most important work on magnificence in the classical world is ''On Style'' (''Perì hermēnēías'') written by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]] probably in the first century B.C. Demetrius gives a technical description of the typical features of the elevated style.&lt;ref&gt;Demetrius. ''On style''. Translated by William Rhys Roberts, 1902&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Thucydides]] and the poet [[Sappho]] are presented as the leading exponents of this style. Demetrius’s treatise did not gain the same success as [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]’s ''[[On the Sublime]]''. Although magnificence and the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] both belong to the grand style, there are significant differences between them. Magnificence insists more on formal correctness and stylistic [[Gravitas|solemnity]]. Whereas the sublime inspires awe, veneration, loss of rationality, ecstasy and [[pathos]], the magnificent aims to impress without causing fear or indignation.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk Schenkeveld,  ''Studies in Demetrius On Style''. Amsterdam: Adolf M. Hakkert: 1964: 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The grand style of magnificence also entered terminological discourse of ancient Greek art criticism. Indeed, the Greeks drew on rhetorical terminology to describe and evaluate sculpture, painting and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome J. Pollitt, ''The Ancient View of Greek Art: Criticism, History and Terminology''. New Haven-London: Yale University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Magnificence is applied to works of art which express grandeur and other lofty features.

According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the grand style of magnificence can be appreciated in works such as the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|statue of Zeus]] by [[Phidias]] and [[Zeuxis]]’s painting of Zeus enthroned.

===Vitruvius and the magnificence of Roman architecture===
In his monumental ''[[De architectura]]'', [[Vitruvius]] analyzed both the artistic-aesthetic and the philosophical-ethical aspects of the concept and enshrined magnificence in [[classical architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]],  “Magnificenza e mondo classico.” Agalma 5 (2003): 113-125&lt;/ref&gt; In the sixth book, Vitruvius argues that the client (public or private) is magnificent, because the beauty of a building depends on its cost (6, 8, 9). The materials employed should be of the best quality and the most beautiful, which means that they are usually the most expensive. Thus, for Vitruvius magnificence is not only a typical artistic and aesthetic feature of architecture, but is also connected to the social and political [[Auctoritas|prestige]] of the client. Architecture becomes the means by which a public or private sponsor of a building can display his [[Dignitas (Roman concept)|honour]].

It is no surprise that ancient Romans granted such importance to public architecture: even the ancient historians and geographers celebrated the Romans’ ability to create buildings that were not only useful, but also beautiful and magnificent. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] states that the three greatest examples of magnificent Roman architecture were the [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], the [[Roman roads|roads]] and the [[Cloaca Maxima|sewage system]] (''Roman Antiquities'' 3, 67, 5). [[Strabo]] (''[[Geographica]]'', V, 3, 8) and [[Livy]] (''[[Ab urbe condita libri|History of Rome]]'', 1, 38, 5-6; 39; 44) celebrate the hygienic functions of the aqueducts and the ''cloacae''. Pliny the Elder provides a moving description of the engineering skills used to rebuild Rome's great sewage system, the  ''Cloaca Maxima'', which is still in use today (''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', 36, 104-105).

==Magnificence in the Middle Ages==

===Thomas Aquinas===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] left one of the most significant [[mediaeval]] interpretations of the concept of magnificence, drawing on the Graeco-Roman tradition and blending it with [[Christian]] precepts. He brings together the pagan idea of human magnificence with the [[Christianity and Judaism|Jewish-Christian]] mentality, according to which mankind should always be reverent towards God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]],  ''La magnificenza e il suo doppio. Il pensiero estetico di Giovanni Battista Piranesi''. Milan: Mimesis 2005: 9-12&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologiae]]'' magnificence is a virtue that belongs to God, which can also be shared by men (''Summa'', IIa IIae q. 134 art. 1). Aquinas adopts Cicero’s definition of magnificence, highlighting how it consists in doing great things. Magnificence belongs to the virtue of fortitude, or courage, because it regards the undertaking of great things and actions, and persevering even when circumstances can make their realization arduous (''Summa'', IIa IIae q. 134 art. 1-4).

===Dante Alighieri===
[[Dante]], drawing on Aquinas, regards magnificence as a divine virtue connected to God’s grandeur and perfection.  Then, following the traditions of Aristotle and Aquinas, Dante classifies magnificence as the fourth virtue "which regulates great expenditures, in administering them and setting limits to their size" (''[[Convivio]]'' IV, XVII, 5).

==Magnificence in Renaissance Italy==&lt;!--Please note that this heading is used as a link on several pages on  Renaissance-related topics--&gt;

With the advent of the [[Renaissance Italy|Renaissance in Italy]], magnificence underwent a deep transformation, drawing on this cultural movement which supported the rebirth of both classical culture and urban centres. The idea of magnificence and its representation had profound implications for Renaissance society in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]], ''La magnificenza e il suo doppio. Il pensiero estetico di Giovanni Battista Piranesi''. Milan: Mimesis, 2005 13-23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnificence as a civic virtue===
Magnificence acquires new vitality within the process of renewal of Italian cities as cultural and political centres. Magnificence thus reflects the transformation of traditional political structures and epitomizes the flourishing of a new type of civic culture based on virtues which diverged from the previous [[feudal]] values. A novel idea of human excellence emerged which was seen as distinct from the medieval aristocratic privileges connected to birth and rank. [[Marsilio Ficino]] in his work ''De virtutibus morabilus'' (1457) claims magnificence is the virtue par excellence, because it expresses God’s greatness. [[Cristoforo Landino]] in ''De vera nobilitate'' (1487) describes magnificence as an aspect of fortitude. The new idea of nobility emphasizes deeds and works realized by men whose behaviour is primarily governed by the cultivation of such virtues, rather than merely by noble blood and aristocratic ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Teresa Liaci, Ed. ''Cristoforo Landino. De vera nobilitate''. Florence: Olschki, 1970: 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnificence and patronage in Renaissance Italy===
By the first half of the 15th century, magnificence had already become a well-known and highly practiced virtue in [[Renaissance]] Italy. It concerned the custom of wealthy citizens spending large sums of money on building projects and to [[patronage]] of architecture and the arts. In Florence, [[Cosimo de' Medici]] (the founder of the [[Medici]] dynasty) was actively involved in practising the virtue of magnificence from the 1430s onwards and many other ruling families and distinguished citizens followed suit all over Italy.&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Fraser Jenkins, “Cosimo de’ Medici’s Patronage of Architecture and the Theory of Magnificence”, ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', 33, 1970: 162-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Howard,  “Preaching Magnificence in Renaissance Florence.” ''Renaissance Quarterly'' 61.2, (2008): 325-369.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lorenzo de’ Medici]] gained the title “magnificent” due to his support to [[Renaissance humanism|humanist scholars]] and artists, establishing one of the most sophisticated courts in Italy. Magnificence regains its ancient splendour also as an aspect of works of architecture and art. The rediscovery of ancient [[rhetoric]] and the pre-eminence given to [[Vitruvius]] throughout the Renaissance influenced not only patrons’ tastes, but also those of the architects and artists who were commissioned to create magnificent masterpieces that would give fame to the both themselves and the entire town. In the ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'', [[Leon Battista Alberti]] draws on both the philosophical and aesthetic concepts of magnificence. Many Italian Renaissance architects and artists applied magnificence both in their artworks and in their writings. Antonio Averlino, known as [[Filarete]], [[Giorgio Vasari]] and [[Andrea Palladio]] extolled the philosophical and aesthetic aspects of magnificence. Magnificence, however, is not only a practice engaged in by distinguished citizens, princes, popes, architects and artists, but is also analyzed by humanist scholars. In [[Naples]], the humanist and poet [[Giovanni Pontano]] wrote a philosophical and ethical treatise ''De magnificentia'' (1498). Magnificence was connected with the employment of wealth on behalf of the [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] kings and aristocracy, and their lifestyles. Pontano’s ''De magnificentia'' and his other philosophical treatises on the use of wealth and the role of the prince probably anticipated the courtier’s ethic and the doctrine of how to behave appropriately, which would find the most mature expression in 16th-century Italian literature thanks to [[Baldassare Castiglione]]’s ''[[Book of the Courtier]]'' (1528) and [[Giovanni Della Casa]]’s ''[[Il Galateo]]'' (1558).

==Magnificence in the eighteenth century==

===Giovanni Battista Piranesi===
During the 18th century Italy had become one of the main destinations of the Grand Tour visitors, who came from Northern Europe to study and admire Italian art and architecture, and also to absorb classical culture. With Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778), magnificence received one of its final interpretations in the Italian cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]],  ''La magnificenza e il suo doppio. Il pensiero estetico di Giovanni Battista Piranesi''. Milan: Mimesis, 2005: 30-45&lt;/ref&gt; Universally known as the etcher of the ''Prisons'' and the ''Views'' of Roman monuments, Piranesi was an eclectic personality, who pursued a wide range of interests. Giovanni Battista Piranesi had a prominent role within the Graeco-Roman debate. In this controversy Piranesi supported the superiority of the architects and designers of the Roman Empire and demonstrated the indigenous roots of Roman culture, arguing that the Romans had been influenced more by the Etruscans than the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;John Wilton-Ely, The Mind and Art of Giovanni Battista Piranesi. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In his polemical treatise ''Della Magnificenza ed Architettura de’ Romani'' (''Concerning the Magnificence and Architecture of the Romans'') (1761) Piranesi draws on the entire heritage of the philosophical, ethical, economic and artistic aspects of the notion. He controversially conceives magnificence as a virtue which was shared by the entire ancient Roman population. Furthermore, he argues that the Romans used the most advanced technical and hydraulic skills, and the finest materials available. They excelled in public buildings and proved they were better at them than the Greeks.

'''''Marid''''' ({{lang-ar|مارد}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|mārid}}'') is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word meaning ''rebellious'', which is sometimes applied to supernatural beings.

==In Arabic sources ==

The word ''mārid'' is an [[Participle|active participle]] of the root ''m-r-d'' (مرد), whose primary meaning is ''recalcitrant, rebellious''. ''Lisān al-`arab'', the encyclopedic dictionary of classical Arabic compiled by [[Ibn Manzur]], reports only forms of this general meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alwaraq.net/Core/AlwaraqSrv/bookpage?book=89&amp;fkey=2&amp;page=5376&amp;option=1 |author=Ibn Manzur |title=Lisan al-`arab (entry for m-r-d) |page=5376}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found as an attribute of evil spirits in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] (aṣ-Ṣāffāt, 37:7), which speaks of a "safeguard against every rebellious devil" (شَيْطَانٍ مَارِدٍ, ''shaitān mārid'').

The [[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic|Wehr-Cowan dictionary]] of modern written Arabic also gives secondary meanings of ''demon'' and ''giant''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |first1=Hans |last1=Wehr |first2=J.M. |last2=Cowan |title=A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic |edition=3rd |location=Ithaca, N.Y. |publisher=Spoken Language Services |page=903}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane's ''[[Arabic-English Lexicon]]'' cites a source where it "''is said to be applied to an evil jinnee of the most powerful class''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/lane/ |title=An Arabic-English Lexicon: Derived from the best and the most copious Eastern sources |first=Edward William |last=Lane |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408021742/http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/lane/ |archivedate=2015-04-08 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this distinction is not universal. For example, in the standard MacNaghten edition of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' one finds the words ''marid'' and ''[[ifrit]]'' used interchangeably (e.g., in ''The Story of the Fisherman'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/aliflailaorbook03unkngoog |title=Alif Laila |editor-first=Sir William Hay |editor-last=Mac Naghten |location=Calcutta |publisher=W. Thacker and Co |year=1839 |volume=1 |page=20 |language=Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mārid is explicitly mentioned in [[Sirat Sayf ibn Dhi-Yazan]]. Accordingly [[Sayf ibn Dhi-Yazan|Sayf]] demands from the marid to lead him to [[Solomon in Islam|Solomon]]s hoard. But following his nature, the demon does the exact oppisite of that he was commanded. Later he learned from [[Khidr]], he must command the opposite of that he desires him to do.&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Nünlist ''Dämonenglaube im Islam Walter'' de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 100 (German) &lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern fantasy genres ==
In Jonathan Stroud's ''[[Bartimaeus Sequence]]'' novel series, marids are the most powerful type of demons summoned by magicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jonathan |last=Stroud |title=The Amulet of Samarkand |series=The Bartimaeus Trilogy, Book&amp;nbsp;1 |publisher=Disney-Hyperion |edition=Reprint |year=2004 |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' tabletop game, [[Marid (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|marids]] are genies from the Elemental Plane of Water.

The '''Melun Diptych''' is a two-panel oil painting by the French court painter [[Jean Fouquet]] (1425–1480) created around 1452. The name of the diptych came from its original home in the [[Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame, Melun|Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame]] in [[Melun]]. The left panel depicts [[Etienne Chevalier]] with his patron saint [[St. Stephen]] and the right panel depicts the Virgin and Christ child surrounded by cherubim. Each wooden panel measures about 93 by 85 centimeters and the two would have been hinged together at the center. The two pieces, originally a diptych, are now separated. The left panel now resides in the [[Berlin State Museums|Staatliche Museen]] in Berlin and the right panel is now located at the [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp]], Belgium. A self-portrait medallion is also associated with the two panels. Measuring 6 centimeters in diameter, it would have adorned the frame, and consists of copper, enamel, and gold. The medallion is now located in the Louvre in Paris, France.

==Description of the left panel==
[[File:Jean Fouquet 006.jpg|right|thumb|left|Left wing of the [[diptych]] depicts [[Étienne Chevalier]] with his patron saint [[St. Stephen]], Berlin]] 
[[File:Fouquet Madonna.jpg|right|thumb|left|''Virgin and Child Surrounded by Angels'', right wing of the diptych, [[Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp]]]] 
[[File:Jean Fouquet - Self-portrait - WGA08041.jpg|right|thumb|left|250px|[[Medallion]] originally on the frame now [[Louvre]]]]
On the left Étienne Chevalier, the treasurer to [[Charles VII of France|King Charles VII]] of France, kneels in a red robe with in his hand in a position of prayer. The king liked to have non-aristocrats such as Chevalier about him because he thought them more reliable than nobles. On his right is Chevalier's patron saint, St. Stephen, in a dark deacon's robes with gold trim. His right arm is draped across Chevalier's shoulder while his left hand holds a book and a jagged rock, his representational attribute as he was stoned to death.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 7:58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men gaze off to the right as if they were looking at the Virgin and child on the other panel. The wall behind the treasurer and his patron saint is inlaid with marble panels and has elaborate white and gold moldings. The tiled floor's neutral colors create a stark contrast with the saturated colors of the men's robes. Identifying Chevalier is an engraving on the wall behind him that says "IER ESTIEN". This lettering has been used to link the painting to Fouquet since he never signed any of his work. It is very similar to lettering used in several miniatures which are attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, The Life of Christ and His Mother, 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of the right panel==
Seated on an elaborate gold throne, the Madonna and the Christ child are depicted in the right panel. The Madonna wears a blue dress, white mantle and a jewel-encrusted crown. On her lap sits the child, who makes a pointing gesture to the left with His left hand at the patron and the saint. The two are surrounded by blue and red cherubim, which greatly contrast with the pale skin of the Virgin and child. Although the figures are modeled realistically, the mood is otherworldly, described by historian Roger Fry as a dreamlike state of sentimentalism.&lt;ref&gt;Fry, "Exhibition of French Primitives," 357.&lt;/ref&gt; The Madonna is depicted here as the Queen of Heaven and is meant to reveal her as between the veil of heaven and earth. She is both human and otherworldly.&lt;ref name="Schaefer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hagen57"&gt;Hagen and Hagen, ''What Great Paintings Say'', 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The unnatural colors have been attributed to represent the heraldic colors of the king, being red, white, and blue.&lt;ref name="hagen56"&gt;Hagen and Hagen, ''What Great Paintings Say'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt;
	The Virgin is believed to be an idealized portrait of [[Agnès Sorel]], mistress of King Charles VII, who died two years earlier. Sorel was considered by many at the time to be "the most beautiful woman in the world" and therefore an obvious choice after which to model the Virgin.&lt;ref name="hagen56" /&gt; As minister of finance to the king, Etienne Chevalier was the executor of her will.&lt;ref&gt;De Winter, "Chevalier, Etienne."&lt;/ref&gt; Her costume and physical attributes have been compared to other representations of Sorel, such as another painting by Fouquet in which her dress is very similar to that in the diptych. It has also been suggested that the woman could be Chevalier's wife, Catherine Bude, over whose tomb the diptych was hung in Notre Dame, Melun.&lt;ref name="Schaefer"&gt;Schaefer, "Fouquet, Jean."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description of the medallion==
The original frame was covered in blue velvet with silver and gold embroidery, antique love knots, and pearls. It also included a self-portrait medallion of Jean Fouquet. Fouquet is shown frontally, his gold image is engraved into the black enamel background and framed by his name. It is believed that he invented this technique. The original position of the diptych high above the tomb would have made it difficult to see the tiny medallion and since the pieces have since been separated, its exact position on the frame is unclear. The medallion was Fouquet's way of signing the diptych. It is traditionally recognized as the oldest self-signed self-portrait and is Fouquet's only signed work.&lt;ref name="Schaefer"/&gt;

== Background==
Much information about Fouquet's life is obscure. The artist was born in 1420 in Tours, France. He traveled to Rome in 1446 for two years as part of a French delegation. Fouquet was employed by Charles VII and Louis XI and was called "peintre du roi" meaning painter to the king. He was called upon to create portraits, manuscript illuminations, altarpieces, ephemeral decorations, and sculptural designs.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Reynolds, "Jean Fouquet, Musée du Louvre", ''Burlington Magazine'' 123, no. 981 (May 1981): 324.&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to have traveled to Florence and Venice where he studied the work of contemporary Italian masters. This influence can be seen in the Melun Diptych as it has been suggested that the background of the left panel is an Italian courtyard in empirical perspective, not unlike [[Jacopo Bellini]]'s method. In contrast to the Madonna and child panel, which lacks perspective completely, the background behind Chevalier and St. Stephen extends deep into space in a truly Italian style. The figures are also clear and modeled realistically in the Italian style as opposed to his native French.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;Richards, "Fouquet, Jean.".&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the right panel, the figures are so smooth they appear to be polished. This effect enhances the otherworldly aspects of this panel, in contrast to the very realistic rendering of the left panel. Etienne Chevalier commissioned the Melun Diptych to hang over his wife's tomb. Chevalier had a close relationship with Fouquet and was his main patron during his time as treasurer to the king.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt; The diptych was hung above Catharine Bude's tomb.&lt;ref name="Richards"/&gt; This has caused controversy over whether a third panel is now lost. Some scholars believe it may have formed part of a triptych of which the third panel would have depicted Chevalier's wife since it was meant to be hung above her tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, ''The Life of Christ and His Mother'', 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This could have tied the two different existing panels into a more cohesive piece. Others believe this is not the case. A report from Denys Godefroy who saw the piece in its original context in 1660, and is therefore the most reputable source available today, does not describe a third panel.&lt;ref name="Schaefer"/&gt;

Until 1775, the diptych remained in the church of Notre Dame in Melun. In need of funds for restoration, the cathedral chapter decided to sell the panels. The right panel was purchased by the mayor of Antwerp and has remained in the city since 1840. The left panel was purchased by [[Clemens Brentano]], a German poet, and joined his collection in 1896.&lt;ref name="hagen57" /&gt; The halves have been reunited twice since their separation, the first time in 1904 when France borrowed the panels from Berlin for an exhibition of French primitives&lt;ref&gt;Haskell, The Ephemeral Museum, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; and the second time in 2017, for the Jean Fouquet exhibition at [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie in Berlin]].

The '''Mogao Caves''', also known as the '''Thousand Buddha Grottoes''' or '''Caves of the Thousand Buddhas''', form a system of 492 temples {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of the center of [[Dunhuang]], an oasis strategically located at a religious and cultural crossroads on the [[Silk Road]], in [[Gansu]] province, China. The caves may also be known as the '''Dunhuang Caves''', however, this term is also used as a collective term to include other Buddhist cave sites in and around the Dunhuang area, such as the [[Western Thousand Buddha Caves]], [[Eastern Thousand Buddha Caves]], [[Yulin Caves]], and [[Five Temple Caves]]. The caves contain some of the finest examples of [[Buddhist art]] spanning a period of 1,000 years.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web

An important cache of documents was discovered in 1900 in the so-called "Library Cave", which had been walled-up in the 11th century. The contents of the library were subsequently dispersed around the world, and the largest collections are now found in Beijing, London, Paris and Berlin, and the [[International Dunhuang Project]] exists to coordinate and collect scholarly work on the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]] and other material. The caves themselves are now a popular tourist destination, with a number open for visiting.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;Makinen, Julie (September 27, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-mogao-grottoes-buddhist-caves-dunhuang-20140928-story.html "Getty Institute helps save China's Mogao Grottoes from tourism's impact"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The caves are commonly referred to in Chinese as the Thousand Buddha Caves ({{zh|c=千佛洞|p=qiānfó dòng}}), a name that some scholars have speculated to have come from the legend of its founding, when a monk Yuezun had a vision of a thousand Buddhas at the site.  This name however may have come from the large number of Buddha figures at the site, or the miniatures figures painted on the walls of these caves as these figures are called "thousand Buddhas" colloquially.{{sfn|Chung|1994|pp=29&amp;ndash;30}} The name Mogao Caves ({{zh|c={{linktext|莫高窟}}|p= Mògāo kū}}) was used in the Tang dynasty, where 'Mogao' refers to an administrative district at the site during the Tang dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&amp;pg=PA242#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places|editors= Trudy Ring, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger|page=242 |publisher=Routledge|date=13 June 1996|isbn= 978-1884964046 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mogao may mean  "peerless" (literally "none higher", where "''mo''" means "none", and "''gao''" means "high");&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/13/dunhuang-caves-artifacts-ancient-history-chinese-civilization-getty-institute-silk-road-los-angeles |title=Artifacts from ancient Chinese cave temples head west for California exhibit |first=Jordan |last=Riefe|date=13 May 2016 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWmmCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cave Temples of Mogao at Dunhuang: Art History on the Silk Road: Second Edition |authors= Roderick Whitfield, Susan Whitfield, Neville Agnew |page=55 |publisher=Getty Publications|edition= 2nd |date=29 September 2015|isbn= 978-1606064450}}&lt;/ref&gt; an alternative reading may be "high in the desert" if "mo" is read as a variant of the Chinese term for "desert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6wmQAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=mogao+desert+high&amp;q=mo+desert+high |title=Frescoes and Fables: Mural Stories from the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang|first=Naomi |last=McPherson |publisher=New World Press|date= 1998|page=14 |isbn=9787800054006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mogao is also used as the name of a modern town that is administered by [[Dunhuang]] city: Mogao Town ({{linktext|莫高|镇}}).&lt;ref name="xzqhdh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xzqh.org/html/show/gs/30392.html |script-title=zh:敦煌市历史沿革 |trans-title=Dunhuang City Historical Development |publisher=XZQH.org |language=Simplified Chinese |date=27 June 2016 |accessdate=27 May 2018 |quote="{{lang|zh-hans|莫高镇}}"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="statsdh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/tjbz/tjyqhdmhcxhfdm/2016/62/09/620982.html |title=2016年统计用区划代码和城乡划分代码：敦煌市 |trans-title=2016 Statistical Area Numbers and Rural-Urban Area Numbers: Duhuang City |language=zh-hans |publisher=[[National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China]] |date=2016 |accessdate=27 May 2018 |quote="{{lang|zh-hans|莫高镇}}"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mogao Caves are also often referred to as the Dunhuang Caves after the nearest city [[Dunhuang]], which means "blazing beacon" as beacons were used  at the frontier outpost to warn of attacks by nomadic tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HDBZDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87 |title=Cave Temples of Dunhuang |isbn=9781606064894 |author1=Agnew |first1=Neville |last2=Reed |first2=Marcia |last3=Ball |first3=Tevvy |date=2016-05-07 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Dunhuang Caves however is also used in a broader sense as a collective term for all the caves found in or around the Dunhuang area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HvIa9sere_8C&amp;pg=PA427#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Eighteen Lectures on Dunhuang |first= Xinjiang |last=Rong |page=427 |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|isbn=9789004252332 |date=2013-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Dunhuang Mogao cave 159.jpg|thumb|left|Details of painting of the meeting of [[Manjusri]] and [[Vimalakirti]]. Cave 159.]]
Dunhuang was established as a frontier garrison outpost by the Han Dynasty [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wudi]] to protect against the [[Xiongnu]] in 111 BC. It also became an important gateway to the West, a centre of commerce along the [[Silk Road]], as well as a meeting place of various people and religions such as [[Buddhism]].

The construction of the Mogao Caves near Dunhuang is generally taken to have begun sometime in the fourth century AD. According to a book written during the reign of Tang [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]], ''Fokan Ji'' ({{lang|zh-hant|佛龕記}}, ''An Account of Buddhist Shrines'') by Li Junxiu ({{lang|zh|李君修}}), a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk named Lè Zūn ({{lang|zh-hant|樂尊}}, which may also be pronounced Yuezun) had a vision of a thousand [[Gautama Buddha|Buddhas]] bathed in golden light at the site in 366 AD, inspiring him to build a cave here.&lt;ref&gt;''Fokan Ji'' {{lang|zh-hant|《佛龕記》}} '''Original text:''' {{lang|zh-hans|莫高窟者厥，秦建元二年，有沙门乐僔，戒行清忠，执心恬静。当杖锡林野，行至此山，忽见金光，状有千佛。□□□□□，造窟一龛。}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The story is also found in other sources, such as in inscriptions on a [[stele]] in cave 332; an earlier date of 353 however was given in another document, ''Shazhou Tujing'' ({{lang|zh-hant|沙州土鏡}}, ''Geography of Shazhou'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Le Huu Phuoc |title=Buddhist Architecture |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Grafikol |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-9844043-0-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later joined by a second monk Faliang ({{lang|zh|法良}}), and the site gradually grew, by the time of the [[Northern Liang]] a small community of monks had formed at the site. The caves initially served only as a place of meditation for hermit monks, but developed to serve the monasteries that sprang up nearby. Members of the ruling family of [[Northern Wei]] and [[Northern Zhou]] constructed many caves here, and it flourished in the short-lived [[Sui Dynasty]]. By the [[Tang Dynasty]], the number of caves had reached over a thousand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Sui and Tang dynasties, Mogao Caves had become a place of worship and pilgrimage for the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dunhuang Sees Great Changes Over the Years |author=Xiuqing Yang |publisher=China Intercontinental Press |year=2007 |isbn=7-5085-0916-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 4th until the 14th century, caves were constructed by monks to serve as shrines with funds from donors. These caves were elaborately painted, the cave paintings and architecture serving as aids to [[meditation]], as visual representations of the quest for enlightenment, as [[mnemonic]] devices, and as teaching tools to inform those illiterate about Buddhist beliefs and stories. The major caves were sponsored by patrons such as important clergy, local ruling elite, foreign dignitaries, as well as Chinese emperors. Other caves may have been funded by merchants, military officers, and other local people such as women's groups.

During the Tang Dynasty, Dunhuang became the main hub of commerce of the Silk Road and a major religious centre. A large number of the caves were constructed at Mogao during this era, including the two large statues of Buddha at the site, the largest one constructed in 695 following an edict a year earlier by Tang Empress [[Wu Zetian]] to build giant statues across the country.&lt;ref name="duanwenjie"&gt;{{cite book  |first= Chung |last=Tan |title=Dunhuang art: through the eyes of Duan Wenjie |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0SdXEVaFTJ0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=daqin&amp;f=false  |isbn=81-7017-313-2 |year=1994 |publisher= Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site escaped the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|persecution of Buddhists]] ordered by [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]] in 845 as it was then under [[Tibetan Empire|Tibetan]] control. As a frontier town, Dunhuang had been occupied at various times by other non-Han Chinese people. After the Tang Dynasty, the site went into a gradual decline, and construction of new caves ceased entirely after the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. By then Islam had conquered much of Central Asia, and the Silk Road declined in importance when trading via sea-routes began to dominate Chinese trade with the outside world. During the Ming Dynasty, the Silk Road was finally officially abandoned, and Dunhuang slowly became depopulated and largely forgotten by the outside world. Most of the Mogao caves were abandoned; the site, however, was still a place of pilgrimage and was used as a place of worship by local people at the beginning of the twentieth century when there was renewed interest in the site.

=== Discovery and revival ===
[[File:Anonymous-Bodhisattva Leading the Way.jpg|thumb|right|Bodhisattva leading a lady [[donor portrait|donor]] towards the Pure Lands. Painting on silk (Library Cave), Late Tang.]]
During late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, Western explorers began to show interest in the ancient Silk Road and the lost cities of Central Asia, and those who passed through Dunhuang noted the murals, sculptures, and artifacts such as the [[Stele of Sulaiman]] at Mogao. The biggest discovery, however, came from a Chinese [[Taoist]] named [[Wang Yuanlu]] who appointed himself guardian of some of these temples around the turn of the century.

Some of the caves had by then been blocked by sand, and Wang set about clearing away the sand and made an attempt at repairing the site. In one such cave, on 25 June 1900, Wang discovered a walled up area behind one side of a corridor leading to a main cave.&lt;ref name="Duan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idp"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Behind the wall was a small cave stuffed with an enormous [[Dunhuang manuscripts|hoard of manuscripts]]. In the next few years, Wang took some manuscripts to show to various officials who expressed varying level of interest, but in 1904 Wang re-sealed the cave following an order by the governor of Gansu.

[[File:Wang Yuanlu.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Abbot [[Wang Yuanlu]], discoverer of the hidden Library Cave]]
Words of Wang's discovery drew the attention of a joint British/Indian group led by the Hungarian-born British archaeologist [[Aurel Stein]] who was on an archaeological expedition in the area in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/VIII-5-B2-9/V-2/page/0283.html.en Aurel Stein, Serindia vol. II] pg. 801-802&lt;/ref&gt;  Stein negotiated with Wang to allow him to remove a significant number of manuscripts as well as the finest paintings and textiles for a fee. He was followed by a French expedition under [[Paul Pelliot]] who acquired many thousands of items in 1908, and then by a Japanese expedition under [[Otani Kozui]] in 1911 and a Russian expedition under [[Sergei F. Oldenburg]] in 1914. A well-known scholar [[Luo Zhenyu]] edited some of the manuscripts Pelliot acquired into a volume which was then published in 1909 as "Manuscripts of the Dunhuang Caves" ({{lang|zh-hant|敦煌石室遺書}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/dunhuang-shi-shi-yi-shu/oclc/52768538 Dunhuang shi shi yi shu]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein and Pelliot provoked much interest in the West about the Dunhuang Caves; however, there was initially little interest in official circles in China. Concerned that the remaining manuscripts might be lost, Luo Zhenyu and others persuaded the Ministry of Education to recover the rest of the manuscripts to be sent to Peking ([[Beijing]]) in 1910. However, not all the remaining manuscripts were taken to Peking, and of those retrieved, some were then stolen. Some of the caves were [[Russians in China#Vandalism of Mogao Caves|damaged and vandalized by White Russian soldiers]] when they were used by the local authority in 1921 to house Russian soldiers fleeing the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] following the [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="杨秀清2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang |first1=Xiuqing (杨秀清) |script-title=zh:风雨敦煌话沧桑: 历经劫难的莫高窟 Feng yu Dunhuang hua cang sang: li jing jie nan de Mogao ku|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtshc7KLLJwC&amp;pg=PT163|year=2006| publisher = [[:zh:五洲传播出版社|China Intercontinental Press]]|isbn=978-7-5085-0916-7|pages=158–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, American explorer [[Langdon Warner]] removed a number of murals as well as a statue from some of the caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Foreign Devils on the Silk Road |author=Peter Hopkirk |authorlink = Peter Hopkirk|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DoxsQDBQHYEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=John Murray |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7195-6448-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/art/209770 |title = From the Harvard Art Museums’ collections Eight Men Ferrying a Statue of the Buddha (from Mogao Cave 323, Dunhuang, Gansu province) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://img.mp.itc.cn/upload/20160413/2e3f23e8bbaf4d3598091e5b13e369c0.jpg |title = Eight Men Ferrying a Statue of the Buddha }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 [[Kuomingtang]] soldiers stationed at Dunhuang caused some damage to the murals and statues at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authors=Whitfield, Roderick, [[Susan Whitfield]], and Neville Agnew|title= Cave Temples of Dunhuang: Art and History on the Silk Road |year=2000|publisher= The British Library |page=37|isbn= 0-7123-4697-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation improved in 1941 when, following a visit by [[Wu Zuoren]] to the site the previous year, the painter [[Zhang Daqian]] arrived at the caves with a small team of assistants and stayed for two and a half years to repair and copy the murals. He exhibited and published the copies of the murals in 1943, which helped to publicize and give much prominence to the art of Dunhuang within China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icm.gov.mo/exhibition/daqian/significanceE.asp The Epochal Significance in Zhang Daqian's Copies of Dunhuang Fresco] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728114420/http://www.icm.gov.mo/exhibition/daqian/significanceE.asp |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Xiang Da then persuaded [[Yu Youren]], a prominent member of the [[Kuomintang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party), to set up an institution, the Research Institute of Dunhuang Art (which later became the [[Dunhuang Research Academy|Dunhuang Academy]]), at Mogao in 1944 to look after the site and its contents. In 1956, the first [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]], [[Zhou Enlai]], took a personal interest in the caves and sanctioned a grant to repair and protect the site; and in 1961, the Mogao Caves were declared to be a specially protected historical monument by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], and large-scale renovation work at Mogao began soon afterwards. The site escaped the widespread damage caused to many religious sites during the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first= Chung |last=Tan |title=Dunhuang art: through the eyes of Duan Wenjie |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0SdXEVaFTJ0C&amp;pg=233#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=223 |isbn=81-7017-313-2 |year=1994 |publisher= Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Library Cave ==

[[File:Dunhuang Cave 16.jpg|thumb|280px|Picture of Cave 16, by Aurel Stein in 1907, with manuscripts piled up beside the entrance to Cave 17, the Library Cave, which is to the right in this picture.]]
The cave no. 17 discovered by [[Wang Yuanlu]] came to be known as the Library Cave. It is sited off the entrance leading to cave no.16, and was originally used as a memorial cave for a local monk Hongbian on his death in 862. Hongbian, from a wealthy Wu family, was responsible for the construction of cave 16, and the Library Cave may have been used as his retreat in his lifetime. The cave originally contained his statue which was moved to another cave when it was used to keep manuscripts, some of which bear Hongbian's seal. A large number of documents dating from 406 to 1002 were found in the cave, heaped up in closely packed layers of bundles of scrolls. In addition to the 1,100 bundles of scrolls, there were also over 15,000 paper books and shorter texts, including a Hebrew penitential prayer (selichah) (see [[Dunhuang manuscripts]]). The Library Cave also contained textiles such as banners, numerous damaged figurines of Buddhas, and other Buddhist paraphernalia. According to Stein who was the first to describe the cave in its original state:&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/VIII-5-B2-8/V-2/page/0246.html.en Opening of the hidden chapel] M. Aurel Stein, ''Ruins of Desert Cathay: Vol II''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Heaped up in layers, but without any order, there appeared in the dim light of the priest's little lamp a solid mass of manuscript bundles rising to a height of nearly ten feet, and filling, as subsequent measurement showed, close on 500 cubic feet. The area left clear within the room was just sufficient for two people to stand in.|Aurel Stein|''Ruins of Desert Cathay: Vol. II''}}
The Library Cave was walled off sometime early in the 11th century. A number of theories have been proposed as the reason for sealing the caves. Stein first proposed that the cave had become a waste repository for venerable, damaged and used manuscripts and hallowed paraphernalia and then sealed perhaps when the place came under threat. Following this interpretation some suggested that the handwritten manuscripts of the [[Tripitaka]] became obsolete when printing became widespread, the older manuscripts were therefore stored away.&lt;ref&gt;Akira, Fujieda, "The Tun-Huan Manuscripts", in ''Essays on the sources for Chinese history'' (1973). edited by Donald D. Leslie, Colin Mackerras, and Wang Gungwu. [[Australian National University]], {{ISBN|0-87249-329-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another suggestion is that the cave was simply used as a book storehouse for documents which accumulated over a century and a half, then sealed up when it became full.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toyo-bunko.or.jp/newresearch/upload/2010011510422259.pdf The Provenance and Character of the Dunhuang Documents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414223151/http://www.toyo-bunko.or.jp/newresearch/upload/2010011510422259.pdf |date=2012-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others, such as Pelliot, suggested an alternative scenario, that the monks hurriedly hid the documents in advance of an attack by invaders, perhaps when [[Western Xia|Xi Xia]] invaded in 1035. This theory was proposed in light of the absence of documents from Xi Xia and the disordered state in which Pelliot found the room (perhaps a misinterpretation because unbeknownst to him the room was disturbed by Stein months before). Another theory posits that the items were from a monastic library and hidden due to threats from Muslims who were moving eastward. This theory proposes that the monks of a nearby monastery heard about the fall of the Buddhist [[kingdom of Khotan]] to [[Kara-Khanid Khanate|Karakhanids]] invaders from [[Kashgar]] in 1006 and the destruction it caused, so they sealed their library to avoid it being destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Rong, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/asie_0766-1177_1999_num_11_1_1155 The Nature of the Dunhuang Library Cave and the Reasons for its Sealing]&lt;/ref&gt;  The latest date recorded in the documents found in the cave is generally accepted to be 1002, and although other dates have been suggested, the cave was likely to have been sealed not long after that date.

===Dunhuang manuscripts===
{{Main|Dunhuang manuscripts}}
[[File:Pelliot cave163.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Paul Pelliot]] examining manuscripts in the Library Cave, 1908]]

The manuscripts from the Library Cave date from fifth century until early eleventh century when it was sealed. Up to 50,000 manuscripts may have been kept there, one of the greatest treasure troves of ancient documents found. While most of them are in Chinese, a large number of documents are in various other languages such as [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]], [[Old Uyghur alphabet|Uigur]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], including the then little-known [[Saka language|Khotanese]]. They may be old hemp paper scrolls in Chinese and many other languages, Tibetan pothis, and paintings on hemp, silk or paper. The subject matter of the great majority of the scrolls is Buddhist in nature, but it also covers a diverse material. Along with the expected Buddhist canonical works are original commentaries, [[apocrypha]]l works, workbooks, books of prayers, [[Confucian]] works, [[Taoist]] works, [[Nestorian Christian]] works, works from the Chinese government, administrative documents, anthologies, glossaries, dictionaries, and calligraphic exercises.

Many of the manuscripts were previously unknown or thought lost, and the manuscripts provide a unique insight into the religious and secular matters of Northern China as well as other Central Asian kingdoms from the early periods up to the Tang and early Song Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Whitfield, Susan |title=The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith. |year=2004  |publisher=British Library, Serindia Publications |isbn=978-1-932476-13-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The manuscripts found in the Library Cave include the earliest dated printed book, the [[Diamond Sutra]] from 868, which was first translated from Sanskrit into Chinese in the fourth century. These scrolls also include manuscripts that ranged from the Nestorian [[Jesus Sutras]] to the [[Dunhuang Go Manual]] and ancient music scores, as well as the image of the [[Chinese astronomy]] [[Dunhuang map]]. These scrolls chronicle the development of Buddhism in China, record the political and cultural life of the time, and provide documentation of mundane secular matters that gives a rare glimpse into the lives of ordinary people of these eras.

The manuscripts were dispersed all over the world in the aftermath of the discovery. Stein's acquisition was split between Britain and India because his expedition was funded by both countries. Stein had the first pick and he was able to collect around 7,000 complete manuscripts and 6,000 fragments for which he paid £130, although these include many duplicate copies of the Diamond and [[Lotus Sutra]]s. Pelliot took almost 10,000 documents for the equivalent of £90, but, unlike Stein, Pelliot was a trained [[Sinology|sinologist]] literate in Chinese, and he was allowed to examine the manuscripts freely, so he was able to pick a better selection of documents than Stein. Pelliot was interested in the more unusual and exotic of the Dunhuang manuscripts, such as those dealing with the administration and financing of the monastery and associated lay men's groups. Many of these manuscripts survived only because they formed a type of [[palimpsest]] whereby papers were reused and Buddhist texts were written on the opposite side of the [[paper]]. Hundreds more of the manuscripts were sold by Wang to Otani Kozui and Sergei Oldenburg. Efforts are now underway to reconstitute the Library Cave manuscripts digitally, and they are now available as part of [[International Dunhuang Project]].

[[File:Mural Avolokitesvara.jpg|thumb|right|Mural of [[Avalokiteśvara]] ([[Guanyin]]), Worshipping Bodhisattvas and Mendicant in cave 57. Figures originally adorned with [[gold leaf]]. Early Tang.]]

The art of Dunhuang covers more than ten major genres, such as [[architecture]], [[stucco]] sculpture, [[Mural|wall paintings]], silk paintings, calligraphy, woodblock printing, embroidery, literature, music and dance, and popular entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, Roderick, [[Susan Whitfield]], and Neville Agnew. "Cave Temples of Dunhuang: Art and History on the Silk Road" (2000). The British Library. {{ISBN|0-7123-4697-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
The caves are examples of [[rock-cut architecture]], but unlike [[Longmen Grottoes]] and [[Yungang Grottoes]], the local rock is a rather soft [[gravel]] conglomerate that is not suitable for either sculpture or elaborate architectural details.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the early caves were developed from earlier Buddhist rock-cut ''[[chaitya]]'' styles seen in places such as the [[Ajanta Caves]] in India, with a square-sectioned central column, with sculpture in niches, representing the [[stupa]] round which worshippers may [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] (''[[parikrama]]'') and gain blessings. Others are hall caves influenced by traditional Chinese and Buddhist temple architecture. These caves may have a truncated pyramidal ceiling sometimes painted to resemble a tent, or they may have a flat or gabled ceiling that imitates traditional buildings. Some of the caves used for meditation are adaptations of the Indian [[vihara]] (monastery) cave plan and contain side-chambers just large enough for one person to sit in.

Many of the caves originally had wooden porches or fore-temples built out from the cliff, but most of these have decayed or been lost in other ways, with only five remaining, the two earliest of which are rare surviving examples of Song dynasty wooden architecture. The most prominent wooden building at the site, first built during the Tang dynasty, houses the Great Buddha and was originally 4 storeys high, but it has been repaired at least 5 times and is no longer the original structure. A storey was added between 874-885, then repaired in the [[Guiyi Circuit|Guiyijun]] period, and two further storeys were added during a restoration in 1898. Two further restorations were carried out in the 20th century, and the building is now a 9-storey structure.&lt;ref name="fan jinshi1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 |page=124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murals===
[[File:Dunhuang General Zhang Yichao army detail.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of mural commemorating the victory of General [[Zhang Yichao]] over the [[Tibetan Empire]]. Cave 156, Late Tang Dynasty.]]
The murals in the caves date from a period of over a thousand years, from the 5th to the 14th century, and many earlier ones were repainted at later points within the period. The murals are extensive, covering an area of {{convert|490,000|ft2|m2|abbr=off}}. The most fully painted caves have paintings all over the walls and ceilings, with geometrical or plant decoration filling the spaces not taken by figurative images, which are above all of the [[Buddha]]. Sculpture is also brightly painted. The murals are valued for the scale and richness of content as well as their artistry. Buddhist subjects are most common, however some have traditional mythical subjects and [[donor portrait|portraits of patrons]]. These murals document the changing styles of Buddhist art in China for nearly a thousand years. The artistry of the murals reached its apogee during the Tang period, and the quality of the work dropped after the tenth century.

Early murals showed a strong Indian and Central Asian influence in the painting techniques used, the composition and style of the paintings as well as costumes worn by the figures, but a distinct Dunhuang style began to emerge during Northern Wei Dynasty.&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{cite book |title=Three Thousands Years of Chinese Paintings |author=Yang Xin, Rihard M. Branhart, Nie Chongzheng, [[James Cahill (art historian)|James Cahill]], Lang Shaojun, Wu Hung. |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-07013-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motifs of Chinese, Central Asian and Indian origin may be found in a single cave, and Chinese elements increased during the Western Wei period.&lt;ref name=press/&gt;

A common motif in many caves is the areas entirely covered by rows of small seated Buddha figures, after which this and other "Thousand Buddhas Caves" are named. These small Buddhas were drawn using [[stencil]]s so that identical figures may be replicated. Flying [[apsara]]s, or celestial beings may be depicted in the ceiling or above the Buddhas, and figures of donors may be shown along the bottom of the walls. The paintings often depict [[jataka tales]] which are stories of the life of Buddha, or [[avadana]] which are parables of the doctrine of [[karma]].

[[File:Dunhuang Mogao mural repainted.jpg|thumb|Early mural revealed after later over-painting had been partly removed. The flesh tones of the figure with its pigments protected from oxidation contrast with the darkened tone of buddhas in later painting seen on the right. Cave 253, Northern Wei.]]

[[Bodhisattvas]] started appearing during the Northern Zhou period, with [[Avalokitesvara]] ([[Guanyin]]), which was originally male but acquired female characteristics later, the most popular. Most caves show [[Mahayana]] and [[Sravakayana]] ([[Theravada]] or [[Hinayana]]) influences, although Mahayana Buddhism became the dominant form during the Sui Dynasty. An innovation of the Sui-Tang period is the visual representation of the sutra &amp;ndash; Mahayana Buddhist teachings transformed into large complete and detailed narrative paintings.&lt;ref name="fanjinshi"/&gt;  One of the central features of Tang art in Mogao is the representation of the paradise of the [[Pure Land]], indicating the increasing popularity of this school of Mahayana Buddhism in the Tang era. The iconography of [[Vajrayana|Tantric Buddhism]], such as the eleven-headed or thousand-armed Avalokitesvara, also started to appear in Mogao wall paintings during the Tang period. It became popular during the Tibetan occupation of Dunhuang and the subsequent periods, especially during the [[Yuan dynasty]].&lt;ref name="duanwenjie"/&gt;

[[File:Dunhuang figures showing shading technique.jpg|thumb|left|Figures showing shading technique, and on the left, the effect of darkening of the paint used in shading which changed the appearance of the figure.]]
While Buddhist art is stylistically distinct from secular art, the style of paintings in the caves often reflects that of contemporary secular painting (insofar as we know of this), especially those depicting secular scenes. Donor figures are generally depicted in secular style, and may include secular events associated with them. For example, scenes depicting General [[Zhang Yichao]], who ruled over Dunhuang in a quasi-autonomous manner during the Late Tang period, include a commemoration of his victory over the Tibetans in 848. The portraits of donors increased in size during the period ruled by the Cao family who succeeded the Zhang family. The Caos formed alliances with the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]]s ([[Uyghur Gansu Kingdom]] and [[Kingdom of Qocho]]) and the Saka [[Kingdom of Khotan]] and their portraits are featured prominently in some of the caves.&lt;ref name="dra"/&gt;

Many of the figures have darkened due to oxidation of the lead-based pigments from exposure to air and light. Many early figures in the murals in Dunhuang also used painting techniques originated from India where shading was applied to achieve a 3-dimensional or [[chiaroscuro]] effect.&lt;ref name="dra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.dha.ac.cn/content.aspx?id=185436748917 |title=The Art of Dunhuang |work=Dunhuang Research Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the darkening of the paint used in shading over time resulted in heavy outlines which is not what the painters had originally intended. This shading technique is unique to Dunhuang in East Asia at this period as such shading on human faces was generally not done in Chinese paintings until much later when there were influences from European paintings. Another difference from traditional Chinese painting is the presence of figures that are semi-nude, occasionally fully nude, as figures are generally fully clothed in Chinese paintings. Many of the murals have been repaired or plastered over and repainted over the centuries, and older murals may be seen where sections of later paintings had been removed.

===Sculptures===
[[File:Great Buddha, Cave 96, Mogao Caves.jpg|thumb|left|The Great Buddha of cave 96]]

There are around 2,400 surviving clay sculptures at Mogao. These were first constructed on a wooden frame, padded with reed, then modelled in clay stucco, and finished with paint. The giant statues however have a stone core. The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] is generally shown as the central statue, often attended by [[boddhisattva]]s, [[Four Heavenly Kings|heavenly kings]], [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s, and apsaras, along with [[yaksha|yaksas]] and other mythical creatures.&lt;ref name="fanjinshi"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Grotta nr 275.JPG|thumb|250px|Figure of [[Maitreya Buddha]] in cave 275 from [[Northern Liang]] (397-439), one of the earliest caves. The crossed ankle figure with a three-disk crown shows influence from [[Kushan]] art.]]

The early figures are relatively simple and mainly of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The Buddhas of Northern Wei may have two attendant Bodhisattvas, and two further disciples were added in Northern Zhou, forming a group of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Figures from the Sui and Tang periods may be present as larger groups of seven or nine, and some showed large-scale [[parinirvana]] scene with groups of mourners. The early sculptures were based on Indian and Central Asian prototypes, with some in the [[Greco-Indian]] style of [[Gandhara]]. Over time the sculptures showed more Chinese elements and became gradually sinicized.

The two giant statues represent [[Maitreya Buddha]]. The earlier and larger one in cave 96, at 35.5 m high, was constructed in 695 under the edicts from Empress Wu Zetian who instructed the constructions of monasteries in 689 and giant statues in 694. The smaller one is 27 m tall and was constructed in 713-41.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 |page=160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The larger northern giant Buddha was damaged in an earthquake and had been repaired and restored multiple times, consequently its clothing, colour and gestures had been changed and only the head retains its original Early Tang appearance. The southern statue however is largely in its original form apart for its right hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger Buddha is housed in a prominent wooden 9-storey structure.&lt;ref name="fan jinshi1"/&gt;
[[File:BeijingNationalArtMuseumofChina7.jpg|thumb|left|Reproduction of the reclining Buddha of the Tibetan period from cave 158. [[National Art Museum of China]], Beijing.]]

One type of caves constructed during the Tibetan era is the Nirvana Cave, which features a large reclining Buddha that covers the entire length of the hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wenjie Duan|title=Dunhuang Art: Through the Eyes of Duan Wenjie|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-313-7|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures of mourners in murals or in sculptural forms are also depicted along the length of the hall behind the Buddha. The Buddha figure in cave 158 measures 15.6 m long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 |pages=170–175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original function of the "Library Cave" was as a shrine commemorating Hong Bian, the 9th-century monk. His portrait statue, unusual here and among all surviving works in China, was removed to another spot when the cave was sealed up in the 11th century, but has been returned now the library has been removed. There is also a stone [[stele]] describing his life, and the wall behind the statue is painted with attendant figure; such blending of painted sculpture and wall paintings into a single composition is very common at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paintings on silk and paper===
Before the discovery in the Library Cave, original paintings on silk and paper from the Tang dynasty, a formative period in Chinese art, were very rare, and most of the surviving examples were copies made in later periods. Over a thousand paintings on silk, banners, and embroideries were found in the Library Cave, none apparently dating before the late 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, p 20&lt;/ref&gt;  The great majority of the paintings are anonymous, but many are of high quality, especially from the Tang. Most are sutra paintings, images of Buddha, and narrative paintings. The paintings show something of the contemporary Chinese style of the capital [[Chang'an]], but many also reflect Indian, Tibetan and Uighur painting styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Caves of Dunhuang |author=Fan Jinshi |publisher=The Dunhuang Academy |year=2010 |page=235 |isbn=978-1-85759-540-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are brush paintings in ink alone, some in just two colours, as well as many in full colour. Most common are single figures, and most paintings were probably donated by an individual, who is often portrayed on a diminutive scale. The donor figures become notably more elaborate in dress by the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 21, and numbers 41 and 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printed images===
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|280px|The Chinese ''Diamond Sūtra'', the oldest known dated [[Woodblock printing|printed]] book in the world, {{IDP|Or.8210/P.2|British Library}}.]]
The Library Cave is equally important as a source of rare early images and texts produced by [[woodblock printing]], including the famous [[Diamond Sutra]], the earliest printed book to survive. Other printed images were made to be hung, often with text below containing prayers and sometimes a dedication by the pious commissioner; at least two prints were commissioned by Cao Yuanzhong, Imperial Commissioner at Dunhuang in 947. Many of the images have colour added by hand to the printed outline. Several sheets contain repeated impressions of the same block with a Buddha image. Possibly these reflect stock for cutting when sold to pilgrims, but inscriptions in some examples show these were also printed out at different times by an individual as a devotion to acquire merit. It is unclear whether such people owned their own blocks, or visited a monastery to have the images printed.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, pp 99-107&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dunhuang Mogao textile embroidery.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of embroidered panel from the Library Cave. A small duck is shown in the middle among the flowers. Tang Dynasty.]]

===Textiles===
The textiles found in the Library Cave include silk banners, altar hangings, wrappings for manuscripts, and monks' apparel ([[Kasaya (clothing)|kāṣāya]]). The monks normally used fabrics consisting of a patchwork of different scraps of cloth as a sign of humility; these therefore provide valuable insights into the various type of silk cloth and embroidery available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The British Museum Book of Chinese Art |author=Jessica Rawson |publisher=British Museum Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-7141-1453-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Silk banners were used to adorn the cliff-face at the caves during festivals, and these are painted and may be embroidered.  [[Window valance|Valances]] used to decorate altars and temples had a horizontal strip at the top, from which hung streamers made from strips of different cloths ending in a V that look like a modern male necktie.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield and Farrer, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caves==
[[File:Dunhuang mural flying apsarasa.jpg|thumb|Flying apsaras, or celestial beings. Caves 285, 538-539 AD, Western Wei Dynasty]]
The caves were cut into the side of a cliff which is close to two kilometers long. At its height, during the [[Tang Dynasty]], there were more than a thousands caves, but over time many of the caves were lost, including the earliest caves. 735 caves currently exist in Mogao; the best-known ones are the 487 caves located in the southern section of the cliff which are places of pilgrimage and worship.   248 caves have also been found to the north which were living quarters, meditation chambers, and burial sites for the monks. The caves at the southern section are decorated, while those at the northern section are mostly plain.

The caves are clustered together according to their era, with new caves from a new dynasty being constructed in different part of the cliff. From the murals, sculptures, and other objects found in the caves, the dates of around five hundred caves have been determined. Following is a list of the caves by era, compiled in the 1980s (more have been identified since):

* [[Sixteen Kingdoms]] (366-439) - 7 caves, the oldest dated to [[Northern Liang]] period.
* [[Northern Wei]] (439-534) and [[Western Wei]] (535-556) - 10 from each phase
* [[Northern Zhou]] (557-580) - 15 caves
* [[Sui Dynasty]] (581-618) - 70 caves
* Early Tang (618- 704) - 44 caves
* High Tang (705-780) - 80 caves
* Middle Tang (781-847) - 44 caves (This era in Dunhuang is also known as the [[Tibetan Empire|Tibetan]] period because Dunhuang was then under Tibetan occupation.)
* Late Tang (848-906) - 60 caves (This and the subsequent periods until the Western Xia period are also known collectively as the [[Guiyi Circuit|Guiyijun]] period (歸義軍, Return to Righteousness Army, 848-1036) when Dunhuang was ruled by the Zhang and Cao families.)
* [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|The Five Dynasty]] (907-960) - 32 caves
* [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1035)- 43 caves
* [[Western Xia]] (1036–1226) - 82 caves
* [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1227–1368) - 10 caves

The source was [[Mite Kremnitz]], ''Rumänische Märchen : Mogarzea und sein Sohn''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/nid/20007890869 Original text in German (zeno.org)]. Due to a typo in the English edition, the source was listed as ''Olümänische Märchen''.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Violet Fairy Book'', [http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/049.htm "Mogarzea and his Son"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

A dying father and mother left the care of their son to a guardian, but the guardian wasted the money, so the son left him.  He found a giant on his way and lay down to sleep beside him; in the morning, he claimed to be his son, born in the night.  That day, he looked after the giant's sheep and in the evening, he asked the giant's tale.  His name was Mogarzea, he was an emperor's son, and he was on his way to Sweet Milk Lake to marry one of the three fairies there when evil elves had stolen his soul.

The boy kept the sheep out of the elves' meadows, but one day, while he played the flute, one strayed over, and others followed.  When he tried to drive them back, elves appeared and he had to play the flute for them to dance.  They let him go at night but insisted he come back the next day.

Next evening, he dropped the flute and stepped on it, and lamented it, telling the elves that it was made from the heart of a cherry tree.  The elves offered another cherry tree.  He chopped the tree, tricked them into putting their fingers in, and pulled the ax out, so that they were trapped.  They told him where to find Mogarzea's soul, and he brought it back to him.  Then he and Mogarzea brought the tree with the elves back to Mogarzea's father's court.

At court, the boy asked Mogarzea how to marry a fairy of Sweet Milk Lake.  Mogarzea told him.  He went to the lake and played the flute.  A fairy appeared and danced.  On the [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] day, he plucked the rose from her hair and did not give it back, however she pled; so she married him at the emperor's court.  But every year they and their children went back to Sweet Milk Lake to bathe.

The '''Monell Chemical Senses Center''' is a non-profit independent scientific institute located at the [[University City Science Center]] research campus in [[Philadelphia]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. Monell conducts and publishes interdisciplinary basic research on [[taste]], [[Olfaction|smell]], and [[chemesthesis]] (chemically mediated skin senses, such as the burn of [[capsaicin]] or the tingle of carbonation). 

==Overview==
Founded in 1968, the center's mission is to advance knowledge of the mechanisms and functions of the chemical senses to benefit human health and well-being. Knowledge gained from Monell’s basic research provides insight and solutions for issues related to public health, national health policy, and quality of life, including studies of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, pediatric health, occupational safety, environmental interactions, and homeland security.

Monell has a scientific staff of more than 50 Ph.D.-level scientists, and provides research opportunities for local high school and undergraduate students. Situated in the academic heart of Philadelphia’s University City Science Center, the center occupies two buildings with a total of {{convert|80000|sqft|m2}}.  The institute is operated as a non-profit organization and receives funding from government grants, primarily from the National Institutes of Health through the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, as well as from foundations and unrestricted corporate sponsorships.

==Leadership==
[[Robert Margolskee]] was appointed in 2014 as the center's third Director.  Dwight Riskey is Board Chair. Many eminent scientists, academicians and business executives have served the center as board members and members of advisory committees.

:''Not to be confused with "[[Paris syndrome|Paris Syndrome]]"''

The '''Paris effect''' is a sensation or feeling that heightens the enjoyment of a taste or smell of a food or beverage based on the circumstances of its consumption. It is named for [[Paris, France]].

==History==
The effect was observed by [[Little Caesars Pizza]] founder Jim Savoy, an organic chemist who owned a [[pizza]] parlor in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]]. After selling the parlor to a group of investors, he became a wine merchant, and — at gatherings with fellow [[oenophile]]s — noticed that multiple wines manifested this phenomenon. When the drinker drank a wine they had previously drank in an exotic locale, that experience {{which|date=July 2016}} always rated higher than the present circumstances.

The '''''Portrait of Daniele Barbaro''''' ({{circa|1565–67}}) is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master [[Paolo Veronese]] in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]].
[[Daniele Barbaro]] was a member of the Venetian aristocracy (see [[Barbaro family]]).  He was an important prelate, humanist and architectural theorist, who commissioned a number of works from Veronese. Veronese had been involved directly with Barbaro and his brother [[Marcantonio Barbaro]], decorating the [[Villa Barbaro]], [[Maser]], which Palladio designed.

Barbaro, who was [[Patriarch of Aquileia]], is dressed as a bishop.  He was also a cardinal and is sitting in the ''audience'' posture (reserved normally for Popes and cardinals).

The book standing up is the ''La Practica della Perspettiva'', Barbaro's treatise on artistic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20130508084244/http://www.zen-it.com/mason/studi/Rituale.htm ''Il Rituale…''] article by Maurizio Nicosia&lt;/ref&gt;  The other volume on the table is Barbaro's "Commentary" on [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De architectura]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-4011 Rijksmuseum] Accessed December 2008 (when this source referred to the painting being in [[London]] on loan from the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).&lt;/ref&gt; which has illustrations by [[Andrea Palladio]].
Barbaro's Commentary on Vitruvius was published in Italian in 1556, but the portrait may be linked to the publication of a second edition in Latin in the 1560s.

==Related works==
===Two portraits reunited===
Barbaro was also portrayed by [[Titian]] around 1545 in two versions in the [[Museo del Prado]] and the [[National Gallery of Canada]].
To commemorate the 500th anniversary of his birth, two portraits of Daniel Barbaro were brought together for a Venice exhibition in 2015, the painting by Titian from the Museo del Prado, and this painting from the Rijksmuseum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cini.it/en/events/portraits-of-daniele-barbaro-by-titian-and-veronese-at-the-palazzo-cini Portraits of Daniele Barbaro by Titian and Veronese at the Palazzo Cini] on [[Palazzo Cini]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a portrait by Veronese in the [[Pitti Palace]], Florence, which has been described as Barbaro dressed as a Venetian aristocrat, but this identification is not certain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1426">'''Prophetic dance''' is a [[ritual dance]] in which the purpose is to obtain a communication from or to [[God]] (gods)  [[spirit]]s in order to receive a favorable response (rain and good harvests, for example). Is also present in modern [[Christian culture]], in which the term is fixed.

==Christian faith==

"Prophetic Dance" and or movements in the church can be classified in two distinct forms.
The first type most commonly used in conjunction with pageantry, presentation and performance primarily. Flags, banners, and processionals which are just a few ways to be used to minister to God. This type of ministry can have profoundly prophetic overtones but is still geared primarily for the benefit of God.
The second avenue in which prophetic dance or movement can be used is whereby the vehicle/person being used becomes the minister to and for the benefit of the people. Believers feel that dancing or any movement inspired by God can and will become His voice at that moment. They further subscribe to the belief that an experienced person not meaning in dance vocabulary but relationally with God can use this medium to heal, deliver and set people free from all types of sickness and disease. The Prophetic arts is described as God using our gifts and talents to reveal His heart.

[[File:Fellows diploma, Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers.jpg|thumb|upright|The fellows diploma of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, produced by member [[George W. Eve]] in 1904.]]
The '''Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers''' ('''RE'''), known until 1991 as the '''Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers''', is an [[art]] institution based in [[London]], [[England]].  The Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers was a society of etchers established in London in 1880 and given a [[Royal Charter]] in 1888. 

==History==
The Society was established as the Society of Painter-Etchers for the promotion of original etching as an art form, inspired by the French group of the same name which existed in [[Paris]].  The first six fellows, all elected on 31 July 1880, were [[Francis Seymour Haden]], [[Heywood Hardy]], [[Hubert von Herkomer]], [[Alphonse Legros]], [[Robert Walker Macbeth]] and [[James Tissot]] ([[James McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] had a row with his brother-in-law, Haden, and would not join). It achieved its [[Royal Charter]] in 1888, becoming the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers. Fellow, [[George W. Eve]], designed a new diploma in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Viner, George H. (1916) [https://openlibrary.org/books/OL6596361M/A_descriptive_catalogue_of_the_bookplates_designed_and_etched_by_George_W._Eve_R.E. ''A descriptive catalogue of the bookplates designed and etched by George W. Eve, R.E.''] Kansas City: The American Bookplate Society, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1911, when King George V granted a Charter of Incorporation and Bye-laws, the RE, as it came to be styled, had grown in prestige and become fully established. From 1919, in token of solidarity, Presidents of the [[Royal Academy]] have always been elected Honorary Fellows of the RE.

The Society of Painter-Etchers had remarkably few Presidents.  They were: Sir Francis Seymour Haden (1880–1910), [[Francis Job Short|Sir Francis Job Short]] (1910–1938), [[Malcolm Osborne]] (1938–1962), [[Robert Austin (artist)|Robert Austin]] (1962–1970), [[Paul Drury]] (1970–1975), [[Harry Eccleston]] (1975–1989), and [[Joseph Winkelman]] (1989–1991), when the Society was renamed. Winkelman continued as President until 1995. Presidents after this were [[David Carpanini]] (1995–2003), [[Anita Klein]] (2003–2006), [[Hilary Paynter]] (2006&amp;ndash;11), [[Dr Bren Unwin]] (2011&amp;ndash;13) and [[Mychael Barratt]] (2013&amp;ndash;).

==Membership==
In 1920 the membership was expanded to allow artists who produced prints from media other than metal, which allowed the election of woodcut artists such as [[Gwen Raverat]].  Another innovation in the same year was the formation of a [[Print Collectors' Club]] to be limited to 300 members each of whom received an annual presentation print.

Full fellows are entitled to use the post-nominals RE. Associates, a class of members established in 1887, can use ARE.  

Notable members (and their date of election to a full fellowship) included: [[Mary Nimmo Moran]] (1881&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uwe.ac.uk/sca/research/cfpr/dissemination/archives/pdf_archives/PP1880-1909reduced.pdf|title=Goose Pond|last=Moran|first=Mary Nimmo|date=May 31, 2012|website=Center for Fine Print Research|publisher=University of the West of England, Bristol|access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[William Strang]] (1881), [[Joseph Pennell]] (1882), [[Auguste Rodin]] (1882), [[Charles William Sherborn]] (1884), [[Herbert Dicksee]] (1885), [[Walter Sickert]] (1887), [[David Young Cameron|Sir David Young Cameron]] (1895), [[Margaret Kemp-Welch]] (1901), [[Frank Brangwyn|Sir Frank Brangwyn]] (1903), [[Anna Airy]] (1908), [[Eugène Béjot]] (1908), [[Ernest Stephen Lumsden]] (1915), [[William Walcot]] (1920), [[Edmund Blampied]] (1921), [[Gerald Brockhurst]] (1921), [[Robert Austin (artist)|Robert Austin]] (1927), [[Laura Knight|Dame Laura Knight]] (1932), [[William Russell Flint|Sir William Russell Flint]] (1933), [[Charles Tunnicliffe]] (1934), [[Geoffrey Wedgwood]] (1934), [[Joan Hassall]] (1948) [[James T.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4634">In [[structural anthropology]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], a French [[anthropologist]], makes the claim that "myth is language". Through approaching [[mythology]] as language, Lévi-Strauss suggests that it can be approached the same way as language can be approached by the same structuralist methods used to address language. Thus, Lévi-Strauss offers a '''structuralist theory of mythology''';&lt;ref&gt;[[Markus Gabriel]], [[Slavoj Žižek]], ''Mythology, Madness, and Laughter: Subjectivity in German Idealism'', Continuum, 2009, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; he clarifies, "Myth is language, functioning on an especially high level where meaning succeeds practically at 'taking off' from the linguistic ground on which it keeps rolling."&lt;ref&gt;''Structural Anthropology'', p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
Lévi-Strauss breaks down his argument into three main parts. Meaning is not isolated within the specific fundamental parts of the myth, but rather within the composition of these parts. Although myth and language are of similar categories, language functions differently in myth. Finally, language in myth exhibits more complex functions than in any other linguistic expression. From these suggestions, he draws the conclusion that myth can be broken down into constituent units, and these units are different from the constituents of language. Finally, unlike the constituents of language, the constituents of a myth, which he labels “mythemes,” function as "bundles of relations."&lt;ref&gt;''Structural Anthropology'', p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; 

This approach is a break from the “symbolists”, such as [[Carl Jung]], who dedicate themselves to find meaning solely within the constituents rather than their relations.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Hanéff, ''Claude Lévi-Strauss, p. 160''&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Lévi-Strauss uses the example of the Oedipus myth and breaks it down to its component parts:

Reading it in sequence from left to right, top to bottom, the myth is categorized sequentially and by similarities. Through analyzing the commonalities between the “mythemes” of the [[Oedipus]] story, understandings can be wrought from its categories. 

Thus, a structural approach towards myths is to address all of these constituents. Furthermore, a structural approach should account for all versions of a myth, as all versions are relevant to the function of the myth as a whole. This leads to what Lévi-Strauss calls a spiral growth of the myth which is continuous while the structure itself is not. The growth of the myth only ends when the 
“intellectual impulse which has produced it is exhausted.”&lt;ref&gt;''Structural Anthropology'', p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; 

== From mythology to literary criticism ==

Myths are primarily acknowledged as oral traditions, while literature is in the form of written text. Still, anthropologists and [[literary critics]] would both acknowledge the links between myths and relatively more contemporary literature. Therefore, many literary critics take the same Lévi-Straussian structuralist, as it is coined, approach to literature. This approach is, again, similar to [[Symbolist]] critics’ approach to literature. There is a search for the lowest constituent of the story. But as with the myth, Lévi-Straussian structuralism then analyzes the relations between these constituent parts in order to compare even greater relations between versions of stories as well as among stories themselves.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Boon, ''From Symbolism to Structuralism. p. 6-12.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Furthermore, Lévi-Strauss suggests that the structural approach and mental processes dedicated towards analyzing the myth are similar in nature to those in science. This connection between myth and science is further elaborated in his books, “Myth and Meaning” and "The Savage Mind". He suggests that the foundation of structuralism is based upon an innate understanding of the scientific process, which seeks to break down complex phenomena into its component parts and then analyze the relations between them. The structuralist approach to myth is precisely the same method, and as a method this can be readily applied to literature.&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Meaning p.5-14''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6960">The '''Symphony in B minor "Polonia"''', Op. 24, was written by [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] between 1903 and 1908, and first publicly performed in 1909. Although he lived for another 32 years, the symphony was virtually Paderewski's last composition; he wrote only one more work before his death in 1941 - a hymn for male chorus in 1917. Around 1910, he commenced what would become a political career, culminating in becoming the first Prime Minister of independent Poland and signing the [[Treaty of Versailles]] on behalf of his nation in 1919. He later returned to the concert platform as a virtuoso pianist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/polish_music/composer/paderewski.html Polish Music Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826072003/http://www.usc.edu/dept/polish_music/composer/paderewski.html |date=2012-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paderewski started sketching the Symphony in B minor in his home near [[Morges]] in [[Switzerland]] in 1903. The work was completed in 1908 and was given a private performance in [[Lausanne]] on 26 December 1908.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; Its public premiere was with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] under the German conductor [[Max Fiedler]],&lt;ref&gt;One source, IMSLP, says the conductor was [[Serge Koussevitzky]], but this seems to be an error.&lt;/ref&gt; on 12 February 1909. It was soon performed in Paris under [[André Messager]], and in London under [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]].&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; The symphony had its Polish premiere in January 1911, where it was presented to celebrate the centenary of the birth of [[Frédéric Chopin]], conducted by Paderewski's devoted friend [[Henryk Opieński]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]], 5th ed, 1954, Vol. VI, p. 482, Paderewski, Ignacy (Jan)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; It also had performances in Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paderewskifest.com/about_paderewski.html paderewskifest.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219072546/http://www.paderewskifest.com/about_paderewski.html |date=2012-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has had little concert exposure since that time. To mark the 70th anniversary of the composer's death, it was performed in June 2011 at the Polish Presidential Palace under the patronage of [[President of Poland|President]] [[Bronisław Komorowski]], by [[Sinfonia Varsovia]] under [[Jerzy Maksymiuk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.pl/1/11/Artykul/46745,Poland-marks-Paderewski-70-year-death-anniversary thenews.pl, 29 June 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; (Maksymiuk made the first Western un-cut recording of the work in 1998.)

"Polonia" is in three movements, although Paderewski originally planned a four-movement work, which would have included a [[scherzo]].&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; As it is, the three movements he did write take about 75 minutes to perform, which extraordinary length has often caused it (particularly the finale) to be cut in performance and recording.

The three movements are:
* ''Adagio maestoso - Allegro vivace'' (30')
* ''Andante con moto'' (17')
* ''Vivace'' (27').

It is often described as a [[Program music|programme symphony]], the three movements depicting:
* the glorious days of Poland of the past
* Poland of the present day (1907), at the nadir of political subjugation
* the approach of a happier future for Poland.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

The inspiration for the title "Polonia" seems to be a series of eight ‘cartoons’ published under that title in 1863 by [[Artur Grottger]], depicting the grim realities of everyday life and struggle under Russian occupation. Grottger's "Polonia" was a response to the failed insurrection of 1863-65 known as the [[January Uprising]].&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;[http://www.adrianthomasmusic.com/about/CD_IJP_HYP_98.html adrianthomasmusic.com]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paderewski initially intended to dedicate the work to the 40th anniversary of that event,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2003/dec03/Paderewski_Polonia.htm Music Web International]&lt;/ref&gt; in which his own father was caught up and even arrested, but no such dedication appears in the score.

The music is expansive and discursive, not sticking closely to any pre-determined form. This quality has attracted comment that Paderewski seems to often lose his way, and also overdevelops his themes.

It is lush and romantic in texture, leading to comparisons with the music of [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]],&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/july99/polonia.htm Music Web International]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]], [[Alexander Glazunov|Glazunov]], [[Mily Balakirev|Balakirev]], [[Nikolai Myaskovsky|Myaskovsky]], [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold|Korngold]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2003/dec03/Paderewski_Polonia.htm Music Web International]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reinhold Glière|Glière]],&lt;ref name=amaz1/&gt; [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Richard Strauss]], and even a precursor of [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]].&lt;ref name=amaz1&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Paderewski-Symphony-Maksymiuk-Ignace-Jan/product-reviews/B00000G3ZC/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending Amazon]&lt;/ref&gt;

The score very unusually calls for three [[sarrusophone]]s, a [[tambour de Basque]], a [[thunder sheet]] and an [[Organ (music)|organ]]. The full instrumentation is: piccolo, 3 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets in A, bass clarinet in A, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns in F, 4 trumpets in F, 3 trombones, tuba, 3 contrabass sarrusophones in E{{flat}}, timpani, percussion (triangle, cymbals, tambourine, bass drum, tambour de Basque, tam-tam, glockenspiel, bells, thunder sheet), harp, organ and strings.&lt;ref name=IMSLP&gt;[http://imslp.org/wiki/Symphony,_Op.24_(Paderewski,_Ignacy_Jan) IMSLP]&lt;/ref&gt;

The finale contains a disguised [[musical quotation|quotation]] of the Polish [[national anthem]], ''[[Poland Is Not Yet Lost|Jeszcze Polska nie zginęła]]'' (''Poland Is Not Yet Lost''), in [[duple meter]] rather than the original's triple-time [[mazurka]] rhythm.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;

In 1915, [[Edward Elgar]] wrote an orchestral piece titled ''[[Polonia (Elgar)|Polonia]]'', Op. 76, which he dedicated to Paderewski.

The work was commissioned by the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] and [[Carnegie Hall]].  The world premiere was given by the Berlin Philharmonic under the direction of [[Simon Rattle]] at the [[Berliner Philharmonie]] on February 21, 2007.

==Composition==
''Tevot'' has is composed in one continuous [[Movement (music)|movement]] and has a duration of roughly 22 minutes.

===Background===
The title of the piece comes from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for "bars of music."  In the score program note, Adès added, "Also, in the Bible, (tey-VA) is the [[Noah's Ark|ark]] of [[Noah]], and the cradle in which the baby [[Moses]] is carried on the river."&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;  The composer further described the meaning in an interview with Tom Service of ''[[The Guardian]]'', remarking, "I liked the idea that the bars of the music were carrying the notes as a sort of family through the piece. And they do, because without bars, you'd have musical chaos. But I was thinking about the ark, the vessel, in the piece as the earth. The earth would be a spaceship, a ship that carries us - and several other species! - through the chaos of space in safety. It sounds a bit colossal, but it's the idea of the ship of the world."  He continued, "I thought of the piece as one huge journey, but in order to make that journey truthful, to give it movement, there had to be many quite sudden and instant changes of landscape."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |last=Service |first=Tom |title=An empire ablaze |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 February 2007 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/feb/26/classicalmusicandopera.tomservice |accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adès also recalled a sense of urgency writing the piece, saying, "I couldn't sleep at night. I would feel that I would absolutely die if I didn't succeed in bringing the piece to harbour. It would have been a frightening feeling not to do that. It's more than a need - it feels essential. It's like transporting a person through the air, and you have to make sure they land in one piece."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra comprising five [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (3rd, 4th, &amp; 5th doubling [[piccolo]]s; 3rd doubling [[bass flute]]), five [[oboe]]s (4th doubling [[Cor anglais|English horn]]; 5th doubling [[bass oboe]]), five [[clarinet]]s (2nd doubling [[E-flat clarinet]]; 4th doubling E-flat and A clarinets; 5th doubling [[contrabass clarinet]]), four [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], eight [[French horn|horns]], five [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, two [[tuba]]s, [[timpani]], two percussionists, [[Pedal harp|harp]], [[piano]] (doubling [[celesta]]), and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
''Tevot'' has been praised by music critics.  [[Tom Service]] wrote, "Of any piece of new music I've heard at its premiere, this is one of the most immediately, richly powerful."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;  Reviewing the United States premiere, [[Anthony Tommasini]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' opined, "In this arresting performance ''Tevot'' announced itself as an instantly essential new work."  Tommasini further wrote:{{quote|It begins with eerily skittish high figurations in the strings that sound at once ominous and angelic. Moaning swells emerge from the lower orchestra, and the music builds in intensity and complexity until, in an attempt to break free, a volley of 12-tone-like riffs wildly erupts, clearing away the angst. The piece segues into its most rhythmically agitated and harmonically gnashing episode.

Then a passage of consoling music with sighing lyrical fragments begins, and you are sure the calming coda to the piece has arrived. Not so. Mr. Adès prolongs this episode for roughly half of the work's nearly 25-minute length. He keeps coming up with new variants of layered harmony, instrumental sonorities and supple rhythmic figures that keep you hooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tommasini |first=Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Tommasini |title=Simon Rattle's Berliners Bring Mahler and More |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 16, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/arts/music/16ratt.html |accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Richard Whitehouse of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' called ''Tevot'' "an eventful 22 minutes" and wrote, "From a shimmering opening that erupts in energetic exchanges, it builds a momentum underpinned by the antagonism between tuned anvils and an oboe-led chorale. Reaching an expressive plateau, the piece recalls its start via a descent that gives the stratospheric violin-writing a definite harmonic context, before the climactic final section attempts more overt tonal closure."&lt;ref name="Gramophone"&gt;{{cite web |last=Whitehouse |first=Richard |title=Ades Tevot; Violin Concerto |work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] |date=April 2010 |url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/ades-tevot-violin-concerto |accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mark Swed of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' observed, "Like ''[[America: A Prophecy|America]]'', this journey begins with another weird swirl -- this one, though, more music of the spheres. After a section of vigorous, brash dance music, ''Tevot'' settles down into long, calming, [[Gustav Mahler|Mahlerian]] peace seeking, awed slow music of haunting beauty."  He added, "Ades doesn't hold back in his music. When it's raw, it's raw. When it's cooked, it gets four stars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Swed |first=Mark |title=Ades, for mature audiences only |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=November 17, 2008 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/17/entertainment/et-phil17 |accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Ivan Hewett of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was critical of the work, writing, "I was staggered and appalled at the piece's unstoppable energy, as pitiless as a lava flow, and waited for the high, still chorale on violins at the piece's core, hoping this time I would be moved by it. But it seemed ice-cold as ever, and the grandeur of the ending a mite Hollywood-ish. This is a piece that's either hot or cold, but never warm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hewett |first=Ivan |title=London Sinfonietta/CBSO, Aldeburgh Festival, review |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=22 June 2014 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalconcertreviews/10917712/City-of-Birmingham-Symphony-Orchestra-Aldeburgh-Festival-review.html |accessdate=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==
A recording of ''Tevot'' performed by Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic was released through [[EMI Classics]] on March 23, 2010.  The disk also features Adès's [[Violin Concerto (Adès)|Violin Concerto]], among other of the composer's works.&lt;ref name="Gramophone" /&gt;

'''''The Simple Art of Murder''''' is [[hard-boiled]] [[detective fiction]] author [[Raymond Chandler]]'s critical [[essay]], a magazine article, and his collection of [[short story|short stories]]. The essay was first published in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' in December 1944. The magazine article appeared in the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review of Literature]]'', April 15, 1950. The article, somewhat rewritten, served to introduce the collection ''The Simple Art of Murder'', 1950  ([[Houghton Mifflin]] Co.), which contained eight of Chandler's early stories pre-dating his first novel, ''[[The Big Sleep]]''.

The essay is considered a seminal piece of [[literary criticism]].  Although Chandler's primary topic is the art (and failings) of detective fiction, he touches on general [[literature]] and [[modernity |modern society]] as well.

The opening statement &amp;ndash; "Fiction in any form has always intended to be realistic" &amp;ndash; places Chandler in a lineage with earlier American [[realism (arts) | Realists]], in particular [[Mark Twain]] and his critique of [[James Fenimore Cooper]], "[[Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses]]".  Chandler dissects [[A. A. Milne]]'s ''[[The Red House Mystery]]'' much as Twain tears apart Cooper's ''[[Leatherstocking Tales |The Deerslayer]]'', namely by revealing what is ignored, brushed over, and unrealistic.  "If the situation is false," Chandler writes, "you cannot even accept it as a light novel, for there is no story for the light novel to be about."  He expands his criticism to the bulk of detective fiction, especially of the English variety which he complains is preoccupied with "hand-wrought [[duelling pistol |dueling pistol]]s, [[curare]] and [[tropical fish]]."  In addition to Milne, Chandler confronts [[Agatha Christie |Dame Agatha Christie]], [[Dorothy Sayers]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[E. C. Bentley]], and [[Freeman Wills Crofts]].  "The English may not always be the best writers in the world, but they are incomparably the best dull writers."  Chandler's critique of the "classic" [[Golden Age of Detective Fiction |Golden Age]] detective story goes beyond a lack of realistic characters and plot; Chandler complains about contrivances and formulas and an inability to move beyond them.  The classic detective story "has learned nothing and forgotten nothing."

Chandler reserves his praise for [[Dashiell Hammett]]. Although Chandler and Hammett were contemporaries and grouped as the founders of the hard-boiled school, Chandler speaks of Hammett as the "one individual... picked out to represent the whole movement," noting Hammett's mastery of the "[[American English|American language]]", his adherence to reality, and that he "gave [[murder]] back to the kind of people that commit it for reasons, not just to provide a corpse."

Chandler concludes his essay by moving from reality in literature to reality itself, "a world in which gangsters can rule nations and almost rule cities... it is not a fragrant world, but it is the world you live in."  He states that this world requires the hero of Hammett's (and his own) fiction, a man who walks the "mean streets" with a sense of honor and a notion of justice, who neither wears them on his sleeve nor allows them to be corrupted.

==References in other work==

The [[Geraldine McEwan]] [[telemovie]] based on Agatha Christie's novel ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' shows [[Miss Marple]] reading Chandler's book. Early in the telemovie Miss Marple says, "There is never anything simple about murder."

'''''The Trojan Women Set Fire to their Fleet''''' is a mid-17th century painting by French artist [[Claude Lorrain]]. Done in oil on canvas, the painting is currently in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

== Description ==
Claude Lorrain painted ''The Trojan Women Set Fire to their Fleet'' around 1643 at the behest of Cardinal [[Girolamo Farnese]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/435908|title=www.metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene is Lorrain's take on a famed event in Book 5 of the ''[[Aeneid]]'' in which the exiled women of [[Troy]], spurred on by the Hellenistic goddess [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], burn the Trojan fleet to force their men to stop roaming and settle in [[Sicily]]. However, [[Aeneas]] prays to the god [[Jupiter]] to save the ships from the flames by summoning a rainstorm; this is eluded to by Lorrain via his inclusion of dark clouds in the top right of the painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:Trésor de Gourdon 04.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Gold chalice, with garnet and turquoise, from the Treasure of Gourdon [[Cabinet des Médailles]], Paris]]
The '''Treasure of Gourdon''' ({{lang-fr|Trésor de Gourdon}}) is a hoard of gold, the objects of which date to the end of the fifth or the beginning of the sixth century AD. They were secreted soon after 524. It was unearthed in 1845 near [[Gourdon, Saône-et-Loire|Gourdon]], [[Saône-et-Loire]]. 

== Contents ==
When it was found, the hoard comprised a [[chalice (cup)|chalice]] and a rectangular [[paten]] that were similarly applied with garnets and turquoises in [[cloisonné]] compartments, together with about a hundred gold coins dating from the reigns of [[Byzantine]] emperors [[Leo I (emperor)|Leo I]] (457&amp;ndash;474) through [[Justin I]] (518&amp;ndash;527). The [[Merovingian]] king [[Clovis I]] converted to [[Christianity]] in 496; the chalice and paten might be called early [[Merovingian]] or late [[Gallo-Roman]].

The treasure is preserved in the [[Cabinet des Médailles]], Paris, a department of the [[Bibliothèque nationale]].
[[Image:Trésor de Gourdon 02.JPG|thumb|left|The paten from Gourdon]]

The chalice is 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm tall. It rests on a truncated conical base; two handles that take the form of highly stylized birds that are recognizable solely by their beaks and [[garnet]]s that form the eyes. The body of the chalice has a reverse-dragooned base. The upper part of the chalice is decorated with [[cloisonné]] garnets and turquoises cut into the shapes of hearts and [[palmette]]s.

The shape of the chalice may be compared to ''cant hares'' of ceramic or metal; the commonly used method of making wine cups among the Romans. The decoration can be considered "[[barbarian]]" in both [[iconography]] and technique, and was made uncommonly light and portable by employing the cloisonné technique. Comparable bird motifs may be traced back to [[Visigoth]], [[Lombards|Lombard]] and Merovingian metalwork.

The rectangular paten is 19.5&amp;nbsp;cm by 12.5&amp;nbsp;cm, and 1.6&amp;nbsp;cm deep. It presents a border of cloisonné garnets, a central cross in garnets and four corner motifs of turquoise. The cross unequivocally identifies the ensemble as Christian.

War in eastern [[Gaul]] in the 520s came against the [[Burgundians]]. It was waged by the four successors of Clovis. The war came to a decisive end with the [[Battle of Vézeronce]], in 524, with a conclusive Burgundian defeat.

== History ==
In the sixth century, Gourdon was the site of a monastery&amp;mdash;possibly the source of these objects. The latest date found among the coins that were part of the hoard is estimated to be circa 524. The treasure may have been buried in anticipation of a raid. 
A shepherd girl, Louise Forest, discovered it below a Roman tile engraved with a cross. The treasure was sold at auction in Paris, 20 July 1846. The paten and chalice were acquired by the State and the documented coins were dispersed and are not available to the public.

== Description ==
''Urban Light'' is composed of 202 street lamps arranged in a near grid. The lamps mostly came from the streets of Southern California, including Hollywood, Glendale, and Anaheim, with some from Portland, Oregon.

Writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Susan Freudenheim described the restored lamps as displaying "elaborate floral and geometric patterns" at the base, with "fluted shafts and glass globes that cap them...meticulously cleaned, painted and refurbished to create an exuberant glow."&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Urban_Light_By_Day.jpg|thumb|left|left|''Urban Light'' by daylight as seen from Wilshire Blvd.]]
Burden viewed his sculpture as a formal entry way to the museum on [[Wilshire Boulevard]]: "I've been driving by these buildings for 40 years, and it's always bugged me how this institution turned its back on the city."&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow" /&gt;

Burden first began collecting street lamps in December 2000 without a specific work in mind, and continued collecting them for the next seven years. He purchased his first two lamps at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] Flea Market at $800 each after they were pointed out by curator [[Paul Schimmel (curator)|Paul Schimmel]]'s son Max. The vendor, Jeff Levine, had been restoring the lamps by salvaging parts and later sold Burden more of his collection. Burden purchased others from contractor and collector Anna Justice, who was instrumental in the restoration of sandblasting, recasting missing parts, rewiring to code, and then painting a uniform grey. As Burden's collection grew, the ground around his [[Topanga Canyon]] studio became littered with parts, which the artist referred to as "lamp carcasses".&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow" /&gt;&lt;ref name=LACMA-CBurden /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unframed.lacma.org/2018/02/06/story-urban-light|title=The Story of Urban Light (including a December 2008 conversation between Michael Govan and Chris Burden)|last=|first=|date=|website=unframed.lacma.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In late 2003, Burden discussed installing a hundred of the lamps at the [[Gagosian Gallery]] in New York, but the gallery eventually balked at the cost. While he later sent 14 lamps to an exhibition in London, his goal was to keep as much of his then 150-piece collection together as possible. To that end, he invited visitors to view the street lamps outside his studio, where he had installed them in dense rows on two sides of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chris Burden: Extreme Measures|last=Philips|first=Lisa|last2=Johanna Burton|publisher=New Museum, New York and Skira Rizzoli Publications|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=208–209|quote=|display-authors=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the prospective purchasers in mid-2006 was The [[Museum für angewandte Kunst Wien|MAK Museum for Applied Art]] in Vienna and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, represented by its new director, [[Michael Govan]]. He visited the studio at twilight, and from the driveway, saw the lights lit and concluded that the installation would be a perfect fit. Govan was followed by Andrew M. Gordon, a [[Goldman Sachs]] executive who would later become chairman of the museum's board. Gordon approved the purchase through his family foundation for an undisclosed price.&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow" /&gt;

''Urban Light'' was preceded by [[Sheila Klein]]'s ''[[Vermonica]]'' (1993)'','' which placed 25 Los Angeles street lamps in a parking lot at the corner of Vermont Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/paul-haddad/meet-las-original-urban-l_b_7528372.html|title=Meet L.A.'s Original 'Urban Light'|date=June 8, 2015|publisher=The Huffington Post|issue=|agency=|ref=|last1=Haddad|first1=Paul|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The ''Urban Light'' installation took place amid changes to the LACMA campus, which included a new building, the Broad Contemporary Art Museum, and two new open spaces. The sculpture dominates one of them, a [[forecourt]] located between Wilshire Boulevard and LACMA's entry pavilion.&lt;ref name="HawthorneReview" /&gt;

''Los Angeles Times'' critic Christopher Hawthorne gave the arrangement a mixed review, describing ''Urban Light'' as "a kind of pop temple, deftly straddling the lines between art and architecture and between seriousness and irony." "It's also a joy to walk through, but there's no getting around the fact that it turns what might have been an actual public square along Wilshire—a space defined from day to day by the people using it—into an outdoor room for one sizable and very insistent piece of art."&lt;ref name="HawthorneReview"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawthorne|first=Christopher|title=ARCHITECTURE REVIEW; County museum's expansion reflects two clashing visions; The new building is Eli Broad's realm, while LACMA's director applies his influence elsewhere|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/feb/07/entertainment/et-bcamarch7|accessdate=29 February 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hawthorne also argued that ''Urban Light'' was the first of four large-scale installations at LACMA in which Michael Govan challenged and undermined "the polite axial symmetry of the master plan he inherited from" architect [[Renzo Piano]] and his patrons.  Those installations also include Tony Smith's black aluminum sculpture, called "Smoke", that fills the atrium of the Ahmanson Building, a palm garden by [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]] installed along the edge of the Resnick Pavilion, and, just north, [[Michael Heizer]]'s ''[[Levitated Mass]]''.&lt;ref name="LA Times Large scale art"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawthorne|first=Christopher|title=Critic's Notebook: Art on an architectural scale at LACMA|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-rock-notebook-20120708,0,1083093.story|accessdate=7 July 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although ''Urban Light'' fills what had been Renzo Piano's planned "public square" space, it nevertheless succeeded where the empty public space dismally failed.  K. M. Williamson, social ecologist and director of [[Public Art in Public Places]], saw ''Urban Light'' as not reducing the plaza space but instead fundamentally redefining it and enlivening it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apalosangeles.org/public-art-in-public-places-l-a-s-iconic-urban-light/|title=L.A.'s Iconic "Urban Light": August is Art Appreciation Month - What if it was also Public Space Planning Appreciation Month?"|last=Williamson|first=K. M.|date=August 15, 2014|website=American Planning Association {{!}} Los Angeles|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Govan believed that ''Urban Light'' imparted a "feeling of walking through an ancient temple", one that echos the Greco-Roman temple facades of many East Coast museums. Those facades "are really faux; they’re neoclassical,...and here [Burden has] assembled an honest-to-goodness Los Angeles temple made of local materials, in our time."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  ,

==Cultural status==
Since its 2008 installation, ''Urban Light'' has become an extremely popular attraction.  According to Public Art in Public Places, ''Urban Light'' has become the most visited, photographed and well-known public artwork in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/urban-light/vgGacTHf37eEwQ|title=Urban Light - Chris Burden 2008|last=Public Art in Public Places|first=|date=2016|website=Google Arts &amp; Culture|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Director [[Ivan Reitman]] was one of the first filmmakers to incorporate the public artwork in a motion picture, using the location for a scene in his film ''[[No Strings Attached (film)|No Strings Attached]]''. Echoing Burden's own view,&lt;ref name="LA TimesGlow" /&gt; he called the artwork "an extraordinary beacon" that "lights up a desperate part of Wilshire that felt almost abandoned at night." ''Urban Light'' was featured in the [[Tori Amos]] video ''Maybe California'' and the film ''[[Valentine's Day (2010 film)|Valentine's Day]]''. The work appeared in a [[Guinness]] commercial and in a ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article featuring cast members of the television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', as well as in numerous amateur photos posted online. LACMA itself has featured the work as part of its own promotional efforts, including a 3D public service announcement preceding the film ''[[Megamind]]''.&lt;ref name=LATimes-sceens&gt;{{cite news|last=Finkel|first=Jori|title='Urban Light' lights up the screen|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/25/entertainment/la-et-urban-light-as-icon-20110125|accessdate=27 February 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the sculpture was used in a dance scene in VH1's [[Hit the Floor (TV series)|''Hit the Floor'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://twitter.com/Dance9Tiffany/status/473676624366665728|title = Tiffany Maher feed: 'A night I will never forget ~ @hitthefloor #devilgirls @LACMA @VH1'|date = June 2, 2014|website = Twitter|publisher = |last = Maher|first = Tiffany}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The first known selfie taken at the sculpture was shot four days after the work opened and was posted to [[Flickr]]. The sculpture has its own hashtag: #urbanlight. While not rented out as a wedding site, ''Urban Light'' has been the setting for many vows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In [[colorimetry]], '''whiteness''' is the degree to which a surface is white. An example of its use might be to quantitatively compare two pieces of paper which appear white viewed individually, but not when juxtaposed.

The [[International Commission on Illumination]] describes it in the following terms:

{{quote|To promote uniformity of practice in the evaluation of whiteness of surface colors, it
is recommended that the formulæ for whiteness, W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or W&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, and for [[tint]], T&lt;sub&gt;w,2&lt;/sub&gt; or T&lt;sub&gt;w,10&lt;/sub&gt;, given below, be used for comparisons of the whiteness of samples evaluated for CIE [[standard illuminant]] [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]]. The application of the formulae is restricted to samples that are called "white" commercially, that do not differ much in color and fluorescence, and that are measured on the same instrument at nearly the same time. Within these restrictions, the formulæ provide relative, but not absolute, evaluations of whiteness, that are adequate for commercial use, when employing measuring instruments having suitable modern and commercially available facilities.|[http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/15-2004.html CIE Publication 15:2004]}}

==Calculation==
&lt;math&gt;W_2=Y_2+800(x_{n,2}-x_2)+1700(y_{n,2}-y_2)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;W_{10}=Y_{10}+800(x_{n,10}-x_{10})+1700(y_{n,10}-y_{10})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_{w,2}=1000(x_{n,2}-x_2)-650(y_{n,2}-y_2)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_{w,10}=900(x_{n,10}-x_{10})-650(y_{n,10}-y_{10})&lt;/math&gt;

where

* Y is the Y [[tristimulus value]] ([[relative luminance]]),
* (x,y) is the [[chromaticity coordinate]] in the [[CIE 1931 color space]]
* (x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) is the chromaticity coordinate of the [[diffuser (optics)#Perfect reflecting diffuser|perfect diffuser]] (reference white)

The numbers in the subscript indicate the observer: two for the CIE 1931 [[standard observer]] and ten for the CIE 1964 standard observer.

===Notes===
* W increases with whiteness, reaching 100 for the perfect diffuser.
* The tint is green for positive T and red for negative T.
* Equal differences in W may not appear equally different.
