It is located in the [[Civic Center, San Francisco|Civic Center]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]], in the United States. The {{Convert|15|ft|adj=on}} [[statue]] depicting the Assyrian [[Ashurbanipal|king of the same name]] was commissioned by the Assyrian Foundation for the Arts and presented to the City of San Francisco in 1988 as a gift from the [[Assyrian people]]. The sculpture reportedly cost $100,000 and was the first "sizable" bronze statue of Ashurbanipal.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; It is administered by the City and County of San Francisco and the [[San Francisco Arts Commission]].

Parhad's work was met with some criticism by local Assyrians, who argued it was inaccurate to portray Ashurbanipal holding a [[clay tablet]] and a lion, or wearing a [[skirt]]. The critics thought the statue looked more like the [[Sumer]]ian king [[Gilgamesh]]; Renee Kovacs, a "scholar and self-stated Assyriologist", believed the sculpture depicted neither figure, but rather a [[Mesopotamia]]n "protective figure". Parhad defended the accuracy of his work, while also admitting that he took [[Artistic license|artistic liberties]].&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Hero lion Dur-Sharrukin Louvre AO19862.jpg|thumb|left|Possible representation of Enkidu as [[Master of Animals]] grasping a lion and snake, in an [[Assyrian palace relief]], from [[Dur-Sharrukin]], now Louvre]]
In [[Assyrian sculpture]], the famous colossal entrance way guardian figures of ''[[lamassu]]'' were often accompanied by a hero grasping a wriggling lion with one hand and typically a snake with the other, also colossal and in high relief; these are generally the only other types of high relief in Assyrian sculpture.  They continue the [[Master of Animals]] tradition in Mesopotamian art, and may represent [[Enkidu]], a central figure in the [[Ancient Mesopotamia]]n ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.  In the palace of [[Sargon II]] at [[Khorsabad]], a group of at least seven ''lamassu'' and two such heroes with lions surrounded the entrance to the "throne room", "a concentration of figures which produced an overwhelming impression of power."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Frankfort|Frankfort, Henri]], ''The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient'', pp. 147-148, 148 quoted, Pelican History of Art, 4th ed 1970, Penguin (now Yale History of Art), {{ISBN|0140561072}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrangement was repeated in [[Sennacherib]]'s palace at [[Nineveh]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, John M., Section 6.

==History==
''Ashurbanipal'' was designed by Fred Parhad, an [[Iraq]]i-born artist of [[Assyria]]n descent. Parhad rejected formal arts studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and relocated to New York, where the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] allowed him to study its Assyrian collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caroun.com/Sculpture/Artists/USA/FredParhad/FredParhad.html|title=Fred Parhad|accessdate=August 9, 2013|publisher=Caroun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was commissioned by the Assyrian Foundation for the Arts under the direction of its president, [[Narsai David]].&lt;ref name=Ishaya&gt;{{Cite journal|work=Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies|first=Arianne|last=Ishaya|title=Settling Into Diaspora: A History of Urmia Assyrians in the United States|accessdate=August 9, 2013|year=2006|volume=20|number=1|page=26|url=http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v20n1/Arianne-diaspora.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Assyrian Universal Alliance Foundation also claims to have commissioned the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.auaf.us/Who%20is%20who/Art/Art.htm |title=Who Is Who |publisher=Assyrian Universal Alliance Foundation |accessdate=August 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200831/http://www.auaf.us/Who%20is%20who/Art/Art.htm |archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Funds were collected from [[Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac Americans|Assyrians throughout the United States]].&lt;ref name=Fernandez&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19871228&amp;id=1v4yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=efwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6964,9530701|title=Statue of Assyrian king in skirt stirs controversy|work=[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph]]|location=Nashua, New Hampshire|volume=119|number=228|oclc=22532489|first=Elizabeth|last=Fernandez|date=December 31, 1987|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, ''[[The Telegraph (Nashua)|The Telegraph]]'' reported that the work cost $100,000 and was the first "sizable" bronze statue of [[Ashurbanipal]].&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; It was presented to the City of San Francisco as a gift from the [[Assyrian people]] on May 29, 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.batw.org/articles/georgia-hesse_december-2012/|title="Promoting Yourself in the Digital Age" – by Georgia I.

The [[Smithsonian Institution]] lists Frank Tomsick as the installation's architect and MBT Associates as its architectural firm. ''Ashurbanipal'' was surveyed by the Smithsonian's [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] program in 1992.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt; In 1996, plans for a Civic Center pedestrian mall were being developed by the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association; one planner advocated for construction of an Assyrian garden, including [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] blossoms, pomegranate trees and reeds, at the site of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/A-mall-sans-shops-or-cars-3157841.php|title=A mall sans shops or cars|first=Gerald D.|last=Adams|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=February 26, 1996|accessdate=August 12, 2013|issn=1932-8672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1987, as news began to circulate about the commissioned work, local Assyrians accused Parhad of misrepresenting Ashurbanipal. Criticisms included the depiction of the king holding both a book and a lion, which they argued he "wouldn't do", and for dressing him in a skirt, which they claimed he would never have worn.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; The critics thought the statue made a better portrayal of the [[Sumer]]ian king [[Gilgamesh]]. One critic said: &lt;blockquote&gt;It's very simple. The statue represents Gilgamesh.... No Assyrian has a right to imagine things about our king. It's exactly like making a copy of the Statue of Liberty and saying it is George Washington.... Assyrian kings didn't wear miniskirts. They wouldn't have been holding a lion or a book. It's an insult to the Assyrians.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Narsai David responded: &lt;blockquote&gt;They are entitled to their opinion.... We have never said this is a museum-quality reproduction.... We have always said this is a characterization of Ashurbanipal as done by a 20th-century artist. If they choose to think of this as Gilgamesh, they are free to do so.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Renee Kovacs, a "scholar and self-stated Assyriologist", said the statue depicted neither Ashurbanipal or Gilgamesh, but rather a [[Mesopotamia]]n "protective figure, like a guard."&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt; Parhad defended the accuracy of his work, while also admitting that he took [[Artistic license|artistic liberties]] and attempted to incorporate the various aspects of Assyrian culture, from its hunting mastery to its admiration for writing. He said of the sculpture: &lt;blockquote&gt;The piece has authentic qualities to it, but it is also my statue.... With the earrings and the clothing and the hair and his daggers, it is Ashurbanipal. But in the choice of (stance), the fact that he is holding a tablet and a lion, that is mine. I wanted myself to be represented in the piece.&lt;ref name=Fernandez/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''''Avanton Gold Cone''''' or '''''Avanton Cone''''' ({{lang-fr|Cône d'Or d'Avanton}} or {{lang-fr|Cône d'Avanton}}) is a late [[Bronze Age]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artefact]], belonging to the group of [[Golden hats]], only four of which are known so far. 

The Avanton Cone was the second such object to be discovered (after the [[Golden Hat of Schifferstadt]]). It was found in 1844 in a field near the village of [[Avanton]], about 12 km north of [[Poitiers]], [[France]]. The object was damaged; comparison with other finds suggests that a part (the brim) is missing. The remaining part of the Avanton cone is 55 cm long and weighs 285 g. Originally dated to the Middle Bronze and suggested to be a [[phallic symbol|fertility symbol]], it now appears to be of later date and more complex function (see [[Golden hats]]).

The Avanton Cone is on display in the [[Musée d'Archéologie Nationale]] at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], near [[Paris]].

==Etymology==
The word ''batik'' is [[Javanese language|Javanese]] in origin. It may either come from the Javanese word ''amba'' ('to write') and ''titik'' ('dot'), or may derive from a hypothetical [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] root ''*beCík'' ('to tattoo'). The word is first recorded in English in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] of 1880, in which it is spelled ''battik''. It is attested in the [[Indonesian Archipelago]] during the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonial period in various forms: ''mbatek'', ''mbatik'', ''batek'' and ''batik''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50018371?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=batik&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 Oxford English Dictionary: ''Batik'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=batik Dictionary.com: ''Batik'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=3623057 | title=Austronesian Etymologies - IV | author=Blust, Robert | journal=Oceanic Linguistics | date=Winter 1989 | volume=28 | issue=2 | pages=111–180 | authorlink=Robert Blust | doi=10.2307/3623057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Niya batik.jpg|thumb|Wax-resist dyed textile from [[Niya (Tarim Basin)]], China]]
[[File:Prajnaparamita clothes detail.JPG|thumb|Pattern of clothes of 13th century East Javanese [[Prajnaparamita]] statue resembles batik]]

Wax resist dyeing of fabric is an ancient art form. It already existed in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in the 4th century BC, where it was used to wrap mummies; linen was soaked in wax, and scratched using a stylus. In Asia, the technique was practised in China during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907 AD), and in India and Japan during the [[Nara Period]] (645-794 AD). In Africa it was originally practised by the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] tribe in Nigeria, [[Soninke people|Soninke]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] in Senegal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Nadia Nava, ''Il batik'' - Ulissedizioni - 1991 {{ISBN|88-414-1016-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These African version however, uses [[cassava]] starch or rice paste, or mud as a resist instead of [[beeswax]].&lt;ref name="BGAfrica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Batik in Africa |url=http://www.batikguild.org.uk/historyAfrica.asp | publisher=The Batik Guild| accessdate=29 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of batik is most highly developed in the island of [[Java]] in [[Indonesia]]. In Java, all the materials for the process are readily available — cotton and beeswax and plants from which different vegetable dyes are made.&lt;ref name="BGJava"&gt;{{cite web | title=Batik in Java | url=http://www.batikguild.org.uk/historyJava.asp | publisher=The Batik Guild | accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian batik predates written records: G. P. Rouffaer argues that the technique might have been introduced during the 6th or 7th century from India or Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; On the other hand, the Dutch archaeologist J.L.A. Brandes and the Indonesian archaeologist F.A. Sutjipto believe Indonesian batik is a native tradition, since other regions in Indonesia such as [[Toraja]], [[Flores]], [[Halmahera]], and [[West Papua (region)|Papua]], which were not directly influenced by Hinduism, have an age-old tradition of batik making.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.my"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yJVgQAAACAAJ&amp;dq=iwan+tirta Iwan Tirta, Gareth L. Steen, Deborah M. Urso, Mario Alisjahbana, 'Batik: a play of lights and shades, Volume 1', By Gaya Favorit Press, 1996] {{ISBN|979-515-313-7}} {{ISBN|978-979-515-313-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rouffaer reported that the ''gringsing'' pattern was already known by the 12th century in [[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]], [[East Java]]. He concluded that this delicate pattern could be created only by using the ''[[canting]]'', an etching tool that holds a small reservoir of hot wax, and proposed that the ''canting'' was invented in Java around that time.&lt;ref name="books.google.com.my"/&gt; The carving details of clothes worn by East Javanese [[Prajnaparamita]] statues from around the 13th century show intricate floral patterns within rounded margins, similar to today's traditional Javanese ''jlamprang'' or ''ceplok'' batik motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Keunikan Makna Filosofi Batik Klasik: Motif Jlamprang | date=19 July 2013 | url=http://fitinline.com/article/read/keunikan-makna-filosofi-batik-klasik-motif-jlamprang| publisher=Fit in line | language=Indonesian | accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motif is thought to represent the [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]], a sacred flower in Hindu-Buddhist beliefs. This evidence suggests that intricate batik fabric patterns applied with the ''canting'' existed in 13th-century Java or even earlier.&lt;ref name="Volkenkunde"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prajnaparamita and other Buddhist deities |url=http://volkenkunde.nl/nl/node/1049 |publisher=Volkenkunde Rijksmuseum |accessdate=1 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004644/http://volkenkunde.nl/nl/node/1049 |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, the technique was described for the first time in the ''History of Java'', published in London in 1817 by [[Stamford Raffles]], who had been a British governor for Bengkulu, Sumatra. In 1873 the Dutch merchant [[Van Rijckevorsel]] gave the pieces he collected during a trip to Indonesia to the ethnographic museum in Rotterdam. Today the [[Tropenmuseum]] houses the biggest collection of Indonesian batik in the Netherlands. The Dutch and Chinese colonists were active in developing batik, particularly coastal batik, in the late colonial era. They introduced new patterns as well as the use of the ''cap'' (copper block stamps) to mass-produce batiks. Displayed at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] at Paris in 1900, the Indonesian batik impressed the public and artists.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; &lt;!--After the independence of Indonesia and the decline of the Dutch textile industry, the Dutch batik production was lost. The [[Gemeentemuseum]], [[The Hague]] contains artefacts from that era.--&gt;

In the 1920s, Javanese batik makers migrating to Malaya (now Malaysia) introduced the use of wax and copper blocks to its east coast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khm.uio.no/utstillinger/malaysia/engelsk/0_b_side1.html Museum of Cultural History, Oslo: Malaysia - Batikktradisjoner i bevegelse]. Retrieved 29 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Subsaharan Africa]], Javanese batik was introduced in the 19th century by Dutch and English traders. The local people there adapted the Javanese batik, making larger motifs with thicker lines and more colours. In the 1970s, batik was introduced to Australia, where aboriginal artists at Erna Bella have developed it as their own craft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.republika.co.id/berita/breaking-news/seni-budaya/11/02/09/163234-antropolog-australia-beri-ceramah-soal-batik Antropolog Australia Beri Ceramah Soal Batik]. Retrieved 29 April 2014. (in Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[File:Women Making Batik, Ketelan crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Batik craftswomen in Java drawing intricate patterns using ''canting'' and wax that are kept hot and liquid in a heated small pan.]]

Firstly, a cloth is washed, soaked and beaten with a large mallet. Patterns are drawn with pencil and later redrawn using hot wax, usually made from a mixture of [[Alkane|paraffin]] or [[beeswax]], sometimes mixed with plant resins, which functions as a dye-resist. The wax can be applied with a variety of tools. A pen-like instrument called a ''[[canting]]'' ({{IPA-jv|tʃantiŋ}}, sometimes spelled with [[Van Ophuijsen Spelling System|old Dutch orthography]] ''tjanting'') is the most common. A ''tjanting'' is made from a small copper reservoir with a spout on a wooden handle. The reservoir holds the resist which flows through the spout, creating dots and lines as it moves. For larger patterns, a stiff brush may be used.&lt;ref name="rita"&gt;Trefois, Rita (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4O8cAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99 Fascinating Batik]''. {{ISBN|978-90-815246-2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, a copper block stamp called a ''cap'' ({{IPA-jv|tʃap}}; old spelling ''tjap'') is used to cover large areas more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Batik Nomination for inscription on the Representative List in 2009 (Reference No. 00170)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Making Batik in Indonesia.jpg|thumb|upright|Applying wax using ''cap'' (copper plate stamps).]]

After the cloth is dry, the resist is removed by boiling or scraping the cloth. The areas treated with resist keep their original colour; when the resist is removed the contrast between the dyed and undyed areas forms the pattern.&lt;ref name="charan"&gt;{{cite web |last=Charan | title=Indian batik: Another Ancient Art of Printing on Textiles | url=http://charancreations.blogspot.in/2011/09/indian-batik-another-ancient-art-of.html | accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is repeated as many times as the number of colours desired.

The most traditional type of batik, called batik ''tulis'' (written batik), is drawn using only the ''canting''. The cloth needs to be drawn on both sides, and dipped in a dye bath three to four times. The whole process may take up to a year; it yields considerably finer patterns than stamped batik.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

==Culture==

===Indonesia===
Many Indonesian batik patterns are symbolic. Infants are carried in batik slings decorated with symbols designed to bring the child luck, and certain batik designs are reserved for brides and bridegrooms, as well as their families.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; Some designs are reserved for royalties, and even banned to be worn by commoners. Consequently, a person's rank could be determined by the pattern of the batik he or she wore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Batik-The-Forbidden-Designs-of-Java|title=Batik: The Forbidden Designs of Java - Australian Museum|work=australianmuseum.net.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/07/11/batik-patterns-hold-deep-significance.html |title=Batik patterns hold deep significance |work=thejakartapost.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502005919/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/07/11/batik-patterns-hold-deep-significance.html |archivedate=2 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further study to the geometry of symbolism in Indonesian batik showed the applicability of [[fractal]] [[geometry]] in traditional designs.&lt;ref&gt;Situngkir, Hokky; Dahlan, Rolan; Surya, Yohanes. '''''Fisika batik : implementasi kreatif melalui sifat fraktal pada batik secara komputasional _ xvi, 106 or 56 pages : illustrations (some color) ; 17 cm''''' ___ Jakarta: Gramedia Pustaka Utama  (2009). {{ISBN|9789792244847}} &amp; {{ISBN|9792244840}} https://www.worldcat.org/title/fisika-batik-implementasi-kreatif-melalui-sifat-fraktal-pada-batik-secara-komputasional/oclc/426034949&lt;/ref&gt;

Batik garments play a central role in certain Javanese rituals, such as the ceremonial casting of royal batik into a volcano. In the Javanese [[tujuh bulanan|''naloni mitoni'']] ceremony, the mother-to-be is wrapped in seven layers of batik, wishing her good things. Batik is also prominent in the ''tedak siten'' ceremony when a child touches the earth for the first time.&lt;!--Batik is also part of the [[labuhan]] ceremony when people gather at a beach to throw their problems away into the sea.--&gt;&lt;ref name="batik days"&gt;{{cite web | title = Batik Days | newspaper = [[The Jakarta Post]] | date = 2 October 2009 | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/10/02/batik-days.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, [[UNESCO]] designated Indonesian batik as a [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity|Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]. As part of the acknowledgment, UNESCO insisted that Indonesia preserve its heritage.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=00170|title=UNESCO Culture Sector - Intangible Heritage - 2003 Convention :|author=UNESCO - Intangible Heritage Section|work=unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day, October 2, 2009 has been stated by Indonesian government as National [[Batik Day]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://setkab.go.id/berita-10487-ingat-besok-hari-batik-nasional-wajib-pakai-batik.html |title = Ingat, Besok Hari Batik Nasional, Wajib Pakai Batik |website = setkab.go.id |access-date = 1 October 2013 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131003214201/http://setkab.go.id/berita-10487-ingat-besok-hari-batik-nasional-wajib-pakai-batik.html |archivedate = 3 October 2013 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as also at the time the map of Indonesian batik diversity by [[Hokky Situngkir]] was opened for public for the first time by the Indonesian Ministry of Research and Technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surya.ac.id/viewarticle/0/0/76/Mengupas.Center.for.Complexity.Surya.University|title=Mengupas Center for Complexity Surya University |access-date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Popularity====
The popularity of batik in [[Indonesia]] has varied. Historically, it was essential for ceremonial costumes and it was worn as part of a ''[[kebaya]]'' dress, commonly worn every day. The use of batik was already recorded in the 12th century, and the textile has become a strong source of identity for Indonesians crossing religious, racial and cultural boundaries. It is also believed the motif made the batik famous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indonesialogue.com/destinations/book-review-batik-creating-an-identity.html|title=Book Review – Batik: Creating an Identity|work=WhyGo Indonesia|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713030220/http://www.indonesialogue.com/destinations/book-review-batik-creating-an-identity.html|archivedate=13 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The batik industry of Java flourished from the late 1800s to early 1900s, but declined during the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=br/&gt; With increasing preference of western clothing, the batik industry further declined following the Indonesian independence. Batik has somewhat revived at the turn of the 21st century, through the efforts of Indonesian fashion designers to innovate batik by incorporating new colours, fabrics, and patterns. Batik has become a fashion item for many Indonesians, and may be seen on shirts, dresses, or scarves for casual wear; it is a preferred replacement for jacket-and-tie at certain receptions. Traditional batik [[sarong]]s are still used in many occasions.&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;

After the UNESCO recognition for Indonesian batik on 2 October 2009, the Indonesian administration asked Indonesians to wear batik on Fridays, and wearing batik every Friday has been encouraged in government offices and private companies ever since.&lt;ref name=batikday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/09/29/administration-calls-allin-batik-day-friday.html|title=Administration calls for all-in batik day this Friday|work=thejakartapost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2 October is also celebrated as National Batik Day in Indonesia.&lt;ref name=batikday/&gt; Batik had helped improve the [[small business]] local economy, batik sales in Indonesia had reached Rp 3.9 trillion (US$436.8 million) in 2010, an increase from Rp 2.5 trillion in 2006. The value of batik exports, meanwhile, increased from $14.3 million in 2006 to $22.3 million in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/28/let%E2%80%99s-use-batik-diplomatic-tool-sby.html |title=Let’s use batik as diplomatic tool: SBY |work=thejakartapost.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001182019/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/09/28/let%E2%80%99s-use-batik-diplomatic-tool-sby.html |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batik is also popular in the neighbouring countries of Singapore and Malaysia. It is produced in Malaysia with similar, but not identical, methods to those used in Indonesia. Prior to UNESCO's recognition and following the [[2009 Pendet controversy]], Indonesia and Malaysia disputed the ownership of batik culture. However, Dr Fiona Kerlogue of the [[Horniman museum]] argued that the Malaysian printed wax textiles, made for about a century, were quite a different tradition from the "very fine" traditional Indonesian batiks produced for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/6251806/Indonesians-tell-Malaysians-Hands-off-our-batik.html Indonesians tell Malaysians 'Hands off our batik'] Telegraph.co.uk, accessed 8 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Batik is featured in the national airline uniforms of the three countries, represented by batik prints worn by flight attendants of [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Garuda Indonesia]] and [[Malaysian Airline System|Malaysian Airlines]]. The female uniform of Garuda Indonesia flight attendants is a modern interpretation of the Kartini style ''[[kebaya]]'' with ''parang gondosuli'' motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://female.kompas.com/read/xml/2010/09/26/11502730/terbang.bersama.kebaya | title=Terbang Bersama Kebaya | accessdate=24 October 2011 | author = Indriasari, Lusiana | author2=Yulia Sapthiani | date=26 September 2010 | publisher=Female Kompas.com| language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.garuda-indonesia.com/news/2010/06/02/garuda-indonesia-launches-new-uniform |title=Garuda Indonesia Launches New Uniform |accessdate=24 October 2011 |author=Pujobroto, PT |date=2 June 2010 |publisher=Garuda Indonesia.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929225218/http://www.garuda-indonesia.com/news/2010/06/02/garuda-indonesia-launches-new-uniform |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Terminology====
[[File:Naming the parts of a kain batik.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Terminology of Indonesian batik]]
Batik is traditionally sold in 2.25-metre lengths used for ''kain panjang'' or [[sarong]]. It is worn by wrapping it around the hip, or made into a hat known as [[blangkon]]. The cloth can be filled continuously with a single pattern or divided into several sections.

Certain patterns are only used in certain sections of the cloth. For example, a row of [[isosceles triangle]]s, forming the ''pasung'' motif, as well as diagonal floral motifs called ''dhlorong'', are commonly used for the head. However, ''pasung'' and ''dhlorong'' are occasionally found in the body. Other motifs such as ''buketan'' (flower bouquet) and birds are commonly used in either the head or the body.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

* The head is a rectangular section of the cloth which is worn at the front. The head section can be at the middle of the cloth, or placed at one or both ends. The ''papan'' inside of the head can be used to determine whether the cloth is ''kain panjang'' or sarong.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;
* The body is the main part of the cloth, and is filled with a wide variety of patterns. The body can be divided into two alternating patterns and colours called ''pagi-sore'' ('dawn-dusk'). Brighter pattern are shown during the day, while darker pattern are shown in the evening. The alternating colours give the impression of two batik sets.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;
* Margins are often plain, but floral and lace-like patterns, as well as wavy lines described as a dragon, are common in the area beside ''seret''.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

====Types====
As each region has its own traditional pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as batik [[Surakarta|Solo]], batik [[Pekalongan]], and batik [[Madura]]. Batiks from Java can be distinguished by their general pattern and colours into ''batik pedalaman'' (inland batik) or ''batik pesisir'' (coastal batik). Batiks which do not fall neatly into one of these two categories are only referred to by their region. A mapping of batik designs from all places in Indonesia depicts the similarities and reflects cultural assimilation within batik designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://compsoc.bandungfe.net/kartografi-indonesia/motif-EN.html | title=Phylomemetic Tree of Indonesian Traditional Batik | author=Hokky Situngkir | date=2 February 2009 | accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Javanese Batik=====

======Inland Batik======
[[File:Batik pedalaman banner.jpg|thumb|centre|1110px|A typical inland batik has deep earthy colours with various indigenous patterns (contemporary ''kain panjang'' with ''sidha'' pattern from Solo).]]
Inland batik or ''batik kraton'' (Javanese court batik) is the oldest form of batik tradition known in Java. Inland batik has earthy colour&lt;ref name=pameran&gt;[http://www.iias.nl/sites/default/files/IIAS_NL62_56.pdf Reichle, Natasha (2012). "Batik: Spectacular Textiles of Java" ''The Newsletter''. International Institute for Asian Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; such as black, indigo, brown, and ''sogan'' (brown-yellow colour made from the tree ''[[Peltophorum pterocarpum]]''), sometimes against a white background, with symbolic patterns that are mostly free from outside influence. Certain patterns are reserved for royalty, while other are worn on specific occasions. At a Javanese wedding for example, the bride wears specific patterns at each stage of the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batik-indo.com/ |title=Arti dan Cerita di balik Motif Batik Klasik Jawa |author=Nunuk Pulandari |date=13 April 2011 |accessdate=9 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925134318/http://www.batik-indo.com/ |archivedate=25 September 2015 |df=dmy }} (in Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt; Noted inland batiks are produced in [[Surakarta|Solo]] and [[Jogjakarta]], cities traditionally regarded as the centre of [[Javanese culture]]. ''Batik Solo'' typically has ''sogan'' background and is preserved by the [[Susuhunan]] and [[Mangkunegaran|Mangkunegaran Court]]. ''Batik Jogja'' typically has white background and is preserved by the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]] and [[Pakualaman|Pakualaman Court]].&lt;ref name="batik days"/&gt;

======Coastal Batik======
[[File:Batik pesisir1 banner.jpg|thumb|centre|1110px|In contrast, a typical coastal batik has vibrant colours with patterns drawn from numerous cultures (''kain panjang'' with lotus motifs from Semarang, 1880).]]
Coastal batik is produced in several areas of northern [[Java]] and [[Madura]]. In contrast to inland batik, coastal batiks have vibrant colours and patterns inspired by a wide range of cultures as a consequence of maritime trading.&lt;ref name=pameran/&gt; Recurring motifs include European flower bouquets, [[Chinese phoenix]], and Persian peacocks.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt; Noted coastal batiks are produced in [[Pekalongan]], [[Cirebon]], [[Lasem]], [[Tuban]], and [[Madura]]. Pekalongan has the most active batik industry.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

A notable sub-type of coastal batik called ''Jawa Hokokai'' is not attributed to a particular region. During the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]] in early 1940, the batik industry greatly declined due to material shortages. The workshops funded by the Japanese however were able to produce extremely fine batiks called ''Jawa Hokokai''.&lt;ref name=br&gt;Sumarsono, Hartono; Ishwara, Helen; Yahya, L.R. Supriyapto; Moeis, Xenia (2013). ''Benang Raja: Menyimpul Keelokan Batik Pesisir''.  Jakarta: Kepustakaan Populer Gramedia. {{ISBN|978-979-9106-01-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Common motifs of ''Hokokai'' includes Japanese [[cherry blossoms]], butterflies, and chrysanthemums.

Another coastal batik called ''tiga negeri'' (batik of three lands) is attributed to three regions: Lasem, Pekalongan, and Solo, where the batik would be dipped in red, blue, and ''sogan'' dyes respectively. As of 1980, batik ''tiga negeri'' was only produced in one city.&lt;ref name=br/&gt;

=====Sundanese Batik=====
[[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] or Priangan Batik is the term for batik from the [[Priangan]] region of [[West Java]] and [[Banten]].&lt;ref&gt;Pradito, Didit; Jusuf, Herman; Atik, Saftyaningsih Ken (2010). ''The Dancing Peacock: Colours and Motifs of Priangan Batik''. Jakarta: Gramedia Pustaka Utama. {{ISBN|978-979-22-5825-7}}. Page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Although Priangan batiks can use a wide range of colours, a preference for [[indigo]] is seen in some of its variants. Natural [[indigo dye]] made from ''[[Indigofera]]'' is among the oldest known dyes in Java, and its local name ''tarum'' has lent its name to the [[Citarum river]] and the [[Tarumanagara]] kingdom, which suggests that ancient West Java was once a major producer of natural indigo. Noted Priangan batik is produced in [[Ciamis]], [[Garut]], and [[Tasikmalaya]]. Other traditions include Batik [[Kuningan]] influenced by batik Cirebon, batik [[Banten]] that developed quite independently, and an older tradition of batik [[Baduy people|Baduy]].

Batik [[Banten]] employs bright [[pastel colours]] and represents a revival of a lost art from the [[Sultanate of Banten]], rediscovered through archaeological work during 2002–2004. Twelve motifs from locations such as Surosowan and several other places have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haki.lipi.go.id/utama.cgi?cetakfenomena&amp;1113177052 Uke Kurniawan, Memopulerkan Batik Banten], haki.lipi.go.id, accessed 4 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Batik [[Baduy people|Baduy]] only employs [[indigo]] colour in shades ranged from bluish black to deep blue. It is traditionally worn as ''iket'', a type of [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] headress similar to [[Balinese people|Balinese]] ''udeng'', by Outer Baduy people of [[Lebak Regency]], [[Banten]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.antaranews.com/berita/316176/batik-baduy-diminati-pengunjung-jakarta-fair |title=Batik Baduy diminati pengunjung Jakarta Fair |date=15 June 2012 |publisher=Antara News.com |language=Indonesian |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729004247/http://www.antaranews.com/berita/316176/batik-baduy-diminati-pengunjung-jakarta-fair |archivedate=29 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Sumatran Batik=====
Trade relations between the [[Melayu Kingdom]] in [[Jambi]] and Javanese coastal cities have thrived since the 13th century. Therefore, coastal batik from northern Java probably influenced Jambi. In 1875, Haji Mahibat from Central Java revived the declining batik industry in Jambi. The village of Mudung Laut in Pelayangan district is known for producing batik Jambi. Batik Jambi, as well as Javanese batik, influenced the [[Malaysian batik]].&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Traveller Indonesia, Vol 1, No 6, 2009, Jakarta, Indonesia, page 54&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] people also produce batik called ''batiak tanah liek'' (clay batik), which use clay as dye for the fabric. The fabric is immersed in clay for more than 1 day and later designed with motifs of animal and flora.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Batik from [[Bengkulu]], a city on west coast of Sumatra, is called ''Batik Besurek'', which literary means "batik with letters" as they draw inspiration from [[Arabic calligraphy]].

=====Balinese Batik=====
Batik making in the island of [[Bali]] is relatively new, but a fast-growing industry. Many patterns are inspired by local designs, which are favoured by the local [[Balinese people|Balinese]] and domestic tourists.&lt;ref&gt;http://batikasliindonesia.blogdetik.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Objects from nature such as [[frangipani]] and [[hibiscus]] flowers, birds or fishes, and daily activities such as [[Balinese dance]]r and ''[[ngaben]]'' processions or religious and mythological creatures such as ''[[Barong (mythology)|barong]]'', ''[[Kāla (time)|kala]]'' and winged lion are common. Modern batik artists express themselves freely in a wide range of subjects.&lt;ref name="balibatik"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balibatiku.com/balibatik.html|title=Bali Batik, Bali Sarong, Kimono - Bali Textiles, Bali Garment, Clothing - balibatiku.com|work=balibatiku.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary batik is not limited to traditional or ritual wearing in Bali. Some designers promote batik Bali as elegant fabric that can be used to make casual or formal cloth. Using high class batik, like hand made ''batik tulis'', can show social status.&lt;ref name="balibatik"/&gt;

===Malaysia===
[[File:Malaysian Batik.jpg|thumb|A batik craftsman making batik. [[Malaysian batik]] are usually patterned with floral motifs with light colouring.]]
{{main article|Malaysian batik}}
Batik was mentioned in the 17th century [[Malay Annals]]. The legend goes when [[Laksamana Hang Nadim]] was ordered by [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]] King, Sultan Mahmud, to sail to India to buy 140 pieces of ''serasah'' cloth (batik) with 40 types of flowers depicted on each. Unable to find any that fulfilled the requirements explained to him, he made up his own. On his return unfortunately his ship sank and he only managed to bring four pieces, earning displeasure from the Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dewan sastra| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYVkAAAAMAAJ| year=2001| publisher=Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society: 1952| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZlhAAAAMAAJ|year=1953 | publisher=The Branch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Today, [[Malaysian batik]] can be found on the east coast of Malaysia such as om [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]] and [[Pahang]], while batik in [[Johor]] clearly shows [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Sumatra]]n influences since there are a large number of Javanese and Sumatran immigrants in southern Malaysia.{{cn|date=May 2014}}--&gt;

The method of Malaysian batik making is different from those of Indonesian Javanese batik, the pattern being larger and simpler with only occasional use of the ''canting'' to create intricate patterns. It relies heavily on [[brush]] painting to apply colours&lt;!--colors or resist? If it's colours, then this is not a batik technique--&gt; to fabrics. The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than deep coloured Javanese batik. The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian batik often displays plants and flowers to avoid the interpretation of human and animal images as idolatry, in accordance with local Islamic doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/figs/hd_figs.htm|title=Figural Representation in Islamic Art|work=metmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the butterfly theme is a common exception.&lt;!-- The Malaysian batik is also famous for its geometrical designs, such as spirals.{{cn|date=May 2014}}--&gt;

===India===
Indians are known to use resist method of printing designs on cotton fabrics, which can be traced back 2000 years. Initially, wax and even rice starch were used for printing on fabrics. Until recently batik was made only for dresses and tailored garments, but modern batik is applied in numerous items, such as murals, wall hangings, paintings, household linen, and scarves, with livelier and brighter patterns.&lt;ref name="charan"/&gt; Contemporary batik making in India is also done by the Deaf women of [[Delhi]], these women are fluent in [[Indian Sign Language]] and also work in other vocational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Burch, Susan |author2=Kaferq, Alison | title=Deaf and Disability Studies | year=2010 | publisher=GU Press | location=Washington D.C | isbn=1-56368-464-0 | page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portuguese merchants"&gt; and --&gt;Over the past century, batik making in Sri Lanka has become firmly established. The Sri Lankan batik industry is a small scale industry which can employ individual design talent and mainly deals with foreign customers for profit. It is now the most visible of the island's crafts with galleries and factories, large and small, having sprung up in many tourist areas. Rows of small stalls selling batiks can be found all along [[Hikkaduwa]]'s Galle Road strip. [[Mahawewa Divisional Secretariat|Mahawewa]], on the other hand, is famous for its batik factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.lanka.com/about/interests/sri-lankan-batik/ | title=Sri Lankan Batik Textiles | publisher=Lakpura Travels | accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SundayObserver&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2012/06/10/fea05.asp | title=Brighter future for batik industry | publisher=Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka) | date=10 June 2012 | accessdate=1 May 2014 | author=Kannangara, Ananda | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502003257/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2012/06/10/fea05.asp | archivedate=2 May 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
Batik is done by the ethnic people in the South-West of China. The [[Miao people|Miao]], [[Bouyei people|Bouyei]] and [[Gejia people]] use a dye resist method for their traditional costumes. The traditional costumes are made up of decorative fabrics, which they achieve by pattern weaving and wax resist. Almost all the Miao decorate hemp and cotton by applying hot wax then dipping the cloth in an indigo dye. The cloth is then used for skirts, panels on jackets, aprons and baby carriers. Like the Javanese, their traditional patterns also contain symbolism, the patterns include the dragon, phoenix, and flowers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.batikguild.org.uk/historyChina.asp, Batik in China]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905031019/http://www.batikguild.org.uk/historyChina.asp%2C |date=5 September 2011  }} The Batik Guild, 1999
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
In Africa, where batik was originally imported by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] merchants from [[Indonesia]] (then the [[Netherlands East Indies]]), paste made from starch or mud is used as a resist instead of wax. The most developed resist-dyeing skills are to be found in Nigeria where the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] make [[Adire (textile art)|adire]] cloths. Two methods of resist are used: ''adire eleso'' which involves tied and stitched designs and ''adire eleko'' that uses starch paste. The paste is most often made from cassava starch, rice, and other ingredients boiled together to produce a smooth thick paste. The Yoruba of West Africa use cassava paste as a resist while the [[Soninke people|Soninke]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] people in Senegal uses rice paste. The Bamana people of Mali use mud as a resist.&lt;ref name="BGAfrica"/&gt;

Although designed to be a [[chair]], due to its amorphous nature it is often confused with [[Tuffet|tuffets]] and [[Ottoman (furniture)|ottomans]].

== History ==
'''Sacco''',&lt;ref name="Vitra Design Museum"/&gt; the first artifact of that kind, was introduced in 1968 by three Italian designers: Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro.&lt;ref name="Vitra Design Museum"/&gt; The object was created in the Italian Modernism movement.&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"&gt;{{cite book |last=Raizman |first=David |editor-last=May |editor-first=Susie |title=History of Modern Design Second Edition |publisher=Laurence King Publishing |date=2010 |pages=256–306 |chapter=Part V: Humanism and Luxury: International Modernism and Mass Culture after Word War II (1945-1960) |isbn=978-1-85669-694-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Being a post war era phenomenon, Italian modernism’s design was highly inspired with new available technology. Post war technology allowed an increase in the processes of production, by introducing new materials such as polystyrene. The idea of mass-produced goods made within an inexpensive price range appealed to consumers. It therefore created the need for a revolution in the creative and manufacturing process. ‘The designer was an integral member of a process that included marketing as well as engineering’ (Raizman 284).&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"/&gt; The inspiration left by Corradino D’Ascano’s [[Vespa]] design for the [[Piaggio]] Corporation in 1946, added value to the essence of the designer. With successful designs, brands could sell more products, and therefore the identity of the designer played an important advertising role.&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"/&gt;
Another important figure of the Italian modernism period was [[Gio Ponti]]. Inspired by modernism's art movements, Ponti created new forms of objects. His asymmetrically balanced designs freed the Italian objects form their classic representations. The designer promoted Italian designs on famous exhibitions called ‘Milan [[Triennale]]’ :  “These exhibitions, organized as early as the 1920s … were responsible for increasing the visibility of Italian design in an international setting ” (Raizman 285).&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"/&gt; After becoming an editor of the [[Domus (magazine)]] in 1947, Ponti contributed to not only Italian design of that time, but also : “the human and creative element in modern industrial design as well as its practical, economic and social benefits.”(Raizman 285)&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"/&gt;

Piero Gatti, Cesare Paolini and Franco Teodoro, inspired by their designer predecessors, came up in 1968 with the design of Sacco the ‘shapeless chair’. Although it was not the first design of an amorphous chair in Italian history, Sacco was the first successful product created in partnership with [[Zanotta (company)|Zanotta]]. The predecessor of the product had a major design flaw of not being able to sustain its form and therefore never reached production. Sacco picked up that flaw and with the use of leather for exterior and right placed stitching. It is worth mentioning that the use of leather was not coincidental as at that time the textile was an Italian national pride product.&lt;ref name="Raizman 2010 256–306"/&gt; The target user of the chair was the lax, hippie community and their non-conformist household. "In an era characterized by the hippie culture, apartment sharing and student demonstrations, the thirty-something designers created a nonpoltrona (non-chair) and thus launched an attack on good bourgeois taste."&lt;ref name="Vitra Design Museum"/&gt;

==Other bean bag chair products inspired by Sacco==
Other designers have followed the ‘shapeless’ chair design, creating a range of inspired products that take after Sacco.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/02/beanbag-chair-make-your-own# | title=How to bag a beanbag chair | publisher=The Guardian | date=2 June 2009 | accessdate=10 January 2014 | author=Griffiths, Sally}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst many, the most successful contemporary model would be [[Jukka Setala]]’s Fatboy. The product launched in 2002 brought the Finnish designer global recognition. The new form of the bean bag chair has less stitching and a more geometrical take in the means of shape. It also has (just like ALL bean bags) an [[Expanded polystyrene|EPS]] filling which is more durable than [[PVC]] that hardly anyone use.&lt;ref name="Fatboy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatboy.com/nl/bean-bags/original# |title=Fatboy original |publisher=Fatboy |date=2002 |accessdate=16 October 2014 |author=Fatboy }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bishop Lloyd's House''' (or '''Bishop Lloyd's Palace''') is at 41&amp;nbsp;Watergate Street, and 51/53&amp;nbsp;Watergate Row, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England. It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376439|desc= Number 41 street numbers 51 and 53 Row Bishop Lloyds House, Chester|access-date= 8 April 2012|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architectural historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] considered it to be "perhaps the best" house in Chester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Pevsner | first =Nikolaus | authorlink =Nikolaus Pevsner | last2 = Hubbard | first2 = Edward | author2-link=Edward Hubbard | series= The Buildings of England| title = Cheshire |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]]| year =2003| origyear=1971| location =New Haven and London| page = 169| isbn =0-300-09588-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house is built on two stone [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] [[undercroft]]s with [[timber framing]] above. Its first floor incorporates a section of the [[Chester Rows]]. The house is now used as shops and meeting rooms and it includes the headquarters of Chester Civic Trust.

==History==

The house originated as two town houses which were built on medieval undercrofts. It was rebuilt during the 17th&amp;nbsp;century when the two buildings were converted into one.  The rebuilt house broke with the medieval fashion of having the main residential accommodation in a great hall at the row level; instead the principal living accommodation was in two "elegant chambers" in the floor above the row.  The house has been associated with [[George Lloyd (bishop of Chester)|George Lloyd]], who was [[Bishop of Chester]] from 1605 to 1615.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  In the early 18th&amp;nbsp;century the east (left) house bore a panel inscribed "EDGAR'S ACADEMY".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.virtualchester.org/view/view_image.php?id=114| title = Bishop Lloyd's Palace, c. 1728| accessdate = 18 July 2009| publisher = Chester City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 19th&amp;nbsp;century it had become run down, the carvings on its frontage had been covered with plaster, the house had been split into [[Apartment building|tenements]], and it was becoming derelict.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{Citation | last = Morris| first = Richard| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | publication-date = | date = | year = 1993| title = The Buildings of Chester| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = Dover|  publisher = Alan Sutton| page = 21| isbn = 0-7509-0255-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1890s the house was heavily restored by [[Thomas Meakin Lockwood|Thomas Lockwood]].  He re-fronted the east house to more closely match the west house and added a flight of steps from the street to the level of the row on the east side.  He also re-positioned the posts holding the structure above the row&lt;ref name=images/&gt; and replaced the 18th-century [[sash window]]s with [[mullion]]ed windows.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt; A further restoration was carried out between 1973 and 1977.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;
[[File:Rayner Watergate.jpg|thumb|alt=A street in the 19th century with buildings on the left, the first of which is timber-framed and highly decorated. In front of the house is a horse and cart|Bishop Lloyd's House before&lt;br&gt;[[Thomas Meakin Lockwood|Lockwood's]] restoration]]

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
The building has the appearance of two houses, each under a [[gable]], with three storeys, and an attic in each gable.  At the street level the east (left) house has a stone staircase with a [[wrought iron]] railing.  At the row level is an oak handrail on [[baluster]]s, behind which is a shop front.  The [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]] supporting the storey above are carved with bearded giants, beasts and an owl; there are also lighter brackets shaped as figures. On the outside, between the beam over the row and the windows above are ten square panels.  The windows are divided into three bays by oak [[pilaster]]s carved in [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] style, and further divided in each bay by two [[mullion]]s and two [[transom (architectural)|transom]]s making a total of 27.  Above the windows is a plaster band and in the attic is a three-light window surrounded by more square panels.  The [[bargeboard]]s have carved [[cornice]]s with an ornate post between them.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;
[[File:Bishop Lloyd Row.jpg|thumb|alt=An elevated covered walkway with the fronts of premises on the right and posts and railings overlooking the street on the left|[[Chester Rows|Row]] in front of Bishop Lloyd's House in 2008 showing the walkway and stallboard]]
The ground floor of the west house includes a shop with a central entrance.  On each side are two [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] and an 18-light [[bow window]]. At the row level is a wooden balustrade, and brackets with carvings similar to the east house.  Above this level are eight recessed carved panels.  The two centre panels contain the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|coat of arms]] of [[James I of England|James&amp;nbsp;I]] with an inscription, and the [[Coat of arms|arms]] of [[Diocese of Sodor and Man|Sodor and Man]] (George Lloyd was [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]] before he became Bishop of Chester) with the date 1615.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;  To the left of these are three panels containing carvings of [[Adam and Eve]], [[Cain and Abel]], and [[Binding of Isaac|Abraham and Isaac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Ward | first =Simon | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Chester: A History |edition= | publisher =Phillimore | year = 2009 | location =Chichester | page = 62|  isbn =978-1-86077-499-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To the right are another three panels, two of which contain carvings of [[Bible|biblical]] scenes.  In the storey above are four oak pilasters dividing the windows into three bays, with two mullions and a transom further separating the windows - of which there is a total of 18.  Above the windows is a carved beam and over this are ten arched panels which contain carvings of [[heraldry|heraldic]] beasts.  In the attic is a three-light window to each side of which are three panels containing carvings, and above the window are three plain panels.  Again the bargeboards are carved with a post between them.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

===Interior===
The two undercrofts have walls of red [[sandstone]] [[rubble]], with brick [[barrel vault]]s which were probably added in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;  Leading from the row level to the third storey is a [[Thomas Chippendale|Chinese Chippendale]] staircase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hartwell | first = Clare |last2 = Hyde | first2 = Matthew |last3 = Hubbard | first3 = Edward | author3-link=Edward Hubbard | last4 =Pevsner | first4 =Nikolaus | author4-link =Nikolaus Pevsner | series= The Buildings of England| title = Cheshire |edition= | publisher =[[Yale University Press]]| year =2011| origyear=1971| location =New Haven and London| pages = 265–266|  isbn =978-0-300-17043-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the third storey are two rooms.  The larger room has an ornate 17th-century plaster ceiling and a massive fireplace; it is thought that these were moved from the Bishop's Palace in Abbey Square after this was damaged in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]].  The smaller room also has a plaster ceiling, less ornate than in the other room.  This includes motifs including [[Tudor rose]]s, horses, and starfish.  Around the room is a [[frieze]] containing sea-monsters.  In this room is a smaller fireplace in the [[Fireplace mantel|overmantel]] of which is a carving of [[Cupid]] riding on a lion.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.virtualchester.org/view/view_location.php?id=30| title = Bishop Lloyd's Palace| accessdate = 16 July 2009| publisher = Chester City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==

There are shops on the ground floor level and at the level of the row. The house above is open free of charge to visitors at advertised times. It has two large meeting rooms which are available to hire.&lt;ref name=cct&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.chestercivictrust.org.uk/blp/| title = Hire Bishop Lloyd's Palace| accessdate = 16 February 2011| publisher = Chester Civic Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building contains the headquarters of the Chester Civic Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.chestercivictrust.org.uk/| title = The Chester Civic Trust Organisation | accessdate = 16 February 2011| publisher = Chester Civic Trust }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15161">[[File:Parmigianino 004.jpg|thumb|''[[Madonna with the Long Neck]]'', by [[Parmigianino]]. As in other [[Mannerist]] works, the proportions of the body - here the [[neck]] - are exaggerated for artistic effect.]]
While there is significant variation in anatomical proportions between people, there are many references to '''body proportions''' that are intended to be canonical, either in [[art]], [[measurement]], or [[medicine]].

In [[measurement]], body proportions are often used to relate two or more measurements based on the body.  A [[cubit]], for instance, is supposed to be six [[palm (unit)|palms]]. A [[span (unit)|span]] is taken to be 9 inches and was previously considered as half a cubit. While convenient, these ratios may not reflect the physiognomic variation of the individuals using them.

Similarly, in [[art]], body proportions are the study of relation of [[human body|human]] or animal body parts to each other and to the whole.  These ratios are used in depictions of the figure (to varying degrees naturalistic, idealized or stylized), and may become part of an [[aesthetic canon]] within a culture.

==Basics of human proportions==
[[Image:Braus 1921 1.png|thumb|upright=0.6&lt;!--size for very long image--&gt;|Human proportions marked out in an illustration from a 20th-century anatomy text-book. Hermann Braus, 1921]]
[[Image:Braus 1921 3.png|300px|thumb|upright|A) [[black lemur]]&lt;br&gt;B) chimpanzee&lt;br&gt;C) gorilla&lt;br&gt; D) human]]
It is important in [[figure drawing]] to draw the human figure in proportion. Though there are subtle differences between individuals, human proportions fit within a fairly standard range, though artists have historically tried to create idealised standards, which have varied considerably over different periods and regions. In modern figure drawing, the basic unit of measurement is the 'head', which is the distance from the top of the head to the chin. This unit of measurement is reasonably standard, and has long been used by artists to establish the proportions of the human figure.  [[Ancient Egyptian art]] used a canon of proportion based on the "fist", measured across the knuckles, with 18 fists from the ground to the hairline on the forehead.  This was already established by the [[Narmer Palette]] from about the 31st century BC, and remained in use until at least the conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] some 3,000 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W. Stevenson, and Simpson, William Kelly. ''The Art and Architecture of Ancient Egypt'', pp. 12-13 and note 17, 3rd edn. 1998, Yale University Press (Penguin/Yale History of Art), {{ISBN|0300077475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proportions used in figure drawing are:{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

* An average person is generally 7-and-a-half heads tall (including the head).
* An ideal figure, used when aiming for an impression of nobility or grace, is drawn at 8 heads tall.
* A [[heroic]] figure, used in the heroic for the depiction of [[gods]] and [[superheroes]], is eight-and-a-half heads tall.  Most of the additional length comes from a bigger chest and longer legs.

===Leg-to-body ratio===

A study using Polish participants by Sorokowski found 5% longer legs than an individual used as a reference was considered most attractive.&lt;ref name=tws19jan&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.09.002 |title=Adaptive preferences for leg length in a potential partner |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=86–91 |year=2008 |last1=Sorokowski |first1=Piotr |last2=Pawlowski |first2=Boguslaw }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded this preference might stem from the influence of leggy runway models.&lt;ref name="Sorokowski"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09709274.2010.11906309 |title=Attractiveness of Legs Length in Poland and Great Britain |journal=Journal of Human Ecology |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=145 |year=2017 |last1=Sorokowski |first1=Piotr }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sorokowski study was criticized for using a picture of the same person with digitally altered leg lengths which Marco Bertamini{{who|date=March 2016}} felt were unrealistic.&lt;ref name="Bertamini" /&gt;

Another study using British and American participants, found ''mid-ranging'' leg-to-body ratios to be most ideal.&lt;ref name="Frederick"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2009.09.001 |pmid=19822462 |title=The influence of leg-to-body ratio (LBR) on judgments of female physical attractiveness: Assessments of computer-generated images varying in LBR |journal=Body Image |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=51–5 |year=2010 |last1=Frederick |first1=David A |last2=Hadji-Michael |first2=Maria |last3=Furnham |first3=Adrian |last4=Swami |first4=Viren }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Swami et al. of American men and women showed a preference for men with legs as long as the rest of their body and women with 40%{{clarify|date=March 2016}} longer legs than the rest of their body&lt;ref name="Swami"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2006.08.003 |pmid=18089235 |title=The leg-to-body ratio as a human aesthetic criterion |journal=Body Image |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=317–23 |year=2006 |last1=Swami |first1=Viren |last2=Einon |first2=Dorothy |last3=Furnham |first3=Adrian }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researcher concluded that this preference might be influenced by American culture where long-legged women are portrayed as more attractive.&lt;ref name="Swami" /&gt; The Swami et al. study was criticized for using a picture of the same person with digitally altered leg lengths which Marco Bertamini felt were unrealistic.&lt;ref name="Bertamini"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0099320 |title=The effect of leg length on perceived attractiveness of simplified stimuli |journal=Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=233–50 |year=2009 |last1=Bertamini |first1=Marco |last2=Bennett |first2=Kate M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bertamini also criticized the Swami study for only changing the leg length while keeping the arm length constant.&lt;ref name="Bertamini" /&gt; Bertamini's own study which used stick figures mirrored Swami's study, however, by finding a preference for leggier women.&lt;ref name="Bertamini" /&gt;

Another common measurement of related to leg-to-body ratio is sitting-height ratio (SHR). Sitting height ratio is the ratio of the head plus spine length to total height which is highly correlated to leg-to-body ratio. SHR has been found to be very different between individuals of different ancestry. It has been reported that individuals with African ancestry have on average longer leg length, i.e. lower SHR than individuals of European ancestry.&lt;ref name="LegLengthBeauty"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bogin | first1 = B. | last2 = Varela-Silva | first2 = MI | date = Mar 2010 | title = Leg length, body proportion, and health: a review with a note on beauty | url = | journal = Int J Environ Res Public Health | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 1047–75 | doi=10.3390/ijerph7031047 | pmid=20617018 | pmc=2872302}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2015 revealed that this difference is mainly due to genetic differences and the SHR difference between African and European individuals is as large as 1 standard deviation.&lt;ref name="SHR"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.02.018 |pmid=25865494 |pmc=4570286 |title=Genome-wide Analysis of Body Proportion Classifies Height-Associated Variants by Mechanism of Action and Implicates Genes Important for Skeletal Development |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=96 |issue=5 |pages=695–708 |year=2015 |last1=Chan |first1=Yingleong |last2=Salem |first2=Rany M |last3=Hsu |first3=Yu-Han H |last4=McMahon |first4=George |last5=Pers |first5=Tune H |last6=Vedantam |first6=Sailaja |last7=Esko |first7=Tonu |last8=Guo |first8=Michael H |last9=Lim |first9=Elaine T |last10=Franke |first10=Lude |last11=Smith |first11=George Davey |last12=Strachan |first12=David P |last13=Hirschhorn |first13=Joel N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muscle men and thin women===
A 1999 study found that "the (action) figures have grown much more muscular over time, with many contemporary figures far exceeding the muscularity of even the largest human bodybuilders," reflecting an American cultural ideal of a super muscular man.&lt;ref name="Pope"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pope|first=Harrison|author2=Roberto Olivardia|author3=Amanda Gruber|author4=John Borowiecki|date=1998-05-26|title=Evolving Ideals of Male Body Image as Seen Through Action Toys|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc|volume=26|issue=1|doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-108x(199907)26:1&lt;65::aid-eat8&gt;3.3.co;2-4|pmid=10349585|pages=65–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, female dolls reflect the cultural ideal of thinness in women.&lt;ref name="Pope" /&gt;

The ancient Greek sculptor [[Polykleitos]] (c.450–420 BC), known for his ideally proportioned bronze ''[[Doryphoros]]'', wrote an influential ''Canon'' describing the proportions to be followed in sculpture.&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Andrew |title=Polykleitos of Argos," One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works |journal=Journal of Hellenic Studies |date=November 1978 |volume=98 |pages=122–131 |doi=10.2307/630196|jstor=630196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''Canon'' applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and ''symmetria'' (Greek for "harmonious proportions") creating a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous [[geometric series|geometric progressions]]. Polykleitos uses the [[distal phalanges|distal phalanx]] of the [[little finger]] as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body, scaling this length up repeatedly by {{radic|2}} to obtain the ideal size of the other phalanges, the hand, forearm, and upper arm in turn.&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{cite journal| author=Tobin, Richard | title=The ''Canon'' of Polykleitos | journal=American Journal of Archaeology | volume=79 | issue=4 | date=October 1975 | pages=307–321 | doi=10.2307/503064| jstor=503064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] believed that the ideal human proportions were determined by the harmonious proportions that he believed governed the universe,&lt;ref name="DaVinci"&gt;"Universal Leonardo: Leonardo Da Vinci Online › Essays." Universal Leonardo: Leonardo Da Vinci Online › Welcome to Universal Leonardo. Web. 22 Apr. 2010. &lt;http://www.universalleonardo.org/essays.php?id=563&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; such that the ideal man would fit cleanly into a circle as depicted in his famed drawing of ''[[Vitruvian man]]''.&lt;ref name="DaVinci" /&gt;

A '''bone folder''', '''bonefolder''', or '''folding bone''' is a dull-edged [[hand tool]] used to fold and crease material in crafts such as [[bookbinding]],&lt;ref name="BBandP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KSmithvol1"/&gt; [[cardmaking]],&lt;ref name="greetcardencl"/&gt; [[origami]],&lt;ref name="Smith2004"/&gt; and other paper crafts &lt;!-- PLEASE do not link [[papercraft]]; it has a specialized, more limited meaning --&gt; that require a sharp crease or fold. The tool was also used when correspondence by letter writing was more formal and an art.

Often made from the [[leg bone]] of a cow, deer, or similar animal and ivory.&lt;ref name="RandEManual"/&gt; Alternatives made from [[plastic]] now exist; however, those made from bone may be less likely to leave residue on the workpiece.&lt;ref name="inhousebookbinding"/&gt;

In Japan, the equivalent folding tool is traditionally made from [[bamboo]], although alternatives include a Japanese fabric marking tool (''hera'') and a Western bone folder.&lt;ref name="Japanesebookbinding"/&gt;

'''''Bouquet with Flying Lovers''''' is a painting by [[Marc Chagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/chagall-bouquet-with-flying-lovers-n05804 |title='Bouquet with Flying Lovers', Marc Chagall |publisher=[[Tate Gallery]] |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is oil on canvas.

According to Chagall himself, he started working on the painting in the 1930s when he lived in [[Paris]], and he finished the work when he was mourning the death of his wife Bella. The image is predominantly blue and shows a bouquet of flowers in the center. Above the flowers, two lovers float in the air. An [[angel]] enters through the window. The buildings on the right side depict [[Vitebsk]], Chagall's birth village.

Membership is limited to associations which require their members to adhere to extremely strict quality and expertise standards. Dealers who are affiliated with CINOA through their art and antique trade associations often display the CINOA logo as support of the CINOA charter and guidelines.

The stated goals of CINOA are to:
* Encourage high ethical standards within the trade
* Disseminate practical information on the art market
* Facilitate legitimate circulation of artworks throughout the world

Since 1976, CINOA has been awarding a yearly [[CINOA Prize]] to art historians or major art market players "in recognition of an academic publication or a remarkable contribution to furthering the cultural preservation through art works in a CINOA member country".&lt;ref&gt;CINOA, [http://www.cinoa.org/index.pl?id=2218;isa=Category;op=show "The CINOA Prize"] (page retrieved November 24th, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1854 as the Lambeth School of Art,&lt;ref&gt;[https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib2_1207870826 University of Glasgow Mapping Sculpture Project]&lt;/ref&gt; the '''City and Guilds of London Art School''' is a small specialist [[art college]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://london.floodlight.co.uk/london/courses-classes-lessons/city-and-guilds-of-london-art-school/subject/qualification/study/lambeth/16180339/220706/100/12975/domain.html College listed age in http://london.floodlight.co.uk (accessed 5 April 2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202154904/http://london.floodlight.co.uk/london/courses-classes-lessons/city-and-guilds-of-london-art-school/subject/qualification/study/lambeth/16180339/220706/100/12975/domain.html |date=2 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; located in central London, England. Originally founded as a government art school,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Macdonald, ''The History and Philosophy of Art Education'' (Cambridge: Lutterworth Press, 2004) p.383&lt;/ref&gt; it is now an independent, not-for-profit charity, and is one of the country's longest established art schools. It offers courses ranging from art and design [[Foundation Course|Foundation]], through to BA (Hons) [[undergraduate degree]]s and MA [[postgraduate education|postgraduate]] courses in [[fine art]] and conservation. In addition, it offers the only diploma and [[postgraduate diploma]] courses in Britain in historic stone and wood carving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/courses Courses listed on school's website (accessed 25 March 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202192337/http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/courses |date=2 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art School is housed in a row of [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] buildings in London's [[Kennington]] district,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geraldlaing.com/index.php/articles/articles_full/city_and_guilds_of_london_art_school/ Artist describes location at www.geraldlaing.com (accessed on 5 April 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in an adjoining converted warehouse building close to the south bank of the river [[Thames]].

==History==
===Foundation in the 19th Century===
The City and Guilds of London Art School was founded in 1854 by the Reverend Robert Gregory under the name Lambeth School of Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcollectorsnet.com/magazine/issue19/iss19p5.html www.worldcollectorsnet.com describes  potter John Sparkes leading the college in 1856 (accessed 5 April 2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605234647/http://www.worldcollectorsnet.com/magazine/issue19/iss19p5.html |date=5 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as a night school in rooms occupied during the day by a [[National school (England and Wales)|National School]] in his south London parish of St Mary the Less. With the support of [[Henry Cole]] Director of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], who supplied Gregory with teachers, the school flourished and became a leader in the provision of instruction in applied art and design to working artisans, many of whom were employed by local manufacturing firms, including [[Royal Doulton|Doulton's]] and [[Farmer and Brindley]]. The rapid expansion of the school led to the need for new premises, and in 1860 [[Edward VII|Albert, Prince of Wales (Edward VII)]] laid the foundation stone for new premises in Millers Lane, built on the site of the [[Vauxhall Gardens]] as part of a redevelopment that included St Peter's church. The buildings are still standing, although the road is now called St Oswald's Place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southwark.anglican.org/parishes/265p Streatham, St Peter - Lambeth, South Deanery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227134625/http://www.southwark.anglican.org/parishes/265p |date=27 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sculp&gt;{{cite web|title=South London Technical School of Art (also Lambeth School of Art and City and Guilds of London Art School)|url=http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/organization.php?id=msib2_1207870826|website=Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851-1951|publisher=Glasgow University, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Henry Moore Institute|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development under John Sparkes===
In 1857 [[John Charles Lewis Sparkes]] started teaching at the art school, soon becoming its Headmaster. Under Sparkes City and Guilds of London Art School was at the forefront of opposition to the monopoly claimed by the Royal Academy of Arts on the teaching of fine art practices, particularly drawing from the human figure. An attempt had been made to resolve this conflict in 1852, with the introduction by the British Government of the National Course on Instruction for art and design education, which was in effect a [[national curriculum]] for art training. This allowed for some elements of drawing to be taught, but within a broader curriculum that stressed the teaching of techniques to aid workers in artisan manufacturing industries rather than the training of artists.

In the case of City and Guilds of London Art School it was suggested at the time that Sparkes was ignoring the National Course on Instruction and teaching his students to be fine artists, particularly in 1865, when students from the art school won three medals at the annual awards handed out by the Royal Academy of Arts,&lt;ref&gt;The Athenaeum, vol. 1991, 23 December 1965, p.894&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1867 when its students won three out of ten of the gold medals for art awarded by the Government, along with four silver medals awarded annually by the Royal Academy of Arts, and a bronze medal at the International Exposition held that year in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;'Lambeth School of Art' in ''The Art Journal,'' February 1866, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly Sparkes and his colleagues at City and Guilds of London Art School ignored the general prohibition on life drawing being taught outside the Royal Academy of Arts, and the success of Sparkes's students at City and Guilds of London Art School in fine art competitions can be traced to this willingness by Sparkes to ignore regulations he believed were wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Macdonald, ''The History and Philosophy of Art Education'' (Cambridge, James Clarke and Co Ltd, 2014) .p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

This radicalism in Sparkes can also be seen in his concern for the art and design tutors working both at City and Guilds of London Art School and elsewhere in Britain. In the 1860s a block grant was give by the British Government to the [[Royal College of Art|South Kensington Government School of Design]] for teachers' pay and this was then redistributed to other art schools across the country. As well as being widely considered an insufficient sum in the first place, the Government School of Design was accused by people such as Sparkes of holding on to too much of the money leading to the payment of what were called starvation wages at other art schools. Sparkes in particular was instrumental in campaigning for an increase in these wages, through both direct appeals to parliament and the establishment of the first national union of art teachers, the Association of Art Masters, in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Macdonald, ''The History and Philosophy of Art Education'' (Cambridge, James Clarke and Co Ltd, 2014) .p.216&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connection to Doulton's Pottery===
Recognising the limitations of government patronage of art schools, Sparkes cultivated a number of connections between the City and Guilds of London Art School and local manufacturing industries which would lead ultimately to City and Guilds of London Art School attaining the independent status it has today. One of the most notable of these was with [[Henry Doulton]] whose pottery factory, later known as [[Royal Doulton]], was located near to the City and Guilds of London Art School. 

In 1863 Doulton joined the school's board of management and the following year he gave the school its first commission, for a terracotta frieze for his factory's new extension. Following on from this Doulton was a strong supporter and promoter of the art school's activities, including exhibiting experimental works by students at the [[1867 Paris Exhibition]] and at the [[Annual International Exhibitions (London 1871–74)|1871 London Exhibition]].&lt;ref name=dick&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wardleworth|first1=Dennis|title=William Reid Dick, Sculptor|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Farnham, Surrey|isbn=9781409439714|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9oJmPfmQ7SgC&amp;dq|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1869, Doulton and his staff helped the art school to develop a curriculum that trained students for the pottery trade, and to carry out design work for Doulton. This collaboration provided [[Royal Doulton|Doulton's]] with a supply of higher-quality artwork for its trade, and gave students at Lambeth School of Art employment opportunities, and many noted English modellers and sculptors of the late nineteenth century owe their careers to this partnership.&lt;ref name=sculp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKeown|first1=Julie|title=Royal Doulton|date=1997|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=0747803382|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxBdYICh0cwC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The close connection between the art school and Doulton's meant that the ethos of City and Guilds of London School of Art was based, from very early days, on a belief in a strong connection between the fine arts, craft and design. Consequently, its students and teachers became associated with the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and to some extent the [[Art Nouveau]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline College timeline at www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk (accessed 8 March 2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228232823/http://cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline |date=28 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connection to Mssrs Farmer and Brindley===
In addition to Doulton's, Sparkes also cultivated contacts with other local craft trade companies, one of the most notable of which was Mssrs Farmer and Brindley, a Lambeth-based architectural stone carving and terra-cotta company.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Hardy, 'Farmer and Brindley, Craftsmen and Sculptors, 1850-1930' in The Victorian Society Annual 1993, p. 4-17&lt;/ref&gt; As with Doulton's, a number of apprentices at Farmer and Brindley augmented their training with study at the Art School. This included the sculptors Charles John Allen (1862-1956), Harry Bates (1850-1899) and Nathaniel Hitch (1846-1936), and others, who became prominent sculptors in the Victorian and Edwardian periods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/search/index.php?searchtype=all&amp;search=farmer+and+brindley&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 University of Glasgow Mapping Sculpture Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

===City and Guilds Institute and City Livery Companies===
In 1879 Sparkes secured the involvement in the art school of the newly founded [[City and Guilds of London Institute]], which received financial backing from 16 [[Livery Companies]].&lt;ref name=dick/&gt; The new backing secured the financial future of the school without the strings attached to government funding. Under the new arrangement, the art school moved to a new building in Kennington Park Road, which it still occupies, and Lambeth School of Art was renamed the South London Technical School of Art. In 1937 it changed its name to the City and Guilds of London Art School, reflecting the historical and continued support of the city of London [[Livery Companies]].&lt;ref name=sculp/&gt;

===20th and 21st centuries===

Graduates of the Art School were involved in some of the leading social and political movements of the early twentieth century, including [[Clemence Housman]] and [[Laurence Housman]], who co-founded, in 1909, a society for artists who supported the [[Suffragette Movement]], called the [[Suffrage Atelier]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Crawford, ''The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide 1866-1928'' (London: Routledge, 1999) p.662&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurence Housman]] later went on to found the alternative bookshop, which still bears his name, located in Caledonian Road, near London's [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] railway station.

After the Second World War, new restoration and carving courses were established at the Art School to train people for the restoration of London's war-damaged buildings. However, during the 1960s the art school also developed a [[fine art]] programme, although it still maintained and strengthened its programmes in restoration and carving. This resulted in the Art School evolving into both a school for fine art education, and a unique specialist training centre for the education of restorers and conservators of architectural stone and wood work. 

In 1970 the Art School became an independent charitable trust, with the new Deed of Incorporation signed by Goeffrey Agnew (chairman of the art gallery [[Thomas Agnew &amp; Sons]]), Sir Colin Skelton Anderson (Provost of the [[Royal College of Art]]), [[Sir John Betjeman]] (poet), [[Adrian Maurice Daintrey]] (artist), Gilbert Samuel (Lord Mayor of London), [[Charles Wheeler (sculptor)|Charles Wheeler]] (sculptor and Former President of the [[Royal Academy]]), and [[Carel Weight]] (artist), amongst others. Support also came from artists such as [[Henry Moore]] and [[Graham Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;Companies House, London, Articles of Association, reference no. 00992490&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 and 1998 the Fine Art Painting, Sculpture and Conservation courses were validated at undergraduate BA (Hons) level. In 2000 the MA course in Fine Art was validated by the University of Central England (now [[Birmingham City University]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biad.bcu.ac.uk/about/associatedcolleges.htm Birmingham Institute of Art and Design validation at www.biad.bcu.ac.uk (accessed 5 March 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:CIty and Guilds of London Art School.JPG|thumb|Exterior at twilight]]

In a 2008 letter to the [[Observer (newspaper)|Observer]] newspaper and [[Art Monthly]] by Graham Crowley, former Professor of the Royal College of Art, the City &amp; Guilds of London Art School's Fine Art Department was singled out for its "magnificent job" in "maintaining the transformative power and joy of education through art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/feb/10/art.furthereducation | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Vanessa | last=Thorpe | title=Low morale devastates art colleges | date=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]] shortlisted writer [[Tibor Fischer]] became the [[Royal Literary Fund]] writing fellow at the City and Guilds of London Art School.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rlf.org.uk/fellowshipscheme/current_fellows.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011 the magazine [[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]] surveyed art world professionals to create a list of the top ten British art schools, resulting in the City and Guilds of London Art School coming third after the Royal College of Art and the Royal Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/news/school_news/modern_painters |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228073945/http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/news/school_news/modern_painters |archivedate=28 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2018 art school's undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses have been validated by [[Ravensbourne (college)|Ravensbourne]].

The '''coat of arms of [[Colombia]]''' contains a shield with numerous symbols. Perched on top of the shield is an [[Andean condor]] holding an olive crown and the condor symbolizing freedom. The [[national motto]], ''Libertad y Orden'' (Spanish for ''Liberty and Order''), is on a scroll in between the bird and the shield in black font over golden background. The condor is depicted as displayed (with his wings extended) and looking to the [[dexter and sinister|right]].

==Description==
The [[Flag of Colombia|national flag]] is draped on each side of the shield. The shield is broken into three portions. In the lowermost portion is a depiction of ships, pointing to the maritime history of Colombia, namely to the [[Isthmus of Panama]], which was part of Colombia until 1903. Nowadays represents the two oceans that border the country (Atlantic and Pacific). The sails mean the Colombian commerce with the rest of the world and the rising economy. In the middle section, over a [[field (heraldry)|field]] of silver ([[argent]]), the [[Phrygian cap|Phrygia cap]] is presented; this being a traditional symbol of liberty and freedom. The topmost section contains a [[pomegranate]] over a blue ([[azure (heraldry)|azure]]) field, as a symbol of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|Vice royalty of New Granada]] (early colonial name of Colombia back in the 18th century), in the middle flanked by two ''[[cornucopia]]s'' or horns of plenty: the one at the right with golden and silver coins and the one at the left with tropical fruits. This portion represents the agricultural and mineral wealth of Colombian soil.

The coat of arms of the Republic was designed by [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], and was adopted via Act 3 of May 9, 1834, with later non-essential modifications according to Ordinance 861 of 1924.

==Criticism==
Some critics have argued that the coat of arms is outdated and [[anachronistic]], as the Andean condor is a very threatened species in the country, with barely 100 creatures soaring the landscape. It has also been discussed that the condor is still a vulture and feeds of [[carrion]], making it an animal with a low profile that never hunts its own food. In addition, the Andean condor is also the national bird of [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Chile]]. The pomegranate, being a [[Mediterranean]] fruit, is not currently cultivated in Colombia and the [[Phrygian cap]] is of [[Greek people|Greek]] origin. The [[Isthmus of Panama]], no longer belonging to Colombia, has also been suggested as an element needing changing.

'''Color motion picture film''' refers both to unexposed [[color photography|color photographic film]] in a format suitable for use in a [[Movie camera|motion picture camera]], and to finished motion picture [[film]], ready for use in a [[movie projector|projector]], which bears images in color.

The first color cinematography was by [[additive color]] systems such as the one patented by [[Edward Raymond Turner]] in 1899 and tested in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19598445 "Martin Scorsese on world's first colour film discovery"]. BBC&lt;/ref&gt; A simplified additive system was successfully commercialised in 1909 as [[Kinemacolor]]. These early systems used black-and-white film to photograph and project two or more component images through different color [[filter (optics)|filters]].

Around 1920, the first practical [[subtractive color]] processes were introduced. These also used black-and-white film to photograph multiple color-filtered source images, but the final product was a multicolored print that did not require special projection equipment. Before 1932, when three-strip [[Technicolor]] was introduced, commercialized subtractive processes used only two color components and could reproduce only a limited range of color.

In 1935, [[Kodachrome]] was introduced, followed by [[Agfacolor]] in 1936. They were intended primarily for amateur [[home movies]] and "[[Reversal film|slides]]". These were the first films of the "integral tripack" type, coated with three layers of differently color-sensitive [[Photographic emulsion|emulsion]], which is usually what is meant by the words "color film" as commonly used. The few color films still being made in the 2010s are of this type. The first color [[negative (photography)|negative]] films and corresponding [[release print|print]] films were modified versions of these films. They were introduced around 1940 but only came into wide use for commercial motion picture production in the early 1950s. In the US, [[Eastman Kodak]]'s [[Eastmancolor]] was the usual choice, but it was often re-branded with another trade name, such as "WarnerColor", by the studio or the film processor.

Later color films were standardized into two distinct processes: [[Eastman Color Negative|Eastman Color Negative 2]] chemistry (camera negative stocks, duplicating interpositive and internegative stocks) and [[Eastman Color Positive|Eastman Color Positive 2]] chemistry (positive prints for direct projection), usually abbreviated as ECN-2 and ECP-2. Fuji's products are compatible with ECN-2 and ECP-2.

Film was the dominant form of cinematography until the 2010s, when it was largely replaced by [[digital cinematography]].&lt;ref name="indiewire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/as-studios-abandon-35-mm-film-small-theaters-struggle-to-transition-to-digital|title=Studios Abandon Film, Small Theaters Struggle -- And There's a Happy Ending|website=Indiewire|last1=Hurley|first1=Michael|date=2 January 2014|access-date=5 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201064107/http://www.indiewire.com/article/as-studios-abandon-35-mm-film-small-theaters-struggle-to-transition-to-digital|archive-date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The first motion pictures were photographed using a simple homogeneous [[photographic emulsion]] that yielded a [[black-and-white]] image—that is, an image in shades of gray, ranging from black to white, corresponding to the [[luminous intensity]] of each point on the photographed subject. Light, shade, form and movement were captured, but not color.

With color motion picture film, information about the [[color]] of the light at each image point is also captured. This is done by analyzing the [[visible spectrum]] of color into several regions (normally three, commonly referred to by their dominant colors: red, green and blue) and recording each region separately.

Current color films do this with three layers of differently color-sensitive photographic emulsion coated on one strip of [[film base]]. Early processes used color [[filter (optics)|filters]] to photograph the color components as completely separate images (e.g., three-strip [[Technicolor]]) or adjacent microscopic image fragments (e.g., [[Dufaycolor]]) in a one-layer black-and-white emulsion.

Each photographed color component, initially just a colorless record of the luminous intensities in the part of the spectrum that it captured, is processed to produce a transparent dye image in the color [[complementary color|complementary]] to the color of the light that it recorded. The superimposed dye images combine to synthesize the original colors by the [[subtractive color]] method. In some early color processes (e.g., [[Kinemacolor]]), the component images remained in black-and-white form and were projected through [[color filter]]s to synthesize the original colors by the [[additive color]] method.

==Tinting and hand coloring==
{{see also|List of early color feature films}}
The earliest motion picture stocks were [[orthochromatic]], and recorded blue and green light, but not red. Recording all three spectral regions required making film stock [[panchromatic]] to some degree. Since orthochromatic film stock hindered color photography in its beginnings, the first films with color in them used [[aniline]] dyes to create artificial color. Hand-colored films appeared in 1895 with [[Thomas Edison]]'s hand-painted ''Annabelle's Dance'' for his [[Kinetoscope]] viewers.

Many early filmmakers from the first ten years of film also used this method to some degree. [[George Méliès]] offered hand-painted prints of his own films at an additional cost over the black-and-white versions, including the visual-effects pioneering ''[[Le Voyage dans la Lune|A Trip to the Moon]]'' (1902). The film had various parts of the film painted frame-by-frame by twenty-one women in Montreuil&lt;ref name="history"&gt;David A. Cook, ''A History of Narrative Film'' (2nd edition, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1990).  {{ISBN|0-393-95553-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a production-line method.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;Ira Konigsberg, ''The Complete Film Dictionary'' Meridan PAL Books, 1987)  {{ISBN|0-452-00980-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially successful [[stencil]] color process was introduced in 1905 by [[Pathé Frères]]. ''Pathé Color'', renamed [[Pathéchrome]] in 1929, became one of the most accurate and reliable stencil coloring systems. It incorporated an original print of a film with sections cut by [[pantograph]] in the appropriate areas for up to six colors&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; by a coloring machine with dye-soaked, velvet rollers.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Ephraim Katz, ''The Film Encyclopedia'' (HarperCollins, 1994) {{ISBN|0-06-273089-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a stencil had been made for the whole film, it was placed into contact with the print to be colored and run at high speed (60 feet per minute) through the coloring (staining) machine. The process was repeated for each set of stencils corresponding to a different color. By 1910, Pathé had over 400 women employed as stencilers in their [[Vincennes]] factory.  Pathéchrome continued production through the 1930s.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

A more common technique emerged in the early 1910s known as '''[[film tinting]]''', a process in which either the emulsion or the [[film base]] is dyed, giving the image a uniform [[monochromatic]] color.  This process was popular during the silent era, with specific colors employed for certain narrative effects (red for scenes with fire or firelight, blue for night, etc.).&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

A complementary process, called '''toning''', replaces the [[silver]] particles in the film with metallic salts or [[mordant]]ed [[dye]]s.  This creates a color effect in which the dark parts of the image are replaced with a color (e.g., blue and white rather than black and white).  Tinting and toning were sometimes applied together.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

In the United States, St. Louis engraver Max Handschiegl and cinematographer Alvin Wyckoff created the [[Handschiegl Color Process]], a dye-transfer equivalent of the stencil process, first used in ''[[Joan the Woman]]'' (1917) directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]], and used in special effects sequences for films such as ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925).&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

[[Eastman Kodak]] introduced its own system of pre-tinted black-and-white film stocks called [[Sonochrome]] in 1929.  The Sonochrome line featured films tinted in seventeen different colors including Peachblow, Inferno, Candle Flame, Sunshine, Purple Haze, Firelight, Azure, Nocturne, Verdante, Aquagreen,&lt;ref name="readfilm" /&gt; Caprice, Fleur de Lis, Rose Doree, and the neutral-density Argent, which kept the screen from becoming excessively bright when switching to a black-and-white scene.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Tinting and toning continued to be used well into the sound era.  In the 1930s and 1940s, some western films were processed in a sepia-toning solution to evoke the feeling of old photographs of the day. Tinting was used as late as 1951 for [[Sam Newfield]]'s sci-fi film ''[[Lost Continent (1951 film)|Lost Continent]]'' for the green lost-world sequences. [[Alfred Hitchcock]] used a form of hand-coloring for the orange-red gun-blast at the audience in ''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945).&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  Kodak's Sonochrome and similar pre-tinted stocks were still in production until the 1970s and were used commonly for custom theatrical trailers and [[Snipe (theatrical)|snipes]].

In the last half of the 20th century, [[Norman McLaren]], who was one of the pioneers in animated movies, made several animated films in which he directly hand-painted the images, and in some cases, also the soundtrack, on each frame of the film. This approach was previously employed in the early years of movies, late 19th and early 20th century. One of the precursors in color hand painting frame by frame was the Aragonese Segundo de Chomon, that worked with Melies.

Tinting was gradually replaced by natural color techniques.

==Physics of light and color==
The principles on which [[color photography]] is based were first proposed by Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1855 and presented at the [[Royal Society]] in London in 1861.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  By that time, it was known that [[light]] comprises a spectrum of different wavelengths that are perceived as different colors as they are absorbed and reflected by natural objects.  Maxwell discovered that all natural colors in this spectrum as perceived by the human eye may be reproduced with additive combinations of three [[primary color]]s—[[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]]—which, when mixed equally, produce white light.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Between 1900 and 1935, dozens of natural color systems were introduced, although only a few were successful.&lt;ref name="readfilm"&gt;Monaco, James (1981) (Revised ed) ''How to Read a Film'' Oxford University Press.  {{ISBN|0-19-502806-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additive color===
The first color systems that appeared in motion pictures were [[additive color]] systems.  Additive color was practical because no special color stock was necessary.  Black-and-white film could be processed and used in both filming and projection.  The various additive systems entailed the use of color [[filter (photography)|filters]] on both the movie camera and [[movie projector|projector]].  Additive color adds lights of the primary colors in various proportions to the projected image.  Because of the limited amount of space to record images on film, and later because the lack of a camera that could record more than two strips of film at once, most early motion-picture color systems consisted of two colors, often red and green or red and blue.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

A pioneering three-color additive system was patented in England by [[Edward Raymond Turner]] in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World's first colour moving pictures discovered|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-19423951l|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used a rotating set of red, green and blue filters to photograph the three color components one after the other on three successive [[film frame|frame]]s of [[panchromatic]] black-and-white film. The finished film was projected through similar filters to reconstitute the color. In 1902, Turner shot test footage to demonstrate his system, but projecting it proved problematic because of the accurate registration (alignment) of the three separate color elements required for acceptable results. Turner died a year later without having satisfactorily projected the footage. In 2012, curators at the [[National Media Museum]] in Bradford, UK, had the original custom-format [[nitrate film]] copied to black-and-white 35&amp;nbsp;mm film, which was then scanned into a digital video format by [[telecine]]. Finally, [[digital image processing]] was used to align and combine each group of three frames into one color image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brianpritchard.com/Lee_Turner_Project.htm Pritchard, B. (2012). "Lee-Turner Project with the National Media Museum".] Retrieved 20 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is that the whole world can now view brief motion pictures from 1902 in full color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World's first colour film unveiled|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/9538882/Worlds-first-colour-film-unveiled.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Visit to the Seaside (1908).webm|thumb|''A Visit to the Seaside'', the first motion picture in Kinemacolor]]
[[File:The Delhi Durbar 1911.webm|thumb|''With Our King and Queen Through India'', extract]]
Practical color in the motion picture business began with [[Kinemacolor]], first demonstrated in 1906.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;  This was a two-color system created in England by [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]], and promoted by film pioneer [[Charles Urban]]'s The Charles Urban Trading Company in 1908.  It was used for a series of films including the documentary ''[[With Our King and Queen Through India]]'', depicting the [[Delhi Durbar]] (also known as ''The Durbar at Delhi'', 1912), which was filmed in December 1911. The Kinemacolor process consisted of alternating frames of specially sensitized black-and-white film exposed at 32 frames per second through a rotating filter with alternating red and green areas. The printed film was projected through similar alternating red and green filters at the same speed. A perceived range of colors resulted from the blending of the separate red and green alternating images by the viewer's persistence of vision.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1917) "Kinemacolor" ''How to Make and Operate Moving Pictures'' Funk &amp; Wagnalls. Courtesy of [http://www.widescreenmuseum.com Wide Screen Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Friese-Greene]] invented another additive color system called Biocolour, which was developed by his son [[Claude Friese-Greene]] after William's death in 1921.  William sued George Albert Smith, alleging that the Kinemacolor process infringed on the patents for his Bioschemes, Ltd.; as a result, Smith's patent was revoked in 1914.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  Both Kinemacolor and Biocolour had problems with "fringing" or "haloing" of the image, due to the separate red and green images not fully matching up.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

By their nature, these additive systems were very wasteful of light. Absorption by the color filters involved meant that only a minor fraction of the projection light actually reached the screen, resulting in an image that was dimmer than a typical black-and-white image. The larger the screen, the dimmer the picture. For this and other case-by-case reasons, the use of additive processes for theatrical motion pictures had been almost completely abandoned by the early 1940s, though additive color methods are employed by all the color [[video]] and computer display systems in common use today.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

===Subtractive color===
The first practical [[subtractive color]] process was introduced by Kodak as "Kodachrome", a name recycled twenty years later for a very different and far better-known product. Filter-photographed red and blue-green records were printed onto the front and back of one strip of black-and-white [[duplitized film]]. After development, the resulting silver images were bleached away and replaced with color dyes, red on one side and cyan on the other. The pairs of superimposed dye images reproduced a useful but limited range of color. Kodak's first narrative film with the process was a short subject entitled ''Concerning $1000'' (1916). Though their duplitized film provided the basis for several commercialized two-color printing processes, the image origination and color-toning methods constituting Kodak's own process were little-used.

The first truly successful subtractive color process was William van Doren Kelley's [[Prizma]],&lt;ref name="afipriz"&gt;Slide, Anthony. (1990) "Prizma Color" ''The American Film Industry: A Historical Dictionary'' Limelight p. 271. {{ISBN|0-87910-139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; an early color process that was first introduced at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City on 8 February 1917.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ra0eAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA150#v=onepage Museum Notes], ''The American Museum Journal'' (1917), vol. 17, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell-Clyne, Adrian. (1951) ''Colour Cinematography'' Chapman and Hall press.&lt;/ref&gt; Prizma began in 1916 as an additive system similar to Kinemacolor.

However, after 1917, Kelley reinvented the process as a subtractive one with several years of short films and travelogues, such as ''Everywhere With Prizma'' (1919) and ''A Prizma Color Visit to Catalina'' (1919) before releasing features such as the documentary ''Bali the Unknown'' (1921), ''[[The Glorious Adventure (1922 film)|The Glorious Adventure]]'' (1922), and ''[[Venus of the South Seas]]'' (1924). A Prizma promotional short filmed for [[Del Monte Foods]] titled ''Sunshine Gatherers'' (1921) is available on DVD in Treasures 5 The West 1898–1938 by the National Film Preservation Foundation.

The invention of Prizma led to a series of similarly printed color processes.  This [[bipack color]] system used two strips of film running through the camera, one recording red, and one recording blue-green light. With the black-and-white negatives being printed onto duplitized film, the color images were then toned red and blue, effectively creating a subtractive color print.

[[Leon Forrest Douglass]] (1869–1940), a founder of [[Victor Records]], developed a system he called Naturalcolor, and first showed a short test film made in the process on 15 May 1917 at his home in [[San Rafael, California]].  The only feature film known to have been made in this process, ''[[Cupid Angling]]'' (1918) — starring [[Ruth Roland]] and with cameo appearances by [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks]] — was filmed in the Lake Lagunitas area of [[Marin County, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Gracyk, Tim. ''[http://www.gracyk.com/leon.shtml Leon F. Douglass: Inventor and Victor's First Vice-President]'' (Retrieved on 2007-03-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

After experimenting with additive systems (including a [[movie camera|camera]] with two [[apertures]], one with a red filter, one with a green filter) from 1915 to 1921, Dr. [[Herbert Kalmus]], Dr. Daniel Comstock, and mechanic W. Burton Wescott developed a [[subtractive color]] system for [[Technicolor]]. The system used a [[beam splitter]] in a specially modified camera to send red and green light to adjacent frames of one strip of black-and-white film. From this negative, skip-printing was used to print each color's frames contiguously onto film stock with half the normal base thickness. The two prints were chemically toned to roughly complementary hues of red and green,&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt; then cemented together, back to back, into a single strip of film. The first film to use this process was ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'' ([[1922 in film|1922]]) starring [[Anna May Wong]]. Perhaps the most ambitious film to use it was ''[[The Black Pirate]]'' ([[1926 in film|1926]]), starring and produced by [[Douglas Fairbanks]].

The process was later refined through the incorporation of dye [[imbibition]], which allowed for the transferring of dyes from both color matrices into a single print, avoiding several problems that had become evident with the cemented prints and allowing multiple prints to be created from a single pair of matrices.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

Technicolor's system was very popular for a number of years, but it was a very expensive process: shooting cost three times that of black-and-white photography and printing costs were no cheaper. By 1932, color photography in general had nearly been abandoned by major studios, until Technicolor developed a new advancement to record all three primary colors. Utilizing a special [[dichroic]] [[beam splitter]] equipped with two 45-degree [[prism (optics)|prism]]s in the form of a cube, light from the lens was deflected by the prisms and split into two paths to expose each one of three black-and-white negatives (one each to record the densities for red, green, and blue).&lt;ref name="afitech"&gt;Slide, Anthony. (1990) "Technicolor" ''The American Film Industry: A Historical Dictionary'' Limelight pp. 338-340. {{ISBN|0-87910-139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three negatives were then printed to gelatin matrices, which also completely bleached the image, washing out the silver and leaving only the gelatin record of the image. A receiver print, consisting of a 50% density print of the black-and-white negative for the green record strip, and including the soundtrack, was struck and treated with dye mordants to aid in the imbibition process (this "black" layer was discontinued in the early 1940s). The matrices for each strip were coated with their complementary dye (yellow, cyan, or magenta), and then each successively brought into high-pressure contact with the receiver, which imbibed and held the dyes, which collectively rendered a wider spectrum of color than previous technologies.&lt;ref name="awsm"&gt;Hart, Martin (2003).

Retrieved 2006-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The first animation film with the three-color (also called three-strip) system was [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'' ([[1932 in film|1932]]), the first short live-action film was ''La Cucaracha'' ([[1934 in film|1934]]), and the first feature was ''[[Becky Sharp (film)|Becky Sharp]]'' ([[1935 in film|1935]]).&lt;ref name="encyclopedia" /&gt;

[[Gasparcolor]], a single-strip 3-color system, was developed in 1933 by the Hungarian chemist Dr. Bela Gaspar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oskarfischinger.org/GasparColor.htm|title=Gasparcolor: Perfect Hues for Animation|publisher=Fischinger Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real push for color films and the nearly immediate changeover from black-and-white production to nearly all color film were pushed forward by the prevalence of television in the early 1950s. In 1947, only 12 percent of American films were made in color. By 1954, that number rose to over 50 percent.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; The rise in color films was also aided by the breakup of Technicolor's near monopoly on the medium.

In 1947, the United States Justice Department filed an antitrust suit against Technicolor for monopolization of color cinematography (even though rival processes such as [[Cinecolor]] and [[Trucolor]] were in general use). In 1950, a federal court ordered Technicolor to allot a number of its three-strip cameras for use by independent studios and filmmakers. Although this certainly affected Technicolor, its real undoing was the invention of [[Eastmancolor]] that same year.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

==Monopack color film==
[[Image:35mm-undevel.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A strip of undeveloped 35 mm color negative.]]

In the field of motion pictures, the many-layered type of color film normally called an ''integral tripack'' in broader contexts has long been known by the less tongue-twisting term ''monopack''. For many years, Monopack (capitalized) was a proprietary product of Technicolor Corp, whereas monopack (not capitalized) generically referred to any of several single-strip color film products, certainly including various Eastman Kodak products. It appears that Technicolor made no attempt to register Monopack as a trademark with the [[US Patent and Trademark Office]], although it certainly asserted that term as if it were a registered trademark, and it had the force of a legal agreement between it and Eastman Kodak to back up that assertion. It was a solely-sourced product, too, as Eastman Kodak was legally prevented from marketing any color motion picture film products wider than 16mm, 35mm specifically, until the expiration of the so-called "Monopack Agreement" in 1950. This, notwithstanding the facts that Technicolor never had the capability to manufacture sensitized motion picture films of any kind, nor single-strip color films based upon its so-called "Troland Patent" (which patent Technicolor maintained covered all monopack-type films in general, but monopack-type motion picture films in particular, and which Eastman Kodak elected not to contest as Technicolor was then one of its largest customers, if not its largest customer). After 1950, Eastman Kodak was free to make and market color films of any kind, particularly including monopack color motion picture films in 65/70mm, 35mm, 16mm and 8mm. The "Monopack Agreement" had no effect on color still films.

Monopack color films are based on the subtractive color system, which filters colors from white light by using superimposed cyan, magenta and yellow dye images. Those images are created from records of the amounts of red, green and blue light present at each point of the image formed by the camera lens. A subtractive primary color (cyan, magenta, yellow) is what remains when one of the additive primary colors (red, green, blue) has been removed from the spectrum. Eastman Kodak's monopack color films incorporated three separate layers of differently color sensitive emulsion into one strip of film. Each layer recorded one of the additive primaries and was processed to produce a dye image in the [[complementary color|complementary]] subtractive primary.

[[Kodachrome]] was the first commercially successful application of monopack multilayer film, introduced in 1935.&lt;ref name="explore"&gt;''Exploring the Color Image'' (1996) Eastman Kodak Publication H-188.&lt;/ref&gt; For professional motion picture photography, Kodachrome Commercial, on a 35mm [[Film perforations#BH|BH-perforated]] base, was available exclusively from Technicolor, as its so-called "Technicolor Monopack" product. Similarly, for sub-professional motion picture photography, Kodachrome Commercial, on a 16mm base, was available exclusively from Eastman Kodak. In both cases, Eastman Kodak was the sole manufacturer and the sole processor. In the 35mm case, Technicolor [[Dye-transfer process|dye-transfer]] printing was a "tie-in" product.&lt;ref&gt;The tie-in ensures the quality of the tied-good when the tied good (dye-transfer printing, in this case) is used in conjunction with the tying good (Three-Strip or Monopack origination, in this case), paraphrasing ''Tie-in Sales and Price Discrimination'', S. J. Liebowitz, University of Texas at Dallas.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16mm case, there were Eastman Kodak duplicating and printing stocks and associated chemistry, not the same as a "tie-in" product. In exceptional cases, Technicolor offered 16mm dye-transfer printing, but this necessitated the exceptionally wasteful process of printing on a 35mm base, only thereafter to be re-perforated and re-slit to 16mm, thereby discarding slightly more than one-half of the end product.

A late modification to the "Monopack Agreement", the "Imbibition Agreement", finally allowed Technicolor to economically manufacture 16mm dye-transfer prints as so-called "double-rank" 35/32mm prints (two 16mm prints on a 35mm base that was originally perforated at the 16mm specification for both halves, and was later re-slit into two 16mm wide prints without the need for re-perforation). This modification also facilitated the early experiments by Eastman Kodak with its negative-positive monopack film, which eventually became Eastmancolor. Essentially, the "Imbibition Agreement" lifted a portion of the "Monopack Agreement's" restrictions on Technicolor (which prevented it from making motion picture products less than 35mm wide) and somewhat related restrictions on Eastman Kodak (which prevented it from experimenting and developing monopack products greater than 16mm wide).

[[Eastmancolor]], introduced in 1950,&lt;ref name="motion.kodak.com"&gt;[http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Chronology_Of_Film/chrono2.htm Chronology of Motion Picture Films: 1940–1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625062139/http://motion.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Products/Chronology_Of_Film/chrono2.htm |date=2009-06-25 }}, Kodak.&lt;/ref&gt; was Kodak's first economical, single-strip [[35 mm film|35 mm]] negative-positive process incorporated into one strip of film.  This rendered Three-Strip color photography relatively obsolete, even though, for the first few years of Eastmancolor, Technicolor continued to offer Three-Strip origination combined with dye-transfer printing (150 titles produced in 1953, 100 titles produced in 1954 and 50 titles produced in 1955, the very last year for Three-Strip).  The first commercial feature film to use Eastmancolor was the documentary ''[[Royal Journey]]'', released in December 1951.&lt;ref name="motion.kodak.com"/&gt;  Hollywood studios waited until an improved version of Eastmancolor negative came out in 1952 before using it; ''[[This is Cinerama]]'' was an early film which employed three separate and interlocked strips of Eastmancolor negative. ''This is Cinerama'' was initially printed on Eastmancolor positive, but its significant success eventually resulted in it being reprinted by Technicolor, using dye-transfer.

By 1953, and especially with the introduction of anamorphic wide screen [[Cinemascope|CinemaScope]], Eastmancolor became a marketing imperative as CinemaScope was incompatible with Technicolor's Three-Strip camera and lenses. Indeed, Technicolor Corp became one of the best, if not the best, processor of Eastmancolor negative, especially for so-called "wide gauge" negatives (5-perf 65mm, 6-perf 35mm), yet it far preferred its own 35mm dye-transfer printing process for Eastmancolor-originated films with a print run that exceeded 500 prints,&lt;ref&gt;At one point, Technicolor implemented a two-tiered print pricing structure, one for dye-transfer prints, which favored large volume printing, and one Eastmancolor prints, which favored small volume printing—but this was after the "tie-in" between origination and printing had been broken by the abandonment of Three-Strip and Monopack origination. For small print runs, dye-transfer remained an option, but at a significantly higher cost.&lt;/ref&gt; not withstanding the significant "loss of register" that occurred in such prints that were expanded by CinemaScope's 2X horizontal factor, and, to a lesser extent, with so-called "flat wide screen" (variously 1.66:1 or 1.85:1, but spherical and not anamorphic). This nearly fatal flaw was not corrected until 1955 and caused numerous features initially printed by Technicolor to be scrapped and reprinted by [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|DeLuxe Labs]]. (These features are often billed as "Color by Technicolor-DeLuxe".) Indeed, some Eastmancolor-originated films billed as "Color by Technicolor" were never actually printed using the dye-transfer process, due in part to the throughput limitations of Technicolor's dye-transfer printing process, and competitor DeLuxe's superior throughput. Incredibly, DeLuxe once had a license to install a Technicolor-type dye-transfer printing line, but as the "loss of register" problems became apparent in Fox's CinemaScope features that were printed by Technicolor, after Fox had become an all-CinemaScope producer, Fox-owned DeLuxe Labs abandoned its plans for dye-transfer printing and became, and remained, an all-Eastmancolor shop, as Technicolor itself later became.

Technicolor continued to offer its proprietary imbibition dye-transfer printing process for projection prints until 1975, and even briefly revived it in 1998.  As an archival format, Technicolor prints are one of the most stable color print processes yet created, and prints properly cared for are estimated to retain their color for centuries.&lt;ref name="wilhelm"&gt;Wilhelm, Henry with Brower, Carol (1993) ''The Permanence and Care of Color Photographs''.

Improperly stored monopack color film from before 1983 can incur a 30 percent image loss in as little as 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;Holben, Jay (June 1999).

==How a color film works==
[[Image:Color film.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A representation of the layers within a piece of developed color 35 mm negative film. When developed, the dye couplers in the blue-, green-, and red-sensitive layers turn the exposed silver halide crystals to their complementary colors (yellow, magenta, and cyan). The film is made up of (A) Clear protective topcoat, (B) UV filter, (C) "Fast" blue layer, (D) "Slow" blue layer, (E) Yellow filter to cut all blue light from passing through to (F) "Fast" green layer, (G) "Slow" green layer, (H) Inter (subbing) layer, (I) "Fast" red layer, (J) "Slow" red layer, (K) Clear triacetate base, and (L) Antihalation (rem-jet) backing.]]

A color film is made up of many different layers that work together to create the color image.  Color negative films provide three main color layers: the blue record, green record, and red record; each made up of two separate layers containing silver halide crystals and dye-couplers.  A cross-sectional representation of a piece of developed color negative film is shown in the figure at the right.  Each layer of the film is so thin that the composite of all layers, in addition to the triacetate base and antihalation backing, is less than 0.0003" (8&amp;nbsp;µm) thick.&lt;ref name="hone"&gt;''Kodak Motion Picture Film (H1)'' (4th ed). Eastman Kodak Company. {{ISBN|0-87985-477-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three color records are stacked as shown at right, with a UV filter on top to keep the non-visible ultraviolet radiation from exposing the silver-halide crystals, which are naturally sensitive to UV light.  Next are the fast and slow blue-sensitive layers, which, when developed, form the latent image.  When the exposed silver-halide crystal is developed, it is coupled with a dye grain of its complementary color.  This forms a dye "cloud" (like a drop of water on a paper towel) and is limited in its growth by development-inhibitor-releasing (DIR) couplers, which also serve to refine the sharpness of the processed image by limiting the size of the dye clouds. The dye clouds formed in the blue layer are actually yellow (the opposite or complementary color to blue).&lt;ref name="stockone"&gt;Holben, Jay. (April 2000). "Taking Stock" Part 1 of 2. ''American Cinematographer Magazine'' ASC Press. pp. 118-130&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two layers to each color; a "fast" and a "slow."  The fast layer features larger grains that are more sensitive to light than the slow layer, which has finer grain and is less sensitive to light.  Silver-halide crystals are naturally sensitive to blue light, so the blue layers are on the top of the film and they are followed immediately by a yellow filter, which stops any more blue light from passing through to the green and red layers and biasing those crystals with extra blue exposure.  Next are the red-sensitive record (which forms cyan dyes when developed); and, at the bottom, the green-sensitive record, which forms magenta dyes when developed.  Each color is separated by a gelatin layer that prevents silver development in one record from causing unwanted dye formation in another. On the back of the [[film base]] is an anti-halation layer that absorbs light which would otherwise be weakly reflected back through the film by that surface and create halos of light around bright features in the image. In color film, this backing is "rem-jet", a black-pigmented, non-gelatin layer which is removed in the developing process.&lt;ref name="hone" /&gt;

Eastman Kodak manufactures film in 54-inch (1,372&amp;nbsp;mm) wide rolls.  These rolls are then slit into various sizes (70&amp;nbsp;mm, 65&amp;nbsp;mm, 35&amp;nbsp;mm, 16&amp;nbsp;mm) as needed.

==Manufacturers of color film for motion picture use==
{{see also|List of motion picture film stocks}}

Motion picture film, primarily because of the rem-jet backing, requires different processing than standard [[C-41 process]] color film. The process necessary is ECN-2, which has an initial step using an alkaline bath to remove the backing layer. There are also minor differences in the remainder of the process. If motion picture negative is run through a standard C-41 color film developer bath, the rem-jet backing partially dissolves and destroys the integrity of the developer and, potentially, ruins the film.

===Kodak color motion picture films===
In the late 1980s, Kodak introduced the [[Tabular-grain film|T-Grain]] emulsion, a technological advancement in the shape and make-up of silver halide grains in their films. T-Grain is a tabular silver halide grain that allows for greater overall surface area, resulting in greater light sensitivity with a relatively small grain and a more uniform shape that results in a less overall graininess to the film. This made for sharper and more sensitive films. The T-Grain technology was first employed in Kodak's EXR line of motion picture color negative stocks.&lt;ref name="stocktwo"&gt;Probst, Christopher. (May 2000). "Taking Stock" Part 2 of 2 ''American Cinematographer Magazine'' ASC Press. pp. 110-120&lt;/ref&gt; This was further refined in 1996 with the Vision line of emulsions, followed by Vision2 in the early 2000s and Vision3 in 2007.

===Fuji color motion picture films===
Fuji films also integrate tabular grains in their SUFG (Super Unified Fine Grain) films. In their case, the SUFG grain is not only tabular, it is hexagonal and consistent in shape throughout the emulsion layers. Like the T-grain, it has a larger surface area in a smaller grain (about one-third the size of traditional grain) for the same light sensitivity. In 2005, Fuji unveiled their Eterna 500T stock, the first in a new line of advanced emulsions, with Super Nano-structure Σ Grain Technology.

[[File:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|right|360px|Expansion of U.S. copyright term (Assuming authors create their works at age 35 and live for 70 years)]]
'''Copyright term''' is the length of time [[copyright]] subsists in a work before it passes into the [[public domain]].

==Length of copyright==
Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. [[musical composition]] or [[novel]]), whether the work has been published or not, and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. In most countries (for example, the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|305}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations |date=1995|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19953297_en_3.htm |title=Amendments of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;) copyright expires at the end of the calendar year in question.

The length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the copyright duration in a given country difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately six years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes [[Ex post facto law|retroactively]]). International treaties, like the [[Berne Convention]], establish minimum terms for copyrights, but these only apply to the signatory countries, and individual countries may grant longer terms than those set out in a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Copyright: Sacred Text, Technology, and the DMCA |last=Nimmer |first=David |publisher=Kluwer Law International |year=2003 |isbn=978-90-411-8876-2 |oclc=50606064 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RYfRCNxgPO4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
===Copyright term and the public domain===
The extension of copyright term, imposes tangible restrictions on the [[public domain]]. For instance, scholar Neil Netanel argued that [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] 1998 prevented the entering of works central to [[Culture of the United States|cultural heritage of the US]] into the public domain. He argued, culturally important dissemination, recasting, or incorporation into new expression is prevented due "to the copyright holder's veto". As examples he gave the adaption of the plot from novels such as [[The Great Gatsby]] and [[Peter Pan]], the refashion of characters like [[Mickey Mouse]], or the use of [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs like "[[Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love)]]" for documentaries about the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=nethanel&gt;{{Cite book| last = Netanel| first = Neil| title = Copyright’s paradox| publisher = Oxford University Press US| date = 2008| pages = 200| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=vo9G-0iZNQIC&amp;dq=orphan+works&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780195137620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright term and orphan works===
For the millions of older copyrighted works of less enduring popularity, it is difficult, or impossible, to trace the copyright ownership and determine who holds the particular rights that would have to be licensed for the use of the work. The problem of such [[orphan works]] stems from the extension of copyright term and the lack of requirement for the copyright owner to renew or [[Copyright registration|register their copyright]].&lt;ref name=nethanel/&gt; In order to tackle this perceived problem some jurisdictions have [[Copyright reform|revised their copyright laws]] to allow use of orphaned works, after diligent searches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/chapter/III/crossheading/orphan-works] Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988, s44B&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and discussion==
Discussions about the optimal length of the copyright term (e.g. regarding the copyrights incentive for creative production&lt;ref name="petra moser"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130214025845/http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/mdocs/en/wipo_ip_econ_ge_5_12/wipo_ip_econ_ge_5_12_ref_moser.pdf DEAD POETS’ PROPERTY - THE COPYRIGHT ACT OF 1814 AND THE PRICE OF LITERATURE IN THE ROMANTIC PERIOD] XING LI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY, MEGAN MACGARVIE, BOSTON UNIVERSITY AND NBER, AND PETRA MOSER, STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND NBER (NOVEMBER 14, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;) is a significant part of public and scientific discourse and reception.&lt;ref name="JASSS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/15868004 Copyright and wrong - Why the rules on copyright need to return to their roots] on [[The Economist]] ''"The notion that lengthening copyright increases creativity is questionable, however.

If anything, patents inhibit innovation. |publisher=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earlier and often cited positions is from the British politician [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] who argued in an 1841 speech in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that copyright is a [[monopoly]] and as such has generally negative effects on society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.law.asu.edu/~dkarjala/OpposingCopyrightExtension/commentary/MacaulaySpeeches.html MacaulaySpeeches] on law.asu.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepublicdomain.org/2014/07/24/macaulay-on-copyright/ macaulay-on-copyright] on thepublicdomain.org&lt;/ref&gt; Although Macaulay's speech is widely reported, the reaction to it in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] is hard to find – Ricketson reports that following Macaulay's claims that the heirs of certain authors would block publication of their works:

:"At this point, the debate in the House of Commons fell into farce because there were claims by other speakers that they had no doubts (based on their own personal knowledge) that Richardson and Boswell's descendants would still have done the right thing and allowed reprinting, however much they abhorred their ancestors' works!"&lt;ref&gt;Sam Ricketson, The copyright term, International Review of Intellectual Property and Competition Law (1992), 753, p767.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also worth noting that Macaulay is arguing here against term extension, he is not arguing against copyright. This point is well made by Macaulay himself:

:"The advantages arising from a system of copyright are obvious. It is desirable that we should have a supply of good books: we cannot have such a supply unless men of letters are liberally remunerated; and the least objectionable way of remunerating them is by means of copyright."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Babington Macaulay, Speeches of Lord Macaulay, Longman, Green, Longman and Roberts, 1860, p232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liebowitz describes use of the term monopoly in relation to copyright as misleading, but "rhetorically effective".&lt;ref&gt;Stan Liebowitz, A critique of copyright criticism, George Mason Law Review, vol 22:4:943 (2015), p958.&lt;/ref&gt; While Towse writes that a more appropriate term is '[[monopolistic competition]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Towse, Copyright, risk and the artist: an economic approach to policy for artists, International Journal of Cultural Policy, 6:1:91 (1999), p105, note 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a paper by [[Rufus Pollock]] of [[University of Cambridge]] scientifically quantified the optimal copyright term length at 15 years, significantly shorter than any currently existing copyright term, via an economical model with [[U-statistic|empirically-estimable parameter]]s.&lt;ref name="HoEoC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archivedate=2013-02-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221124708/http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_over_time.pdf |url=http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf |title=OPTIMAL COPYRIGHT OVER TIME: TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND THE STOCK OF WORKS |first=Rufus |last=Pollock |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |date=2007-10-01 |accessdate=2015-01-11 |authorlink=Rufus Pollock |quote=''The optimal level for copyright has been a matter for extensive debate over the last decade. Using a parsimonious theoretical model this paper contributes several new results of relevance to this debate. In particular we demonstrate that (a) optimal copyright is likely to fall as the production costs of `originals' decline (for example as a result of digitization) (b) technological change which reduces costs of production may imply a decrease or a decrease in optimal levels of protection (this contrasts with a large number of commentators, particularly in the copyright industries, who have argued that such change necessitates increases in protection) (c) the optimal level of copyright will, in general, fall over time as the stock of work increases.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archivedate=2013-01-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112152530/http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf |url=http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf |title=FOREVER MINUS A DAY?

Based on a novel approach we derive an explicit formula which characterises the optimal term as a function of a few key and, most importantly, empirically-estimable parameters. Using existing data on recordings and books we obtain a point estimate of around 15 years for optimal copyright term with a 99% confidence interval extending up to 38 years. This is substantially shorter than any current copyright term and implies that existing terms are too long.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 scholar Petra Moser concluded in a paper on the impact of the copyright extension on the British [[Copyright Act 1814|Copyright Act of 1814]] that "longer copyrights raise the costs of accessing intellectual assets for consumers and other firms, which may discourage the diffusion of knowledge and decelerate the pace of cumulative innovation and [[Learning-by-doing (economics)|learning-by-doing]]."&lt;ref name="petra moser"/&gt;

In 2014 a [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] article about the existence of [[Orphaned works|orphaned]] classical [[video game]]s and the suggestion of letting them enter the public domain after 20 years, raised a controversial public debate about copyright terms and public domain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/29/gogs-time-machine-sale-lets-you-control-time-itself/ |title=GOG’s Time Machine Sale Lets You CONTROL TIME ITSELF |first=John |last=Walker |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2016-01-30 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |quote=''As someone who desperately pines for the PD model that drove creativity before the copyright industry malevolently took over the planet, it saddens my heart that a game two decades old isn’t released into the world.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/02/03/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain/ |title=Editorial: Why Games Should Enter The Public Domain |first=John |last=Walker |date=2014-02-03 |accessdate=2016-01-30 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |quote=''games more than a couple of decades old aren’t entering the public domain.

A March 2015 published [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]] paper, analysed with a simulated model the relationship of scientific knowledge creation to copyright term length and concluded a decreased knowledge production on copyright term increases for the analysed context.&lt;ref name="JASSS"&gt;[http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/18/2/23.html Does Longer Copyright Protection Help or Hurt Scientific Knowledge Creation?] [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]] 18 (2) 23 DOI: 10.18564/jasss.2720 ''"The prevailing trend in most simulations was that increasing the copyright term resulted decreased knowledge production."''

As a curiosity, the work ''[[Peter and Wendy#Copyright status|Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'' is subject in the UK to a special clause in the [[Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988]]&lt;ref&gt;Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 s301 and schedule 6.&lt;/ref&gt; that granted [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] a right to royalty in perpetuity. [[J M Barrie]] had gifted the copyright to the work to the hospital in 1929. The different copyright terms in the various jurisdictions has led to some disputes involving derivative works created and/or sold elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/cases/emily_somma_v_gosh_peter_.shtml  |title=Stanford Center for Internet and Society |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2010-05-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061027134508/http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/cases/emily_somma_v_gosh_peter_.shtml |archivedate = 2006-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downtown Las Vegas''' (commonly abbreviated as '''DTLV''') is the [[central business district]] and historic center of [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. It is the original townsite and was the gambling district of Las Vegas prior to [[the Strip]], and the area still incorporates [[Downtown gaming Las Vegas|downtown gaming]]. As the urban core of the [[Las Vegas Valley]], it features a variety of hotel and business [[highrise]]s, cultural centers, historical buildings and government institutions, as well as residential and retail developments.  Downtown is located in the center of the Las Vegas Valley and just north of the [[Las Vegas Strip]], centered on [[Fremont Street]], the [[Fremont Street Experience]] and [[Fremont East]].  The city defines the area as bounded by [[Interstate 15|I-15]] on the west, Washington Avenue on the north, Maryland Parkway on the east and Sahara Avenue on the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schoenmann |first=Joe |date=March 19, 2014 |title=Joe Downtown: The boundaries of downtown Las Vegas are as fluid as its reputation |url=http://lasvegasweekly.com/column/joe-downtown/2014/mar/19/boundaries-downtown-las-vegas-are-fluid-reputation/?_ga=1.239706432.27414779.1396127750 |newspaper=[[Las Vegas Weekly]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate=March 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Vic-yellowshirt.JPG|thumb|Downtown Las Vegas casinos on Fremont Street (1973)]]
Perhaps the earliest visitors to the Las Vegas area were nomadic [[Paleo-Indians]], who traveled here 10,000 years ago, leaving behind [[petroglyph]]s. [[Anasazi]] and [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]] tribes came here at least 2,000 years ago.

The area was named Las Vegas, which is Spanish for ''the meadows'', in the 1800s because it featured abundant wild grasses, as well as desert spring waters for westward travelers.

The year 1844 marked the arrival of [[John C. Frémont]], whose writings helped lure pioneers to the area. Downtown Las Vegas’ Fremont Street is named after him.

Eleven years later, members of the [[LDS Church]] chose Las Vegas as the site to build a fort halfway between [[Salt Lake City]] and [[Los Angeles]], where they would travel to gather supplies. The fort was abandoned several years afterward. The remainder of this fort can still be seen at the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and Washington Avenue at the [[Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park]].

Las Vegas was founded as a city in 1905, when 110 acres of land adjacent to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] tracks were auctioned in what would become the downtown area. In 1911, Las Vegas was incorporated as a city.

The year 1931 was a pivotal one for Las Vegas. At that time, Nevada legalized casino gambling and reduced residency requirements for divorce to six weeks.  This year also witnessed the beginning of construction on nearby [[Hoover Dam]]. The influx of construction workers and their families helped Las Vegas avoid economic calamity during the [[Great Depression]]. It was completed in 1935.

Following [[World War II]], lavishly decorated hotels, gambling casinos and big-name entertainment became synonymous with Las Vegas.

The 1950s saw the opening of the [[Moulin Rouge Hotel]], the first racially integrated casino-hotel in Las Vegas.

In 1951, the first [[atomic bomb]] detonation at the [[Nevada Test Site]], 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas, occurred.  City residents and visitors were able to witness the [[mushroom cloud]]s until 1963, when the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]] required that nuclear tests be moved underground.

During the 1960s, corporations and business powerhouses such as [[Howard Hughes]] were building and buying hotel-casino properties. Gambling was referred to as "gaming," which transitioned into legitimate business.

In 1989, entrepreneur [[Steve Wynn]] changed the face of the Las Vegas gaming industry by opening up [[The Mirage]], the Las Vegas Strip’s first mega-casino resort. This strengthened the pull of visitors away from the downtown area.

In 1995, the [[Fremont Street Experience]] in Las Vegas’ downtown area was opened. This canopied, five-block area features 12.5 million LED lights and 550,000 watts of sound from dusk until midnight during shows held on the top of each hour.

Due to years of revitalization efforts, 2012 was dubbed “The Year of Downtown.” Hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of projects made their debut at this time. They included The Smith Center for the Performing Arts and Discovery Children’s Museum, the Mob Museum, the Neon Museum, a new City Hall complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/factsstatistics/history.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050727081949/http://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/FactsStatistics/history.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-07-27|title=History (Official City of Las Vegas Web Site)|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/travel/cityguide/article/0,31489,1838100_1838099_1838098,00.html|title=Las Vegas: 10 Things to Do — 10. Downtown - TIME|work=Time|access-date=2017-02-28|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, plans for a new downtown expo center were announced, replacing and expanding on space previously provided by the Cashman Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/las-vegas/downtown-las-vegas-to-get-new-76m-expo-center/|title=Downtown Las Vegas to get new $76M expo center|date=29 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neighborhoods and attractions==

===Fremont Street Casino District===

Property and business owners have been working to redevelop Fremont Street just east of the Fremont Street Experience. In 2002, the city of [[Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency]] joined with Fremont East property and business owners to create a [[business improvement district]], as well as pay for a $5.5 million streetscape improvement. This area is called the Fremont East Entertainment District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fremont East Entertainment District|url=http://lasvegasnevada.gov/Government/7589.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features an eclectic mix of bars, clubs and restaurants.

===The Arts District===
{{Main|Downtown Arts District}}
Officially called 18b, The Las Vegas Arts District – named after the 18 blocks the district originally encompassed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=18b, The Las Vegas Arts District website|url=http://www.18b.org/las-vegas-arts-district}}&lt;/ref&gt; – this area is home to the city's arts scene with its mix of art galleries, studios and stores. Many arts district stores offer antiques, vintage clothing, high fashion, and mid-20th century furniture/furnishings and other collectible items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.18b.org/places/type/antiques|title=The Las Vegas Arts District|website=www.18b.org|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centered on Main Street and Charleston Boulevard, the area hosts the popular First Friday festival every month featuring art, music and other performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasnevada.gov/Government/7550.htm|title=lasvegasnevada.gov|website=www.lasvegasnevada.gov|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstfridaylasvegas.com/|title=First Friday Monthly Art Festival - First Friday Foundation|website=First Friday Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symphony Park===
{{Main|Symphony Park}}
[[Symphony Park]] is a mixed-use urban district being built on the land to the west of Fremont and Main streets. It will eventually feature a mix of retail, medical, hotel and residential developments. The city of Las Vegas is undertaking the development on {{convert|61|acre}} of land purchased from the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] in 1995. This is a major project for the [[Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency]] and the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Union Park Overview|url=http://www.unionparkvegas.com/unionparkoverview.aspx |accessdate=December 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208202131/http://www.unionparkvegas.com/unionparkoverview.aspx |archivedate=December 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects that have been completed and are currently operating at Symphony Park are the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cleveland Clinic website|url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/neurological_institute/lou-ruvo-brain-health/default.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smith Center for the Performing Arts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Smith Center website|url=http://www.thesmithcenter.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Discovery Children's Museum.&lt;ref name="DISCOVERY"&gt;{{cite web|title=DISCOVERY Children's Museum|url=http://www.discoverykidslv.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Las Vegas website|url=http://lasvegasnevada.gov/Government/7598.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Las Vegas Medical District===
Business and government leaders have begun working on a plan to expand downtown’s Las Vegas Medical District (LVMD) from its current 200 acres to at least 680 acres. While currently offering the largest concentration of health-care services in the Las Vegas valley, an expanded district would allow for additional health-care services and opportunities. Areas for planned expansion include the Charleston Boulevard corridor to Valley View Boulevard, along Martin L. King Boulevard and in Symphony Park. The centerpiece of this expanded district will be the 260,000-square-foot UNLV School of Medicine, which will include an educational building and library. The school was granted preliminary accreditation in late 2016 and can begin accepting students for its 2017 charter class.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

===Financial District===
Centered on Bonneville Avenue and Casino Center Boulevard, most of this area is filled with office and government buildings.  With several court buildings located here, there are many judicial-related businesses such as law firms in the immediate area.  The financial district is home to the [[Las Vegas City Hall]] building, the Lloyd D. George U.S. Courthouse and several bank buildings such as [[Bank of America]]. The Clark County Marriage Bureau is also located here at the Regional Justice Center.&lt;ref name="lasvegasnevada.gov"/&gt;

===Art and culture===
[[File:LasVegasSymphonyPark1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Symphony Park]]]]
Downtown is a hub for arts and culture in the metro area.  The main venue for performing arts is the [[Art Deco]]-inspired [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts]]. In addition to The Smith Center and 18b, The Las Vegas Arts District, there are a number of educational facilities in the Cultural Corridor, located just north of the immediate downtown area. They include the Las Vegas Natural History Museum, the Neon Museum and Boneyard and the Old Las Vegas Mormon Fort State Historic Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultural Corridor website|url=http://culturalcorridorvegas.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in this area are a number of neon signs from former Las Vegas casinos and landmarks, which have been restored and installed on several streets around downtown, as well as throughout the Fremont Street Experience. A famous neon icon of downtown Las Vegas is the [[Vegas Vic]] sign, also located at the Fremont Street Experience.

===Architecture===
Several buildings of architectural significance exist downtown, although being founded in 1905, Las Vegas lacks the number of historical buildings of older cities. Exceptions include the Historic Fifth Street School, built in 1936 in the Spanish-mission style and listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Also listed is the [[Las Vegas Post Office and Courthouse]], which currently serves as home to The Mob Museum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mob Museum website|url=http://www.themobmuseum.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the few historical neoclassical buildings in the city.  Built in 1930, the Las Vegas Academy of International Studies and Performing Arts is the city's best example of Art Deco architecture.  The Morelli House, built in 1959, is a notable mid-century modern design.  The building that formerly housed the Las Vegas City Hall, and now is home to the corporate headquarters for the online retailer Zappos.com, is a notable example of 1970s modern architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aialasvegas.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=34|title=About the Historic 5th Street School - American Institute of Architects Las Vegas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aialasvegas.org/associations/9424/files/Visitors%20Guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As Las Vegas boomed, more recent buildings tended to take inspiration from a variety of styles.  The Clark County Government Center has a red sandstone exterior invoking a desert motif.  The [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts]], opened in 2012, is a more modern example of Art Deco design. Architect [[Frank Gehry]] designed the building for the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health building in deconstructionist style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.unlv.edu/arch/lasvegas/downtown01b.html|title=Architecture Studies Library - University Libraries|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was completed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lasvegasnevada.gov/Government/7598.htm|title=Symphony Park (Official City of Las Vegas Web Site)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
Downtown serves as a main center for government services in the [[Las Vegas Valley]].  Government offices for the city of Las Vegas and Clark County are located here, as well as the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department]] and several courts.

Some former government buildings have been turned into attractions, such as the old [[Las Vegas Post Office and Courthouse]] becoming the [[Mob Museum]].

==Transportation==

Two major freeways—Interstate 15 and Interstate 515/U.S. Route 95—cross in downtown Las Vegas. [[RTC Transit]] is a public transportation system providing bus service throughout Las Vegas, including the downtown area.

A [[bus rapid transit]] link in Las Vegas called the Strip &amp; Downtown Express (previously ACE Gold Line) with limited stops and frequent service was launched in March 2010. It connects downtown Las Vegas, the Strip and the Las Vegas Convention Center. It stops at the Bonneville Transit Center.  Completed in 2012, the transit terminal serves as a central transfer point for downtown and features 16 vehicle bays for buses and 100 bike racks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtcsouthernnevada.com/transit/btc/tour.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526141505/http://www.rtcsouthernnevada.com/transit/btc/tour.cfm |archivedate=2011-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Downtown Loop is a free shuttle servicing many attractions in downtown Las Vegas.  The Loop runs continuously during operating hours and arrives at each stop every 20 minutes. The hours of operation are Monday through Thursday: 11:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.; Friday through Saturday: 3 p.m. to 12 a.m.; Sunday: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.

The AAA Free Self-Driving Shuttle is a pilot program that provides rides in the Fremont East Entertainment District Nov 2017 – Nov 2018. The pilot program is a partnership with [http://www.keolisnorthamerica.com/ Keolis], the [[city of Las Vegas]], and the [[Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada]]. The shuttle runs Tuesday – Sunday 4:30pm – 8:30pm, with the main station stop at the Downtown Container Park. Shuttle service is suspended during the month of August.

==Economy==
The economy of downtown Las Vegas has been primarily based on gambling and entertainment, as is the case in the greater [[Las Vegas Valley]]. However, the smaller downtown casinos earn revenues that pale in comparison to the mega resorts on the Las Vegas Strip further south. As of 2014, there have been major renovations of several downtown resorts such as [[Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino|The Plaza]], Golden Gate Hotel, [[Golden Nugget Las Vegas|Golden Nugget]], El Cortez Hotel &amp; Casino, the D and the Downtown Grand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/mar/20/downtown-casino-renovations-maintain-old-vegas-vib/|title=Downtown casino renovations maintain Old Vegas vibe|author=Ron Sylvester|work=LasVegasSun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/apr/10/strip-gaming-revenue-rose-33-percent-february/|title=Strip gaming revenue rose 3.3 percent in February|author=Cy Ryan|work=LasVegasSun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown Las Vegas also houses some corporate offices, as well as the World Market Center Las Vegas, a frequent host of trade shows and conventions.  Recently, the opening of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health and the arrival of the new Zappos headquarters downtown has started to attract new medical and technology-oriented businesses to the area.

===Revitalization===
The downtown area in recent decades has played second fiddle to the larger and more famous [[Las Vegas Strip]], which is located a few miles to the south. The city has been working on revitalization efforts to entice more visitors and residents to the downtown area.
[[Image:WMCLV GrandPlaza.jpg|thumb|right|The World Market Center Las Vegas complex]]
[[File:The Smith Center for the Performing Arts &amp; DISCOVERY Children's Museum.jpg|thumb|right|The Smith Center for the Performing Arts]]
World Market Center Las Vegas consists of three giant buildings, with a total of 5.1 million square feet, in a facility designed by [[Jon Jerde]]. It is home to semiannual trade shows for the furniture and furnishing industries. This is one of several entities that are helping to diversity downtown Las Vegas' economy and job base.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Market Center Las Vegas]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The square footage of World Market Center Las Vegas is greater than both the [[Willis Tower]] in [[Chicago]] and the [[Empire State Building]] in [[New York City]].

The city is also working to attract events to the downtown area. Recently held events include ''Helldorado''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elkshelldorado.com|title=Elks Helldorado Days Official Website - Join us May 14-17, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Life is Beautiful'' festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeisbeautifulfestival.com/|title=Life is Beautiful Life is Beautiful|work=Life is Beautiful}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 several new downtown projects were completed. The [[Smith Center for the Performing Arts]], the new [[Mob Museum]] and a new City Hall building opened. The Discovery Children's Museum opened next door to The Smith Center in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2013/mar/07/new-discovery-childrens-museum-opens-weekend/|title=New Discovery: Children's museum opens this weekend|author=Ken Miller|date=7 March 2013|work=LasVegasWeekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Las Vegas City Hall now operates out of a new building, which, along with the Bonneville Transit center, can serve as an anchor tenant for new development along Main Street.&lt;ref&gt;2013 Fiscal Year In Review, city of Las Vegas Economic and Urban Development Projects, "A New Downtown Emerges."&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Main and Commerce streets in downtown Las Vegas are undergoing major beautification efforts, which started in mid-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2014/apr/17/joe-downtown-construction-begin-downtown-beautific/|title=Joe Downtown: Construction to begin on downtown beautification project|author=Joe Schoenmann|work=LasVegasSun.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online retailer [[Zappos]] made major renovations to the old Las Vegas City Hall, and moved into the building in late 2013, which now houses its corporate headquarters. Zappos CEO [[Tony Hsieh]] has taken a personal, as well as a professional, interest in the urban area and is contributing $350 million of his personal wealth toward a multifaceted revitalization effort called the Downtown Project, with businesses like [[The Writer's Block]] included among its investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/magazine/what-happens-in-brooklyn-moves-to-vegas.html|title=What Happens in Brooklyn Moves to Vegas|date=21 October 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Finn and Hengest''''' is a study by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], edited by Alan Bliss and published posthumously in book form in 1982.

[[Finn (Frisian)|Finn]] and [[Hengest]] are two [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] heroes appearing in the [[Old English language|Old English]] epic poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' and in the fragment of "[[The Fight at Finnsburg]]". Hengest has sometimes been identified with the [[Hengest|Jutish king of Kent]]. He and his brother [[Horsa]] (the names meaning "[[stallion]]" and "horse") were the legendary leaders of the first Anglo-Saxon immigrants to [[Great Britain|Britain]] as mercenaries in the 5th century.

The book is based on an edited series of lectures Tolkien made before and after [[World War II]]. In his lectures, Tolkien argued that the Hengest of "[[The Fight at Finnsburg]]" and ''[[Beowulf]]'' was a historical rather than a legendary figure and that these works record episodes from an orally composed and transmitted history of the [[Hengest]] named in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J. R. R. |last=Tolkien |editor=[[Michael D. C. Drout]] |title=[[Beowulf and the Critics]] |year=2002 |publisher=Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, [[Arizona State University]] |isbn=0-86698-290-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has gained acceptance from a number of medieval historians and Anglo-Saxon scholars both since Tolkien's initial lectures and since the publication of this posthumous collection.

Tolkien's lectures describe what he called the "Jutes-on-both-sides theory", which was his explanation for the puzzling occurrence of the word ''ēotenas'' in the episode in ''Beowulf''. Tolkien read the word as [[Jutes]], and theorised that the fight was a purely Jutish feud, and Finn and Hnæf were simply caught up by circumstance. Tolkien explained both their presence and their ambiguous loyalty with his interpretation of the story.

==Synopsis and interpretation by Tolkien==

[[Hnæf]], son of Hoc Half-Dane, is the lord of a Danish people who have conquered part of [[Jutland]] (probably the northern part of the [[Cimbrian Peninsula]]) and exiled its former Jutish rulers. Finn, king of Frys-Land (modern-day [[Friesland]] in the Netherlands) has allowed dispossessed Jutes to settle in his lands and enter his service. Finn marries Hnæf's older sister [[Hildeburh]], and sends their son (whose name was probably Friðuwulf) to be [[Foster care|foster]]ed in Hnæf's household.

Around the year AD 450, Hnæf sails to Frys-Land in the autumn; his purpose is to return Finn's now-grown son and spend the winter in Finn's citadel, celebrating [[Yule]]. He brings a retinue of some sixty [[Thegn|thanes.]] Chief among these thanes is a Jute named Hengest, leader of a band of Jutes who have taken service under Hnæf. Unfortunately, and foreseen by no one, when they arrive at Finn's stronghold they find that many of Finn's thanes are also Jutes, particularly one Garulf, who seems to be the rightful heir to the kingdom conquered by Hnæf's people; and these Frisian Jutes are at [[blood feud]] with Hengest and his band, because Hengest supports the conquering Danes, if for no other reason. This would explain why Hildeburh "had no cause to praise the fealty of the Jutes," since that fealty led to the re-awakening of the feud, which killed her brother, husband, and son.

Finn (who seems guiltless in Tolkien's interpretation) tries to prevent trouble by separating the parties, and allowing Hnæf and his thanes to occupy the royal hall, while he removes his own thanes to a different building. However, the Frisian Jutes make a pre-dawn attack, hoping to take Hengest and his band by surprise. But the Danes have been expecting trouble, and a watchman sees the light of their approaching torches. He asks rhetorically, "What is this light?  Is it the dawn in the East, or is it the flight of a dragon, or are the gables burning?"  Hnæf answers, "Neither is this the dawn in the East, nor is it the flight of a dragon, nor are the gables of this hall burning," it is an attack.
Prepared, the Danes and Hengest's Jutes barricade the two doors of the hall against attack. Garulf is warned by one [[Guðhere]] not to risk his "precious life" in the assault, but he attacks and is the first to fall. Finn's Frisian thanes, who have ties of marriage and friendship to Finn's Jutish thanes, join in the fight against the Danes. The Danes hold the hall for five days without losing a man. On the morning of the fifth day the Frisians force their way into the hall, and in the battle, both Hnæf and Friðiwulf are killed. (It is not clear which side Friðiwulf was fighting on, but Tolkien thinks it likely he was staying in the hall with Hnæf, his foster-father and uncle; this would explain why ''Beowulf'' emphasises that Friðiwulf was laid on the funeral pyre at Hnæf's side.) The surviving Danes, and Hengest's Jutes, drive the Frisians and Jutes out of the hall and re-barricade the door.

At this point Finn (who may not have joined in the fight personally) intervenes and offers to make a bargain with the survivors. As Tolkien points out, the Danes had several advantages:
#Finn had lost so many men that he could not force his way into the hall again.
#The Danes were occupying his royal hall, and he was unwilling to burn it to get them out.
#Finn must have felt both guilty and ashamed that his feuding thanes had killed Hnæf, who was his brother-in-law and guest.

Inside the hall, the survivors are in two groups: Danes, led by a chief thane who is described as ''Hunlafing'' ("the son of Hunlaf") and Jutes, led by Hengest.  The Jutes are Hengest's own band, and owed loyalty to Hnæf only because Hengest followed him.  Finn at first tries to make peace with the Danes only, but the Danes loyally insist that any peace agreement must include Hengest and his men.  Finn agrees, and swears an oath of peace: the Danes and Hengest's men will lay down their arms, and since they cannot leave Frys-Land until the winter ends, they will sit at Finn's table and technically accept him as their protector (since he was now their only possible source of food and maintenance, and they had intended to be his guests throughout the winter anyway.)  Finn gives the Danes a separate hall to dwell in for the winter, specifying that they shall share it with the sons of the Jutes (meaning Hengest and his band.)  He also swears that any one of his own thanes who tries to renew the feud (by taunting the Danes that they now follow the slayer of their lord) will be punished, possibly with death, by Finn himself.  The bodies of Hnæf and Friðiwulf are honourably burned.

Over the winter, the Danes and their Jutish allies brood over the fall of Hnæf.  Hengest is faced with a conflict of duty: whether to honour the peace-treaty with Finn, or to honour his duty to avenge his fallen lord.  Finally the son of Hunlaf takes a sword ''Hildeleoma'' ("Battleflame") which was probably Hnæf's sword, and lays it in Hengest's lap.  Hengest "does not refuse the world's counsel" (that is, he goes along with what everyone agrees is right) and decides that his loyalty to Hnæf must outweigh his obligation to Finn.  (In any case, Tolkien points out that we do not see Hengest swearing any oath to Finn; we only see Finn swearing oaths to Hengest and the Danes.)  When the spring comes, the Danes sail home and tell the story of the downfall of Hnæf.  They return to Finn's stronghold in force.  Hengest, having remained in Frys-Land under the guise of upholding the terms of the peace-treaty, opens the gates to the invaders and the Danes sack Finn's stronghold, kill Finn and all his men, loot and burn the city and return home, taking Hildeburh with them.

'''Gaur''' ('today' in [[Basque language|Basque]]) was a Basque artistic group founded in 1966 by [[Amable Arias]], [[Rafael Ruiz Balerdi]], [[Nestor Basterretxea]], [[Eduardo Chillida]], [[Remigio Mendiburu]], [[Jorge Oteiza]], [[José Antonio Sistiaga]], and [[José Luis Zumeta]].&lt;ref name="Bilbao"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.museobilbao.com/in/exposiciones/amable-balerdi-basterretxea-chillida-mendiburu-oteiza-sistiaga-zumeta-243|title=Amable, Balerdi, Basterretxea, Chillida, Mendiburu, Oteiza, Sistiaga, Zumeta|publisher=Bilbao Fine Arts Museum|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The avant-guard group, based in [[Gipuzkoa]], Spain, provided the springboard for a wide [[History of the Basques|Basque]] artistic movement with close links to influential social, cultural and political agents in the Basque Country opposed to Franco's dictatorship during the 70s and early 80s. 

The group launched with an exhibition on 28 April 1966 at the Barandiarán Gallery in [[San Sebastián]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dss2016.eu/en/news/item/2630-the-50th-anniversary-of-the-gaur-group-the-barandiaran-gallery-and-the-contemporary-art-in-the-exhibition-1966-gaur-konstelazioak-2016|title=The 50th anniversary of the Gaur Group, the Barandiaran Gallery and the contemporary art in the exhibition 1966 {{!}} Gaur Konstelazioak {{!}} 2016|work=dss2016.eu|publisher=San Sebastian 2016 – Donostia 2016|date=22 January 2016|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalogo.artium.org/dossieres/1/eduardo-chillida/obra/grupo-gaur|title=Grupo Gaur|trans-title=Gaur Group|publisher=Artium|access-date=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It challenged the aesthetic moulds and artistic conventions prevailing during that period in Gipuzkoa, and the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] altogether. The artists founding the movement stirred at the rapid economic and social changes taking place at the moment, the virtually non-existent cultural scene, and the crisis of the Basque collective identity.

It stood out as the most prolific artistic group in a constellation of groups founded across all the Basque Country during the same period that made up the Basque Art School.

[[File:Rom, Domitilla-Katakomben, Der gute Hirte.jpg|thumb|200px|The Good Shepherd, c. 300-350, at the [[Catacombs of Rome#Catacombs of Domitilla|Catacombs of Domitilla]], [[Rome]]]]
The '''Good Shepherd''' ({{lang-el|ποιμήν ο καλός}}, ''poimḗn o kalós'') is an image used in the [[pericope]] of [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#10:1|John 10:1-21]], in which [[Jesus Christ]] is depicted as the Good [[Shepherd]] who lays down his life for his [[sheep]]. Similar imagery is used in [[Psalm 23]]. The Good Shepherd is also discussed in the other gospels, the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], the [[First Epistle of Peter]] and the [[Book of Revelation]].

==Biblical references==
In the [[Gospel of John]], Jesus states "I am the good shepherd" in two verses, {{bibleverse||John|10:11|NIV}} and {{bibleverse-nb||John|10:14|NIV}}.

From {{bibleref|John|10:11-18}} ([[World Hindi Bible|WEB]]):

{{quote|I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn't own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them. The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn't care for the sheep. I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I'm known by my own; even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep. I have other sheep, which are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd. Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again. No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father.}}

This passage is one of several sections of John's Gospel which generate division among the Jews:
:"There was a division again among the Jews because of these sayings. Many of them said, 'He has a demon and is mad. Why do you listen to Him?' Others said, 'These are not the words of one who has a demon'. ({{bibleverse||John|10:19-21|NKJV}})

[[File:Good shepherd 02b close.jpg|thumb|[[Allegory]] of Christ &lt;ref&gt;"The figure (...) is an allegory of Christ as the shepherd" Andre Grabard, "Christian iconography, a study of its origins", {{ISBN|0-691-01830-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|Good Shepherd]], 3rd century.]]
Jesus Christ is also compared to a shepherd in {{bibleverse||Matthew|2:6|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|9:36|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|25:32|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|26:31|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|6:34|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|14:27|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||John|10:2|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Hebrews|13:20|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|2:25|NIV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Peter|5:4|NIV}}, and {{bibleverse||Revelation|7:17|NIV}}.

==Parable or metaphor?==
Several authors such as Tinto, Barbara Reid, Arland Hultgren or Donald Griggs comment that "parables are noticeably absent from the Gospel of John".&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Reid, 2001 ''Parables for Preachers'' {{ISBN|0-8146-2550-9}} page 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arland J. Hultgren, 2002 ''The Parables of Jesus'' {{ISBN|0-8028-6077-X}} page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald L. Griggs, 2003 ''The Bible from scratch'' {{ISBN|0-664-22577-2}} page 52&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' article on Parables:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11460a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Parables|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There are no [[parables]] in St. John's Gospel" and according to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' article on Gospel of St. John:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=John, Gospel of St |volume=15 |pages=452–458 |first=Friedrich |last=von Hügel}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Here Jesus' teaching contains no parables and but three allegories, the [[Synoptic Gospels|Synoptists]] present it as parabolic through and through."

==Early Christian art==
The image of the Good Shepherd is the most common of the symbolic [[Depiction of Jesus|representations of Christ]] found in [[early Christian art]] in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], before Christian imagery could be made explicit. The form of the image showing a young man carrying a lamb round his neck was directly borrowed from the much older pagan [[kriophoros]] (see below) and in the case of portable statuettes like the most famous one now in the [[Pio Cristiano Museum]], [[Vatican City]] (right), it is impossible to say whether the image was originally created with the intention of having a Christian significance.  The image continued to be used in the centuries after Christianity was [[Edict of Milan|legalized in 313]]. Initially it was probably not understood as a portrait of Jesus, but a symbol like others used in Early Christian art,&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Syndicus; ''Early Christian Art''; pp. 21-3, Burns &amp; Oates, London, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases may also have represented [[the Shepherd of Hermas]], a popular Christian literary work of the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Faces of Jesus'' by Robin M. Jensen, ''Bible Review'', 17.8, October 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Early Christian Art'' by Robin M. Jensen, Routledge, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by about the 5th century, the figure more often took on the appearance of the conventional depiction of Christ, as it had developed by this time, and was given a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] and rich robes,&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 130-131&lt;/ref&gt; as on the [[apse]] [[mosaic]] in the church of [[Santi Cosma e Damiano]] in Rome, or at [[Ravenna]] (right). Images of the Good Shepherd often include a sheep on his shoulders, as in the Lukan version of the [[Parable of the Lost Sheep]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter |last=Lowrie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0fwCGTzbMQ0C&amp;pg=PA69 |title=Art in the Early Church |publisher= Pantheon Books|year= 1947 |isbn= 1-4067-5291-6|page= 69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pagan symbolism ==
{{main|Kriophoros}}
[[File:Hermes crioforo.jpg|thumb|upright|Late Roman marble copy of the ''[[Kriophoros]]'' of [[Calamis (5th century BC)|Kalamis]] ([[Museo Barracco]], Rome)]]

In ancient Greek cult, [[kriophoros]] or ''criophorus'' (Κριοφόρος), the "ram-bearer" is a figure that commemorates the solemn sacrifice of a [[Sheep|ram]]. It becomes an [[epithet]] of [[Hermes]]: ''Hermes Kriophoros''.

In two-dimensional art, ''Hermes Kriophoros'' transformed into the Christ carrying a lamb and walking among his sheep: "Thus we find philosophers holding scrolls or a Hermes Kriophoros which can be turned into Christ giving the Law ([[Traditio Legis]]) and the Good Shepherd respectively".&lt;ref&gt;Peter and Linda Murray, ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Art and architecture'', p.&amp;nbsp;475.&lt;/ref&gt; The Good Shepherd is a common motif from the [[Catacombs of Rome]] (Gardner, 10, fig 54) and in [[sarcophagus]] reliefs, where Christian and pagan symbolism are often combined, making secure identifications difficult.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8953">{{Muhammad}}

Very few texts in [[Judaism]] refer to or take note of the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]]. Those that do, generally reject Muhammad's proclamation of receiving divine revelations from [[God]] and label him instead as a [[false prophet]].

==Background==
In Judaism, prophets were seen as having attained the highest degree of holiness, scholarship, and closeness to God and set the standards for human perfection. The [[Talmud]] reports that there were more than a million prophets, but most of the prophets conveyed messages that were intended solely for their own generation and were not reported in [[Scripture]]. The Talmud reports that there were prophets among the [[gentile]]s (most notably [[Balaam]], whose story is told in ''[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]'' 22, and [[Job (Bible)|Job]], who is considered a non-Jew by most rabbinical opinions). The prophet [[Jonah]] was sent on a mission to speak to the gentiles of the city of [[Nineveh]].

==References to Muhammad==

In the Middle Ages, it was common for [[Jews|Jewish]] writers to describe Muhammad as ''ha-meshuggah'' ("the [[madman]]"), a term of contempt frequently used in the Bible for those who believe themselves to be prophets.&lt;ref name="Stillman1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman A. Stillman|title=The Jews of Arab lands: a history and source book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFN2ismyhEYC&amp;pg=PA236|accessdate=26 December 2011|year=1979|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|isbn=978-0-8276-0198-7|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=M8o6UZ37ppUC&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism By Ibn Warraq Page 255]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vjFNPT52XjUC&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Legacy of Islamic Antisemitism: From Sacred Texts to Solemn History page 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporaries===
In the 7th century and during the life of Muhammad himself, many Jewish leaders and individual Jews made public their views on him or those who followed, especially but not limited if it concerned their communities. Among others, the old sage and man of letters [[Abu 'Afak]] from the Ubaeda tribe who wrote a poem which would be indicted by Muhammad himself, as warranting the capital sentence by [[assassination]]. The extant of it was preserved in Islamic biography and it may have been less severe,
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Long have I lived but never have I seen
An assembly or collection of people
More faithful to their undertaking
And their allies when called upon
Than the sons of Qayla when they assembled,
Men who overthrew mountains and never submitted.
A rider who came to them split them in two
(saying) "Permitted", "Forbidden", of all sorts of things.
Had you believed in glory or kingship
You would have followed [[Rulers of Saba and Himyar|Tubba]].

The apostle [Muhammad] said, "Who will deal with this rascal for me?"&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Maimonides===
[[Maimonides]] referred to Muhammad as a [[false prophet]] and an [[insane]] man. In his ''[[Epistle to Yemen]]'' he wrote "After [Jesus] arose the Madman who emulated his precursor [Jesus], since he paved the way for him. But he added the further objective of procuring rule and submission [''talb al-mulk''; pursuit of sovereignty] and he invented what was well known [Islam]."&lt;ref name=Roth1994p218&gt;Norman Roth. ''Jews, Visigoths, and Muslims in Medieval Spain: Cooperation and Conflict'', [[Brill Publishers|BRILL]], 1994, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his authoritative work of law the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (Hilkhot Melakhim 11:10–12), Maimonides indicated that nevertheless Muhammad was part of God's plan of preparing the world for the coming of the [[Jewish Messianism|Jewish Messiah]]: "All those words of Jesus of Nazareth and of this Ishmaelite [i.e., Muhammad] who arose after him are only to make straight the path for the messianic king and to prepare the whole world to serve the Lord together. As it is said: 'For then I will change the speech of the peoples to a pure speech so that all of them shall call on the name of the Lord and serve him with one accord' (Zephaniah 3:9)."&lt;ref name=Rudin128-129&gt;[[A. James Rudin]]. ''Christians &amp; Jews Faith to Faith: Tragic History, Promising Present, Fragile Future'', Jewish Lights Publishing, 2010, pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natan'el al-Fayyumi===
[[Natan'el al-Fayyumi]], a prominent 12th-century [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]] rabbi and theologian, and the founder of what is sometimes called "[[Jewish philosophy#Nethan'el al-Fayyumi|Jewish Ismailism]]", wrote in his philosophical treatise ''Bustan al-Uqul'' ("Garden of Wisdom") that God sends prophets to establish religions for other nations, which do not have to conform to the precepts of the Jewish Torah. Nethanel explicitly considered Muhammad a true prophet, who was sent from Heaven with a particular message that applies to the Arabs, but not to the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bustan al-Ukul, by Nathanael ibn al-Fayyumi,'' edited and translated by David Levine, Columbia University Oriental Studies Vol. VI, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gan ha-Sekhalim'', ed. Kafih (Jerusalem, 1984), ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Al-Fayymi's explicit acceptance of Muhammad's prophecy was rare and virtually unknown until recent times beyond his native [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Abraham's children: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in conversation,'' by Norman Solomon, Richard Harries, Tim Winter,  T&amp;T Clark Int'l, 2006, {{ISBN|0-567-08161-3}}, p. 137 ''Netanel's work was virtually unknown beyond his native Yemen until modern times, so had little influence on later Jewish thought.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Midrash===
The [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] [[Midrash]] ''Secrets (Nistarot) of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai'', compares Muhammad, "a prophet sent to [[Ishmael]] according to God's will", to the Jewish [[Jewish eschatology|Messiah]]. According to this text, ascribed to the famous 1st-century sage and mystic [[Simeon bar Yochai]], and apparently written at the beginning of the Muslim conquest or in the 8th century,&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Jerusalem: The Early Muslim Period'', by Joshua Prawer and Haggai Ben-Shammai, NYU Press, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0814766392}}, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad's role as a prophet includes redeeming the Jews from the Christian ("Roman" or "Edomite") oppression and playing a positive role in the messianic process.&lt;ref&gt;''Abraham's children: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in conversation,'' by Norman Solomon, Richard Harries, Tim Winter,  T&amp;T Clark Int'l, 2006, {{ISBN|0-567-08161-3}}, p. 133 ''"Nistarot" places the Muslim conquests in an eschatological context, and implies that Muhammad had a positive role to play in the messianic process.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obscure and indirect references===
One Yemenite Jewish document, found in the [[Cairo Genizah]], suggests that many Jews had not only accepted Muhammad as a prophet, but even desecrated [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] in order to join Muhammad in his struggle. However, some historians suggest that this document, called ''Dhimmat an-nabi Muhammad'' (Muhammad’s Writ of Protection), has been fabricated by Yemenite Jews for the purpose of self-defence.&lt;ref&gt;Yakov Rabkin [http://www.cismor.jp/en/publication/jismor/documents/JISMOR5en_Rabkin.pdf "Perspectives on the Muslim Other in Jewish Tradition"] (126&amp;nbsp;KB)&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of stories from the Islamic tradition about Muhammad entered mainstream Jewish thought incidentally, due to the great cultural convergence in Islamic Spain from the 9th to 12th centuries, known as the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain|Golden Age]] of [[Sephardim|Spanish Jewry]]. For example, Rabbi [[Jacob Joseph of Polonne]], one of the early [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] mystics, wrote that one pious man (''hasid'') taught that the internal struggle against the evil inclination is greater than external battle, quoting [[Bahya ibn Paquda]]'s popular treatise ''[[Chovot HaLevavot]].'' In the [[Judeo-Arabic]] original version of that book, Bahya Ibn Paquda refers to both external and internal battle as [[jihad]] and the "pious man" about whom the story is originally told is Muhammad, though the author does not mention his source by name.&lt;ref&gt;''A Sufi-Jewish Dialogue: Philosophy and Mysticism in Bahya ibn Paquda's Duties of the Heart,'' by Diana Lobel, University of Pennsylvania Press, {{ISBN|0-8122-3953-9}}, p. ix "How does a perennially popular manual of Jewish piety come to be quoting Islamic traditions about the Prophet Muhammad? Muslim Spain of the tenth through twelfth century, known as the "Golden Age" of Hispano-Jewish poetry and letters, is a time of great convergence and cultural creativity."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:11. Labbacallee Wedge Tomb, Co. Cork.jpg|thumb|right| Labbacallee]]
'''Labbacallee wedge tomb''' ({{lang-ga|Leaba Chaillí}} "[[Hag]]'s Bed") is a large pre-historic burial monument, located {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} north-west of [[Fermoy]] and {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} south-east of [[Glanworth]], [[County Cork]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is the largest Irish [[wedge tomb]] and dates from roughly 2300 BC.&lt;ref name="WE"&gt;{{cite book | last=Weir, A| year=1980 |title=Early Ireland. A Field Guide | publisher=Blackstaff Press | location=Belfast | pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Features==
The site has three large capstones which slope downwards towards the back, the largest being {{convert|7.8|m|abbr=on}} long and weighing {{convert|10|t|sigfig=2}}. The gallery below is made up of a large rectangular chamber, with a small one behind it, divided by a slab. The gallery is triple-walled, buttressed at the back by three slabs set parallel to the axis of the tomb. To the front of the gallery are the remains of a large rectangular unroofed antechamber which is wider than the gallery and separated from it by a large slab.&lt;ref name="WE"/&gt; Outside this there was a further row of stones running off at an angle, but few of the original stones remain.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Excavations==
In 1934 excavations revealed a number of inhumations, fragments of a late [[Stone Age]] decorated pot, and fragments of bone and stone.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Local folklore associates the site with the Celtic Hag-Goddess [[Cailleach Bheur]], and during the excavations the site was found to contain the remains of a woman. Although the body had been positioned within one chamber of the tomb, her skull was found in another chamber.

'''Landscape architecture''' is the design of outdoor areas, landmarks, and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioural, or aesthetic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe, Susan Jellicoe, The Landscape of Man: Shaping the Environment from Prehistory to the Present Day {{ISBN|9780500274316}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the systematic investigation of existing social, ecological, and soil conditions and processes in the landscape, and the design of interventions that will produce the desired outcome.  The scope of the profession includes [[landscape design]]; [[site planning]]; [[Stormwater#Stormwater management|stormwater management]]; erosion control; [[natural environment|environmental]] [[ecological restoration|restoration]]; [[park]]s and recreation planning; visual resource management; green infrastructure planning and provision; and private [[estate (land)|estate]] and [[house|residence]] landscape master planning and design; all at varying scales of design, planning and management. A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture is called a [[landscape architect]].

==Definition==
Landscape architecture is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of [[botany]], [[horticulture]], the [[fine art]]s, [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[soil sciences]], [[environmental psychology]], [[geography]], [[ecology]], and [[civil engineering]]. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks, from the design of residential estates to the design of civil [[infrastructure]] and the management of large [[wilderness]] areas or [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of degraded landscapes such as mines or [[landfill]]s. Landscape architects work on structures and external spaces with limitations toward the landscape or park aspect of the design - large or small, [[urban area|urban]], [[suburban]] and [[rural]], and with "hard" (built) and "soft" (planted) materials, while integrating ecological [[Sustainable development|sustainability]].  The most valuable contribution can be made at the first stage of a project to generate ideas with technical understanding and creative flair for the design, organization, and use of spaces. The landscape architect can conceive the overall concept and prepare the master plan, from which detailed design drawings and technical specifications are prepared. They can also review proposals to authorize and supervise contracts for the construction work. Other skills include preparing design impact assessments, conducting environmental assessments and audits, and serving as an expert witness at inquiries on land use issues.

* [[Ecological Design]] any aspect of design that minimizes environmentally destructive impacts by integrating itself with natural processes and [[sustainability]]

Landscape managers use their knowledge of landscape processes to advise on the long-term care and development of the landscape. They often work in [[forestry]], nature [[conservation ethic|conservation]] and [[agriculture]].

Landscape scientists have specialist skills such as [[soil science]], [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology]] or [[botany]] that they relate to the practical problems of landscape work. Their projects can range from site surveys to the ecological assessment of broad areas for planning or management purposes. They may also report on the impact of development or the importance of particular [[species]] in a given area.

Landscape planners are concerned with [[landscape planning]] for the location, scenic, ecological and recreational aspects of urban, rural and coastal land use.
Their work is embodied in written statements of policy and strategy, and their remit includes master planning for new developments, landscape evaluations and assessments, and preparing countryside management or policy plans. Some may also apply an additional specialism such as [[landscape archaeology]] or law to the process of landscape planning.

[[Green roof]] (or more specifically, vegetative roof) designers design extensive and intensive [[roof garden]]s for [[storm water]] management, evapo-transpirative cooling, [[sustainable architecture]], aesthetics, and habitat creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Extensive Vegetative Roofs {{!}} Whole Building Design Guide|url = https://www.wbdg.org/resources/greenroofs.php|website = www.wbdg.org|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Orangerie.jpg|thumb|300px|Orangery at the Palace of Versailles, outside Paris]]
{{Main|History of landscape architecture}}
For the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and [[garden design]] for [[manor houses]], [[palace]]s and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by [[André Le Nôtre]] at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] for King [[Louis XIV of France]] at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. The first person to write of ''making'' a landscape was [[Joseph Addison]] in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by [[Gilbert Laing Meason]] in 1828, and [[John Claudius Loudon]] (1783–1843) was instrumental in the adoption of the term landscape architecture by the modern profession. He took up the term from Meason and gave it publicity in his Encyclopedias and in his 1840 book on the ''Landscape Gardening and Landscape Architecture of the Late Humphry Repton''.&lt;ref&gt;London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of landscape architecture spread from the Old to the New World. The term "landscape architect" was used as a professional title by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in the United States in 1863{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} and 
[[Andrew Jackson Downing]] (1815–1852),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6412257 Find a Grave]&lt;/ref&gt; another early American [[landscape designer]], was editor of ''The Horticulturist'' magazine (1846–52). In 1841 his first book, ''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Adapted to North America'', was published to a great success; it was the first book of its kind published in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Horticulture|url=http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hort/history/159.html|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=24 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716204051/http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hort/history/159.html|archivedate=16 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the latter 19th century, the term landscape architect begun to be used by professional landscapes designers, and was firmly established after [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] and [[Beatrix Farrand|Beatrix Jones (later Farrand)]] with others founded the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA) in 1899. IFLA was founded at [[Cambridge]], [[England]], in 1948 with [[Geoffrey Jellicoe|Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe]] as its first president, representing 15 countries from [[Europe]] and North America. Later, in 1978, IFLA's Headquarters were established in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]].&lt;ref name=IFLAbook&gt;IFLA Past, Present, Future - A publication about the history of IFLA. {{ISBN|3-9522080-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=123501&amp;set=48C9DF56_2_0&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1 UNCESCO Documents and Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iflaonline.org/ The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to urban planning==
[[File:Central park photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|333px|The combination of the traditional landscape gardening and the emerging city planning combined together gave landscape architecture its unique focus. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]  used the term 'landscape architecture' using the word as a profession for the first time when designing the [[Central Park]]. ]]
Through the 19th century, [[urban planning]] became a focal point and central issue in cities. The combination of the tradition of [[History of gardening|landscape gardening]] and the emerging field of urban planning offered Landscape Architecture an opportunity to serve these needs.&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., &amp; de Jong, H. (2013). Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the century, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] completed a series of parks which continue to have a huge influence on the practices of Landscape Architecture today. Among these were [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]], [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and Boston's [[Emerald Necklace]] park system. [[Jens Jensen (landscape architect)|Jens Jensen]] designed sophisticated and naturalistic urban and regional parks for [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and private estates for the Ford family including [[Fair Lane]] and [[Edsel and Eleanor Ford House|Gaukler Point]]. One of the original ten founding members of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] (ASLA), and the only woman, was [[Beatrix Farrand]]. She was design consultant for over a dozen universities including: [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]; [[Yale]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]; and the [[Arnold Arboretum]] for [[Harvard]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Her numerous private [[estate (land)|estate]] projects include the landmark [[Dumbarton Oaks]] in the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, other architects — most notably Ruth Havey and Alden Hopkins—changed certain elements of the Farrand design.

Since this period [[Urban Planning]] has developed into a separate independent profession that has incorporated important contributions from other fields such as [[Civil Engineering]], [[Architecture]] and [[Public Administration]]. Urban Planners are qualified to perform tasks independent of landscape architects, and in general, the curriculum of landscape architecture programs do not prepare students to become urban planners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bulletin of Information for the AICP Comprehensive Planning Examination|url=https://planning-org-uploaded-media.s3.amazonaws.com/legacy_resources/certification/pdf/bulletin.pdf#page=13|website = www.planning.org|quote=There are important distinctions between planners and allied professionals and between planning and related fields. Planners approach problems comprehensively, have a long-range perspective, and deal with unique place-based issues. Although people in related professions (e.g., law, architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, real estate development, etc.) and disciplines (humanities, psychology, etc.) often work with planners, they do not necessarily have the same knowledge base, skillset, and approach.

Landscape architecture continues to develop as a design discipline, and to respond to the various movements in architecture and design throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. [[Thomas Dolliver Church|Thomas Church]] was a mid-century landscape architect significant in the profession. [[Roberto Burle Marx]] in [[Brazil]] combined the [[International style (architecture)|International style]] and native Brazilian plants and culture for a new aesthetic. Innovation continues today solving challenging problems with contemporary design solutions for master planning, landscapes, and gardens.

[[Ian McHarg]] was known for introducing environmental concerns in landscape architecture.&lt;ref name=Corbett&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corbett|first1=John|title=Ian McHarg: Overlay Maps and the Evaluation of Social and Environmental Costs of Land Use Change|url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/23|publisher=Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ozio&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ozio|first1=Ron|title=Obituary: Ian McHarg Dies|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/university-pennsylvania-prof-ian-mcharg-dies|website=Penn News|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=4 June 2014|date=6 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place. This system became the foundation of today's Geographic Information Systems (GIS). McHarg would give every qualitative aspect of the site a layer, such as the history, hydrology, topography, vegetation, etc.  GIS software is ubiquitously used in the landscape architecture profession today to analyze materials in and on the Earth's surface and is similarly used by Urban Planners, Geographers, Forestry and Natural Resources professionals, etc.

==Profession==
In many countries, a professional [[institute]], comprising members of the professional community, exists in order to protect the standing of the profession and promote its interests, and sometimes also regulate the practice of landscape architecture. The standard and strength of legal regulations governing landscape architecture practice varies from nation to nation, with some requiring licensure in order to practice; and some having little or no regulation. In [[Europe]], [[North America]], parts of [[South America]], [[Australia]], [[India]] and [[New Zealand]], landscape architecture is a regulated profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oala.on.ca |title=The Ontario Association of Landscape Architects |publisher=Oala.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===
Since 1889, with the arrival of the French architect and urbanist landscaper [[Carlos Thays]], recommended to recreate the National Capital's parks and public gardens, it was consolidated an apprentice and training program in landscaping that eventually became a regulated profession, currently the leading academic institution is the [[University of Buenos Aires|UBA University of Buenos Aires]]''"UBA Facultad de Arquitectura, Diseño y Urbanismo"'' (Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism) offering a Bacherlor’s degree in Urban Landscaping Design and Planning, the profession itself is regulated by the National Ministry of Urban Planning of Argentina and the Institute of the [[Buenos Aires Botanical Garden]].

===Australia===
The [[Australian Institute of Landscape Architects]] (AILA) provides accreditation of university degrees and non statutory professional registration for landscape architects. Once recognized by AILA, landscape architects use the title 'Registered Landscape Architect' across the six states and territories within Australia.

AILA's system of professional recognition is a national system overseen by the AILA National Office in Canberra. To apply for AILA Registration, an applicant usually needs to satisfy a number of pre-requisites, including university qualification, a minimum number years of practice and a record of professional experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aila.org.au/iMIS_Prod/AILAWeb/Become_an_AILA_Member/Join/AILAWeb/Join_or_Renew.aspx?hkey=2d670d90-0f9a-49c9-a901-68bc8fd5ef5e]&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape Architecture within Australia covers a broad spectrum of planning, design, management and research. From specialist design services for government and private sector developments through to specialist professional advice as an expert witness.

===Canada===
In Canada, landscape architecture, like law and medicine, is a self-regulating profession pursuant to provincial statute.  For example, Ontario's profession is governed by the Ontario Association of Landscape Architects pursuant to the ''Ontario Association of Landscape Architects Act''.  Landscape architects in Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta must complete the specified components of L.A.R.E (Landscape Architecture Registration Examination) as a prerequisite to full professional standing.

Provincial regulatory bodies are members of a national organization, the [[Canadian Society of Landscape Architects|Canadian Society of Landscape Architects / L'Association des Architectes Paysagistes du Canada]] (CSLA-AAPC), and individual membership in the CSLA-AAPC is obtained through joining one of the provincial or territorial components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csla-aapc.ca/csla-aapc Canadian Society of Landscape Architects Official Site - English]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
AIAPP (Associazione Italiana Architettura del Paesaggio) is the Italian association of professional landscape architects formed in 1950 and is a member of IFLA and IFLA Europe (formerly known as EFLA). AIAPP is in the process of contesting this new law which has given the Architects' Association the new title of Architects, Landscape Architects, Planners and Conservationists whether or not they have had any training or experience in any of these fields other than Architecture.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
In Italy, there are several different professions involved in landscape architecture:
*Architects
*Landscape designers
*Doctor landscape agronomists and Doctor landscape foresters, often called Landscape agronomists.
*Agrarian Experts and Graduated Agrarian experts.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects (NZILA) is the professional body for Landscape Architects in NZ [http://www.nzila.co.nz www.nzila.co.nz].

In April 2013, NZILA jointly with AILA, hosted the 50th International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) World Congress in Auckland, New Zealand.  The World Congress is an international conference where Landscape Architects from all around the globe meet to share ideas around a particular topic.

Within NZ, Members of NZILA when they achieve their professional standing, can use the title Registered Landscape Architect NZILA.

NZILA provides an education policy and an accreditation process to review education programme providers; currently there are three accredited undergraduate Landscape Architecture programmes in New Zealand. Lincoln University also has an accredited masters programme in landscape architecture.

===Republic of Ireland===
The Irish Landscape Institute [ILI] (www.irishlandscapeinstitute.com) is the officially recognized (by the Irish State) professional body representing landscape architects and parks professionals, in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The ILI was formed in 1992 by the merger of the ILHI (Institute of Landscape Horticulture of Ireland) and the IILA (Irish Institute of Landscape Architects), representing the related disciplines of landscape architecture and landscape horticulture. The Institute currently (October 2017) has a total membership of 160 (approx.) within 7 membership categories (student, graduate, affiliate, parks professional, corporate, fellow, honorary). In the absence of state regulation of the profession or title 'landscape architect', ILI is self-regulating, as for example in its adoption of the trade-marked title, 'Registered Landscape Architect', that is solely permissible for use by corporate members.

At international level, the ILI is a full member of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) through its European Region (IFLA-Europe). The ILI has play a consistent and active role in IFLA and the current president of IFLA-Europe is Irishman and ILI Past President, Mr. Tony Williams MILI.
In the Republic of Ireland, the ILI is a member institute of the Urban Forum, which represents 5 built-environment professional bodies in engineering, architecture, planning, quantity surveying and landscape architecture.

ILI promotes the landscape profession by its accreditation of the master's degree programme in University College Dublin, its certification of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for its members, administration of professional practice examinations, advocacy and lobbying in respect of government policies, guidelines and standards (e.g. the National Landscape Strategy, National Planning Framework, Blue-Green Infrastructure), conferences and seminars, public lectures and design awards.

The profession grew rapidly during the Irish economic boom of the early 21st. century, benefiting from the upsurge in the construction and development sectors and from the States' capital investment in infrastructure. The recession brought a sharp reduction in membership numbers. The profession and ILI has proven resilient with clear evidence of a slow but steady recovery through growth in membership and in employment, since the commencement of economic recovery in 2014.

A key challenge remains: there is still no professional regulation or protection registration of title in Ireland, despite calls for such on successive government by ILI over many years. Therefore, there is no state-guarantee or protection of clients, for example in terms of insuring and verifying educational qualifications, professional indemnity insurance or Continuing Professional Development (CPD) of those claiming to be landscape architects. Notwithstanding this, there is a growing awareness in some important sectors (e.g. government departments, media, construction, tourism) of the profession. This is due - to some degree - to the ongoing work of the ILI in promoting the benefits of landscape architecture to Irish society, economy and environment.

Landscape architects in Ireland work in private practice, public sector bodies at local government level and in some state bodies (e.g. transport, national heritage) and in academia. The demand for their professional services is often associated with public infrastructure projects (e.g. roads, motorways, renewable energy facilities, water treatment plants, etc.), Blue-Green Infrastructure (planning, design and management of parks, greenspaces, amenity trees) and with construction projects related to land use developments, principally residential, commercial and mixed-use developments in urban landscapes.

Landscape architects are employed in design of:  green infrastructure, public realm, institutional/medical/industrial campuses and settings, parks, play facilities, transport (road/rail/cycle/port) corridors, retail complexes, residential estates (including plans for remediation of now-abandoned housing 'ghost' estates), village improvements, accessibility audits, graveyard restoration schemes, wind farms, wetland drainage systems and coastal zones.
They are also significantly employed in preparation/review of statutory impact assessment reports on landscape, visual and ecological impacts of planning proposals.

=== South Africa ===
In May 1962, Joane Pim, Ann Sutton, Peter Leutscher and Roelf Botha (considered the forefathers of the profession in South Africa) established the Institute for Landscape Architects, now known as the Institute for Landscape Architecture in South Africa (ILASA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilasa.co.za/&lt;/ref&gt; ILASA is a voluntary organisation registered with the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession. It consists of three regional bodies namely, Gauteng, KwaZula-Natal and the Western Cape. ILASA’s mission is to advance the profession of landscape architecture and uphold high standards of professional service to its members, and to represent the profession of landscape architecture in any matter which may affect the interests of the members of the Institute. ILASA holds the country’s membership with The International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA).

In South Africa, the profession is regulated by The South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession (SACLAP),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saclap.org.za/&lt;/ref&gt; established as a statutory council in terms of Section 2 of the South African Council for the Landscape Architectural Profession Act – Act 45 of 2000. The Council evolved out of the Board of Control for Landscape Architects (BOCLASA), which functioned under the Council of Architects in terms of The Architectural Act, Act 73 of 1970. SACLAP’s mission is to establish, direct, sustain and ensure a high level of professional responsibilities and ethical conduct within the art and science of landscape architecture with honesty, dignity and integrity in the broad interest of public health, safety and welfare of the community.

After completion of an accredited under-graduate and/or post-graduate qualification in landscape architecture at either the [[University of Cape Town]] or the [[University of Pretoria]], or landscape technology at the [[Cape Peninsula University of Technology]], professional registration is attained via a mandatory mentored candidacy period (minimum of two years) and sitting of the professional registration exam. After successfully completing the exam, the individual is entitled to the status of Professional Landscape Architect or Professional Landscape Technologist.We also can study landscape architect in various FET institution.

===United Kingdom===
The UK's professional body is the [[Landscape Institute]] (LI). It is a [[charter]]ed body which accredits landscape professionals and university courses. At present there are fifteen accredited programmes in the UK. Membership of the LI is available to students, academics and professionals, and there are over 3,000 professionally qualified members.

The Institute provides services to assist members including support and promotion of the work of landscape architects; information and guidance to the public and industry about the specific expertise offered by those in the profession; and training and educational advice to students and professionals looking to build upon their experience.

In 2008, the LI launched a major recruitment drive entitled "I want to be a Landscape Architect" to encourage the study of Landscape Architecture. The campaign aims to raise the profile of landscape architecture and highlight its valuable role in building [[sustainable communities]] and fighting [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/media/CCPositionStatement.php |title=CC Position Statement |first= |last= |work=landscapeinstitute.org |year=2011 |accessdate=30 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613043428/http://www.landscapeinstitute.org/media/CCPositionStatement.php |archivedate=13 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

In the United States, Landscape Architecture is regulated by individual state governments. For a landscape architect, obtaining licensure requires advanced education and work experience, plus passage of the national examination called [[The Landscape Architect Registration Examination (L.A.R.E.)]]. Several states require passage of a state exam as well. In the United States licensing is overseen both at the state level, and nationally by the Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards (CLARB).  Landscape architecture has been identified as an above-average growth profession by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and was listed in ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'''s list of Best Jobs to Have in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2009/12/28/landscape-architect-2.html |title=Career Advice and Guide for Job Searches - US News Business |publisher=Money.usnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national trade association for United States landscape architects is the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]].

The '''Laren School''' is the name of an [[art colony]] located in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] village, [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]], in [[Het Gooi]] near [[Hilversum]]. The artists of this offshoot of the [[Hague School]] chose the inhabitants of Laren and the surrounding landscape as the subject of their art.

Discovered by painter, [[Jozef Israëls]], the area around Laren School was distinguished by its unspoiled beauty and diversity of landscape, and was considered ideally situated by many members of the Hague School. After 1898, it was rediscovered by young artists known as the second generation of the Laren School, their work extending far into the 20th century. This colony of artists is significant in [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Impressionism]], being seen as part of this international movement. The ideas fostered in the area found their way to the [[Modernism|Modernist]] art movement.

==The first generation of the Laren School==
[[File:Max Liebermann - Flachsscheuer in Laren - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Max Liebermann]] (1887): ''Flax Barn at Laren ''.]]

The industrialisation of Rotterdam, Amsterdam and other regions of the [[Netherlands]] affected landscapes that had remained untouched for centuries. Many of these landscapes disappeared, and with them, the inspiration for earlier landscape and genre painting.

After 15 years of fame, from 1855 to 1870, the artists of the [[Oosterbeek#Oosterbeek School|Oosterbeek School]] were looking for a new place to paint. Around 1870, the painter, Jozef Israëls, discovered the village of Laren. He visited often with his son, [[Isaac Israëls|Isaac]], whom he instructed in outdoor painting. His enthusiasm for Laren, and the surrounding landscape and agricultural activity, was infectious, and other artists from the [[Pulchri Studio]] began to join him. [[Albert Neuhuys]] and [[Anton Mauve]] were the first to follow Israëls  in 1877 and in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Nina Lübbren: ''Rural artists colonies in Europe, 1870 to 1910'', Manchester University Press, 2001. p 170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/aria/aria_artists/00017202?page=1&amp;lang=en&amp;context_space=&amp;context_id= '' Anton Mauve - Rijksmuseum Amsterdam '']&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Hein Kever]], [[Willem Steelink, Jr.|Willem Steelink]], Hendrik Valkenburg, [[Wally Moes]], Etha Fles, [[Arina Hugenholtz]] and Tony Offermans [[Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch]], [[Willem Roelofs]], and [[Max Liebermann]] (the first foreign painter at the Laren School and an old friend of Israël) came to work in Laren. Thus, the Laren School as an [[artist colony]] was born. Some of these painters settled in the region; their Laren-inspired works were shown to the public at the Pulchri Studio and affiliated galleries.

[[File:Anton Mauve - The Return of the Flock, Laren - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anton Mauve]] (1886-87): ''The Return of the Flock, Laren'' - Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.]]

Neuhuys concentrated on farm life as a [[genre]] subject, but the others turned to the [[landscape]]. Art historians describe this as the Laren Style, which is regarded as part of the [[Hague School]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Around 1885, the first colony ceased to produce new work based on Laren and its environs.

==The second generation of the Laren School==
[[File:Mondriaan De Molen.jpg|thumb|[[Piet Mondriaan]] (1917): ''The Windmill'' - Steddijk Museum, Amsterdam.]]
Around 1898, Laren was rediscovered by a group of young painters who gave new life to the Laren Style school of painting for the next 40 years, including [[:nl:Otto van Tussenbroek]], [[Evert Pieters]], [[Bernard de Hoog]], Hendrik Theodorus de Court Onderwater, [[:nl:Andre Broedelet]], [[Salomon Garf]], [[Franz Deutmann]], Lammert van der Tonge, [[:nl:Jaap Dooijewaard]] and Bernard Pothast. Most of these were genre painters in the agricultural tradition, like Neuhuys. However some were landscape painters, notably [[:nl:Cornelis Vreedenburgh]], [[:nl:Gerrit van Blaaderen]] and [[:nl:Frans Langeveld]].

The second generation of the Laren School diverged, one group following the traditions of the Hague School while the rest painted in the new style of [[Impressionism]], embracing modernity with an enthusiasm now considered typical of the Netherlands.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In 1903, under the initiative of August Johannes le Gras (1864–1915), the [[Gooi]]sche Painters Association, "De Tien" (The Ten), was founded. This group organized exhibitions across the country to create new opportunities for the work of its members. The Ten included [[:nl:Derk Meeles]], [[:nl:Toon de Jong]], [[:nl:David Schulman]] and [[:nl:Emanuel van Beever]].

[[File:Singer museum laren.jpg|thumb|The Singer Museum of Laren.]]
[[William Singer|William Henry Singer]], an American painter and art collector, came to Laren in 1901. In 1911, he built a villa called ''De Wilde Zwanen'' (The Wild Swans) which, after World War II, was converted into the [[Singer Laren|Singer Museum]] and concert hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollandtheaterweb.de/theater/2/nord-holland/173/laren/269/singer-theater ''Holland Theaterweb''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930172356/http://www.hollandtheaterweb.de/theater/2/nord-holland/173/laren/269/singer-theater |date=2015-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At De Wilde Zwanen, painters such as [[Co Breman]] and [[Ferdinand Hart Nibbrig]] differed from the mainstream of Impressionism, painting in the style of [[Pointillism]] and [[Luminism (Impressionism)|Luminism]]. [[:nl:Johan Coenraad Heyen Brock]] specialized in the representation of factories. For modernists, like [[Piet Mondriaan]], [[Jan Sluyters]] and [[Leo Gestel]], this studio and its location were significant in the direction they took in their art.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In 1921, the Association of Visual Artists, Laren, [[Blaricum]], was founded by Co Breman. In 1935, the Gooische Painters Association fractured, and the members formed several distinct groups. August Johannes le Gras specialised in African landscapes and animals, [[Jan Pieter Veth]] in [[Portraiture|portraits]], [[:nl:Douwe Komter]] in [[still life]].

Today, the Singer Museum exhibits works of the Laren School.

==About the name==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}

From art collectors and authors, the term is often used for all painters active in Laren, and as shorthand for the continuation of the [[Hague School]] and the [[Oosterbeek School]]. Several founders of this artist colony — Jozef Israëls and his son, Isaac, along with Albert Neuhuys and Anton Mauve — were already known as Hague painters.

This artists of the Laren School are linked together by the relationship between their ideas of art, style and techniques. In Laren, the countryside was the main theme of the landscape painters. Therefore, the term 'Laren' applies primarily as a place of landscape painting. The lightening of color, by adding gold yellow, red and blue, is essential to the Laren School. Another striking feature of Laren School paintings is the romantic view of social life in this tough region of Gooiland.

'''''Lights in the Dusk''''' ({{lang-fi|'''Laitakaupungin valot'''}}) is a 2006 [[Cinema of Finland|Finnish]] [[comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] written, produced, and directed by [[Aki Kaurismäki]]. Starring Janne Hyytiäinen, [[Ilkka Koivula]], and [[Maria Järvenhelmi]] , the film was presented at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4336339/year/2006.html|title=''Laitakaupungin valot'' (''Lights in the Dusk'')|accessdate=8 July 2015|work=[[Cannes Film Festival|Festival de Cannes (Archives: 2006, Selections)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the last installment in Kaurismäki's "[[Finland]]" trilogy after ''[[Drifting Clouds (film)|Drifting Clouds]]'' ([[1996 in film|1996]]) and ''[[The Man Without a Past]]'' ([[2002 in film|2002]]).

The film is about a security guard who is set up in a robbery by a [[femme fatale]] who exploits his gullibility and loyalty. Classical music is used as background throughout much of the film, including excerpts from the work of the famous [[Swedes|Swedish]] tenor [[Jussi Björling]].

It has been argued that the film deals with the ways in which "[c]apitalism has painted the town red, just a different shade of red from its socialist connotations," as well as that "rock is so important to the director that a number of his males, including Koistinen, favor a 50s, greasy, sweptback hair style, to go along with their love of rock 'n' roll (definitely a reminder of how rock was the way to rebel in socialist countries)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708221342/http://www.austinfilm.org/page.aspx?pid=3277|url=http://www.austinfilm.org/page.aspx?pid=3277|title=''Lights in the Dusk'' (''Laitakaupungin valot''): Written, Produced, Directed, and Edited by Aki Kaurismäki|last=Nafus|first=Chale, Director of Programming, [[Austin Film Society]]|publisher=[[Austin Film Society]]|access-date=8 July 2015|archivedate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Koistinen (Janne Hyytiäinen) is a lonely nightwatchman tasked with guarding a shopping mall. He attempts to socialize, but is treated coldly by his manager and subjected to mocking by his colleagues. While he is drinking alone in a bar, he catches the eye of some criminals headed by Lindholm ([[Ilkka Koivula]]) who learn of his occupation. Koistinen's only human contact is the grill vendor Aila ([[Maria Heiskanen]]) to whom he outlines his plans of starting his own company.

While at work, Koistinen notices a dog left outside a pub without water. While he is taking a break, Mirja ([[Maria Järvenhelmi]]) approaches him, saying he seems lonely. They agree to go on a date together. Returning from his break, Koistinen meets a young boy in front of the pub and asks if he knows the owners of the dog. Despite the boy's warning, Koistinen confronts the owners in the pub and is beaten off-camera.

Koistinen and Mirja go on a date. They talk little, and at a concert Koistinen watches as Mirja goes dancing on her own with other men. Despite this, they agree to meet again. Koistinen returns to Aila's grill and talks about his evening. Insulted, Aila asks him to leave and closes shop. Meanwhile, Mirja meets with Lindholm for her payment and ridicules Koistinen. Lindholm informs his contacts of an "open-door day."

Koistinen seeks a loan to start his own business, but is harshly refused at the bank due to his insufficient education and lack of guarantors. Later, Mirja unexpectedly joins Koistinen while he is taking his rounds. While Koistinen explains the mall's security system, Mirja memorizes the security code he uses. She gives the code to Lindholm, who tells her to start cooling the fake relationship off.

Mirja meets Koistinen at his place, but abruptly leaves when he attempts to put his arm around her. Koistinen begins to drink heavily, and ends up at Aila's grill. Aila walks him home and puts him to bed.

At work, one of Koistinen's colleagues mockingly asks about his successes with women. Koistinen grabs the man, but stops himself from striking him and goes to his rounds. Mirja meets him and asks him to come and talk. Koistinen signs off and leaves with Mirja in his car. Mirja drugs Koistinen and passes his keys to one of Lindholm's contacts. Using Koistinen's keys and security code, the thieves rob a jewellery store at the mall.

The police question Koistinen, but he claims to have been alone and drunk. He is released due to lack of proof, but is fired from his job. On Lindholm's insistence, Mirja meets with Koistinen at his apartment once again to plant evidence. Koistinen notices her hiding the evidence, but does not stop her and lets himself be arrested by the police. He is sentenced to two years in prison.

Koistinen initially remains lonely in prison, tearing up a letter Aila sends him. Just as Koistinen begins to have some contact to other inmates, he is released a year early on parole. He finds lodgings at a night shelter and gets a job as a restaurant's dishwasher. He runs into Aila, but soon excuses himself. However, Aila comes to see him at the night shelter and asks about his plans for the future. When Koistinen says he plans to open a garage once he's back on his feet, she congratulates him for not losing hope. They agree to see each other again.

Koistinen sees Mirja and Lindholm at the restaurant where he is working, but does not confront them. Lindholm calls up the head waitress and tells about Koistinen's criminal record, which results in him being fired immediately. Koistinen gets a knife from the night shelter and returns to the restaurant. As Lindholm and Mirja are leaving, he attacks Lindholm, but only manages to cut his hand while being disarmed and subdued by Lindholm's thugs. The thugs offer to kill Koistinen, but Lindholm refuses, saying he is a businessman and not a murderer. The young boy who warned Koistinen earlier sees the thugs take him away and finds Aila. They discover the badly beaten Koistinen in the harbour, along with the dog Koistinen attempted to help earlier. Aila offers to get help but Koistinen asks her to stay. When she asks him not to die, Koistinen replies "I won't die yet" and puts his hand on hers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18747">This is a list of '''scholarly publishing "[[sting operation]]s"''' such as the [[Sokal affair]]. These are nonsense papers that were accepted by an [[academic journal]] or [[academic conference]]; the list does not include cases of [[scientific misconduct]]. The intent of such publications is typically to expose shortcomings in a journal's [[Academic peer review|peer review]] process or to criticize the standards of [[Predatory open access publishing|pay-to-publish]] journals.

==Mathematics==
* In 2012, the [[open-access journal]] ''Advances in Pure Mathematics'' accepted a nonsense paper produced by the computer program Mathgen. Although the paper was accepted, the "author" declined to pay the journal's $500 publishing fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eldredge|first1=Nate|title=Mathgen paper accepted!|url=http://thatsmathematics.com/blog/archives/102|website=That's Mathematics!|accessdate=21 May 2017|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer science==
* A paper randomly generated by the [[SCIgen]] program was accepted without peer-review for presentation at the 2005 [[World Multiconference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics]] (WMSCI). The conference announced the prank of having accepted the article as not [[peer review]]ed, despite none of the three assigned peer-reviewers having submitted an opinion about its fidelity, veracity, or accuracy to its subject. The three [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] graduate students who wrote the hoax article said they were unaware of the [[Sokal Affair]] until after submitting their article. Subsequently, numerous other papers generated by SCIgen have been published in scientific journals or accepted for presentation at scientific conferences.
* In December 2013, a [[Pune]]-based software professional submitted a bogus paper titled "use of cloud-computing and social media to determine box office performance", which was accepted by the [[Bhubaneswar]]-based Research Forum for their ICRIEST-AICEEMCS International Conference. The paper's introductory section itself cautioned that it contained some "gibberish" that was auto-generated by software. One section of the paper also includes 19 lines about the 1970s Bollywood film ''[[Sholay]]'', and 19 lines from ''[[My Cousin Vinny]]'', a 1992 Hollywood film. The incident highlighted a practice where "poor quality papers are accepted from students who are then asked to pay a few thousand rupees to participate in the conferences". After that the management of the event retracted the paper and apologized publicly. The Secretary in an interview described the acceptance as a human error of the coordinators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1140103/jsp/frontpage/story_17747127.jsp|title=Throw in F-word and become paper tiger|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2014 an Australian computer scientist Dr Peter Vamplew submitted a paper to the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology (IJACT) after being angered that the journal would not take his email off its mailing list. The article, titled "[[Get me off your fucking mailing list|Get me off your fucking mailing list]]", consisted of the phrase "Get me off your fucking mailing list" being repeated for the entirety of the article body. The journal requested the researcher to "add some more recent references and do a bit of reformatting" saying that the article's "suitability for the journal was excellent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/25/journal-accepts-paper-requesting-removal-from-mailing-list|title=Journal accepts bogus paper requesting removal from mailing list|last=Safi|first=Michael|date=2014-11-25|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics==
* Christoph Bartneck, an [[Associate Professor]] in [[Information Technology]] at New Zealand's [[University of Canterbury]], was invited to submit a paper to the 2016 International Conference on Atomic and Nuclear Physics organised by [[ConferenceSeries]]. With little knowledge of nuclear physics, he used [[iOS]]'s auto-complete function to write the paper, choosing randomly from its suggestions after starting each sentence,&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt; and submitted it under the name Iris Pear (a reference to [[Siri]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]).&lt;ref name="HIT"&gt;{{cite web|title=iOS Just Got A Paper On Nuclear Physics Accepted At A Scientific Conference|first=Christoph|last=Bartneck|date=20 October 2016|accessdate=22 October 2016|publisher=[[University of Canterbury]] Human Interface Technology (HIT) Lab, New Zealand|url=http://www.bartneck.de/2016/10/20/ios-just-got-a-paper-on-nuclear-physics-accepted-at-a-scientific-conference/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sample sentence from the abstract for the resulting manuscript was: "The atoms of a better universe will have the right for the same as you are the way we shall have to be a great place for a great time to enjoy the day you are a wonderful person to your great time to take the fun and take a great time and enjoy the great day you will be a wonderful time for your parents and kids"&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt; and the 516-word abstract contained the words "good" and "great" a combined total of 28 times (and is available online).&lt;ref name="HIT"/&gt; Despite making no sense, the work was accepted within three hours of submission and a conference registration fee of US$1099 requested.&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HIT"/&gt; The incident was compared to an earlier case where Peter Vamplew, from [[Federation University Australia|Federation University]] in Victoria, had a manuscript containing only the phrase "[[Get me off your fucking mailing list]]" accepted by the [[International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology]].&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"&gt;{{cite news|title=Nonsense paper written by iOS autocomplete accepted for conference|first=Elle|last=Hunt|date=22 October 2016|accessdate=22 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/oct/22/nonsense-paper-written-by-ios-autocomplete-accepted-for-conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Journal accepts bogus paper requesting removal from mailing list|first=Michael|last=Safi|date=25 November 2014|accessdate=22 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/25/journal-accepts-paper-requesting-removal-from-mailing-list}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ConferenceSeries is associated with the [[OMICS Publishing Group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bogus British Company "Accredits" OMICS Conferences|first=Jeffrey|last=Beall|authorlink=Jeffrey Beall|url=https://scholarlyoa.com/2016/10/13/bogus-british-company-accredits-omics-conferences/#comment-425306|date=13 October 2016|accessdate=22 October 2016|publisher=[[Scholarly Open Access]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106003123/https://scholarlyoa.com/2016/10/13/bogus-british-company-accredits-omics-conferences/#comment-425306|archivedate=6 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produces [[open access journals]] widely regarded as [[predatory open access publishing|predatory]], and has been accused of moving into "predatory meetings".&lt;ref name="Beall"&gt;{{cite web|title=OMICS Goes from "Predatory Publishing" to "Predatory Meetings" |first1=Jeffrey |last1=Beall |first2=Richard |last2=Levine |authorlink1=Jeffrey Beall |authorlink2=Richard Levine |url=https://scholarlyoa.com/2013/01/25/omics-predatory-meetings/ |date=25 January 2013 |accessdate=22 October 2016 |publisher=[[Scholarly Open Access]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605042104/https://scholarlyoa.com/2013/01/25/omics-predatory-meetings/ |archivedate=5 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartneck said he was "reasonably certain that this is a money-making conference with little to no commitment to science," given the poor quality of the review process and the high cost of attendance.&lt;ref name="HuntNonsense"/&gt;

==Chemistry==
* "[[Who's Afraid of Peer Review?]]": In 2013 [[John Bohannon]] wrote in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' about a "[[sting operation]]" he conducted in which he submitted "a credible but mundane scientific paper, one with such grave errors that a competent peer reviewer should easily identify it as flawed and unpublishable", to 304 open-access publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bohannon|first=John|title=Who's Afraid of Peer Review?|journal=Science|date=4 October 2013|volume=342|issue=6154|pages=60–65|doi=10.1126/science.342.6154.60|pmid=24092725|bibcode=2013Sci...342...60B}}&lt;/ref&gt; 157 journals accepted the paper. There have been some objections to the sting's methodology and about what conclusions can be drawn from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Mike|title=Anti-tutorial: how to design and execute a really bad study|url=http://svpow.com/2013/10/07/anti-tutorial-how-to-design-and-execute-a-really-bad-study/|work=Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week|accessdate=14 October 2013|author2=Matt Wedell|author3=Darren Naish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Kevin|title=The big picture about peer-review|url=http://blogs.library.duke.edu/scholcomm/2013/10/10/the-big-picture-about-peer-review/|work=Scholarly Communications @ Duke|publisher=Duke University Libraries|accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
* John McLachlan, a professor of medical education, hoaxed the Jerusalem Conference on Integrative Medicine in 2010 with invented nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6979|title=Integrative medicine and the point of credulity|date=8 December 2010|publisher=The BMJ|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
* In 2007 [[Tomasz Witkowski]] published a fake article in the psychology journal ''[[Charaktery]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witkowski|first1=Tomasz|title=Psychological Sokal's Style Hoax|journal=The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practices|date=2011|volume=8|issue=1|pages=50–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witkowski|first1=Tomasz|last2=Zatonski|first2=Maciej|title=Psychology Gone Wrong: The Dark Sides of Science and Therapy|date=2015|publisher=BrownWalker Press|isbn=1-62734-528-0|pages=259–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Randi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Randi|first1=James|title=Sokal Re-created|url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/142-swift-december-21-2007.html#i3|publisher=JREF|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other science bloggers covered the hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grivan|first1=Ray|title=Polish Sokal-style hoax|url=http://poorpothecary.blogspot.com/2007/11/polish-sokal-style-hoax.html|website=Poor Pothecary|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wanderer in the country of blindfolded|title=Polish 'Sokal hoax'|url=http://countryofblindfolded.blogspot.com/2007/11/polish-sokal-hoax.html|website=Random journeys through Science|date=6 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interdisciplinary and cultural studies==
* The [[Sokal affair]]: [[Alan Sokal]], a [[physics]] professor at [[New York University]] and [[University College London]], wrote a paper titled "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity]&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed that [[quantum gravity]] is a social and linguistic construct. The paper was published in the ''Social Text'' spring/summer 1996 "[[Science Wars]]" issue. At that time, the journal did not practice [[academic peer review]] and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html|title=Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity|accessdate=3 April 2007|last=Sokal|first=Alan D.|date=28 November 1994|work=[[Social Text]] #46/47 (spring/summer 1996)|publisher=[[Duke University]] Press|pages=217–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9607/mst.html|title=Mystery science theater|author1=Bruce Robbins|author2=Andrew Ross|date=July 1996}}. Reply by Alan Sokal.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of its publication in May 1996, Sokal revealed in ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' that the article was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|title=A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies|last=Sokal|first=Alan D.|work=''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]''|date=5 June 1996|accessdate= 2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Michel Maffesoli#Sociétés hoax|Sociétés hoax]]: Using a false identity, Manuel Quinon and Arnaud Saint-Martin submitted an intentionally inept and absurd article on the "[[Autolib']]", a small rentable car in [[Paris]], to [[Michel Maffesoli]]'s ''Sociétés'' journal. The article was deliberately incoherent and plastered with liberal quotes and references to Maffesoli and other postmodern thinkers. The article was duly "reviewed" by two people, before being accepted and published in ''Sociétés'' without any substantial editing.
* In May 2017, [[Peter Boghossian]] and James Lindsay published an absurd paper in the [[open access journal]] ''Cogent Social Sciences'' which argued that the penis is best understood not as a biological organ but rather as a social construct. The paper came to an absurd conclusion that the conceptual penis is a "driver behind much of climate change" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindsay|first=Jamie|last2=Boyle|first2=Peter|date=|title=The conceptual penis as a social construct|url=http://www.skeptic.com/downloads/conceptual-penis/23311886.2017.1330439.pdf|journal=Open Access Journal|volume=|page=6|pages=|via=Skeptic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The authors' goal was to expose bias towards extreme ideologies in social science and gender studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boghossian|first1=Peter|last2=Lindsay|first2=James|title=The conceptual penis as a social construct: a Sokal-style hoax on gender studies|url=http://www.skeptic.com/reading_room/conceptual-penis-social-contruct-sokal-style-hoax-on-gender-studies/|website=Skeptic|accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the sting operation argue that it did not demonstrate the existence of such biases, despite the authors' goals of doing so. Phil Torres of ''Salon'', for example, argued that the sting shows only that academic journals that require authors to pay for papers to be published have a financial inclination "to accept papers regardless of quality." He also noted that none of the editorial board members of ''Cogent Social Sciences'' have expertise in gender studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.salon.com/2017/05/22/why-the-conceptual-penis-hoax-was-a-bust-it-only-reveals-the-lack-of-skepticism-among-skeptics/ |title=Why the “Conceptual Penis” hoax was a bust: It only reveals the lack of skepticism among skep... |last=Torres |first=Phil |date=2017-05-22 |work=Salon |access-date=2018-01-23 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James E. McWilliams]] criticized the authors' motives, writing that "Boghossian and Lindsay are white men working in the most male-dominated academic fields (philosophy and math) attempting to humiliate through bullying one of the few academic fields dominated by women. In our current political climate—thriving as it does on shamelessness and humiliation—this scenario, as the motives become increasingly transparent, only calls for kind of scrutiny and understanding that gender studies can provide."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://psmag.com/education/the-hoax-that-backfired-how-an-attempt-to-discredit-gender-studies-will-only-strengthen-it |title=The Hoax That Backfired: How an Attempt to Discredit Gender Studies Will Only Strengthen It |last=McWilliams |first=James |date=2017-05-31 |work=Pacific Standard |access-date=2018-01-23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [["Grievance Studies" affair]] (also referred to as the ""Sokal Squared" Scandal (or Hoax)" by the news media): Over 2017-2018 Helen Pluckrose, James A. Lindsay and [[Peter Boghossian]] wrote 20 hoax articles; at the time the hoax stopped, four papers had been published, three had been accepted but not yet published, seven were under review, and six had been rejected. The papers all focused on what the authors called “grievance studies" related to race, gender, sexuality and other forms of identity. The hoax was revealed and halted after one of the papers in the [[feminist geography]] journal ''[[Gender, Place and Culture]]'' was criticized on social media, and then on ''[[Campus Reform]]'', which led a ''Wall Street Journal'' editorial writer to investigate and report on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schuessler |first1=Jennifer |title=Hoaxers Slip Breastaurants and Dog-Park Sex Into Journals |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/04/arts/academic-journals-hoax.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 4, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper, which was in the process of being retracted when the ''Wall Street Journal'' story broke, referred to dog parks as "petri dishes for canine [[rape culture]]". The report also described a paper published in ''[[Affilia]]'' which contained a reworded excerpt from ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-news-comes-to-academia-1538520950|title=Fake news comes to academia|author=Jillian Kay Melchior|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=2018-10-02|accessdate=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
* Dr. [[Maarten Boudry]], a [[Philosophy|philosopher]], in 2012 persuaded two [[theology]] conferences to accept abstracts composed of meaningless [[word salad]] as a paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/dispatches/2012/09/28/philosopher-pulls-a-sokal-on-theology-conferences/|title=Philosopher Pulls a Sokal on Theology Conferences|author=Ed Brayton|work=Dispatches from the Culture Wars|accessdate=3 October 2014|date=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.newhumanist.org.uk/2012/09/atheist-philospher-pulls-soakl-style.html|title=Atheist philosopher pulls Sokal-style hoax on theology conference|work=New Humanist Blog|publisher=Rationalist Association|accessdate=15 September 2014|date=25 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928014134/http://blog.newhumanist.org.uk/2012/09/atheist-philospher-pulls-soakl-style.html#|archive-date=2012-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Memorandum of conversation''' (abbrev.: '''MEMCON''') and also '''memorandum of a conversation''' and '''memo to the file''' refers to a method of contemporaneous documentation of a conversation in the form of a [[memorandum]] used by the [[federal government of the United States|United States federal government]].&lt;Ref name=memcon /&gt;&lt;Ref name=memfile /&gt;

''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' characterized the use of the tactic in the U.S. government as among "the most basic ways of Washington".&lt;ref name=memfile /&gt;

==Method==
Typically an individual will document the events of the conversation as soon as possible after the occurrence.&lt;ref name=memcon /&gt; All material statements and discussed items are quoted and described as accurately as possible soon after the discussion and filed for future reference.&lt;ref name=memcon&gt;{{citation|first=Lawrence|last=O'Donnell|authorlink=Lawrence O'Donnell|work=[[The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell]]|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=May 16, 2017|title=MEMCON}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memcons function as documentation of historical events, such as conversations between heads of state and law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name=ford&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/guides/findingaid/Memoranda_of_Conversations.asp|title=Summary Description|work=National Security Adviser. Memoranda of Conversations, 1973-1977|publisher=[[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum]]|access-date=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific developments discussed, the time of the meeting, location, and individuals in attendance are all documented in-depth within the memo.&lt;ref name=memcon /&gt;&lt;ref name=memfile&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/a-brief-history-of-the-memo-to-the-file/article/2008086|first=Eric|last=Felten|title=A Brief History of the 'Memo to the File'|date=May 17, 2017|work=[[The Weekly Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Department of Justice]] attorneys and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] [[special agent]]s commonly make use of memoranda of conversation.&lt;ref name=memcon /&gt; A majority of intermediate-rank managerial staff and bureaucrats within the U.S. federal government consistently make use of the method. The creation of a memorandum of understanding allows federal employees to memorialize and keep a record of their conversations and transactions.&lt;ref name=memfile /&gt;

Memoranda to file are used in investigations in the private sector. For example, the [[fraud]] unit of a large corporation may use memoranda to file, to report individual interviews and significant telephone conversations. Generally, "the memorandum will show the name of the author, date of preparation, the case name or number, and the specific subject covered. It will also contain the detailed narrative of the event, interview, or other investigative activity described and should be written as close in time as circumstances permit to those events."&lt;ref name=sennewald&gt;{{citation|first1=Charles A.|last1= Sennewald|first2=John K.|last2= Tsukayama|title=The Process of Investigation: Concepts and Strategies for Investigators in the Private Sector|edition=4th|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]|year=2015|pages=189-90|isbn=978-0128001660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{wikisource|Memorandum of Conversation, by the Officer in Charge of Korean Affairs in the Office of Northeast Asian Affairs July 9, 1951}}
Former Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and subsequently Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, [[Brent Scowcroft]], who served as such in the U.S. presidential administration of [[Gerald R. Ford]], kept copious documentation of his meetings in the form of memorandum of conversation.&lt;ref name=ford /&gt; He would take handwritten notes, and immediately have them transcribed in typewritten format with the assistance of his staff from the [[United States National Security Council]].&lt;ref name=ford /&gt; The [[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum]] contains over 1,000 such memorandum of conversation documents relating to the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon]] and [[Presidency of Gerald Ford]], mainly related to [[national security of the United States]].&lt;ref name=ford /&gt;

'''Ocotlán de Morelos''' is a town and [[Municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] in the state of [[Oaxaca]], about 35&amp;nbsp;km south of the center of the city of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] along Highway 175.
It is part of the [[Ocotlán District, Oaxaca|Ocotlán District]] in the south of the [[Valles Centrales de Oaxaca|Valles Centrales Region]].&lt;ref name="MexDesOax"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Quintanar Hinojosa |first=Beatriz  |date=August 2007 |title=Ocotlán |journal=Guía México Desconocido: Oaxaca |volume= 137  |pages=30–31  |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ipn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cecoax.ipn.mx/Revista/2009/febrero/contenido/images/pdf/28.pdf |title=Ocotlan de Morelos Oax.

The name Ocotlan is from [[Nahuatl]] and means "among the [[ocote]] trees" with the appendage "de Morelos" added in honor of [[José María Morelos y Pavón]]. During the colonial period the area was known as Santo Domingo Ocotlán due to the Dominican friars who created a monastery here dedicated to [[Saint Dominic]]. The [[Zapotec languages|Zapotec]] name for the area is "Lachiroo" which means "large valley" although some Zapotecs in the [[Tlacolula de Matamoros|Tlacolula]] area called it "Guelache" which means "plaza of the valley".&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:HallOcotlanLibrary.JPG|thumb|left|Hall on upper level of the former monastery]]
The ethnicity of the first populations of this area is not known, but one of the earliest settlements is a site called Tortolita, located two km from the modern town center.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; When the Spanish arrived, the settlement had about 2,000 inhabitants, which is why the monastery was eventually founded here.&lt;ref name="redes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://redesdelconocimiento.com/foro/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=42:valles-centrales&amp;id=191:ocotlan-de-morelos&amp;Itemid=109&amp;lang=es |title= Ocotlan de Morelos |year=2008  |work= Redes del Conocimiento  |publisher= Redes del Conocimiento y Redes Educativas |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1538, the bishopric sent Dominicans to found a parish. The monastery was founded in 1555 and called Santo Domingo de Ocotlán. The official founding of the town by Diego Hernandez Domingo Luis and Juan Vazquez also occurred in 1555.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; The complex was never finished because the local people also worked in the mines established nearby.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;
By the 18th century, Octolan has eight small neighborhoods including one called Santa María Tocuela (the oldest) and San Juan Chilatece in which the market was founded.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="puso"/&gt;

During the Mexican War of Independence, Morelos camped here for three days on his way to Acapulco. Ocotlan was officially declared a town in 1875.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

In 1916, forces loyal to [[Venustiano Carranza]] successfully defended the town from an attack led by General Macario Hernandez.  Ocotlan was officially declared a city in 1926.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

Since the [[Mexican Revolution]], the city has been mostly quiet but the current construction of a superhighway linking the city of Oaxaca has been bringing changes to the area. The road called Camino Real a San Juan was recently paved, and event that drew the attendance of the governor of Oaxaca. Other newly paved roads include Calle Industria, Calle Francisco Villa and Calle Ayuntamiento. The new paving is meant to relieve traffic congestion on the roads to [[Ejutla de Crespo]] and the city of Oaxaca by providing alternate routes for current and future traffic.&lt;ref name="puso"/&gt;

[[2006 Oaxaca protests|In 2006, the social uprisings that affected much of Oaxaca]] affected Ocotlán. Much of the social unrest centered around the mines that are located in the municipality and consequences continue to this day. A mining labor leader from the area, Napolean Gomez Urrutia, living in Vancouver, is seeking asylum in Canada after the Mexican government asked for his extradition. He is accused of fraud, criminal associated and other offences associated with the social uprisings. Before he left for Canada, Gomez Urrutia was demanding an investigation into the deaths of 65 workers at a coal mine in the area.&lt;ref name="mines"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexico seeks extradition of exiled labour leader |first=Marina |last=Jimenez |url= http://www.minesandcommunities.org/article.php?a=9061 |newspaper= Toronto Globe and Mail |location=Toronto |date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, protesters from several communities in the municipality blocked a highway to demand the cancellation of an arrest warrant against residents who opposed the operation of a mine and demand talks to close the La Trinidad mine. The mine belongs to a Mexican-Canadian company called Cuxcatlan. Protesters claim the mine is polluting their lands. The protesters were supported by Section 22 of the SNTE and [[APPO]].&lt;ref name="protestan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Protestan pobladores contra instalación de mina en Oaxaca |url= http://www.cminoticiasoaxaca.com/Desarrollo/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=1%3Anoticias&amp;id=3091%3Aprotestan-pobladores-contra-instalacion-de-mina-en-oaxaca&amp;option=com_content |agency=CMI Noticias |newspaper=CMI Noticias |location=Mexico |date=June 18, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Residents protest against mine installation in Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cerrar"&gt;{{cite news |title= Demandan cerrar mina en Oaxaca |first= Octavio |last= Vélez Ascencio |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/06/18/index.php?section=estados&amp;article=031n2est |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=June 19, 2009 |page=31 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Demanding closure of mine in Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unrelated controversy in 2008 involved child pornography charges against the Colegio Guadalupe school. Implicated are several parents and photographer Norberto Dionisio Martinez. The photographs in question involved partially nude women, men and children in a classroom at the school. Angry parents have protested and sued the school although those involved claimed no pornographic acts were involved.&lt;ref name="demandan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Demandan a padres que denunciaron abusos contra sus hijos en escuela católica de Oaxaca |first= Octavio |last= Vélez Ascencio |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/08/28/index.php?section=estados&amp;article=036n1est |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=August 28, 2008 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Parents demand prosecution of abuses against their children in a Catholic school in Oaxaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The city==
[[File:KioskOcotlan.JPG|thumb|left|Kiosk in the main plaza]]
The city can seem like an ordinary and even empty town at first glance.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt; However, because of its geographic location on the south end of the Central Valleys region of Oaxaca, the city is a distribution center for local towns and smaller cities such as [[Santa Lucía Miahuatlán]]. It is also a point of transit for those traveling between the state capital and the coast, a role that will be enforced with the completion of the new modern highway.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; One reason the area is relatively quiet is that for many years, until recently, its churches, monastery, plazas and gardens lay unkempt against the effects of the sun and time, as well as vandalism. Most of the restoration work was sponsored by artist Rodolfo Morales, a native of Ocotlán.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;

The city's main attraction is the Temple and Ex-convent of Santo Domingo de Guzmán.  The complex was constructed in various stages between the 16th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="MexDesOax"/&gt;  The construction of the monastery was halted on several occasions due the lack of manpower, due to the discovery of mines nearby such as Santa Catarina.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;  The main vault, [[apse]], [[choir (architecture)|choir]] and [[sacristy]] of the church were not finished until 1669. The pillars of the cloister were begun at this time as well, but were never finished.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;

[[File:CourtyardChurchOcotlan.JPG|thumb|Courtyard of monastery with church behind]]
From then until the early 19th century, much of the complex was poorly maintained and fell into ruins. Starting in 1804, the Dominicans worked to rehabilitate the building, with attempts continuing until the complex was appropriated by the federal government during the [[Reform War|Reform Laws]]. Ocotlan was one of the last towns in Oaxaca to still have friars in residence in the 19th century but by 1855, the last one had left.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;  By 1885, the monastery area was completely abandoned, but the church was still functioning and remaining in relatively good condition.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;

[[File:OcotlanJuanEv.jpg|thumb|left|''Santo'' of Saint John, from the Chapel of the Señor de la Sacristia]]After it was no longer used as a monastery, the complex has several uses, including that of a prison, where inmates made crafts. In the latter 20th century, the Rodolfo Morales Foundation restored and converted the monastery space into a museum, which contains one room with works by Morales, one room with Oaxaca crafts and one room with artwork from the colonial period. There are also sound and book libraries. In the courtyard where the old pillory is, are held cultural events and photography shoots.&lt;ref name="MexDesOax"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;   The church was also restored by the foundation, but maintains its religious function.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

The church is fronted by a very large [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] fenced by a stone wall. The main facade has two bodies and a crest with both [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] elements. The first body contains the door arch and the second is marked by the choir window. Both bodies are flanked by columns with [[Ionic order]] capitols. The columns extend up the facade and have profuse vegetative decoration. At the top, there is a shell. In the interior is the Chapel of the Senor de la Sacristia, which is decorated in Neoclassical style.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; In both the church and the chapel are found a large number of colonial-era ''santos'' (statues of saints), many executed in fine polychrome and well preserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aug.edu/augusta/santos/ocotlan/index.html Santos in Oaxaca's Ancient Churches: Santo Domingo Ocotlán]. Retrieved 2012-04-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MuniPalExpoOctolan.JPG|thumb|left|Municipal palace]]
The municipal palace has a sober Neoclassic facade built with pink stone, with columns and pediments.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; The main feature are the arches which rest on columns with rectangular bases, forming portals. It was designed to be a focus point for social interaction.&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; The main feature of the interior is the mural work done in the council chambers by Rodolfo Morales in the 1950s, when he was a young man. The mural work depicts scenes from the history of Ocotlán as well as landscapes and representative scenes such as the [[Traditional fixed markets in Mexico|municipality markets]], mining and agriculture. Unfortunately, this work does not receive the care it deserves as the chambers have been used for storage as well as meetings.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; This palace was constructed to commemorate the Centennial of Mexican Independence which occurred in 1910,&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; and was completed in 1913.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;
[[File:PatioMoralesHouseOcotlan.JPG|thumb|Courtyard of the Morales house]]
The Rodolfo Morales house is a mansion from the 18th century which he rescued and lived in. Today, the building is a cultural center with an open-air theatre, which can seat 200 people, galleries of work by local artists and a computer center. All activities and resources here are offered free of charge.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fundacion"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fcrom.org.mx/es/fundacion/fundacion.html |title= Fundación Cultural Rodolfo Morales A.C.  |publisher= Fundación Cultural Rodolfo Morales A.C.  |location=Ocotlan de Morelos, Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The house is located just north of the main square and preserves a number of Morales personal effects, including collages.&lt;ref name="MexDesOax"/&gt; The building is also home to the Fundación Cultural Rodolfo Morales, A. C (Rodolfo Morales Cultural Foundation), which  is a private, nonprofit organization which promotes education and culture in the Ocotlan District of the state of Oaxaca. The Foundation realizes restorations, the maintenance and conservation of architectural monuments, paintings and sculptures and trains young people in restoration work. The foundation was created in 1992 by Rodolfo Morales.&lt;ref name="fundacion"/&gt;
The Octolan railroad station was built along the old Ferrocarril San Jerónimo to San Pablo Huixtepec line in 1906. In 1909, a second platform was built.&lt;ref name="ferrocarril"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sic.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=fnme&amp;table_id=132&amp;estado_id=20 |first= |work=Ferrocarril de Mexico |title= Ocotlán |publisher=CONACULTA |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of important traditions are maintained in the community. The feast of the Virgin of Ocotlán is celebrated on 15 May. Most of the festivities take place on the main square of the town with live music and regional food, especially [[tamale]]s and [[atole]]. The feast of the Señor de la Sacristia is celebrated on the third Sunday in May. One old tradition that is still maintained is a dancing procession to bring the bride and groom their wedding gifts to their new home.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;
However, the most important tradition is the weekly Friday market day ([[tianguis]]), which is one of the oldest and largest in the Central Valleys region of Oaxaca. Produce and products from surrounding towns are available as well as manufactured products.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; Market day is not just buying and selling for rural and indigenous communities, it is a festive ritual which has been held regularly for thousands of years, attracting both locals and families from small outlying villages to both buy and sell. It is an opportunity for many to socialize with distant neighbors. Market day begins very early for both residents and those who travel to the town to sell.&lt;ref name="ipn"/&gt; Many products such as plants, flowers, fruit, [[lime (material)|lime]] for tortillas, live animals, fabric, ceramics, baskets, knives, saddles, hats, rope, [[alebrije]]s, traditional footwear and drinks such as [[mezcal]] and tejate.&lt;ref name="ipn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; Many of the products are the crafts produced by other towns in the Central Valleys region of Oaxaca, such as  textiles of [[Jalietza]], and [[San Antonino Castillo Velasco]] and the alebrijes of [[San Martín Tilcajete]].&lt;ref name="redes"/&gt; Prepared regional specialties are also offered here and the adjacent permanent municipal market. Some of the traditional foods here include several types of [[mole (sauce)|mole]] (negro, rojo, Amarillo, coloradito and more), chichilo, [[tasajo]], tamales in banana leaves and tacos with [[chapulines]] (fried grasshoppers). Another favorite is ice cream in flavors such as nut, [[opuntia|cactus fruit]], [[guanabana]], [[horchata]] and others. Sweet breads such as "mamones" "rosquitas" "marquezotes" and coconut tortillas are popular as well.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; Most of the food products are locally made, including chapulines, animal crackers made with piloncillo and ice cream.&lt;ref name="ipn"/&gt; 

The eighth campus of the Nova Universitas University, part of the SUNEO system, was inaugurated by Oaxaca governor [[Ulises Ruiz Ortiz]] in the city. The college focuses on providing educational opportunities to indigenous populations. Professors give classes both in person at the campus and provide distance learning through big screens in remote classrooms with special monitors to allow student-teacher dialogue. The distance learning scheme allows students in Ocotlan to study with professors from other parts of the state and even attend classes offered in foreign countries. The first degrees offered are Computer Science and Agricultural Science. The school also offered adult and remedial education.&lt;ref name="puso"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nova"&gt;{{cite press release |title= Inauguró Ulises Ruiz campus Nova Universitas de Ocotlán de Morelos |publisher=State of Oaxaca |date=February 10, 2010 |url= http://www.oaxacacomunicacionsocial.gob.mx/prensa/1-comunicados/215-inauguro-ulises-ruiz-campus-nova-universitas-de-ocotlan-de-morelos- |language=Spanish |trans-title=Ulises Ruiz inaugurates Nova Universitas campus of Ocotlan de Morelos |accessdate=April 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has a [[tuna (music)|tuna ensemble]] called the "Tuna Universitaria Santo Domingo de Guzman." This group organizes recitals such as the one in December 2009 for Christmas, inviting other tuna ensembles. The ensemble was founded in 1978 with the objective of preserving the music and traditions associated with the musical style and receives funding from Oaxaca state as well as from private sources.&lt;ref name="tuna"&gt;{{cite news |title= Recital navideño en Ocotlán de Morelos |first= Edgar |last= Leyva |url= http://www.diariodespertar.com.mx/cultura/25389-Recital-navideo-Ocotln-Morelos.html |newspaper= Diario Despertar |location=Oaxaca |date=December 24, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Christmas recital in Ocotlan de Morelos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts and handcrafts==

===Rodolfo Morales===
[[File:MorelosShrineOcotlanMonastery.JPG|thumb|150px|Shrine to Morales at entrance to museum/monastery]]
The town is intimately linked with the life of painter Rodolfo Morales. He has depicted it in his works and has worked to save many of its historic and architectural treasures.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt; The artist's work is devoted to images from this hometown, including local churches, indigenous women, religious procession and others.&lt;ref name="inconforme"&gt;{{cite news |title= Grandes Maestros del Siglo 20 / Rodolfo Morales: De mirada inconforme |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=May 11, 2003 |page=3 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Great Masters of the 20th Century/Rodolfo Morales:From a non-conformist's perspective }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic Julio Cesar Schara states that Ocotlan is a down without grace or major heroes but Morales reinvented the area with his own imagination, painting Neoclassic palaces, angels, fairies to express how he felt about the place.&lt;ref name="reinventa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Evocan 26 artistas el Ocotlan de Morales |first=Omar |last=Garcia |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=May 8, 2002 |page=4 |language=Spanish |trans-title=26 Artists evoke Ocotlan del Morales }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his last works called "Mercados" depicts market scenes from the town painted on columns.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;

Rodolfo Morales’ career as an artist developed in fits and starts.&lt;ref name="inconforme"/&gt; In the 1950s, Morales was commissioned to do the mural work in the municipal palace of Ocotlan, painting it with historical and current scenes related to the municipality. Much of this mural work shows similarities to mural work done by Diego Rivera.&lt;ref name="delcampo"&gt;{{cite news |title= ENTRE PARÉNTESIS / ¿Morelos o Morales? |first=David |last= Martin del Campo |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=April 15, 2008 |page=9 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Between parenthesis/Morelos or Morales? }}&lt;/ref&gt; From that time to the 1970s, Morales remained in obscurity, teaching art privately and for a [[UNAM]] affiliated preparatory school. In the 1970s, his work was discovered by Mexican painter [[Rufino Tamayo]], when Morales was in his 50s.&lt;ref name="inconforme"/&gt; This later work was more surreal than that of the mural he painted when he was younger.&lt;ref name="delcampo"/&gt;  From the time of his discovery by Tamayo until 1986, Morales continued to work at the preparatory school even though his work was being sold in Europe, Mexico and the United States.&lt;ref name="inconforme"/&gt;&lt;ref name="delcampo"/&gt; In 1986, Morales retired from teaching to paint full-time. The production from this time period brought him fame and fortune, allowing him to sponsor civic projects in his hometown.&lt;ref name="delcampo"/&gt; In 1992, he established the Rodolfo Morales Foundation dedicated to fomenting the culture of Oaxaca and supporting the youth of Ocotlan. The artist died in 2001.&lt;ref name="inconforme"/&gt; Much of the restoration work in the monastery and church were done by Morales himself, including feminizing the angels and making the faces more solemn.&lt;ref name="delcampo"/&gt;
While Morales is Ocotlán's best known creative mind, the town has been associated with crafts for generations. Some of the crafts still practiced here include basketry, textiles in the form of [[rebozo]]s and other traditional clothing embroidered in silk thread, blade making, saddlemaking and miniatures in lead. The town is known for its red clay pottery, which is often painted in various colors.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt; Octolan is part of a stretch of road on which are a number of crafts towns such as San Bartolo Coyotepec, San Martin Tilcajete, Santo Tomás Jlietza and Santa Ana Zegache.&lt;ref name="rescato"/&gt;

[[File:MujerNiñoMEAPO.JPG|thumb|150px|"Mujer con Niño" by Guillermina Aguilar Alcantara at [[San Bartolo Coyotepec|the MEAPO Museum]].]]

===Crafts and artisans===
While the men dominate the rug-weaving and woodcarving industries in Oaxaca, the women reign with their pottery. This is true in Ocotlan as well.&lt;ref name="avazquez"&gt;{{cite news |title=Women in Oaxaca, Mexico, Find Strength through Pottery |first=A. |last=Vazquez |author2= Dai Huynh |newspaper=Knight Ridder Tribune Business New |location= Washington, D.C. |date=December 2, 2002 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known pottery family in Ocotlan is the Aguilar. The dynasty begins with potter Isaura Alcantara Diaz, a potter. Isaura learned the traditional pottery making techniques of the Oaxaca Valley, which was mostly limited to making utilitarian items. She began to experiment with figures and more decorative pieces, with some of her pieces making their way into the Rockefeller collection, but died prematurely at the age of 44. Before she died, she taught potting to her children Josefina, Guillermina, Irene, Concepción and Jesús. Due to their mother's death, the children began working early, with Josefina being only seven. Poverty prevented the children from attending school. Like their mother, they began and mostly made pots and other kitchen utensils but they also worked to develop clay figures.&lt;ref name="lcastillo"/&gt; Over time, these siblings became renowned for their fanciful painted clay figures that celebrate everyday life.&lt;ref name="avazquez"/&gt; Today, these siblings still work and much of the third generation are craftsmen as well. Some, such as Demetrio Garcia Aguilar, are making a name for themselves as well.&lt;ref name="lcastillo"/&gt;

[[Josefina Aguilar]] has been noted for her ceramic work since 1977 when she won the third Premio Nacional de Arte (National Art Prize) in 1977. Later, she would win statewide and other nationwide honors and would show her work internationally in places such as the United States and Europe, and her work can be found around the world.&lt;ref name="lcastillo"/&gt; Guillermina Aguilar Alcantara is known for her nativity scenes, wedding scenes, candle sticks and other works done in clay. She and her sister Irene have also won a number of awards and has exported her wears to over a dozen countries. Much of this exporting success was due to a grant by Fomento Cultural Banamex which allowed the family operation to purchase shipping equipment.&lt;ref name="cptm"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nombra el CPTM a los embajadores de la Marca México |first=Carlos |last=Velazquez Mayoral |newspaper=Economista |location= Mexico City |date=September 15, 2005 |page= |language=Spanish |trans-title=CPTM names ambassadors for the Mexico Brand }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EtchedBladeAguilar.JPG|thumb|125px|left|[[Apolinar Aguilar Velasco]] and one of his blades]]
Another known craftsman is Angel Aguilar, who is known for making knives, swords, machetes and the like using the same techniques as those used in the 16th century. Aguilar began making blades when he was ten, taught by his father and uncle. He is now teaching the craft to the next generation.&lt;ref name="palehorse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://palehorsemex.blogspot.com/2006/12/ocotlan-de-morelos-mexico-steel-worked.html |title=Ocotlan de Morelos, Mexico: Steel worked as in 16th century Toledo, Spain |accessdate=April 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The municipality==
As municipal seat, the city of Ocotlán de Morelos is the government authorities for about forty other localities with the most populous outside the seat being Praxedis de Guerrero (1530), San Pedro Guegorexe (813) and Tejas de Morelos (688). However, over seventy percent of the municipality's population of 19,581 lives in the city proper.&lt;ref name="INEGI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |title=INEGI Census 2005 |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EjXaEdST?url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |archivedate=February 27, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality borders the municipalities of [[Santa Ana Zegache]], [[San Martín Tilcajete]], [[San Juan Chilateca]], [[San Antonino Castillo Velasco]], [[Santiago Apóstol]], [[Ejutla de Crespo]], [[Santa Catarina Minas]], [[San Dionisio Ocotlán]], [[San Pedro Mártir, Oaxaca|San Pedro Mártir]], [[Asunción Ocotlán]], [[San Pedro Apóstol]], [[Magdalena Ocotlán]], [[Santa Inés Yatzeche]] and [[Santa Gertrudis (municipality)|Santa Gertrudis]].&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

The territory's geography varies from mountains to flat valley area with some rolling hills. Principle elevations include Yavitise, and Guevexco which are part of the mountain region located to the east and Santa Catarina Minas and San Miguel Tilquiapam to the west. The main surface water is the Ocotlan River, which is a tributary of the [[Atoyac River (Oaxaca)|Atoyac.]] Other rivers include the Chilana, Santa Rosa, Rio Grande, Riod Chichicapan, San Pablo, Taviche, Atoyac, Guanibay, Rio Bravo, La Garzona, Del Panteon and Paraiso. In addition there are intermittent streams that principally flow during the rainy season. The climate is temperate with some variation in temperature during the year and a moderate rainy season in the summer and early autumn. Most of the municipality's flora and fauna has been disturbed by man, with flat areas converted into farmland or settlements. Forests of pine and ocote still exist in the higher elevations.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

There are deposits of gold, silver, iron, coal, lead, copper, zinc, [[antimony]], [[titanium]], [[asbestos]] and other minerals.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

Most of the population is involved in agriculture (23%), crafts and manufacturing (28%) and commerce (45%). One major crop is the [[castor oil plant]], along with corn, beans and various fruit trees. Livestock includes cattle, pigs, goats and domestic fowl. There is a processing plant which makes vegetable oil, with mezcal and dairy products produced in small workshops. Crafts include textiles and ceramics. Most working in commerce has small family businesses.&lt;ref name="EncMuc"/&gt;

The municipality of Ocotlan de Morelos has 8 municipal agencies of Buenavista, Praxedis de Guerrero, [[Texas De Morelos]], San Cristóbal Ixcatlán, San Felipe Apóstol, [[San Jacinto Chilateca]], San Jacinto Ocotlán, and San Pedro Guegorexe. also has 5 Police Agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/enciclopedia/EMM20oaxaca/municipios/20068a.html|title=OAXACA - Ocotlán de Morelos|website=www.inafed.gob.mx|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ohio Music Education Association''' ('''OMEA''') is the [[Ohio]] [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education#Affiliates|state-level affiliate]] of [[MENC: The National Association for Music Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MENC Federated State Associations|url=http://www.menc.org/about/view/menc-federated-state-associations|year=2009|work=MENC official website|publisher=MENC|accessdate=7 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the 52 federated state affiliates of MENC, the OMEA is the third largest and is one of only two state-level affiliate chartered as a "music education association" rather than a "music educators association."

The OMEA was founded in 1924 in as the '''Ohio School Band Association''' ('''OSBA''') by fourteen band directors "to promote high school band contests" in Ohio.  In 1929, the OSBA changed its name to the '''Ohio School Band and Orchestra Association''' ('''OSBOA''') to reflect its newly expanded emphasis including school orchestras.  In 1932, all aspects of music education were brought in, forming the OMEA.  One of the oldest music education associations in the [[United States]], the OMEA recently celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2007.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Are We?|url=http://www.omea-ohio2.org/WhoAreWe/Who.html|year=2009|work=OMEA official website|publisher=Ohio Music Education Association|accessdate=7 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OMEA is involved at all levels of [[music education]] in Ohio, serving more than 1.8 million public school students from 612 school districts and 51 colleges and universities.  Its mission: "to foster a spirit of collaboration for the mutual benefit of all aspects of music education."&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;  The OMEA continually sponsors both regional and statewide contests.&lt;ref name="Competitions"&gt;{{cite news|author=Saunders, Amy|date=September 22, 2009|title=Pop Culture Helps Elevate Stature of High School, Collegiate Choirs|newspaper=[[The Columbus Dispatch]]|publisher=Dispatch Printing Co.|page=1D - Arts &amp; Life}}

| {{efn|In this touring performance of Todd's 1928 musical comedy, Welles appeared as a detective modeled after [[William J. Burns]]. Welles joined the ensemble in the finale, and he was featured in the number, "Everyone Loves a Fellow Who Is Smiling". [[Joseph McBride (writer)|Joseph McBride]] wrote that "when Welles felt in a particularly festive mood, or wanted to cheer up his sluggish actors, he would burst into a favorite song. It came from ''Finesse the Queen'' … Hearing him warble the tune in a tone of innocent sincerity took the listener back to Welles's semi-mythological youth:&lt;br&gt;''Everyone loves the follow who is smiling,&lt;br&gt;He brightens the day and lightens the way for you —&lt;br&gt;He's always making other people happy&lt;br&gt;Looking rosy when you're feeling awful blue.''"&lt;ref name="McBride"&gt;[[Joseph McBride (writer)|McBride, Joseph]], ''What Ever Happened to Orson Welles?

Those are the first things to be said about the overwhelming play that opened at the St. James last evening. But they hardly convey the excitement of the first performance of a play that represents experience of life and conviction in thought and a production that represents a dynamic use of the stage. … In staging it Mr. Welles picks up the bravura style of the Mercury Theatre where he left it two or three seasons ago. In ten savory scenes, acted on different levels with a resourceful use of the stage, he runs through the narrative, giving motion to static scenes by flares of light and putting ''Native Son'' into its urban environment by a varied use of sound accompaniment. Mr. Welles is a dramatic showman; he likes big scenes, broad sweeps of color and vigorous contrasts in tempo.

The '''International Children’s Art Archive''', popularly known as '''PapaInk''', served as the archival home of children's art between 1999-2006. Prior to its closing, the nonprofit organization's archival website documented and exhibited children's art collections from its own physical holdings as well as presenting works donated or shared by organizations and individuals worldwide. The result was to bring to public view collections that would otherwise remain largely unseen, and to bring together widely dispersed works of children's art in a single, dedicated context.

PapaInk made available an international sampling of historical children's art, works by contemporary children and the childhood work of professional artists. Selected holdings, from important partnerships the organization formed, such as the Jewish Museum in Prague's WWII era Terezín collection and the Christian Children's Fund collection spanning 60 years, provided works of established historical value a long-term broad-based public exposure for the first time through presentation on the organization’s online archive. Other holdings, such as works contributed by nonprofits, businesses, professional artists, educators and young artists themselves, were brought within the purview of historical and contemporary appreciation by virtue of The PapaInk’s exhibition and preservation efforts.

The depth and breadth of the organization’s holdings gave rise to an often noted unique and surprisingly profound experience of children's art which attracted the attention of important arbiters of culture and art such as the New York Times&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/30/technology/online-diary.html NY Times article]&lt;/ref&gt; and Art in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Art in America|date=July 2002|volume=66|issue=702|pages=64|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA87424560&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=20200&amp;it=r&amp;p=GPS&amp;sw=w}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dignity of each piece and each collection was heightened by its placement within—and relationship to – the organization’s substantial, respectfully presented body of children's work. The total effect was a transformed sense of children's art and of children's expressive capacities.
During its years of operation, PapaInk attracted in excess of 12 million visitors to digital archive. As the singularly rich resource of children's expression and experience during its time of operation, PapaInk attracted a world audience of libraries, schools, academicians, parents, children and members of arts communities.

In addition to its collection of children’s art, PapaInk’s online magazine dedicated to parenting contained a wealth of resources, included an eclectic blend of interviews conducted by the organization’s founder Marc Feldman, including interviews with Maurice Sendak (Where The Wild Things Are),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/maurice-sendak/about-maurice-sendak/701/ About Maurive Sendal]&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Kauffman (At Home In the Universe),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.santafe.edu/about/people/profile/Stuart%20Kauffman&lt;/ref&gt; Max Oelschlaeger (The Idea of Wilderness)&lt;ref&gt;http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300053708&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taj Mahal]] (Señor Blues), Watts Whacker (The 500-Year Delta),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lr7xxA2J0y8&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Kellogg (A Rose For Pinkerton),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readingrockets.org/books/interviews/kellogg/&lt;/ref&gt; and Walter Cronkite (CBS News).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/walter-cronkite/about-walter-cronkite/561/&lt;/ref&gt;

PapaInk!'s published interviews were part of its "iPapa Project," a project which PapaInk described as "an independent initiative that seeks to foster the fullest possible involvement by fathers and society in encouraging the creative spirit of children. The project recognizes the critical role that men play in children's lives. Interviews with noted individuals as well as excerpts from thinkers in different disciplines on the topics of fathering and creativity form the heart of this project. Fathering=Life!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PapaInk! - iPapa Project |url=http://www.papaink.org/ipapa/home/index.html |publisher=PapaInk! - iPapa Project |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031202230231/http://www.papaink.org/ipapa/home/index.html |archivedate=December 2, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond engaging the public as viewers and appreciators of children's works, PapaInk provided a venue for young artists, their families and communities to exhibit and preserve their art. The organization also worked with 200+ businesses, nonprofits and libraries to sponsor children's art collections that were displayed and archived on PapaInk. Central to PapaInk's collection development activities was the efforts of a worldwide network of 500+ volunteers who contributed personal and institutional collections, and gathered children's art from their local communities for archival exhibition on PapaInk.  PapaInk provided its archival, display, marketing and PR services at no-cost
In helping to reconstitute the legacy of children's art, PapaInk furthered its vision of a world encouraging of and revitalized by the creative spirit of youth.

==Projects And Calls For Art==

'''...A Sense of Home'''
framed|left|Building A Sense of Home (A PapaInk! - Habitat for Humanity Project)
In 2003, following discussions with PapaInk's founder Marc Feldman and First Lady Rosalynn Carter of [[Habitat for Humanity]], PapaInk issued an international call for Children's Art and Youth Art in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity International and its worldwide affiliates.  
The project, "On the Map: Building a Sense of Home" was designed to bring "together young people's capacity to express a sense of home that is at once practical and visionary."  The stated goal of the project was to:

"...Establish a world historical transcription of home through the art of youth. Working through Habitat for Humanity's global volunteer and affiliate networks and PapaInk's worldwide volunteer base and network of non-profit organizations...involving young people from the widest possible range of communities and cultures...to take part by creating a piece of art that captures their sense of home—lived, wished or imagined.  Through the act of expressing a vision of home, young people give their vision a material force. Brought together in a serious archival setting, young people's articulations form a blueprint for building a shared sense of home grounded in the particulars of individual and community needs and warmed by the universals of comfort and care.   The On the Map: Building a Sense of Home art collection will stand as a dramatic living document that creatively re-maps the familiar terrain of home. It will make young people's expressions a vital part of cultural experience and social engagement. And the positive action the project aims to inspire will expand and deepen the sense of home children and youth carry into the future" (PapaInk Press Release)

'''...When They Were Children'''

In March 2002, PapaInk initiated its innovative and highly successful call for the childhood and early youth art of professional artists.
With the help of a well developed network of partners in the art and culture space, such as the high-traffic site [[World Wide Arts Resources Corp]] and the high-profile arts magazine [[Art in America]], PapaInk's "When They Were Children" became an annual call for the early child and youth artworks of professional artists. As described by PapaInk's founder Marc Feldman, in a press release, project, "Artists worldwide are invited take part in a historic rebuilding and recovery of a vital missing element in the cultural record--the creative expression of childhood."  ""When They Were Children" functions as the spirit and substance of artists' collective creative history, and as a material legacy and imaginative fuel for young artists today." (PapaInk Press Release - March 2002). The call to art was "open to all practicing artists with extant works from childhood or memories of epiphanic moments of early creative discovery. [With] All selected artwork and texts will be exhibited within the "When They Were Children" Collection [...] appearing within the online venue of PapaInk's world-noted archive of historical and contemporary children's art expected to attract over one million visitors in 2003."  (PapaInk Press release - March 2002).  The Project included not only the childhood works of professional artists, but commentaries and childhood writings submitted by the artists, such as Brent Hallard:

''"...I can see the hand move, at first nervous, touching paper, and then, drawing intricate circles within circles and marks inside. The shirt had five buttons showing. And the shirt on the person he had drawn had exactly the same number of buttons. He then, after checking that the number of buttons on paper and shirt correspond, goes on to draw shoes and laces, and later, legs that bend, run, and jump. This boy knew he had discovered in life—and on paper—a secret world." 
''From "The Secret World of Buttons," a narrative about childhood creativity. © Copyright 2002, Brent Hallard. All rights reserved. 
Submitted to PapaInk during the 2002 "When They Were Children" call for art.''''

==PapaInk! - The iCurate Project==

Well in advance of other art sites (whether children or adult oriented), Papaink!'s iCurate program invited for professional and non-professional art curators to "take part in a world historical project to collect and preserve the artwork of children contemporary and past. Children's Art Curators are at the heart of PapaInk's mission to reinject the creative spirit of children into human discourse and everyday life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PapaInk! - iCurate Program |url=http://www.papaink.org/icurator/index.php |publisher=PapaInk.org |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030413193930/http://www.papaink.org/icurator/index.php |archivedate=April 13, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As described by PapaInk!, its "curators work within their local communities around the world to"

"Recognize the artistic accomplishments of children, and honor their works in a historically and culturally meaningful context"
"Rescue and archive children's works of art"
"Assemble collections of children's art that reflect and reinforce children's contributions to community life"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PapaInk! iCurate Program |url=http://www.papaink.org/icurator/index.php |publisher=PapaInk.org |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030413193930/http://www.papaink.org/icurator/index.php |archivedate=April 13, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PapaInk's call for father's day art (papa's day art)'''

"June 2003 -- Call to young artists! Submit artwork related to fathers and father-figures for permanent digital exhibition on PapaInk. The Father's Day Art Collection will recognize and honor the bond between fathers/father-figures and children. Each submitted piece will be included in the collection and displayed to audiences worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call for Papa's Day Art! |url=http://www.papaink.org/icurator/fathers_day.html |publisher=PapaInk.org |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031202221254/http://www.papaink.org/icurator/fathers_day.html |archivedate=December 2, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other holdings, such as works contributed by nonprofits, businesses, professional artists, educators and young artists themselves, are brought within the purview of historical and contemporary appreciation by virtue of PapaInk's exhibition and preservation efforts.

The depth and breadth of PapaInk's holdings give rise to a unique and surprisingly profound experience of children's art. The dignity of each piece and each collection is heightened by its placement within—and relationship to—PapaInk's substantial, respectfully presented body of children's work. The total effect is a transformed sense of children's art and of children's expressive capacities.

More and more people are experiencing this transformation first-hand. PapaInk expects to draw 1.5 million visitors to its digital archive this year alone. As a singularly rich resource of children's expression and experience, PapaInk attracts a world audience of libraries, schools, academicians, parents, children and members of arts communities.

Beyond engaging the public as viewers and appreciators of children's works, PapaInk provides a venue for young artists, their families and communities to exhibit and preserve their art. The organization also works with businesses, nonprofits and libraries to sponsor children's art collections that are displayed and permanently archived on PapaInk. Central to PapaInk's collection development activities are the efforts of a worldwide network of volunteers who contribute personal and institutional collections, and gather children's art from their local communities for archival exhibition on PapaInk.

PapaInk is a core initiative of The Children's Art Legacy Foundation. In helping to reconstitute the legacy of children's art, PapaInk furthers the Foundation's vision of a world encouraging of and revitalized by the creative spirit of youth.&lt;ref name="D-Lib Magazine: The Magazine of Digital Library Research"&gt;{{cite web|title=Featured Collection (June 2003)|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/june03/06featured-collection.html|publisher=Corporation for National Research Initiatives|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New York Times Review'''
"For some, ''children's art'' is an oxymoron. Can the young create museum-worthy art? At PapaInk, the Children's Art Archive (papaink.org), an argument is made for children's art as a neglected part of our cultural heritage.

Founded in 1999 by Marc Feldman, a former philosophy professor, PapaInk displays more than 20,000 children's works of art and plans to triple in size this year. (Its name reflects the role of adults in nurturing children's creativity.) The goal is to build an audience for children's art by digitizing collections scattered across the world and displaying them in context at a central location. (Submissions are also welcome.)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LiCalzi O'Connell|first=Pamela|title=Children's Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/30/technology/online-diary.html|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 30, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internet Scout Review'''
"An amazing resource and unique tribute to the oft under-recognized value of children's art, PapaInk archives and makes available works that otherwise certainly would have been overlooked by everyone but the creators and their immediate loved ones. Founded in 1999 with a mission preserving and posting children's artwork, PapaInk has grown in significance and status ever since. Serving as a crossroads for art sharing and appreciation, the site features several collections, some arranged by theme, others by artists or gallery. Showcasing art from around the world, Papaink is a global forum. Visitors to the site can both view and forward links of what they appreciate to others. Many of the featured works offer detailed captions and descriptions, allowing visitors more intimate glimpses into the lives and minds of the young artists that created them. Convinced that what children see is every bit as valid as what adults do, Papaink is dedicated to helping preserve those visions and all they express."&lt;ref name="Internet Scout"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of Papaink!

'''Paul Mattick Jr.''' (born 1944) is a [[Marxist]] theorist and philosopher.

He is the son of [[council communist]] theoreticians [[Paul Mattick|Paul Mattick Sr.]] (1904-1981) and Ilse Mattick (1919-2009).

Mattick was involved in the council communist group Root and Branch, which sporadically published a magazine/pamphlet series, starting in 1969. Other notable members include [[Jeremy Brecher]], [[Stanley Aronowitz]], and [[Peter Rachleff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Root and Branch Archive |url=//www.labor.iu.edu/LaborHistory/rab/home.html |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041028192535/http://www.labor.iu.edu/LaborHistory/rab/home.html |archivedate=October 28, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Root and Branch"&gt;{{cite book |last=Root and Branch|first=Ed.|title=Root and Branch: The Rise of the Workers' Movements|year=1975|publisher=Fawcett Publications |location=Greenwich, Conn.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mattick obtained his [[PhD]] from [[Harvard]] in 1981. He was previously the editor of the ''International Journal of Political Economy'', and is the author of several books on [[philosophy of language]], [[aesthetics]], and the [[critique of political economy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9593">The '''Prince Philip Designers Prize''' is an annual design recognition given by the [[Chartered Society of Designers]] awarded by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].

It is the longest running design award in the United Kingdom, having been started in 1959 as the '''Prize for Elegant Design'''.&lt;ref name="longest"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/house-and-home/brompton-bike-creator-wins-uks-longestrunning-design-award-1804152.html|title=Brompton bike creator wins UK's longest-running design award|work=Independent|date=16 October 2009|accessdate=2009-10-20|quote=Andrew Ritchie was named the winner of the 50th Prince Philip Design Award}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-fold-up"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8309975.stm|title=Royal award for fold-up bike man|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2009-10-16|accessdate=2009-10-20|quote=The Duke set up the prize, run by the Design Council, in 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The recognition is on the basis of ''a design career which has upheld the highest standards and broken new ground''.&lt;ref name="dc-2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/Design-Council/2/Press/Prince-Philip-Designers-Prize-goes-to-zero-hero-Max-Fordham/|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091115082358/http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/Design-Council/2/Press/Prince-Philip-Designers-Prize-goes-to-zero-hero-Max-Fordham/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-11-15|title=Notes to editors|date=2008-11-12|accessdate=2009-10-20|publisher=Design Council|work=Prince Philip Designers Prize goes to ‘zero hero’ Max Fordham}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 The Duke of Edinburgh stepped down from the prize as he reduced his royal responsibilities in his 90th year.

It was agreed in December 2015 that the Chartered Society of Designers should re-introduce and manage it as a global prize after the [[Design Council]] had ceased in 2011 after managing it for 52 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = https://www.csd.org.uk/awards/prince-philip-designer-prize/|url = https://www.csd.org.uk/awards/prince-philip-designer-prize/|website = www.csd.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many CSD members have received the award over the years including Sir Kenneth Grange CBE PPCSD RDI, David Gentleman and latterly Sir Quentin Blake CBE, FCSD, FRSL, RDI who was awarded the final prize in 2011.

Prince Philip suggested and agreed various changes to the Prize that build on its heritage in order to reflect today’s design profession including opening the Prize to international nominations.

'''Raghurajpur''' is a heritage crafts village out of  [[Puri district]], [[India]], known for its master [[Pattachitra]] painters, an art form which dates back to 5&amp;nbsp;BC in the region and [[Gotipua]] dance troupes, the precursor to the [[Indian classical dance]] form of [[Odissi dance|Odissi]]. It is also known as the birthplace of one of the finest Odissi exponents and Guru, [[Kelucharan Mohapatra]]. Apart from that, the village is also home to crafts like Tussar paintings, palm leaf engravings, stone and wood carvings, wooden, cowdung and papier mache toys, and masks.&lt;ref name=bi&gt;[[#Bo|Bindloss, p. 648]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fr&gt;{{cite news |title=A visitors' delight  |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1924/stories/20021206002208600.htm |publisher=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]] |date=Volume 19 - Issue 24, 23 November – 6 December 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bu, Bundgaard. p. 65]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, after a two-year research and documentation project by [[INTACH]], starting 1998, the village was chosen to be developed as state's first heritage village and developed as a Crafts village, soon the village had an interpretation centre, commissioned artwork on the walls of the artists’ homes and a rest house.&lt;ref name=fr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=HERITAGE: Mural village|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2516/stories/20080815251607400.htm |publisher=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]] |date=Volume 25 - Issue 16 :: 2–15 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also has the distinction of the only place where the traditional decoration called ''Patas'', used under the throne of Lord [[Jagannath]] and on the three chariots during the annual [[Rath Yatra]] festival, that takes place at pilgrimage town of [[Puri]], some 14&amp;nbsp;km away, known for the [[Jagannath Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pattachitra.com/raghurajpur.htm Rajhurajpur - pattachitra]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Behind-the-scene action before the Rath Yatra|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/behindthescene-action-before-the-rath-yatra/44947-3.html|publisher=[[CNN-IBN]]|date=15 Jul 2007|access-date=27 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006222043/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/behindthescene-action-before-the-rath-yatra/44947-3.html#|archive-date=6 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Situated amidst groves of coconut, palm, mango and jack fruit, the main village has two streets with over 120 houses, most decorated with mural paintings, where the painters reside and practice their pattachitra craft, besides many other that practices throughout the village, including traditional masks, stone idols, papier mache, sculptures, wooden toys.&lt;ref name=bi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapsofindia.com/puri/weekend-tours/raghurajpur.html Rajhurajpur] mapsofindia.&lt;/ref&gt; The village also has a series of temples dedicated not only to Bhuasuni, the local deity but also to various [[Hindu]] gods including, Radha Mohan, Gopinath, Raghunath, [[Laxminarayan]] and [[Gouranga]].

Around, 2000 it was developed as a heritage village by [[INTACH]], and soon became a major rural tourist destination of the state, drawing tourist, both domestic and foreign to the village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/11/stories/2007101157960200.htm INTACH to develop village in Ganjam district] ''[[The Hindu]]'', 11 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Villagers were also trained to provide heritage walks to the visitors by the organisation, and has since become a template for heritage tourism in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/culture/AAHM/heritage_guides_training/training_kit/Core_module/English_version.pdf Heritage Guide training] [[UNESCO]], [[Bangkok]].Feb, 2007.

Today it is also the venue of the annual ''Basant Utsav - Parampara Raghurajpur'' (Spring Festival), which was first organized in 1993 under the aegis of State Tourism Department and astern Zonal Cultural Centre, Kolkata, held in the month of February/March and an important tourist draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Raghurajpur gears up for Vasant Utsav  |url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/03/10/stories/2007031005740200.htm |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=10 Mar 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pattachitra==
[[File:Patta Chitra 02.jpg|right|380px|thumb|[[Patta Chitra]] painting]]
The [[pattachitra]] paintings are made over a piece of cloth known as ''Patta'' or a dried palm leaf, which is first painted with a mixture of chalk and gum. Over the prepared surface, colorful and intricate pictures of various Gods, Goddesses, and mythological scenes with ornamentation of flowers, trees and animals are then painted. The paintings on Tussar saris, especially the [[Sambalpuri Saree]] depicting Mathura Vijay, Raslila and Ayodhya Vijay owe their origin to ‘Raghurajpur [[Pattachitra]] paintings’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Where every villager is an artist|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020414/spectrum/main7.htm |publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] |date=14 April 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
It is situated 14&amp;nbsp;km away from Hindu pilgrimage town of [[Puri]], on the southern banks of river Bhargabi (Bhargavi). Visitors from Puri take the [[Bhubaneswar]] road, near Chandanpur, on NH-316, and upon reaching the Chandanpur Bazaar, they can take a right turn to reach Raghurajpur. The village is then around 1.5&amp;nbsp;km from Chandanpur.&lt;ref name=bi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikimapia.org/9354769/Raghurajpur Raghurajpur] [[wikimapia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Romanian Athenaeum''' ({{lang-ro|Ateneul Român}}) is a [[concert hall]] in the center of [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]] and a landmark of the Romanian capital city. Opened in 1888, the ornate, domed, circular building is the city's main concert hall and home of the [[George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra|"George Enescu" Philharmonic]] and of the [[George Enescu]] annual international music festival.

== History ==

In 1865, cultural and scientific personalities such as [[Constantin Esarcu]], [[V. A. Urechia]], and [[Nicolae Creţulescu]] founded the Romanian Atheneum Cultural Society.  To serve its purposes, the Romanian Athenaeum, a building dedicated to art and science, would be erected in Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fge.org.ro/ateneul-roman/ The Romanian Athenaeum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107042923/http://fge.org.ro/ateneul-roman/ |date=2008-01-07 }} on the official site of the George Enescu Philarmonic&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was designed by the [[France|French]] architect [[Albert Galleron]], built on a property that had belonged to the [[Văcărescu family]] and inaugurated in 1888, although work continued until 1897.  A portion of the construction funds was raised by public subscription in a 28-year-long effort, of which the slogan is still remembered today: "Donate one ''[[Romanian leu|leu]]'' for the ''Ateneu''!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotel-bucuresti.com/blog/2015/05/14/ateneul-roman-un-simbol-al-culturii-romanesti/ Page about the Romanian Athenaeum] provides a detailed description of the scenes from Romanian history portrayed in the frescoes of the Atheneum. {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 1919, the Atheneum was the site of the conference of leading Romanians who voted to ratify the unification of [[Bessarabia]], [[Transylvania]], and [[Bukovina]] with the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] to constitute [[Greater Romania]].

Extensive reconstruction and restoration work has been conducted in 1992 by a Romanian construction company and restoration painter Silviu Petrescu, saving the building from collapse.  The 9 million Euro required were contributed in equal shares by the government and the [[Council of Europe|Council of Europe Development Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructiv.ro/arhiva/2003/06_iunie/curent_cuprins1.html 1992 reconstruction work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041107040331/http://www.constructiv.ro/arhiva/2003/06_iunie/curent_cuprins1.html |date=2004-11-07 }} includes an excellent image of the inside of the dome during construction. {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building and facilities ==

[[File:Flickr - fusion-of-horizons - Ateneul Român (4).jpg|300px|thumb|right|Romanian Athenaeum]]
The overall style is [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]], with some more [[Romanticism|romantic]] touches.  In front of the building there is a small park and a statue of Romanian poet [[Mihai Eminescu]].

Inside, the ground floor hosts an ornate conference hall as large as the [[auditorium]] above; the auditorium seats 600 in the stalls and another 52 in loge seating.

A 75-sqm long and 3-m wide [[fresco]] by [[Costin Petrescu (painter)|Costin Petrescu]] decorates the inside of the circular wall of the concert hall.  Painted using the ''al fresco'' technique, the piece depicts the most important moments of Romanian history, starting with the conquest of [[Dacia]] by Roman emperor [[Trajan]] and ending with the realization of [[Greater Romania]] in 1918.

Recognized as a symbol of Romanian culture, the building has been inscribed in 2007 on the list of the [[European Heritage Label|Label of European Heritage]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nato.mae.ro/index.php?lang=en&amp;id=31&amp;s=23698&amp;arhiva=true Romanian Athenaeum awarded Label of European Heritage], Romania's Permanent Delegation to NATO&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saint Jerome Writing''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] master Michelangelo Merisi da [[Caravaggio]] in 1607 or 1608, housed in the Oratory of [[St John's Co-Cathedral]], [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]. It can be compared with Caravaggio's [[Saint Jerome Writing (Borghese) (Caravaggio)|earlier version]] of the same subject in the [[Borghese Gallery]] in [[Rome]].

Caravaggio arrived in Malta on 12 July 1607. He had spent the previous months in [[Naples]], where he had sought refuge with his powerful protectors the Colonna family after killing a man in a brawl in Rome the previous year. In Naples he had been an instant success, achieving ten commissions, including a number or large and very prestigious altarpieces, in less than a year, and inspiring a following of [[Caravaggisti]] among the city's artists. In short, in Naples he had found professional success, the esteem of fellow-artists, and the support of important patrons. Why then leave all this for a speck of rock inhabited by warrior-monks noted more for their fighting ([[Peter Robb (author)|Peter Robb]] compares them to the French Foreign Legion) than for their support of the arts? The following summarises the speculation of recent biographers such as Robb and Helen Langdon: In 1607 Caravaggio was still an outlaw, at risk of being tracked down by his enemies - the family of the man he had killed - and Naples, close to Rome, may have seemed comparatively exposed. His patrons and protectors - the Colonna, the Giustiniani, the banker Ottavio Costa,  - had strong links with Malta and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights]], and it may have been felt that joining the Order would give Carvaggio immediate protection and aid in procuring a Papal pardon for his eventual return to Rome. The Grand Master of the Knights, [[Alof de Wignacourt]], was keen to enhance the prestige of his Order and his capital, and the prospect of having one of the leading artists in Rome and Naples as ''de facto'' court painter must have been an appealing one. And so Caravaggio went to Malta.

The coat of arms in the bottom right corner of the painting is that of Ippolito Malaspina, Prior of the Order of the Knights of Saint John (the Knights of Malta) in Naples. Malaspina was a relative by marriage of Caravaggio's patron Ottavio Costa, a friend of his other patrons the Giustiniani brothers, and a cousin of Giovanni Andrea Doria, Prince of Genoa, who two years before had sheltered the artist after an earlier flight from Rome. It's possible that he may have had himself represented as the saint. ''[[Saint Jerome]]'' was thus a very important painting for the artist.

The subject seems oddly unmartial for a commission by a man whose ''raison d'etre'' was to fight the Turks - [[Jerome|St Jerome]] was venerated as the translator of the Bible, which he is seen doing here. But Malaspina was not only a famous warrior, he was also a commissioner for the poor, orphans and widows, and the painting may have been intended to emphasise both this aspect of his work and also the asceticism of the Order.

Ippolito Malaspina arrived in Malta at the end of the Great Siege of 1565. He landed with the 'Grande Soccorso' and was present in the final onslought on the invading Ottoman forces. Therefore, this knight indeed witnessed the final stages of the Great Siege. He was also a relative, if not the brother or cousin, of Vespasianus Malaspina who died a martyr's death whilst courageously fighting the Ottoman soldiery in Fort Saint Elmo. A depiction of Vespasianus Malaspina is found within the Co-Cathedral of Saint John on the right hand side of a window just above the chapel dedicated to the Langue of Italy. Therefore, Ippolito must have reached the Island to aid his brethren however his relative, amongst others, died a Catholic martyrs death. Previously to his Maltese residence, Ippolito Malaspina was Admiral of the Papal Fleet. The Catholic martyrs are unfortunately not much remembered by the Maltese, however a collective remembrace day referred to as [[Victory Day (Malta)|Victory Day]] is celebrated on September 8, Feast dedicated to the Nativity of Our Lady, also known as Our Lady of Victory on the Islands.

[[File:Contantinople Christian sarcophagus circa 400.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Constantinople]] Christian sarcophagus with [[XI monogram]], c. 400]]

A '''sarcophagus''' (plural '''sarcophagi''') is a box-like funeral receptacle for a [[cadaver|corpse]], most commonly carved in stone, and usually displayed above ground, though it may also be buried. The word "sarcophagus" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[Wiktionary:σάρξ|σάρξ]] ''sarx'' meaning "flesh", and [[Wiktionary:φαγεῖν|φαγεῖν]] ''phagein'' meaning "to eat", hence ''sarcophagus'' means "flesh-eating"; from the phrase ''lithos sarkophagos'' ([[Wiktionary:λίθος|λίθος]] [[Wiktionary:σαρκοφάγος|σαρκοφάγος]]). Since ''lithos'' is Greek for "stone", ''lithos sarcophagos'' means "flesh-eating stone". The word also came to refer to a particular kind of [[limestone]] that was thought to rapidly facilitate the decomposition of the flesh of corpses contained within it due to the chemical properties of the limestone itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordinfo.info/words/index/info/view_unit/520/?letter=C&amp;spage=19 WordInfo etymology.] As a noun the Greek term was further adopted to mean "[[coffin]]" and was carried over into [[LATIN]], where it was used in the phrase ''lapis sarcophagus'', "flesh-eating stone", referring to those same properties of limestone.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;[http://www.mcah.columbia.edu/medmil/pages/non-mma-pages/text_links/burialpractices.html Columbia University Department of Archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Worms sarcophagi.jpg|right|thumb|Roman-era sarcophagi at [[Worms, Germany]]]]

Sarcophagi were most often designed to remain above ground. In Ancient Egypt, a sarcophagus acted like an outer shell.

The [[Hagia Triada sarcophagus]] is a stone sarcophagus elaborately painted in [[fresco]]; one style of later Ancient Greek sarcophagus in painted pottery is seen in [[Klazomenian sarcophagi]], produced around the Ionian Greek city of [[Klazomenai]], where most examples were found, between 550 BC (Late Archaic) and 470 BC. They are made of coarse clay in shades of brown to pink. Added to the basin-like main sarcophagus is a broad, rectangular frame, often covered with a white slip and then painted. The huge [[Lycia]]n [[Tomb of Payava]], now in the [[British Museum]], is a royal tomb monument of about 360 BC designed for an open-air placing, a grand example of a common Lycian style.

[[Ancient Roman sarcophagi]]—sometimes metal or plaster as well as [[limestone]]—were popular from about the reign of [[Trajan]],&lt;ref&gt;Presbrey - Leland, ‘’Commemoration: The Book of Presbrey - Leland Memorials’’, Presbrey-Leland Incorporated, 1952 p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; and often elaborately carved, until the early [[Christian burial]] preference for interment underground, often in a limestone [[sepulchre]], led to their falling out of favor.&lt;ref name="columbia"/&gt; However, there are many important [[Early Christian sarcophagi]] from the 3rd to 4th centuries.
[[File:Roman - Sarcophagus with the Triumph of Dionysus - Walters 2331.jpg|left|thumb|The limestone relief on this [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sarcophagus, c.&amp;nbsp;AD 190, depicts the ''Triumph of [[Dionysus]]''. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]], Maryland.]]
Most Roman examples were designed to be placed against a wall and are decorated on three of the sides only. Sarcophagi continued to be used in Christian Europe for important figures, especially rulers and leading church figures, and by the [[High Middle Ages]] often had a recumbent [[tomb effigy]] lying on the lid. More plain sarcophagi were placed in crypts, of which the most famous examples include the [[Habsburg]] [[Imperial Crypt]] in [[Vienna]], Austria. The term tends to be less often used to describe Medieval, Renaissance, and later examples.

In the [[early modern period]], lack of space tended to make sarcophagi impractical in churches, but chest tombs or false sarcophagi, empty and usually bottomless cases placed over an underground burial, became popular in outside locations such as cemeteries and churchyards, especially in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries, where memorials were mostly not highly decorated and the extra cost of a false sarcophagus over a headstone acted as an indication of social status.

Sarcophagi, usually "false", made a return to the cemeteries of America during the last quarter of the 19th century, at which time, according to a New York company which built sarcophagi, "it was decidedly the most prevalent of all memorials in our cemeteries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Veit|first=Richard Francis|title=New Jersey Cemeteries and Tombstones: History in the Landscape|year=2008|publisher=Rutgers University Press/Rivergate Books|isbn=978-0813542362|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; They continued to be popular into the 1950s, at which time the popularity of flat memorials (making for easier grounds maintenance) made them obsolete. Nonetheless, a 1952 catalog from the memorial industry still included 8 pages of them, broken down into [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Classical architecture|Classical]] detail, a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] adaptation, and a [[Modern architecture|Modern]] variant.&lt;ref&gt;Presbrey - Leland, ‘’Commemoration: The Book of Presbrey - Leland Memorials’’, Presbrey-Leland Incorporated, 1952 pp. 79–85&lt;/ref&gt; Shown on the right are sarcophagi from the late 19th century located in [[Laurel Hill Cemetery]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The one in the back, the Warner Monument created by [[Alexander Milne Calder]] (1879), features the spirit or soul of the deceased being released.

==Asia==
In the [[Mekong Delta]] in southwestern [[Vietnam]], it is common for families to inter their members in sarcophagi near their homes, thus allowing ready access for visits as a part of the indigenous tradition of [[Veneration of the dead#Vietnam|ancestor worship]].

In [[Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]], [[waruga]] are a traditional form of sarcophagus.

In the [[textile arts]], a '''stitch''' is a single turn or loop of [[yarn|thread, or yarn]].  Stitches are the fundamental elements of [[sewing]], [[knitting]], [[embroidery]], [[crochet]], and [[needle lace]]-making, whether by hand or machine.&lt;ref name="Picken"&gt;Picken (1957), p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of stitches, each with one or more names, are used for specific purposes.

==Sewing, embroidery, and lace==
{{main|List of sewing stitches|embroidery stitch}}

All stitches:
* [[Backstitch]]
* [[Overcast stitch]]
* [[cross stitches|Cross stitch]]
* [[Buttonhole stitch|Buttonhole or blanket stitch]]
* [[Chain stitch]]
* [[Knotted stitch|Knot stitch]]

These stitches and their variations are named according to the position of the needle and direction of sewing (''running stitch'', ''backstitch''), the form or shape of the stitch (''chain stitch'', ''[[feather stitch]]'') or the purpose of the stitch ([[tack (sewing)|tailor's tack]], ''hem stitch'').&lt;ref name="RD stitch"&gt;Readers Digest (1976), pp. 122–143&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sewing machine]] stitches are classified by their structure: 
*Chain stitch, made with one thread
*[[Lockstitch]], made with two threads
*[[Overlock]], made with one to five threads
*Coverstitch, made with two or four threads (a twine)

Fancy machine stitches mimic traditional hand stitches using variations on the basic stitches.&lt;ref name="RD stitch" /&gt;

==Knitting==
{{main|Knitting|List of knitting stitches}}
In knitting, a stitch is a single loop of yarn, secured to the loops beside it to form a row or ''course'' of stitches and to the loops above and below it to form a ''wale''.

In securing the previous stitch in a wale, the next stitch can pass through the previous loop either from below or above. If the former, the stitch is denoted as a knit stitch or a plain stitch; if the latter, as a purl stitch. The two stitches are related in that a knit stitch seen from one side of the fabric appears as a purl stitch on the other side.

==Crochet==
{{main|List of crochet stitches}}
In [[crochet]], stitches are made by pulling a loop of thread through the work with a [[crochet hook]].  Crochet stitches are named based on their structure. In the English-speaking crochet world, basic stitches have different names that vary by country. The differences are usually referred to as UK/US or British/American.

'''''The Ferns of Great Britain and Ireland''''' was a book published in 1855 that featured 51 plates of [[nature printing]] by [[Henry Bradbury]].

==Description==
The text was a scientific description of all the varieties of [[Fern]]s found in the [[British Isles]]. The author of this work was the botanist [[Thomas Moore (botanist)|Thomas Moore]], the editor was [[John Lindley]].

The book was released at a time of so-called "[[pteridomania]]" in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal   | first = Peter D. A.    | last = Boyd   | authorlink =    | title = Pteridomania - the Victorian passion for ferns   | version = Revised: web version   | publisher = Antique Collecting 28, 6, 9-12.   | date = 2002-01-02   | url = http://www.peterboyd.com/pteridomania.htm   | id =    | accessdate =  2007-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with William Grosart Johnstone and Alexander Croall's ''Nature-Printed British Sea-Weeds'' (London, 1859-1860), the book featured Bradbury's innovative nature printing process. The publisher of the work was Bradbury and Evans.  Bradbury patented the process after seeing the invention of [[Alois Auer]] - though the identity of its inventor grew to be a subject of debate.

The technique was briefly in vogue, but did not persist in printing.  Bradbury, along with Auer, believed the technique to be an enormous advance in printing. However, the plants and other subjects that could be successfully printed in this way were few.  Ferns were one of the few plants with a form that could be replicated, the shape of the fronds being largely two-dimensional.

In this work the ferns, a plant highly suited to the process, were impressed upon soft lead plates. These were electroplated to become the printing plate, the details of the fronds and stem were hand-coloured at this stage. The resulting image was in two colours and provided a highly detailed and realistic depiction of the species.

'''''The Lute Player''''' is a composition by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] master [[Caravaggio]]. It exists in two versions, one in the Wildenstein Collection and another in the [[Hermitage Museum]], [[St. Petersburg]]. A third from [[Badminton House]], Gloucestershire, came to light in 2007 however some question its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3894605.stm|title='Caravaggio' painting sparks row|date=2004-07-14|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Caravaggio's early biographer [[Giovanni Baglione]] gives the following description of a piece done by the artist for his patron [[Cardinal Francesco Del Monte]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;E dipinse [per il Cardinale Del Monte]… anche un giovane, che sonava il Lauto, che vivo, e vero il tutto parea con una caraffa di fiori piena d’acqua, che dentro il reflesso d’ua fenestra eccelentemente si scorgeva con altri ripercotimenti di quella camera dentro l’acqua, e sopra quei fiori eravi una viva rugiada con ogni esquisita diligenza finta. E questo (disse) che fu il piu bel pezzo, che facesse mai. ("He also painted [for Cardinal Del Monte] a young man, playing the Lute, who seemed altogether alive and real with a carafe of flowers full of water, in which you could see perfectly the reflection of a window and other reflections of that room inside the water, and on those flowers there was a lively dew depicted with every exquisite care. And this (he said) was the best piece that he ever painted.)" &lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Baglione, ''Le Vite de’ Pittori, scultori et archtietti'', Roma, 1642, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The painting exists in three versions. All show a boy with soft facial features and thick brown hair, accompanying himself on the [[lute]] as he sings a [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]] about love. As in the Uffizi ''[[Bacchus (Caravaggio)|Bacchus]]'', the artist places a table-top in front of the figure. In the Hermitage and Badminton House versions it is bare marble, with a violin on one side and a still life of flowers and fruit on the other. In the Wildenstein version the table is covered with a carpet and extended forwards to hold a [[tenor recorder]], while the still life is replaced by a [[Virginals|spinetta]] (a small keyboard instrument) and a caged songbird. The musical instruments are valuable and probably came from Del Monte's personal collection.

[[Image:Luteplayer,Caravaggio,detail.jpg|left|thumb|''The Lute Player'' (detail from the Hermitage version).]]

The Hermitage and Badminton House versions show [[Madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s by [[Jacques Arcadelt]] (1515–1568), and the visible text reads in part: "Vous savez que je vous aime et vous adore...Je fus vôtre." ("You know I love you and adore you...I was yours"). The Wildenstein version shows songs by a native Florentine ([[Francesco de Layolle]]) on a text by [[Petrarch]]: ''Laisse le voile'' ('Let go the veil') and ''Pourquoi ne vous donnez-vous pas?'' ('Why do you not give yourself?') by [[Jacquet de Berchem|Giachetto Berchem]] (Jacquet de Berchem). The flowers and damaged fruit, and the cracked body of the lute, suggest the theme of transience: love, like all things, is fleeting and mortal. The choice of [[Franco-Flemish school|Franco-Flemish]] composers over native Italians – only Layolle was a native Italian – no doubt reflects the cultural (and political) affiliations of the pro-French Del Monte-Giustiniani circle.

The still life elements are of an extremely high standard in all versions, the finely rendered fruit and flowers in two versions equalled by the textures of spinetta and flute in the other, and the artist has reproduced the initial notes of the madrigals so exactly that one can recognize the Roman printer, Valerio Dorica.

The rather androgynous model could be Pedro Montoya, a [[castrato]] known to have been a member of the Del Monte household and a singer at the [[Sistine Chapel]] at about this time - castrati were highly prized and the Cardinal was a patron of music as well as of painting. More recently Caravaggio biographer [[Peter Robb (author)|Peter Robb]] has identified him as Caravaggio's companion [[Mario Minniti]], the model for several other paintings from this period including ''[[The Cardsharps (Caravaggio)|The Cardsharps]]'' and one of the two versions of ''[[The Fortune Teller (Caravaggio)|The Fortune Teller]]''.

All three versions demonstrate the innovative approach to light that Caravaggio adopted at this time. Caravaggio's method, as described by Caravaggio's contemporary [[Giulio Mancini]], was to use "a strong light from above with a single window and the walls painted black, so that having the lights bright and the shadows dark, it gives depth to the painting, but with a method that is not natural nor done or thought of by any other century or older painters like Raphael, Titian, Correggio and others." The room itself seems to be the same as that in the [[Contarelli Chapel]] ''[[The Calling of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|Calling of Saint Matthew]]'', and the beam of light across the rear wall has an upper limit that would appear to be the shutter of the window above the table in the Calling. The carafe is a "cut-and-paste" motif from another image, where the main light came from a window at more or less the same level as the carafe itself.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Martin Kemp (Nature, Nov. 2002, p. 364).&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a complex illustration of refracted light is unprecedented in the [[Cinquecento]], and may have been the result of collaboration with scientists in Del Monte’s circle, including [[Giovanni Battista della Porta]], who was the guiding spirit behind the foundation in 1603 of the Accademia dei Lincei. His multi-volume ''De Refractione Optices'' (1593) was particularly concerned with optical matters, the second volume being devoted entirely to the incidence of light on water-filled and glass spheres. The circle of Della Porta was significant for Caravaggio later on in Naples, where the commission for the ''Seven Acts of Mercy'' seems to have emanated from Giovanni Batista Manso, Marchese di Villa, whose friend, the alchemist Colantonio Stigliola, was a member of the Accademia dei Lincei.

The appearance of second originals is a feature of a new understanding of Caravaggio’s work, and indeed Vincenzo Giustiniani, whose experience was closely related to the artist’s career, describes in his Discorso sulla pittura the painter’s development as beginning with copying others’ work -  ‘Proceeding further, he can also copy his own work, so that the replica may be as good, and even sometimes better, than the first’. The procedure for making a second version was, however, substantially different from the sometimes very arduous task of building a group from many separate observations of reality, of figures and objects; it is natural that the ‘second original’ is sometimes more fluent than the first. The anatomical anomalies in the Wildenstein and Badminton House paintings, like the slightly out of line eyes, or the hesitations in the profile of the hand, are resolved in the Hermitage picture. By contrast, the Hermitage version is more cursory in the drapery, less insistent in the detail, and it does not have the magnificent reflections in the carafe, which were specific to the alchemical context of the original. This is also the reason for the jealousy with which the group of pictures was regarded by Caravaggio’s patron Del Monte, and for the misunderstanding that the pursuit of natural philosophy incurred in the Rome of his day.

[[Image:Caravaggioapollodetail.jpg|left|thumb|Apollo ''Lute Player'' (detail of flowers covered in dew as described by Baglione in 1642)]]

The  Wildenstein version was sold by Del Monte's heirs to Cardinal [[Antonio Barberini]] in 1628, when it was described as "Un giovane che sona di clevo"  (without an attribution) and included with ''St Catherine'' and the ''Cardsharps'' (named specifically as by Caravaggio) and various other paintings. The painting is illuminated by a soft [[chiaroscuro]] inspired by the [[Brescia]] masters of the 16th century and characteristic of the early phase of Caravaggio's development. The catalogue to the 1990 exhibition held to mark the identification of the Wildenstein ''Lute Player'' - which was already known but thought to be a copy by another hand - commented on the markedly different lighting used for this version, claiming that it "marks a significant step toward the more dramatically lit, highly focused style of Caravaggio's maturity" - i.e., towards the heightened contrast between shadows and light ([[tenebrism]]) that would mark paintings such as ''[[The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew]]''. Nevertheless, critic Jason Kaufman felt that the rendition of the boy in the Wildenstein version was aesthetically inferior to the Hermitage, "...the face...hard and the expression less sweet than bovine...[t]he features...more sharply defined, the eyebrows severely geometrized, and the complexion pink, rather than fleshtone, " and David Van Edwards, noting apparent mistakes in the depiction of the lute in the Wildenstein version, the secondary light source and the inconsistent perspectives of table and sitter, concluded that the painting is not by Caravaggio.&lt;ref&gt;D. Van Edwards “A Caravaggio re-discovered?” ''Lute News'', n. 50, June 1999 pp. 5-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hermitage version is from the collection of the artist's other important patron of the period, Del Monte's friend and neighbour, Marchese Vincenzo [[Giustiniani]].
It was purchased in 1808 at the Paris auction by Russian Imperor Alexandre I through his personal art advicer Valily Rudanovsky. Purchasing was supported by Dominique Vivant Denon.

==Badminton House version==
The [[Badminton House]] painting came to light at auction in [[Sotheby's]], New York (January 25, 2001, lot 179); the painting was sold attributed to the circle of Caravaggio, possibly by Carlo Magnone. Clovis Whitfield, an art-dealer based in London, has questioned the attribution and suggested the Badminton House painting may actually be by Caravaggio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1466943/Picture-sold-for-75000-is-Caravaggio-worth-millions.html|title=Picture sold for £75,000 'is Caravaggio worth millions'|last=Correspondent|first=Will Bennett, Art Sales|date=2004-07-13|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally covered in a thick yellow varnish, it corresponds in all details with the description made by Baglione of the work he saw at Cardinal Del Monte’s palace. The flowers are scattered with dewdrops as Baglione remarks, and the carafe of water reflects the window and other features of the room.&lt;!-- Flowers scattered with dew-drops were a common subject for artists, who competed with one-another to show the virtuosity of their painting. --&gt; These elements, and the considerable number of ''pentimenti'' (incisions made in the paint with the brush-handle, a common working method seen also in Leonardo's [[Salvator Mundi (Leonardo)|Salvator-Mundi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Video: Salvator Mundi — The rediscovery of a masterpiece: Chronology, conservation, and authentication {{!}} Christie's’|url=http://www.christies.com/features/Salvator-Mundi-timeline-8644-3.aspx|language=en|accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;), set the Badminton House painting apart from the Hermitage version. It is slightly larger than the Hermitage work, whose original edge cuts the flowers on the left and the scroll of the violin, and painted with denser brushwork.&lt;!-- No citation.  --&gt;

This painting would seem to be the one described in the 1627 inventory of Del Monte’s collection. It was not the painting described in 1628 by the heirs as ‘Un giovane che sona di clevo’  (without an attribution) which was sold together with Caravaggio’s '[[St Catherine (Caravaggio)|St Catherine]]'' and the '[[Cardsharps (Caravaggio)|Cardsharps]]''  (named specifically as by Caravaggio) and various other paintings to Cardinal [[Antonio Barberini]], which has come down to us in the work in the [[Wildenstein]] collection, at present on loan to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;!-- No source. --&gt;

[[Image:Caravaggioapolloluteplayerdetail2.jpg|left|thumb|''Apollo Lute Player'' (detail)]]

The flowerpiece is of major importance for the still-life tradition, not only in Italy, but also in the Netherlands, and there is a certain link to earlier Flemish painting; for example, many of the Flemish flower painters, from [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan Brueghel]] to [[Ambrosius Bosschaert]] and Van der Ast, often waited to study separate specimens in various seasons of the year but include them all in a fictive assembly. The fruits in the Luteplayer, however, are not of the same season as the flowers, suggesting a similar cross-seasonal approach as Brueghel and Bosschaert.

The flowers correspond with those illustrated by [[Giovanni Battista della Porta]] in his Magia Naturale (Naples, 1589) as ones corresponding to vision, from the marigold that looks like the Sun, the yellow cornflower that looks like the eye, to another flower that resembles the eyebright that was since the Middle Ages an ingredient in eye remedies. This would go some way to explaining the nature of the choice of the flowers, which are dominated by the irises at the top, and Iris was not only the messenger of the gods, but in the optical frame stood for the rainbow and the spectrum of colours that the various flowers represent. Once again, Della Porta’s De refractione optices has an entire book devoted to ‘De Iride et colore’, an attempt to arrive at an understanding of the rainbow. But the naturalism of the flowers, including the seedpods of the iris and the shrivelled florets, shows that Caravaggio was observing these from actual specimens, and not improving on what Nature might have arrived at had circumstances been different. The tacit expression of the theory of segnatura, the correspondence of certain forms from the natural world with those in man, is something that links the thinking behind the painting with Paracelsian belief. Del Monte’s interest in this is manifest in the group of portraits that hung in his alchemical Casino, which are of the same seven luminaries who are illustrated in the titlepage of [[Oswald Croll|Oswald Croll’s]] ''Basilica Chymica'' (Frankfurt, 1609). We know that the Casino on the Pincio was the centre in Rome of the practice of iatrochymia or chemical medicine, although this kind of natural philosophy was increasing frowned on and may well have played a part in the damnation memoriae that Del Monte was subjected to. But Federico Cesi and his [[Accademia dei Lincei]] were also dedicated followers of what they perceived as Paracelsian disciplines.&lt;!-- No citations. --&gt;

It appears likely that the ''Lute Player'' was originally intended as a decoration for the [[Cabinet (architecture)|studiolo]] on the first floor of the Casino on the Pincio that Del Monte had acquired in 1596, and where Guercino would later paint his fresco of Aurora  for the Ludovisi. On the ground floor Del Monte did his alchemical work and chemistry; above, on the ceiling of the studiolo, Caravaggio painted the gods Neptune, Jupiter and Pluto, representing the Elements. ''Apollo'' would have struck the right chord in representing the harmony of the universe, in a place opposite the single window. Already the strength of his painting style was in painting classical subjects from life around him, like the Bacchus in the painting in the Uffizi, their features were sometimes disguised by their contemporary appearance. Since [[Giordano Bruno]] had written that it was appropriate to represent [[Apollo]], ever-youthful, playing the lute, as opposed to his more conventional lyre, this may have been Del Monte’s intention in this painting, and the rays of sunlight that are such a feature of the glass sphere have this meaning. Apollo is very much in place in a room devoted to the elements, as is implied in the ceiling painting, for the Stanza degli Elementi that Vasari did in Palazzo Vecchio has Apollo with the Chariot of the Sun in its middle, and Del Monte had this subject as the centrepiece of the ceiling in his new studiolo in Palazzo Avogadro, painted by [[Andrea Sacchi]]. Indeed, one of the most copied images in Giulio Romano’s decoration of the [[Palazzo del Te]] is the ceiling with that perhaps Caravaggio may have known from a drawing.&lt;!-- No citations. --&gt;

The studiolo had room also for another of Del Monte’s pictures, the Shepherd ''[[Corydon (character)|Corydon]]''. This work, now in the Capitoline Museum, has long been misconstrued as St. John the Baptist, but apart from the exhibitionist subject of the young boy, the ram (instead of a lamb) is a contradiction for that subject. Instead the work is an emblematic subject: the ram represents the first sign of the Zodiac, Aries, at the period of the spring equinox and the energy of that season. In the combination of themes, the harmony of the spheres is represented figuratively by Apollo the Luteplayer, where the spring equinox and the spring flowers are balanced by the fruits of autumn on the table - from the autumn equinox - under the sign of Libra, when the forces of nature are once again in equilibrium. It is easier to see the effeminate beauty of the shepherd as corresponding to Del Monte’s personal aesthetic taste, than as the work that [[Ciriaco Mattei]] commissioned shortly afterwards for his first-born son, named indeed Giovanni Battista, a painting that is to be sought in one of the many paintings of St John the Baptist that Caravaggio executed. There was such a picture, painted for the [[House of Mattei|Mattei family]] and later also bought by Cardinal Pio from the Del Monte collection, an oblong composition with St John playing with a lamb, and with a reed cross on his shoulder, that was eventually sold to Gavin Hamilton in 1777.&lt;!-- No citations. --&gt;

The idea of "correspondences" that informed so much of contemporary natural philosophy, means that the globe of the carafe with its reflections, like a crystal ball, would have been seen as a parallel with the celestial globe on the ceiling with the Elements above.  This feature, described in the painting of the Luteplayer that Baglione saw presumably in situ with Cardinal Del Monte, is absent from the Hermitage version. Elements of the composition of the ''Apollo Lute Player'' are repeated not only in the Hermitage work (with several counterpoint variations), but also in the glass carafe in the lower part of the two paintings ''A Boy bitten by a Lizard'', most especially in the version in the National Gallery, London. There the central rose and white jasmine is quite close to these elements in the present work, while in the Longhi Foundation  picture the rose is a white one. The lower daisy in the present work has been repositioned, and in fact a prominent pentiment exists 3&amp;nbsp;cm above, and that is the position it has in the Hermitage painting of the Luteplayer. It could well be that the original flowerpiece that we know Del Monte owned of Caravaggio’s, which he seems to have bought even before he met him, probably through the local picture dealer Maestro Valentino, could have been the continuing source of these variations. It was a painting described as a carafe of flowers, two palmi  high, which was bought at the 1628 sale of the Del Monte collection in a lot that included the Musicians, but it has not been heard of since. It is interesting that he would devote such care to a painting of flowers, as he did also to the Basket of Fruit in the Ambrosiana, and that he was not averse to doing this, as is illustrated by the fact that he introduced the carafe of water with the same reflections into the canvases of the ''A Boy bitten by a Lizard'', without regard to the position of the figure in front of the light sources.&lt;!-- No citations. --&gt;

Since the artist spent, according to Bellori, four or five years in Rome doing repetitious devotional images, and copies of portrait heads ‘un grosso l’uno’, it was natural for him to repeat his own inventions when he arrived at this sensational new technique of copying reality, from a virtual image, instead of other people’s compositions. The parabolic mirror, probably the same one that Della Porta had had constructed in Venice in 1580, which had produced some sensational effects and led to the development of the camera obscura, was probably no larger than an eye-glass, but it made it possible to make a mosaic of naturalistic images that was extremely compelling; the technique also explains the shallow focus of Caravaggio’s compositions.&lt;!-- No citations. --&gt;

'''Time translation symmetry''' or '''temporal translation symmetry''' ('''TTS''') is a [[mathematical transformation]] in [[physics]] that moves the times of events through a common interval. Time translation symmetry is the hypothesis that the [[laws of physics]] are unchanged, (i.e. invariant) under such a transformation. Time translation symmetry is a rigorous way to formulate the idea that the laws of physics are the same throughout history. Time translation symmetry is closely connected via the [[Noether theorem]], to [[conservation of energy]].&lt;ref name=Wilczek&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilczek|first1=Frank|title=A Beautiful Question: Finding Nature's Deep Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oh3ICAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=16 July 2015|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-1-84614-702-9|chapter=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mathematics, the set of all time translations on a given system form a [[Lie group]].

There are many symmetries in nature besides time translation, such as [[Translational symmetry|spatial translation]] or [[rotational symmetries]]. These symmetries can be broken and explain diverse phenomena such as [[crystals]], [[superconductivity]], and the [[Higgs mechanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richerme|first1=Phil|title=Viewpoint: How to Create a Time Crystal|url=http://physics.aps.org/articles/v10/5|website=physics.aps.org|publisher=APS Physics|archiveurl=https://archive.is/eXKGV|archivedate=2 Feb 2017|date=18 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was thought until very recently that time translation symmetry could not be broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Else|first1=Dominic V.|last2=Bauer|first2=Bela|last3=Nayak|first3=Chetan|title=Floquet Time Crystals|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=117|issue=9|year=2016|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.117.090402|arxiv=1603.08001v4|bibcode=2016PhRvL.117i0402E|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08001v4.pdf|pmid=27610834|page=090402}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time crystals]], a state of matter first observed in 2017, break time translation symmetry.&lt;ref name=Gibney/&gt;

===Newtonian mechanics===

To formally describe time translation symmetry we say the equations, or laws, that describe a system at times &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; t + \tau&lt;/math&gt; are the same for any value of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, considering Newton's equation:

: &lt;math&gt;m\ddot{x}=-\frac{dV}{dx}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

One finds for its solutions &lt;math&gt;x=x(t)&lt;/math&gt; the combination:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}(t)^2 + V(x(t))&lt;/math&gt;

does not depend on the variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Of course, this quantity describes the total energy whose conservation is due to the time translation invariance of the equation of motion. By studying the composition of symmetry transformations, e.g. of geometric objects, one reaches the conclusion that they form a group and, more specifically, a [[Lie algebra|Lie transformation group]] if one considers continuous, finite symmetry transformations. Different symmetries form different groups with different geometries. Time independent Hamiltonian systems form a group of time translations that is described by the non-compact, [[Abelian group|abelian]], [[Lie group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. TTS is therefore a dynamical or Hamiltonian dependent symmetry rather than a kinematical symmetry which would be the same for the entire set of Hamiltonians at issue. Other examples can be seen in the study of [[time evolution]] equations of classical and quantum physics.

Many [[differential equations]] describing time evolution equations are expressions of invariants associated to some [[Lie group]] and the theory of these groups provides a unifying viewpoint for the study of all special functions and all their properties. In fact, [[Sophus Lie]] invented the theory of Lie groups when studying the symmetries of differential equations. The integration of a (partial) differential equation by the method of separation of variables or by Lie algebraic methods is intimately connected with the existence of symmetries. For example, the exact solubility of the [[Schrodinger equation]] in quantum mechanics can be traced back to the underlying invariances. In the latter case, the investigation of symmetries allows for an interpretation of the [[Quantum degeneracy|degeneracies]], where different configurations to have the same energy, which generally occur in the energy spectrum of quantum systems. Continuous symmetries in physics are often formulated in terms of infinitesimal rather than finite transformations, i.e. one considers the [[Lie algebra]] rather than the Lie group of transformations

===Quantum mechanics===
{{main article|Operator (physics)|Translation operator (quantum mechanics)|Energy operator|Symmetry in quantum mechanics}}
The invariance of a Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt; of an isolated system under time translation implies its energy does not change with the passage of time. Conservation of energy implies, according to the Heisenberg equations of motion, that &lt;math&gt;[ \hat{H}, \hat{H} ]=0&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;[ e^{i\hat{H}t/\hbar}, \hat{H} ]=0&lt;/math&gt;

or:

:  &lt;math&gt;[ \hat{T}(t), \hat{H} ]=0&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\hat{T}(t)=e^{i\hat{H}t/\hbar}&lt;/math&gt; is the time translation operator which implies invariance of the Hamiltonian under the time translation operation and leads to the conservation of energy.

===Nonlinear systems===
In many nonlinear field theories like [[general relativity]] or [[Yang-Mills theory|Yang-Mills theories]], the basic field equations are highly nonlinear and exact solutions are only known for ‘sufficiently symmetric’ distributions of matter (e.g. rotationally or axially symmetric configurations). Time translation symmetry is guaranteed only in [[spacetimes]] where the [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] is static: that is, where there is a coordinate system in which the metric coefficients contain no time variable. Many [[general relativity]] systems are not static in any frame of reference so no conserved energy can be defined.

'''Touring theatre''' is independent [[theatre]] that travels—often internationally—being presented at a different location in each [[city]].

Touring theatre is produced by a [[theater company]], called the producing entity, often based in one location, and sold, as a show, by a booking agent to presenters. The presenters are responsible for arranging the venue, local crew, and any other considerations needed and specified in the [[rider (theater)|rider]]. The presenter pays a set amount of money to the producing entity, and the producing entity then pays the traveling crew by check or direct deposit. The show could be in for one performance on one day, or for a "sit" of a week or longer. Extended engagements can last six weeks or more.

The contract between the presenter and the producing entity often includes stipulations on ''[[force majeure]]'', labor actions, and schedule of compensations and when each payment is due. It can be split between a pre-[[performance fee]], and a fee paid on the day of the performance, once complete. The contract will often stipulate the venue, venue contact information, and technical contacts. Also, the contract may state a minimum stage size, in order to ensure that the production will occur as envisioned. As with any contract, negotiations are possible, and can mean modifications to the set, staging, or responsibilities to the Presenter.

Riders proscribe the needed support the touring company requires. They include, but are not limited to, local crew staffing, dressing room access, equipment to be provided by the presenter, minimum turn around time between shows, meals, lodging, parking, and [[loading dock]] requirements. The rider is a legal document that is part of the agreement with the presenter and is treated as part of the contract.

Provisions in the rider specify hotel rooms based on "room night", which is 1 person, per room, per night. A theatre company can stretch the use of these room nights by double occupancy, though [[Trade union|union]] and/or contractual agreements with the performers may prohibit this practice for some or all of the touring company.

[[File:Liebermann, Max - Zwei Reiter am Strand - Gurlitt.jpg|thumb|Version of the painting that was seized by the Nazis in 1938]]
'''''Two Riders on the Beach''''' ({{lang-de|Zwei Reiter am Strand|link=no}}) is the title of two similar paintings by [[Max Liebermann]]. Both were painted in 1901 while Liebermann was on vacation in [[Scheveningen]] on the North Sea. The paintings are considered masterpieces of German [[impressionism]], heavily influenced by the style of French impressionist painters [[Édouard Manet]] and [[Edgar Degas]].

One of the paintings in the 1930s belonged to the collection of Jewish factory owner and art collector David Friedmann in [[Wrocław]], then Breslau, Silesia. It was seized by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] authorities shortly after the anti-Jewish ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' pogrom in 1938 and became a part of the collection of [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]]. After World War II the painting was seized by Allied authorities along with other works from Gurlitt's collection, but was returned to Gurlitt when he convinced the authorities he was the rightful owner. It was contained in the [[2012 Munich artworks discovery]] and was returned to the heirs of Friedmann by German authorities. The painting was sold at [[Sotheby's]] in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/nazi-looted-painting-from-munich-fetches-1-55-million/ TimesofIsrael: Nazi-looted painting from Munich fetches 1.55 Million]&lt;/ref&gt;

The other painting was part of a private collection in New York City before it was sold at [[Sotheby's]] in 2009. The new owner was again a private collector. The paintings are very similar; one difference is that the one that was part of Friedmann's collection shows both forelegs of the second horse.
