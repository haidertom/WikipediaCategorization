      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7630">'''Advance Steel''' is a [[computer-aided design|CAD]] software application for [[3D modeling]] and detailing of steel structures and automatic creation of fabrication drawings, [[bill of materials]] and [[Numerical control|NC]] files, was developed by [[GRAITEC]], but is now an [[Autodesk]] product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.autodesk.com/press-release/corporate-sustainability/autodesk-signs-agreement-acquire-structural-fabrication-and-d|title=Autodesk Signs Agreement to Acquire Structural Fabrication and Detailing Technology from Graitec|access-date=2013-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222090251/http://news.autodesk.com/press-release/corporate-sustainability/autodesk-signs-agreement-acquire-structural-fabrication-and-d|archive-date=2015-12-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software run on [[AutoCAD]].

== Features ==
The application supports all basic AutoCAD concepts and functions (snap points, grip points, copy, etc.). When running on its own CAD platform, the application provides the same capabilities as running on AutoCAD. Advance Steel CAD platform serves both as a graphic engine and an object oriented database. Compliancy is assured between versions of Advance Steel running on its own CAD platform and running on AutoCAD.

The Advance Steel information is stored in [[.dwg|DWG]] format.

The application includes [[AutoLISP|AutoLisp]] (enhancing standard AutoLisp to include Advance Steel commands) and COM ([[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]], C++) programming interfaces. This means that users can create their own customized macros for specialist requirements.

Advance Steel imports and exports to the following file formats:
* GTC;
* DWG;
* IFC. 2x3;
* CIS/2;
* SDNF; 
* PSS;
* KISS (“Keep it Simple, Steel”)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fabtrol.com/index.php/about-the-kiss-standard|title=About KISS standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* DSTV;
* DXF
[[File:AS-Stair-model-detail.png|upright=2|thumb|Detail views of a stair created using Advance Steel.]]
The main functions of Advance Steel concern:
* Creation of 3D model using a library of construction elements (i.e., beams, plates, bolts, welds, etc.).
* Sheet metal and plate work 
* Advanced tools for element collision detection.
* Clear workshop drawings, automatically labeled and dimensioned. 
* Checking the model in order to insure a correctly built 3D model and accurate bills of materials. 
* Automatic creation of general arrangement and shop drawings, fabrication drawings, fitting drawings, isometric views and fabrication drawings.
* Drawing creation workflow management (revision control, automatic update, etc.)
* Automatic creation of lists / bills of materials and NC files.
* Multi-User Technology - all users involved in a project can work simultaneously and securely on the same model, without errors.

Advance Steel provides instruments for modeling complex structures such as straight and spiral stairs, railings, ladders, etc. The program creates all necessary documents (including NC files) for the stair fabrication.

===Specific features===
[[File:AS-Joints-example.gif|right|thumb|Structure with connections, modeled in Advance Steel.]]
'''Parametric steel connections'''

Advance Steel has a library of more than 300 preset parametric steel connections to connect Advance elements grouped in the following categories: beam end to end joints, base plate joints, general bracing joints, cantilever beam to column joints, plate joints, clip angle joints, pylon joints, tube brace joints, purlin joints, stiffener joints, turnbuckle bracings, etc.

The user creates all connecting elements by a single operation. At the same time, the connected elements are processed (shortened, coped, etc.). The software allows users to customize the connections:
* Set the parameters of the joint;
* Process the connected elements;
* Transfer the properties from one steel connection to another;
* Update the steel connection;

'''Joint Design engine'''

The software dimensions and checks joints according to [[Eurocode]]s 3 standards and AISC North American standards. A design report can be created.

'''Drawing styles'''

Based on a 3D-model, dimensioned and labeled 2D general arrangement and shop drawings can be automatically created using drawing styles. The drawings are created in separate DWG files; however they are linked to track changes. Thus, the drawings can be updated after any model modifications and the drawing revision can be managed.

The software has a variety of predefined drawing styles for the creation of general arrangement drawings and shop drawings for single parts and assemblies. A drawing style is a set of rules used to create a detail drawing and defines the elements that are displayed including labeling and dimensioning preferences.

Drawing styles provide the option to automatically create drawings and to modify the layout exactly to user requirements. Drawing styles are used in a similar way to AutoCAD dimension styles, line styles, etc. The predefined drawing styles are different for each installation and country. Custom drawing styles can also be defined.

== Software compatibility ==

The application is compatible with: 
* [[Windows 10]], [[Windows 8]], [[Windows 7]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows XP]] Pro (32-bit and 64-bit);
* AutoCAD 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017
* AutoCAD Architecture 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017

== Software interoperability ==

Advance Steel integrates GRAITEC's data synchronization technology, "GTC" (GRAITEC Transfer Center). This technology offers:
* Import/Export data in standard formats: CIS/2,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coa.gatech.edu/~aisc/index.php?cat1=1 |title=About CIS/2 standard |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703082143/http://www.coa.gatech.edu/~aisc/index.php?cat1=1 |archivedate=2008-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SDNF, PSS, IFC 2.x3.
* Multiple Advance Steel users that work simultaneously on the same project and synchronize their models.
* Synchronization in Advance Steel of modifications made by engineers in other GRAITEC software (section changes, addition of structural elements, etc.).

GTC is Graitec’s solution for CAD / Design software interoperability and integration specialized in creating and handling a BIM ([[Building Information Modeling|Building Information Model]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7111">In [[electrical engineering]], the '''alpha-beta''' (&lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt;) '''transformation'''  (also known as the '''Clarke transformation''') is a mathematical [[Transform (mathematics)|transformation]] employed to simplify the analysis of [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase circuits]]. Conceptually it is similar to the [[dq0 transformation]]. One very useful application of the &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transformation is the generation of the reference signal used for space vector modulation control of three-phase [[Inverter (electrical)|inverters]].

==Definition==

The &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transform applied to three-phase currents, as used by [[Edith Clarke]], is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=W. C. Duesterhoeft |author2=Max W. Schulz |author3=Edith Clarke | journal=Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers| title=Determination of Instantaneous Currents and Voltages by Means of Alpha, Beta, and Zero Components|date=July 1951|volume=70|issue=2|
pages=1248–1255|ISSN=0096-3860|doi=10.1109/T-AIEE.1951.5060554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;i_{\alpha\beta\gamma}(t) = Ti_{abc}(t) = \frac{2}{3}\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{1}{2} \\ 
0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 
\frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{2} \\ 
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}i_a(t)\\i_b(t)\\i_c(t)\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;i_{abc}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a generic three-phase current sequence and &lt;math&gt;i_{\alpha\beta\gamma}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding current sequence given by the transformation &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.
The inverse transform is:

:&lt;math&gt;i_{abc}(t) = T^{-1}i_{\alpha\beta\gamma}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
-\frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; 1\\
-\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}i_\alpha(t)\\i_\beta(t)\\i_\gamma(t)\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The above Clarke's transformation preserves the amplitude of the electrical variables which it is applied to. Indeed, consider a three-phase symmetric, direct, current sequence
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
i_a(t)=&amp;\sqrt{2}I\cos\theta(t),\\
i_b(t)=&amp;\sqrt{2}I\cos\left(\theta(t)-\frac23\pi\right),\\
i_c(t)=&amp;\sqrt{2}I\cos\left(\theta(t)+\frac23\pi\right),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Root mean square|RMS]] of &lt;math&gt;i_a(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i_b(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i_c(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the generic time-varying angle that can also be set to &lt;math&gt;\omega t&lt;/math&gt; without loss of generality. Then, by applying &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; to the current sequence, it results
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
i_{\alpha}=&amp;\sqrt2 I\cos\theta(t),\\
i_{\beta}=&amp;\sqrt2 I\sin\theta(t),\\
i_{\gamma}=&amp;0,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the last equation holds since we have considered balanced currents. As it is shown in the above, the amplitudes of the currents in the &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; reference frame are the same of that in the natural reference frame.

=== Power invariant transformation ===
The active and reactive powers computed in the Clark's domain with the transformation shown above are not the same of those computed in the standard reference frame. This happens because &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is not [[unitary matrix|unitary]]. In order to preserve the active and reactive powers one has, instead, to consider
:&lt;math&gt;i_{\alpha\beta\gamma}(t) = Ti_{abc}(t) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{1}{2} \\ 
0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt2} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt2} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt2} \\ 
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}i_a(t)\\i_b(t)\\i_c(t)\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
which is a unitary matrix and the inverse coincides with its transpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Area Based Approach for Three Phase Power Quality Assessment in Clarke Plane|author1=S. CHATTOPADHYAY|author2=M. MITRA|author3=S. SENGUPTA|journal=Journal of Electrical Systems|year=2008|volume=04|issue=01|pages=62|url=http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=fulltext&amp;passMe=http://journal.esrgroups.org/jes/papers/4_1_5.pdf|accessdate=2012-04-26}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this case the amplitudes of the transformed currents are not the same of those in the standard reference frame, that is
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
i_{\alpha}=&amp;\sqrt3 I\cos\theta(t),\\
i_{\beta}=&amp;\sqrt3 I\sin\theta(t),\\
i_{\gamma}=&amp;0.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Finally, the inverse transformation in this case is
:&lt;math&gt;
i_{abc}(t) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
-\frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
-\frac{1}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}i_\alpha(t)\\i_\beta(t)\\i_\gamma(t)\end{bmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Simplified transformation ===
Since in a balanced system &lt;math&gt;i_a(t)+i_b(t)+i_c(t)=0&lt;/math&gt; and thus &lt;math&gt;i_\gamma(t)=0&lt;/math&gt; one can also consider the simplified transform&lt;ref name="Tahri"&gt;F. Tahri, A.Tahri, Eid A. AlRadadi and A. Draou Senior,  "Analysis and Control of Advanced Static VAR compensator Based on the Theory of the Instantaneous Reactive Power," presented at ACEMP, Bodrum, Turkey, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;i_{\alpha\beta}(t) = \frac23 \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; -\frac12 &amp; -\frac12\\ 
0 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}i_a(t)\\i_b(t)\\i_c(t)\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which is simply the original Clarke's transformation with the 3rd equation thrown away, and

:&lt;math&gt;i_{abc}(t) = \frac32\begin{bmatrix} \frac23 &amp; 0 \\
-\frac{1}{3} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \\
-\frac{1}{3} &amp; -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}i_\alpha(t)\\i_\beta(t)\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Geometric Interpretation==

The &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transformation can be thought of as the projection of the three phase quantities (voltages or currents) onto two stationary axes, the alpha axis and the beta axis.

[[Image:AlphaBeta geometric interpretation.gif|center|frame|Shown above is the &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transform as applied to three symmetrical currents flowing through three windings separated by 120 physical degrees. The three phase currents lag their corresponding phase voltages by &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; axis is shown with the &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; axis aligned with phase 'A'. The current vector &lt;math&gt;I_{\alpha\beta\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; rotates with angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. There is no &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; component since the currents are balanced.]]

===&lt;math&gt;dq0&lt;/math&gt; transform===
{{Main|dq0 transformation}}

The [[dq0 transformation|&lt;math&gt;dq0&lt;/math&gt; transform]] is conceptually similar to the &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transform. Whereas the &lt;math&gt;dq0&lt;/math&gt; transform is the projection of the phase quantities onto a rotating two-axis reference frame, the &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta\gamma&lt;/math&gt; transform can be thought of as the projection of the phase quantities onto a stationary two-axis reference frame.

'''Alvéole''' is a French company based in Paris and founded in 2010 by Quattrocento&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usinenouvelle.com/article/quattrocento-leve-5-2-millions-d-euros-pour-developper-des-medtechs.N402482|title=Quattrocento lève 5,2 millions d'euros pour développer des medtechs.|last=Arnaud,|first=Dumas|date=July 16, 2016|work=L'USINE NOUVELLE|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a business accelerator company in the life science field, in collaboration with researchers from the [[French National Center for Scientific Research]] with expertise in [[bioengineering]] and cell imaging.

Alvéole is specialized in the development of devices for controlling microenvironment ''in vitro''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://labiotech.eu/micropatterning-cells/|title=Here’s a Flashy New Technique to Model Disease|last=|first=|date=October 26, 2017|work=Labiotech.eu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its first product is PRIMO: a contactless and maskless photopatterning device allowing researchers to control the [[topography]] (via [[microfabrication]]) and [[biochemistry]] (via [[micropatterning]]) of cell [[Microenvironment (biology)|microenvironment]].

== Products ==
Alvéole's first product is PRIMO, a photopatterning device which can be docked on standard [[Inverted microscope|inverted microscopes]]. PRIMO photopatterning technique is based on LIMAP technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strale|first=Pierre-Olivier|last2=Azioune|first2=Ammar|last3=Bugnicourt|first3=Ghislain|last4=Lecomte|first4=Yohan|last5=Chahid|first5=Makhlad|last6=Studer|first6=Vincent|date=2015-12-21|title=Multiprotein Printing by Light-Induced Molecular Adsorption|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.201504154|journal=Advanced Materials|language=en|volume=28|issue=10|pages=2024–2029|doi=10.1002/adma.201504154|issn=0935-9648}}&lt;/ref&gt; and combines a maskless and contactless [[photolithography]] system controlled by a dedicated software (Leonardo) and a specific photo-initiator (PLPP). This system modulate UV-light illumination through an array of micromirrors ([[Digital micromirror device|DMD]]). The UV light is then projected through the objective of the microscope onto the substrate in order to either perform microfabrication or protein micropatterning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pierre-Olivier Strale, Matthieu Opitz, Marie-Charlotte Manus, Grégoire Peyret, Aurélien Duboin, Louise Bonnemay, Josselin Ruaudel|first=|date=May 2018|title=Controlling the topography and biochemistry of cell culture substrates with PRIMO® photopatterning system|url=|journal=Nature Methods|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

- [[Microfabrication]]: The modulated UV light is projected on a photosensitive resist. The cured [[photoresist]] can then be used as a mold to deposit [[Polydimethylsiloxane|PDMS]] and generate microstructured PDMS chips.

- Protein [[micropatterning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nanoscalelabs.com/micropatterning.html|title=Micropatterning|last=|first=|date=2017|website=nanoscaleLABS|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;: The modulated UV light is projected onto a standard cell culture [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] previously coated with an anti-fouling polymer and reacts with the PLPP photo-initiator to locally degrade this coating. [[Adhesion protein]]s can then be adsorbed on the illuminated area only, allowing for the creation of proteins micropatterns on which cells can adhere.

== Applications ==
By [[micropatterning]] [[Adhesion protein|adhesions proteins]] with a sub-cellular resolution, PRIMO enables to control [[Cell adhesion|cell adhesio]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n and isolate single cells under highly reproducible conditions. This allows cell biology researchers from various fields – such as [[mechanobiology]], [[toxicology]], [[immunology]], [[oncology]] or [[neuroscience]]s – to control or study intracellular mechanisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delépine|first=Chloé|last2=Meziane|first2=Hamid|last3=Nectoux|first3=Juliette|last4=Opitz|first4=Matthieu|last5=Smith|first5=Amos B.|last6=Ballatore|first6=Carlo|last7=Saillour|first7=Yoann|last8=Bennaceur-Griscelli|first8=Annelise|last9=Chang|first9=Qiang|date=2015-11-24|title=Altered microtubule dynamics and vesicular transport in mouse and human MeCP2-deficient astrocytes|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddv464|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=146–157|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddv464|issn=0964-6906|pmc=4690499|pmid=26604147}}&lt;/ref&gt; or screen the effect of molecules on cell functions.

On a larger scale, PRIMO also makes it possible to control complex cellular arrangements, to study [[cell migration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/51002/title/Image-of-the-Day--Cell-Dance-/|title=Image of the Day: Cell Dance|last=|first=|date=November 24, 2017|work=The Scientist|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[axon guidance]].

Furthermore,the micropatterning process with PRIMO can be performed on microstructures' sides, top or bottom, making it possible to confine single cells or multicellular arrangements in three-dimension&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last=Stoecklin|first=Celine|last2=Yue|first2=Zhang|last3=Chen|first3=Wilhelm W.|last4=Mets|first4=Richard de|last5=Fong|first5=Eileen|last6=Studer|first6=Vincent|last7=Viasnoff|first7=Virgile|date=2018-03-28|title=A new approach to design artificial 3D micro-niches with combined chemical, topographical and rheological cues|biorxiv=291104}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''The Architects Act 1997''' (c. 22) is the consolidating [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] for the keeping and publishing of the statutory [[Register of Architects]] by the [[Architects Registration Board]]. It has the [[long title]]: ''An Act to consolidate the enactments relating to architects.'' It consolidated two Acts of the 1930s as later amended both by primary legislation and by Orders in Council implementing the EC directive on architects providing for the recognition of architects qualified in other EC states, and the changes which had been made by Part III&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/53/part/III/1996-10-01?timeline=true E+W+S+N.I. Architects]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo970120/text/70120-03.htm#70120-03_head0 Hansard]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passage of the consolidating Bill==
The Architects Act 1997 consolidated the originating and amending Acts relating to the registration of architects, namely the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects Acts]] 1931-1996 (section 125 of the [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]]).

The [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] was introduced to the [[House of Lords]] on 17 December 1996 by the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[James Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern|Lord Mackay of Clashfern]], and given its first reading.&lt;ref name="introduced"/&gt; It received its second reading without call for a debate on 20 January 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo970120/text/70120-03.htm#70120-03_head0|title=House of Lords Hansard; vol 577, part 39, col 384|date=20 January 1997|work=[[Hansard]]|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was passed to the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills. On 3 March 1997 it was read for a third time without debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo970303/text/70303-03.htm#70303-03_head3|title=House of Lords Hansard; vol 578, part 66, Col 1503|date=3 March 1997|work=[[Hansard]]|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passed to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/cgi-bin/newhtml_hl?DB=semukparl&amp;STEMMER=en&amp;WORDS=17%20mar%201997%20column%20696&amp;ALL=&amp;ANY=&amp;PHRASE=%2217%20Mar%201997%20:%20Column%20696%20%22&amp;CATEGORIES=&amp;SIMPLE=&amp;SPEAKER=&amp;COLOUR=red&amp;STYLE=s&amp;ANCHOR=70317-26_spnew0&amp;URL=/pa/cm199697/cmhansrd/vo970317/debtext/70317-26.htm#70317-26_spnew0|title=House of Commons Hansard; 17 March 1997 part 26, Col 695|date=17 March 1997|work=[[Hansard]]|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill was given [[Royal Assent]] on 19 March 1997 and came into force on 21 July 1997.

==Legislative continuity==
The legislative continuity from the originating Act of 1931 to the consolidating Act of 1997 is shown by paragraph 19(2)(a) of Schedule 2 in the 1997 Act:
: ''"the Council" means the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom established under the 1931 Act, which was renamed as the Board by section 118(1) of the 1996 Act.''
The [[Architects Registration Board]] (ARB) has limited powers to make rules in the manner prescribed by the Architects Act 1997, but not the power to make regulations which had previously been ascribed to the registration body when it was constituted as the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK).

==Statutory purpose==
The Act embodied previous legislation consequent upon [[Directive (European Union)|EU directives]] concerning the mutual recognition of professional qualifications in the [[member states of the European Union]] and other [[European Economic Area|EEA]] States, and certain changes which had been made to the previous legislation after the publication of the [[Warne Report]] in 1993.

For the purpose of ascertaining the duties and functions which the Architects Registration Board is required to execute and perform under the Architects Act 1997, the constraints on the Board include the requirements judicially applicable in the name of [[administrative law]].

In May 2006 ministerial responsibility for the ARB was transferred from the ODPM to the DCLG ([[Department for Communities and Local Government]]).  The DCLG website shows that of "four categories" of "[[non-departmental public bodies]]" (NDPBs) the ARB was being classified (at the end of May 2007) as one of two "[[Statutory corporation|public corporations]]", the other one being the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;not to be confused with the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)]]&lt;/ref&gt; a body of entirely different political and legislative origin, function and capacities, so that the two have practically nothing in common. The website there briefly described the ARB as:
: ''The independent statutory regulator of all UK registered architects which has a dual mandate to protect the consumer and to safeguard the reputation of architects''.
That appears to have been more a politically advised than a factual statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/22|title=Architects Act|year=1997|work=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-12-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071116155827/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1997/1997022.htm| archivedate=November 16, 2007&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that it lacks congruity with an ordinary or accurate reading of the legislation enacted by Parliament (see further information below "Accuracy of Government Information").

===Amendment in 2008 under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)]]===
[[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|Amendments]] made in June 2008 by [[Statutory Instrument]] established rules for the recognition of professional qualifications enabling migrants from the [[European Economic Area]] or [[Switzerland]] to register as architects in the United Kingdom. It also set out provisions for facilitating temporary and occasional professional services cross-border.

==Changes: before and after July 1997==
The previous legislation had enabled and required the [[Register of Architects]] to be established, maintained and published; and for that purpose there had been a Council, called the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK), which had been established as a body corporate by the originating Act, namely the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]].

The changes embodied in the [[consolidating Act]] of 1997 had first been enacted in Part III of the [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]].  The changes had been made on the basis of a government consultation document dated 19 July 1994 which the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]] had issued with the title "[[Reform of Architects Registration]]".  The consultation document had set out fourteen proposals for reform, stemming from a request from ARCUK to the Government in 1992 that the Architects Registration Acts should be reviewed; and stated that a report on the review which had been carried out had been published by HMSO in 1993.  The report had been made by Mr E J D Warne, CB, and is commonly known as "The [[Warne Report]]".

The legislation which followed carried the proposed purposes into effect only in part.  In the consultation document the purpose of the reformed body was stated to be: setting criteria for admission to the Register; preventing misuse of the title "[[architect]]"; and the discipline of unprofessional conduct, and the setting of fee levels.  To that end, fourteen proposals had been enumerated.  Some were later abandoned; and others substantially altered, whether in the Bill which was presented to Parliament or in its passage through Parliament, including:
* that the reformed Board would be given statutory authority to make regulations consistent with the provisions of the legislation governing architects registration;
* that the reformed Board would publicise a statement of the criteria for disciplinary offences; and
* that in disciplinary cases, there would be a range of non-monetary penalties, and hearings would be before a small statutory committee composed of both architects and non-architects, with a right to appeal to the full Board.

Proposals mentioned in the consultation document which were later enacted and are now operative were:
* that ARCUK would remain as a legal entity, but, with no impact on its role or status, the name would be changed to "[[Architects Registration Board]]" (ARB);
* that there should be an office of Registrar whose functions would be to maintain the Register and carry out the instructions of the Board;
* that the Board would be made up of 8 lay members appointed by the Government, and 7 architects elected by registered architects; and
* that the [[Board of Architectural Education]] would be abolished, by reason of it being an unwieldy body which would be unnecessary for fulfilling the functions of the reformed Registration Board.

The Table of Derivations, set out at the end of the Act after Schedule 3, by showing the changes which had been made by the 1996 Act to the originating Act of 1931 (as it had by then been amended by the 1938 Act and other legislation), distinguishes them from the provisions which were in the legislation before the 1996 Act, and so were operative in the time of ARCUK and have remained operative from 21 July 1997, when the reconstituting changes took effect.

===Professional Conduct Committee===
One of the changes made was replacing the Discipline Committee of ARCUK with a Professional Conduct Committee under Part III of the Act with statutory powers to inflict fines expressly on a par with criminal penalties. Under the Act, the committee was to be a body having persons who were not themselves members of the profession in the decisive majority and who would not necessarily have the appropriate skill and knowledge to be able to act competently and fairly in respect of hazarding an architect's professional reputation or livelihood; nor would members of the committee be acting under the judicial oath of a judge or a magistrate in a court of criminal or civil jurisdiction, or pursuant to the consensual jurisdiction of an arbitrator. As a safeguard of [[due process]] in accordance with the [[rule of law]] the statutory provisions for constituting the Professional Conduct Committee in Part II of Schedule 1 of the Act (and as later amended) reflect the usual practice for appointing a legally qualified chairman, with appropriate experience, who can be held to have a professional and judicial responsibility for protecting the basic right of any accused person, whose reputation and livelihood could be at stake, to a fair and unprejudiced hearing and trial.

'''Exoneration'''

Under the first section of Part III of the Act &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/22/part/III section 13]&lt;/ref&gt; 
the Board is required to issue a code "laying down standards of professional conduct and practice expected of registered persons",&lt;ref&gt;for current code see ARB website page Architects Code: Standards of Conduct and Practice 2010 Version [http://www.arb.org.uk/professional_standards/regulating_architects/architects_code_2010/code.php]&lt;/ref&gt; but the same section  states explicitly that failure to comply with the provisions of the code shall not be taken of itself to constitute unacceptable professional conduct. In the case of an architect against whom an allegation of unacceptable professional conduct or serious professional incompetence has not been sustained by the Professional Conduct Committee the Act provides for publication of an exonerating statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/22/part/III section 15 (5)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The Table of Derivations also shows that certain definitions which were inserted for the purpose of the consolidation included one to make clear that where there is a reference to "unacceptable professional conduct", it has the same meaning as it has in section 14 (not ''vice versa''): in section 14(1) the phrase is expanded as "conduct which falls short of the standard required of a registered person".

==Interpretation==

===Legislative context of Architects Registration===
Under the legislation, the registration body has been a statutory corporation from its inception, first as a Council of numerous persons nominated mainly by professional bodies under the 1931 Act, and, from July 1997, as a Board of fifteen persons, of which the majority has been appointed by the [[Privy Council]] in the manner prescribed by paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 1 of the Act, that is: 
: ''...after consultation with the Secretary of State and such other persons or bodies as the Privy Council thinks fit, to represent the interests of users of architectural services and the general public'',
Members of the general public clearly have an interest to the extent that the legislation makes it a criminal offence to infringe the restrictions placed upon the freedom of individuals (including qualified architects), and of firms and partnerships, and companies and corporations of all kinds, to use the word "architect".

From the 1880s, it has been a moot point whether the effect of such registration and protection of the title "architect" would be to place an undue burden on the profession for too little benefit for the public, or to confer an unfair advantage on the profession, or one section of it, as against competitors. But in more recent decades the statutory [[Register of Architects]] and the protection of the title "[[architect]]" under the legislation has been affected by the obligation of the Government to secure compliance with obligations in connection with membership of the [[European Union]] and the [[European Economic Area]]. This has brought in its train questions about the criteria and standards for deciding upon [[equivalence of professional qualifications]] in EU and EEA countries, and the legitimate expectations of those who have qualified.

===Accuracy of UK Government information about Architects Registration===
In May 2006 the then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair|(Mr Blair)]] arranged for ministerial responsibility for the Architects Registration Board to be transferred from the then [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] (ODPM) to a newly formed Department which was to be called "[[Department of Communities and Local Government|Communities and Local Government]]" (DCLG) and to be headed by a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] ([[Ruth Kelly]]), to whom the Prime Minister addressed [http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/388681/prime-minister-letter a letter] setting out what was required.  This Department's [http://www.communities.gov.uk/ official website] published the Prime Minister's letter and stated its vision to be of "prosperous and cohesive communities, offering a safe, healthy and sustainable environment for all".

The website also had [http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/buildingregulations/architects/architectsregistration/ a page] for describing the [[Architects Registration Board]] where it offered a summary of the effect of the legislation, but which had a thread of inaccuracy in three out of four sentences, namely:
* stating that ARB "succeeded" ARCUK, when the legislation had expressly stated that it was the same body but with another name as from July 1997 (See above: Continuity of Legislation);
* stating that it was established to guarantee the professional competence of architects to consumers, when there is nothing in the legislation or otherwise giving ARB either the legal powers or the funds to honour any such guarantee; and
* that all architects must be registered by ARB in order to practise legally in the United Kingdom, when under the legislation (see related articles cited below) an architect, or any other person, is free to perform or supply the services of an architect subject only to the restrictions on the use of the vernacular word "[[architect]]" contained in the legislation first enacted by Parliament in the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|1938 Act]].

The '''Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society''' was first established in 1974 to promote philosophical conferences, workshops, summer schools, and research that are inspired by the work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and the [[Vienna Circle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graz: Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society |url=http://philosophie-gewi.uni-graz.at/en/researching/philosophical-societies/oesterreichische-ludwig-wittgenstein-gesellschaft/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224042/http://philosophie-gewi.uni-graz.at/en/researching/philosophical-societies/oesterreichische-ludwig-wittgenstein-gesellschaft/ |archivedate=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ALWS&gt;{{cite web|title=Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society|url=http://www.alws.at}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an international society, which also has a publication series.&lt;ref name =ontos&gt;{{cite web|title=Publications of the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society|url=http://www.ontos-verlag.de/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=21&amp;Itemid=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1974, [[Elisabeth Leinfellner]], [[Werner Leinfellner]], Rudolf Haller, Paul Weingartner, and Adolf Hübner founded the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society (ALWS), but it was the impetus of the first [[International Wittgenstein Symposium]] in [[Kirchberg am Wechsel]], [[Lower Austria]] that led to its development as an international society. The location of the ALWS is in Kirchberg am Wechsel and the location was selected because Ludwig Wittgenstein taught at elementary schools close Kirchberg am Wechsel in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=ALWS/&gt;

==Goals==

The ALWS has two primary goals. 
*To promote the analysis, tradition, and dissemination of Wittgenstein’s philosophy.  
*To promote, more generally, philosophy that has its roots in Austria and other countries with emphasis on [[analytic philosophy]] inspired by Wittgenstein and [[philosophy of science]] inspired by, but not limited to, the philosophy of the Vienna Circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goals|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/alws/view/unsere_ziele/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==

They currently report 120 members both national and international.  Individuals can download an application form their website.  Membership is decided by the Executive Committee of the ALWS based on academic criteria.  Students pay half the fee.  Members receive a 30% discount on fees for the International Wittgenstein Symposium and for ALWS publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Membership|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/alws/view/mitgliedschaft/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Since the first International Wittgenstein Symposium, the ALWS has published its proceedings.  In 2006, they started a new series (published by ontos verlag). The new series contains:&lt;ref name=ontos/&gt; 
*The official proceedings of the International Wittgenstein Symposium
*Special workshops 
*High-quality publications submitted to and reviewed by the ALWS.

==International Ludwig Wittgenstein Institute (ILWI)==

The ILWI was recently founded by the ALWS and supports scientific and cultural projects that are related to Wittgenstein’s philosophy and the goals of the ALWS. The ILWI presents:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ILWI|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/ilwi/view/ilwi_general_information/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Workshops
*Summer schools
*Wittgenstein lectures
*Research opportunities at the ILWI

==Sponsorship==

The Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society is funded by the government of [[Lower Austria]], the Austrian Federal Ministry for Science and Research, Austrian National Bank, Raiffeisenbank NÖ-Süd Alpin, Kirchberg am Wechsel, membership fees, and donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sponsors|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/credit/view/sponsoren/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chaetognatha''', meaning ''bristle-jaws'', and commonly known as '''arrow worms''', is a phylum of predatory [[marine worm]]s that are a major component of [[plankton]] worldwide. About 20% of the known species are [[benthic zone|benthic]], and can attach to algae and rocks. They are found in all marine waters, from surface tropical waters and shallow tide pools to the deep sea and polar regions. Most chaetognaths are transparent and are torpedo shaped, but some deep-sea species are orange. They range in size from {{convert|2|to|120|mm|in|1}}.

There are more than 120 modern species assigned to over 20 genera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Register of Marine Species|url=http://www.marinespecies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the limited diversity of species, the number of individuals is large.&lt;ref name="Bone"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Bone |editor1-first=Q. |editor2-last=Kapp |editor2-first=H. |editor3-last=Pierrot-Bults |editor3-first=A. C. |year=1991 |title=The Biology of Chaetognaths |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |place=London |isbn=978-0-19-857715-7 |ref=Bone, Kapp &amp; Pierrot-Bults}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrow worms are usually considered a type of [[protostome]] that do not belong to either [[Ecdysozoa]] or [[Lophotrochozoa]].

==Anatomy==
[[File:MEB back.png|thumb|left|180px|The jaw organ of a Chaetognath of the genus ''[[Sagitta (genus)|Sagitta]]]]''
Chaetognaths are transparent or translucent dart-shaped animals covered by a [[cuticle]]. The body is divided into a distinct head, trunk, and tail. There are between four and fourteen hooked, grasping spines on each side of their head, flanking a hollow vestibule containing the mouth. The spines are used in hunting, and covered with a flexible hood arising from the neck region when the animal is swimming. All chaetognaths are [[carnivore|carnivorous]], preying on other planktonic animals.&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 1046–1050|isbn= 978-0-03-056747-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trunk bears one or two pairs of lateral fins incorporating structures superficially similar to the [[fin ray]]s of fish, with which they are not [[homology (biology)|homologous]], however: unlike those of vertebrates, these are composed of a thickened [[basement membrane]] extending from the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]]. An additional caudal fin covers the post-anal tail.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; Two chaetognath species, ''Caecosagitta macrocephala'' and ''Eukrohnia fowleri'', have [[bioluminescent]] organs on their fins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Haddock, S. H. D.  |author2=J. F. Case |date=20 January 1994 |title=A bioluminescent chaetognath |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=367 |issue=6460 |pages=225–226 |doi=10.1038/367225a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thuesen, E. V. |author2=F. E. Goetz |author3=S. H. D. Haddock |author3link=Steven Haddock |last-author-amp=yes |date=October 2010 |title=Bioluminescent organs of two deep-sea arrow worms, ''Eukrohnia fowleri'' and ''Caecosagitta macrocephala'', with further observations on bioluminescence in chaetognaths |journal=[[The Biological Bulletin]] |volume=219 |pages=100–111 |pmid=20972255 |issue=2|doi=10.1086/BBLv219n2p100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaetognaths swim in short bursts using a dorso-ventral undulating body motion, where their tail fin assists with propulsion and the body fins with stabilization and steering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jordan, C. E. |year=1992 |title=A model of rapid-start swimming at intermediate Reynolds number: undulatory locomotion in the chaetognath ''Sagitta elegans'' |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Biology]] |volume=163 |issue=1 |pages=119–137 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/163/1/119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species are known to use the [[neurotoxin]] [[tetrodotoxin]] to subdue prey.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bone, Kapp &amp; Pierrot-Bults|Thuesen, E. V. 1991]], "The Tetrodotoxin Venom of Chaetognaths," pp. 55–60&lt;/ref&gt;

The body cavity is lined by [[peritoneum]], and therefore represents a true [[coelom]], and is divided into one compartment on each side of the trunk, and additional compartments inside the head and tail, all separated completely by septa.  Although they have a mouth with one or two rows of tiny teeth, compound eyes, and a nervous system, they have no respiratory or circulatory systems.

The mouth opens into a muscular [[pharynx]], which contains glands to lubricate the passage of food. From here, a straight intestine runs the length of the trunk to an [[anus]] just forward of the tail. The intestine is the primary site of digestion and includes a pair of [[diverticulum|diverticula]] near the anterior end.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; Materials are moved about the body cavity by [[cilia]]. Waste materials are simply excreted through the skin and anus.

The nervous system is reasonably simple, consisting of a [[ganglion]]ated nerve ring surrounding the pharynx. The dorsal ganglion is the largest, but nerves extend from all the ganglia along the length of the body. Chaetognaths have two compound eyes, each consisting of a number of pigment-cup [[ocelli]] fused together. In addition, there are a number of sensory bristles arranged in rows along the side of the body, where they probably perform a function similar to that of the [[lateral line]] in fish. An additional, curved, band of sensory bristles lies over the head and neck.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

The arrow worm [[rhabdomere]]s are derived from [[microtubule]]s 20&amp;nbsp;nm long and 50&amp;nbsp;nm wide, which in turn form conical bodies that contain granules and thread structures. The cone body is derived from a [[cilium]].&lt;ref&gt;"Photoreception". Encyclopædia Britannica from [[Encyclopædia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] . 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
All species are [[hermaphroditic]], carrying both [[ovum|eggs]] and [[spermatozoon|sperm]].&lt;ref name="Bone" /&gt; Each animal possesses a pair of [[testis|testes]] within the tail, and a pair of [[ovary|ovaries]] in the posterior region of the main body cavity. Immature sperm are released from the testes to mature inside the cavity of the tail, and then swim through a short duct to a [[seminal vesicle]] where they are packaged into a [[spermatophore]].&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;(Sexually and Asexually)

During mating, each individual places a spermatophore onto the neck of its partner after rupture of the seminal vesicle. The sperm rapidly escape from the spermatophore and swim along the midline of the animal until they reach a pair of small pores just in front of the tail. These pores connect to the [[oviduct]]s, into which the developed eggs have already passed from the ovaries, and it is here that fertilisation takes place.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

The eggs are planktonic, or attached to [[alga]]e, and hatch into miniature versions of the adult, without a well-defined [[larva]]l stage.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt;

== Classification ==
Chaetognaths are traditionally classed as [[deuterostomes]] by [[embryologist]]s. [[Lynn Margulis]] and K. V. Schwartz place chaetognaths in the deuterostomes in their ''Five Kingdom'' classification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sn2000.taxonomy.nl/Taxonomicon/TaxonTree.aspx?id=40615 Systema Naturae 2000 Taxon: Phylum Chaetognatha per Margulis and Schwartz] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127153818/http://sn2000.taxonomy.nl/Taxonomicon/TaxonTree.aspx?id=40615 |date=November 27, 2005 }} (select Margulis &amp; Schwartz in 'Classification by')—last retrieved November 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular [[phylogeny|phylogenist]]s, however, consider them to be [[protostomes]]. [[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]] places them in the protostomes in his ''Six Kingdom'' classification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sn2000.taxonomy.nl/Taxonomicon/TaxonTree.aspx?id=40615 Systema Naturae 2000 Taxon: Phylum Chaetognatha per Cavalier-Smith] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127153818/http://sn2000.taxonomy.nl/Taxonomicon/TaxonTree.aspx?id=40615 |date=November 27, 2005 }} (select Cavalier-Smith in 'Classification by')—last retrieved November 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The similarities between chaetognaths and nematodes mentioned above may support the protostome thesis—in fact, chaetognaths are sometimes regarded as a basal [[ecdysozoa]]n or [[lophotrochozoa]]n.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Matus, D. Q.|date=8 August 2006|title=Broad taxon and gene sampling indicate that chaetognaths are protostomes|journal =[[Current Biology]]|volume=16|issue=15|pages=R575–R576|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.07.017|pmid=16890509|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaetognatha appears close to the base of the protostome tree in most studies of their molecular phylogeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marletaz, F. |date=8 August 2006|title=Chaetognath phylogenomics: a protostome with deuterostome-like development|journal=[[Current Biology]]|volume=16 |issue=15 |pages=R577–R578 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.07.016 |pmid=16890510|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may explain their deuterostome embryonic characters. If chaetognaths branched off from the protostomes before they evolved their distinctive protostome embryonic characters, they might have retained deuterostome characters inherited from early [[bilateria]]n ancestors. Thus chaetognaths may be a useful model for the ancestral bilaterian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/molbev/msh229 |pmid=15306659 |title=Identification of Chaetognaths as Protostomes is Supported by the Analysis of Their Mitochondrial Genome |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=2122–9 |year=2004 |last1=Papillon |first1=Daniel |last2=Perez |first2=Yvan |last3=Caubit |first3=Xavier |last4=Le Parco |first4=Yannick }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fossil record ==
Due to their soft bodies, chaetognaths fossilize poorly. Even so, several fossil chaetognath species have been described.&lt;ref name="Vannier2007" /&gt; Chaetognaths appear to have originated in the [[Cambrian]] Period. Complete body fossils have been formally described from the Lower [[Cambrian]] [[Maotianshan shales]] of [[Yunnan, China]] (''Eognathacantha ercainella'' Chen &amp; Huang&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=J.-Y. |last2=Huang |first2=D.-Y. |date=4 October 2002 |title=A possible Lower Cambrian chaetognath (arrow worm) |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=298 |issue =5591 |page=187|pmid=12364798|doi=10.1126/science.1075059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Protosagitta spinosa'' Hu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hu |first1=S.-X. |year=2005 |title=Taphonomy and palaeoecology of the Early Cambrian Chengjiang Biota from Eastern Yunnan, China |journal=Berliner Paläobiologische Abhandlungen |volume=7 |issue= |pages=1–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the Middle Cambrian [[Burgess Shale]] of British Columbia (''[[Oesia|Oesia disjuncta]]'' Walcott&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szaniawski |first1=H. |year=2005 |title=Cambrian chaetognaths recognized in Burgess Shale fossils |journal=[[Acta Palaeontologica Polonica]] |volume=50 |issue =1 |pages=1–8 |url=http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app50/app50-001.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;), a view challenged by Conway Morris (2009). A more recent chaetognath, ''Paucijaculum samamithion'' Schram, has been described from the Mazon Creek biota from the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] of Illinois. Chaetognaths were thought possibly to be related to some of the animals grouped with the [[conodont]]s. The conodonts themselves, however, are thought to be related to the [[vertebrates]]. It is now thought that [[protoconodont]] elements (e.g., ''[[Protohertzina]] anabarica'' Missarzhevsky, 1973), are probably grasping spines of chaetognaths rather than teeth of conodonts. Previously chaetognaths in the Early Cambrian were only suspected from these protoconodont elements, but the more recent discoveries of body fossils have confirmed their presence then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Szaniawski |first1=H. |year=2002 |title=New evidence for the protoconodont origin of chaetognaths |journal=[[Acta Palaeontologica Polonica]] |volume=47 |issue=3 |url=http://www.app.pan.pl/archive/published/app47/app47-405.pdf |format=PDF| pages=405–419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software was written by Professor [[Nigel Howard (professor)|Nigel Howard]] for General [[Rupert Smith]] in 1996.]]
'''Confrontation analysis''' (also known as '''dilemma analysis''') is an [[operational analysis]] technique used to structure, understand and think through multi-party interactions such as negotiations. It is the underpinning mathematical basis of [[drama theory]]. 

It is derived from [[game theory]] but considers that instead of resolving the game, the players often redefine the game when interacting. Emotions triggered from the potential interaction play a large part in this redefinition. So whereas game theory looks on an interaction as a single decision matrix and resolves that, confrontation analysis looks on the interaction as a sequence of linked interactions, where the decision matrix changes under the influence of precisely defined emotional ''dilemmas''.&lt;ref name="dilemm"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=17 definition of Dilemma]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation and use==

Confrontation analysis was devised by Professor [[Nigel Howard (professor)|Nigel Howard]] in the early 1990s drawing from his work on game theory and [[metagame analysis]]. It has been turned to defence,&lt;ref name="dw1"&gt;See [http://www.decisionworkshops.com/#/the-future-of-libya/4553627902 The future of Libya]&lt;/ref&gt; political, legal, financial&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;"role playing... can also be used by investors in the form of "confrontation analysis' such as that organised by former military analyst [[Michael Young (former military analyst)|Mike Young's]] [http://www.decisionworkshops.com Decision Workshops]" –  ''Greek Dungeons and German Dragons'', James Macintosh, ''[[Financial Times]]'', 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and commercial &lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.decisionworkshops.com/#/letting-agency/4550567082 Letting agency case study]&lt;/ref&gt; applications.

Much of the theoretical background to General [[Rupert Smith]]'s book ''[[The Utility of Force]]'' drew its inspiration from the theory of confrontation analysis.{{quotation|I am in debt to Professor Nigel Howard, whose explanation of Confrontation Analysis and Game Theory at a seminar in 1998 excited my interest. Our subsequent discussions helped me to order my thoughts and the lessons I had learned into a coherent structure with the result that, for the first time, I was able to understand my experiences within a theoretical model which allowed me to use them further|General Rupert Smith|[[The Utility of Force]] (p.xvi)}}

Confrontation analysis can also be used in a ''decision workshop'' as structure to support role-playing&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt; for training, analysis and decision rehearsal.

== Method ==
[[Image:BosniaConfrontation0.JPG|thumb|361px|left|An interaction as a sequence of confrontations where the ''card table''&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; changes as the parties struggle to eliminate their ''dilemmas''&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt;]]
Confrontation analysis looks on an interaction as a sequence of confrontations. During each confrontation the parties communicate until they have made their ''positions''&lt;ref name="posn"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=29 definition of Position]&lt;/ref&gt; clear to one another.  These positions can be expressed as a ''card table'' (also known as an options board&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=29 definition of Options Board/Card table]&lt;/ref&gt;) of yes/no decisions. For each decision each party communicates what they would like to happen (their ''position''&lt;ref name="posn"/&gt;) and what will happen if they cannot agree (the ''threatened future''). These interactions produce ''dilemmas''&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt; and the ''card table'' changes as players attempt to eliminate these.

[[Image:BosniaConfrontation1.JPG|thumb|x250px|right|Initial Card Table:&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; The UN threatens to use air strikes, but is not believed by the Bosnian Serbs: The UN has three dilemmas&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt; The Bosnians have none]]
Consider the example on the [[:File:BosniaConfrontation2.JPG|right]] (Initial Card Table), taken from the [[Bosnian War#1995|1995 Bosnian Conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;This example developed from that described in [[Rupert Smith|Smith R]], Tait A, Howard N (1999) [http://www.decisionmechanics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/warandpeace.pdf Confrontations in War and Peace]. ''Proceedings of the 6th international Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium'', U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, 19–20 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; This represents an interaction between the Bosnian Serbs and the United Nations forces over the safe areas. The [[Bosnian Serbs]] had [[Bosniak]] enclaves surrounded and were threatening to attack.

Each side had a position as to what they wanted to happen:

The Bosnian Serbs wanted (see 4th column):
* To be able to attack the enclaves
* NOT to withdraw their heavy weapons from the enclaves
* For the UN NOT to use air strikes
The UN wanted (See 5th column):
* The Bosnian Serbs NOT to attack the enclaves
* The Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons
* The Bosnian Serbs NOT to take hostages.
If no further changes were made then what the sides were saying would happen was (see 1st column):
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would attack the enclaves
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would NOT withdraw their heavy weapons
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would take hostages if the UN uses air strikes
*The UN said it would initiate air strikes.  However the Bosnian Serbs DID NOT BELIEVE them. (Hence the question mark on the Card Table).

Confrontation analysis then specifies a number of precisely defined ''dilemmas''&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt; that occur to the parties following from the structure of the card tables.  It states that motivated by the desire to eliminate these dilemmas, the parties involved will CHANGE THE CARD TABLE, to eliminate their problem.

In the situation at the start the Bosnian Serbs have no dilemmas, but the UN has four. It has three ''persuasion dilemmas''&lt;ref name="pd"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=32 definition of Persuasion Dilemma]&lt;/ref&gt; in that the Bosnian Serbs are not going to do the three things they want them to (not attack the enclaves, withdraw the heavy weapons and not take hostages). It also has a ''rejection dilemma''&lt;ref name="rd"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=40 definition of Rejection Dilemma]&lt;/ref&gt; in that the Bosnian Serbs do not believe they will actually use the air strikes, as they think the UN will submit to their position, for fear of having hostages taken.

Faced with these dilemmas, the UN modified the card table to eliminate its dilemmas.  It took two actions:

Firstly, it withdrew its forces from the positions where they were vulnerable to being taken hostage.  This action eliminated the Bosnian Serbs' option (card) of taking hostages.

[[Image:BosniaConfrontation2.JPG|thumb|x250px|right|Second Card Table:&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; The UN eliminated the Bosnian "hostage" card and brought in an additional, credible "Artillery" card, changing the situation in their favour: The Bosnian Serbs now have two ''persuasion dilemmas''&lt;ref name="pd"/&gt; and two ''rejection dilemmas''&lt;ref name="rd"/&gt;]]
Secondly, with the addition of the [[Rapid Reaction Force]], and in particular its artillery the UN had an additional capability to engage Bosnian Serb weapons; they added the card "Use artillery against Bosnian Serbs". Because of this, the UN's threat of air strikes became more credible.  The situation changed to that of the Second Card Table:

The Bosnian Serbs wanted (see 4th column):
* To be able to attack the enclaves
* NOT to withdraw heavy weapons from the enclaves
* For the UN NOT to use air strikes
* For the UN NOT to use artillery
The UN wanted (See 5th column):
* The Bosnian Serbs NOT to attack the enclaves
* The Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons
If no further changes were made then what the sides were saying would happen was (see 1st column):
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would attack the enclaves, but the UN did not believe them.
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would NOT withdraw their heavy weapons, but the UN did not believe them.
*The UN said it would use artillery.  The Bosnian Serbs believed this.
*The UN said it would use air strikes.  This time, however, the Bosnian Serbs believed them.

[[Image:BosniaConfrontation3.JPG|thumb|x250px|right|Final Card Table:&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; The final situation. The Bosnian Serbs modified their position to eliminate their dilemmas. This involved accepting their initial goals as unobtainable]]
Faced with this new situation, the Bosnian Serbs modified their position to accept the UN proposal.  The final table was an agreement as shown in the Final Card table (see thumbnail and picture).

Confrontation analysis does not necessarily produce a win-win solution (although end states are more likely to remain stable if they do); however, the word ''confrontation'' should not necessarily imply that any negotiations should be carried out in an aggressive way.

The ''card tables'' or are isomorphic to [[game theory]] models, but are not built with the aim of finding a ''solution''. Instead, the aim is to find the dilemmas facing characters and so help to predict how they will change the table itself. Such prediction requires not only analysis of the model and its dilemmas, but also exploration of the reality outside the model; without this it is impossible to decide which ways of changing the model in order to eliminate dilemmas might be rationalized by the characters.

Sometimes analysis of the ticks and crosses can be supported by values showing the payoff to each of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.decisionworkshops.com/#/the-tables-in-a-decision-works/4557003218 understanding the tables used in confrontation analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corpus linguistics''' is the [[study of language]] as expressed in ''[[Text corpus|corpora]]'' (bodies) of "real world" text. The text-corpus method is a digestive approach that derives a set of abstract rules that govern a [[natural language]] from texts in that language, and explores how that language relates to other languages. Originally derived manually, corpora now are automatically derived from source texts. Corpus linguistics proposes that reliable language analysis is more feasible with corpora collected in the field in its natural context ("realia"), and with minimal experimental-interference.

The field of corpus linguistics features divergent views about the value of corpus annotation. These views range from [[John McHardy Sinclair]], who advocates  minimal annotation so texts speak for themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, J. 'The automatic analysis of corpora', in Svartvik, J. (ed.) ''Directions in Corpus Linguistics (Proceedings of Nobel Symposium 82)''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Survey of English Usage]] team ([[University College, London]]), who advocate annotation as allowing greater linguistic understanding through rigorous recording.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, S. 'Annotation, Retrieval and Experimentation', in Meurman-Solin, A. &amp; Nurmi, A.A. (ed.) Annotating Variation and Change. Helsinki: Varieng, [University of Helsinki]. 2007. [http://www.helsinki.fi/varieng/journal/volumes/01/wallis e-Published]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Linguistics}}
Some of the earliest efforts at grammatical description were based at least in part on corpora of particular religious or cultural significance.  For example, [[Pratisakhya|Prātiśākhya]] literature described the sound patterns of [[Sanskrit]] as found in the [[Vedas]], and 
[[Pāṇini]]'s grammar of [[classical Sanskrit]] was based at least in part on analysis of that same corpus.  Similarly, the early [[Arabic grammar#History|Arabic grammarians]] paid particular attention to the language of the [[Quran]].  In the Western European tradition, scholars prepared [[Bible concordance|concordances]] to allow detailed study of the language of the Bible and other canonical texts.

A landmark in modern corpus linguistics was the publication by [[Henry Kučera]] and [[W. Nelson Francis]] of ''Computational Analysis of Present-Day American English'' in 1967, a work based on the analysis of the [[Brown Corpus]], a carefully compiled selection of current American English, totalling about a million words drawn from a wide variety of sources. Kučera and Francis subjected it to a variety of computational analyses, from which they compiled a rich and variegated opus, combining elements of linguistics, language teaching, [[psychology]], statistics, and [[sociology]]. A further key publication was [[Randolph Quirk]]'s 'Towards a description of English Usage' (1960)&lt;ref&gt;Quirk, R. 'Towards a description of English Usage', ''Transactions of the Philological Society''. 1960. 40–61.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he introduced [[Survey of English Usage|The Survey of English Usage]].

Shortly thereafter, Boston publisher [[Houghton-Mifflin]] approached Kučera to supply a million-word, three-line citation base for its new ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]]'', the first [[dictionary]] compiled using corpus linguistics. The AHD took the innovative step of combining prescriptive elements (how language ''should'' be used) with descriptive information (how it actually ''is'' used).

Other publishers followed suit. The British publisher Collins' [[COBUILD]] [[monolingual learner's dictionary]], designed for users learning [[English language learning and teaching|English as a foreign language]], was compiled using the [[Bank of English]]. The [[Survey of English Usage]] Corpus was used in the development of one of the most important Corpus-based Grammars, the ''Comprehensive Grammar of English'' (Quirk ''et al.'' 1985).&lt;ref&gt;Quirk, R., Greenbaum, S., Leech, G. and Svartvik, J. ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'' London: Longman. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brown Corpus]] has also spawned a number of similarly structured corpora: the [[LOB Corpus]] (1960s [[British English]]), Kolhapur ([[Indian English]]), Wellington ([[New Zealand English]]), Australian Corpus of English ([[Australian English]]), the Frown Corpus ([[early 1990s]] [[American English]]), and the FLOB Corpus (1990s British English). Other corpora represent many languages, varieties and modes, and include the [[International Corpus of English]], and the [[British National Corpus]], a 100 million word collection of a range of spoken and written texts, created in the 1990s by a consortium of publishers, universities ([[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]]) and the [[British Library]]. For contemporary American English, work has stalled on the [[American National Corpus]], but the 400+ million word [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]] (1990–present) is now available through a web interface.

The first computerized corpus of transcribed spoken language was constructed in 1971 by the Montreal French Project,&lt;ref&gt;Sankoff, D. &amp; Sankoff, G. Sample survey methods and computer-assisted analysis in the study of grammatical variation. In Darnell R. (ed.) ''Canadian Languages in their Social Context'' Edmonton: Linguistic Research Incorporated. 1973. 7–64.&lt;/ref&gt; containing one million words, which inspired [[Shana Poplack]]'s much larger corpus of spoken French in the Ottawa-Hull area.&lt;ref&gt;Poplack, S. The care and handling of a mega-corpus. In Fasold, R. &amp; Schiffrin D. (eds.) ''Language Change and Variation'', Amsterdam: Benjamins. 1989. 411–451.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides these corpora of living languages, computerized corpora have also been made of collections of texts in ancient languages. An example is the [[Francis Andersen|Andersen]]-Forbes database of the Hebrew Bible, developed since the 1970s, in which every clause is parsed using graphs representing up to seven levels of syntax, and every segment tagged with seven fields of information.&lt;ref&gt;

This is a recent project with multiple layers of annotation including morphological segmentation, [[part-of-speech tagging]], and syntactic analysis using dependency grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Dukes, K., Atwell, E. and Habash, N. 'Supervised Collaboration for Syntactic Annotation of Quranic Arabic'. ''Language Resources and Evaluation Journal''. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides pure linguistic inquiry, researchers had begun to apply corpus linguistics to other academic and professional fields, such as the emerging sub-discipline of [[Law and Corpus Linguistics|law and corpus linguistics]], which seeks to understand legal texts using corpus data and tools.

== Methods ==
Corpus linguistics has generated a number of research methods, which attempt to trace a path from data to theory. Wallis and Nelson (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, S. and Nelson G. ''Knowledge discovery in grammatically analysed corpora''. ''Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery'', '''5''': 307–340. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; first introduced what they called the 3A perspective:  Annotation, Abstraction and Analysis.

* '''Annotation''' consists of the application of a scheme to texts. Annotations may include structural markup, [[Lexical category|part-of-speech]] tagging, parsing, and numerous other representations.
* '''Abstraction''' consists of the translation (mapping) of terms in the scheme to terms in a theoretically motivated model or dataset. Abstraction typically includes linguist-directed search but may include e.g., rule-learning for parsers.
* '''Analysis''' consists of statistically probing, manipulating and generalising from the dataset. Analysis might include statistical evaluations, optimisation of rule-bases or knowledge discovery methods.

Most lexical corpora today are part-of-speech-tagged (POS-tagged). However even corpus linguists who work with 'unannotated plain text' inevitably apply some method to isolate salient terms. In such situations annotation and abstraction are combined in a lexical search.

The advantage of publishing an annotated corpus is that other users can then perform experiments on the corpus (through [[corpus manager]]s). Linguists with other interests and differing perspectives than the originators' can exploit this work. By sharing data, corpus linguists are able to treat the corpus as a locus of linguistic debate, rather than as an exhaustive fount of knowledge.

Recent studies have suggested treatment outcome in adolescents with [[social anxiety disorder]] can also be assessed by analysing language by means of Corpus Linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Lopez, L. J, Bedmar, MB, Perez-Paredes, P, &amp; Tornero, E. (2011). TREATMENT CHANGE IN ADOLESCENTS WITH SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER: INSIGHTS FROM CORPUS LINGUISTICS. Ansiedad y Estres, 17, 149-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Crown Closure Aerial Photo.jpg|right|thumb|Aerial Overview of Crown Closure]]

'''Crown closure''' is a term used in [[forestry]]. '''Crown closure''' and '''crown cover''' are two slightly different measures of the forest canopy and that determine the amount of light able to penetrate to the forest floor.

Crown closure, also known as canopy closure, is an integrated measure of the canopy "over a segment of the sky hemisphere above one point on the ground".&lt;Ref&gt;Jennings, S.B., N.D. Brown, and D. Sheil. 1999. Assessing forest canopies and
understorey illumination: Canopy closure, canopy cover and other measures. Forestry 72(1):59-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Crown cover is the proportion of a stand covered by the crowns of live trees.

A [[stand level modelling|forest stand]] can have a crown cover of 100% and a crown closure less than 100%.  Typical stands with 100% cover but low closure are coffee [[agroforestry]] stands, where overlapping parasol-shaped crowns ensure complete cover but still allow light to penetrate at an oblique angle to the forest floor.

==Basic concepts==

Crown closure helps predict volume, stand density, [[crown width]], and [[crown competition factor]]. Crown closure is often determined using aerial photographs because ground evaluations become difficult to obtain. Stands are usually placed in to different classes (1-6) after viewing the [[aerial photographs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sres-associated.anu.edu.au/mensuration/author.htm Brack, Chris. 1999. Crown Closure. ANU]&lt;/ref&gt;

# Very Sparse 1–9%
# Sparse 10–29%
# Low 30–49%
# Medium 50–69%
# Dense 70–84%
# Very Dense 85–100%

Although sometimes referred to as canopy cover and canopy closure, crown closure is different from these two concepts. Canopy cover represents the aggregate of all vertically projected tree crowns onto the ground surface, while canopy closure represents the amount of the sky obscured by the canopy from a certain point on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.eri.nau.edu/gsdl/collect/erilibra/import/Egan_2010_FactSheet_CanopyCover.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ground measurement==

Each tree’s measurements are used to calculate the area projected by the [[crown (botany)|crown]] onto the ground. Summing the crown areas for all trees measured on a fixed plot area and dividing by the ground area will give the crown closure. The "moosehorn" crown closure estimator is a device for measuring crown closure from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, G.A. 1949. Uses and modifications for the "moosehorn" crown closure estimator. [[Journal of Forestry]] 47(9):733:735.&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods for estimating crown closure include the use of line-intercept, spherical densiometer, and [[hemispherical photography]].&lt;ref&gt;Fiala, A.C.S.. Garman, S.L., and A.N. Gray. 2006. Comparison of five canopy cover estimation techniques in the western Oregon Cascades. [[Forest Ecology and Management]] 232:186-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Exact cover measurements should be made in vertical direction, or the cover percent will be overestimated.&lt;ref name="jennings"&gt;Jennings, S. B., Brown, N. D., &amp; Sheil, D. 1999. Assessing forest canopies and understorey illumination: canopy closure, canopy cover and other measures. Forestry 72(1): 59–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aerial measurement==

Aerial photographs made at scales of 1:15,000 or larger can be used to determine crown closure estimates, usually done by ocular interpretation, by grouping stands into percent classes.&lt;ref name="avery"&gt;Avery, T.E. and Burkhart, H.E. 2002. Forest Measurements. 5th edition. McGraw Hill, New York. 456 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Low density stands make for an easy ocular estimation, but as the stand density increases the ocular estimates become more difficult to obtain. In dense stands, overestimates or underestimates of crown closure can be made and predicting value of stand volume becomes more reduced.&lt;ref name="spur"&gt;Spur, S.H. 1952. [[Forest Inventory]] Ronald Press, New York. 476p.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Development theory''' is a collection of [[theory|theories]] about how desirable change in society is best achieved. Such theories draw on a variety of social science disciplines and approaches. In this article, multiple theories are discussed, as are recent developments with regard to these theories. Depending on which theory that is being looked at, there are different explanations to the process of development and their inequalities.

== Modernization theory ==

{{Main|Modernization theory}}

Modernization theory is used to analyze the processes in which modernization in societies take place. The theory looks at which aspects of countries are beneficial and which constitute obstacles for [[economic development]]. The idea is that [[development assistance]] targeted at those particular aspects can lead to modernization of 'traditional' or 'backward' societies. Scientists from various research disciplines have contributed to modernization theory.

=== Sociological and anthropological modernization theory ===
The earliest principles of modernization theory can be derived from the idea of progress, which stated that people can develop and change their society themselves. [[Marquis de Condorcet]] was involved in the origins of this theory. This theory also states that technological advancements and economic changes can lead to changes in moral and cultural values. The French [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] stressed the interdependence of institutions in a society and the way in which they interact with cultural and social unity. His work ‘[[The Division of Labor in Society]]’ was very influential. It described how social order is maintained in society and ways in which primitive societies can make the transition to more advanced societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://durkheim.uchicago.edu/Summaries/dl.html |title=The Division of Labor in Society (1893) |publisher=Durkheim.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scientists who have contributed to the development of modernization theory are: [[David Apter]], who did research on the political system and history of democracy; [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], who argued that economic development leads to social changes which tend to lead to democracy; [[David McClelland]], who approached modernization from the psychological side with his motivations theory; and [[Talcott Parsons]] who used his pattern variables to compare backwardness to modernity.

=== Linear stages of growth model ===
The linear stages of growth model is an economic model which is heavily inspired by the [[Marshall Plan]] which was used to revitalize Europe’s economy after [[World War II]]. It assumes that [[economic growth]] can only be achieved by [[industrialization]]. Growth can be restricted by local institutions and social [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], especially if these aspects influence the [[savings rate]] and investments. The constraints impeding economic growth are thus considered by this model to be internal to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khun |first=Alex |url=http://ourdevelopment.blogspot.nl/2008/08/critical-review-of-modernisation-theory.html |title=Inform Educate Action: Critical Review of Modernisation Theory |publisher=Ourdevelopment.blogspot.nl |date=2008-08-06 |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the linear stages of growth model, a correctly designed massive injection of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] coupled with intervention by the [[public sector]] would ultimately lead to industrialization and [[economic development]] of a [[developing nation]].&lt;ref name="wiley1959"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cairncross | first1 = A. K. | title = The Stages of Economic Growth | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-0289.1959.tb01829.x | journal = The Economic History Review | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 450–458 | year = 1961 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rostow's stages of growth]] model is the most well-known example of the linear stages of growth model.&lt;ref name="wiley1959" /&gt; [[Walt W. Rostow]] identified five stages through which developing countries had to pass to reach an advanced economy status: (1) Traditional society, (2) Preconditions for take-off, (3) Take-off, (4) Drive to maturity, (5) Age of high mass consumption. He argued that economic development could be led by certain strong sectors; this is in contrast to for instance [[Marxism]] which states that sectors should develop equally. According to Rostow’s model, a country needed to follow some rules of development to reach the take-off: (1) The investment rate of a country needs to be increased to at least 10% of its [[GDP]], (2) One or two [[manufacturing]] sectors with a high rate of growth need to be established, (3) An institutional, political and social framework has to exist or be created in order to promote the expansion of those sectors.&lt;ref name="mtholyoke1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ipe/rostow.htm |title=W.W. Rostow, The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1960), Chapter 2, "The Five Stages of Growth-A Summary," pp. 4-16 |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rostow model has serious flaws, of which the most serious are: (1) The model assumes that development can be achieved through a basic sequence of stages which are the same for all countries, a doubtful assumption; (2) The model measures development solely by means of the increase of GDP per capita; (3) The model focuses on characteristics of development, but does not identify the causal factors which lead development to occur. As such, it neglects the [[social structures]] that have to be present to foster development.&lt;ref name="mtholyoke1" /&gt;

Economic modernization theories such as Rostow's stages model have been heavily inspired by the [[Harrod-Domar model]] which explains in a mathematical way the growth rate of a country in terms of the savings rate and the productivity of capital.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econ.washington.edu/user/thornj/Harrod-Domar06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy state involvement has often been considered necessary for successful development in economic modernization theory; [[Paul Rosenstein-Rodan]], [[Ragnar Nurkse]] and [[Kurt Mandelbaum]] argued that a [[big push model]] in infrastructure investment and planning was necessary for the stimulation of industrialization, and that the private sector would not be able to provide the resources for this on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professor-frithjof-kuhnen.de/publications/causes-of-underdevelopment/1-2-4.htm |title='Big |publisher=Professor-frithjof-kuhnen.de |date= |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another influential theory of modernization is the [[dual-sector model]] by [[Arthur Lewis (economist)|Arthur Lewis]]. In this model Lewis explained how the traditional stagnant [[rural sector]] is gradually replaced by a growing modern and dynamic  manufacturing and [[service economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/33695739/The-Lewis-Theory-of-Development |title=The Lewis Theory of Development |publisher=Scribd.com |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the focus on the need for investments in capital, the Linear Stages of Growth Models are sometimes referred to as suffering from ‘capital fundamentalism’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&amp;theSitePK=544849&amp;piPK=64165421&amp;menuPK=64166093&amp;entityID=000009265_3961006071037 |title=Trade Research – Report Details |publisher=Econ.worldbank.org |date=1994-04-30 |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critics of modernization theory ===
[[Modernization theory]] observes traditions and pre-existing institutions of so-called "primitive" societies as obstacles to modern economic growth. Modernization which is forced from outside upon a society might induce violent and radical change, but according to modernization theorists it is generally worth this side effect. Critics point to traditional societies as being destroyed and slipping away to a modern form of poverty without ever gaining the promised advantages of modernization.

== Structuralism ==
{{Main|Structuralist economics}}

Structuralism is a development theory which focuses on structural aspects which impede the economic growth of developing countries. The [[unit of analysis]] is the transformation of a country’s economy from, mainly, a [[subsistence agriculture]] to a modern, urbanized manufacturing and [[service economy]]. Policy prescriptions resulting from structuralist thinking include major [[government intervention]] in the economy to fuel the [[industrial sector]], known as [[import substitution industrialization]] (ISI). This structural transformation of the developing country is pursued in order to create an economy which in the end enjoys self-sustaining growth. This can only be reached by ending the reliance of the underdeveloped country on exports of [[primary goods]] (agricultural and mining products), and pursuing inward-oriented development by shielding the domestic economy from that of the developed economies. Trade with advanced economies is minimized through the erection of all kinds of trade barriers and an overvaluation of the domestic exchange rate; in this way the production of domestic substitutes of formerly imported industrial products is encouraged. The logic of the strategy rests on the [[infant industry argument]], which states that young industries initially do not have the economies of scale and experience to be able to compete with foreign competitors and thus need to be protected until they are able to compete in the free market.&lt;ref&gt;http://eugeniomiravete.com/papers/Infant_Industry_Argument_Miravete01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prebisch–Singer hypothesis]] states that over time the [[terms of trade]] for [[commodities]] deteriorate compared to those for [[manufactured goods]], because the [[income elasticity of demand]] of manufactured goods is greater than that of primary products. If true, this would also support the ISI strategy.

Structuralists argue that the only way [[Third World]] countries can develop is through action by the state. Third world countries have to push industrialization and have to reduce their dependency on trade with the [[First World]], and trade among themselves.

The roots of structuralism lie in [[South America]], and particularly [[Chile]]. In 1950, [[Raul Prebisch]] went to Chile to become the first director of the [[Economic Commission for Latin America]]. In Chile, he cooperated with [[Celso Furtado]], [[Anibal Pinto]], [[Osvaldo Sunkel]], and [[Dudley Seers]], who all became influential structuralists.

== Dependency theory ==
{{Main|Dependency theory}}

Dependency theory is essentially a follow up to structuralist thinking, and shares many of its core ideas. Whereas structuralists did not consider that development would be possible at all unless a strategy of delinking and rigorous [[Import substitution industrialization|ISI]] was pursued, dependency thinking could allow development with external links with the developed parts of the globe. However, this kind of development is considered to be "dependent development", i.e., it does not have an internal domestic dynamic in the developing country and thus remains highly vulnerable to the economic vagaries of the world market. Dependency thinking starts from the notion that resources flow from the ‘[[Periphery countries|periphery]]’ of poor and [[underdeveloped]] states to a ‘[[Core countries|core]]’ of wealthy countries, which leads to accumulation of wealth in the rich states at the expense of the poor states. Contrary to [[modernization theory]], dependency theory states that not all societies progress through similar [[Dual-sector model|stages of development]]. Periphery states have unique features, structures and institutions of their own and are considered weaker with regards to the world [[market economy]], while the developed nations have never been in this colonized position in the past. Dependency theorists argue that underdeveloped countries remain economically vulnerable unless they reduce their connections to the world market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econ.utah.edu/~vernengo/papers/princeton.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324024418/http://www.econ.utah.edu/~vernengo/papers/princeton.pdf |date=March 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/depend.htm |title="Dependency Theory: An Introduction," Vincent Ferraro, Mount Holyoke College, July 1966 |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependency theory states that poor nations provide [[natural resources]] and cheap [[Wage labour|labor]] for [[developed nations]], without which the developed nations could not have the [[standard of living]] which they enjoy. When underdeveloped countries try to remove the Core's influence, the developed countries hinder their attempts to keep control. This means that [[poverty]] of developing nations is not the result of the disintegration of these countries in the [[World-systems theory|world system]], but because of the way in which they are integrated into this system.

In addition to its structuralist roots, dependency theory has much overlap with [[Neo-Marxism]] and [[World Systems Theory]], which is also reflected in the work of [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], a famous dependency theorist. Wallerstein rejects the notion of a Third World, claiming that there is only one world which is connected by economic relations ([[World Systems Theory]]). He argues that this system inherently leads to a division of the world in core, [[semi-periphery]] and [[Periphery countries|periphery]]. One of the results of expansion of the world-system is the [[commodification]] of things, like [[natural resources]], [[Wage labour|labor]] and [[human relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/Wallerstein.asp |title=Internet History Sourcebooks |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/users/f/felwell/www/Theorists/Wallerstein/Presentation/Wallerstein.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic needs ==
{{Main|Basic needs}}

The basic needs model was introduced by the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1976, mainly in reaction to prevalent modernization- and structuralism-inspired development approaches, which were not achieving satisfactory results in terms of poverty alleviation and combating inequality in developing countries. It tried to define an absolute minimum of resources necessary for long-term physical [[well-being]]. The [[poverty line]] which follows from this, is the amount of income needed to satisfy those basic needs. The approach has been applied in the sphere of development assistance, to determine what a society needs for subsistence, and for poor population groups to rise above the poverty line. Basic needs theory does not focus on investing in economically productive activities. Basic needs can be used as an indicator of the absolute minimum an individual needs to survive.

Proponents of basic needs have argued that elimination of [[absolute poverty]] is a good way to make people active in society so that they can provide labor more easily and act as consumers and savers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=762098|title=Basic Needs Strategies, Human Rights, and the Right to Development|first=Frances|last=Stewart|date=1 January 1989|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|volume=11|issue=3|pages=347–374|doi=10.2307/762098}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been also many critics of the basic needs approach. It would lack theoretical rigour, practical precision, be in conflict with [[Economic growth|growth promotion policies]], and run the risk of leaving developing countries in permanent.

== Neoclassical theory ==

Neoclassical development theory has it origins in its predecessor: [[classical economics]]. Classical economics was developed in the 18th and 19th centuries and dealt with the value of products and on which production factors it depends. Early contributors to this theory are [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]]. Classical economists argued – as do the neoclassical ones – in favor of the [[free market]], and against [[government intervention]] in those markets. The '[[invisible hand]]' of Adam Smith makes sure that [[free trade]] will ultimately benefit all of society. [[John Maynard Keynes]] was a very influential classical economist as well, having written his [[General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money]] in 1936.

Neoclassical development theory became influential towards the end of the 1970s, fired by the election of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the UK and [[Ronald Reagan]] in the USA. Also, the [[World Bank]] shifted from its Basic Needs approach to a neoclassical approach in 1980. From the beginning of the 1980s, neoclassical development theory really began to roll out.

=== Structural adjustment ===

One of the implications of the neoclassical development theory for developing countries were the [[Structural adjustment|Structural Adjustment Programmes]] (SAPs) which the World Bank and the [[International Monetary Fund]] wanted them to adapt. Important aspects of those SAPs include:
* [[Fiscal austerity]] (reduction in [[government spending]])
* [[Privatization]] (which should both raise money for governments and improve efficiency and financial performance of the firms involved)
* [[Trade liberalization]], [[currency devaluation]] and the abolition of [[marketing board]]s (to maximize the static [[comparative advantage]] the developing country has on the [[global market]])
* Retrenchment of the government and [[deregulation]] (in order to stimulate the free market)

These measures are more or less reflected by the themes which were identified by the Institute of International Economics which were believed to be necessary for the recovery of [[Latin America]] from the [[Latin American debt crisis|economic and financial crises of the 1980s]]. These themes are known as the [[Washington consensus]], a termed coined in 1989 by the economist [[John Williamson (economist)|John Williamson]].

== Recent trends ==

=== Post-development theory ===
{{Main|Postdevelopment theory}}

Postdevelopment theory is a [[school of thought]] which questions the idea of national [[economic development]] altogether. According to postdevelopment scholars, the goal of improving [[living standards]] leans on arbitrary claims as to the desirability and possibility of that goal. Postdevelopment theory arose in the 1980s and 1990s.

According to postdevelopment theorists, the idea of development is just a 'mental structure' ([[Wolfgang Sachs]]) which has resulted in a [[hierarchy]] of developed and underdeveloped nations, of which the [[underdeveloped nations]] desire to be like [[developed nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, Wolfgang (1992). The Development Dictionary: A Guide to Knowledge as Power. Zed Books. {{ISBN|1-85649-044-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Development thinking has been dominated by the West and is very [[ethnocentric]], according to Sachs. The Western lifestyle may neither be a realistic nor a desirable goal for the world's population, postdevelopment theorists argue. Development is being seen as a loss of a country's own culture, people's perception of themselves and modes of life. According to [[Majid Rahnema]], another leading postdevelopment scholar, things like notions of poverty are very culturally embedded and can differ a lot among cultures. The institutes which voice the concern over underdevelopment are very Western-oriented, and postdevelopment calls for a broader cultural involvement in development thinking.

Postdevelopment proposes a vision of [[society]] which removes itself from the ideas which currently dominate it. According to [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]], postdevelopment is interested instead in local culture and knowledge, a critical view against established sciences and the promotion of local [[grassroots]] movements. Also, postdevelopment argues for [[structural change]] in order to reach [[solidarity]], [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], and a larger involvement of [[traditional knowledge]].

=== Sustainable development ===
{{Main|Sustainable development}}

Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. ([[Brundtland Commission]]) There exist more definitions of sustainable development, but they all have to do with the [[Carrying capacity|carrying capacity of the earth]] and its [[Systems ecology|natural systems]] and the challenges faced by humanity. Sustainable development can be broken up into [[environmental sustainability]], economic sustainability and [[sociopolitical]] sustainability. The book '[[Limits to Growth]]', commissioned by the [[Club of Rome]], gave huge momentum to the thinking about sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Meadows et al. (1972), The Limits to Growth, Universe Books, {{ISBN|0-87663-165-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Global warming]] issues are also problems which are emphasized by the sustainable development movement. This led to the 1997 [[Kyoto Accord]], with the plan to cap [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas emissions]].

Opponents of the implications of sustainable development often point to the environmental [[Kuznets curve]]. The idea behind this curve is that, as an economy grows, it shifts towards more [[Capital intensive industry|capital and knowledge-intensive production]]. This means that as an economy grows, its pollution output increases, but only until it reaches a particular threshold where production becomes less resource-intensive and more sustainable. This means that a pro-growth, not an anti-growth policy is needed to solve the environmental problem. But the evidence for the environmental [[Simon Kuznets|Kuznets]] curve is quite weak. Also, empirically spoken, people tend to consume more products when their income increases. Maybe those products have been produced in a more environmentally friendly way, but on the whole the higher consumption negates this effect. There are people like [[Julian Simon]] however who argue that future technological developments will resolve future problems.

=== Human development theory ===
{{Main|Human development theory}}

Human development theory is a theory which uses ideas from different origins, such as [[ecology]], [[sustainable development]], [[feminism]] and [[welfare economics]]. It wants to avoid [[Normative economics|normative politics]] and is focused on how [[social capital]] and [[instructional capital]] can be deployed to optimize the overall value of [[human capital]] in an economy.

[[Amartya Sen]] and [[Mahbub ul Haq]] are the most well-known human development theorists. The work of Sen is focused on [[Capability approach|capabilities]]: what people can do and be. It is these capabilities, rather than the income or goods that they receive (as in the Basic Needs approach), that determine their well being. This core idea also underlies the construction of the Human Development Index, a human-focused measure of development pioneered by the UNDP in its Human Development Reports; this approach has become popular the world over, with indexes and reports published by individual counties, including the [[Measure of America|American Human Development Index and Repor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t in the United States. The economic side of Sen's work can best be categorized under [[welfare economics]], which evaluates the effects of economic policies on the [[well-being]] of peoples. Sen wrote the influential book '[[Development as freedom]]' which added an important [[ethical]] side to [[development economics]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qm8HtpFHYecC |title=Development as Freedom – Amartya Sen – Google Boeken |date= 2001-01-18|accessdate=2013-05-24|isbn=978-0-19-289330-7 |last1=Sen |first1=Amartya }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''earthworm''' is a tube-shaped, segmented [[worm]] found in the phylum [[Annelid]]a. They are commonly found living in soil, feeding on live and dead organic matter. An earthworm's digestive system runs through the length of its body. It conducts respiration through its skin. It has a double transport system composed of [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]] that moves within the fluid-filled [[coelom]] and a simple, closed blood circulatory system. It has a central and a peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system consists of two ganglia above the mouth, one on either side, connected to a nerve cord running back along its length to motor neurons and sensory cells in each segment. Large numbers of chemoreceptors are concentrated near its mouth. Circumferential and longitudinal muscles on the periphery of each segment enable the worm to move. Similar sets of muscles line the gut, and their actions move the digesting food toward the worm's anus.&lt;ref name="Integrated Principles of Zoology"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Cleveland P. Hickman Jr., Larry S. Roberts, Frances M Hickman|title=Integrated Principles of Zoology|year=1984|edition=7th|publisher=Times Mirror/Mosby College Publishing|isbn=978-0-8016-2173-4|page=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earthworms are [[hermaphrodite]]s: each individual carries both male and female sex organs. As invertebrates, they lack either an internal [[skeleton]] or [[exoskeleton]], but maintain their structure with fluid-filled coelom chambers that function as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]].

"Earthworm" is the common name for the largest members of [[Oligochaeta]] (which is either a class or a subclass depending on the author). In classical systems, they were placed in the order Opisthopora, on the basis of the male pores opening posterior to the female pores, though the internal male segments are anterior to the female. Theoretical [[Cladistics|cladistic]] studies have placed them, instead, in the suborder Lumbricina of the order Haplotaxida, but this may again soon change. Folk names for the earthworm include "dew-worm", "rainworm", "night crawler", and "angleworm" (due to its use as [[fishing bait]]).

Larger terrestrial earthworms are also called '''megadriles''' (which translates to "big worms"), as opposed to the microdriles ("small worms") in the semiaquatic families [[Tubificidae]], [[Lumbricidae]], and [[Enchytraeidae]], among others. The megadriles are characterized by having a distinct [[clitellum]] (which is more extensive than that of microdriles) and a vascular system with true capillaries.

Earthworms are far less abundant in disturbed environments and are typically active only if water is present.&lt;ref name="brady"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nyle C. Brady |author2=Ray R. Weil |title =Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils (3rd Edition)|publisher =Prentice Hall|year =2009|page=|isbn =978-0-13-501433-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anatomy ==

=== Form and function ===
[[File:Earthworm head.svg|450px|thumb|Earthworm head]]
Depending on the species, an adult earthworm can be from {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide to {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and over {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide, but the typical ''[[Lumbricus terrestris]]'' grows to about {{convert|360|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.{{sfn|Blakemore|2012|p=xl}} Probably the longest worm on confirmed records is ''[[Amynthas mekongianus]]'' that extends up to 3&amp;nbsp;m (10&amp;nbsp;ft) &lt;ref name ="Blakemore et al., 2007 page 23"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[R.J. Blakemore et al.]] |year=2007 |title=Megascolex (Promegascolex) mekongianus Cognetti, 1922 – its extent, ecology and allocation to Amynthas (Clitellata/Oligochaeta: Megascolecidae) |publisher=Opuscula Zoologica |url=http://opuscula.elte.hu/PDF/Tomus36/3_Blakemore.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mud along the banks of the 4,350&amp;nbsp;km (2,703&amp;nbsp;mi) Mekong River in Southeast Asia.

From front to back, the basic shape of the earthworm is a cylindrical tube, divided into a series of segments (called [[metamerism (biology)|metamerisms]]) that compartmentalize the body. Furrows are generally{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=11}} externally visible on the body demarking the segments; dorsal pores and nephridiopores exude a fluid that moistens and protects the worm's surface, allowing it to breathe. Except for the mouth and anal segments, each segment carries bristle-like hairs called lateral [[seta]]e{{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|pp=3–6}} used to anchor parts of the body during movement;{{sfn|Edwards|Bholen|1996|p=3}} species may have four pairs of setae on each segment or more than eight sometimes forming a complete circle of setae per segment.{{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|pp=3–6}} Special ventral setae are used to anchor mating earthworms by their penetration into the bodies of their mates.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Generally, within a species, the number of segments found is consistent across specimens, and individuals are born with the number of segments they will have throughout their lives. The first body segment (segment number 1) features both the earthworm's mouth, overhanging the mouth, a fleshy lobe called the [[prostomium]] , which seals the entrance when the worm is at rest, but is also used to feel and chemically sense the worm's surroundings. Some species of earthworm can even use the prehensile prostomium to grab and drag items such as grasses and leaves into their burrow.

An adult earthworm develops a belt-like glandular swelling, called the [[clitellum]], which covers several segments toward the front part of the animal. This is part of the reproductive system and produces egg capsules. The [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] is most commonly cylindrical like the rest of the body, but depending on the species, may also be quadrangular, octagonal, trapezoidal, or flattened.  The last segment is called the [[periproct]]; the earthworm's anus, a short vertical slit, is found on this segment.{{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|pp=3–6}}

[[File:Annelid redone w white background.svg|700px|center|A segment of an earthworm posterior to the clitellum including all of the segmental structures]]

The exterior of an individual segment is a thin [[cuticle]] over skin, commonly pigmented red to brown, which has specialized cells that secrete mucus over the cuticle to keep the body moist and ease movement through soil. Under the skin is a layer of nerve tissue, and two layers of muscles—a thin outer layer of circular muscle, and a much thicker inner layer of longitudinal muscle.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=8-9}} Interior to the muscle layer is a fluid-filled chamber called a [[coelom]]{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=1}} that by its pressurization provides structure to the worm's boneless body. The segments are separated from each other by septa (the plural of "septum"){{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|p=8}} which are perforated transverse walls, allowing the coelomic fluid to pass between segments.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=12}}  A pair of structures called [[nephrostome]]s are located at the back of each septum; a nephric tubule leads from each nephrostome through the septum and into the following segment.  This tubule then leads to the main body fluid filtering organ, the [[nephridium]] or metanephridium, which removes metabolic waste from the [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]] and expels it through pores called nephridiopores on the worm's sides; usually two nephridia (sometimes more) are found in most segments.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=6}} At the center of a worm is the [[Alimentary canal|digestive tract]], which runs straight through from mouth to anus without coiling, and is flanked above and below by blood vessels (the dorsal blood vessel and the ventral blood vessel as well as a subneural blood vessel) and the [[ventral nerve cord]], and is surrounded in each segment by a pair of pallial blood vessels that connect the dorsal to the subneural blood vessels.

Many earthworms can eject coelomic fluid through pores in the back in response to stress; Australian ''Didymogaster sylvaticus'' (known as the "blue squirter earthworm") can squirt fluid as high as {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name ="Meet the squirting earthworm"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Myrmecofourmis]] |year=2018 |title=Meet the squirting earthworm |publisher=Youtube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuQEAuM9De8 |format=[[video]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=12}}

=== Nervous system ===
[[File:Earthworm nervous system.png|thumb|280px|Nervous system of the anterior end of an earthworm]]
The nervous system of an earthworm is segmented and comprises three parts: the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), [[peripheral nervous system]] and the [[sympathetic nervous system]].&lt;ref name="HSBE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brain – Invertebrate Brain – Ganglia, Nervous, System, and Head|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/1009/Brain-Invertebrate-brain.html#ixzz3WG2hsy30|publisher=HSBE|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Priy"&gt;{{cite web|author=Priyadarshini, S.|url=http://www.biologydiscussion.com/neural-control/different-parts-of-nervous-system-of-earthworm-with-diagram/5017|title=Different parts of nervous system of earthworm (with diagram)|publisher=Biology Discussion|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Central nervous system ====
The CNS consists of a bilobed [[brain]] (cerebral [[Ganglion|ganglia]], or [[supra-pharyngeal ganglion]]), sub-pharyngeal ganglia, circum-pharyngeal connectives and a [[ventral nerve cord]].

Earthworms' brains consist of a pair of pear-shaped cerebral ganglia.  These are located in the dorsal side of the [[alimentary canal]] in the third segment, in a groove between the [[buccal cavity]] and [[pharynx]].

A pair of circum-pharyngeal connectives from the brain encircle the pharynx and then connect with a pair of sub-pharyngeal ganglia located below the pharynx in the fourth segment. This arrangement means the brain, sub-pharyngeal ganglia and the circum-pharyngeal connectives form a nerve ring around the pharynx.

The ventral nerve cord (formed by nerve cells and nerve fibres) begins at the sub-pharyngeal ganglia and extends below the alimentary canal to the most posterior body segment. The ventral nerve cord has a swelling, or ganglion, in each segment, i.e. a segmental ganglion, which occurs from the fifth to the last segment of the body.  There are also three [[Axons|giant axons]], one medial giant axon (MGA) and two lateral giant axons (LGAs) on the mid-dorsal side of the ventral nerve cord.  The MGA is 0.07&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and transmits in an anterior-posterior direction at a rate of 32.2&amp;nbsp;m/s. The LGAs are slightly wider at 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and transmit in a posterior-anterior direction at 12.6&amp;nbsp;m/s.  The two LGAs are connected at regular intervals along the body and are therefore considered one giant axon.&lt;ref name="expt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://backyardbrains.com/experiments/comparingNerveSpeed#prettyPhoto|title=Experiment: Comparing speeds of two nerve fiber sizes|publisher=BackyardBrains|accessdate=April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drewes"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Giant nerve fibre activity in intact, freely moving earthworms|author=Drewes, C.D., Landa, K.B. and McFall, J.L.|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=72|pages=217–227|year=1978|pmid=624897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Peripheral nervous system ====
*Eight to ten nerves arise from the cerebral ganglia to supply the prostomium, buccal chamber and pharynx.
*Three pairs of nerves arise from the subpharyangeal ganglia to supply the 2nd, 3rd and 4th segment.
*Three pairs of nerves extend from each [[segmental ganglia]] to supply various structures of the segment.

==== Sympathetic nervous system ====
The sympathetic nervous system consists of nerve plexuses in the epidermis and alimentary canal. (A plexus is a web of nerve cells
connected together in a two dimensional grid.)  The nerves that run along the body wall pass between the outer circular and inner longitudinal muscle layers of the wall. They give off branches that form the intermuscular plexus and the subepidermal plexus. These nerves connect with the circumpharyngeal connective.

==== Movement ====
On the surface, crawling speed varies both within and among individuals.  Earthworms crawl faster primarily by taking longer "strides" and a greater frequency of strides.  Larger ''Lumbricus terrestris'' worms crawl at a greater absolute speed than smaller worms.  They achieve this by taking slightly longer strides but with slightly lower stride frequencies.&lt;ref name="Quillin"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kinematic scaling of locomotion by hydrostatic animals: ontogeny of peristaltic crawling by the earthworm lumbricus terrestris|author=Quillin, K.J.|year=1999|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=202|pages=661–674|pmid=10021320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Touching an earthworm, which causes a "pressure" response as well as (often) a response to the dehydrating quality of the salt on human skin (toxic to earthworms), stimulates the subepidermal nerve plexus which connects to the intermuscular plexus and causes the longitudinal muscles to contact, thereby the writhing movements when we pick up an earthworm. This behaviour is a [[reflex]] and does not require the CNS; it occurs even if the nerve cord is removed. Each segment of the earthworm has its own nerve plexus.  The plexus of one segment is not connected directly to that of adjacent segments.  The nerve cord is required to connect the nervous systems of the segments.&lt;ref name="Cronodon"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Cronodon|title=Earthworm-nervous system|url=http://cronodon.com/BioTech/Earthworm_NS.html|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The giant axons carry the fastest signals along the nerve cord.  These are emergency signals that initiate reflex escape behaviours. The larger dorsal giant axon conducts signals the fastest, from the rear to the front of the animal.  If the rear of the worm is touched, a signal is rapidly sent forwards causing the longitudinal muscles in each segment to contract.  This causes the worm to shorten very quickly as an attempt to escape from a predator or other potential threat. The two medial giant axons connect with each other and send signals from the front to the rear.  Stimulation of these causes the earthworm to very quickly retreat (perhaps contracting into its burrow to escape a bird).

The presence of a nervous system is essential for an animal to be able to experience [[nociception]] or [[Pain in invertebrates|pain]]. However, other physiological capacities are also required such as opioid sensitivity and central modulation of responses by analgesics.&lt;ref name="Elwood"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=ILAR Journal|year=2011|volume=52|issue=2|pages=175–84|title=Pain and suffering in invertebrates?|author=
Elwood, R.W.|pmid=21709310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Enkephalin]] and [[α-endorphin]]-like substances have been found in earthworms.  Injections of [[naloxone]] (an opioid antagonist) inhibit the escape responses of earthworms.  This indicates that opioid substances play a role in sensory modulation, similar to that found in many vertebrates.&lt;ref name="ILAR"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://ilarjournal.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/1-2/25.full|journal=ILAR Journal|volume=33|issue=1–2|pages=25–31|title=A question of pain in invertebrates|author=Smith, J.A.|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photosensitivity ===
Earthworms do not have eyes (although some worms do), however, they do have specialised photosensitive cells called "light cells of Hess".  These photoreceptor cells have a central intracellular cavity ([[phaosome]]) filled with [[microvilli]].  As well as the microvilli, there are several sensory [[cilia]] in the phaosome which are structurally independent of the microvilli.&lt;ref name="eyes"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Zeitschrift für Zellforschung und Mikroskopische Anatomie|year=1970|volume=104|issue=3|pages=345–357|title=Fine structure of photoreceptor cells in the earthworm, ''Lumbricus terrestris''|author=Röhlich, P., Aros, B. and Virágh, Sz.|doi=10.1007/BF00335687}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The photoreceptors are distributed in most parts of the epidermis but are more concentrated on the back and sides of the worm.  A relatively small number occur on the ventral surface of the 1st segment. They are most numerous in the prostomium and reduce in density in the first three segments; they are very few in number past the third segment.&lt;ref name="Cronodon" /&gt;

=== Digestive system ===

The [[Alimentary canal|gut]] of the earthworm is a straight tube which extends from the worm's mouth to its anus.  It is differentiated into a buccal cavity (generally running through the first one or two segments of the earthworm), pharynx (running generally about four segments in length), esophagus, crop, gizzard (usually) and intestine.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|p=13}}

Food enters in the mouth. The pharynx acts as a suction pump; its muscular walls draw in food. In the pharynx, the pharyngeal glands secrete mucus. Food moves into the esophagus, where calcium (from the blood and ingested from previous meals) is pumped in to maintain proper blood calcium levels in the blood and food pH. From there the food passes into the crop and gizzard. In the gizzard, strong muscular contractions grind the food with the help of mineral particles ingested along with the food. Once through the gizzard, food continues through the intestine for digestion. The intestine secretes [[Pepsin]] to digest proteins, [[Amylase]] to digest polysaccharides, [[Cellulase]] to digest cellulose, and lipase to digest fats.&lt;ref name="Integrated Principles of Zoology" /&gt; Earthworms use, in addition to the digestive proteins, a class of surface active compounds called [[drilodefensins]], which help digest plant material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unique metabolites protect earthworms against plant polyphenols|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150804/ncomms8869/full/ncomms8869.html|journal = Nature Communications|date = 2015-08-04|pmc = 4532835|pmid = 26241769|pages = 7869|volume = 6|doi = 10.1038/ncomms8869|language = en|first = Manuel|last = Liebeke|first2 = Nicole|last2 = Strittmatter|first3 = Sarah|last3 = Fearn|first4 = A.

The intestine has its own pair of muscle layers like the body, but in reverse order—an inner circular layer within an outer longitudinal layer.{{sfn|Edwards|Bohlen|1996|pp=13–15}}

=== Circulatory system ===

The earthworm has a dual circulatory system in which both the coelomic fluid and a closed circulatory system carry the food, waste, and respiratory gases. The closed circulatory system has five main blood vessels: the dorsal (top) vessel, which runs above the digestive tract; the ventral (bottom) vessel, which runs below the digestive tract; the subneural vessel, which runs below the ventral nerve cord; and two lateroneural vessels on either side of the nerve cord.{{sfn|Sims|Gerard|1985|p=10}} The dorsal vessel moves the blood forward, while the other four longitudinal vessels carry the blood rearward. In segments seven through eleven, a pair of aortic arches rings the coelom and acts as hearts, pumping the blood to the ventral vessel that acts as the aorta. The blood consists of ameboid cells and hemoglobin dissolved in the plasma. The second circulatory system derives from the cells of the digestive system that line the coelom. As the digestive cells become full, they release non-living cells of fat into the fluid-filled coelom, where they float freely but can pass through the walls separating each segment, moving food to other parts and assist in wound healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Cleveland P.

=== Excretory system ===

The excretory system contains a pair of [[nephridia]] in every segment, except for the first three and the last ones.&lt;ref name=Tutorvista&gt;{{cite web|last=Farabee|first=H.J|title=Excretory System|url=http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/biobookexcret.html|accessdate=29 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730161917/http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/BIOBK/BioBookEXCRET.html|archivedate=30 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three types of nephridia are: integumentary, septal, and pharyngeal. The integumentary nephridia lie attached to the inner side of the body wall in all segments except the first two. The septal nephridia are attached to both sides of the septa behind the 15th segment. The pharyngeal nephridia are attached to fourth, fifth and sixth segments.&lt;ref name=Tutorvista /&gt; The waste in the coelom fluid from a forward segment is drawn in by the beating of [[motile cilia|cilia]] of the [[nephrostome]]. From there it is carried through the septum (wall) via a tube which forms a series of loops entwined by blood capillaries that also transfer waste into the tubule of the nephrostome. The excretory wastes are then finally discharged through a pore on the worm's side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Cleveland P. Hickman Jr., Larry S. Roberts, Frances M Hickman|title=Integrated Principles of Zoology|year=1984|edition=7th|publisher=Times Mirror/Mosby College Publishing|isbn=978-0-8016-2173-4|pages=345–346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Respiration ===

Earthworms have no special respiratory organs. Gases are exchanged through the moist skin and capillaries, where the oxygen is picked up by the hemoglobin dissolved in the blood plasma and carbon dioxide is released. Water, as well as salts, can also be moved through the skin by active transport.

== Life and physiology ==
At birth, earthworms emerge small, but fully formed, only lack their sex structures, which develop in about 60 to 90 days. They attain full size in about one year. Scientists predict that the average lifespan under field conditions is four to eight years, while most garden varieties live only one to two years.

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Mating earthworms.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Earthworm copulation&lt;/center&gt;|right]]
[[File:Earthworm - L. terrestris cocoons.jpg|thumb|Earthworm cocoons from ''L. terrestris''|right]]
[[File:Earthworm egg.jpg|thumb|An earthworm cocoon from ''L. rubellus''|right]]

Several common earthworm species are mostly [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]], meaning that growth and development of [[embryos]] happens without [[fertilization]].

Among lumbricid earthworms, parthenogenesis arose from sexual relatives many times.&lt;ref name="pmid25463017"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Domínguez J, Aira M, Breinholt JW, Stojanovic M, James SW, Pérez-Losada M |title=Underground evolution: New roots for the old tree of lumbricid earthworms |journal=Mol.

Mating occurs on the surface, most often at night. Earthworms are [[hermaphrodites]]; that is, they have both male and female sexual organs. The sexual organs are located in segments 9 to 15. Earthworms have one or two pairs of [[testes]] contained within sacs. The two or four pairs of [[seminal vesicles]] produce, store and release the sperm via the male pores. Ovaries and oviducts in segment 13 release eggs via female pores on segment 14, while sperm is expelled from segment 15. One or more pairs of [[spermatheca]]e are present in segments 9 and 10 (depending on the species) which are internal sacs that receive and store sperm from the other worm during copulation. As a result, segment 15 of one worm exudes sperm into segments 9 and 10 with its storage vesicles of its mate. Some species use external [[spermatophore]]s for sperm transfer.

In ''Hormogaster samnitica'' and ''Hormogaster elisae'' [[transcriptome]] DNA libraries were sequenced and two sex [[pheromone]]s, Attractin and Temptin, were detected in all tissue samples of both [[species]].&lt;ref name="pmid23596327"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Novo M, Riesgo A, Fernández-Guerra A, Giribet G |title=Pheromone evolution, reproductive genes, and comparative transcriptomics in mediterranean earthworms (annelida, oligochaeta, hormogastridae) |journal=Mol.

Outcrossing would provide the benefit of masking the expression of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny.&lt;ref name="pmid3324702"&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Bernstein H, Hopf FA, Michod RE |title=The molecular basis of the evolution of sex |journal=Adv.

[[animal sexual behavior|Copulation]] and [[reproduction]] are separate processes in earthworms. The mating pair overlap front ends [[ventral]]ly and each exchanges sperm with the other.  The [[clitellum]] becomes very reddish to pinkish in color.  Some time after copulation, long after the worms have separated, the clitellum (behind the spermathecae) secretes material which forms a ring around the worm. The worm then backs out of the ring, and as it does so, it injects its own eggs and the other worm's sperm into it. As the worm slips out of the ring, the ends of the cocoon seal to form a vaguely onion-shaped incubator ([[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]]) in which the embryonic worms develop.

=== Locomotion ===
[[File:Close up of earthworm.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Close up of an earthworm in garden soil]]
Earthworms travel underground by the means of waves of muscular contractions which alternately shorten and lengthen the body ([[peristalsis]]). The shortened part is anchored to the surrounding soil by tiny claw-like bristles ([[seta]]e) set along its segmented length. In all the body segments except the first, last and clitellum, there is a ring of S-shaped setae embedded in the epidermal pit of each segment (perichaetine). The whole burrowing process is aided by the secretion of lubricating mucus. Worms can make gurgling noises underground when disturbed as a result of their movement through their lubricated tunnels. Earthworms move through soil by expanding crevices with force; when forces are measured according to body weight, hatchlings can push 500 times their own body weight whereas large adults can push only 10 times their own body weight.&lt;ref name="Quillan 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2000|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=203|issue=Pt 18|pages=2757–2770|author=Quillan, K.J.|title=Ontogenetic scaling of burrowing forces in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/203/18/2757.full.pdf+html|accessdate=April 4, 2015|pmid=10952876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regeneration ===
Earthworms have the ability to regenerate lost segments, but this ability varies between species and depends on the extent of the damage. Stephenson (1930) devoted a chapter of his monograph to this topic, while G.E. Gates spent 20 years studying regeneration in a variety of species, but “because little interest was shown”, Gates (1972) only published a few of his findings that, nevertheless, show it is theoretically possible to grow two whole worms from a bisected specimen in certain species.
Gates’s reports included:
*''[[Eisenia fetida]]'' (Savigny, 1826) with head regeneration, in an anterior direction, possible at each intersegmental level back to and including 23/24, while tails were regenerated at any levels behind 20/21, i.e., two worms may grow from one.&lt;ref name=biolbull /&gt;
*''Lumbricus terrestris'' [[Linnaeus]], 1758 replacing anterior segments from as far back as 13/14 and 16/17 but tail regeneration was never found.
*''Perionyx excavatus'' Perrier, 1872 readily regenerated lost parts of the body, in an anterior direction from as far back as 17/18, and in a posterior direction as far forward as 20/21.
*''Lampito mauritii'' Kinberg, 1867 with regeneration in anterior direction at all levels back to 25/26 and tail regeneration from 30/31; head regeneration was sometimes believed to be caused by internal amputation resulting from ''[[Sarcophaga]]'' sp. larval infestation.
*''Criodrilus lacuum'' Hoffmeister, 1845 also has prodigious regenerative capacity with ‘head’ regeneration from as far back as 40/41.&lt;ref name=Hoffmeister /&gt;

An unidentified Tasmanian earthworm shown growing a replacement head has been reported.&lt;ref name=secondhead /&gt;

== Taxonomy and distribution ==
Within the world of taxonomy, the stable 'Classical System' of Michaelsen (1900) and Stephenson (1930) was gradually eroded by the controversy over how to classify earthworms, such that Fender and McKey-Fender (1990) went so far as to say, "The family-level classification of the megascolecid earthworms is in chaos."&lt;ref name=soilbio /&gt;  Over the years, many scientists developed their own classification systems for earthworms, which led to confusion, and these systems have been and still continue to be revised and updated.  The classification system used here, developed by Blakemore (2000), is a modern reversion to the Classical System that is historically proven and widely accepted.&lt;ref name=blakemore2006 /&gt;

Categorization of a megadrile earthworm into one of its taxonomic families under suborders Lumbricina and Moniligastrida is based on such features as the makeup of the clitellum, the location and disposition of the sex features (pores, prostatic glands, etc.), number of gizzards, and body shape.&lt;ref name=blakemore2006 /&gt;  Currently, over 6,000 species of terrestrial earthworms are named, as provided in a species name database,&lt;ref name=ewdatabase /&gt; but the number of synonyms is unknown.

The families, with their known distributions or origins:&lt;ref name=blakemore2006 /&gt;
* [[Acanthodrilidae]] – (Gondwanan or Pangaean?)
* Ailoscolecidae – Pyrenees and southeast USA
* [[Almidae]] – tropical equatorial (South America, Africa, Indo-Asia)
* Benhamiinae – Ethiopian, Neotropical (a possible subfamily of Octochaetidae)
* [[Criodrilidae]] – southwestern Palaearctic: Europe, Middle East, Russia and Siberia to Pacific coast; Japan (Biwadrilus); mainly aquatic
* Diplocardiinae/-idae – Gondwanan or Laurasian? (a subfamily of Acanthodrilidae)
* [[Enchytraeidae]] – cosmopolitan but uncommon in tropics (usually classed with Microdriles)
* [[Eudrilidae]] – Tropical Africa south of the Sahara
* Exxidae – Neotropical: Central America and Caribbean
* [[Glossoscolecidae]] – Neotropical: Central and  South America, Caribbean
* Haplotaxidae – cosmopolitan distribution (usually classed with Microdriles)
* Hormogastridae – Mediterranean
* Kynotidae – Malagasian: Madagascar
* [[Lumbricidae]] – Holarctic: North America, Europe, Middle East, Central Asia to Japan
* Lutodrilidae – Louisiana southeast USA
* [[Megascolecidae]] – (Pangaean?)
* Microchaetidae – Terrestrial in Africa especially South African grasslands
* [[Moniligastridae]] – Oriental and Indian subregion
* Ocnerodrilidae – Neotropics, Africa; India
* Octochaetidae – Australasian, Indian, Oriental, Ethiopian, Neotropical
* Octochaetinae – Australasian, Indian, Oriental (subfamily if Benhamiinae is accepted)
* [[Sparganophilidae]] – Nearctic, Neotropical: North and Central America
* Tumakidae – Colombia, South America

=== As an invasive species ===
{{Main|Earthworms as invasive species|Invasive earthworms of North America}}
From a total of around 7,000 species, only about 150 species are widely distributed around the world. These are the peregrine or cosmopolitan earthworms.&lt;ref name=cosmo3 /&gt;

== Ecology ==
[[File:Earthworm - L. terrestris permanent vertical burrow.jpg|thumb|upright|Permanent vertical burrow]]
Earthworms are classified into three main ecophysiological categories: (1) leaf litter- or compost-dwelling worms that are nonburrowing, live at soil-litter interface and eat decomposing organic matter (called Epigeic) e.g. ''Eisenia fetida''; (2) topsoil- or subsoil-dwelling worms that feed (on soil), burrow and cast within soil, creating horizontal burrows in upper 10–30&amp;nbsp;cm of soil (called Endogeics); and (3) worms that construct permanent deep vertical burrows which they use to visit the surface to obtain plant material for food, such as leaves (called Anecic (meaning "reaching up")), e.g. ''Lumbricus terrestris''.&lt;ref name=ucdavis /&gt;

Earthworm populations depend on both physical and chemical properties of the soil, such as temperature, moisture, pH, salts, aeration, and texture, as well as available food, and the ability of the species to reproduce and disperse. One of the most important environmental factors is [[pH]], but earthworms vary in their preferences. Most favor neutral to slightly acidic soils. ''Lumbricus terrestris'' is still present in a pH of 5.4 and ''[[Dendrobaena octaedra]]'' at a pH of 4.3 and some [[Megascolecidae]] are present in extremely acidic humic soils. Soil pH may also influence the numbers of worms that go into [[diapause]]. The more acidic the soil, the sooner worms go into diapause and the longer they remain in diapause at a pH of 6.4.

Earthworms form the base of many [[food chains]]. They are preyed upon by many species of [[bird]]s (e.g. [[starling]]s, [[Thrush (bird)|thrushes]], [[gull]]s, [[crow]]s, [[European robin]]s and [[American robin]]s), snakes, mammals (e.g. [[bear]]s, [[fox]]es, [[hedgehog]]s, [[pig]]s, [[mole (animal)|moles]]) and invertebrates (e.g. [[ground beetle]]s and other [[beetle]]s, [[snail]]s, [[slug]]s). Earthworms have many internal [[parasite]]s, including [[protozoa]], [[platyhelminthes]], and [[nematode]]s; they can be found in the worms' [[blood]], [[seminal vesicles]], [[coelom]], or [[intestine]], or in their [[Silkworm cocoons|cocoons]].

Nitrogenous fertilizers tend to create [[Soil pH|acidic conditions]], which are fatal to the worms, and dead specimens are often found on the surface following the application of substances such as [[DDT]], [[lime sulphur]], and [[lead arsenate]]. In [[Australia]], changes in farming practices such as the application of [[superphosphate]]s on [[pasture]]s and a switch from [[pastoral farming]] to [[Agronomy|arable farming]] had a devastating effect on populations of the giant [[Gippsland earthworm]], leading to their classification as a [[protected species]].

The addition of organic matter, preferably as a surface mulch, on a regular basis will provide earthworms with their food and nutrient requirements, and will create the optimum conditions of temperature and moisture that will stimulate their activity.

Earthworms work as biological "[[piston]]s" forcing air through the tunnels as they move. Thus earthworm activity aerates and mixes the soil, and is conducive to mineralization of nutrients and their uptake by vegetation. Certain species of earthworm come to the surface and graze on the higher concentrations of organic matter present there, mixing it with the mineral soil. Because a high level of organic matter mixing is associated with soil fertility, an abundance of earthworms is generally considered beneficial by farmers and gardeners.&lt;ref name=dpi&gt;NSW Department of Primary Industries, [http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/agriculture/soils/biology/earthworms How earthworms can help your soil]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aggie&gt;Galveston County Master Gardener Association, [http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/galveston/beneficials/beneficial-38_earthworms.htm Beneficials in the garden: #38 Earthworms]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, as long ago as 1881 [[Charles Darwin]] wrote: "It may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world, as have these lowly organized creatures."&lt;ref name=darwin /&gt;

[[File:Staphylinus.olens.vs.lumbricus.terrestris.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Devil's coach horse beetle]]'' preying on ''Lumbricus'' sp.]]
Also, while, as the name suggests, the main habitat of earthworms is in soil, they are not restricted to this habitat. The brandling worm ''[[Eisenia fetida]]'' lives in decaying plant matter and manure. ''[[Arctiostrotus vancouverensis]]'' from [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Olympic Peninsula]] is generally found in decaying conifer logs. ''[[Aporrectodea limicola]]'', ''[[Sparganophilus]]'' spp.,  and several others are found in mud in streams.  Some species are arboreal, some aquatic and some euryhaline (salt-water tolerant) and littoral (living on the sea-shore, e.g. ''[[Pontodrilus litoralis]]''). Even in the soil species, special habitats, such as soils derived from [[serpentine group|serpentine]], have an earthworm fauna of their own.

=== Environmental benefits ===
The major benefits of earthworm activities to soil fertility for agriculture can be summarized as:
* '''Biological''': In many soils, earthworms play a major role in the conversion of large pieces of organic matter into rich [[humus]], thus improving soil fertility. This is achieved by the worm's actions of pulling below the surface deposited organic matter such as leaf fall or manure, either for food or to plug its burrow. Once in the burrow, the worm will shred the leaf and partially digest it and mingle it with the earth. Worm casts (see bottom right) can contain 40 percent more humus than the top 9" (23&amp;nbsp;cm) of soil in which the worm is living.&lt;ref name="brady" /&gt;
[[File:Earthworm faeces.jpg|thumb|[[Faeces]] in form of casts]]
* '''Chemical''': In addition to dead [[organic matter]], the earthworm also ingests any other soil particles that are small enough—including sand grains up to 1/20 of an inch (1.25&amp;nbsp;mm)—into its gizzard, wherein those minute fragments of grit grind everything into a fine paste which is then digested in the intestine. When the worm excretes this in the form of casts, deposited on the surface or deeper in the soil, minerals and plant nutrients are changed to an accessible form for plants to use. Investigations in the United States show that fresh earthworm casts are five times richer in available [[nitrogen]], seven times richer in available [[phosphate]]s, and 11 times richer in available [[potassium]] than the surrounding upper 6&amp;nbsp;inches (150&amp;nbsp;mm) of soil. In conditions where humus is plentiful, the weight of casts produced may be greater than 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg (10&amp;nbsp;lb) per worm per year&lt;!-- subjective , and is in itself an indicator of why it pays the gardener or farmer to keep worm populations high--&gt;.&lt;ref name="brady" /&gt;
* '''Physical''': The earthworm's burrowing creates a multitude of channels through the soil and is of great value in maintaining the [[soil structure]], enabling processes of aeration and drainage. [[Permaculture]] co-founder [[Bill Mollison]] points out that by sliding in their tunnels, earthworms "act as an innumerable army of pistons pumping air in and out of the soils on a 24-hour cycle (more rapidly at night)".&lt;ref name=Mollison /&gt; Thus, the earthworm not only creates passages for air and water to traverse the soil, but also modifies the vital organic component that makes a soil healthy (see [[Bioturbation]]). Earthworms promote the formation of nutrient-rich casts (globules of soil, stable in soil [mucus]) that have high soil aggregation and soil fertility and quality.&lt;ref name="brady" /&gt;

Earthworms accelerate nutrient cycling in the soil-plant system through  fragmentation &amp; mixing of plant debris – physical grinding &amp; chemical digestion.&lt;ref name="brady" /&gt; The earthworm's existence cannot be taken for granted. Dr. [[W. E. Shewell-Cooper]] observed "tremendous numerical differences between adjacent gardens", and worm populations are affected by a host of environmental factors, many of which can be influenced by good management practices on the part of the gardener or farmer.&lt;ref name=cooper /&gt;

Darwin estimated that [[arable land]] contains up to 53,000 worms per acre (13/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), but more recent research from [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] has produced figures suggesting that even poor soil may support 250,000/acre (62/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), whilst rich fertile farmland may have up to 1,750,000/acre (432/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), meaning that the weight of earthworms beneath a farmer's soil could be greater than that of the livestock upon its surface.

The ability to break down organic materials and excrete concentrated nutrients makes the earthworm a functional contributor in restoration projects. In response to ecosystem disturbances, some opencast mining sites have utilized earthworms to prepare soil for the return of native flora. Sites using this method have observed advances in the return of [[ecosystem services]] that previously took much longer to re-establish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The potential of earthworms to restore ecosystem services after opencast mining – A review|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439179110000101|journal = Basic and Applied Ecology|date = 2010-05-01|pages = 196–203|volume = 11|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.baae.2009.12.005|first = Stephane|last = Boyer|first2 = Stephen D.|last2 = Wratten}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research from the [[Station d'écologie de Lamto|Station d'écologie Tropicale de Lamto]] asserts that the earthworms positively influence the rate of macroaggregate formation, an important feature for soil structure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Restoration by earthworms (megascolecidae) of the macroaggregate structure of a destructured savanna soil under field conditions|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003807179290155Q|journal = Soil Biology and Biochemistry|date = 1992-12-01|pages = 1587–1594|volume = 24|issue = 12|doi = 10.1016/0038-0717(92)90155-Q|first = Eric|last = Blanchart}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stability of aggregates in response to water was also found to be improved when constructed by earthworms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Economic impact ==
[[File:EarthwormChonita01.JPG|thumb|Earthworms being raised at [[La Chonita Hacienda]] in Mexico]]
Various species of worms are used in [[Compost#Vermicompost|vermiculture]], the practice of feeding organic waste to earthworms to decompose food waste. These are usually ''[[Eisenia fetida]]'' (or its close relative ''[[Eisenia andrei]]'') or the Brandling worm, commonly known as the tiger worm or red wiggler. They are distinct from soil-dwelling earthworms.  In the tropics, the African nightcrawler ''[[Eudrilus eugeniae]]'' and the Indian blue ''[[Perionyx excavatus]]'' are used.

Earthworms are sold all over the world; the market is sizable. According to Doug Collicut, "In 1980, 370 million worms were exported from Canada, with a Canadian export value of $13 million and an American retail value of $54 million."

Earthworms are also sold as food for human consumption. [[Noke (worms)|''Noke'']] is a culinary term used by the [[Māori people|Māori]] of [[New Zealand]], and refers to earthworms which are considered delicacies for their chiefs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16056">In [[electrical engineering]], '''electric machine''' is a general term for [[machine]]s using [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]]s, such as [[electric motor]]s, [[electric generator]]s, and others. They are [[electromechanical]] energy converters: an electric motor converts electricity to [[mechanical power]] while an electric generator converts mechanical power to electricity. The moving parts in a machine can be rotating (''rotating machines'') or linear (''linear machines'').  Besides motors and generators, a third category often included is [[transformer]]s, which although they do not have any [[moving parts]] are also energy converters, changing the [[voltage]] level of an [[alternating current]].&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan. Handbook of Transformer Design and Applications, Chap. 1 p1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric machines, in the form of generators, produce virtually all electric power on Earth, and in the form of electric motors consume approximately 60% of all electric power produced. Electric machines were developed beginning in the mid 19th century and since that time have been a ubiquitous component of the  infrastructure. Developing more efficient electric machine technology is crucial to any global conservation, [[green energy]], or [[alternative energy]] strategy.

==Generator==
[[File:ManitobaHydroPointeduBois Generator.jpg|thumb|Electric generator.]]
{{main|Electric generator}}
An electric generator is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. A generator forces [[electrons]] to flow through an external [[electrical circuit]].  It is somewhat analogous to a water pump, which creates a flow of water but does not create the water inside.  The source of mechanical energy, the [[Wiktionary:prime mover|prime mover]], may be a reciprocating or turbine [[steam engine]], water falling through a [[hydropower|turbine or waterwheel]], an [[internal combustion engine]], a [[wind turbine]], a hand [[crank (mechanism)|crank]], [[compressed air]] or any other source of mechanical energy.

The two main parts of an electrical machine can be described in either mechanical or electrical terms. In mechanical terms, the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] is the rotating part, and the [[stator]] is the stationary part of an electrical machine. In electrical terms, the armature is the power-producing component and the field is the magnetic field component of an electrical machine. The armature can be on either the rotor or the stator. The [[magnetic field]] can be provided by either [[electromagnet]]s or [[permanent magnet]]s mounted on either the rotor or the stator. Generators are classified into two types, [[AC generator]]s and [[DC generator]]s.

===AC generator===
An [[AC generator]] converts mechanical energy into [[AC electricity|alternating current electricity]]. Because power transferred into the field circuit is much less than power transferred into the armature circuit, AC generators nearly always have the field winding on the rotor and the armature winding on the stator.

AC generators are classified into several types.
*In an [[induction generator]], the stator magnetic flux induces currents in the rotor. The prime mover then drives the rotor above the synchronous speed, causing the opposing rotor flux to cut the stater coils producing active current in the stater coils, thus sending power back to the electrical grid. An induction generator draws reactive power from the connected system and so cannot be an isolated source of power. 
*In a [[alternator|Synchronous generator (alternator)]], the current for the magnetic field is provided by a separate [[Excitation (magnetic)|DC current source]].

===DC generator===
An electric generator is a machine that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. An electric generator works based on the principle that whenever conductor cuts the magnetic field, an emf is induced which will cause the current to flow if conductor circuit is closed. Take the working of simple loop Generator as an example.

==Motor==
[[File:Silniki by Zureks.jpg|thumb|Electric motor.|236x236px]]
{{main|Electric motor}}
An electric motor converts [[electrical energy]] into [[mechanical energy]]. The reverse process of electrical generators, most [[electric motors]] operate through interacting [[magnetic fields]] and [[electrical conductor|current-carrying conductors]] to generate rotational force. Motors and generators have many similarities and many types of electric motors can be run as generators, and vice versa.
Electric motors are found in applications as diverse as industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, [[power tools]], and [[hard drive|disk drives]]. They may be powered by direct current or by alternating current which leads to the two main classifications: [[AC motor]]s and [[DC motor]]s.

===AC motor===
{{main|AC motor}}
An [[AC motor]] converts alternating current into mechanical energy. It commonly consists of two basic parts, an outside stationary stator having coils supplied with alternating current to produce a rotating magnetic field, and an inside rotor attached to the output shaft that is given a torque by the rotating field.
The two main types of AC motors are distinguished by the type of rotor used.
*[[induction motor|Induction (asynchronous) motor]], the rotor magnetic field is created by an [[electromagnetic induction|induced]] current. The rotor must turn slightly slower (or faster) than the stator magnetic field to provide the induced current. There are three types of induction motor rotors, which are [[squirrel-cage rotor]], [[wound rotor motor|wound rotor]] and [[solid core rotor]].
*[[Synchronous motor]], it does not rely on induction and so can rotate exactly at the supply frequency or sub-multiple. The magnetic field of the rotor is either generated by direct current delivered through slip rings ([[Excitation (magnetic)|exciter]]) or by a permanent magnet.

===DC motor===
{{main|DC motor}}
The [[brushed DC electric motor]] generates torque directly from DC power supplied to the motor by using internal commutation, stationary permanent magnets, and rotating electrical magnets. Brushes and springs carry the electric current from the [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] to the spinning wire windings of the rotor inside the motor. [[Brushless DC motor]]s use a rotating permanent magnet in the rotor, and stationary electrical magnets on the motor housing. A motor controller converts DC to [[alternating current|AC]].  This design is simpler than that of brushed motors because it eliminates the complication of transferring power from outside the motor to the spinning rotor.
An example of a brushless, synchronous DC motor is a [[stepper motor]] which can divide a full rotation into a large number of steps.

==Other electromagnetic machines==
Other electromagnetic machines include the [[Amplidyne]], [[Synchro]], [[Metadyne]], [[Adjustable-speed_drive#Eddy_current_drives|Eddy current clutch]], [[Eddy current brake]], [[Dynamometer#Eddy_current_type_absorber|Eddy current dynamometer]], [[Dynamometer#Hysteresis_dynamometers|Hysteresis dynamometer]], [[Rotary converter]], and [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard set]]. A rotary converter is a combination of machines that act as a mechanical rectifier, inverter or frequency converter. The Ward Leonard set is a combination of machines used to provide speed control. Other machine combinations include the Kraemer and Scherbius systems.

==Transformer==
[[File:Trafostation Alter Hellweg IMGP4722.jpg|thumb|Transformer.]]
{{main|Transformer}}
A transformer is a static device that converts [[alternating current]] from one voltage level to another level (higher or lower), or to the same level, without changing the frequency. A transformer transfers [[electrical energy]] from one [[electrical network|circuit]] to another through [[inductive coupling|inductively coupled]] conductors—the transformer's coils.  A varying [[electric current]] in the first or ''primary'' winding creates a varying [[magnetic flux]] in the transformer's core and thus a varying [[magnetic field]] through the ''secondary'' winding. This varying magnetic field [[electromagnetic induction|induces]] a varying [[electromotive force|electromotive force (EMF)]] or "[[volt]]age" in the secondary winding. This effect is called [[mutual induction]].

There are three types of transformers
# Step-up transformer
# Step-down  transformer
# [[Isolation transformer]]

There are four types of transformers based on structure
# core type
# shell type
# power type
# instrument type

==Electromagnetic-rotor machines==
''Electromagnetic-rotor machines'' are machines having some kind of electric current in the rotor which creates a magnetic field which interacts with the stator windings. The rotor current can be the internal current in a permanent magnet (PM machine), a current supplied to the rotor through brushes (Brushed machine) or a current set up in closed rotor windings by a varying magnetic field (Induction machine).

===Permanent magnet machines===
''PM machines'' have permanent magnets in the rotor which set up a magnetic field. The magnetomotive force in a PM (caused by orbiting electrons with aligned spin) is generally much higher than what is possible in a copper coil. The copper coil can, however, be filled with a ferromagnetic material, which gives the coil much lower [[magnetic reluctance]]. Still the magnetic field created by modern PMs ([[Neodymium magnet]]s) is stronger, which means that PM machines have a better torque/volume and torque/weight ratio than machines with rotor coils under continuous operation. This may change with introduction of superconductors in rotor.

Since the permanent magnets in a PM machine already introduce considerable magnetic reluctance, then the reluctance in the air gap and coils are less important. This gives considerable freedom when designing PM machines.

It is usually possible to overload electric machines for a short time until the current in the coils heats parts of the machine to a temperature which cause damage. PM machines can in less degree be subjected to such overload because too high current in the coils can create a magnetic field strong enough to demagnetise the magnets.

===Brushed machines===
''Brushed machines'' are machines where the rotor coil is supplied with current through brushes in much the same way as current is supplied to the car in an electric [[slot car]] track. More durable brushes can be made of graphite or liquid metal. It is even possible to eliminate the brushes in a "brushed machine" by using a part of rotor and stator as a transformer which transfer current without creating torque. Brushes must not be confused with a commutator. The difference is that the brushes only transfer electric current to a moving rotor while a commutator also provide switching of the current direction.

There is iron (usually [[Transformer#Construction|laminated steel cores]] made of [[sheet metal]]) between the rotor coils and teeth of iron between the stator coils in addition to black iron behind the stator coils. The gap between rotor and stator is also made as small as possible. All this is done to minimize magnetic reluctance of the [[magnetic circuit]] which the magnetic field created by the rotor coils travels through, something which is important for optimizing these machines.

Large brushed machines which are run with DC to the stator windings at synchronous speed are the most common generator in [[power plant]]s, because they also supply [[reactive power]] to the grid, because they can be started by the turbine and because the machine in this system can generate power at constant speed without a controller. This type of machine is often referred to in the literature as a synchronous machine.

This machine can also be run by connecting the stator coils to the grid, and supplying the rotor coils with AC from an inverter. The advantage is that it is possible to control rotating speed of the machine with a fractionally rated inverter. When run this way the machine is known as a [[Doubly fed electric machine#Double fed induction generator|brushed double feed "induction" machine]]. "Induction" is misleading because there is no useful current in the machine which is set up by induction.

===Induction machines===
[[Induction motor|''Induction machines'']] have short circuited rotor coils where a current is set up and maintained by [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]]. This requires that the rotor rotates at other than synchronous speed, so that the rotor coils are subjected to a varying magnetic field created by the stator coils. An induction machine is an asynchronous machine.

Induction eliminates the need for brushes which is usually a weak part in an electric machine. It also allows designs which make it very easy to manufacture the rotor. A metal cylinder will work as rotor, but to improve efficiency a "squirrel cage" rotor or a rotor with closed windings is usually used. The speed of asynchronous induction machines will decrease with increased load because a larger speed difference between stator and rotor is necessary to set up sufficient rotor current and rotor magnetic field. Asynchronous induction machines can be made so they start and run without any means of control if connected to an AC grid, but the starting torque is low.

A special case would be an induction machine with superconductors in the rotor. The current in the superconductors will be set up by induction, but the rotor will run at synchronous speed because there will be no need for a speed difference between the magnetic field in stator and speed of rotor to maintain the rotor current.

Another special case would be the [[Doubly fed electric machine#Brushless doubly fed versions|brushless double fed induction machine]], which has a double set of coils in the stator. Since it has two moving magnetic fields in the stator, it gives no meaning to talk about synchronous or asynchronous speed.

==Reluctance machines==
[[Reluctance motor|''Reluctance machines'']] have no windings in rotor, only a ferromagnetic material shaped so that "electromagnets" in stator can "grab" the teeth in rotor and move it a little. The electromagnets are then turned off, while another set of electromagnets is turned on to move stator further. Another name is step motor, and it is suited for low speed and accurate position control. Reluctance machines can be supplied with PMs in stator to improve performance. The “electromagnet” is then “turned off” by sending a negative current in the coil. When the current is positive the magnet and the current cooperate to create a stronger magnetic field which will improve the reluctance machine’s maximum torque without increasing the currents maximum absolute value.

==Electrostatic machines==
In [[Electrostatic motor|''electrostatic machines'']], torque is created by attraction or repulsion of electric charge in rotor and stator.

[[Electrostatic generator]]s generate electricity by building up electric charge.  Early types were [[friction]] machines, later ones were influence machines that worked by [[electrostatic induction]].  The [[Van de Graaff generator]] is an electrostatic generator still used in research today.

==Homopolar machines==
[[Homopolar motor|''Homopolar machines'']] are true DC machines where current is supplied to a spinning wheel through brushes. The wheel is inserted in a magnetic field, and torque is created as the current travels from the edge to the centre of the wheel through the magnetic field.

==Electric machine systems==
For optimized or practical operation of electric machines, today's electric machine systems are complemented with electronic control.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5004">{{Dormancy}}
'''Delayed implantation''' or '''embryonic diapause''' is a [[Reproduction|reproductive]] strategy used by approximately 100 different [[mammal]]s in seven or eight different [[order (biology)|orders]].  In embryonic diapause, the [[embryo]] ([[blastocyst]]) does not immediately implant in the [[uterus]] after [[sexual reproduction]] has created the [[zygote]], but is maintained in a state of [[dormancy]].  Little to no development takes place while the embryo remains unattached to the uterine wall.  As a result, the normal [[gestation]] period is extended for a species-specific time.&lt;ref name="lope"&gt;

While much of the molecular regulation involved in activating dormant blastocysts has been characterized, little is still known about entry into diapause, and the conditions which enable a blastocyst to remain dormant.

Some mammals that undergo embryonic diapause include [[rodent]]s, [[bear]]s, [[mustelid]]s (e.g. [[weasel]]s and [[badger]]s), and [[marsupial]]s, (e.g. [[kangaroo]]s).  Some groups only have one species that undergoes embryonic diapause, such as the [[roe deer]] in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Artiodactyla]].&lt;ref name="ren" /&gt;

== Purpose ==

Mammals may undergo diapause to avoid the risk to their own lives during unfavourable and/or environmental conditions. 
Mammals use embryonic diapause to time the [[birth]] of their [[offspring]] for favorable [[metabolic]] and/or environmental conditions.  [[Reproduction]] has a large energy cost and it is beneficial to have ideal conditions (e.g. available food, mild weather, previous offspring [[weaned]]) to ensure the [[offspring]] survives before giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;

== Types ==

Two types of mammalian embryonic diapause have been identified.

=== Facultative diapause ===

Facultative diapause is also known as lactational delayed implantation due to its regulation via [[lactation]].  If a female [[copulate]]s while still lactating for a previous litter, the suckling stimulus will cause the embryos to enter into diapause. This is known to occur in some [[rodent]]s, [[insectivore]]s and [[marsupial]]s.&lt;ref name="dan"&gt;

===Obligate diapause ===

Obligate diapause is also known as seasonal delayed implantation and is a mechanism that allows mammals to time the birth of their offspring for favorable environmental conditions.  This mechanism occurs as a regular part of the reproductive cycle in mammals such as [[armadillo]]s, all species of [[pinniped]], many [[mustelid]]s, all [[Ursidae|ursids]], one species of [[fruit bat]], and the [[roe deer]].&lt;ref name="dan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In the [[eurocode]] series of [[European Committee for Standardization|European standards]] (EN) related to [[construction]], '''''Eurocode 7: Geotechnical design''''' (abbreviated '''EN 1997''' or, informally, '''EC 7''') describes how to design [[geotechnical]] [[structure]]s, using the [[limit state design]] philosophy. It is published in two parts; "General rules" and "Ground investigation and testing". It was approved by the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN) on 12 June 2006. Like other [[Eurocode]]s, it became mandatory in member states in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurocodes.co.uk/Content.aspx?ContentId=46 eurocodes.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurocode 7 is intended to:
*be used in conjunction with [[EN 1990]], which establishes the principles and requirements for safety and serviceability, describes the basis of design and verification and gives guidelines for related aspects of structural reliability,
*be applied to the geotechnical aspects of the design of buildings and civil engineering works and it is concerned with the requirements for strength, stability, serviceability and durability of structures.

Eurocode 7 is composed of the following parts

==Part 1: General rules==
EN 1997-1 is intended to be used as a general basis for the geotechnical aspects of the design of buildings and civil engineering works.

===Contents===
* General
* Basis of design
* Geotechnical data
* Supervision of construction, monitoring and maintenance
* Fill, [[dewatering]], ground improvement and reinforcement
* Spread foundations
* [[Deep foundation]] (pile foundations)
* Anchorages
* Retaining structures
* [[Hydraulic failure]]
* Overall stability
* [[wikt:embankment|Embankment]]s

EN 1997-1 is accompanied by Annexes A to J, which provide:
*'''Annex A''' Recommended partial safety factor values; different values of the partial factors may be set by the National annex.
*'''Annexes B to J''' Supplementary informative guidance such as internationally applied calculation methods.

==Part 2: Ground investigation and testing==
EN 1997-2 is intended to be used in conjunction with EN 1997-1 and provides rules supplementary to EN 1997-1 related to, planning and reporting of ground investigations, general requirements for a number of commonly used laboratory and field tests, interpretation and evaluation of test results and derivation of values of  geotechnical parameters and coefficients.

==Part 3: Design assisted by field testing==
There is no longer a Part 3. It was amalgamated into EN 1997-2

[[File:Fall protection allows his men to go home at the end of the day.webm|thumb|A video on the value of fall protection measures]]
'''Fall protection''' is the use of controls designed to protect personnel from [[Falling (accident)|falling]] or in the event they do fall, to stop them without causing severe injury. Typically, fall protection is implemented when working at height, but may be relevant when working near any edge, such as near a pit or hole, or performing work on a steep surface.

There are four generally accepted categories of fall protection: fall elimination, fall prevention, [[fall arrest]] and administrative controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=J. Nigel|title=Introduction to fall protection|date=2011|publisher=[[American Society of Safety Engineers]]|isbn=9781885581587|page=28|edition=4th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the US Department of Labor, falls account for 8% of all work-related trauma injuries leading to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bickrest|first1=Ed|title=Fall Protection: Failure is Not an Option|url=http://ehstoday.com/ppe/fall-protection/falls-remain-occupational-hazard-0309|website=EHS Today|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal statutes, standards and regulations in the United States pertaining to the requirements for employers to provide fall protection are administered by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duty to have fall protection. 1926.501|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10757|website=Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration|publisher=United States Dept. of Labor|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Falls in the workplace ==
Falls from elevations were the fourth leading cause of workplace death from 1980 through 1994, with an average of 540 deaths per year accounting for 10% of all occupational fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2000-116/|title=Worker Deaths by Falls: A Summary of Surveillance Findings and Investigative Case Reports|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|page=xi|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falls are a concern for oil and gas workers, many of whom must work high on a [[derrick]].  A study of falls over the period 2005–2014 found that in 86% of fatal falls studied, fall protection was required by regulation, but it was not used, was used improperly, or the equipment failed.  Many of the fatalities were because, although the workers were wearing harnesses, they neglected to attach them to an anchor point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mason|first=Krystal L.|last2=Retzer|first2=Kyla D.|last3=Hill|first3=Ryan|last4=Lincoln|first4=Jennifer M.|date=2017-01-01|title=Occupational Fatalities Resulting from Falls in the Oil and Gas Extraction Industry, United States, 2005–2014|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6616a2.htm|journal=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]]|language=en-us|volume=66|issue=16|pages=417–421|doi=10.15585/mmwr.mm6616a2|issn=0149-2195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of fall protection ==
In most work-at-height environments, multiple fall protection measures are used concurrently.

=== Fall elimination ===
Fall [[Hazard elimination|elimination]] is often the preferred way of providing fall protection.  This entails finding ways of completing tasks without working at heights.

=== Fall prevention ===
{{main|Fall prevention}}
* Fall guarding is the use of guard rails or other barricades to prevent a person from falling. These barricades are placed near an edge where a fall-hazard can occur, or to surround a weak surface (such as a skylight on a roof) which may break when stepped on.
* Fall restraint is a class of [[personal protective equipment]] to prevent persons who are in a fall hazard area from falling, e.g., fall restraint lanyards. Typically, fall restraint will physically prevent a worker from approaching an edge.

=== Fall arrest ===
{{main article|Fall arrest}}
Fall arrest is the form of fall protection that stops a person who has fallen.

=== Administrative controls ===
[[Administrative controls]] are used along with other measures, but they do not physically prevent a worker from going over an edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fall Protection|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10758|website=United States Department of Labor|publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of administrative controls include placing a safety observer or warning line near an edge, or enforcing a safety policy which trains workers and requires them to adhere to other fall protection measures, or prohibiting any un-restrained worker from approaching an edge.

{{Usul al-fiqh}}
A '''Faqeeh''' (plural ''Fuqahā'', {{lang-ar|[[wikt:فقيه|فقيه]], pl. فقهاء}}) is an ''Islamic jurist'', an expert in [[fiqh]], or [[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]] and [[Islamic Law]].

==Definition==
{{main article|fiqh}}

[[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/207723/fiqh Fiqh] Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; or fiqh is the human understanding of the [[Sharia]] (believed by Muslims to represent divine law as revealed in the [[Quran]] and the ''[[Sunnah]]'' (the teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]))&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Frank E.|title=Islamic Law and the Legal System of Saudí: Studies of Saudi Arabia|date=2000|publisher=Brill|pages=4–5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-PfDuvnHMGoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=vogel+islamic+law#v=onepage&amp;q=vogel%20islamic%20law&amp;f=false|isbn=9004110623}}&lt;/ref&gt; —sharia expanded and developed by interpretation (''[[ijtihad]]'') of the Quran and ''Sunnah'' by Islamic jurists (''[[Ulema]]'')&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt; and implemented by the rulings (''[[Fatwa]]'') of jurists on questions presented to them.

''Fiqh'' deals with the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam. In the modern era there are four prominent schools (''[[madh'hab]]'') of ''fiqh'' within [[Sunni]] practice and two (or three) within [[Shi'a]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;Glasse, Cyril, ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', Altamira, 2001, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] describes ''fiqh'' as "knowledge of the rules of God which concern the actions of persons who own themselves bound to obey the law respecting what is required (''[[wajib]]''), sinful (''[[haraam]]''), recommended (''[[mustahab|mandūb]]''), disapproved (''[[makrūh]]'') or neutral (''[[mubah]]'')".&lt;ref&gt;Levy (1957). Page 150.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is consistent amongst the jurists.

Another definition of ''Fiqh'' is "Knowledge of legislative rulings, pertaining to the actions of man, as derived from their detailed evidences."&lt;ref name=Kulseth-440&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kulseth|first1=P. M.|title=Redeemed: The Saga of Eyja's Family in Iceland and the Muslim World|date=2010|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|page=440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PqkZp1ElMmcC&amp;pg=PA440&amp;dq=fiqh+Knowledge+of+legislative+rulings,+pertaining+to+the+actions+of+man,+as+derived+from+their+detailed+evidences&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIiP3lg9XqxwIVTwWSCh21vwQf#v=onepage&amp;q=fiqh%20Knowledge%20of%20legislative%20rulings%2C%20pertaining%20to%20the%20actions%20of%20man%2C%20as%20derived%20from%20their%20detailed%20evidences&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

*"Legislative rulings..." here excludes rulings that are purely theoretical in nature, such as those found in the science of ''Usul Al Fiqh'', as well as those theological in nature, generally discussed in the books of [[Aqidah]] or [[Kalam]].
*"derived from their detailed evidences" here connotes two things:
#that there is a method of derivation; and,
#that the source for such derivation are the various evidences considered valid Islamically.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Methods of derivation==
Methods of derivation are laid out in the books of ''Usul Al Fiqh'' (principles of fiqh), and those evidences which are deemed valid for deriving rulings from are many in number. Four of them are agreed upon by the vast Majority of Jurists, they are:
* The [[Qur'an]]
* The [[Hadith|Sunnah]]
* [[Ijma']] or Consensus
* [[Qiyas]] or Analogy

These four types of evidence are seen as acceptable by the vast majority of Jurists from both the schools of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Jurists (the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Hanbali]] and sometimes the [[Zahiriyah]]), as well as [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] Jurists.  However, [[Zahiriyah]] or Literalists do not see [[Qiyas]] as valid.

While Twelver Shia see edicts of the [[Twelvers|Twelve]] Imams as holding the same weight as the Quran and Sunnah, this is unacceptable by Sunni Jurists.

==Conditions for being a Faqeeh==
The Faqeeh is one who has fulfilled the conditions for [[Ijtihad]] either in their entirety or in piecemeal.  In the Sunni point of view it is generally held that there are either no (or very few) Jurists or Fuqaha that have reached the level of Mujtahid Mutlaq in our day and age. In the [[Twelver]] (Ithna Asheri) Shia view, each of their [[Marja']] have reached this level.

The Faqeeh who fulfills all conditions of Ijtihad is sometimes referred to as a ''Mujtahid Mutlaq'' or Unrestricted Jurist-Scholar, while he who has not reached that level generally will master of the methodology (''Usul'') used by one or more of the prominent ''madhhab'' and then able to apply this methodology to arrive at the traditional legal rulings of his/her respective madhhab. According to the Sunni Muslim website Living Islam, "There is no mujtahid mutlaq today nor even a claimant to that title."&lt;ref name=Haddad&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haddad|first1=GF|title=What is the definition of a mujtahid mutlaq, and are there any today.|url=http://www.livingislam.org/fiqhi/fiqha_e60.html|website=livingislam.org|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the level of Mujtahid Mutlaq is the ''Mujtahid Muqayyad'' or a Restricted Jurist-Scholar.  A ''Mujtahid Muqayyad'' must pass rulings according to the confines of his particular [[madhhab]] (school of jurisprudence), or particular area of specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sunni Path|publisher=Hakikat Kitapevi.|page=33|edition=15th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0RsuasOoNH0C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%27%27%27Mujtahid+Muqayyad%27%27%27&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI2Jr359nqxwIV0X-SCh3DFwEP#v=onepage&amp;q=%27%27%27Mujtahid%20Muqayyad%27%27%27&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is according to the view that Ijtihad or the ability of legal deduction can be achieved in specified areas, and does not require a holistic grasp of the [[Shariah]] and its entailing Laws and legal theory.

'''General Internet Corpus of Russian (GICR)''' is a corpus of Russian internet texts that has been accessible on request through an online query interface since 2013. The corpus includes rich text materials from the blogosphere, social networks, major news sources and literary magazines.

== Goals of the project ==

The project has the status of an educational and scientific one, and many tasks of computational linguistics are solved by independent researchers and research groups with the materials obtained by GICR. 
While other corpus projects of Russian are focused on fiction and edited texts, General Internet Corpus provides linguists timely opportunity to learn the language as it is, with all the slang and regional peculiarities.

Corpus gives the opportunity to carry out research in
* Linguistic research of a wide range: dialectological research, study of word distribution, study of the language of the social networks, study of the influence of gender, age and other factors on the language, frequency of words, fixed expressions and different constructions, stylistic features of texts of different segments of the Internet, etc.
* Social media analysis 
* Corpus-based machine learning for evaluating automatic tagging&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dialog-21.ru/digests/dialog2015/materials/pdf/LagutinMBetal.pdf Automatic Classification of Web Texts Using Functional Text Dimensions]&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times, student papers and independent researches were carried out on the project material by students, graduates and employees of MSU, MIPT, Russian State Humanitarian University, Novosibirsk State University, Higher School of Economics, Russian Academy of Sciences, SFU, CSU, SGMP, IAAS of MSU.

Scientific project leaders:
*Belikov V. - RSUH, Moscow, Russia
*Selegey V. - RSUH, ABBYY, Moscow, Russia
*Sharoff S. - RSUH, Moscow, Russia; University of Leeds, UK&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webcorpora.ru/en/collective&lt;/ref&gt;

The organizations involved in support of GICR: 
* [[Russian State University of Humanities]]
* [[ABBYY|ABBYY Company]]
* [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]]
* [[Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology]]

== Size and content of the corpus ==

Corpus size for the summer 2016 is 19.8 billion tokens, of which 49% are from [[VKontakte]], 40% are from [[LiveJournal]], another 4% - from [[Mail.ru]] Blogs and News, and 2% - from [http://magazines.russ.ru/ Russian Magazine Hall].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webcorpora.ru/%D0%BE-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%81%D0%B5&lt;/ref&gt;
The sources collected in news segment are: [[RIA Novosti]], [[REGNUM News Agency|Regnum]], [[Lenta.ru]], [http://www.rosbalt.ru/ Rosbalt].
Texts are provided with metamarkup (by date of creation of the text, sex, place and year of birth of the author, Internet genre, etc.); all texts are provided with automatic morphological tagging and lemmatization.&lt;ref&gt;://www.webcorpora.ru/%D0%BE-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%81%D0%B5&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the texts collected are of 2013–2014 years of creation, although in some segments, such as in Russian Magazine Hall, there are some texts collected since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Post in the blog: https://vk.com/wall-89094852_220&lt;/ref&gt;

GSFC is the largest combined organization of scientists and engineers in the United States dedicated to increasing knowledge of the [[Earth]], the [[Solar System]], and the [[Universe]] via observations from space. GSFC is a major US laboratory for developing and operating unmanned scientific spacecraft. GSFC conducts scientific investigation, development and operation of space systems, and development of related technologies. Goddard scientists can develop and support a mission, and Goddard engineers and technicians can design and  build the spacecraft for that mission. Goddard scientist [[John C. Mather]] shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]].

GSFC also operates two spaceflight tracking and data acquisition networks (the [[Space Network]] and the [[Near Earth Network]]), develops and maintains advanced space and Earth science data information systems, and develops satellite systems for the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).

GSFC manages operations for many NASA and international missions including the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST), the [[Explorers Program]], the [[Discovery Program]], the [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS), ''[[INTEGRAL]]'', [[MAVEN]], [[OSIRIS-REx]], the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (''SOHO''), the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (''SDO''), and ''[[Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory|Swift]]''. Past missions managed by GSFC include the [[Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer]] (''RXTE''), [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]], ''[[Solar Maximum Mission|SMM]]'', ''[[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]]'', ''[[International Ultraviolet Explorer|IUE]]'', and ''[[ROSAT]]''. Typically, unmanned earth observation missions and observatories in Earth orbit are managed by GSFC,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} while unmanned planetary missions are managed by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) in [[Pasadena, California]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

== History ==
[[File:Goddard-50.PNG|right|thumb|200px|Goddard 50th anniversary logo]]
{{Main|History of Goddard Space Flight Center}}

Goddard is NASA's first, and oldest, [[space center]]. Its original charter was to perform five major functions on behalf of NASA: technology development and fabrication, planning, [[scientific research]], technical operations, and project management. The center is organized into several [[:wikt:directorate|directorate]]s, each charged with one of these key functions.

Until May 1, 1959, NASA's presence in Greenbelt, Maryland was known as the Beltsville Space Center. It was then renamed the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), after [[Robert H. Goddard|Dr. Robert H. Goddard]]. Its first 157 employees transferred from the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Project Vanguard]] missile program, but continued their work at the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] in Washington, D.C., while the center was under construction.

Goddard Space Flight Center contributed to [[Project Mercury]], America's first [[manned space flight]] program. The Center assumed a lead role for the project in its early days and managed the first 250 employees involved in the effort, who were stationed at [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]]. However, the size and scope of Project Mercury soon prompted NASA to build a new Manned Spacecraft Center, now the [[Johnson Space Center]], in [[Houston]], Texas. Project Mercury's personnel and activities were transferred there in 1961.

[[File:GoddardNetwork.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Goddard network ([[STDN]]) tracked many early manned and unmanned spacecraft.]]
Goddard Space Flight Center remained involved in the manned space flight program, providing computer support and radar tracking of flights through a worldwide network of [[ground station]]s called the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] (STDN). However, the Center focused primarily on designing unmanned [[satellite]]s and [[spacecraft]] for scientific research missions. Goddard pioneered several fields of spacecraft development, including [[modular design|modular]] spacecraft design, which reduced costs and made it possible to [[repair]] satellites in orbit. Goddard's [[Solar Maximum Mission|Solar Max]] satellite, launched in 1980, was repaired by astronauts on the [[Space Shuttle Challenger]] in 1984. The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, remains in service and continues to grow in capability thanks to its modular design and multiple servicing missions by the Space Shuttle.

Today, the center remains involved in each of NASA's key programs. Goddard has developed more instruments for [[planetary exploration]] than any other organization, among them scientific instruments sent to every planet in the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/code695/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321012041/http://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/code695/ |archivedate=2009-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center's contribution to the [[Earth Science Enterprise]] includes several spacecraft in the [[Earth Observing System]] fleet as well as [[EOSDIS]], a science data collection, processing, and distribution system. For the manned space flight program, Goddard develops tools for use by astronauts during [[extra-vehicular activity]], and operates the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]], a spacecraft designed to study the Moon in preparation for future [[Exploration of the Moon|manned exploration]].

== Facilities ==
Goddard's partly wooded campus is a few miles northeast of Washington, D.C. in [[Prince George's County]]. The center is on Greenbelt Road, which is [[Maryland Route 193]]. Baltimore, Annapolis, and [[NASA Headquarters]] in Washington are 30–45 minutes away by highway. Greenbelt also has a train station with access to the [[Washington Metro]] system and the [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter train's Camden line.

=== Testing chambers ===
The High Bay Cleanroom located in building 29 is the world's largest [[Cleanroom#Cleanroom classifications|ISO 7]] [[cleanroom]] with 1.3 million cubic feet of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Cleanroom: Hubbles Last Stop|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/servicing/series/cleanroom.html|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vacuum chambers in adjacent buildings 10 and 7 can be chilled or heated to +/- {{convert|200|°C|°F}}.  Adjacent building 15 houses the High Capacity Centrifuge which is capable of generating 30 G on up to a 2.5 tons load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goddard Testing Chambers|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2008/testing_chambers.html|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Parsons Corporation]] assisted in the construction of the Class 10,000 cleanroom to support Hubble Space Telescope as well as other Goddard missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.parsons.com/project/nasa-space-flight-center/|title=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center - Greenbelt, MD - Parsons|work=Parsons|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center ===
The '''High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center''' (HEASARC) is [[NASA]]'s designated center for the archiving and dissemination of high energy astronomy data and information. Information on X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy and related NASA mission archives are maintained for public information and science access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/|title=HEASARC: NASA's Archive of Data on Energetic Phenomena|work=nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software Assurance Technology Center ===
The '''Software Assurance Technology Center''' (SATC) is a NASA department founded in 1992 as part of their Systems Reliability and Safety Office at Goddard Space Flight Center. Its purpose was "to become a center of excellence in software assurance, dedicated to making measurable improvement in both the quality and reliability of software developed for NASA at GSFC". The Center has been the source of research papers on software metrics, assurance, and risk management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://satc.gsfc.nasa.gov/|title=SATC at NASA|website=Satc.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=11 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511165506/http://satc.gsfc.nasa.gov/|archivedate=11 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goddard Visitor Center ===

[[File:Goddard delta.JPG|thumb|right|[[Delta (rocket family)|Delta]] rocket on display in the rocket garden]]

The Goddard Visitor Center is open to the public Tuesdays through Sundays, free of charge, and features displays of spacecraft and technologies developed there.  The Hubble Space Telescope is represented by models and deep space imagery from recent missions. The center also features a [[Science On a Sphere]] projection system.

The center also features an Educator's Resource Center available for use by teachers and education volunteers such as Boy and Girl Scout leaders; and hosts special events during the year.  As an example, in September 2008 the Center opened its gates for Goddard LaunchFest (see [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/events/launchfest.html Goddard LaunchFest Site]).  The event, free to the public, included; robot competitions, tours of Goddard facilities hosted by NASA employees, and live entertainment on the Goddard grounds.

=== External facilities ===
GSFC operates three facilities that are not located at the Greenbelt site. These facilities are:
*The '''[[Wallops Flight Facility]]''' located in [[Wallops Island]], [[Virginia]] was established in 1945, and is one of the oldest launch sites in the world. Wallops manages NASA's [[sounding rocket]] program, and supports approximately 35 missions each year.
*The '''[[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]]''' (GISS) located at [[Columbia University]] in New York City, where much of the Center's theoretical research is conducted. Operated in close association with Columbia and other area universities, the institute provides support research in geophysics, astrophysics, astronomy and meteorology.
*The '''[[Independent Verification and Validation Facility]]''' (IV&amp;V) in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]] was established in 1993 to improve the safety, reliability, and quality of software used in NASA missions.

GSFC is also responsible for the [[White Sands Complex]], a set of two sites in [[Las Cruces, NM]], but the site is owned by [[Johnson Space Center]] as part of the [[White Sands Test Facility]].

== Employees ==
{{See also|History of the Goddard Space Flight Center#People}}
Goddard Space Flight Center has a workforce of over 3,000 civil servant employees, 60% of whom are engineers and scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/about/goddard_info.html |title=NASA - Goddard Information |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2009-02-03 |quote=NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is located within the City of Greenbelt, Maryland, approximately 6.5 miles northeast of Washington, D. C. The suburban campus is situated approximately 1 mile northeast of the Capital Beltway/Interstate 495. |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 7,000 supporting contractors on site every day. It is one of the largest concentrations of the world's premier [[space science|space scientists]] and engineers. The Center is organized into 8 directorates, which includes Applied Engineering and Technology, Flight Projects, Science and Exploration, and Safety &amp; Mission Assurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/about/org2.html |title=NASA - Goddard's Organizations and Projects |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2009-05-19 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[cooperative education|Co-op students]] from universities in all 50 States can be found around the campus every season through the Cooperative Education Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/education/index.html |title=NASA - Goddard Education Resources |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summers, programs such as the Summer Institute in Engineering and Computer Applications (SIECA) and Excellence through Challenging Exploration and Leadership (EXCEL) provide internship opportunities to students from the US and territories such as [[Puerto Rico]] to learn and partake in challenging scientific and engineering work.

== Missions ==
[[File:James Webb Space Telescope Revealed (26764527611).jpg|thumb|James Webb Space Telescope mirrors assembled, May 2016]]
A fact sheet highlighting many of Goddard's previous missions are recorded on a 40th anniversary webpage &lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/pdf/106025main_40th.pdf |title=NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center The First Forty Years |publisher=NASA |date=April 1999 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Past ===
Goddard has been involved in designing, building, and operating spacecraft since the days of [[Explorer 1]], the nation's first artificial satellite. The list of these missions reflects a diverse set of scientific objectives and goals. The [[Landsat]] series of spacecraft has been studying the Earth's resources since the launch of the first mission in 1972. [[Television Infrared Observation Satellite|TIROS-1]] launched in 1960 as the first success in a long series of [[weather satellite]]s. The Spartan platform deployed from the space shuttle, allowing simple, low-cost 2-3 day missions. The second of NASA's [[Great Observatories]], the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]], operated for nine years before re-entering the Earth's atmosphere in 2000. Another of Goddard's space science observatories, the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]], provided unique scientific data about the early universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/missions/past.html] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Present ===
Goddard currently supports the operation of dozens of spacecraft collecting scientific data. These missions include earth science projects like the [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS) that includes the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]], [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]], and [[Aura (satellite)|Aura]] spacecraft flying alongside several projects from other Centers or other countries. Other major Earth science projects that are currently operating include the [[Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission]] (TRMM) and the [[Global Precipitation Measurement]] mission (GPM), missions that provide data critical to hurricane predictions. Many Goddard projects support other organizations, such as the US Geological Survey on Landsat-7 and -8, and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) on the [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite]] (GOES) system that provide weather predictions.

Other Goddard missions support a variety of space science disciplines. Goddard's most famous project is the Hubble Space Telescope, a unique science platform that has been breaking new ground in astronomy for nearly 20 years. Other missions such as the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) study the structure and evolution of the universe. Other missions such as the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) are currently studying the Sun and how its behavior affects life on the Earth. The [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (LRO) is mapping out the composition and topography of the moon and the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (SDO) is tracking the sun's energy and influence on the Earth.

=== Future ===
The Goddard community continually works on numerous operations and projects that have launch dates ranging from the upcoming year to a decade down the road. These operations also vary in what scientists hope they will uncover.

Particularly noteworthy operations include: the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] which will try to study the history of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/future/index.html|title=NASA Missions|first=Jim|last=Wilson|date=11 June 2013|website=Nasa.gov|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science ==
[[File:NASA Goddard's Innovation.ogv|thumb|In this video, two Goddard technologists explain what innovation means and why it is so important to NASA]]

'''Addressing Scientific Questions'''

NASA's missions (and therefore Goddard's missions) address a broad range of scientific questions generally classified around four key areas: Earth sciences, astrophysics, heliophysics, and the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nasascience.nasa.gov/|title=Science Mission Directorate - Science|website=nasascience.nasa.gov|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To simplify, Goddard studies Earth and Space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nasascience.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117171543/http://nasascience.nasa.gov/about-us/science-strategy |archivedate=2009-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Earth sciences area, Goddard plays a major role in research to advance our understanding of the Earth as an environmental system, looking at questions related to how the components of that environmental system have developed, how they interact and how they evolve.  This is all important to enable scientists to understand the practical impacts of natural and human activities during the coming decades and centuries.

Within Space Sciences, Goddard has distinguished itself with the 2006 Nobel Physics Prize given to John Mather and the COBE mission.  Beyond the COBE mission, Goddard studies how the universe formed, what it is made of, how its components interact, and how it evolves. The Center also contributes to research seeking to understand how stars and planetary systems form and evolve and studies the nature of the Sun's interaction with its surroundings.

'''From Scientific Questions to Science Missions'''

Based on existing knowledge accumulated through previous missions, new science questions are articulated.  Missions are developed in the same way an experiment would be developed using the scientific method.  In this context, Goddard does not work as an independent entity but rather as one of the 10 NASA centers working together to find answers to these scientific questions.

Each mission starts with a set of scientific questions to be answered, a set of scientific requirements for the mission, which build on what has already been discovered by prior missions.  Scientific requirements spell out the types data that will need to be collected.  These scientific requirements are then transformed into mission concepts that start to specify the kind of [[spacecraft]] and scientific instruments need to be developed for these scientific questions to be answered.

Within Goddard, the Sciences and Exploration Directorate (SED) leads the center's scientific endeavors, including the development of technology related to scientific pursuits.

'''Collecting Data in Space  – Scientific Instruments'''

Some of the most important technological advances developed by Goddard (and NASA in general) come from the need to innovate with new scientific instruments in order to be able to observe or measure phenomena in space that have never been measured or observed before.  Instrument names tend to be known by their initials.  In some cases, the mission's name gives an indication of the type of instrument involved.  For example, the James Webb Space Telescope is, as its name indicates, a telescope, but it includes a suite of four distinct scientific instruments: [[MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument)|Mid-Infrared Instrument]] (MIRI); [[Near-Infrared Camera]] (NIRCam); [[NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph)|Near-Infrared Spectrograph]] (NIRSpec); [[Fine Guidance Sensor and Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph]] (FGS-NIRISS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/instruments.html|title=Instruments JWST/NASA|website=Jwst.nasa.gov|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists at Goddard work closely with the engineers to develop these instruments.

Typically, a mission consists of a spacecraft with an instrument suite (multiple instruments) on board.  In some cases, the scientific requirements dictate the need for multiple spacecraft. For example, the [[Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission]] (MMS) studies magnetic reconnection, a 3-D process. In order to capture data about this complex 3-D process, a set of four spacecraft fly in a tetrahedral formation.  Each of the four spacecraft carries identical instrument suites. MMS is part of a larger program (Solar Terrestrial Probes) that studies the impact of the sun on the solar system.

'''Goddard's Scientific Collaborations'''

In many cases, Goddard works with partners (US Government agencies, aerospace industry, university-based research centers, other countries) that are responsible for developing the scientific instruments.  In other cases, Goddard develops one or more of the instruments.  The individual instruments are then integrated into an instrument suite which is then integrated with the spacecraft.  In the case of MMS, for example, [[Southwest Research Institute]] (SwRI) was responsible for developing the scientific instruments and Goddard provides overall project management, mission systems engineering, the spacecraft, and mission operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swri.org/9what/releases/2007/MMS_brochure%5B1%5D%5B2%5D.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224205703/http://www.swri.org/9what/releases/2007/MMS_brochure%5B1%5D%5B2%5D.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (LRO), six instruments have been developed by a range of partners.  One of the instruments, the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), was developed by Goddard.  LOLA measures landing site slopes and lunar surface roughness in order to generate a 3-D map of the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/lola.html|title=LOLA Products|website=Lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another mission to be managed by Goddard is [[MAVEN]]. MAVEN is the second mission within the [[Mars Scout Program]] that is exploring the atmosphere of Mars in support of NASA's broader efforts to go to Mars.  MAVEN carries eight instruments to measure characteristics of Mars' atmospheric gases, upper atmosphere, [[solar wind]], and [[ionosphere]].  Instrument development partners include the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Goddard contributed overall project management as well as two of the instruments, two magnetometers.

'''Managing Scientific Data'''

Once a mission is launched and reaches its destination, its instruments start collecting data.  The data is transmitted back to earth where it needs to be analyzed and stored for future reference.  Goddard manages large collections of scientific data resulting from past and ongoing missions.

The Earth Science Division hosts the Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Division (GES DISC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/|title=GES DISC|website=daac.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers Earth science data, information, and services to research scientists, applications scientists, applications users, and students.

The [[National Space Science Data Center]] (NSSDC), created at Goddard in 1966, hosts a permanent archive of space science data, including a large collection of images from space.

== Spinoff technologies ==
Section 102(d) of the [[National Aeronautics and Space Act]] of 1958 calls for "the establishment of long-range studies of the potential benefits to be gained from, the opportunities for, and the problems involved in the utilization of aeronautical and space activities for peaceful and scientific purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/spaceact-legishistory.pdf|format=PDF|title=National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, As Amended|website=History.nasa.gov|accessdate=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this mandate, the Technology Utilization Program was established in 1962 which required [[technology|technologies]] to be brought down to Earth and [[commercialization|commercialized]] in order to help the US economy and improve the quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff2002/spin02.pdf|title=Technology Transfer|first=Loura|last=Hall|date=15 September 2016|website=Sti.nasa.gov|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentation of these technologies that were spun off started in 1976 with "Spinoff 1976".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinhist.html|title=Technology Transfer|first=Loura|last=Hall|date=15 September 2016|website=Sti.nasa.gov|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, NASA has produced a yearly publication of these "spinoff technologies" through the Innovative Partnerships Program Office.

Goddard Space Flight Center has made significant contributions to the US economy and quality of life with the technologies it has spun off. Here are some examples: [[Weather balloon]] technology has helped firefighters with its short-range radios; aluminized [[Mylar]] in satellites has made sports equipment more insulated; laser optics systems have transformed the camera industry and life detection missions on other planets help scientists find bacteria in contaminated food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/spinoff/spinsearch?BOOL=AND&amp;ALLFIELDS=&amp;CENTER=Goddard+Space+Flight+Center&amp;BOOLM=AND&amp;MANUFACT=&amp;STATE=&amp;CATEGORY=&amp;ISSUE=&amp;Spinsort=ISSUED |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905050430/http://www.sti.nasa.gov/spinoff/spinsearch?BOOL=AND&amp;ALLFIELDS=&amp;CENTER=Goddard+Space+Flight+Center&amp;BOOLM=AND&amp;MANUFACT=&amp;STATE=&amp;CATEGORY=&amp;ISSUE=&amp;Spinsort=ISSUED |archivedate=2009-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community ==
The Goddard Space Flight Center maintains ties with local area communities through external volunteer and educational programs.  Employees are encouraged to take part in mentoring programs and take on speaking roles at area schools.  On Center, Goddard hosts regular colloquiums in engineering, leadership and science.  These events are open to the general public, but attendees must sign up in advance to procure a visitors pass for access to the Center's main grounds.  Passes can be obtained at the security office main gate on Greenbelt Road.

Goddard also hosts several different internship opportunities, including NASA DEVELOP at Goddard Space Flight Center.

== Queen Elizabeth II's visit ==
[[Queen regnant|Queen]] [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] and her husband [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] visited Goddard Space Flight Center on Tuesday, May 8, 2007. The tour of Goddard was near the end of the queen's visit to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the founding of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in Virginia. The queen spoke with crew aboard the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/queen.html NASA Press Release on Queen Elizabeth II Visit Goddard, May 8, 2007] - Note: The visit followed a signing on April 19 of a statement of intent between NASA and the [[British National Space Centre]], London, that confirmed a mutual desire for discussions on specific areas of potential collaboration involving lunar science and exploration.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4988">'''Heisler charts''' are a graphical analysis tool for the evaluation of [[heat transfer]] in thermal engineering. They are a set of two charts per included geometry introduced in 1947 by M. P. Heisler&lt;ref&gt;Transactions ASME, 69, 227-236, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; which were supplemented by a third chart per geometry in 1961 by H. Gröber.  Heisler charts permit evaluation of the central temperature for transient [[heat conduction]] through an infinitely long plane wall of thickness 2&lt;var&gt;L&lt;/var&gt;, an infinitely long cylinder of radius r&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, and a sphere of radius r&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. 

Although Heisler-Gröber charts are a faster and simpler alternative to the exact solutions of these problems, there are some limitations.  First, the body must be at uniform temperature initially. Additionally, the temperature of the surroundings and the convective [[heat transfer coefficient]] must remain constant and uniform. Also, there must be no heat generation from the body itself.&lt;ref name ="Cengel"&gt;Cengel, Yunus A. (2007). Heat and Mass Transfer: A Practical Approach (3rd edition ed.). McGraw Hill. pp. 231-236. {{ISBN|978-0-07-312930-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/erlaurito/unsteady-state-basics-presentation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/17462198/Heat-conduction-in-cylinder&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infinitely long plane wall==
These first Heisler-Gröber charts were based upon the first term of the exact [[Fourier Series]] solution for an infinite plane wall:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{T(x,t)-T_\infty}{T_i-T_\infty}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\left[\frac{4\sin{\lambda_n}}{2\lambda_n+\sin{2\lambda_n}}e^{-\lambda_n^2\frac{\alpha t}{L^2}}\cos{ \frac{\lambda_n x}{L}}\right]}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=Cengel/&gt;

where &lt;var&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt; is the initial temperature of the slab, ''T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the constant temperature imposed at the boundary, ''x'' is the location in the plane wall, ''λ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''π(n+1/2)'', and ''α'' is [[thermal diffusivity]]. The position ''x''=0 represents the center of the slab.

The first chart for the plane wall is plotted using 3 different variables. Plotted along the vertical axis of the chart is dimensionless temperature at the midplane, &lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;= \frac{T(0,t)-T_\infty}{T_i-T_\infty}&lt;/math&gt;  . Plotted along the horizontal axis is the [[Fourier Number]], ''Fo=αt/L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' .  The curves within the graph are a selection of values for the inverse of the [[Biot Number]], where "''Bi = hL/k''.  ''k'' is the thermal conductivity of the material and ''h'' is the heat transfer coefficient."&lt;ref name=Cengel/&gt;

&lt;ref name ="Lee"&gt;Lee Ho Sung, http://www.mae.wmich.edu/faculty/Lee/me431/ch05_supp_heisler.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The second chart is used to determine the variation of temperature within the plane wall for different Biot Numbers. The vertical axis is the ratio of a given temperature to that at the centerline ''&lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt;/&lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;math&gt;= \frac{T(x,t)-T_\infty}{T(0,t)-T_\infty}&lt;/math&gt; where the ''x/L'' curve is the position at which ''T'' is taken. The horizontal axis is the value of ''Bi&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''.


The third chart in each set was supplemented by Gröber in 1961 and this particular one shows the dimensionless heat transferred from the wall as a function of a dimensionless time variable. The vertical axis is a plot of ''Q/Q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'', the ratio of actual heat transfer to the amount of total possible heat transfer before ''T=T&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' . On the horizontal axis is the plot of ''(Bi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(Fo)'', a dimensionless time variable.

==Infinitely long cylinder==
For the infinitely long cylinder, the Heisler chart is based on the first term in an exact solution to a [[Bessel function]].&lt;ref name=Cengel/&gt;

Each chart plots similar curves to the previous examples, and on each axis is plotted a similar variable.

==Sphere (of radius r&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;)==
The Heisler chart for a sphere is based on the first term in the exact [[Fourier series]] solution:

&lt;ref name=Cengel/&gt;

These charts can be used similar to the first two sets and are plots of similar variables.

==Modern alternatives==
Currently there are programs that provide numerical solutions to the same problems, without using transcendental functions or infinite series. Examples of these programs can be found  [http://faculty.virginia.edu/ribando/modules/OneDTransient/index.htm here].&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.virginia.edu/ribando/modules/OneDTransient/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program''' ('''HAARP''') was initiated as an [[ionosphere|ionospheric]] research program jointly funded by the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], and the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA).&lt;ref name="FAQ Sheet"&gt;
{{cite web|date=15 June 2007 |url=http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/factSheet.html |title=HAARP Fact Sheet |publisher=HAARP |accessdate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007235012/http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/factSheet.html |archivedate=7 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed and built by [[BAE Systems|BAE Advanced Technologies]] (BAEAT). Its original purpose was to analyze the ionosphere and investigate the potential for developing ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance.&lt;ref name="Purpose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/prpeis.html |title=Purpose and Objectives of the HAARP Program |publisher=HAARP |accessdate=27 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001114140/http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/prpeis.html |archivedate=1 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a university-owned facility, HAARP is a high-power, high-frequency transmitter used for study of the ionosphere.

The most prominent instrument at HAARP is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power [[radio frequency]] [[transmitter]] facility operating in the [[high frequency]] (HF) band. The IRI is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the [[ionosphere]]. Other instruments, such as a [[VHF]] and a [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[radar]], a [[fluxgate compass|fluxgate]] [[magnetometer]], a digisonde (an [[ionospheric sounding]] device), and an induction magnetometer, are used to study the physical processes that occur in the excited region.

Work on the HAARP facility began in 1993. The current working IRI was completed in 2007; its prime contractor was [[BAE Systems Inc.|BAE Systems Advanced Technologies]].&lt;ref name="FAQ Sheet" /&gt; As of 2008, HAARP had incurred around $250 million in tax-funded construction and operating costs. In May 2014, it was announced that the HAARP program would be permanently shut down later in the year.&lt;ref name="ADNCole2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adn.com/2014/05/14/3470442/air-force-prepares-to-dismantle.html |title=Air Force prepares to dismantle HAARP ahead of summer shutdown |author=Dermot Cole |date=2014-05-14 |publisher=Anchorage Daily News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517010257/http://www.adn.com/2014/05/14/3470442/air-force-prepares-to-dismantle.html |archivedate=17 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After discussions between the parties, ownership of the facility and its equipment was transferred to the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] in August 2015.&lt;ref name="UAF"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rozell |first=Ned |date=6 September 2015 |title=Under new management, Alaska's HAARP facility open for business again |url=http://www.adn.com/article/20150906/under-new-management-alaskas-haarp-facility-open-business-again |newspaper=Alaska Dispatch News |access-date=10 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HAARP is a target of [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]], who claim that it is capable of [[Weather warfare|"weaponizing" weather]]. Commentators and scientists say that advocates of this theory are uninformed, as claims made fall well outside the abilities of the facility, if not the scope of natural science.&lt;ref name=PopSci /&gt;&lt;ref name="Naiditch"/&gt;

==History==
HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program) began in 1990. [[Ted Stevens]], Republican U.S. senator from Alaska, helped win approval for the facility,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nature.com/news/us-ionospheric-research-facility-to-close-1.15243|title = US ionospheric research facility to close|date = 16 May 2014|accessdate = 18 August 2014|website = Nature|publisher = Nature|last = Weinberger|first = Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and construction began in 1993.

In early May 2013, HAARP was temporarily shut down, awaiting a change between contractors to operate the facility. In July 2013, HAARP program manager James Keeney said, "[[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] is expected on site as a client to finish up some research in fall 2013 and winter 2014."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HAARP Facility Shuts Down|url=http://www.arrl.org/news/view/haarp-facility-shuts-down|publisher=ARRL|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EarthSky"&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrd|first=Deborah|title=Crazy weather?

[[Ahtna, Incorporated]], the [[Alaska native corporation|Alaska Native corporation]] serving the region of Alaska where the HAARP site is located, was reportedly in talks to take over the facility administration contract from Marsh Creek, LLC.&lt;ref name="AK"&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Ben|title=Alaska's controversial HAARP facility closed – will it come back online?|url=http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/20130717/alaska-s-controversial-haarp-facility-closed-will-it-come-back-online|accessdate=18 July 2013|newspaper=Alaska Dispatch|date=18 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the Air Force announced that the HAARP program would be shut down later in 2014.&lt;ref name="ADNCole2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bye-Bye To The Home Of A Favorite Internet Conspiracy Theory | url = https://www.npr.org/2014/06/10/319539712/bye-bye-to-the-home-of-a-favorite-internet-conspiracy-theory | first = Geoff | last = Brumfiel | date = 10 June 2014 | work = NPR | accessdate = 2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While experiments ended in the summer of 2014, the complete shutdown and dismantling of the facility was postponed until at least May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = HAARP closure postponed until 2015 | url = http://www.adn.com/article/20140702/haarp-closure-postponed-until-2015 | first = Dermot | last = Cole | date = 2 July 2014 | work = Alaska Dispatch News | accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-August 2015 control of the facility and its equipment was turned over to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, which is making the facilities available for researchers on a pay-per-use basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |url=https://fallmeeting.agu.org/2015/abstract/future-operations-of-haarp-with-the-uafs-geophysical-institute/ |title=Future Operations of HAARP with the UAF's Geophysical Institute |book-title=Agu Fall Meeting Abstracts |year=2015 |id=AE22A–07 |last1=McCoy |first1=Robert|conference=American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting 2015 |access-date=10 September 2015|bibcode=2015AGUFMAE22A..07M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project overview==
[[File:HAARP20l.jpg|thumb|HAARP antenna array]]
The HAARP project directs a 3.6 [[megawatt|MW]] signal, in the 2.8–10 [[megahertz|MHz]] region of the HF (high-frequency) band, into the [[ionosphere]]. The signal may be pulsed or continuous. Effects of the transmission and any recovery period can be examined using associated instrumentation, including VHF and UHF radars, HF receivers, and optical cameras. According to the HAARP team, this will advance the study of basic natural processes that occur in the ionosphere under the natural but much stronger influence of solar interaction. HAARP also enables studies of how the natural ionosphere affects radio signals.

The insights gleaned at HAARP will enable scientists to develop methods to mitigate these effects to improve the reliability or performance of communication and navigation systems which would have a wide range of both civilian and military uses, such as an increased accuracy of GPS navigation and advances in underwater and underground research and applications. This may lead, among other things, to improved methods for submarine communication or an ability to remotely sense and map the mineral content of the terrestrial subsurface, and perhaps underground complexes, of regions or countries. The current facility lacks range to be used in regions like the oil-rich Middle East, according to one of the researchers involved, but the technology could be put on a mobile platform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/01/irans-nuclear-molemen/ Pentagon Scientists Target Iran’s Nuclear Mole Men]&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was originally funded by the [[Office of Naval Research]] and jointly managed by the ONR and [[Air Force Research Laboratory]], with principal involvement of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Many other US universities and educational institutions were involved in the development of the project and its instruments, namely the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], [[Stanford University]], [[Penn State University]] (ARL), [[Boston College]], [[UCLA]], [[Clemson University]], [[Dartmouth College]], [[Cornell University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[University of Maryland, College Park]], [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University]], [[Virginia Tech]] and the [[University of Tulsa]]. The project's specifications were developed by the universities, who continued to play a major role in the design of future research efforts.

According to HAARP's original management, the project strove for openness, and all activities were logged and publicly available, a practice which continues under the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Scientists without security clearances, even foreign nationals, were routinely allowed on site, which also continues today. HAARP hosts an open house annually, during which time any civilian can tour the entire facility. In addition, scientific results obtained using HAARP are routinely published in major research journals (such as ''[[Geophysical Research Letters]]'' and ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]''), written both by university scientists (American and foreign) and by [[U.S. Department of Defense]] research lab scientists.

==Research==
HAARP's main goal is basic science research in the uppermost portion of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], termed the [[ionosphere]]. Essentially a transition between the atmosphere and the [[magnetosphere]], the ionosphere is where the atmosphere is thin enough that the sun's X-rays and UV rays can reach it, but thick enough that there are enough molecules present to absorb those rays. Consequently, the ionosphere consists of a rapid increase in density of free electrons, beginning at {{abbr|~|approximately}}70&amp;nbsp;km, reaching a peak at ~300&amp;nbsp;km, and then falling off again as the atmosphere disappears entirely by ~1,000&amp;nbsp;km. Various aspects of HAARP can study all of the main layers of the ionosphere.

The profile of the ionosphere is highly variable, changing constantly on timescales of minutes, hours, days, seasons, and years. This profile becomes even more complex near Earth's magnetic poles, where the nearly vertical alignment and intensity of earth's magnetic field can cause physical effects like [[aurora (astronomy)|the aurora]].

The ionosphere is traditionally very difficult to measure. Balloons cannot reach it because the air is too thin, but satellites cannot orbit there because the air is too thick. Hence, most experiments on the ionosphere give only small pieces of information. HAARP approaches the study of the ionosphere by following in the footsteps of an ionospheric heater called [[EISCAT]] near [[Tromsø]], Norway. There, scientists pioneered exploration of the ionosphere by perturbing it with radio waves in the 2–10&amp;nbsp;MHz range, and studying how the ionosphere reacts. HAARP performs the same functions but with more power and a more flexible and agile HF beam.

Some of the main scientific findings from HAARP include:
#Generating [[very low frequency]] (VLF) radio waves by modulated heating of the auroral [[electrojet]], useful because generating VLF waves ordinarily requires gigantic antennas
#Generating weak luminous glow (measurable, but below that visible with a naked eye) from absorbing HAARP's signal
#Generating [[extremely low frequency]] (ELF) waves in the 0.1&amp;nbsp;Hz range. These are next to impossible to produce any other way, because the length of an antenna is dictated by the wavelength of the signal it emits or receives.
#Generating [[Whistler (radio)|whistler-mode]] VLF signals that enter the [[magnetosphere]] and propagate to the other hemisphere, interacting with [[Van Allen radiation belt]] particles along the way
#VLF remote sensing of the heated ionosphere

[[Research]] at the HAARP has included:

#[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] line observations
#Stimulated electron emission observations
#[[Gyro frequency]] heating research
#Spread F observations (blurring of ionospheric echoes of radio waves due to irregularities in electron density in the [[Ionosphere#F layer|F layer]])

#[[Polar mesospheric summer echoes]] (PMSE) have been studied, probing the [[mesosphere]] using the IRI as a powerful [[radar]], and with a 28&amp;nbsp;MHz radar and two VHF radars at 49&amp;nbsp;MHz and 139&amp;nbsp;MHz. The presence of multiple radars spanning both [[High frequency|HF]] and [[Very high frequency|VHF]] bands allows scientists to make comparative measurements that may someday lead to an understanding of the processes that form these elusive phenomena.

== Instrumentation and operation ==
The main instrument at HAARP is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI). This is a high-power, high-frequency [[phased array]] radio [[transmitter]] with a set of 180 [[antenna (radio)|antennas]], disposed in an array of 12x15 units that occupy a rectangle of about {{convert|30-40|acre|ha|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nap.edu/read/18620/chapter/2 "Opportunities for High-Power, High-Frequency Transmitters to Advance Ionospheric/Thermospheric Research: Report of a Workshop"], National Academies Press. National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2014. Retrieved 8 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9jsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq "Ionospheric Manipulation Made Easy"], Abe Streep. Popular Science Vol. 273, No. 1. July 2008. Retrieved 8 feb 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The IRI is used to temporarily energize a small portion of the [[ionosphere]]. The study of these disturbed volumes yields important information for understanding natural ionospheric processes.

During active ionospheric research, the signal generated by the transmitter system is delivered to the [[Antenna array (electromagnetic)|antenna array]] and transmitted in an upward direction. At an altitude between {{convert|70|to|350|km|0|abbr=on}} (depending on operating frequency), the signal is partially absorbed in a small volume several tens of kilometers in diameter and a few meters thick over the IRI. The intensity of the [[High frequency|HF]] signal in the ionosphere is less than 3&amp;nbsp;µW/cm², tens of thousands of times less than the Sun's natural electromagnetic radiation reaching the earth and hundreds of times less than even the normal random variations in intensity of the Sun's natural [[ultraviolet]] (UV) energy which creates the ionosphere. The small effects that are produced, however, can be observed with the sensitive scientific instruments installed at the HAARP facility, and these observations can provide information about the dynamics of [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]] and insight into the processes of solar-terrestrial interactions.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each part of the two section crossed dipoles are individually fed from a specially designed, custom-built transmitter that operates at very low distortion levels. The [[Effective Radiated Power]] (ERP) of the IRI is limited by more than a factor of 10 at its lower operating frequencies. Much of this is due to higher antenna losses and a less efficient antenna pattern.

The IRI can transmit between 2.7 and 10&amp;nbsp;MHz, a frequency range that lies above the AM radio broadcast band and well below Citizens' Band frequency allocations. However, HAARP is licensed to transmit only in certain segments of this frequency range. When the IRI is transmitting, the bandwidth of the transmitted signal is 100&amp;nbsp;kHz or less. The IRI can transmit in continuous waves (CW) or in pulses as short as 10 microseconds (µs). CW transmission is generally used for ionospheric modification, while transmission in short pulses frequently repeated is used as a radar system. Researchers can run experiments that use both modes of transmission, first modifying the ionosphere for a predetermined amount of time, then measuring the decay of modification effects with pulsed transmissions.

There are other geophysical instruments for research located at the HAARP facility. Some of them are:
* A [[fluxgate compass|fluxgate]] [[magnetometer]] built by the University of Alaska Fairbanks [[Geophysical Institute]], available to chart variations in the Earth's magnetic field. Rapid and sharp changes of the magnetic field may indicate a [[geomagnetic storm]].
* A [[ionospheric sounding|digisonde]] that can provide ionospheric profiles, allowing scientists to choose appropriate frequencies for IRI operation. The HAARP makes current and historic digisonde information available online.
* An induction magnetometer, provided by the [[University of Tokyo]], that measures the changing geomagnetic field in the [[Ultra Low Frequency]] (ULF) range of 0–5&amp;nbsp;Hz.
The facility is powered by a set of five (5) 2500 kilowatt generators being driven by EMD 20-645-E4 diesel locomotive engines.

== Site ==
The project site ({{Coord|62|23|30|N|145|09|03|W|}}) is north of [[Gakona, Alaska|Gakona]], [[Alaska]] just west of [[Wrangell-Saint Elias National Park]]. An [[environmental impact statement]] led to permission for an array of up to 180 [[antennas]] to be erected.&lt;ref&gt;

#The '''Developmental Prototype''' (DP) had 18 antenna elements, organized in three columns by six rows. It was fed with a total of 360 kilowatts (kW) combined transmitter output power. The DP transmitted just enough power for the most basic of ionospheric testing.
#The '''Filled Developmental Prototype''' (FDP) had 48 antenna units arrayed in six columns by eight rows, with 960&amp;nbsp;kW of transmitter power. It was fairly comparable to other [[Ionospheric heater#Current facilities|ionospheric heating facilities]]. This was used for a number of successful scientific experiments and ionospheric exploration campaigns over the years.
#The '''Final IRI''' (FIRI) is the final build of the IRI. It has 180 antenna units, organized in 15 columns by 12 rows, yielding a theoretical maximum gain of 31&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]]. A total of 3.6&amp;nbsp;MW of transmitter power will feed it, but the power is focused in the upward direction by the geometry of the large [[phased array]] of antennas which allow the antennas to work together in controlling the direction. {{As of|March 2007}}, all the antennas were in place, the final phase was completed and the [[Antenna array (electromagnetic)|antenna array]] was undergoing testing aimed at fine-tuning its performance to comply with safety requirements required by regulatory agencies. The facility officially began full operations in its final 3.6 MW transmitter power completed status in the summer of 2007, yielding an effective radiated power (ERP) of 5.1 [[Gigawatts]] or 97.1 [[dBW]] at maximum output. However, the site typically operates at a fraction of that value due to the lower [[antenna gain]] exhibited at standard operational frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
{{see also|List of conspiracy theories#Weaponry|l1=List of conspiracy theories: Weaponry}}

HAARP is the subject of numerous [[conspiracy theories]]. Various individuals have speculated about hidden motivations and capabilities of the project. For example, [[Rosalie Bertell]] warned in 1996 about the deployment of HAARP as a military weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Rosalie Bertell}}, [http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/212/45492.html Background on the HAARP Project].

'''IDEF0''', a compound acronym ("Icam DEFinition for Function Modeling", where ICAM is an acronym for "Integrated Computer Aided Manufacturing"), is a [[function modeling]] methodology for describing [[manufacturing]] functions, which offers a functional [[modeling language]] for the analysis, development, [[reengineering (software)|reengineering]], and integration of [[information system]]s; [[business process]]es; or [[software engineering]] analysis.&lt;ref name="DAC01"&gt;[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-885j-aircraft-systems-engineering-fall-2005/readings/sefguide_01_01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

IDEF0 is part of the [[IDEF]] family of modeling languages in the field of [[software engineering]], and is built on the functional modeling language [[Structured Analysis and Design Technique]] (SADT).

== Overview ==
The IDEF0 Functional Modeling method is designed to model the decisions, actions, and activities of an organization or system.&lt;ref name = "VG00"&gt;[[Varun Grover]], [[William J. Kettinger]] (2000). ''Process Think: Winning Perspectives for Business Change in the Information Age. p.168.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was derived from the established graphic modeling language [[Structured Analysis and Design Technique]] (SADT) developed by [[Douglas T. Ross]] and [[SofTech, Inc.]] In its original form, IDEF0 includes both a definition of a graphical modeling language ([[syntax]] and [[semantics]]) and a description of a comprehensive methodology for developing models.&lt;ref name= "ITL93"&gt;[http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/idef02.doc FIPS Publication 183] released of IDEFØ December 1993 by the Computer Systems Laboratory of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&lt;/ref&gt; The US Air Force commissioned the SADT developers "to develop a [[function model]] method for analyzing and communicating the functional perspective of a system. IDEF0 should assist in organizing system analysis and promote effective communication between the analyst and the customer through simplified graphical devices".&lt;ref name = "VG00"/&gt;

Where the [[Flow chart|Functional flow block diagram]] is used to show the functional flow of a [[Product (business)|product]], IDEF0 is used to show [[data flow]], system control, and the functional flow of lifecycle processes. IDEF0 is capable of graphically representing a wide variety of business, manufacturing and other types of enterprise operations to any level of detail. It provides rigorous and precise description, and promotes consistency of usage and interpretation. It is well-tested and proven through many years of use by government and private industry. It can be generated by a variety of computer graphics tools. Numerous commercial products specifically support development and analysis of IDEF0 diagrams and models.&lt;ref name="DAC01"/&gt;

An associated technique, Integration Definition for Information Modeling (IDEF1x), is used to supplement IDEF0 for data-intensive systems. The IDEF0 standard, Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 183 (FIPS 183), and the IDEF1x standard (FIPS 184) are maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).&lt;ref name="DAC01"/&gt;

FIPS PUB 183 "Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0)," was withdrawn as a Federal Standard (in favor of OPEN Specifications and Standards) September 2, 2008, as cited in "The Federal Register",  Volume 73, page 51276 (73FR/51276). &lt;ref name="fips_withdrawn" /&gt;

== History ==
During the 1970s, the U.S. Air Force Program for [[Integrated Computer Aided Manufacturing]] (ICAM) sought to increase manufacturing productivity through systematic application of computer technology.  The ICAM program identified the need for better analysis and communication techniques for people involved in improving manufacturing productivity. As a result, in 1981 the ICAM program developed a series of techniques known as the IDEF (ICAM Definition) techniques which included the following:&lt;ref name= "ITL93"/&gt;

* IDEF0, used to produce a "[[function model]]".  A function model is a structured representation of the functions, activities or processes within the modeled system or subject area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADB062457 ICAM Architecture Part II-Volume IV - Function Modeling Manual (IDEF0)], AFWAL-TR-81-4023, Materials Laboratory, Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories, Air Force Systems Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433, June 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
* IDEF1, used to produce an "information model".  An information model represents the structure and semantics of information within the modeled system or subject area.&lt;ref&gt;ICAM Architecture Part II, Volume V - Information Modeling Manual (IDEF1), AFWAL-TR-81-4023, Materials Laboratory, Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories, Air Force Systems Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433, June 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
* IDEF2, used to produce a "dynamics model".  A dynamics model represents the time-varying behavioral characteristics of the modeled system or subject area.&lt;ref&gt;ICAM Architecture Part II, Volume VI - Dynamics Modeling Manual (IDEF2),
AFWAL-TR-81-4023, Materials Laboratory, Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories, Air
Force Systems Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433, June 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, the U.S. Air Force Integrated Information Support System program enhanced the IDEF1 information modeling technique to form [[IDEF1X]] (IDEF1 Extended), a semantic data modeling technique. By the 1990s, IDEF0 and IDEF1X techniques are widely used in the government, industrial and commercial sectors, supporting modeling efforts for a wide range of enterprises and application domains. In 1991 the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) received support from the U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Corporate Information Management (DoD/CIM), to develop one or more [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] (FIPS) for modeling techniques.  The techniques selected were IDEF0 for function modeling and IDEF1X for [[information modeling]]. These FIPS documents are based on the IDEF manuals published by the U.S. Air Force in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name= "ITL93"/&gt;


== IDEF0 topics ==
[[Image:IDEF Top-Level Context Diagram.jpg|320px|thumb|Top-Level Context Diagram]]

=== The IDEF0 approach ===
IDEF0 may be used to model a wide variety of automated and  non-automated systems. For new systems, it may be used first to define the [[requirements]] and specify the functions, and then to design an implementation that meets the requirements and performs the functions. For existing systems, IDEF0 can be used to analyze the functions the system performs and to record the mechanisms (means) by which these are done. The result of applying IDEF0 to a system is a model that consists of a hierarchical series of diagrams, text, and glossary cross-referenced to each other.  The two primary modeling components are functions (represented on a diagram by boxes) and the data and objects that inter-relate those functions (represented by arrows).&lt;ref name= "ITL93"/&gt;

=== IDEF0 Building blocks ===
[[Image:IDEF Box Format.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0) Box Format]]
The IDEF0 model displayed here on the left is based on a simple [[syntax]]. Each activity is described by a verb-based label placed in a box. Inputs are shown as arrows entering the left side of the activity box while output are shown as exiting arrows on the right side of the box. Controls are displayed as arrows entering the top of the box and mechanisms are displayed as arrows entering from the bottom of the box. Inputs, Controls, Outputs, and Mechanisms (ICOM) are all referred to as concepts.&lt;ref name = "VG00"/&gt;

* ''Arrow'' : A directed line, composed of one or more arrow segments, that models an open channel or conduit conveying data or objects from source (no arrowhead) to use (with arrowhead). There are 4 arrow classes:  Input Arrow, Output Arrow, Control Arrow, and Mechanism Arrow (includes Call Arrow).  See Arrow Segment, Boundary Arrow, Internal Arrow.
* ''Box'' : A rectangle, containing a name and number, used to represent a function.

Image:2 Arrow Syntax.svg|Arrow Syntax
Image:3 Arrow Positions and Roles.svg|Arrow Positions and Roles
Image:4 Label and Name Semantics.svg|Label and Name Semantics
&lt;/gallery&gt;

* ''Context'' : The immediate environment in which a function (or set of functions on a diagram) operates.
* ''Decomposition'' : The partitioning of a modeled function into its component functions.

Image:7 Detail Reference Expression Use.svg|Detail Reference Expression Use
Image:11 Arrow Fork and Join Structures.svg|Arrow Fork and Join Structures
&lt;/gallery&gt;

* ''Fork'' : The junction at which an IDEF0 arrow segment (going from source to use) divides into two or more arrow segments. May denote unbundling of meaning.

Image:21 Negative Node-Numbered Context.svg|Negative Node-Numbered Context
&lt;/gallery&gt;

* ''Function'' : An activity, process, or transformation (modeled by an IDEF0 box) identified by a verb or verb phrase that describes what must be accomplished.
* ''Join'' : The junction at which an IDEF0 arrow segment (going from source to use) merges with one or more other arrow segments to form a single arrow segment.  May denote bundling of arrow segment meanings
* ''Node'' : A box from which child boxes originate; a parent box.  See Node Index, Node Tree, Node Number, Node Reference, Diagram Node Number.
[[Image:IDEF Diagram Example.jpg|thumb|320px|IDEF0 Diagram Example]]

=== Graphical notation ===
IDEF0 is a model that consists of a hierarchical series of diagrams, text, and glossary cross referenced to each other. The two primary modeling components are: 
* functions (represented on a diagram by boxes), and
* data and objects that interrelate those functions (represented by arrows).
As shown by Figure 3 the position at which the arrow attaches to a box conveys the specific role of the interface. The controls enter the top of the box. The inputs, the data or objects acted upon by the operation, enter the box from the left. The outputs of the operation leave the right-hand side of the box. Mechanism arrows that provide supporting means for performing the function join (point up to) the bottom of the box.&lt;ref name="DAC01"/&gt;

=== The IDEF0 process ===
The IDEF0 process starts with the identification of the prime function to be decomposed. This function
is identified on a “Top Level Context Diagram,” that defines the scope of the particular IDEF0 analysis. An example of a Top Level Context Diagram for an information system management process is shown in Figure 3. From this diagram lower-level diagrams are generated. An example of a derived diagram, called a “child” in IDEF0 terminology, for a life cycle function is shown in Figure 4.&lt;ref name="DAC01"/&gt;

=== Federal Information Processing Standards ===
In Dec 1993 the National Institute of Standards and Technology announcing the standard for Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0) in the category Software Standard, Modeling Techniques. This publication announces the adoption of the IDEF0 as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). This standard was based on the Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories [[Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing]] (ICAM) Architecture from June 1981.&lt;ref name= "ITL93"/&gt;


On September 2, 2008, the associated NIST standard, FIPS 183, has been withdrawn (decision on Federal Register vol. 73 / page 51276 &lt;ref name="fips_withdrawn"&gt; [https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2008-09-02/pdf/E8-20138.pdf Withdrawn FIPS Listed by Number, Updated 12/15/16])&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility''' is a part of the [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] (ITER) in [[Padova]], [[Veneto]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.euro-fusion.org/newsletter/iter-neutral-beam-test-facility-construction-is-progressing-fast-in-padova/&lt;/ref&gt; The facility is being built to host the full-scale prototype of the reactor's neutral beam injector, MITICA, and a smaller prototype of its ion source, SPIDER.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stacks.iop.org/0029-5515/55/i=8/a=083025 V. Toigo, D. Boilson, T. Bonicelli, R. Piovan, M. Hanada, et al. 2015 Nucl. Fusion 55:8 083025]&lt;/ref&gt; SPIDER is planned to start its operation in December 2017. SPIDER will be used to optimize the ion beam source, to optimize the use of cesium vapor, and to verify the uniformity of the extracted ion beam also during long pulses.

== ITER Heating Neutral Beams ==

To deliver power, two heating [[Neutral Beam Injection|neutral beam injectors]] provide the power of 17MW each to a four-meter diameter container containing burning fusion plasma. This is the main auxiliary heating system of the reactor. &lt;!-- To reach the container center, an about 1MeV deuterium beam having is required.  why is this important here? --&gt;Due to its low conversion efficiency, the neutral beam injector first needs to start a precursor negative ion beam of 40A, and then neutralizes it by passing it through a gas cell (&lt;60%), and then by a residual ion dump (the remaining 40% — 20% negative, 20% positive). The neutralized beam is then dumped on a [[calorimeter]] during conditioning phases, or coupled with the plasma. Further reionization losses or interception with the mechanical components reduce its current to 17A.&lt;ref&gt;LR Grisham, P Agostinetti, G Barrera, P Blatchford, D Boilson, J Chareyre, et al., Recent improvements to the ITER neutral beam system design, Fusion Engineering and Design 87 (11), 1805-1815&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
Heating and Current Drive [[Neutral Beam Injector]]
==The ITER Heating Neutral Beams==
The ITER Heating and Current Drive [[Neutral Beam Injector]]&lt;ref&gt;LR Grisham, P Agostinetti, G Barrera, P Blatchford, D Boilson, J Chareyre, et al., Recent improvements to the ITER neutral beam system design, Fusion Engineering and Design 87 (11), 1805-1815&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the main auxiliary heating system of the [[ITER]] plasma: each of the two Heating Neutral Beam (HNB) injectors will provide 17MW to the fusion plasma. In order to reach the center of the burning plasma with radius of 2 meters, a

deuterium beam having energy of around 1MeV is required. Due to the low conversion efficiency of NBI systems, to provide the required power to the plasma a precursor negative ion beam of 40A is necessary. The ion beam crosses a gas cell where it is partially neutralized (&lt;60%) with the remaining ions (20% negative, 20% positive ions) removed by the next component of the beam line, the so called residual ion dump. The neutral beam is then dumped on a calorimeter during conditioning phases, or coupled with the plasma. Further re-ionization losses or interception with the mechanical components reduce its current to 17A.--&gt;

== Purposes ==

The role of the test facility includes research and development on the following topics:
* voltage holding: due to neutron environment, this will be the first beam source at -1MV with vacuum insulation instead of gas insulation (SF_6 gas is typically used);
* negative ion formation: the requirement on the extracted current density from the cesiated ion source is at the limit of the present technology of plasma ion sources. 
* beam optics: the precursor ion beam is generated in a multigrid electrostatic accelerator, having 1280 apertures in each of the 7 grids composing it. Since the overall width of the beam along the beam drift (about 25 meters) is due to the optics of each of the 1280 beamlets, the grid alignment and the disturbances produced by magnetic fields and electrostatic error fields are to be carefully verified.
* vacuum pumps: two 8m long, 1.6m high cryopumps will be installed on each side of the vacuum vessel. The fatigue life of components operating with cycles between 4K and 400K is to be verified.
* heat load on mechanical components: on the electrodes used for beam acceleration, and along the beam path, mechanical components are subject to very high thermal loads. These loads are continuously applied during long pulses, up to 1h. These loads are anyhow lower than the heat loads expected on the ITER divertor plates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="941">'''The Instituto de Medicina Tropical Alexander von Humboldt (IMTAvH)''' is a [[tropical medicine]] institute at [[Cayetano Heredia University]] in [[Lima]], Peru. It was founded in 1968, under the direction of Prof. Hugo Lumbreras Cruz (1924 - 1985), a distinguished Peruvian doctor and parasitologist. His work as Director was continued by Dr. [[Humberto Guerra Allison]] and later by Dr. [[Eduardo Gotuzzo Herencia]]. The Instituto de Medicina Tropical Alexander von Humboldt has ongoing investigations in tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, malaria and HIV, both in its site in Lima and in several field sites such as Iquitos, Cuzco and La Merced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8179">'''Instructional rounds''' is a process that school districts and schools use to better understand teaching and learning in schools in order to improve learning at scale. In an instructional rounds session, a group of educators from perhaps 20 to 40 in size makes a series of visits to classrooms to observe what is taking place in the instructional core (the interactions between students and teachers in the presence of content).  Low inference observation notes are taken about a learning problem identified by the school being observed.  The observation notes are used to create a picture of what has been seen in teaching and learning practices throughout the school.  It is these practices that are shared with the school, not information about individual teachers or students. Adapted from the practice of [[grand rounds]] in medical school,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the aim of instructional rounds is to observe teaching and learning to discern root causes for problems identified by the school and to help the school and district create more productive outcomes. Distinct from [[supervision]] and evaluation, rounds are used to describe what is happening in classrooms and the share observations with educators, and are not intended to be [[evaluative]].

== Origin ==
The process of instructional rounds was adapted from medical rounds model that is used in schools of medicine and teaching hospitals to improve practice of prospective and current doctors in diagnosing and curing patients. Physicians use medical rounds as a major way of improving their theory and practice. "In the most commonly used version of medical rounds, a group of medical interns, residents, and supervising or attending physicians visit patients, observe and discuss the evidence for diagnoses, and, after a thorough analysis of evidence, discuss possible treatments."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Description of common practice ==

Instructional rounds include several steps: formation of a network that ideally includes representative members from all those who impact student learning; choosing a problem to be addressed; classroom observation; observation debrief ; detection of the next steps, and regular repetition of this process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=City|first1=Elizabeth|title=Learning from Instructional Rounds|journal=Educational Leadership|date=2011|volume=69, number 2|issue=Coaching: The New Leadership Skill|pages=36–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Network formation ===
Network formation involves the gathering of educators who will regularly meet with each other to do rounds. There are not specific criteria sets for the creation of networks, it depends on the situation, time and preferences of educators. Different kinds of networks could be used to do rounds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=City|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Elmore|first2=Richard|last3=Fiarman|first3=Sarah|last4=Lee|first4=Teitel|title=Instructional rounds in education: A network approach to improving teaching and learning|date=2011|publisher=Harvard Education Press|location=8 Story Street First Floor, Cambridge, MA 02138|isbn=9781934742167|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them are cross-functional in which teachers and administrators work together, while others are [[homogeneous]] in nature composed of [[superintendent (education)|superintendent]]s or teachers exclusively. Instructional rounds could be integrated into existing networks or specially formed new networks of educators. Sometimes members of the network are selected intentionally, according to the subject, content they teach or problem area they share. Other networks are more [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]], for instance, teachers with the same planning time engage in rounds together.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Choosing problem of practice ===
The problem of practice is a specific issue that the school  needs constructive feedback on, worries about or struggles against.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The problem should be [[observable]] and focused on improving teaching. It is unsolved problem that the school has spent time and money to address, but it is in further need of assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Leading instructional rounds in education|last=Fowler-Finn|first=Thomas|publisher = Harvard Education Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-61250-526-8|location = 8 Story Street, Cambridge, MA 02138|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different ways of identifying problems of practice. The best way is to relate these problems to continuous school improvement and to proceed based on data. To determine the problem of practice sometimes the entire staff gathers or only the leadership team meets to identify a problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An example of a problem of practice could be the following: "In reading and writing, our students seem to be doing relatively well on [[Encoding|decoding]], [[vocabulary]], and simple writing tasks, but they are not doing as well as we had hoped on comprehension free-response tasks. Teachers have begun using a workshop method to work with smaller groups of students, but there is no consistency in what happens in those small groups".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Classroom observation ===
After determining the problem of practice, the network splits into smaller groups of 4-5 teachers that visit approximately 4-5 classrooms for 25 minutes each. Observers collect descriptive data rather than evaluative, meaning that they do not have any [[rubric|rubrics]] to guide them. Observers do have guiding questions associated with the problem they are investigating. For instance, 'What are students and teachers doing and saying?,' 'What is the assignment?,' 'What do students do when they do not understand the concept or instruction?'.

Observers do not look at every issue in the classroom, but only those connected with the problem of practice. For instance, if the issue is lack of higher order thinking skills among students, observers do not pay attention on behavior and attendance of students, their involvement in the task, or teacher behavior, such as writing objectives on the board. Observers attempt to find the cause of the existing problem of practice in school and then identify a viable cure for it.

It is very important that observers do not talk between class observations and save everything they saw, their descriptive feedback, for the official debrief.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Observation debrief ===
The process of debrief consists of three steps: [[description]], [[analysis]], and [[prediction]]. During the description stage, all groups of the network meet together and share their evidence that pertains to the problem of practice with the others. The evidence should be specific and descriptive rather than evaluative and general. Regular practice and peer help could facilitate learning to collect specific and descriptive evidence.

Having gathered a set of evidence, the network can begin analyzing it by looking at trends, patterns, and exceptions across the data. Examples of patterns could be: Students are divided into groups, but work individually; teacher asks simple questions that requires short 1-2 words answers. Each groups of teachers share trends and patterns that have seen. This could help educators to determine common patterns in subject area, grade level and across school. However, sometimes patterns could vary in each subject or grade level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At the prediction stage observers answer to the following question, “If you were a student in these classes today and you did everything the teacher asked you to do, what would you know and be able to do?” This question is asked to see what students could learn as a result of the completed assignments and tasks in the class. The responses of the observers could be: Learners will be able to solve mathematical problems, recall information, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Detection of the next steps ===

There are different ways of detecting next steps of work. Some networks [[brainstorming|brainstorm]] action plans for the following week, next month or by the end of educational year. Other networks creates reflective questions to reflect

[[File:Three buffered mults - Today's completed builds... (2014-12-18 12.32.13 by c-g.).jpg|thumb|Custom built mult circuits and panels]]
A '''mult box''' is "a metal box with multiple outputs of a single audio source (one microphone connected to twenty jacks so that twenty people can record that microphone)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euonline.org/members/continui/audioendearment/index.html |publisher=NPR |first= Mark |last=Greenhouse |title=Audio Terms of Endearment |date= July 7, 2007 |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mult box is sometimes called a '[[press box]]', but that term is usually reserved for the sports media's section of an arena. It may also be called a '''press mult box''' or '''press bridge'''.&lt;ref name=View&gt;{{cite web|url=http://garypalamara.com/Articles_Press%20Conference%202.htm|last=Palamara|first=Gary|publisher=Radio World|title=The View From the Back of the Room - II: Tips for Reporters and Others Covering Press Events|date=June 20, 2007|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[sound engineer]] connects several [[microphone]]s to allow all of them to get clean, high-quality audio.&lt;ref name=View /&gt;

Reporters use a mult box frequently at [[press conference]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gearslutz.com/board/remote-possibilities-acoustic-music-location-recording/331423-mult-box-set-up-press-feed.html |title=Mult Box Set Up for Press Feed |date=September 29, 2008 |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially when politicians give such interviews in small spaces, where not all the reporters in a [[press pool]] can access the interviewee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/rick-santorums-way-win-run-campaign-shoestring-budget-162734670--abc-news.html |publisher=Yahoo News |authors=Shushanna Walsh and Michael Falcone |title=Rick Santorum's Way to Win? Run a Campaign on a Shoestring Budget |date=February 15, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
A whole set of [[etiquette]] and [[mores]] has developed amongst [[journalist]]s governing the use of mult boxes.  Because it is often difficult to get a good [[sound recording]] from a [[Dictation machine|digital recorder]] for later broadcast or [[:wikt:transcribe|transcription]] for newspaper reporting, journalists have developed informal rules for their use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsjournalists.com/forum/index.php?topic=57499.0|author="Johnny Dangerously" ([[pseudonym]])|title=Mult box procedure and etiquette|publisher=[[Sportsjournalists.com]] |date=June 16, 2008|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the media should treat the sound engineer well, because while reporters can be selfish and competitive with each other, and the equipment can go wrong in many ways, the engineer allows all of them to get a good signal.&lt;ref name=View /&gt;  It is also extremely important to show up early to press conferences; this "early bird gets the worm" habit allows one to test equipment, to avoid problems caused by the chaos of most press conferences, and to work cooperatively with the engineer.&lt;ref name=View /&gt;

The [[NCAA]] has a specific, written policy on the use of mult boxes for all NCAA championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.turner.ncaa.com/dr/ncaa/ncaa/release/sites/default/files/files/NewsMediaPress%20Conferences.pdf|author=unknown|title=NCAA Championship (News, Media and Press Conferences) |publisher=[[NCAA]]|year=2016|accessdate=Oct 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
[[United States]] government agencies usually provide a mult box for media use at press conferences.&lt;ref&gt;See ''e.g.'', http://www.ntsb.gov/news/2012/120323.html [[NTSB]] press release; accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, they are not always consistent; the [[United States Department of Energy]] sometimes makes a mult box available, but then does not make a "media avail with speakers"; yet at other times does ''not'' allow a mult box but follows it up with a "press availability".&lt;ref name=Energy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.gov/articles/tomorrow-secretary-chu-visit-south-carolina-attend-small-business-summit-highlight-clean|publisher=United States Department of Energy|title=TOMORROW: Secretary Chu to Visit South Carolina to Attend Small Business Summit, Highlight Clean Energy Innovations With Rep. Clyburn (press release)|date=August 22, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some state government agencies or courts also may provide such equipment for free to media, but charge a fee to rent it for private events held on state property.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', in [[Ohio]], [http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/PIO/MediaRequestInfo/default.asp [[Supreme Court of Ohio]]'s Guidelines for News Organizations Broadcasting, Televising, Recording and Photographing Sessions of Court], [http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/events/YourEvent/index.aspx Ohio Statehouse's webpage on "Your Event at the Statehouse"], and [http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/Communications/Media/UseOfTapeRecorders.aspx Ohio Statehouse's webpage on "Use of Tape Recorders at the Ohio Statehouse For News Media and Others"]; all accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some colleges and universities provide the use of a mult box ''gratis'' to media who need it to record large academic events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], speaker, or [[funeral]],&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2012/05/commencement-events-may-10-11-at-vanderbilt-university/ [[Vanderbilt University]] press release], [http://www.cianewswire.com/2012/05/mediaalert_hfhk.html [[The Culinary Institute of America]] press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310024625/http://www.cianewswire.com/2012/05/mediaalert_hfhk.html |date=2013-03-10 }}, and [http://www.vt.edu/in-memoriam/dec12-service.html [[Virginia Tech]] press information web page] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120805200257/http://www.vt.edu/in-memoriam/dec12-service.html |date=2012-08-05 }}; both accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but charge for leasing to certain organizations.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://www.css.washington.edu/Rental-List [[University of Washington]] Classroom Support Services "Rental List" web page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620195509/http://www.css.washington.edu/Rental-List |date=2010-06-20 }} and [http://www.css.washington.edu/Fee-Categories University of Washington web page listign which groups are charged what rates]; see also [http://www.nyu.edu/campusmedia/events/rates.html [[New York University]] web page for Events Media Services Rates] and [http://www.nyu.edu/campusmedia/events/policies.html New York University policies web page]; all accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Larger houses of worship, such as a [[basilica]] or [[cathedral]], may provide a mult box for certain religious services, but not others, depending on their policies and the nature of the [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] or [[eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', [http://archphila.org/press%20releases/pr001946.htm [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]] press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703053610/http://archphila.org/press%20releases/pr001946.htm |date=2012-07-03 }}; accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Large media events, such as the [[Grammy Awards]], [[Alamo Bowl]], etc., often provide a mult box for media at their press conferences as a convenience.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'' [http://www.alamobowl.com/main/media_schedule.php Valero Alamo Bowl media schedule &amp; info web page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414130344/http://www.alamobowl.com/main/media_schedule.php |date=2012-04-14 }} and [http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/apr-05-2012-400-am Grammy Awards press release]; both accessed May 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installation==
A mult box can be an extraordinarily expensive piece of audio-visual equipment to purchase,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} so many organizations rent them from a communications company or government agency.  Larger venues may make them available to the media for free, but rent them to private parties.

In 2011, the [[Foreign_relations_of_the_African_Union#Diplomatic_missions|United States Mission to the African Union]] donated a [[state of the art]] mult box to the cash-starved [[African Union]] in a formal ceremony, in which they also presented new [[intern]]s who will be trained to use it.&lt;ref name=AU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usau.usmission.gov/-mult-box-grant-to-the-auc-09/22/11.html|last=|first=|publisher=United States Mission to the African Union|title=United States Mission to the African Union donates Audio Visual Broadcast Media Mult Box to the AUC|date=September 22, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
NECTEC has used green technology in the field of printing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/gadget/288200/nectec-promotes-printing-future&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the foundation of  [[Thailand Organic and Printed Electronics Innovation Centre]] (TOPIC). NECTEC along with public and private sectors have researched the technical feasibility of using [[organic electronics]] in printing ink. It has successfully developed [[graphene]]-based conductive ink in 2011. The ink has five times more conductivity than a typical ink. It is also cheap, contains no contamination, and is suitable for various applications.
It has also developed a software called "Size-Thai"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sizethailand.org/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; that uses [[3D computer graphics|3-D]] body scan to measure the anatomical dimensions of Thai people. This makes Thailand the second nation in Asia to use such a software after Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://nationmultimedia.com/2009/03/03/technology/technology_30096958.php&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected to reduce wastage and help garment retailers to reduce losses. It also has business applications like "virtual-try on" and "made to measure".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1321">'''Nature Detectives''' is an online [[phenology]] research and education project for 4–18-year-olds in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. It is run by the [[Woodland Trust]], as part of the UK Phenology Network.

Participants record the dates they see seasonal events, such as leafing, flowering, bird migration, nesting or fruit ripening in their own recording form on the website. The data they collect is fed into the UKPN national database, which has over 11,000 contributors and now contains over one million records.

The project monitors the activity of birds, insects, amphibians, grasses, fungi, flowers and trees, all of which are being affected by [[climate change]]. There is also information on phenology, climate change and "doing your bit for the environment".

Schools, youth groups, families and individuals all take part, and it is proving a great way to involve children in the natural world and teach them about plants and wildlife and environmental issues.

An '''online exhibition''', also referred to as a '''virtual exhibition''', '''online gallery''', '''cyber-exhibition''', is an [[exhibition]] whose venue is [[cyberspace]].

[[Museum]]s and other organizations create online exhibitions for many reasons.
For example, an online exhibition may: expand on material presented at, or generate interest in, or create a durable online record of, a physical exhibition;  save production costs (insurance, shipping, installation); solve conservation/preservation problems (e.g., handling of fragile or rare objects); reach lots more people: "Access to information is no longer restricted to those who can afford travel and museum visits, but is available to anyone who has access to a computer with an Internet connection.

Unlike physical exhibitions, online exhibitions are not restricted by time; they are not forced to open and close but may be available 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aam-us.org/pubs/mn/MN_SO02_OnlineVisitor.cfm | title=Going Global: Reaching Out for the Online Visitor | author=Klaus Müller | publisher=American Association of Museums | accessdate=October 6, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nonprofit world, many museums, [[libraries]], [[archives]], [[universities]], and other cultural organizations create online exhibitions. A database of such exhibitions is [[Library and Archival Exhibitions on the Web]]. Online exhibitions are also increasingly being utilized by businesses and individuals.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Online exhibition organizers may use techniques such as [[Marquee element|marquee text]], [[Display advertising|display advertisement]]s, and in-event [[email]]s to engage patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.inxpo.com/casting-calls/bid/74900/4-Tips-to-Engage-and-Inform-Attendees-in-Your-Digital-Event|title=4 Tips to Engage and Inform Attendees in Your Digital Event|last=Wolf|first=Lauren|date=11 October 2011|publisher=INXPO|accessdate=3 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714143642/http://web.inxpo.com/casting-calls/bid/74900/4-Tips-to-Engage-and-Inform-Attendees-in-Your-Digital-Event|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=September 2017}}

Various guides have been published to help organizations create effective online exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Thiel, S. (2007). ''Build It Once: A Basic Primer for the Creation of Online Exhibitions.'' The Scarecrow Press, Inc. {{ISBN|081085225X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalfatovic, M. (2002). ''Creating a Winning Online Exhibition: A Guide for Libraries, Archives, and Museums.'' American Library Association. {{ISBN|0838908179}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest museum with a physical existence to create a programme of substantial online exhibitions with high resolution images of artefacts was the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford, the first of which, ''The Measurers: a Flemish Image of Mathematics in the Sixteenth Century'' and an exhibition of early photographs, were published on 21 August 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/measurer/text/title.htm The Measurers: a Flemish Image of Mathematics in the Sixteenth Century]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/features/ephotos/text.htm An exhibition of early photographs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also popular now are virtual exhibitions for business, participation in which allows you to save significant funds and cover a larger number of potential customers, without restriction on the place and time. &lt;ref&gt;[https://expo-online.center/ An example of an online platform with virtual exhibitions for business]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of online exhibitions==
In recent years, new [[virtual museum]]s have published online exhibitions as : 
* [[UMA - Universal Museum of Art]] is an online-only museum which launched 2017. It has the ambition to work universal in virtual reality and is based on two principles: accessibility and innovation. UMA is offering exhibitions through the world art history, it's not connected to one top topic, country or region.
* [[International Museum of Women]] is an online-only museum that does not have a physical building and instead offers online exhibitions about women's issues globally as well as an online community. Online exhibitions include "Imagining Ourselves" (launched 2006) about women's identity, "Women, Power and Politics" (2008), and "Economica: Women and the Global Economy" (2009).
* [[Tucson LGBTQ Museum]] is an online-only museum that does not have a physical building and instead offers online exhibitions about LGBTQ history. The online photographic, audio, video, text, and other historical exhibitions include exhibits from the 1700s to the present day. The effort began in the summer of 1967 and spanned almost 50 years. 
* [[International New Media Gallery]] (INMG) is an online museum specialising in moving image and screen-based art. The INMG is dedicated to exploring current debates and topics in art history: touching on areas such as migration, war, environmental activism and the internet itself. The gallery publishes extensive academic catalogues alongside its exhibitions. It also hosts spaces for discussion and debate, both online and offline.
* [[Virtual Museum of Modern Nigerian Art]] – the VMMNA is the first of its kind in Africa. Hosted by the [[Pan-African University, Lagos]], Nigeria this virtual museum offers a good view of the development on Nigerian Art in the past fifty years.

'''Pathology''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] roots of ''pathos'' ({{lang|grc|πάθος}}), meaning "experience" or "suffering" and ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}), "study of") is  concerned mainly with the [[causal]] study of [[disease]]. 

The word pathology itself may be used broadly to refer to the study of disease in general, incorporating a wide range of [[bioscience]] research fields and medical practices. However, when used in the context of modern medical treatment, the term is often used in a more narrow fashion to refer to processes and tests which fall within the contemporary medical field of "general pathology," an area which includes a number of distinct but inter-related [[medical specialties]] that diagnose disease, mostly through analysis of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], [[human cell|cell]], and [[body fluid]] samples.  Idiomatically, "a pathology" may also refer to the predicted or actual progression of particular diseases (as in the statement "the many different forms of [[cancer]] have diverse pathologies"), and the [[affix]] ''path'' is sometimes used to indicate a state of disease in cases of both physical ailment (as in [[cardiomyopathy]]) and [[psychological]] conditions (such as [[psychopathy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of -path in English|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/--path?q=-path|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=OED|accessdate=12 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017075047/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/--path?q=-path|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[physician]] practicing pathology is called a pathologist.

As a field of general inquiry and research, pathology addresses four components of disease: cause, mechanisms of development ([[pathogenesis]]), structural alterations of cells (morphologic changes), and the consequences of changes (clinical manifestations).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 8th| publisher = Saunders/Elsevier| isbn = 978-1-4160-3121-5| last = Robbins| first = Stanley| title = Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease| location = Philadelphia| date = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In common medical practice, general pathology is mostly concerned with analyzing known clinical abnormalities that are markers or precursors for both [[infectious disease|infectious]] and [[Non-communicable disease|non-infectious]] disease and is conducted by experts in one of two major specialties, [[anatomical pathology]] and [[clinical pathology]].  Further divisions in specialty exist on the basis of the involved sample types (comparing, for example, [[cytopathology]], [[hematopathology]], and [[histopathology]]), organs (as in [[renal pathology]]), and physiological systems ([[oral pathology]]), as well as on the basis of the focus of the examination (as with [[forensic pathology]]).

Pathology is a significant field in modern [[medical diagnosis]] and [[medical research]].

==General medical pathology==

The modern practice of pathology is divided into a number of subdisciplines within the discrete but deeply interconnected aims of biological research and [[medical practice]].  [[Biomedical research]] into disease incorporates the work of a vast variety of life science specialists, whereas, in most parts of the world, to be [[Medical license|licensed]] to practice pathology as medical specialty, one has to complete [[medical school]] and secure a license to practice medicine.  Structurally, the study of disease is divided into many different fields that study or diagnose markers for disease using methods and technologies particular to specific scales, [[organs]], and tissue types.  The information in this section mostly concerns pathology as it regards common medical practice in these systems, but each of these specialties is also the subject of voluminous pathology research as regards the disease pathways of specific pathogens and disorders that affect the tissues of these discrete organs or structures. (See also [[Gross pathology]]).

===Anatomical pathology===
{{Main|Anatomical pathology}}
Anatomical pathology (''Commonwealth'') or anatomic pathology (''United States'') is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the [[gross examination|gross]], [[Histopathology|microscopic]], chemical, immunologic and [[Molecular pathology|molecular]] examination of organs, tissues, and whole bodies (as in a general examination or an [[autopsy]]).  Anatomical pathology is itself divided into subfields, the main divisions being [[surgical pathology]], [[cytopathology]], and [[forensic pathology]]. Anatomical pathology is one of two main divisions of the medical practice of pathology, the other being clinical pathology, the diagnosis of disease through the [[Medical laboratory|laboratory]] analysis of bodily fluids and tissues. Sometimes, pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology, a combination known as general pathology.

====Cytopathology====
{{Main|cytopathology}}

Cytopathology (sometimes referred to as "cytology") is a branch of pathology that studies and diagnoses diseases on the cellular level. It is usually used to aid in the diagnosis of cancer, but also helps in the diagnosis of certain infectious diseases and other inflammatory conditions as well as thyroid lesions, diseases involving sterile body cavities (peritoneal, pleural, and cerebrospinal), and a wide range of other body sites.  Cytopathology is generally used on samples of free cells or tissue fragments (in contrast to histopathology, which studies whole tissues) and cytopathologic tests are sometimes called smear tests because the samples may be smeared across a glass microscope slide for subsequent staining and microscopic examination.  However, cytology samples may be prepared in other ways, including cytocentrifugation.

====Dermatopathology====
{{Main|Dermatopathology}}
[[File:Melanoma.jpg|thumb|225px|right|A [[malignant melanoma]] can often be suspected from sight, but confirmation of the diagnosis or outright removal requires an [[excisional biopsy]].]]
Dermatopathology is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology that focuses on the skin and the rest of the [[integumentary system]] as an organ.  It is unique, in that there are two paths a physician can take to obtain the specialization.  All general pathologists and general dermatologists train in the pathology of the skin, so the term [[dermatopathologist]] denotes either of these who has reached a certainly level of accreditation and experience; in the USA, either a general pathologist or a [[dermatologist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abderm.org/subspecialties/derm.html|title=Dermatopathology|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207093353/http://www.abderm.org/subspecialties/derm.html|archivedate=2010-12-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; can undergo a 1 to 2 year fellowship in the field of dermatopathology.  The completion of this fellowship allows one to take a subspecialty board examination, and becomes a board certified dermatopathologist. Dermatologists are able to recognize most skin diseases based on their appearances, anatomic distributions, and behavior. Sometimes, however, those criteria do not lead to a conclusive diagnosis, and a [[skin biopsy]] is taken to be examined under the microscope using usual histological tests. In some cases, additional specialized testing needs to be performed on biopsies, including [[immunofluorescence]], [[immunohistochemistry]], [[electron microscopy]], [[flow cytometry]], and molecular-pathologic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dermnetnz.org/doctors/dermatopathology/stains.html|title=Special stains and tests – DermNet New Zealand|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520143832/http://dermnetnz.org/doctors/dermatopathology/stains.html|archivedate=2011-05-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the greatest challenges of dermatopathology is its scope. More than 1500 different disorders of the skin exist, including cutaneous eruptions ("[[rashes]]") and [[neoplasms]]. Therefore, dermatopathologists must maintain a broad base of knowledge in clinical dermatology, and be familiar with several other specialty areas in Medicine.

====Forensic pathology====
{{Main|Forensic pathology}}
[[File:Human dissection of the abdominal and toraxic organs.jpg|thumb|Pathologist performing a human dissection of the abdominal and thoracic organs in an autopsy room.]]
Forensic pathology focuses on determining the cause of death by [[post-mortem examination]] of a corpse or partial remains.  An autopsy is typically performed by a coroner or medical examiner, often during criminal investigations; in this role, [[coroner]]s and medical examiners are also frequently asked to confirm the identity of a corpse. The requirements for becoming a licensed practitioner of forensic pathology varies from country to country (and even within a given nation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lett D |title=National standards for forensic pathology training slow to develop |journal=CMAJ |volume=177 |issue=3 |pages=240–1 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17664437 |pmc=1930175 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.070881 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) but typically a minimal requirement is a [[medical doctorate]] with a specialty in general or anatomical pathology with subsequent study in forensic medicine.  The methods forensic scientists use to determine death include examination of tissue specimens to identify the presence or absence of natural disease and other microscopic findings, interpretations of [[toxicology]] on body tissues and fluids to determine the chemical cause of overdoses, poisonings or other cases involving toxic agents, and examinations of [[physical trauma]].  Forensic pathology is a major component in the trans-disciplinary field of [[forensic science]].

====Histopathology====
[[File:Cardiac amyloidosis very high mag movat.jpg|thumb|220px|right|An instance of diagnosis via [[histopathology]], this high-magnification [[micrograph]] of a [[histological section|section]] of cardiac tissue reveals advanced [[cardiac amyloidosis]].  This sample was attained through an [[autopsy]].]]
{{Main|Histopathology}}

Histopathology refers to the microscopic examination of various forms of [[human tissue]].  Specifically, in clinical medicine, histopathology refers to the examination of a biopsy or surgical specimen by a pathologist, after the specimen has been processed and histological sections have been placed onto glass slides.&lt;ref name="Carson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Histotechnology: A Self-Instructional Text |last=Carson |first=Freida L |author2=Christa Hladik |edition=3rd |date=2009 |publisher=[[American Society for Clinical Pathology]] Press |location=Hong Kong |isbn=978-0-89189-581-7 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   This contrasts with the methods of cytopathology, which uses free cells or tissue fragments.  Histopathological examination of tissues starts with [[surgery]], [[biopsy]], or autopsy.  The tissue is removed from the body of an organism and then placed in a fixative that stabilizes the tissues to prevent decay. The most common fixative is [[formalin]], although [[frozen section]] fixing is also common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Wilson LB|title= A method for the rapid preparation of fresh tissues for the microscope|journal=J Am Med Assoc|volume=45 |pages=1737|date= 1905|doi=10.1001/jama.1905.52510230037003c}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To see the tissue under a microscope, the sections are stained with one or more pigments. The aim of staining is to reveal cellular components; counterstains are used to provide contrast.  Histochemistry refers to the science of using chemical reactions between laboratory chemicals and components within tissue.  The histological slides are then interpreted diagnostically and the resulting pathology report describes the histological findings and the opinion of the pathologist.  In the case of cancer, this represents the tissue diagnosis required for most treatment protocols.

====Neuropathology====
{{Main|Neuropathology}}

[[File:AVM grossly.jpg|thumb|230px|This [[Coronal plane|coronal]] [[Microtome|cross-section]] of a brain reveals a significant [[arteriovenous malformation]] that occupies much of the [[parietal lobe]].]]
Neuropathology is the study of disease of nervous system tissue, usually in the form of either surgical biopsies or sometimes whole brains in the case of autopsy. Neuropathology is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology, [[neurology]], and [[neurosurgery]].  In many English-speaking countries, neuropathology is considered a subfield of anatomical pathology.   A physician who specializes in neuropathology, usually by completing a fellowship after a residency in anatomical or general pathology, is called a neuropathologist. In day-to-day clinical practice, a neuropathologist is a consultant for other physicians. If a disease of the nervous system is suspected, and the diagnosis cannot be made by less invasive methods, a biopsy    of nervous tissue is taken from the brain or spinal cord to aid in diagnosis.  Biopsy is usually requested after a mass is detected by [[medical imaging]]. With autopsies, the principal work of the neuropathologist is to help in the post-mortem diagnosis of various conditions that affect the central nervous system.  Biopsies can also consist of the skin. Epidermal nerve fiber density testing (ENFD) is a more recently developed neuropathology test in which a [[Skin biopsy#Punch biopsy|punch skin biopsy]] is taken to identify small fiber [[neuropathies]] by analyzing the nerve fibers of the skin. This test is becoming available in select labs as well as many universities; it replaces the traditional nerve biopsy test as less [[invasive surgery|invasive]].

====Pulmonary pathology====
{{Main|Pulmonary pathology}}
Pulmonary pathology is a subspecialty of anatomic (and especially surgical) pathology that deals with diagnosis and characterization of [[neoplasia|neoplastic]] and non-neoplastic diseases of the [[lung]]s and [[thorax|thoracic]] [[pleura]]. Diagnostic specimens are often obtained via [[bronchoscope|bronchoscopic]] transbronchial biopsy, [[Computed tomography|CT]]-guided percutaneous biopsy, or [[thoracic surgery|video-assisted thoracic surgery]]. These tests can be necessary to diagnose between infection, [[inflammation]], or [[fibrosis|fibrotic]] conditions.
[[File:Polycystic kidneys, gross pathology 20G0027 lores.jpg|thumb|215px|right|This tissue cross-section demonstrates the gross pathology of [[polycystic kidneys]].]]

====Renal pathology====
{{Main|Renal pathology}}

Renal pathology is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology that deals with the diagnosis and characterization of disease of the [[kidney]]s. In a medical setting, renal pathologists work closely with [[nephrology|nephrologists]] and [[organ transplant|transplant surgeons]], who typically obtain diagnostic specimens via percutaneous renal biopsy. The renal pathologist must synthesize findings from traditional microscope histology, [[electron microscopy]], and [[immunofluorescence]] to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Medical renal diseases may affect the [[glomerulus]], the [[tubules]] and [[interstitium]], the vessels, or a combination of these compartments.

====Surgical pathology====
{{Main|Surgical pathology}}

Surgical pathology is one of the primary areas of practice for most anatomical pathologists. Surgical pathology involves the gross and microscopic examination of surgical specimens, as well as biopsies submitted by surgeons and non-surgeons such as [[internal medicine|general internists]], [[Medical specialties|medical subspecialists]], [[dermatologists]], and [[radiology|interventional radiologists]].  Often an [[Surgery#Types of surgery|excised]] [[tissue sample]] is the best and most definitive evidence of disease (or lack thereof) in cases where tissue is surgically removed from a patient.  These determinations are usually accomplished by a combination of gross (i.e., macroscopic) and histologic (i.e., microscopic) examination of the tissue, and may involve evaluations of molecular properties of the tissue by immunohistochemistry or other laboratory tests.

[[File:Brain biopsy under stereotaxy.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Brain biopsy]] under [[stereotaxy]]. A small part of the tumor is taken via a needle with a vacuum system.]]
There are two major types of specimens submitted for surgical pathology analysis: biopsies and surgical resections.  A biopsy is a small piece of tissue removed primarily for surgical pathology analysis, most often in order to render a definitive diagnosis. Types of biopsies include core biopsies, which are obtained through the use of large-bore needles, sometimes under the guidance of radiological techniques such as [[ultrasound]], [[CT scan]], or [[magnetic resonance imaging]].  Incisional biopsies are obtained through diagnostic surgical procedures that remove part of a suspicious [[lesion]], whereas excisional biopsies remove the entire lesion, and are similar to therapeutic surgical resections. Excisional biopsies of [[skin lesions]] and [[gastrointestinal]] [[polyps]] are very common. The pathologist's interpretation of a biopsy is critical to establishing the diagnosis of a benign or malignant tumor, and can differentiate between different types and grades of cancer, as well as determining the activity of specific molecular pathways in the tumor. Surgical resection specimens are obtained by the therapeutic surgical removal of an entire diseased area or organ (and occasionally multiple organs). These procedures are often intended as definitive surgical treatment of a disease in which the diagnosis is already known or strongly suspected, but pathological analysis of these specimens remains important in confirming the previous diagnosis.

===Clinical pathology===
{{Main|Clinical pathology}}

Clinical pathology is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the [[Medical laboratory|laboratory]] analysis of bodily fluids such as blood and [[urine]], as well as tissues, using the tools of [[clinical chemistry|chemistry]], [[clinical microbiology]], [[hematology]] and molecular pathology.  Clinical pathologists work in close collaboration with [[medical technologist]]s, hospital administrations, and referring physicians. Clinical pathologists learn to administer a number of visual and microscopic tests and an especially large variety of tests of the [[biophysical]] properties of tissue samples involving [[Automated analyser]]s and [[Microbiological culture|culture]]s.  Sometimes the general term "laboratory medicine specialist" is used to refer to those working in clinical pathology, including medical doctors, Ph.D.s and doctors of pharmacology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://txpefcc.omega-box.de/file_download/72/EFCC+Newsletter+2011-05.pdf|title="Laboratory medicine specialist in EFcC newsletter may 2011 (page 5)|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427093647/http://txpefcc.omega-box.de/file_download/72/EFCC+Newsletter+2011-05.pdf|archivedate=2014-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immunopathology]], the study of an organism's immune response to infection, is sometimes considered to fall within the domain of clinical pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/2003/32/MENS0301444A.htm|title=Bulletin officiel du n°32 du 4 septembre 2003 – MENS0301444A|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302102242/http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/2003/32/MENS0301444A.htm|archivedate=2008-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Konelab60i.png|thumb|225px|right|[[Clinical chemistry]]: an [[automated analyzer|automated blood chemistry analyzer]]]]

====Hematopathology====
{{Main|Hematopathology}}
Hematopathology is the study of diseases of blood cells (including constituents such as [[white blood cells]], [[red blood cells]], and [[platelets]]) and the tissues, and organs comprising 
the hematopoietic system. The term hematopoietic system refers to tissues and organs that produce and/or primarily host hematopoietic cells and includes [[bone marrow]], the [[lymph nodes]], [[thymus]], [[spleen]], and other lymphoid tissues.  In the United States, hematopathology is a board certified subspecialty (licensed under the American Board of Pathology) practiced by those physicians who have completed a general pathology residency (anatomic, clinical, or combined) and an additional year of fellowship training in hematology. The hematopathologist reviews biopsies of lymph nodes, bone marrows and other tissues involved by an [[Infiltration (medical)|infiltrate]] of cells of the hematopoietic system. In addition, the hematopathologist may be in charge of flow cytometric and/or molecular hematopathology studies.

====Immunopathology====
{{Main|Immunopathology}}
Immunopathology is a branch of clinical pathology that deals with an organism’s immune response to a certain disease. When a foreign antigen enters the body, there is either an antigen specific or nonspecific response to it. These responses are the immune system fighting off the foreign antigens, whether they are deadly or not. Immunopathology could refer to how the foreign antigens cause the immune system to have a response or problems that can arise from an organism’s own immune response on itself. There are certain problems or faults in the immune system that can lead to more serious illness or disease. These diseases can come from one of the following problems. The first would be Hypersensitivity reactions, where there would be a stronger immune response than normal. There are four different types (type one, two, three and four), all with varying types and degrees of an immune response. The problems that arise from each type vary from small allergic reactions to more serious illnesses such as tuberculosis or arthritis. The second kind of complication in the immune system is Autoimmunity, where the immune system would attack itself rather than the antigen. Inflammation is a prime example of autoimmunity, as the immune cells used are self-reactive. A few examples of autoimmune diseases are Type 1 diabetes, Addison’s disease and Celiac disease. The third and final type of complication with the immune system is Immunodeficiency, where the immune system lacks the ability to fight off a certain disease. The immune system’s ability to combat it is either hindered or completely absent. The two types are Primary Immunodeficiency, where the immune system is either missing a key component or does not function properly, and Secondary Immunodeficiency, where disease is obtained from an outside source, like radiation or heat, and therefore cannot function properly. Diseases that can cause immunodeficiency include HIV, AIDS and leukemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An introduction to immunology and immunopathology|first1=Richard|last1=Warrington|first2=Wade|last2=Watson|first3=Harold L.|last3=Kim|first4=Francesca Romana|last4=Antonetti|date=1 January 2011|journal=Allergy, Asthma &amp; Clinical Immunology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=S1|doi=10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S1|pmid=22165815|pmc=3245432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warrington|first1=Richard|title=An introduction to immunology and immunopathology|journal=Allergy, Asthma &amp; Clinical Immunology|volume=7|pages=S1|df=|doi=10.1186/1710-1492-7-S1-S1|pmid=22165815|pmc=3245432|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Radiation pathology ====
Radiation pathology is study of the interaction between human tissues and radiation, as well as the problems and diseases that can arise from the use of radiation. When human tissue is exposed to radiation, it can be genetically altered and deformed; in turn, this could lead to a variety of illnesses that could be minor or deadly.&lt;ref&gt;[1] Fajardo, Luis Felipe., Morgan Berthrong, and Robert E. Anderon. ''Radiation Pathology.'' New York: Oxford UP, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular pathology===
{{Main|Molecular pathology}}
Molecular pathology is focused upon the study and diagnosis of disease through the examination of molecules within organs, tissues or [[bodily fluids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The molecular pathology of cancer|author=Harris TJ|author2=McCormick F. |date=2010|journal=Nat Rev Clin Oncol|volume=7|issue=5|pages=251–265|pmid=20351699|doi=10.1038/nrclinonc.2010.41|pmc=2222796}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Molecular pathology is multidisciplinary by nature and shares some aspects of practice with both anatomic pathology and clinical pathology, [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], [[proteomics]] and [[genetics]].  It is often applied in a context that is as much scientific as directly medical and encompasses the development of molecular and genetic approaches to the diagnosis and classification of human diseases, the design and validation of predictive biomarkers for treatment response and disease progression, and the susceptibility of individuals of different genetic constitution to particular disorders.  The crossover between molecular pathology and [[epidemiology]] is represented by a related field "[[molecular pathological epidemiology]]".

===Oral and maxillofacial pathology===
{{main|Oral and maxillofacial pathology}}

Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology is one of nine dental specialties recognized by the [[American Dental Association]], and is sometimes considered a specialty of both dentistry and pathology.&lt;ref name="Neville 2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Neville BW|author2=Damm DD|author3=Allen CA|author4=Bouquot JE|last-author-amp=yes|title=Oral &amp; maxillofacial pathology|date=2002|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia?page=ix (preface)|isbn=0721690033|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Oral Pathologists must complete three years of post doctoral training in an accredited program and subsequently obtain diplomate status from the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology. The specialty focuses on the diagnosis, clinical management and investigation of diseases that affect the oral cavity and surrounding maxillofacial structures including but not limited to [[odontogenic]], infectious, [[epithelial]], [[salivary gland]], [[bone]] and [[soft tissue]] pathologies.  It also significantly intersects with the field of [[dental pathology]].  Although concerned with a broad variety of diseases of the oral cavity, they have roles distinct from [[otorhinolaryngology|otorhinolaryngologists]] ("ear, nose, and throat" specialists), and [[Speech pathology|speech pathologists]], the latter of which helps diagnose many neurological or [[neuromuscular]] conditions relevant to [[Phonology|speech phonology]] or [[swallowing]].  Owing to the availability of the [[oral cavity]] to non-invasive examination, many conditions in the study of oral disease can be diagnosed, or at least suspected, from gross examination, but biopsies, cell smears, and other tissue analysis remain important diagnostic tools in oral pathology.

==Medical training and accreditation==
{{Main|Medical specialty}}

Individual nations vary some in the [[medical licensing]] required of pathologists.  In the United States, pathologists are physicians ([[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]] or [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]) that have completed a four-year undergraduate program, four years of medical school training, and three to four years of postgraduate training in the form of a pathology [[medical residency|residency]]. Training may be within two primary specialties, as recognized by the American Board of Pathology: [[anatomical Pathology]] and [[clinical Pathology]], each of which requires separate board certification. The [[American Osteopathic Board of Pathology]] also recognizes four primary specialties: anatomic pathology, dermatopathology, forensic pathology, and [[laboratory medicine]].  Pathologists may pursue specialised fellowship training within one or more subspecialties of either anatomical or clinical pathology. Some of these subspecialties permit additional board certification, while others do not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abpath.org/default.aspx Homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630171453/http://www.abpath.org/default.aspx |date=2007-06-30 }} of the American Board of Pathology&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UNDmicroscope.jpg|thumb|225px|An anatomical pathology instructor uses a microscope with multiple eyepieces to instruct students in diagnostic microscopy.]]
In the United Kingdom, pathologists are physicians licensed by the UK [[General Medical Council]]. The training to become a pathologist is under the oversight of the [[Royal College of Pathologists]]. After four to six years of undergraduate medical study, trainees proceed to a two-year foundation program. Full-time training in histopathology currently lasts between five and five and a half years and includes specialist training in surgical pathology, cytopathology, and autopsy pathology.  It is also possible to take a [[Royal College of Pathologists]] diploma in forensic pathology, dermatopathology, or cytopathology, recognising additional specialist training and expertise and to get specialist accreditation in forensic pathology, [[pediatric pathology]], and neuropathology.  All postgraduate medical training and education in the UK is overseen by the General Medical Council.

In France, Pathology is separate in two distinct specialties, anatomical pathology and clinical pathology. Residencies for both lasts four years. Residency in anatomical pathology is open to physicians only, while clinical pathology is open to both physicians and [[pharmacist]]s. At the end of the second year of clinical pathology residency, residents can choose between general clinical pathology and a specialization in one of the disciplines, but they can not practice anatomical pathology, nor can anatomical pathology residents practice clinical pathology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sante.gouv.fr/adm/dagpb/bo/2003/03-05/a0050272.htm ''Reglementation'' for French Residency in Clinical Pathology (Biologie médicale)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228225540/http://www.sante.gouv.fr/adm/dagpb/bo/2003/03-05/a0050272.htm |date=2008-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/2003/32/MENS0301444A.htm|title=Bulletin officiel du n°32 du 4 septembre 2003 – MENS0301444A|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302102242/http://www.education.gouv.fr/bo/2003/32/MENS0301444A.htm|archivedate=2008-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overlap with other diagnostic medicine==
{{Main|Diagnostic medicine|Oncology|Infectious disease|Medical imaging}}

Though separate fields in terms of medical practice, a number of areas of inquiry in medicine and
medical science either overlap greatly with general pathology, work in tandem with it, or contribute significantly to the understanding of the pathology of a given disease or its course in an individual.  As a significant portion of all general pathology practice is concerned with [[cancer]], the practice of [[oncology]] is deeply tied to, and dependent upon, the work of both anatomical and clinical pathologists.&lt;ref name="Cancer.Net"&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Oncologists|url=http://www.cancer.net/all-about-cancer/newly-diagnosed/find-oncologist/types-oncologists|publisher=Cancer.Net : American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)|accessdate=25 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601155338/http://www.cancer.net/all-about-cancer/newly-diagnosed/find-oncologist/types-oncologists|archivedate=1 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biopsy, [[segmental resection|resection]] and blood tests are all examples of pathology work that is essential for the diagnoses of many kinds of cancer and for the [[cancer staging|staging]] of [[Cancerous tumor|cancerous masses]].  In a similar fashion, the tissue and blood analysis techniques of general pathology are of central significance to the investigation of serious [[infectious disease (medical specialty)|infectious disease]] and as such inform significantly upon the fields of [[epidemiology]], [[etiology (medicine)|etiology]], [[immunology]], and [[parasitology]].  General pathology methods are of great importance to biomedical research into disease, wherein they are sometimes referred to as [[experimental pathology|"experimental" or "investigative" pathology]].

[[Medical imaging]] is the generating of visual representations of the interior of a body for clinical analysis and medical intervention. Medical imaging reveals details of [[internal medicine|internal]] physiology that help medical professionals plan appropriate treatments for tissue infection and trauma.  Medical imaging is also central in supplying the [[biometric]] data necessary to establish baseline features of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] so as to increase the accuracy with which early or fine-detail abnormalities are detected.  These diagnostic techniques are often performed in combination with general pathology procedures and are themselves often essential to developing new understanding of the [[pathogenesis]] of a given disease and tracking the progress of disease in specific medical cases.  Examples of important subdivisions in medical imaging include [[radiology]] (which uses the imaging technologies of X-ray [[radiography]]) [[magnetic resonance imaging]],  [[medical ultrasonography]] (or ultrasound), [[endoscopy]], [[elastography]], [[tactile imaging]], [[thermography]], [[medical photography]], [[nuclear medicine]] and [[functional imaging]] techniques such as [[positron emission tomography]].  Though they do not strictly relay images, readings from diagnostics tests involving [[electroencephalography]], [[magnetoencephalography]], and [[electrocardiography]] often give hints as to the state and function of certain tissues in the brain and heart respectively.

==Psychopathology==
{{Main|Psychopathology}}

Psychopathology is the study of [[mental illness]], particularly of severe disorders.  Informed heavily by both [[psychology]] and [[neurology]], its purpose is to classify mental illness, elucidate its underlying causes, and guide clinical [[psychiatric]] treatment accordingly.  Although diagnosis and classification of mental norms and disorders is largely the purview of psychiatry—the results of which are guidelines such as the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], which attempt to classify mental disease mostly on behavioural evidence, though not without controversy&lt;ref name=frana&gt;{{cite web |url=http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1688399 |title=The New Crisis in Confidence in Psychiatric Diagnosis |author=Allen Frances |author-link=Allen Frances |date=17 May 2013 |work=Annals of Internal Medicine |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607183245/http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1688399 |archivedate=7 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="concept&amp;evolution"&gt;Dalal PK, Sivakumar T.

Mental or social disorders or behaviours seen as generally unhealthy or excessive in a given individual, to the point where they cause harm or severe disruption to the sufferer's lifestyle, are often called "pathological" (e.g., [[pathological gambling]] or [[pathological liar]]).

==History==
{{Main|History of medicine}}

[[File:Gorman and Feeley.jpg|thumb|260px|The advent of the microscope was one of the major developments in the history of pathology.  Here researchers at the [[Centers for Disease Control]] in 1978 examine cultures containing ''Legionella pneumophila'', the pathogen responsible for [[Legionnaire's disease]].]]
The study of pathology, including the detailed examination of the body, including dissection and inquiry into specific maladies, dates back to antiquity.  Rudimentary understanding of many conditions was present in most early societies and is attested to in the records of the earliest [[historical era|historical societies]], including those of the [[Middle East]], [[India]], and [[China]].&lt;ref name="Long1965"&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=Esmond|title=History of Pathology|date=1965|publisher=Dover|location=New York|isbn=0-486-61342-9|pages=1+}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Hellenic period]] of [[ancient Greece]], a concerted causal study of disease was underway (see [[Medicine in ancient Greece]]), with many notable early physicians (such as [[Hippocrates]], for whom the modern [[Hippocratic Oath]] is named) having developed methods of [[diagnosis]] and [[prognosis]] for a number of diseases.[[Medicine in ancient Rome|The medical practices of the Romans]] and [[Byzantine medicine|those of the Byzantines]] continued from these Greek roots, but, as with many areas of scientific inquiry, growth in understanding of medicine stagnated some after the [[Classical antiquity|Classical Era]], but continued to slowly develop throughout numerous cultures.  Notably, many advances were made in the medieval era of Islam (see [[Medicine in medieval Islam]]), during which numerous texts of complex pathologies were developed, also based on the Greek tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Commentary on the Chapter Nine of the Book of Medicine Dedicated to Mansur&amp;nbsp;— Commentaria in nonum librum Rasis ad regem Almansorem| work = World Digital Library| language = Latin| accessdate = 2014-03-02| date = 1542| url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/10672/| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140214144236/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/10672/| archivedate = 2014-02-14| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, growth in complex understanding of disease mostly languished until knowledge and experimentation again began to proliferate in the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]], [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and [[Baroque Era|Baroque]] eras, following the resurgence of the empirical method at new centers of scholarship.  By the 17th century, the study of microscopy was underway and examination of tissues had led [[British Royal Society]] member [[Robert Hooke]] to coin the word "[[Cell (biology)|cell]]", setting the stage for later [[germ theory]].

Modern pathology began to develop as a distinct field of inquiry during the 19th Century through [[natural philosophers]] and physicians that studied disease and the informal study of what they termed “pathological anatomy” or “morbid anatomy”.  However, pathology as a formal area of specialty was not fully developed until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the advent of detailed study of [[microbiology]]. In the 19th century, physicians had begun to understand that disease-causing pathogens, or "germs" (a catch-all for disease-causing, or pathogenic, microbes, such as [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[fungi]], [[amoebae]], [[molds]], [[protist]]s, and [[prion]]s) existed and were capable of reproduction and multiplication, replacing earlier beliefs in [[humors]] or even spiritual agents, that had dominated for much of the previous 1,500 years in European medicine.  With the new understanding of causative agents, physicians began to compare the characteristics of one germ’s symptoms as they developed within an affected individual to another germ’s characteristics and symptoms. This realization led to the foundational understanding that diseases are able to replicate themselves, and that they can have many profound and varied effects on the human host. To determine causes of diseases, medical experts used the most common and widely accepted assumptions or symptoms of their times, a general principal of approach that persists into modern medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Lester|title=Transformations in American Medicine: From Benjamin Rush to William Osler|date=1991|publisher=Johns Hopkins UP|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-4057-0|pages=27+}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Machevsky|first=Alberto|title=Evidence-based Medicine, Medical Decision Analysis, and Pathology|journal=Human Pathology|date=2004|volume=35|issue=10|pages=1179–88|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0046817704003430|accessdate=21 March 2012|doi=10.1016/j.humpath.2004.06.004|pmid=15492984|last2=Wick|first2=MR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern medicine was particularly advanced by further developments of the microscope to analyze tissues, to which [[Rudolf Virchow]] gave a significant contribution, leading to a slew of research developments.
By the late 1920s to early 1930s pathology was deemed a medical specialty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothstein|first=William G.|title=Pathology: The Evolution of a Specialty in American Medicine|journal=Medical Care|date=1979|volume=17|issue=10|pages= 975+|jstor=3763869|doi=10.1097/00005650-197910000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with developments in the understanding of general [[physiology]], by the beginning of the 20th century, the study of pathology had begun to split into a number of rarefied fields and resulting in the development of large number of modern specialties within pathology and related disciplines of [[diagnostic medicine]].

==Non-humans==

[[File:Enzootic pneumonia ewe.jpg|thumb|185px|This field [[post-mortem]] of a [[Sheep|ewe]] has revealed [[lesions]] consistent with acute [[haemolytic]] [[pneumonia]], possibly due to ''Pasteurella haemolytica''.]]
Although the vast majority of lab work and research in pathology concerns the development of disease in humans, pathology is of significance throughout the biological sciences. Two main catch-all fields exist to represent most complex organisms capable of serving as host to a pathogen or other form of disease: veterinary pathology (concerned with all non-human species of [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] of [[Animalia]]) and [[phytopathology]], which studies disease in plants.

===Veterinary ===
{{Main|Veterinary pathology|Animal testing}}

Veterinary pathology covers a vast array of species, but with a significantly smaller number of practitioners, so understanding of disease in non-human animals, especially as regards [[veterinarian|veterinary practice]],  varies considerably by species.  Nonetheless, significant amounts of pathology research are conducted on animals, for two primary reasons: 1) The origins of diseases are typically [[zoonotic]] in nature, and many infectious pathogens have animal vectors and, as such, understanding the mechanisms of action for these pathogens in non-human hosts is essential to the understanding and application of [[epidemiology]] and 2) those animals that share physiological and genetic traits with humans can be used as surrogates for the study of the disease and potential treatments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acvp.org/public/WhatIsVetPath.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024125740/http://www.acvp.org/public/WhatIsVetPath.cfm |archivedate=October 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the effects of various synthetic products. For this reason, as well as their roles as [[livestock]] and [[companion animals]], [[mammals]] generally have the largest body of research in veterinary pathology. Animal testing remains a controversial practice, even in cases where it is used to research treatment for human disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rollin |first1=Bernard E. |title=The Regulation of Animal Research and the Emergence of Animal Ethics: A Conceptual History |journal=Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics |volume=27 |pages=285–304 |date=2006 |doi=10.1007/s11017-006-9007-8 | pmid=16937023 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As in human medical pathology, the practice of veterinary pathology is customarily divided into the two main fields of anatomical and clinical pathology.

===Plants===
{{Main|Plant pathology}}

Although the pathogens and their mechanics differ greatly from those of animals, plants are subject to a wide variety of diseases, including those caused by [[fungi]], [[oomycete]]s, [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[viroid]]s, virus-like organisms, [[phytoplasma]]s, [[protozoa]], [[nematode]]s and [[parasitic plant]]s.  Damage caused by [[insects]], [[mite]]s, [[vertebrate]], and other small herbivores is not considered a part of the domain of plant pathology. The field is deeply connected to [[plant disease epidemiology]] and the [[horticulture]] of species that are of high importance to the [[human diet]] or other uses.

In [[biology]], '''photophobia''' (adjective: '''photophobic''') refers to negative response to light.

Photophobia is a behavior demonstrated by insects or other animals which seek to stay out of the light.

In [[botany]], the term photophobia/photophobic describes shade-loving plants that thrive in low light conditions. 

Photophobia (or photophobic response) may also refer to a negative [[phototaxis]] or [[phototropism]] response.

There are several definitions for '''professional abuse''' and distinctions are usually pronounced in definitions according to professional fields. One of the general descriptions, however, that sought to bridge the variations was put forward by the National Council of Psychotherapists, which explained professional abuse as a violation of an organization's [[Ethical code|code of ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://natcouncilofpsychotherapists.org.uk/Newsletter/Ed001/Professional_Abuse.html|title=Professional Abuse|last=O'Sullivan|first=Michael|date=|website=natcouncilofpsychotherapists.org.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources refer to this as standards of behavior, which include the maintenance of [[professional boundaries]] and the treatment of people with respect and dignity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/guides-to-support-and-services/abuse/abuse-by-health-and-social-care-workers/#.W2mcjNIzbDd|title=Abuse by health and social care workers {{!}} Mind, the mental health charity - help for mental health problems|website=www.mind.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more comprehensive version of this description states that this type of abuse is "a pattern of conduct in which a person abuses, violates, or takes advantage of a victim within the context of the abuser's profession."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-professional-abuse.htm|title=What Is Professional Abuse?|work=wiseGEEK|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional abusers are the individuals who prey on the weaknesses of others in their workplaces or in other places related to economical strands of society. Their fundamental behavior is based in the following actions:

* taking advantage of their client or patient's [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]]
* exploiting their [[vulnerability]]
* not acting in their best interests
* failing to keep [[professional boundaries]]

== Forms of abuse ==
There are many forms of abuse. It may be:
* [[discriminatory]]
* [[Abuse#Financial abuse|financial]]
* [[physical abuse|physical]]
* [[psychological abuse|psychological]]
* [[sexual abuse|sexual]]

Professional abuse always involves:
* [[betrayal]]
* [[wikt:exploit|exploitation]]
* violation of professional boundaries

Professionals can abuse in three ways:
* [[nonfeasance]] - ignore and take no indicated action - neglect.
* [[misfeasance]] - take inappropriate action or give intentionally incorrect advice.
* [[malfeasance]] - hostile, aggressive action taken to injure the client's interests.

== Solutions ==
There are several strategies available to organizations seeking to address professional abuse. A study, for instance, revealed that this problem often arises when there is an extreme power imbalance between the professional and the victim. A framework based on different grades of client empowerment and ways of strengthening it can help solve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=S.|date=2000|title=Client empowerment in psychiatry and the professional abuse of clients: where do we stand?|journal=International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine|volume=30|issue=1|pages=61–70|doi=10.2190/AC9N-YTLE-B639-M3P4|issn=0091-2174|pmid=10900561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have been subjected to professional abuse could also pursue any of the following courses of actions: lodging a complaint; reporting abuse to the police; and, taking legal action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are also organizations that can help those who are victimized learn more about their rights and the options available to them.

'''Renaissance architecture''' is the European architecture of the period between the early 14th and early 17th centuries in different&lt;!---leave this word---&gt; regions, demonstrating a conscious revival and development of certain elements of [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] thought and material culture. Stylistically, Renaissance architecture followed [[Gothic architecture]] and was succeeded by [[Baroque architecture]].  Developed first in [[Florence]], with [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] as one of its innovators, the Renaissance style quickly spread to other Italian cities. The style was carried to France, Germany, England, Russia and other parts of Europe at different dates and with varying degrees of impact.

Renaissance style places emphasis on [[symmetry]], [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]], [[geometry]] and the regularity of parts, as they are demonstrated in the architecture of [[classical antiquity]] and in particular ancient [[Roman architecture]], of which many examples remained. Orderly arrangements of [[column]]s, [[pilaster]]s and [[Lintel|lintels]], as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical [[dome]]s, [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] and [[aedicula]] replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of [[Gothic architecture|medieval]] buildings.

==Historiography==
The word "Renaissance" derived from the term ''"la rinascita"'', which means rebirth, first appeared in Giorgio Vasari's ''Vite de' più eccellenti architetti, pittori, et scultori Italiani'' The Lives of the Artists, 1550–60.

Although the term Renaissance was used first by the French historian Jules Michelet, it was given its more lasting definition from the Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt, whose book, ''Die Kultur der Renaissance in Italien'' 1860, The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, 1860, English translation, by SGC Middlemore, in 2 vols., London, 1878) was influential in the development of the modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance. The folio of measured drawings ''Édifices de Rome moderne; ou, Recueil des palais, maisons, églises, couvents et autres monuments'' (The Buildings of Modern Rome), first published in 1840 by Paul Letarouilly, also played an important part in the revival of interest in this period.Erwin Panofsky, ''Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art'', (New York: Harper and Row, 1960) The Renaissance style was recognized by contemporaries in the term ''"all'antica"'', or "in the ancient manner" (of the Romans).

==Development in Italy – influences==
{{Main|Italian Renaissance}}
Italy of the 15th century, and the city of Florence 
in particular, was home to the Renaissance. It is in Florence that the new architectural style had its beginning, not slowly evolving in the way that [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] grew out of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], but consciously brought to being by particular architects who sought to revive the order of a past "[[Golden Age]]". The scholarly approach to the architecture of the ancient coincided with the general revival of learning. A number of factors were influential in bringing this about.

[[File:Baptisteriumganz.jpg|thumb|left|The Romanesque Baptistery of Florence was the object of Brunelleschi's studies of perspective]]

===Architectural===

Italian architects had always preferred forms that were clearly defined and structural members that expressed their purpose.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; Many Tuscan Romanesque buildings demonstrate these characteristics, as seen in the Florence Baptistery and Pisa Cathedral.

Italy had never fully adopted the Gothic style of architecture. Apart from the [[Cathedral of Milan]], (influenced by French Rayonnant Gothic), few Italian churches show the emphasis on vertical, the clustered shafts, ornate tracery and complex ribbed vaulting that characterise Gothic in other parts of Europe.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

The presence, particularly in Rome, of ancient architectural remains showing the ordered [[Classical style]] provided an inspiration to artists at a time when philosophy was also turning towards the Classical.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

===Political===

In the 15th century, [[Florence]], [[Venice]] and [[Naples]] extended their power through much of the area that surrounded them, making the movement of artists possible. This enabled Florence to have significant artistic influence in [[Milan]], and through Milan, [[France]].

In 1377, the return of the Pope from the [[Avignon Papacy]]&lt;ref&gt;Joëlle Rollo-Koster, ''Raiding Saint Peter: Empty Sees, Violence, and the Initiation of the Great Western Schism (1378)'', (Brill, 2008), 182.&lt;/ref&gt; and the re-establishment of the [[Papal court]] in Rome, brought wealth and importance to that city, as well as a renewal in the importance of the Pope in Italy, which was further strengthened by the [[Council of Constance]] in 1417. Successive Popes, especially [[Julius II]], 1503–13, sought to extend the Pope’s [[Papal states|temporal power]] throughout Italy.&lt;ref name=A.M&gt;Andrew Martindale, ''Man and the Renaissance'', 1966, Paul Hamlyn, ISBN unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial===

In the early Renaissance, [[Venice]] controlled sea trade over goods from the East. The large towns of [[Northern Italy]] were prosperous through trade with the rest of Europe, [[Genoa]] providing a seaport for the goods of France and Spain; [[Milan]] and [[Turin]] being centers of overland trade, and maintaining substantial metalworking industries.
Trade brought wool from England to Florence, ideally located on the river for the production of fine cloth, the industry on which its wealth was founded. By dominating [[Pisa]], Florence gained a seaport, and also maintained dominance of Genoa.
In this commercial climate, one family in particular turned their attention from trade to the lucrative business of money-lending. The [[House of Medici|Medici]] became the chief bankers to the princes of Europe, becoming virtually princes themselves as they did so, by reason of both wealth and influence.
Along the trade routes, and thus offered some protection by commercial interest, moved not only goods but also artists, scientists and philosophers.&lt;ref name=A.M /&gt;

[[File:Melozzo da Forlì 001.jpg|thumb|Pope Sixtus IV, 1477, builder of the Sistine Chapel. Fresco by [[Melozzo da Forlì]] in the [[Vatican Palace]].]]

===Religious===

The return of the [[Pope Gregory XI]] from [[Avignon]] in September 1377 and the resultant new emphasis on [[Rome]] as the center of [[Christianity|Christian]] spirituality, brought about a boom in the building of churches in Rome such as had not taken place for nearly a thousand years. This commenced in the mid 15th century and gained momentum in the 16th century, reaching its peak in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] period. The construction of the [[Sistine Chapel]] with its uniquely important decorations and the entire rebuilding of St Peter's, one of Christendom's most significant churches, were part of this process.&lt;ref name= I.R.&gt;Ilan Rachum, ''The Renaissance, an Illustrated Encyclopedia'', 1979, Octopus, {{ISBN|0-7064-0857-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In wealthy republican Florence, the impetus for church-building was more civic than spiritual. The unfinished state of the enormous cathedral dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] did no honour to the city under her patronage. However, as the technology and finance were found to complete it, the rising dome did credit not only to the Blessed Virgin, its architect and the Church but also the Signoria, the Guilds and the sectors of the city from which the manpower to construct it was drawn. The dome inspired further religious works in Florence.

===Philosophic===

The development of printed books, the rediscovery of ancient writings, the expanding of political and trade contacts and the exploration of the world all increased knowledge and the desire for education.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

The reading of philosophies that were not based on Christian theology led to the development of [[Humanism]] through which it was clear that while God had established and maintained order in the Universe, it was the role of Man to establish and maintain order in Society.&lt;ref&gt;J.R.Hale, ''Renaissance Europe, 1480–1520'', 1971, Fontana {{ISBN|0-00-632435-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jacopo Pontormo 055.jpg|thumb|[[Cosimo de' Medici the Elder]], head of the Medici Bank, sponsored civic building programs. Posthumous portrait by [[Pontormo]].]]

===Civil===

Through [[Humanism]], civic pride and the promotion of civil peace and order were seen as the marks of citizenship. This led to the building of structures such as Brunelleschi's [[Ospedale degli Innocenti|Hospital of the Innocents]] with its elegant colonnade forming a link between the charitable building and the public square, and the [[Laurentian Library]] where the collection of books established by the Medici family could be consulted by scholars.&lt;ref name= Gardner&gt;[[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]], ''Art Through the Ages'', 5th edition, Harcourt, Brace and World.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some major ecclesiastical building works were also commissioned, not by the church, but by guilds representing the wealth and power of the city. Brunelleschi’s dome at [[Florence Cathedral]], more than any other building, belonged to the populace because the construction of each of the eight segments was achieved by a different sector of the city.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name= Gardner /&gt;

===Patronage===

As in the [[Plato|Platonic academy]] of [[Athens]], it was seen by those of Humanist understanding that those people who had the benefit of wealth and education ought to promote the pursuit of learning and the creation of that which was beautiful. To this end, wealthy families—the [[Medici]] of Florence, the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] of Mantua, the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] in Rome, the [[House of Sforza|Sforzas]] in Milan—gathered around them people of learning and ability, promoting the skills and creating employment for the most talented artists and architects of their day.&lt;ref name= Gardner /&gt;

===Architectural theory===
{{further|Mathematics and architecture}}

During the Renaissance, architecture became not only a question of practice, but also a matter for theoretical discussion. [[Printing]] played a large role in the dissemination of ideas.
* The first treatise on architecture was ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' ("On the Subject of Building") by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] in 1450. It was to some degree dependent on [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'', a manuscript of which was discovered in 1414 in a library in Switzerland. ''De re aedificatoria'' in 1485 became the first printed book on architecture.
* [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475 – c. 1554) produced the next important text, the first volume of which appeared in Venice in 1537; it was entitled ''Regole generali d'architettura'' ("General Rules of Architecture"). It is known as Serlio's "Fourth Book" since it was the fourth in Serlio's original plan of a treatise in seven books. In all, five books were published.
* In 1570, [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–1580) published ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' ("The Four Books of Architecture") in [[Venice]]. This book was widely printed and responsible to a great degree for spreading the ideas of the Renaissance through Europe. All these books were intended to be read and studied not only by architects, but also by patrons.

==Principal phases==
[[File:PalladioBramanteTempietto1570.jpg|thumb|upright|Palladio's engraving of Bramante's Tempietto]]
[[File:Tempietto - Houtsnede door Palladio 2.jpeg|thumb|upright|Plan of Bramante's Tempietto in Montorio]]

Historians often divide the Renaissance in Italy into three phases.&lt;ref&gt;Some architectural histories e.g. Sir [[Banister Fletcher]], include Baroque as a phase of Renaissance architecture. Because of its extent, diversity and deviation from the Classical it is not included here and is the subject of a main article.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas art historians might talk of an "Early Renaissance" period, in which they include developments in 14th-century painting and sculpture, this is usually not the case in architectural history. The bleak economic conditions of the late 14th century did not produce buildings that are considered to be part of the Renaissance. As a result, the word "Renaissance" among architectural historians usually applies to the period 1400 to ca. 1525, or later in the case of non-Italian Renaissances.

Historians often use the following designations:
* Renaissance (ca. 1400–1500); also known as the [[Quattrocento]]&lt;ref&gt;The Italian translates literally to "fourteen-hundred" and coincides with the English "fifteenth century".&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes Early Renaissance&lt;ref&gt;The ''Early Renaissance'' in architecture is most applicable to developments in Venice, where there was a more fluid development between medieval and Renaissance styles than in Florence. See: John McAndrew ''Venetian Architecture of the Early Renaissance'' (Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[High Renaissance]] (ca.1500–1525)
* [[Mannerism]] (ca. 1520–1600)

===Quattrocento===

In the ''Quattrocento'', concepts of architectural order were explored and rules were formulated. (See- Characteristics of Renaissance Architecture, below.) The study of classical antiquity led in particular to the adoption of Classical detail and ornamentation.

Space, as an element of architecture, was used differently from the way it had been in the [[Middle Ages]]. Space was organised by proportional logic, its form and rhythm subject to geometry, rather than being created by intuition as in Medieval buildings. The prime example of this is the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|Basilica di San Lorenzo]] in [[Florence]] by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] (1377–1446).&lt;ref&gt;Howard Saalman. ''Filippo Brunelleschi: The Buildings''. (London: Zwemmer, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

===High Renaissance===

During the ''[[High Renaissance]]'', concepts derived from classical antiquity were developed and used with greater confidence. The most representative architect is [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]] (1444–1514) who expanded the applicability of classical architecture to contemporary buildings. His [[San Pietro in Montorio]] (1503) was directly inspired by circular [[Roman temple]]s. He was, however, hardly a slave to the classical forms and it was his style that was to dominate Italian architecture in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaldo Bruschi. ''Bramante'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CampidoglioEng.jpg|thumb|left|The Campidoglio]]

===Mannerism===
{{main|Mannerism#Mannerist architecture}}

During the [[Mannerist]] period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style was [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564), who frequently used the [[giant order]] in his architecture, a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom to the top of a façade.&lt;ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2014}}{{Citation | title= Pilaster Play|author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal=  Thresholds | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/thresholds28.pdf | volume= 28 (Winter 2005)|  pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this in his design for the [[Campidoglio]] in Rome.

Prior to the 20th century, the term ''Mannerism'' had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general non-judgemental terms.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Hauser. ''Mannerism: The Crisis of the Renaissance and the Origins of Modern Art''. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

===From Renaissance to Baroque===

{{main|Baroque architecture}}
As the new style of architecture spread out from Italy, most other European countries developed a sort of Proto-Renaissance style, before the construction of fully formulated Renaissance buildings. Each country in turn then grafted its own architectural traditions to the new style, so that Renaissance buildings across Europe are diversified by region.

Within Italy the evolution of Renaissance architecture into Mannerism, with widely diverging tendencies in the work of Michelangelo and Giulio Romano and Andrea Palladio, led to the Baroque style in which the same architectural vocabulary was used for very different rhetoric.

Outside Italy, Baroque architecture was more widespread and fully developed than the Renaissance style, with significant buildings as far afield as [[Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Cathedral of Chihuahua]], 1725–1826&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Basilica Minore del Santo Niño]], present structure 1735–39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:SaintPierreRaphael.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Raphael's unused plan for St. Peter's Basilica]]
The obvious distinguishing features of Classical Roman architecture were adopted by Renaissance architects. However, the forms and purposes of buildings had changed over time, as had the structure of cities. Among the earliest buildings of the reborn Classicism were churches of a type that the Romans had never constructed. Neither were there models for the type of large city dwellings required by wealthy merchants of the 15th century. Conversely, there was no call for enormous sporting fixtures and public bath houses such as the Romans had built. The ancient orders were analysed and reconstructed to serve new purposes.&lt;ref&gt;The list of characteristics below is expanded from a list based on [[Banister Fletcher]]. See below&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plan===

The plans of Renaissance buildings have a square, symmetrical appearance in which proportions are usually based on a module. Within a church, the module is often the width of an aisle. The need to integrate the design of the plan with the façade was introduced as an issue in the work of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], but he was never able to carry this aspect of his work into fruition. The first building to demonstrate this was [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|St. Andrea]] in Mantua by [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]]. The development of the plan in secular architecture was to take place in the 16th century and culminated with the work of [[Palladio]].
[[File:Sant agostino.JPG|thumb|Sant'Agostino, Rome, Giacomo di Pietrasanta, 1483]]

====Façade====
[[Façade]]s are symmetrical around their vertical axis. Church façades are generally surmounted by a [[pediment]] and organised by a system of [[pilaster]]s, arches and [[entablature]]s. The columns and windows show a progression towards the centre. One of the first true Renaissance façades was the [[Pienza Cathedral|Cathedral of Pienza]] (1459–62), which has been attributed to the Florentine architect Bernardo Gambarelli (known as [[Rossellino]]) with [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]] perhaps having some responsibility in its design as well.

Domestic buildings are often surmounted by a [[cornice]]. There is a regular repetition of openings on each floor, and the centrally placed door is marked by a feature such as a balcony, or rusticated surround. An early and much copied prototype was the façade for the [[Palazzo Rucellai]] (1446 and 1451) in Florence with its three registers of [[pilasters]]
[[File:Classical orders from the Encyclopedie.png|thumb|left|Classical Orders, engraving from the ''Encyclopédie vol. 18.'' 18th century.]]

===Columns and pilasters===

The Greek and Roman orders of columns are used:- [[Tuscan order|Tuscan]], [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] and [[Composite order|Composite]]. The orders can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of pilasters. During the Renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, pilasters, and [[entablatures]] as an integrated system. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the [[Sagrestia Vecchia|Old Sacristy]] (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi.

===Arches===

Arches are semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental. Arches are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti was one of the first to use the arch on a monumental scale at the [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|St. Andrea]] in Mantua.

===Vaults===

Vaults do not have ribs. They are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault which is frequently rectangular. The [[barrel vault]] is returned to architectural vocabulary as at the [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|St. Andrea]] in Mantua.

===Domes===
{{main|History of Italian Renaissance domes}}
[[File:StPetersDomePD.jpg|thumb|The Dome of St Peter's Basilica, Rome.&lt;!---this is an image that speaks for itself! The rest of the info is further down the page---&gt;]]
The dome is used frequently, both as a very large structural feature that is visible from the exterior, and also as a means of roofing smaller spaces where they are only visible internally. After the success of the dome in Brunelleschi’s design for the [[Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore]] and its use in Bramante’s plan for [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (1506) in Rome, the dome became an indispensable element in church architecture and later even for secular architecture, such as Palladio's [[Villa Rotonda]].&lt;ref&gt;A major use of this feature is great dome of the [[US Capitol Building]] (begun 1856) in [[Washington DC]] and all the subsequent State Capitals buildings in the [[Renaissance Revival]] style.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ceilings===

Roofs are fitted with flat or [[coffered]] ceilings. They are not left open as in Medieval architecture. They are frequently painted or decorated.

===Doors===

Doors usually have square lintels. They may be set within an arch or surmounted by a triangular or segmental pediment.
Openings that do not have doors are usually arched and frequently have a large or decorative keystone.

===Windows===

Windows may be paired and set within a semi-circular arch. They may have square lintels and triangular or segmental pediments, which are often used alternately. Emblematic in this respect is the [[Palazzo Farnese]] in Rome, begun in 1517.
[[File:Palazzo Strozzi cortile.JPG|thumb|left|Courtyard of Palazzo Strozzi, Florence]]
In the Mannerist period the “Palladian” arch was employed, using a motif of a high semi-circular topped opening flanked with two lower square-topped openings. Windows are used to bring light into the building and in domestic architecture, to give views. Stained glass, although sometimes present, is not a feature.

===Walls===

External walls are generally constructed of brick, rendered, or faced with stone in highly finished [[ashlar]] masonry, laid in straight courses.  The corners of buildings are often emphasised by rusticated [[quoin (architecture)|quoins]]. Basements and ground floors were often rusticated, as at the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] (1444–1460) in Florence. Internal walls are smoothly plastered and surfaced with [[lime wash]]. For more formal spaces, internal surfaces are decorated with [[fresco]]es.

===Details===

Courses, mouldings and all decorative details are carved with great precision. Studying and mastering the details of the ancient Romans was one of the important aspects of Renaissance theory. The different orders each required different sets of details. Some architects were stricter in their use of classical details than others, but there was also a good deal of innovation in solving problems, especially at corners. Mouldings stand out around doors and windows rather than being recessed, as in Gothic Architecture. Sculptured figures may be set in niches or placed on plinths. They are not integral to the building as in Medieval architecture.&lt;ref name=BF&gt;[[Banister Fletcher]], ''History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''(first published 1896, current edition 2001, Elsevier Science &amp; Technology {{ISBN|0-7506-2267-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development in Italy – Early Renaissance==
The leading architects of the Early Renaissance or Quattrocento were [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Michelozzo]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]].

===Brunelleschi===
The person generally credited with bringing about the Renaissance view of architecture is [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], (1377–1446).&lt;ref&gt;Cropplestone, Trewin, ''World Architecture'', 1963, Hamlyn. Page 243&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying feature of the work of Brunelleschi was "order".
[[File:Piazza SS Annunziata Firenze Apr 2008 (3).JPG|thumb|upright|[[Ospedale degli Innocenti]] in Florence.]]
In the early 15th century, Brunelleschi began to look at the world to see what the rules were that governed one's way of seeing. He observed that the way one sees regular structures such as the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Baptistery of Florence]] and the tiled pavement surrounding it follows a mathematical order—[[linear perspective]].

The buildings remaining among the ruins of ancient Rome appeared to respect a simple mathematical order in the way that Gothic buildings did not. One incontrovertible rule governed all [[Ancient Roman architecture]]—a semi-circular arch is exactly twice as wide as it is high. A fixed proportion with implications of such magnitude occurred nowhere in [[Gothic architecture]]. A Gothic pointed arch could be extended upwards or flattened to any proportion that suited the location. Arches of differing angles frequently occurred within the same structure. No set rules of proportion applied.

From the observation of the architecture of Rome came a desire for symmetry and careful proportion in which the form and composition of the building as a whole and all its subsidiary details have fixed relationships, each section in proportion to the next, and the architectural features serving to define exactly what those rules of proportion are.&lt;ref name= W&amp;M&gt;Robert Erich Wolf and Ronald Millen, ''Renaissance and Mannerist Art'', 1968, Harry N. Abrams.&lt;/ref&gt; Brunelleschi gained the support of a number of wealthy Florentine patrons, including the Silk Guild and [[Cosimo de' Medici]].

[[File:Santa Maria del Fiore cupola (1622842169).jpg|thumb|left|The dome of [[Florence Cathedral]] (the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore)]]

====Florence Cathedral====
Brunelleschi's first major architectural commission was for the enormous brick dome which covers the central space of [[Duomo of Florence|Florence's cathedral]], designed by [[Arnolfo di Cambio]] in the 14th century but left unroofed. While often described as the first building of the Renaissance, Brunelleschi's daring design uses the pointed Gothic arch and Gothic ribs that were apparently planned by Arnolfio. It seems certain, however, that while stylistically Gothic, in keeping with the building it surmounts, the dome is in fact structurally influenced by the great dome of Ancient Rome, which Brunelleschi could hardly have ignored in seeking a solution. This is the dome of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], a circular temple, now a church.

Inside the Pantheon's single-shell concrete dome is coffering which greatly decreases the weight. The vertical partitions of the coffering effectively serve as ribs, although this feature does not dominate visually. At the apex of the Pantheon's dome is an opening, 8 meters across. Brunelleschi was aware that a dome of enormous proportion could in fact be engineered without a keystone. The dome in Florence is supported by the eight large ribs and sixteen more internal ones holding a brick shell, with the bricks arranged in a herringbone manner. Although the techniques employed are different, in practice both domes comprise a thick network of ribs supporting very much lighter and thinner infilling. And both have a large opening at the top.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Einblick LH2 San Lorenzo Florenz.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The church of San Lorenzo]]

====San Lorenzo====
The new architectural philosophy of the Renaissance is best demonstrated in the churches of [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|San Lorenzo]], and [[Santo Spirito di Firenze|Santo Spirito]] in Florence. Designed by Brunelleschi in about 1425 and 1428 respectively, both have the shape of the [[Latin cross]]. Each has a modular plan, each portion being a multiple of the square bay of the aisle. This same formula controlled also the vertical dimensions. In the case of Santo Spirito, which is entirely regular in plan, transepts and chancel are identical, while the nave is an extended version of these. In 1434 Brunelleschi designed the first Renaissance centrally planned building, [[Santa Maria degli Angeli di Firenze|Santa Maria degli Angeli]] of Florence. It is composed of a central [[octagon]] surrounded by a circuit of eight smaller chapels. From this date onwards numerous churches were built in variations of these designs.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Fanelli, ''Brunelleschi'', 1980, Becocci editore Firenze&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michelozzo===
[[Michelozzo Michelozzi]] (1396–1472), was another architect under patronage of the [[Medici]] family, his most famous work being the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]], which he was commissioned to design for [[Medici|Cosimo de' Medici]] in 1444. A decade later he built the Villa Medici at [[Fiesole]]. Among his other works for Cosimo are the library at the Convent of San Marco, Florence. He went into exile in Venice for a time with his patron. He was one of the first architects to work in the Renaissance style outside Italy, building a palace at [[Dubrovnik]].&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;
[[File:Palazzo medici riccardi 33 Sailko adj.JPG|thumb|left|Palazzo Medici Riccardi by Michelozzo. Florence, 1444]]
The Palazzo Medici Riccardi is Classical in the details of its pedimented windows and recessed doors, but, unlike the works of Brunelleschi and Alberti, there are no ''[[Classical orders|orders]]'' of columns in evidence. Instead, Michelozzo has respected the Florentine liking for rusticated stone. He has seemingly created three orders out of the three defined rusticated levels, the whole being surmounted by an enormous Roman-style cornice which juts out over the street by 2.5 meters.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

===Alberti===
[[Leon Battista Alberti]], born in Genoa (1402–1472), was an important Humanist theoretician and designer whose book on architecture ''De re Aedificatoria'' was to have lasting effect. An aspect of [[Humanism]] was an emphasis of the anatomy of nature, in particular the human form, a science first studied by the Ancient Greeks. Humanism made man the measure of things. Alberti perceived the architect as a person with great social responsibilities.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

[[File:Sant Andrea straight.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Sant'Andrea, Mantua]], the façade]]
He designed a number of buildings, but unlike Brunelleschi, he did not see himself as a builder in a practical sense and so left the supervision of the work to others. Miraculously, one of his greatest designs, that of the Church of [[Sant'Andrea in Mantua]], was brought to completion with its character essentially intact. Not so the church of [[San Francesco, Rimini|San Francesco]] in [[Rimini]], a rebuilding of a Gothic structure, which, like Sant'Andrea, was to have a façade reminiscent of a Roman triumphal arch. This was left sadly incomplete.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

Sant'Andrea is an extremely dynamic building both without and within. Its triumphal façade is marked by extreme contrasts. The projection of the order of pilasters that define the architectural elements, but are essentially non-functional, is very shallow. This contrasts with the gaping deeply recessed arch which makes a huge portico before the main door. The size of this arch is in direct contrast to the two low square-topped openings that frame it. The light and shade play dramatically over the surface of the building because of the shallowness of its mouldings and the depth of its porch. In the interior Alberti has dispensed with the traditional nave and aisles. Instead there is a slow and majestic progression of alternating tall arches and low square doorways, repeating the "[[Arch of Constantine|triumphal arch]]" motif of the façade.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rykwert, ''Leonis Baptiste Alberti'', Architectural Design, Vol 49 No 5–6, Holland St, London&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Santa Maria Novella.jpg|thumb|left|Façade of [[Santa Maria Novella]], 1456–70]]
Two of Alberti’s best known buildings are in Florence, the [[Palazzo Rucellai]] and at [[Santa Maria Novella]]. For the palace, Alberti applied the classical orders of columns to the façade on the three levels, 1446–51. At Santa Maria Novella he was commissioned to finish the decoration of the façade. He completed the design in 1456 but the work was not finished until 1470.

The lower section of the building had Gothic niches and typical polychrome marble decoration. There was a large ocular window in the end of the nave which had to be taken into account. Alberti simply respected what was already in place, and the Florentine tradition for polychrome that was well established at the [[Baptistery of Florence|Baptistery of San Giovanni]], the most revered building in the city. The decoration, being mainly polychrome marble, is mostly very flat in nature, but a sort of order is established by the regular compartments and the circular motifs which repeat the shape of the round window.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; For the first time, Alberti linked the lower roofs of the aisles to nave using two large scrolls. These were to become a standard Renaissance device for solving the problem of different roof heights and bridge the space between horizontal and vertical surfaces.&lt;ref name= Pevs&gt;[[Nikolaus Pevsner]], ''An Outline of European Architecture'', Pelican, 1964, ISBN unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century the courts of certain other Italian states became centres for spreading of Renaissance philosophy, art and architecture.

In [[Mantua]] at the court of the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]], Alberti designed two churches, the [[Sant'Andrea, Mantua|Basilica of Sant'Andrea]] and [[San Sebastiano (Mantua)|San Sebastiano]].

[[Urbino]] was an important centre with the ancient [[Palazzo Ducale, Urbino|ducal palace]] being extended for [[Federico da Montefeltro]] in the mid 15th century. The duke employed [[Luciano Laurana]] from [[Dalmatia]], renowned for his expertise at fortification. The design incorporates much of the earlier medieval building and includes an unusual turreted three-storeyed façade. Laurana was assisted by Francesco di Giorgio Martini. Later parts of the building are clearly Florentine in style, particularly the inner courtyard, but it is not known who the designer was.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, ''[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/828 Historic Centre of Urbino]'', (retrieved 10-12-20123)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ferrara]], under the [[House of Este|Este]], was expanded in the late fifteenth century, with several new palaces being built such as the [[Palazzo dei Diamanti]] and [[Palazzo Schifanoia]] for [[Borso d'Este]]. In Milan, under the [[house of Visconti|Visconti]], the [[Certosa di Pavia]] was completed, and then later under the [[Sforza]], the Castello Sforzesco was built.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

In Venice, [[San Zaccaria]] received its Renaissance façade at the hands of [[Antonio Gambello]] and [[Mauro Codussi]], begun in the 1480s.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Kaminski, ''Art and Architecture of Venice'', 1999, Könemann, {{ISBN|3-8290-2657-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giovanni Maria Falconetto]], the Veronese architect-sculptor, introduced Renaissance architecture to Padua with the Loggia Cornaro in the garden of [[Alvise Cornaro]].

In southern Italy, Renaissance masters were called to Naples by [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] after his conquest of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. The most notable examples of Renaissance architecture in that city are the [[Cappella Caracciolo]], attributed to Bramante, and the [[Palazzo Orsini di Gravina]], built by [[Gabriele d'Angelo]] between 1513 and 1549.

==High Renaissance==
[[File:Milan Santa Maria della Crazie Bramante.jpg|thumb|left|The crossing of Santa Maria della Grazie, Milan, Bramante (1490)]]
In the late 15th century and early 16th century, architects such as [[Bramante]], [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]] and others showed a mastery of the revived style and ability to apply it to buildings such as churches and city palazzo which were quite different from the structures of ancient times. The style became more decorated and ornamental, statuary, domes and [[cupola]]s becoming very evident.
The architectural period is known as the "High Renaissance" and coincides with the age of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].

===Bramante===
[[Donato Bramante]], (1444–1514), was born in [[Urbino]] and turned from painting to architecture, finding his first important patronage under [[Ludovico Sforza]], Duke of Milan, for whom he produced a number of buildings over 20 years. After the fall of [[Milan]] to the French in 1499, Bramante travelled to Rome where he achieved great success under papal patronage.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;
[[File:Santa maria delle grazie altar.jpg|thumb|The apse of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan.]]
Bramante’s finest architectural achievement in Milan is his addition of crossing and choir to the abbey church of [[Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan)]]. This is a brick structure, the form of which owes much to the Northern Italian tradition of square domed [[Baptistery|baptisteries]]. The new building is almost centrally planned, except that, because of the site, the chancel extends further than the transept arms. The hemispherical dome, of approximately 20 metres across, rises up hidden inside an octagonal [[drum (architecture)|drum]] pierced at the upper level with arched classical openings. The whole exterior has delineated details decorated with the local [[terracotta]] ornamentation.

In Rome Bramante created what has been described as "a perfect architectural gem",&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; the [[Tempietto]] in the Cloister of [[San Pietro in Montorio]]. This small circular temple marks the spot where St Peter was martyred and is thus the most sacred site in Rome. The building adapts the style apparent in the remains of the [[Temple of Vesta]], the most sacred site of Ancient Rome. It is enclosed by and in spatial contrast with the cloister which surrounds it. As approached from the cloister, as in the picture above, it is seen framed by an arch and columns, the shape of which are echoed in its free-standing form.

Bramante went on to work at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] where he designed the impressive Cortili of St. Damaso and of the [[Cortile del Belvedere|Belvedere]]. In 1506 Bramante’s design for [[Pope Julius II]]’s rebuilding of [[St. Peter’s Basilica]] was selected, and the foundation stone laid. After Bramante’s death and many changes of plan, [[Michelangelo]], as chief architect, reverted to something closer to Bramante’s original proposal. &lt;sup&gt;See below- Michelangelo.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Palais Farnese.jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo Farnese]], [[Rome]] (1534–1545). Designed by [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger|Sangallo]] and [[Michelangelo]].]]

===Sangallo===
[[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger]], (1485–1546), was one of a family of [[Military engineering|military engineers]]. His uncle, [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] was one of those who submitted a plan for the rebuilding of St Peter’s and was briefly a co-director of the project, with [[Raphael]].&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

Antonio da Sangallo also submitted a plan for St Peter’s and became the chief architect after the death of Raphael, to be succeeded himself by Michelangelo.

His fame does not rest upon his association with St Peter’s but in his building of the [[Farnese Palace]], “the grandest palace of this period”, started in 1530.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; The impression of grandness lies in part in its sheer size, (56&amp;nbsp;m long by 29.5 meters high) and in its lofty location overlooking a broad piazza. It is also a building of beautiful proportion, unusual for such a large and luxurious house of the date in having been built principally of stuccoed brick, rather than of stone. Against the smooth pink-washed walls the stone quoins of the corners, the massive rusticated portal and the stately repetition of finely detailed windows give a powerful effect, setting a new standard of elegance in palace-building. The upper of the three equally sized floors was added by Michelangelo. It is probably just as well that this impressive building is of brick; the travertine for its architectural details came not from a quarry, but from the [[Colosseum]].&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Palazzo Pandolfini, view 02 crop.JPG|thumb|left|Palazzo Pandolfini, Florence, by Raphael]]

===Raphael===
[[Raphael]], (1483–1520), [[Urbino]], trained under [[Perugino]] in [[Perugia]] before moving to Florence, was for a time the chief architect for [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter’s]], working in conjunction with Antonio Sangallo. He also designed a number of buildings, most of which were finished by others. His single most influential work is the Palazzo Pandolfini in Florence with its two stories of strongly articulated windows of a "[[Aedicula|tabernacle]]" type, each set around with ordered pilasters, cornice and alternate arched and triangular pediments.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;
{{clear}}

==Mannerism==
{{main|Mannerism}}
'''Mannerism''' in architecture was marked by widely diverging tendencies in the work of [[Michelangelo]], [[Giulio Romano]], [[Baldassare Peruzzi]] and [[Andrea Palladio]], that led to the Baroque style in which the same architectural vocabulary was used for very different rhetoric.
[[File:Palazzo Massimo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]].]]

===Peruzzi===
[[Baldassare Peruzzi]], (1481–1536), was an architect born in [[Siena]], but working in Rome, whose work bridges the High Renaissance and the Mannerist.
His [[Villa Farnesina]] of 1509 is a very regular monumental cube of two equal stories, the bays being strongly articulated by orders of pilasters. The building is unusual for its frescoed walls.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

Peruzzi’s most famous work is the [[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]] in Rome. The unusual features of this building are that its façade curves gently around a curving street. It has in its ground floor a dark central portico running parallel to the street, but as a semi enclosed space, rather than an open loggia. Above this rise three undifferentiated floors, the upper two with identical small horizontal windows in thin flat frames which contrast strangely with the deep porch, which has served, from the time of its construction, as a refuge to the city’s poor.&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;

[[File:Palazzo Te Mantova 1.jpg|thumb|[[Palazzo Te]], Mantua]]

===Giulio Romano===
[[Giulio Romano]] (1499–1546), was a pupil of Raphael, assisting him on various works for the Vatican. Romano was also a highly inventive designer, working for [[Frederick II, Duke of Mantua|Federico II Gonzaga]] at Mantua on the [[Palazzo Te]], (1524–1534), a project which combined his skills as architect, sculptor and painter. In this work, incorporating garden [[grotto]]es and extensive frescoes, he uses [[illusion|illusionistic effects]], surprising combinations of architectural form and texture, and the frequent use of features that seem somewhat disproportionate or out of alignment. The total effect is eerie and disturbing. Ilan Rachum cites Romano as ''“one of the first promoters of Mannerism”''.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;

===Michelangelo===
[[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] (1475–1564) was one of the creative giants whose achievements mark the High Renaissance. He excelled in each of the fields of painting, sculpture and architecture and his achievements brought about significant changes in each area. His architectural fame lies chiefly in two buildings: the interiors of the [[Laurentian Library]] and its lobby at the monastery of San Lorenzo in Florence, and [[St Peter's Basilica]] in Rome.

St Peter's was ''"the greatest creation of the Renaissance"'',&lt;ref name=BF /&gt; and a great number of architects contributed their skills to it. But at its completion, there was more of Michelangelo’s design than of any other architect, before or after him.

[[File:Petersdom von Engelsburg gesehen.jpg|thumb|St Peter's Basilica]]

====St Peter's====
The plan that was accepted at the laying of the foundation stone in 1506 was that by Bramante. Various changes in plan occurred in the series of architects that succeeded him, but Michelangelo, when he took over the project in 1546, reverted to Bramante’s Greek-cross plan and redesigned the piers, the walls and the dome, giving the lower weight-bearing members massive proportions and eliminating the encircling aisles from the chancel and identical transept arms. [[Helen Gardner (art historian)|Helen Gardner]] says: "Michelangelo, with a few strokes of the pen, converted its snowflake complexity into a massive, cohesive unity."&lt;ref name= Gardner /&gt;

Michelangelo’s dome was a masterpiece of design using two masonry shells, one within the other and crowned by a massive lantern supported, as at Florence, on ribs. For the exterior of the building he designed a giant order which defines every external bay, the whole lot being held together by a wide cornice which runs unbroken like a rippling ribbon around the entire building.

There is a wooden model of the dome, showing its outer shell as hemispherical. When Michelangelo died in 1564, the building had reached the height of the drum. The architect who succeeded Michelangelo was [[Giacomo della Porta]]. The dome, as built, has a much steeper projection than the dome of the model. It is generally presumed that it was della Porta who made this change to the design, to lessen the outward thrust. But, in fact it is unknown who it was that made this change, and it is equally possible and a stylistic likelihood that the person who decided upon the more dynamic outline was Michelangelo himself at some time during the years that he supervised the project.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner and Gardener suggest that Michelangelo began with the idea of a pointed dome, as in Florence, then in his old age reverted to the lower silhouette, and that della Porta stuck to Michelangelo's original concept. Mignacca, on the other hand, suggests that the pointed dome was Michelangelo's final, and brilliant, solution to the apparent visual tension within the building.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laurentian Library vestibule.jpg|thumb|left|The vestibule of the Laurentian Library]]

====Laurentian Library====
Michelangelo was at his most Mannerist in the design of the vestibule of the [[Laurentian Library]], also built by him to house the [[Cosimo de' Medici|Medici]] collection of books at the convent of [[San Lorenzo, Florence|San Lorenzo]] in Florence, the same San Lorenzo’s at which [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] had recast church architecture into a Classical mold and established clear formula for the use of [[Classical orders]] and their various components.

Michelangelo takes all Brunelleschi’s components and bends them to his will. The Library is upstairs. It is a long low building with an ornate wooden ceiling, a matching floor and crowded with corrals finished by his successors to Michelangelo’s design. But it is a light room, the natural lighting streaming through a long row of windows that appear positively crammed between the order of pilasters that march along the wall. The vestibule, on the other hand, is tall, taller than it is wide and is crowded by a large staircase that pours out of the library in what [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] refers to as a “flow of lava”, and bursts in three directions when it meets the balustrade of the landing. It is an intimidating staircase, made all the more so because the rise of the stairs at the center is steeper than at the two sides, fitting only eight steps into the space of nine.

The space is crowded and it is to be expected that the wall spaces would be divided by pilasters of low projection. But Michelangelo has chosen to use paired columns, which, instead of standing out boldly from the wall, he has sunk deep into recesses within the wall itself. In San Lorenzo's church nearby, Brunelleschi used little scrolling console brackets to break the strongly horizontal line of the course above the arcade. Michelangelo has borrowed Brunelleschi’s motifs and stood each pair of sunken columns on a pair of twin console [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]]. [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Pevsner]] says the ''“Laurenziana... reveals Mannerism in its most sublime architectural form”''.&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Goldscheider, ''Michelangelo'', 1964, Phaidon.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Church of the Gesù, Rome crop.jpg|thumb|left|Il Gesù, designed by Giacomo della Porta.]]

===Giacomo della Porta===
[[Giacomo della Porta]], (c.1533–1602), was famous as the architect who made the dome of St Peter’s Basilica a reality. The change in outline between the dome as it appears in the model and the dome as it was built, has brought about speculation as to whether the changes originated with della Porta or with Michelangelo himself.

Della Porta spent nearly all his working life in Rome, designing villas, palazzi and churches in the Mannerist style. One of his most famous works is the façade of the [[Church of the Gesù]], a project that he inherited from his teacher [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]]. Most characteristics of the original design are maintained, subtly transformed to give more weight to the central section, where della Porta uses, among other motifs, a low triangular pediment overlaid on a segmental one above the main door. The upper storey and its pediment give the impression of compressing the lower one. The center section, like that of Sant'Andrea at Mantua, is based on the Triumphal Arch, but has two clear horizontal divisions like [[Santa Maria Novella]]. &lt;sup&gt;See Alberti above.&lt;/sup&gt; The problem of linking the aisles to the nave is solved using Alberti’s scrolls, in contrast to Vignola’s solution which provided much smaller brackets and four statues to stand above the paired pilasters, visually weighing down the corners of the building. The influence of the design may be seen in Baroque churches throughout Europe.

===Andrea Palladio===
[[Andrea Palladio]], (1508–80), "the most influential architect of the whole Renaissance"',&lt;ref name= BF /&gt; was, as a stonemason, introduced to Humanism by the poet [[Giangiorgio Trissino]]. His first major architectural commission was the rebuilding of the [[Basilica Palladiana]] at [[Vicenza]], in the [[Veneto]] where he was to work most of his life.&lt;ref name= I.R. /&gt;
[[File:La Rotonda.png|thumb|[[Villa Capra La Rotonda]]]]
Palladio was to transform the architectural style of both palaces and churches by taking a different perspective on the notion of Classicism. While the architects of Florence and Rome looked to structures like the [[Colosseum]] and the [[Arch of Constantine]] to provide formulae, Palladio looked to classical temples with their simple peristyle form. When he used the “[[Arch of Constantine|triumphal arch]]” motif of a large arched opening with lower square-topped opening on either side, he invariably applied it on a small scale, such as windows, rather than on a large scale as Alberti used it at Sant’Andrea’s. This Ancient Roman motif&lt;ref&gt;described by the architectural writer [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554) in ''Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetivaref''&lt;/ref&gt; is often referred to as the ''Palladian Arch''.

The best known of Palladio’s domestic buildings is [[Villa Capra]], otherwise known as "la Rotonda", a centrally planned house with a domed central hall and four identical façades, each with a temple-like portico like that of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Wundram, Thomas Pape, Paolo Marton, ''Andrea Palladio'', Taschen, {{ISBN|3-8228-0271-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Villa Cornaro]], the projecting portico of the north façade and recessed loggia of the garden façade are of two [[Classical order|ordered]] stories, the upper forming a [[balcony]].&lt;ref&gt;Branco Mitrovic and Stephen R. Wassell, ''Andrea Palladio: Villa Cornaro in Piombino Dese'' (New York: Acanthus Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-926494-36-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Alberti, della Porta and others, in the designing of a church façade, Palladio was confronted by the problem of visually linking the aisles to the nave while maintaining and defining the structure of the building. Palladio’s solution was entirely different from that employed by della Porta. At the [[church of San Giorgio Maggiore]] in Venice he overlays a tall temple, its columns raised on high plinths, over another low wide temple façade, its columns rising from the basements and its narrow lintel and pilasters appearing behind the giant order of the central nave.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

==Progression from Early Renaissance through to Baroque==
[[File:1993-1994-Giardino Giusti (Verona)-testo e photo Paolo Villa-nA2-tesi Accademia Belle Arti Bologna-portone di Palazzo Giusti.jpg|thumb|[[Keystone (architecture)|Keystone]] with profile of man, [[Palazzo Giusti]], Verona, Italy]]
In Italy, there appears to be a seamless progression from Early Renaissance architecture through the High Renaissance and Mannerist to the Baroque style. Pevsner comments about the vestibule of the Laurentian Library that it "has often been said that the motifs of the walls show Michelangelo as the father of the Baroque".

While continuity may be the case in Italy, it was not necessarily the case elsewhere. The adoption of the Renaissance style of architecture was slower in some areas than in others, as may be seen in England, for example. Indeed, as [[Pope Julius II]] was having the ancient Basilica of St. Peter’s demolished to make way for the new, [[Henry VII of England]] was adding a glorious new chapel in the [[English Gothic architecture|Perpendicular Gothic]] style to [[Westminster Abbey]].

Likewise, the style that was to become known as Baroque evolved in Italy in the early 17th century, at about the time that the first fully Renaissance buildings were constructed at Greenwich and Whitehall in England,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Queen's House, Greenwich]] and the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall]]&lt;/ref&gt; after a prolonged period of experimentation with Classical motifs applied to local architectural forms, or conversely, the adoption of Renaissance structural forms in the broadest sense with an absence of the formulae that governed their use. While the English were just discovering what the rules of Classicism were, the Italians were experimenting with methods of breaking them. In England, following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the Monarchy in 1660, the architectural climate changed, and taste moved in the direction of the Baroque. Rather than evolving, as it did in Italy, it arrived fully fledged.

In a similar way, in many parts of Europe that had few purely classical and ordered buildings like Brunelleschi’s Santo Spirito and Michelozzo’s Medici Riccardi Palace, Baroque architecture appeared almost unheralded, on the heels of a sort of Proto-Renaissance local style.&lt;ref name= Jan&gt;Janson, H.W., Anthony F. Janson (1997). ''History of Art'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc.. {{ISBN|0-8109-3442-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the Baroque and its replacement of traditional and more conservative Renaissance architecture was particularly apparent in the building of churches as part of the [[Counter Reformation]].&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;

{{main|Northern Renaissance}}
The 16th century saw the economic and political ascendancy of France and Spain, and then later of Holland, England, Germany and Russia. The result was that these places began to import the Renaissance style as indicators of their new cultural position. This also meant that it was not until about 1500 and later that signs of Renaissance architectural style began to appear outside Italy.

Though Italian architects were highly sought after, such as [[Sebastiano Serlio]] in France, [[Aristotile Fioravanti]] in [[Russia]], and [[Francesco Fiorentino]] in [[Poland]], soon, non-Italians were studying Italian architecture and translating it into their own idiom. These included [[Philibert de l'Orme]] (1510–1570) in France, [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]] (died: 1567) in Spain, [[Inigo Jones]] (1573–1652) in England and [[Elias Holl]] (1573–1646) in Germany.&lt;ref name= Jan /&gt;

Books or ornament prints with [[engraving|engraved]] illustrations demonstrating plans and ornament were very important in spreading Renaissance styles in Northern Europe, with among the most important authors being [[Androuet du Cerceau]] in France, and [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]] in the Netherlands, and [[Wendel Dietterlin]], author of ''Architectura'' (1593–94) in Germany.

{{main|Architecture of Croatia}}
In the 15th century, [[Croatia]] was divided into three states – the northern and central part of Croatia and [[Slavonia]] were in union with the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], while [[Dalmatia]], with the exception of independent [[Dubrovnik]], was under the rule of the [[Venetian Republic]]. The [[Cathedral of St. James, Šibenik|Cathedral of St.James]] in [[Šibenik]], was begun in 1441 in the Gothic style by [[Giorgio da Sebenico]] ''(Juraj Dalmatinac)''. Its unusual construction does not use mortar, the stone blocks, [[pilaster]]s and [[ribs]] being bonded with [[joints]] and [[Groove (engineering)|slots]] in the way that was usual in wooden constructions. In 1477 the work was unfinished, and continued under [[Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino]] who respected the mode of construction and the plan of the former architect, but continued the work which includes the upper windows, the vaults and the dome, in the Renaissance style. The combination of a high barrel vault with lower half-barrel vaults over the aisles the gives the façade its distinctive [[trefoil]] shape, the first of this type in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506013344/http://www.sibenik.hr/vodic-eng/sibenik/kulturno_povijesna_bastina2.asp |archivedate=6 May 2009 |url=http://www.sibenik.hr/vodic-eng/sibenik/kulturno_povijesna_bastina2.asp |title=St James’s Cathedral}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cathedral was listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] in 2001.

{{main|Renaissance architecture in Central Europe}}

One of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The style appeared following the marriage of King [[Matthias Corvinus]] and [[Beatrice of Naples]] in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and [[masonry|masons]] arrived at [[Buda]] with the new queen. Important remains of the Early Renaissance summer palace of King Matthias can be found in [[Visegrád]]. The Ottoman conquest of Hungary after 1526 cut short the development of Renaissance architecture in the country and destroyed its most famous examples. Today, the only completely preserved work of Hungarian Renaissance architecture is the Bakócz Chapel (commissioned by the Hungarian cardinal [[Tamás Bakócz]]), now part of the [[Esztergom Basilica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hung-art.hu/kep/zmisc/faragvan/162_sz/bakocz01.jpg Image of Bakócz Chapel] (1506–08)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Russian architecture|Renaissance architecture in Eastern Europe}}
Prince [[Ivan III]] introduced Renaissance architecture to [[Russia]] by inviting a number of architects from [[Italy]], who brought new construction techniques and some Renaissance style elements with them, while in general following the traditional designs of the [[Russian architecture]]. In 1475 the Bolognese architect [[Aristotele Fioravanti]] came to rebuild the [[Cathedral of the Dormition]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], damaged in an earthquake. Fioravanti was given the 12th-century [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Vladimir Cathedral]] as a model, and produced a design combining traditional Russian style with a Renaissance sense of spaciousness, proportion and symmetry.

In 1485 Ivan III commissioned the building of a royal [[Terem Palace]] within the Kremlin, with [[Aloisio da Milano]] being the architect of the first three floors. Aloisio da Milano, as well as the other Italian architects, also greatly contributed to the construction of the [[Kremlin wall]]s [[Kremlin towers|and towers]]. The small banqueting hall of the [[Russian Tsar]]s, called the [[Palace of Facets]] because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two Italians, [[Marco Ruffo]] and [[Pietro Solario]], and shows a more Italian style. In 1505, an Italian known in Russia as [[Aleviz Novyi]] built 12 churches for Ivan III, including the [[Cathedral of the Archangel]], a building remarkable for the successful blending of Russian tradition, Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style.

===Poland===
{{main|Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance architecture in Central Europe|Mannerist architecture and sculpture in Poland}}
[[Polish Renaissance]] architecture is divided into three periods:
The First period (1500–50), is the so-called "Italian". Most of Renaissance buildings were building of this time were by Italian architects, mainly from [[Florence]] including [[Francesco Fiorentino]] and [[Bartolomeo Berrecci]] ([[Wawel]] Courtyard, [[Sigismund's Chapel]]).

In the Second period (1550–1600), Renaissance architecture became more common, with the beginnings of [[Mannerist]] and under the influence of the Netherlands, particularly in [[Pomerania]]. Buildings include the New [[Sukiennice|Cloth Hall]] in Kraków and city halls in [[Tarnów]], [[Sandomierz]], [[Chełm]] (demolished) and most famously in [[Poznań]].

In the Third period (1600–50), the rising power of [[Jesuits]] and [[Counter Reformation]] gave impetus to the development of Mannerist architecture and Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Busch, Bernd Lohse, Hans Weigert, ''Baukunst der Renaissance in Europa.

===Crown of Bohemia===
{{main|Czech Renaissance architecture}}
[[File:Letohrádek královny Anny by Crazyspeak (2).jpg|thumb|right|Royal Summer Palace in Prague considered the purest Renaissance architecture outside Italy&lt;ref name=guide&gt;{{cite book|title=Prague : City Guidebook|date=2000|publisher=Kartografie|location=Prague|isbn=80-7011-597-1|page=40|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Renaissance style first appeared in the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Crown of Bohemia]] in the 1490s. Bohemia together with its incorporated lands, especially Moravia, thus ranked among the areas of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with the earliest known examples of the Renaissance architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamlin|first1=Alfred D.|title=History of architecture|date=2010|publisher=Salzwasser-Verlag|location=Bremen|isbn=9783861952503|page=338|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=g89phgpRZOEC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lands of the Bohemian Crown were never part of the ancient [[Roman Empire]], thus they missed their own ancient classical heritage and had to be dependent on the primarily Italian models. As well as in other Central European countries the Gothic style kept its position especially in the church architecture. The traditional [[Gothic architecture]] was considered timeless and therefore able to express the sacredness. The Renaissance architecture coexisted with the Gothic style in Bohemia and Moravia until the late 16th century (e. g. the residential part of a palace was built in the modern Renaissance style but its chapel was designed with Gothic elements). The façades of Czech Renaissance buildings were often decorated with [[sgraffito]] (figural or ornamental).

During the reign of Holy Roman Emperor and Bohemian King [[Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]], the city of Prague became one of the most important European centers of the late Renaissance art (so-called [[Northern Mannerism|Mannerism]]). Nevertheless, not many architecturally significant buildings have been preserved from that time.

{{main|French Renaissance architecture}}
During the early years of the 16th century the French were involved in wars in northern Italy, bringing back to France not just the Renaissance art treasures as their war [[Looting|booty]], but also stylistic ideas. In the [[Loire Valley]] a wave of building was carried and many Renaissance châteaux appeared at this time, the earliest example being the [[Château d'Amboise]] (c. 1495) in which [[Leonardo da Vinci]] spent his last years. The style became dominant under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (See [[Châteaux of the Loire Valley]]).&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt;

===Netherlands/Flanders===
{{main|Renaissance in the Netherlands}}
As in painting, Renaissance architecture took some time to reach the Netherlands and did not entirely supplant the Gothic elements. An architect directly influenced by the Italian masters was [[Cornelis Floris de Vriendt]], who designed the [[Antwerp City Hall|city hall of Antwerpen]], finished in 1564. The style sometimes known as "Antwerp Mannerism", keeping a similar overall structure to late-Gothic buildings, but with larger windows and much florid decoration and detailing in Renaissance styles, was widely influential across Northern Europe, for example in [[Elizabethan architecture]], and is part of the wider movement of [[Northern Mannerism]].

In the early 17th century [[Dutch Republic]], [[Hendrick de Keyser]] played an important role in developing the '''Amsterdam Renaissance''' style, which has local characteristics including the prevalence of tall narrow town-houses, the "trapgevel" or [[Crow-stepped gable|Dutch gable]] and the employment of decorative triangular pediments over doors and windows in which the apex rises much more steeply than in most other Renaissance architecture, but in keeping with the profile of the gable. Carved stone details are often of low profile, in [[strapwork]] resembling leatherwork, a stylistic feature originating in the [[School of Fontainebleau]]. This feature was exported to England.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt;

===Germany===
[[File:Juleum Helmstedt.jpg|thumb|[[University of Helmstedt|Juleum]] in [[Helmstedt]], Germany (example of [[Weser Renaissance]])]]
{{main|German Renaissance}}
The Renaissance in Germany was inspired first by German philosophers and artists such as [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Johannes Reuchlin]] who visited Italy. Important early examples of this period are especially the [[Landshut Residence]], the [[Heidelberg Castle|Castle]] in [[Heidelberg]], [[Schloss Johannisburg|Johannisburg Palace]] in [[Aschaffenburg]], [[Schloss Weilburg]], the [[Augsburg Town Hall|City Hall]] and [[Fuggerhäuser|Fugger Houses]] in [[Augsburg]] and [[St. Michael's Church, Munich|St. Michael]] in [[Munich]]. A particular form of Renaissance architecture in Germany is the [[Weser Renaissance]], with prominent examples such as the [[Town Hall of Bremen|City Hall]] of [[Bremen]] and the [[University of Helmstedt|Juleum]] in [[Helmstedt]].

In July 1567 the city council of [[Cologne]] approved a design in the Renaissance style by Wilhelm Vernukken for a two storied loggia for [[Cologne City Hall]]. [[Michaelskirche (München)|St Michael]] in [[Munich]] is the largest Renaissance church north of the Alps. It was built by [[William V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke William V]] of [[Bavaria]] between 1583 and 1597 as a spiritual center for the [[Counter Reformation]] and was inspired by the Church of [[il Gesù]] in Rome. The architect is unknown.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name=A.M /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt; Many examples of [[List of Brick Renaissance buildings|Brick Renaissance buildings]] can be found in [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] old towns, such as [[Stralsund]], [[Wismar]], [[Lübeck]], [[Lüneburg]], [[Friedrichstadt]] and [[Stade]]. Notable German Renaissance architects include [[Friedrich Sustris]], [[Benedikt Rejt]], [[Abraham van den Blocke]], [[Elias Holl]] and [[Hans Krumpper]].

===England===
[[File:Hardwick Hall 3 (7027835143).jpg|thumb|English Renaissance: [[Hardwick Hall]] (1590–1597).]]
{{main|Elizabethan architecture|Palladian architecture}}
Renaissance architecture arrived in England during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], having first spread through the [[Low countries]] where among other features it acquired versions of the [[Crow-stepped gable|Dutch gable]], and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[strapwork]] in geometric designs adorning the walls. The new style tended to manifest itself in large square tall houses such as [[Longleat House]].

The first great exponent of Italian Renaissance architecture in England was [[Inigo Jones]] (1573–1652), who had studied architecture in Italy where the influence of Palladio was very strong. Jones returned to England full of enthusiasm for the new movement and immediately began to design such buildings as the [[Queen's House]] at [[Greenwich]] in 1616 and the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banqueting House]] at [[Whitehall]] three years later. These works, with their clean lines, and symmetry were revolutionary in a country still enamoured with mullion windows, crenellations and turrets.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Summerson, ''Architecture in Britain 1530–1830'', 1977 ed., Pelican, {{ISBN|0-14-056003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

[[File:Ventana2.jpg|thumb|[[El Escorial|The Escorial]] (1563–1584), [[Madrid]].]]
In Spain, Renaissance began to be grafted to Gothic forms in the last decades of the 15th century. The new style is called [[Plateresque]], because of the extremely decorated façade, that brought to the mind the decorative motifs of the intricately detailed work of [[silversmith]]s, the ''Plateros''. Classical orders and candelabra motifs (''a candelieri'') combined freely into symmetrical wholes.

From the mid-sixteenth century, under such architects as Pedro Machuca, [[Juan Bautista de Toledo]] and [[Juan de Herrera]] there was a closer adherence to the art of ancient Rome, sometimes anticipating [[Mannerism]], examples of which include the [[palace of Charles V]] in [[Granada]] and the [[Escorial]].&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;&lt;ref name=A.M /&gt;&lt;ref name= W&amp;M /&gt;

{{main|Renaissance architecture in Portugal|Portuguese Renaissance}}
As in Spain, the adoption of the Renaissance style in Portugal was gradual. The so-called [[Manueline]] style (c. 1490–1535) married Renaissance elements to Gothic structures with the superficial application of exuberant ornament similar to the [[Isabelline Gothic]] of Spain. Examples of Manueline include the [[Belém Tower]], a defensive building of Gothic form decorated with Renaissance-style [[loggia]]s, and the [[Jerónimos Monastery]], with Renaissance ornaments decorating portals, columns and cloisters.

The first "pure" Renaissance structures appear under [[John III of Portugal|King John III]], like the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Conceição in Tomar (1532–40), the ''Porta Especiosa'' of [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra|Coimbra Cathedral]] and the Graça Church at [[Évora]] (c. 1530–1540), as well as the cloisters of the Cathedral of [[Viseu]] (c. 1528–1534) and [[Convent of Christ]] in Tomar (John III Cloisters, 1557–1591). The [[Lisbon]] buildings of [[Igreja de São Roque (Lisbon)|São Roque Church]] (1565–87) and the Mannerist [[Monastery of São Vicente de Fora]] (1582–1629), strongly influenced religious architecture in both Portugal and its colonies in the next centuries.&lt;ref name=BF /&gt;

[[File:Frederiksborg Castle and boat crop.jpg|thumb|left|Nordic Renaissance: [[Frederiksborg Palace]] (1602–20)]]

===Scandinavia===
{{main|Architecture of Denmark|Architecture}}
The Renaissance architecture that found its way to Scandinavia was influenced by the Flemish architecture, and included high gables and a castle air as demonstrated in the architecture of Frederiksborg Palace. Consequently, much of the Neo-Renaissance to be found in the Scandinavian countries is derived from this source.

In Denmark, Renaissance architecture thrived during the reigns of [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederick II]] and especially [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]. Inspired by the French castles of the times, Flemish architects designed masterpieces such as Kronborg Castle in Helsingør and Frederiksborg Palace in Hillerød. Frederiksborg Palace (1602–1620) in Hillerod is the largest Renaissance palace in Scandinavia.

Elsewhere, in Sweden, with [[Gustav Vasa]]'s seizure of power and the onset of the Protestant reformation, church construction and aristocratic building projects came to a near standstill. During this time period, several magnificent so-called Vasa castles appeared. They were erected at strategic locations to control the country as well as to accommodate the travelling royal court. [[Gripsholm Castle]], [[Kalmar Castle]] and [[Vadstena Castle]] are known for their fusion of medieval elements with Renaissance architecture.

The architecture of [[Norway]] was influenced partly by the occurrence of the plague during the Renaissance era. After the Black Death, monumental construction in Norway came to a standstill. There are few examples of Renaissance architecture in Norway, the most prominent being renovations to the medieval [[Rosenkrantz Tower]] in Bergen, [[Barony Rosendal]] in Hardanger, and the contemporary [[Austrått|Austrat manor]] near Trondheim, and parts of [[Akershus Fortress]].

There is little evidence of Renaissance influence in Finnish architecture.

===Baltic States===
[[File:House of Blackheads - Riga.jpg|thumb|right|The [[House of the Blackheads]] in [[Riga]], Latvia]]
{{main|Renaissance in Poland|Architecture of Estonia}}
The Renaissance arrived late in what is today [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], the so-called [[Baltic States]], and did not make a great imprint architecturally. It was a politically tumultuous time, marked by the decline of the [[State of the Teutonic Order]] and the [[Livonian War]].

In Estonia, artistic influences came from Dutch, Swedish and Polish sources.&lt;ref name=toivo&gt;{{cite book |last=Miljan |first=Toivo |title=Historical Dictionary of Estonia |year=2004 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810865716 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building of the [[House of the Blackheads (Tallinn)|Brotherhood of the Blackheads in Tallinn]] with a façade designed by [[Arent Passer]], is the only truly Renaissance building in the country that has survived more or less intact.&lt;ref name= "Viirand"&gt;{{cite book | last = Viirand| first = Tiiu| authorlink = | title = Estonia.

Latvian Renaissance architecture was influenced by Polish-Lithuanian and Dutch style, with [[Mannerism]] following from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] without intermediaries. [[St. John's Church, Riga|St. John's Church]] in the Latvian capital of [[Riga]] is example of an earlier Gothic church which was reconstructed in 1587–89 by the Dutch architect Gert Freze (Joris Phraeze). The prime example of Renaissance architecture in Latvia is the heavily decorated [[House of the Blackheads]], rebuilt from an earlier Medieval structure into its present Mannerist forms as late as 1619–25 by the architects A. and L. Jansen. It was destroyed during World War II and rebuilt during the 1990s.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= Gordon (ed.)|authorlink= |title= The Grove Encyclopedia of Northern Renaissance Art |url= |year= 2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn= 9780195334661|volume=2|page=441}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithuania meanwhile formed one half of the large Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth. Renaissance influences grew stronger during the reign of the [[Grand Duke of Lithuania|Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] [[Sigismund I the Old]] and [[Sigismund II Augustus]]. The [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] (destroyed in 1801, a copy built in 2002–2009) show Italian influences. Several architects of Italian origin were active in the country, including [[Bernardino Zanobi de Gianotis]], [[Giovanni Cini]] and [[Giovanni Maria Mosca]].&lt;ref name="grove2"&gt;{{cite book |last= Campbell|first= Gordon (ed.)|authorlink= |title= The Grove Encyclopedia of Northern Renaissance Art |url= |year= 2009|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn= 9780195334661|volume=2|pages=486–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{main|Renaissance Revival architecture}}
[[File:Cathédrale Marie-Reine du Monde, intérieur.jpg|thumb|[[Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral]], [[Montreal]] (19th century)]]
During the 19th century there was a conscious revival of the style in [[Renaissance Revival architecture]], that paralleled the [[Gothic Revival]]. Whereas the Gothic style was perceived by architectural theorists&lt;ref&gt;[[John Ruskin]]&lt;br&gt;[[Cambridge Camden Society]]&lt;/ref&gt; as being the most appropriate style for Church building, the Renaissance palazzo was a good model for urban secular buildings requiring an appearance of dignity and reliability such as banks, gentlemen's clubs and apartment blocks.&lt;ref&gt;An influential example, The [[Reform Club]] in London (1841) by [[Charles Barry]] was closely inspired by the [[Palazzo Farnese]], discussed above [http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/england/london/barry/reform.html Photos and commentary]&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings that sought to impress, such as the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera]], were often of a more Mannerist or Baroque style.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]&lt;/ref&gt; Architects of factories, office blocks and department stores continued to use the Renaissance palazzo form into the 20th century, in [[Mediterranean Revival Style architecture]] with an Italian Renaissance emphasis.&lt;ref name= Pevs /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Sullivan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the concepts and forms of Renaissance architecture can be traced through subsequent architectural movements—from Renaissance to High-Renaissance, to Mannerism, to Baroque (or [[Rococo]]), to [[Neo-Classicism]], and to [[Eclecticism]].  While Renaissance style and motifs were largely purged from [[Modernism]], they have been reasserted in some [[Postmodern architecture]]. The influence of Renaissance architecture can still be seen in many of the modern styles and rules of architecture today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7252">The '''seclusion of girls at puberty''' has been practised in societies around the world, especially prior to the early 20th century. In such cultures, girls' puberty held more significance than boys' due to [[Culture and menstruation|menstruation]], the girl's potential for giving birth, and widespread ideas of [[ritual purification]] related to the sacred power of blood.&lt;ref name=benedict &gt;{{cite book|author = Benedict, Ruth|year = 2002|title = Cultural Sociology|editor=Spillman, Lyn|chapter= The Diversity of Cultures|page = 22|publisher  = Blackwell Publishers Ltd|isbn= 0-631-21652-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These societies practised various [[Rite of passage|rites of passage]], many of which lost their original forms or completely disappeared with the emergence of modern trends such as [[industrialization]].&lt;ref name=Broude20051 &gt;{{cite book|author= Broude, Ruth|year = 2005|title= The Birkshire Encyclopedia of World History|editor1-first=W.

==Rites==
[[File:Venus figurine cave of Laussel.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Venus of Laussel]]]]
Two rules were common in the seclusion of adolescent girls: the girl must neither touch the ground nor see the sun. According to [[Sir James George Frazer]], these rules also applied to [[divine king]]s and priests. These divine kings were carried on shoulders by their underlings who walked upon tapestry or carpet. Scholars have speculated that the [[Paleolithic]] [[Venus figurines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelureofnoma.com/?p=131|title=Seclusion of Girls – Evidence from Paleolithic Times?|date=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=May 2012}} are related to such puberty rites as they lack facial features (not seeing the sun), their tapered legs without feet (not touching the ground), and their [[adiposity]] (caused by seclusion).

Among puberty rites which Frazer described, many adhered to the above rules:
* Once a girl from [[Zulu people|Zulu tribes]] in [[South Africa]] showed the first signs of puberty, she had to cover her head with her blanket and hide among the reeds by the river until the sunset. Afterward, she had to stay in a hut for some time before coming back to the society.&lt;ref name=frazer&gt;{{cite book|author= Frazer, James|year = 1993|title = The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion|chapter= Between Heaven and Earth|publisher  = Wordsworth Editions Ltd|isbn= 1-85326-310-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] and in the Kabadi District of [[New Guinea]], pubescent girls were kept indoors in seclusion for several years.&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;
*In many societies, including [[Brahmin]]s of [[Bengal]], girls undergoing puberty were not allowed to see any males, not even their relatives. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of [[California]] did not allow girls in their first menstruation to "look about". 
*Among the [[Tiyan]]s of [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]], such girls were not allowed to catch the sight of a cow or touch "any other person, tree or plant".&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;
* Among the Tukuna of the Northwest Amazon, the girl at puberty is kept in isolation for about three months while preparation for the ceremony is underway. During this time, she "is believed to be susceptible to all varieties of supernatural power"&lt;ref name=Lincoln&gt;{{cite book|author= Lincoln, Bruce|year = 1981|title = Emerging from the Chrysalis: Studies in Rituals of Women's Initiation|publisher  = Harvard University Press|isbn= 0-674-24840-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|50–52}}
Frazer believed that the Greek myth of [[Danaë]], who was kept by her father in seclusion but was impregnated by [[Zeus]], was related to girls' puberty rites.&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;{{rp|602}} Lincoln also finds parallels between the Greek myth about the abduction of Persephone and the seclusion of girls at puberty. According to him, the seclusion of Tukuna girls at puberty may be referred to as "being in the underworld".&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;{{rp|77}}

==Reasons for the seclusion==

===Preparation for womanhood===
Such seclusion rites are linked to the social preparation of girls for womanhood and their roles as wives and mothers. During their seclusion, girls would be taught by older women about their future roles.&lt;ref name=Broude20051 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker1905 &gt;{{cite book|author= Langloh Parker,  Katherine|authorlink=K. Langloh Parker |year = 1905|title= [[s:The Euahlayi Tribe|The Euahlayi Tribe]]: A Study of Aboriginal Life in Australia|chapter = [[s:The Euahlayi Tribe/Chapter 7#56|Birth—Betrothal—An Aboriginal Girl From Infancy To Womanhood]]|page=56-58|publisher=Archibald Constable and Company|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superstition===
Frazer claims the reason for seclusion practises was the "deeply engrained dread" of "menstruous blood". The first appearance of menstrual blood caused more fear than subsequent menstrual cycles. These fears stemmed more from [[superstition]] related to the sacred power of blood than from hygienic issues or the possible spread of disease.

Among the [[Apache Indians]], "the adolescent girls are not segregated as sources of danger, but court is paid to them as to direct sources of supernatural blessing".&lt;ref name=benedict /&gt; A girl at her first menstruation was considered to be possessed of "a degree of supernatural power" which, though not entirely malevolent, still aroused feelings of the "power of evil".

The [[Bushmen]] of South Africa believed that making eye contact with a girl during this period would make men "fixed in whatever position they happen to occupy".&lt;ref name=frazer /&gt;&lt;!--{{rp|606}}--&gt;

In earlier societies, some pubescent girls might have shown some unusual behaviours, giving rise to superstitions. Such behaviours could have been triggered by a number of factors; for example, pubescent girls are more prone to [[Depression (mood)|depressive]] episodes than boys of a similar age. Historical records also show that these girls may have been subjects of [[incest|incestuous relationships]] and [[child abuse|abuse]], triggering abnormal behaviours.&lt;ref name=Arachige2009 &gt;{{cite book|author = Arachige, Darshi|year = 2009|title  = The Lure of Noma: On the Elegance of Religion|url = http://www.boomerangbooks.com.au/Lure-of-Noma/Darshi-Arachige/book_9780980631432.htm|chapter= How did religion arise?

A '''segue''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-segue.ogg|ˈ|s|ɛ|ɡ|w|eɪ}} ({{IPA-it|ˈseːɡwe}}) is a smooth transition from one topic or section to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is derived from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''segue'', "follows".

==In music==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}
In [[music]], ''segue'' is a direction to the performer. It means ''continue (the next section) without a pause''. The term [[attacca]] is used synonymously.

For written music it implies a transition from one [[section (music)|section]] to the next without any break. In [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]], it is often used for transitions created as a part of the performance, leading from one section to another.

In live performance, a segue can occur during a [[jam session]], where the improvisation of the end of one song progresses into a new song. Segues can even occur between groups of musicians during live performance. For example, as one band finishes its set, members of the following act replace members of the first band one by one, until a complete band swap occurs.

In recorded music, a segue is a seamless transition between one song and another. The effect is often achieved through [[beatmatching]], especially on [[dance (music)|dance]] and [[disco]] recordings, or through arrangements that create the effect of a musical [[suite (music)|suite]], a classical style also used in many [[progressive rock]] recordings. The songs may further contain a lyrical connection or overall theme as well. With breakless joins of the elements in his albums [[Frank Zappa]] made extensive use of the segue technique.&lt;ref name="zappa"&gt;{{cite book |title=Frank Zappa FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Father of Invention |first1=John |last1=Corcelli |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-61713-673-3 |page=290 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8e7aDgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=8e7aDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT209 Extract of page 290]&lt;/ref&gt; This was first used in 1966 on Zappa's ''[[Freak Out!]]'', and a year later on the [[Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.&lt;ref name="zappa" /&gt;

In some Brazilian musical styles, where it is called "emendar" ("to splice"), in particular in [[Samba]] and [[Forró]] Pé de Serra, it is very commonly used in live performances, creating sets that usually last around 20 minutes but can sometimes take more than an hour, switching seamlessly between different songs.   The larger rhythm groups of bands, with up to ten percussionists in Samba for example, facilitate the switching of one song to another, as the percussionists keep the rhythm or beat going while the pitch instruments prepare the harmonical transition to the next song, often with just one pitch instrument leading this transition.   In [[Forró]] trios, where the only pitch instrument (apart from the voice) is the accordion (which plays together with two percussionists), the accordionist usually "puxa" ("pulls") the next song as soon as the previous has finished.

Some album notations distinguish track listings through the use of symbols, such as a &gt;, →, or / to indicate songs that flow seamlessly. The alternative rock band [[Failure (band)|Failure]] separates these musical transitions into individual tracks, which are simply given numerical distinctions such as ''Segue 1''. This system began with their 1996 album ''[[Fantastic Planet (album)|Fantastic Planet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.readjunk.com/reviews/albumreviews/failure-in-the-future/&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film or broadcast news production==

In audio/visual media, a segue is smooth transition from one scene or topic to another. A segue allows the director or show host to naturally proceed from one scene or topic to another without jarring the audience. A good segue makes the transition look natural and effortless.

'''Sexual orientation change efforts''' ('''SOCE''') are methods used in attempts to change the [[sexual orientation]] of [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] and [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] people to [[heterosexuality]].&lt;ref name="apa2009"&gt;[[American Psychological Association]]: [http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/sexual-orientation.aspx Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts]&lt;/ref&gt;  They may include behavioral techniques, cognitive behavioral techniques, psychoanalytic techniques, medical approaches, religious and spiritual approaches,&lt;ref name=apaTaskForce&gt;{{cite web|title = Report of the American Psychological Association Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation|url = http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf|accessdate = July 28, 2015|date = September 28, 2009|first1 = Judith M.|last1 = Glassgold|first2 = Lee|last2 = Beckstead|first3 = Jack|last3 = Drescher|authorlink3 = Jack Drescher|first4 = Beverly|last4 = Greene|first5 = Robin Lin|last5 = Miller|first6 = Roger L.|last6 = Worthington|first7 = Clinton W.|last7 = Anderson|publisher = [[American Psychological Association]]|deadurl = no|archive-date = June 15, 2010|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615023708/http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in some parts of the world, acts of sexual violence ("[[corrective rape]]"). According to the American Psychiatric Association Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation, "there are no studies of adequate scientific rigor to conclude whether or not such methods work to change sexual orientation. The longstanding consensus of the behavioral and social sciences, and the health and mental health professions is that homosexuality and bisexuality are ''per se'' normal and positive variations of human sexual orientation."&lt;ref name="apa2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name=PAHO&gt;{{cite web |title="Therapies" to change sexual orientation lack medical justification and threaten health |url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6803&amp;Itemid=1926/ |publisher=[[Pan American Health Organization]] (PAHO) |accessdate=26 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67xKQyixE?url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6803&amp;Itemid=1926/ |archivedate=2012-05-26 |df= }} archived .&lt;/ref&gt; Research consistently failed to provide any empirical or scientific basis for regarding them as disorders or abnormalities.&lt;ref name=maine&gt;[http://www.apa.org/about/offices/ogc/amicus/ra-ma.pdf Brief of ''Amici Curiae'' American Psychological Association; Maine Psychological Association; National Association of Social Workers; National Association of Social Workers, Maine Chapter; Maine Association of Psychiatric Physicians; Child Welfare League of America; Maine Children’s Alliance; Maine Medical Association; American Academy of Pediatrics, Maine Chapter; Evan B.

There is a large body of research evidence that indicates that being gay, lesbian or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health and social adjustment.&lt;ref name="rcp2007" /&gt; Because of this, the major mental health professional organizations do not encourage individuals to try to change their sexual orientation. Indeed, such interventions are ethically suspect because they can be harmful to the psychological well-being of those who attempt them; clinical observations and self-reports indicate that many individuals who unsuccessfully attempt to change their sexual orientation experience considerable psychological distress. For these reasons, no major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Herek"&gt;[http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/gill-v-office-of-personnel-management/2009-11-17-doma-aff-herek.pdf Expert affidavit of Gregory M.

SOCE have been controversial due to tensions between the values held by some right-wing faith-based organizations, on the one hand, and those held by [[LGBT rights]] organizations, human rights and civil rights organizations, and other faith-based organizations, as well as professional and scientific organizations, on the other. Some individuals and groups have, contrary to global scientific research and consensus, promoted the idea of homosexuality as symptomatic of developmental defects or spiritual and moral failings and have argued that SOCE, including psychotherapy and religious efforts, could alter homosexual feelings and behaviors.&lt;ref name="apa2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PAHO /&gt; Such efforts are potentially harmful because they present the view that the sexual orientation of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth is a mental illness or disorder, and they often frame the inability to change one's sexual orientation as a personal and moral failure.&lt;ref name=facts&gt;American Psychological Association: [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/just-the-facts.pdf Just the Facts about Sexual Orientation &amp; Youth: A Primer for Principals, Educators, &amp; School Personnel]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these individuals and groups appeared to be embedded within the larger context of conservative religious political movements that have supported the stigmatization of homosexuality on political or religious grounds.&lt;ref name="apa2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PAHO /&gt;

===Richard von Krafft-Ebing===
{{undue weight|section|date=March 2017}}
[[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] was a German-Austrian psychiatrist and one of the founders of scientific sexology. His first systematic work on sexual pathology was published in 1877 in a German psychiatric journal. His influential work, ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' was published in 1886. Numerous expanded German editions followed, and it was widely translated. Krafft-Ebing became a proponent of the sickness model of homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Rosario&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosario|1997|pp=67–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section IV of ''Psychopathia Sexualis'', “General Pathology“, discussed homosexuality in “Diagnosis, Prognosis and Therapy of Antipathic Sexual Instinct.” Krafft-Ebing believed that homosexuality could be either innate or acquired. In his view, it could sometimes be treated through prevention of [[masturbation]] and cure of the neuroses “arising out of the unhygienic conditions of sexual life”,&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP299&gt;{{Harvnb|Krafft-Ebing|1965|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these methods would work only in rare cases “where acquired antipathic sexual instinct has not progressed far”,&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP299 /&gt; and would therefore usually be ineffective even when homosexuality was not inborn. Krafft-Ebing believed that hypnosis was therefore the "only means of salvation"&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP300&gt;{{Harvnb|Krafft-Ebing|1965|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; in most cases. He stated that he knew of only a single case in which self-hypnosis had proven successful, and that hypnotic suggestion by another person was usually necessary to change homosexuality.

Krafft-Ebing wrote about this method that "...&amp;nbsp;the object of post-hypnotic suggestion is to remove the impulse to masturbation and homosexual feelings, and to encourage heterosexual emotions with a sense of virility".&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP299 /&gt; Krafft-Ebing described three cases in which he believed it had proved satisfactory, writing that they "seem to afford a proof that even the gravest cases of congenital sexual inversion may be benefited by the application of hypnotism".&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP308&gt;{{Harvnb|Krafft-Ebing|1965|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; He warned however that "only when hypnotism produces deep somnambulism decided and lasting results may be hoped for".&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP306&gt;{{Harvnb|Krafft-Ebing|1965|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He rejected castration as a cure for homosexuality, and the internment of gay people in asylums, except in cases involving sex crimes. Krafft-Ebing cautioned that the success or failure of treatments for homosexuality proved nothing about its causes. He defended the right of patients to receive such treatment. Krafft-Ebing criticised several objections to medical treatment of homosexuality, including the charges that it was ineffective and that it gave an opportunity "to tainted individuals to propagate their perversions".&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP306 /&gt; In his view, physicians had a duty to provide such treatment if it was requested.

He concluded his discussion of methods of curing homosexuality by remarking that “in the majority of cases, the patient is quite satisfied when he becomes sexually neutral, and under these circumstances medical skill has rendered a great service to both society and the individual himself.”&lt;ref name=Krafft-EbingP307&gt;{{Harvnb|Krafft-Ebing|1965|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later editions of ''Psychopathia Sexualis'' included an increased number of autobiographies by gay people who made it clear that they did not wish to change their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Rosario" /&gt;

===Current status===
In the last two decades of the 19th century, a different view began to predominate in [[Medicine|medical]] and [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] circles, judging such behavior as indicative of a type of person with a defined and relatively stable [[sexual orientation]]. In the late 19th and 20th centuries, pathological models of homosexuality were standard.

In 1992, the [[World Health Organization]] replaced its categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness with the diagnosis of ego-dystonic homosexuality. The [[UK Government]] followed suit in 1994, followed by the Ministry of Health in [[Russian Federation]] in 1999 and the [[Chinese Society of Psychiatry]] in 2001.

The trustees of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) had previously voted unanimously (13 to 0, with two abstentions) to remove homosexuality as a disorder from the ''Sexual Deviancy'' section of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], the DSM-II in 1973. This decision was officially confirmed by 58% of the general APA membership in 1974, who voted to replace the diagnosis with a milder category of "sexual orientation disturbance". At that time APA stressed that removing homosexuality from the list of psychiatric disorders does not mean it is "normal" or as valuable as heterosexuality. They also stated that modern methods of treatment allow interested homosexuals to change their sexual orientation with a significant degree of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://displus.sk/DSM/subory/dsm2_revision.pdf|title=Homosexuality and Sexual Orientation Disturbance: Proposed Change in DSM-II, 6th Printing, page44 POSITION STATEMENT|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=APA Document ReferenceNo.730008|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 the DSM-III replaced "sexual orientation disturbance" with "ego-dystonic homosexuality" which, in 1986, was deleted from the DSM-III-R. The APA now classifies persistent and marked distress about one's sexual orientation under ''Sexual Disorders Not Otherwise Specified''.

No major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation. These include the American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, American Counseling Association, National Association of Social Workers in the US, the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Australian Psychological Society, and the [[Pan American Health Organization]].

==Reasons why people seek to change sexual orientation==
[[Christian right]] political groups have marketed sexual orientation change [[Direct-to-consumer advertising|directly to consumers]]. In 1998, these groups, including the [[Family Research Council]] and the [[American Family Association]] spent $600,000 on advertising promoting [[conversion therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/how-christians-turned-against-gay-conversion-therapy/390570/|title=How Christians Turned Against Gay Conversion Therapy|author=Jonathan Merritt|date=15 Apr 2015|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/ex-ex-gay-pride-249282|title=Ex-Ex-Gay Pride|work=Newsweek|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A majority of people who attempt to change their sexual orientation come from conservative religious backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolosi, Byrd, &amp; Potts, 2000; Schaeffer, Hyde, Kroencke, McCormick, &amp; Nottebaum, 2000; Schaeffer, Nottebaum, Dech, &amp; Drawczyk, 2000; Spitzer, 2001a).&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Spitzer found that 79% of 200 men and women who said they changed their sexual orientation were motivated by religion, with 93% indicating that religion is "extremely" or "very" important.&lt;ref name=spitzer&gt;Spitzer, 2001a&lt;/ref&gt;  Others indicated their desire came from moral or social values, which may be independent of their religion.&lt;ref name=rosik&gt;{{cite journal

An article in the [[American Medical Association]]'s Journal of Ethics argues that clinicians who care for adolescents face a "common challenge" of parents seeking interventions to change the sexual orientation of their teenage children. The article states that adolescents are increasingly comfortable in revealing their same-sex attraction to their parents because of the "generational shift in views of sexual orientation" due in part to increasing acceptance of [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]] and same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="pmid25397646"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Zachariah P |author2=Blaschke GS |author3=Weddle M | title=A request for "conversion therapy". | journal=Virtual Mentor | year= 2014 | volume= 16 | issue= 11 | pages= 877–83 | pmid=25397646 | doi=10.1001/virtualmentor.2014.16.11.ecas2-1411 | pmc= | url=http://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/2014/11/ecas2-1411.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/162689/record-high-say-gay-lesbian-relations-morally.aspx|title=In U.S., Record-High Say Gay, Lesbian Relations Morally OK|publisher=Gallup|date=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An APA task force found that people often sought out SOCE due to (a) a lack of other sources of social support; (b) a desire for active coping and (c) access to methods of [[sexual orientation identity]] exploration and reconstruction.&lt;ref name="apaTaskForce  "/&gt;  The [[American Psychological Association]] states that harassment and abuse, as well as pressure from family, peers, and religious groups ignorant about and prejudiced against homosexuality, may cause high levels of emotional stress for LGB people. These pressures may lead people to feel forced into attempting to change their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=apa1997&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.apa.org/pi/sexual.html |title=Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation |accessdate=2007-08-28 |date=1997-08-14 |publisher=American Psychological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have found that [[social pressure]] plays a key role in a person's desire to change his or her sexuality.&lt;ref name="shildo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beckstead, A.

==Methods==

===Behavior therapy===
{{See also|Aversion therapy}}
Types of behavior therapy used to change sexual orientation include [[aversion therapy]], covert sensitization and systematic desensitization.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cA1alCqUOUAC&amp;pg=PA134|title=A Short Textbook of Psychiatry|author=Niraj Ahuja|date=30 July 2006|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Publishers|edition=illustrated|isbn=9788180618710}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aversion therapy]] associates negative stimuli with homoerotic pictures and positive stimuli with heteroerotic pictures. A series of 1966 experiments appeared promising, and the practice became popular, but when reports were shown to be flawed, it fell out of favour.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, the [[American Psychological Association]] has declared that aversion therapy is a dangerous practice that does not work, but it is still in use in some countries.&lt;ref name=India&gt;{{cite web

The ethics guidelines of major U.S. mental health organizations vary from cautionary statements about the safety, effectiveness, and dangers of prejudice associated with conversion therapy ([[American Psychological Association]]) to recommending that ethical practitioners refrain from using conversion therapy ([[American Psychiatric Association]]) or referring patients to others who do ([[American Counseling Association]]).

Some people with unwanted homosexual attractions turn to their faith for help. Some conservative Christians believe that homosexuality is a result of a broken world and that faith can change sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lauren Gregory|title=Faith said to change sexual orientation|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2008/dec/28/faith-said-change-sexual-orientation/?local|accessdate=28 July 2015|work=Chattanooga Times Free Press|date=28 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709070024/http://timesfreepress.com/news/2008/dec/28/faith-said-change-sexual-orientation/?local|archivedate=9 July 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some report that their sexual orientation has been changed through the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070710/skepticism-over-validity-of-ex-gay-story-prompts-confessions/index.html|title=Skepticism Over Validity of Ex-Gay Story Prompts 'Confessions'|author=Lillian Kwon|date=10 July 2007|work=Christian Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syntonic therapy===
Syntonic therapy, a method developed by Robert Kronemeyer, was based partly on the work of [[Wilhelm Reich]].

Kronemeyer rejected some earlier methods that were used in attempts to change homosexuality, including [[Conversion therapy#Lobotomy|lobotomy]], electroshock treatment, and [[Aesthetic Realism]].&lt;ref name="Kronemeyer 1980 p. 87"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kronemeyer | first=Robert | title=Overcoming homosexuality | publisher=Macmillan | year=1980 | isbn=978-0-02-566850-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IuEpAQAAMAAJ | p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nazi experiments==
{{See also|Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|Nazi human experimentation}}

During [[the Holocaust]], an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 gay men were imprisoned in concentration camps on the grounds that male homosexuality was deemed incompatible with [[Nazism]]. Some imprisoned homosexuals faced human experimentation by Nazi doctors who sought to find a "medical cure" for homosexuality. No scientific knowledge has been yielded from these experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005261 |title=Persecution of Homosexuals in the Third Reich |publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|USHMM]] |access-date= August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], Nazi doctor [[Carl Værnet]] conducted hormonal experiments on twelve gay men. He made incisions in their [[groin]] and implanted a metal tube that released testosterone over a prolonged period, as he believed that a lack of testosterone was the cause of homosexuality. Although some of the men claimed to have become heterosexual, the results are largely unreliable as many are assumed to have stated they were "cured" in order to be released from the camp. Those who did not show improvement were determined to be "chronic" or "incurable" homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tamagne |first= Florence |date=2004 |title=A History of Homosexuality in Europe Vol. II: Berlin, London, Paris, 1919-1939 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0875863574 |publisher=Algora Publishing |page=290 |isbn=978-0875863573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/homo.html|title=Homosexuals &amp; the Holocaust: Background &amp; Overview|last1= Austin |first1=Ben |last2= |first2= |website=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date= August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of SOCE==
{{over-quotation|section|date=March 2017}}
The American Psychological Association appointed the Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation to review the available research. Ex-gay organizations expressed concerns about the lack of representation of pro-reparative-therapy perspectives on the task force, while alleging that anti-reparative-therapy perspectives were amply represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/jul/11/gay-reparative-therapy-under-scrutiny/ |title=Gay reparative therapy under scrutiny |publisher=Washington Times|location=New York |date=July 11, 2007 |accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The task force reached the following findings:&lt;ref name="apa2009"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recent studies of participants in Sexual Orientation Change Efforts (SOCE) identify a population of individuals who experience serious distress related to same sex sexual attractions. Most of these participants are Caucasian males who report that their religion is extremely important to them (Beckstead &amp; Morrow, 2004; Nicolosi, Byrd, &amp; Potts, 2000; Schaeffer, Hyde, Kroencke, McCormick, &amp; Nottebaum, 2000; Shidlo &amp; Schroeder, 2002, Spitzer, 2003). These individuals report having pursued a variety of religious and secular efforts intended to help them to change their sexual orientation. To date, the research has not fully addressed age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, disability, language, and socioeconomic status in the population of distressed individuals.

There are no studies of adequate scientific rigor to conclude whether or not recent SOCE do or do not work to change a person’s sexual orientation. Scientifically rigorous older work in this area (e.g., Birk, Huddleston, Miller, &amp; Cohler, 1971; James, 1978; McConaghy, 1969, 1976; McConaghy, Proctor, &amp; Barr, 1972; Tanner, 1974, 1975) found that sexual orientation (i.e., erotic attractions and sexual arousal oriented to one sex or the other, or both) was unlikely to change due to efforts designed for this purpose. Some individuals appeared to learn how to ignore or limit their attractions. However, this was much less likely to be true for people whose sexual attractions were initially limited to people of the same sex.

Although sound data on the safety of SOCE are extremely limited, some individuals reported being harmed by SOCE. Distress and depression were exacerbated. Belief in the hope of sexual orientation change followed by the failure of the treatment was identified as a significant cause of distress and negative self-image (Beckstead &amp; Morrow, 2004; Shidlo &amp; Schroeder, 2002).

Although there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation, some individuals modified their sexual orientation identity (i.e., group membership and affiliation), behavior, and values (Nicolosi, Byrd, &amp; Potts, 2000). They did so in a variety of ways and with varied and unpredictable outcomes, some of which were temporary (Beckstead &amp; Morrow, 2004; Shidlo &amp; Schroeder, 2002). Based on the available data, additional claims about the meaning of those outcomes are scientifically unsupported.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD-10]], which is widely used internationally outside of North America (where DSM-IV-TR is used), states that "sexual orientation by itself is not to be regarded as a disorder".&lt;ref name="icd" /&gt;  It lists [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] as a disorder instead, the diagnosis for which is when "the gender identity or sexual preference (heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or prepubertal) is not in doubt, but the individual wishes it were different because of associated psychological and behavioural disorders, and may seek treatment in order to change it."&lt;ref name="icd"&gt;{{cite web

In 2012, the [[Pan American Health Organization]] (the North and South American branch of the [[World Health Organization]]) released a statement cautioning against "services that purport to 'cure' people with non-heterosexual sexual orientations" as they "lack medical justification and represent a serious threat to the health and well-being of affected people", and noted that "there is a professional consensus that homosexuality is a normal and natural variation of human sexuality and cannot be regarded as a pathological condition". The organization further called "on governments, academic institutions, professional associations and the media to expose these practices and to promote respect for diversity." They further noted that adolescents have sometimes been forced to attend these therapies involuntarily, being deprived of their liberty and sometimes kept in isolation for several months, and that these findings were reported by several [[United Nations]] bodies. Additionally, the organization recommended that such malpractices be denounced and subject to sanctions and penalties under national legislation, as they constitute a violation of the ethical principles of health care and violate [[human rights]] that are protected by international and regional agreements.&lt;ref name=PAHO /&gt;

The American Psychiatric Association "affirms that same-sex sexual and romantic attractions, feelings, and behaviors are normal and positive variations of human sexuality regardless of sexual orientation identity; reaffirms its position that homosexuality per se is not a mental disorder and opposes portrayals of sexual minority youths and adults as mentally ill due to their sexual orientation; concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation; encourages mental health professionals to avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts by promoting or promising change in sexual orientation when providing assistance to individuals distressed by their own or others’ sexual orientation; concludes that the benefits reported by participants in sexual orientation change efforts can be gained through approaches that do not attempt to change sexual orientation; concludes that the emerging knowledge on affirmative multiculturally competent treatment provides a foundation for an appropriate evidence-based practice with children, adolescents and adults who are distressed by or seek to change their sexual orientation; advises parents, guardians, young people, and their families to avoid sexual orientation change efforts that portray homosexuality as a mental illness or developmental disorder and to seek psychotherapy, social support and educational services that provide accurate information on sexual orientation and sexuality, increase family and school support, and reduce rejection of sexual minority youth; encourages practitioners to consider the ethical concerns outlined in the 1997 APA Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Response to Sexual Orientation, in particular the following standards and principles: scientific bases for professional judgments, benefit and harm, justice, and respect for people's rights and dignity; encourages practitioners to be aware that age, gender, gender identity, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, religion, disability, language, and socioeconomic status may interact with sexual stigma, and contribute to variations in sexual orientation identity development, expression, and experience; opposes the distortion and selective use of scientific data about homosexuality by individuals and organizations seeking to influence public policy and public opinion and will take a leadership role in responding to such distortions; supports the dissemination of accurate scientific and professional information about sexual orientation in order to counteract bias that is based in lack of knowledge about sexual orientation; and encourages advocacy groups, elected officials, mental health professionals, policy makers, religious professionals and organizations, and other organizations to seek areas of collaboration that may promote the wellbeing of sexual minorities."&lt;ref name="apa2009" /&gt;&lt;!--pretty long-winded sentence. Any good way to break it up?--&gt;

The American Psychiatric Association also states: "It is possible to evaluate the theories which rationalize the conduct of "reparative" and conversion therapies.  Firstly, they are at odds with the scientific position of the American Psychiatric Association which has maintained, since 1973, that homosexuality per se, is not a mental disorder.  The theories of "reparative" therapists define homosexuality as either a developmental arrest, a severe form of psychopathology, or some combination of both.  In recent years, noted practitioners of "reparative" therapy have openly integrated older psychoanalytic theories that pathologize homosexuality with traditional religious beliefs condemning homosexuality. The earliest scientific criticisms of the early theories and religious beliefs informing "reparative" or conversion therapies came primarily from sexology researchers.  Later, criticisms emerged from psychoanalytic sources as well.  There has also been an increasing body of religious thought arguing against traditional, biblical interpretations that condemn homosexuality and which underlie religious types of "reparative" therapy."&lt;ref name=apa2001&gt;American Psychiatric Association: [http://www.dayagainsthomophobia.org/IMG/pdf/2000COPPStatement.pdf Therapies Focused on Attempts to Change Sexual Orientation (Reparative or Conversion Therapies) - Position statement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512012332/http://www.dayagainsthomophobia.org/IMG/pdf/2000COPPStatement.pdf |date=2013-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the Royal College of Psychiatrists states: "The Royal College shares the concern of both the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association that positions espoused by bodies like the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH) in the United States are not supported by science. There is no sound scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed. Furthermore so-called treatments of homosexuality as recommended by NARTH create a setting in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish. The Royal College of Psychiatrists holds the view that lesbian, gay and bisexual people should be regarded as valued members of society who have exactly similar rights and responsibilities as all other citizens."&lt;ref name="royal2009"/&gt;

In [[Australia]], the Australian Psychological Society states: "Even though homosexual orientation is not a mental illness and there is no scientific reason to attempt conversion of lesbians or gays to heterosexual orientation, some individuals may want to change their own sexual orientation or that of another individual (for example, parents seeking therapy for their child). Some therapists who undertake this kind of therapy report that they have changed their client's sexual orientation (from homosexual to heterosexual) in treatment. Close scrutiny of these reports shows that many of the claims come from organisations with an ideological perspective on sexual orientation rather than from mental health researchers. Also, the treatments and their outcomes are poorly documented and the length of time that clients are followed up after the treatment is sometimes too short to be a true reflection of the outcome. In other cases it has been shown that individuals can be assisted to live a heterosexual lifestyle, but that their sexual orientation remains unchanged. In other words, their pattern of arousal to members of the same sex does not alter. The Australian Psychological Society acknowledges the lack of scientific evidence for the usefulness of conversion therapy, and notes that it can in fact be harmful for the individual."&lt;ref name="aps"/&gt;  The [[Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists]]' position statement on SOCE notes that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is prohibited by the College's code of ethics and states that "lesbian, gay, and bisexual people are equally valued members of society who have exactly similar rights and responsibilities as all other citizens."  The College's official position is that it "does not support the use of sexual orientation change efforts of any kind" and mandates that "[m]ental health workers must avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts when providing assistance to people distressed by their own or others’ sexual orientation."&lt;ref name = RANZCP&gt;{{cite web|title = Position Statement 60 &amp;ndash; Sexual Orientation Change Efforts|publisher = [[Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists]]|date = June 2015|url = https://www.ranzcp.org/Files/Resources/College_Statements/Position_Statements/PS-60-PS-Sexual-Orientation-Change-Efforts-(Ju-(1).aspx|accessdate = January 16, 2018|archive-date = September 26, 2015|deadurl = no|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150926222933/https://www.ranzcp.org/Files/Resources/College_Statements/Position_Statements/PS-60-PS-Sexual-Orientation-Change-Efforts-(Ju-(1).aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]], Western psychiatry and psychology were imported during a "Westernization Movement" in the late 19th century. At that time, the West viewed homosexuality as a mental disorder, and that became the prevailing view in China as well. During this period, homosexual sexual behavior was grounds for persecution, a marked change from the attitude of general (but not total) acceptance found in pre-19th-century China. These views lasted throughout the 1970s, despite changed theoretical models of sexuality orientation in the West, during a period when the Chinese government held a "closed-door" policy on information about human sexuality. After 1980, information became more available, and views began to change. In 2000 and under pressure from both the APAs and the ACA, the [[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders]] (CCMD-III) declassified homosexuality, but added a diagnosis resembling [[ego-dystonic sexual orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In [[Italy]], little research has been conducted in the mental health community on homosexuality. Early work tended to describe homosexuality as a pathology or a developmental arrest.

In [[Germany]], the psychiatry, psychology, and sexology establishment from the early 20th century viewed homosexuality as pathological. However, following the increased visibility of the homosexual community during the [[AIDS epidemic]] of the late 1980s and the declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder in the ICD-10, non-pathological, rather than pathological, models of homosexuality became mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In [[Norway]], a country known for its strong LGBT rights legislation, the shift from a pathological to non-pathological understanding of homosexuality began in the 1970s, following the APA's declassification in 1973. In 2000, the General Assembly of the Norwegian Psychiatric Association overwhelmingly voted for the following position statement on sexual orientation change therapy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Homosexuality is no disorder or illness, and can therefore not be subject to treatment. A ‘treatment’ with the only aim of changing sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual must be regarded as ethical malpractice, and has no place in the health system.&lt;ref name=norway&gt;{{cite journal

==Debate==
Changing sexuality has become highly politicized, and the ensuing debates "have obscured the scientific data by calling into question the motives and even the character of individuals on both sides of the issue."&lt;ref name="Psych" /&gt;  The ethics, efficacy, benefits, and potential for harm of SOCE are under extensive debate, both in the professional literature and the popular media.&lt;ref name=apa1997 /&gt;  Concerns have been expressed about forcing people to undergo SOCE against their will, blocking people who are seeking to change their sexual orientation from attempting to do so, and concern over the way SOCE is being promoted affects LGB rights.

The [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] says psychoanalytic SOCE often causes psychological pain by reinforcing [[internalized homophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf|title=Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation|last=Glassgold|first=Judith|author2=Lee Beckstead |author3=Jack Drescher |author4=Beverly Greene |author5=Robin Lin Miller |author6=Roger L.

Anderson |year=2009|accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists has stated that the harm that SOCE "therapies can cause to individuals, the contribution they make to the misrepresentation of homosexuality as a mental disorder, and the prejudice and discrimination that can flourish through the use of such therapies has led all major medical organisations to oppose the use of sexual orientation change efforts".&lt;ref name = RANZCP /&gt;

===Forced SOCE===
Until the 1970s, homosexuality was considered a mental illness and homosexuals were forced by the government to undergo treatment.&lt;ref name="ucdavis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_mental_health.html|title=Homosexuality and Mental Health|date=|work=ucdavis.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2015}} Famous cases include [[Alan Turing]]. This practice is outlawed in most of the world, but human right groups have complained that in some parts of the world, treatment is still being forced upon unwilling patients.&lt;ref name="India"/&gt;

In one of the few published U.S. cases dealing with conversion therapy, the Ninth Circuit addressed the topic in the context of an asylum application. A Russian citizen "had been apprehended by the Russian militia, registered at a clinic as a 'suspected lesbian,' and forced to undergo treatment for lesbianism, such as 'sedative drugs' and hypnosis." The Ninth Circuit held that the conversion treatments to which Pitcherskaia had been subjected constituted mental and physical torture. The court rejected the argument that the treatments to which Pitcherskaia had been subjected did not constitute persecution because they had been intended to help her, not harm her, stating that "human rights laws cannot be sidestepped by simply couching actions that torture mentally or physically in benevolent terms such as 'curing' or 'treating' the victims."&lt;ref name="Gans"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gans |first=Laura A. |title=Inverts, Perverts, and Converts: Sexual Orientation Conversion Therapy and Liability |date=Winter 1999 |journal=The Boston University Public Interest Law Journal |volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been few, if any, [[medical malpractice]] lawsuits filed on the basis of conversion therapy. Laura A. Gans suggested in an article published in ''The Boston University Public Interest Law Journal'' that this is due to an "historic reluctance of consumers of mental health services to sue their care givers" and "the difficulty associated with establishing the elements of... causation and harm... given the intangible nature of psychological matters." Gans also suggested that a [[tort]] cause of action for [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] might be sustainable against therapists who use conversion therapy on patients who specifically say that his or her anxiety does not arise from his or her sexuality.

Another concern is unwilling patients, particularly children, being forced into SOCE. Children experience significant pressure to conform with sexual norms, particularly from their peers, and often lack adequate legal protection from coercive treatment.&lt;ref name=apa1997 /&gt;

In 2005, [[Love In Action]], an ex-gay ministry based in Memphis, was investigated by the Tennessee Department of Health and the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities for providing counseling and mental health care without a license, and for treating adolescents without their consent.

===Voluntary SOCE===
[[Gregory M. Herek]], a professor of psychology at the University of California, Davis, wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Few would dispute that some people’s sexual orientation changes during their lifetime. Indeed, many lesbians and gay men report living as a heterosexual before recognizing or developing their homosexual orientation. The question at issue is not whether sexual orientation can change but whether interventions can be designed to bring about such change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stolaf.edu/people/huff/classes/Psych130F2010/LabDocuments/SpitzerComme|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805152015/http://www.stolaf.edu/people/huff/classes/Psych130F2010/LabDocuments/SpitzerComme|deadurl=yes|title=St. Olaf College|date=5 August 2012|archivedate=5 August 2012|publisher=|accessdate=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They advocate compassion and respect specifically for ex-homosexuals and those on that path, and policy neutrality in creating laws that would inhibit freedom of speech to discuss SOCE.

The American Psychological Association and the Royal College of Psychiatrists expressed concerns that the positions espoused by NARTH and Focus on the Family are not supported by the science and create an environment in which prejudice and discrimination can flourish.&lt;ref name="royal2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apaexgay"/&gt; The Just the Facts Coalition, consisting of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], [[American Association of School Administrators]], [[American Counseling Association]], [[American Federation of Teachers]], [[American Psychological Association]], American School Counselor Association, [[American School Health Association]], Interfaith Alliance Foundation, [[National Association of School Psychologists]], [[National Association of Secondary School Principals]], [[National Association of Social Workers]], [[National Education Association]], and the School Social Work Association of America, in 2008 released ''Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation and Youth''. In it, they expressed concern that the advancement of SOCE may cause social harm by disseminating inaccurate views about sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=JustTheFacts&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/justthefacts.html |title=Just the Facts About Sexual Orientation &amp; Youth: A Primer for Principals, Educators and School Personnel |accessdate=2007-08-28 |year=1999 |publisher=Just the Facts Coalition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force has described the recent support for sexual orientation change efforts as "the Christian Right repackag[ing] its anti-gay campaign in kinder, gentler terms. Instead of simply denouncing homosexuals as morally and socially corrupt, the Christian Right has now shifted to a strategy of emphasizing ... the ex-gay movement. Behind this mask of compassion, however, the goal remains the same: to roll back legal protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people ..."&lt;ref name="challenge"&gt;{{cite web

Psychologist John Gonsiorek said the way in which the Christian right promoted SOCE was hypocritical. He wrote "some conservative Christian institutions actively foster social conditions to maximize distress for such clients about their sexual orientations, and these institutions simultaneously promote conversion therapy as the solution to this distress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

And that's a problem. It's an imbalance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Legal status==
Some jurisdictions have made it illegal or are considering to make it illegal to engage in sexual orientation change efforts.

Conversion therapy became an issue during the [[Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey|2017 postal survey]] that led to the [[Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017|legalisation]] of [[same-sex marriage in Australia]].  [[Lyle Shelton]], the then-head of the [[Australian Christian Lobby]], declared that parents should have the option to send their children to gay conversion therapy, drawing strong criticism including from other Christian groups.&lt;ref name = Shelton&gt;{{cite news|title = Gay marriage: Lyle Shelton's gay conversion therapy claim raises concerns|first1 = Danielle|last1 = Le Messurer|first2 = Claire|last2 = Bickers|publisher = [[News Corp Australia]]|website = news.com.au|date = September 15, 2017|accessdate = March 17, 2018|url = http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/gay-marriage/gay-marriage-lyle-sheltons-gay-conversion-therapy-claim-raises-concerns/news-story/ce73079d939231393425c816fff02f79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Christian Leaders Hit Back At Lyle Shelton Over Gay Conversion Therapy Remarks|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/christian-leaders-hit-back|date = September 15, 2017|accessdate = March 17, 2018|first = Lane|last = Sainty|work = [[BuzzFeed]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shelton also criticised the Victorian laws as "curtailing choice" and argued that parental choice should be respected in deciding what is best for their children.&lt;ref name = Shelton /&gt;  Shortly afterwards, [[Western Australia]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] both decided to examine the adequacy of their laws in relation to conversion therapy.&lt;ref name = Hack2 /&gt;

===Ecuador===
In November 2011, an Ecuadorean activist group, called Fundación Causana, began a petition on [[Change.org]] to entreat the Ecuadorean minister of health to close down more than 200 illegal "ex-gay clinics". The group claimed that the clinics abuse and torture patients in an effort to "cure homosexuality". The clinics primarily targeted [[lesbian]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Lesbian Torture Clinics in Ecuador- Claiming to "Cure" Them | work=Hispanically Speaking News | publisher=[[Hispanically Speaking News]] | url=http://www.hispanicallyspeakingnews.com/notitas-de-noticias/details/lesbian-torture-clinics-in-ecuador-claiming-to-cure-them/11469/ | date=5 November 2011 | accessdate=17 January 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212001139/http://www.hispanicallyspeakingnews.com/notitas-de-noticias/details/lesbian-torture-clinics-in-ecuador-claiming-to-cure-them/11469/ | archivedate=12 December 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and operated under the guise of being drug rehabilitation centers.&lt;ref name="Huffington"&gt;{{cite web | title=Why 200 Lesbian Torture Clinics Are Still Operating in Ecuador | work=The Huffington Post | publisher=[[The Huffington Post]] | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/emilia-gutierrez/ecuador-lesbian-torture-clinics_b_1087533.html | date =11 November 2011 | accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one pair of parents discovered the abuse and asked for the clinic to release their daughter, Paola Ziritti, but were denied. Ziritti was eventually released after two years of confinement and was the first to press a formal complaint against the clinics.&lt;ref name="Huffington"/&gt;

Activists consequently called on the government to close down the clinics, but as of August 2011, only 27 had been closed while a reported 207 clinics remained open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Lesbians Escape From Ecuador's "Ex-Gay" Torture Centers | work=The Advocate | publisher=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] | url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/10/07/Lesbians_Escape_From_Ecuadors_ExGay_Torture_Centers | date=7 October 2011 | accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 2012, the Change.org petition was closed and marked as a success with 113,761 international signatures. The petition also was updated with a statement from Fundacion Causana reading,
&lt;blockquote&gt;After ten years of outcry, the nation of Ecuador - through the Ministry of Public Health - has entered into a commitment with civic organizations and society in general to deconstruct the belief that homosexuality is an illness and root out the use of torture in these clinics. We extend our thanks to all the men and women who signed our petition. It has been invaluable to have this support in starting to change this reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Carina Vance Mafla]]'s ministry of health shortly thereafter raided three clinics in the vicinity of Quito and rescued dozens of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | publisher=MSNBC | date=25 January 2012 | url=http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/01/25/10237126-rights-groups-hail-ecuadors-crackdown-on-lesbian-torture-clinics | title=Rights groups hail Ecuador's crackdown on lesbian 'torture clinics' | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610071713/http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/01/25/10237126-rights-groups-hail-ecuadors-crackdown-on-lesbian-torture-clinics | archivedate=10 June 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the art medium|social practice (art)}}

'''Social artistry''' is the attempt to address or recognize a particular social issue using art and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyeglobal.org/social-artists/ Social Artists]&lt;/ref&gt; Social artists are people who use creative skills to work with people or organizations in their community to affect change.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Houston [http://www.jeanhouston.org/Social-Artistry/social-artistry.html Social Artistry]&lt;/ref&gt; While a traditional artist uses their creative skills to express their take on the world, a social artist puts their skills to use to help promote and improve communities. Thus, the main aim of a social artist is to improve society as a whole and to help other people find their own means of creative expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialartistryinstitute.org/who_we_are.htm Institute of Social Artistry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social artists may address issues such as youth alienation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyeglobal.org/creative-youth-camps/ Creative Youth Camps]&lt;/ref&gt; or the breakdown of communities.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Houston [http://education.jhu.edu/research/newhorizons/future/articles/social-artistry/index.html Social Artistry]&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, social artists will address these problems by helping people express themselves and find their voice, or by bringing people together and using art to help them to foster an understanding of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Wenger-Trayner [http://wenger-trayner.com/resources/social-artists/ Social Artists]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social artistry can incorporate several different art forms including [[theatre]], [[poetry]], [[music]] and [[Visual arts|visual art]]. 

Findings from 2013 confirm the shift from individual expression to community engagement, or "from autonomous to socially engaged."&lt;ref&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work,' in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Lingo and Tepper cite several examples:

In the [[finite element method]] for the numerical solution of elliptic [[partial differential equations]], the '''stiffness matrix''' represents the system of linear equations that must be solved in order to ascertain an approximate solution to the differential equation.

==The stiffness matrix for the Poisson problem==
For simplicity, we will first consider the [[Poisson problem]]

:&lt;math&gt; -\nabla^2 u = f&lt;/math&gt;

on some domain Ω, subject to the boundary condition ''u'' = 0 on the boundary of Ω. To discretize this equation by the finite element method, one chooses a set of ''basis functions'' {''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} defined on Ω which also vanish on the boundary. One then approximates

:&lt;math&gt; u \approx u^h = u_1\varphi_1+\cdots+u_n\varphi_n.&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are determined so that the error in the approximation is orthogonal to each basis function ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_\Omega \varphi_i\cdot f \, dx = -\int_\Omega \varphi_i\nabla^2u^h \, dx = -\sum_j\left(\int_\Omega \varphi_i\nabla^2\varphi_j\,dx\right)\, u_j = \sum_j\left(\int_\Omega \nabla\varphi_i\cdot\nabla\varphi_j\, dx\right)u_j.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''stiffness matrix''' is the n-element square matrix A defined by

:&lt;math&gt; A_{ij} = \int_\Omega\nabla\varphi_i\cdot\nabla\varphi_j\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

By defining the vector ''F'' with components ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega\varphi_i f\,dx&lt;/math&gt;, the coefficients ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are determined by the linear system ''AU'' = ''F''. The stiffness matrix is symmetric, i.e. ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt;, so all its eigenvalues are real. Moreover, it is a strictly [[positive-definite matrix]], so that the system ''AU'' = ''F'' always has a unique solution. (For other problems, these nice properties will be lost.)

Note that the stiffness matrix will be different depending on the computational grid used for the domain and what type of finite element is used. For example, the stiffness matrix when piecewise quadratic finite elements are used will have more degrees of freedom than piecewise linear elements.

==The stiffness matrix for other problems==
Determining the stiffness matrix for other PDE follows essentially the same procedure, but it can be complicated by the choice of boundary conditions. As a more complex example, consider the elliptic equation

:&lt;math&gt; -\sum_{k,l}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_k}\left(a^{kl}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_l}\right) = f&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A''(''x'') = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''kl''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is a positive-definite matrix defined for each point ''x'' in the domain. We impose  the [[Robin boundary condition]]

:&lt;math&gt; -\sum_{k,l}\nu_k a^{kl}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_l} = c(u-g),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ν''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the component of the unit outward normal vector ''ν'' in the ''k''-th direction. The system to be solved is

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_j\left(\sum_{k,l}\int_\Omega a^{kl}\frac{\partial\varphi_i}{\partial x_k}\frac{\partial\varphi_j}{\partial x_l}dx+\int_{\partial\Omega}c\varphi_i\varphi_j\, ds\right)u_j = \int_\Omega\varphi_i f\, dx+\int_{\partial\Omega}c\varphi_i g\, ds,&lt;/math&gt;

as can be shown using an analogue of Green's identity. The coefficients ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are still found by solving a system of linear equations, but the matrix representing the system is markedly different from that for the ordinary Poisson problem.

In general, to each scalar elliptic operator ''L'' of order 2''k'', there is associated a bilinear form ''B'' on the [[Sobolev space]] ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, so that the [[weak formulation]] of the equation ''Lu'' = ''f'' is

:&lt;math&gt; B[u,v] = (f,v)&lt;/math&gt;

for all functions ''v'' in ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;. Then the stiffness matrix for this problem is

:&lt;math&gt; A_{ij} = B[\varphi_j,\varphi_i].&lt;/math&gt;

==Practical assembly of the stiffness matrix==
In order to implement the finite element method on a computer, one must first choose a set of basis functions and then compute the integrals defining the stiffness matrix. Usually, the domain Ω is discretized by some form of [[mesh generation]], wherein it is divided into non-overlapping triangles or quadrilaterals, which are generally referred to as elements. The basis functions are then chosen to be polynomials of some order within each element, and continuous across element boundaries. The simplest choices are piecewise linear for triangular elements and piecewise bilinear for rectangular elements.

The '''element stiffness matrix''' ''A''&lt;sup&gt;[''k'']&lt;/sup&gt; for element ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the matrix

:&lt;math&gt; A^{[k]}_{ij} = \int_{T_k}\nabla\varphi_i\cdot\nabla\varphi_j\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

The element stiffness matrix is zero for most values of i and j, for which the corresponding basis functions are zero within ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. The full stiffness matrix ''A'' is the sum of the element stiffness matrices. In particular, for basis functions that are only supported locally, the stiffness matrix is [[sparse matrix|sparse]].

For many standard choices of basis functions, i.e. piecewise linear basis functions on triangles, there are simple formulas for the element stiffness matrices. For example, for piecewise linear elements, consider a triangle with vertices (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), (''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and define the 2×3 matrix

:&lt;math&gt; D = \left[\begin{matrix}x_3 - x_2 &amp; x_1 - x_3 &amp; x_2 - x_1 \\ y_3 - y_2 &amp; y_1 - y_3 &amp; y_2 - y_1\end{matrix}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Then the element stiffness matrix is

:&lt;math&gt; A^{[k]} = D^\mathsf{T} D/(4 \operatorname{area}(T)).&lt;/math&gt;

When the differential equation is more complicated, say by having an inhomogeneous diffusion coefficient, the integral defining the element stiffness matrix can be evaluated by [[Gaussian quadrature]].

The [[condition number]] of the stiffness matrix depends strongly on the quality of the numerical grid. In particular, triangles with small angles in the finite element mesh induce large eigenvalues of the stiffness matrix, degrading the solution quality.

'''Stochastic Petri nets''' are a form of [[Petri net]] where the transitions fire after a probabilistic delay determined by a [[random variable]].  

==Definition==
A ''stochastic Petri net'' is a five-tuple ''SPN'' = (''P'', ''T'', ''F'', ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Λ'') where:
# ''P'' is a set of states, called ''places''.
# ''T'' is a set of ''transitions''.
# ''F'' where ''F'' &lt;big&gt;⊂&lt;/big&gt; (''P'' × ''T'') &lt;big&gt;∪&lt;/big&gt; (''T'' × ''P'') is a set of flow relations called "arcs" between places and transitions (and between transitions and places).
# ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''initial marking''.
# ''Λ = '' is the array of ''firing rates λ'' associated with the transitions. The firing rate, a [[random variable]], can also be a function λ(''M'') of the current marking.

==Correspondence to Markov process==
The [[reachability]] graph of stochastic Petri nets can be mapped directly to a [[Markov process]]. It satisfies the [[Markov property]], since its states depend only on the current marking. 
Each state in the reachability graph is mapped to a state in the Markov process, and the firing of a transition with firing rate λ corresponds to a Markov state transition with probability λ.

[[File:Penang island.stl|thumb|[[STL (file format)|STL 3D model]] of [[Penang Island]] terrain based on [[Advanced_Spaceborne_Thermal_Emission_and_Reflection_Radiometer#ASTER_Global_Digital_Elevation_Model|ASTER Global DEM]] data]]
'''Terrain rendering''' covers a variety of methods of depicting real-world or [[imaginary world]] [[planetary surface|surface]]s. Most common [[terrain]] [[Artistic rendering|rendering]] is the depiction of [[Earth]]'s surface.

It is used in various applications to give an observer a [[frame of reference]]. It is also often used in combination with rendering of non-terrain objects, such as [[tree]]s, [[building]]s, [[river]]s, etc.

There are two major modes of terrain rendering: [[Top-down perspective|top-down]] and [[perspective (geometry)|perspective]] rendering. Top-down terrain rendering has been known for centuries in the way of [[cartographic]] maps. Perspective terrain rendering has also been known for quite some time. However, only with the advent of computers and [[computer graphics]] perspective rendering has become mainstream.

Perspective terrain rendering is described in this article.

==Structure==
A typical terrain rendering application consists of a terrain [[database]], a [[central processing unit]] (CPU), a dedicated [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU), and a display. A [[software application]] is configured to start at initial location in the [[world space]]. The output of the application is screen space representation of the real world on a display. The software application uses the CPU to identify and load terrain data corresponding to initial location from the terrain database, then applies the required [[transformation (geometry)|transformations]] to build a [[polygon mesh|mesh]] of points that can be rendered by the GPU, which completes geometrical transformations, creating screen space objects (such as [[polygon]]s) that create a picture closely resembling the location of the real world.

==Texture==
There are a number of ways to [[texture mapping|texture]] the terrain surface. Some applications benefit from using artificial textures, such as elevation coloring, [[checkerboard]], or other generic textures. Some applications attempt to recreate the real-world surface to the best possible representation using [[aerial photography]] and [[satellite imagery]].

In [[video games]], [[texture splatting]] is used to texture the terrain surface.

==Generation==
{{main|Scenery generator}}
There are a great variety of methods to generate terrain surfaces. The main problem solved by all these methods is managing number of processed and rendered polygons. It is possible to create a very detailed picture of the world using billions of data points. However such applications are limited to static pictures. Most uses of terrain rendering are moving images, which require the software application to make decisions on how to simplify (by discarding or approximating) source terrain data. Virtually all terrain rendering applications use [[level of detail]] to manage number of data points processed by CPU and GPU. There are  several modern algorithms for terrain surfaces generating.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart J. (1999), “Fast Horizon Computation at All Points of a Terrain With Visibility and Shading Applications”,  IEEE Transactions on visualization and computer graphics 4(1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bashkov E., Zori S., Suvorova I. (2000), “Modern Methods of Environment Visual Simulation”, In    Simulationstechnik, 14. Symposium in Hamburg SCS, pp. 509-514. Europe BVBA, Ghent, Belgium,

==Applications==
Terrain rendering is widely used in [[computer game]]s to represent both Earth's surface and imaginary worlds. Some games also have [[terrain deformation]] (or deformable terrain).

One important application of terrain rendering is in [[synthetic vision]] systems. Pilots flying aircraft benefit greatly from the ability to see terrain surface at all times regardless of conditions outside the aircraft.
