&lt;!-- Terminology --&gt;
'''Abortion''' is the ending of [[pregnancy]] due to removing an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] before it can [[fetal viability|survive outside the uterus]].&lt;ref name="definition" group="note" /&gt; An abortion that occurs spontaneously is also known as a [[miscarriage]]. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an [[#Induced|induced abortion]], or less frequently an "induced miscarriage". The word ''abortion'' is often used to mean only induced abortions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/abortion|title=Abortion (noun)|publisher=Oxford Living Dictionaries|accessdate=8 June 2018|quote=''[mass noun]'' The deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, most often performed during the first 28 weeks of pregnancy}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar procedure after the fetus could potentially survive outside the [[womb]] is known as a "[[late termination of pregnancy]]" or less accurately as a "late term abortion".&lt;ref name=stuart&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=DA |last2=Stuart |first2=G |title=Abortion jabberwocky: the need for better terminology |journal=Contraception |year=2010 |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=93–6 |pmid=20103443 |doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2009.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical abortions are those induced by [[abortifacient]] pharmaceuticals. Medical abortion became an alternative method of abortion with the availability of [[prostaglandin]] [[prostaglandin analogue|analogs]] in the 1970s and the [[antiprogestin|antiprogestogen]] [[mifepristone]] (also known as RU-486) in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=1st_Methods/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kapp2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kulier 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kulier R, Kapp N, Gülmezoglu AM, Hofmeyr GJ, Cheng L, Campana A |title=Medical methods for first trimester abortion|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |year=2011 |issue=11 |page=CD002855 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002855.pub4 |pmid=22071804 |volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Creinin 2009"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Creinin MD, Gemzell-Danielsson K |year=2009|chapter=Medical abortion in early pregnancy|veditors=Paul M, Lichtenberg ES, Borgatta L, Grimes DA, Stubblefield PG, Creinin MD |title=Management of unintended and abnormal pregnancy: comprehensive abortion care|location=Oxford|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=111–134|isbn=1-4051-7696-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kapp 2009"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Kapp N, von Hertzen H |year=2009|chapter=Medical methods to induce abortion in the second trimester|veditors=Paul M, Lichtenberg ES, Borgatta L, Grimes DA, Stubblefield PG, Creinin MD |title=Management of unintended and abnormal pregnancy: comprehensive abortion care|location=Oxford|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|pages=178–192|isbn=1-4051-7696-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common early first-trimester medical abortion regimens use mifepristone in combination with a prostaglandin analog ([[misoprostol]] or [[gemeprost]]) up to 9 weeks gestational age, [[methotrexate]] in combination with a prostaglandin analog up to 7 weeks gestation, or a prostaglandin analog alone.&lt;ref name="Kulier 2011"/&gt; Mifepristone–misoprostol combination regimens work faster and are more effective at later gestational ages than methotrexate–misoprostol combination regimens, and combination regimens are more effective than misoprostol alone.&lt;ref name="Creinin 2009"/&gt; This regime is effective in the second trimester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wildschut|first=H|author2=Both, MI|author3= Medema, S|author4= Thomee, E|author5= Wildhagen, MF|author6= Kapp, N|title=Medical methods for mid-trimester termination of pregnancy.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=19 January 2011|issue=1|pages=CD005216|pmid=21249669|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005216.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical abortion regiments involving mifepristone followed by misoprostol in the cheek between 24 and 48 hours later are effective when performed before 63 days' gestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=MJ|last2=Creinin|first2=MD|title=Mifepristone With Buccal Misoprostol for Medical Abortion: A Systematic Review.|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=July 2015|volume=126|issue=1|pages=12–21|doi=10.1097/AOG.0000000000000897|pmid=26241251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 15 weeks' gestation, [[suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]] or [[vacuum aspiration]] are the most common surgical methods of induced abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Healthwise |url=http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp#tw1112 |title=Manual and vacuum aspiration for abortion |year=2004 |publisher=[[WebMD]] |accessdate=5 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070211155626/http://www.webmd.com/hw/womens_conditions/tw1078.asp| archivedate=11 February 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Manual vacuum aspiration'' (MVA) consists of removing the [[fetus]] or [[embryo]], [[placenta]], and membranes by suction using a manual syringe, while ''electric vacuum aspiration'' (EVA) uses an electric pump. These techniques differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, in how early in pregnancy they can be used, and in whether [[cervical dilation]] is necessary.

MVA, also known as "mini-suction" and "[[menstrual extraction]]", can be used in very early pregnancy, and does not require cervical dilation. [[Dilation and curettage]] (D&amp;C), the second most common method of surgical abortion, is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. [[Curettage]] refers to cleaning the walls of the [[uterus]] with a [[curette]]. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends this procedure, also called ''sharp curettage,'' only when MVA is unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[World Health Organization]] |chapter=Dilatation and curettage |chapterurl=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Dilatetion_P61_P63.html |title=Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth: A Guide for Midwives and Doctors |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |location=Geneva |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-92-4-154587-7 |oclc=181845530 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 15th week of gestation until approximately the 26th, other techniques must be used. [[Dilation and evacuation]] (D&amp;E) consists of opening the [[cervix]] of the uterus and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction. After the 16th week of gestation, abortions can also be induced by [[intact dilation and extraction]] (IDX) (also called intrauterine cranial decompression), which requires surgical decompression of the fetus's head before evacuation. IDX is sometimes called "[[partial-birth abortion]]", which has been [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|federally banned]] in the United States.

In the third trimester of pregnancy, induced abortion may be performed surgically by [[intact dilation and extraction]] or by hysterotomy. [[Hysterotomy abortion]] is a procedure similar to a [[caesarean section]] and is performed under [[general anesthesia]]. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and is used during later stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=McGee |first=Glenn |authorlink=Glenn McGee |author2=[[Jon F.

First-trimester procedures can generally be performed using [[local anesthesia]], while second-trimester methods may require [[Sedation#Levels of sedation|deep sedation]] or [[general anesthesia]].&lt;ref name="NEJMDec2011"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Templeton |first1=A. |last2=Grimes |first2=D.

===Labor induction abortion===

In places lacking the necessary medical skill for dilation and extraction, or where preferred by practitioners, an abortion can be induced by first [[Labor induction|inducing labor]] and then [[Late termination of pregnancy#Methods|inducing fetal demise]] if necessary.&lt;ref name=GLOWM_Late&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borgatta|first1=L|journal=Global Library of Women's Medicine|date=December 2014|volume=GLOWM.10444|doi=10.3843/GLOWM.10444|url=http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Labor%20Induction%20Termination%20of%20Pregnancy/item/443|accessdate=25 September 2015|title=Labor Induction Termination of Pregnancy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924082507/http://www.glowm.com/section_view/heading/Labor%20Induction%20Termination%20of%20Pregnancy/item/443|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes called "induced miscarriage". This procedure may be performed from 13 weeks gestation to the third trimester. Although it is very uncommon in the United States, more than 80% of induced abortions throughout the second trimester are labor induced abortions in Sweden and other nearby countries.&lt;ref name=Labor_Induced_Abortion&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Society of Family Planning|title=Clinical Guidelines, Labor induction abortion in the second trimester|journal=Contraception|date=February 2011|volume=84|issue=1|pages=4–18|doi=10.1016/j.contraception.2011.02.005|url=http://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(11)00057-6/pdf|quote="10. What is the effect of feticide on labor induction abortion outcome? Deliberately causing demise of the fetus before labor induction abortion is performed primarily to avoid transient fetal survival after expulsion; this approach may be for the comfort of both the woman and the staff, to avoid futile resuscitation efforts. Some providers allege that feticide also facilitates delivery, although little data support this claim. Transient fetal survival is very unlikely after intraamniotic installation of saline or urea, which are directly feticidal. Transient survival with misoprostol for labor induction abortion at greater than 18 weeks ranges from 0% to 50% and has been observed in up to 13% of abortions performed with high-dose oxytocin. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of transient fetal survival with labor induction abortion include increasing gestational age, decreasing abortion interval and the use of nonfeticidal inductive agents such as the PGE1 analogues."|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only limited data are available comparing this method with dilation and extraction.&lt;ref name=Labor_Induced_Abortion/&gt;  Unlike D&amp;E, labor induced abortions after 18 weeks may be complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival, which may be legally characterized as live birth. For this reason, labor induced abortion is legally risky in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Labor_Induced_Abortion/&gt;&lt;ref name=NAF_2015_Policy&gt;{{cite journal|title=2015 Clinical Policy Guidelines|publisher=National Abortion Federation|date=2015|url=http://prochoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2015_NAF_CPGs.pdf|accessdate=30 October 2015|quote=Policy Statement: Medical induction abortion is a safe and effective method for termination of pregnancies beyond the first trimester when performed by trained clinicians in medical offices, freestanding clinics, ambulatory surgery centers, and hospitals.

===Other methods===
Historically, a number of herbs reputed to possess abortifacient properties have been used in [[folk medicine]]. Among these are: [[tansy]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], [[black cohosh]], and the now-extinct [[silphium]].&lt;ref name="riddle2"&gt;{{Cite book|first=John M. |last=Riddle |title=Eve's herbs: a history of contraception and abortion in the West |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |year=1997|isbn=978-0-674-27024-4 |oclc=36126503}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44–47,62–63,154–155,230–231}}

However, modern users of these plants often lack knowledge of the proper use and dosage.  The historian of medicine [[John M. Riddle|John Riddle]] has spoken of the "broken chain of knowledge,"&lt;ref name="riddle2"/&gt;{{rp|167–205}}
and historian of science [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]] has written,&lt;ref name="ahk"&gt;{{cite book | last=Koblitz | first=Ann Hibner | title=Sex and Herbs and Birth Control: Women and Fertility Regulation Through the Ages | publisher=Kovalevskaia Fund | year=2014 | isbn=978-0989665506}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125}}
{{Quote|
U.S. women of European descent have perhaps become particularly ignorant about the wealth of herbal remedies that previous generations accumulated over the centuries.  And sometimes their fumbling attempts to recover the knowledge can be disastrous.

For example, in 1978 one woman in Colorado died and another was seriously injured when they attempted to procure an abortion by taking pennyroyal oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Pennyroyal oil poisoning and hepatoxicity | journal=Journal of the American Medical Association | year=1979|volume=242|issue=26|pages=2873–2874|doi=10.1001/jama.1979.03300260043027| last1=Sullivan | first1=John B. |first2=Barry H. |last2=Rumack |first3=Harold Jr|last3=Thomas|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Because the indiscriminant use of herbs as abortifacients can cause serious—even lethal—side effects, such as [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|multiple organ failure]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ciganda C, Laborde A |title=Herbal infusions used for induced abortion |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=235–239 |year=2003 |pmid=12807304 |doi=10.1081/CLT-120021104 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such use is not recommended by physicians.

Abortion is sometimes attempted by causing trauma to the abdomen.

Reported methods of unsafe, [[self-induced abortion]] include misuse of [[misoprostol]], and insertion of non-surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hangers into the uterus. These and other methods to terminate pregnancy may be called "induced miscarriage".

With each decade of the past fifty years the actual and proportionate frequency of this accident [perforation of the uterus] has increased, due, first, to the increase in the number of instrumentally induced abortions; second, to the proportionate increase in abortions handled by doctors as against those handled by midwives; and, third, to the prevailing tendency to use instruments instead of the finger in emptying the uterus.

Women seeking to terminate their pregnancies sometimes resort to unsafe methods, particularly when access to legal abortion is restricted. They may attempt to [[self-induced abortion|self-abort]] or rely on another person who does not have proper medical training or access to proper facilities.

==Incidence==
There are two commonly used methods of measuring the incidence of abortion:
* Abortion rate&amp;nbsp;– number of abortions per 1000 women between 15 and 44 years of age
* Abortion percentage&amp;nbsp;– number of abortions out of 100 known pregnancies (pregnancies include live births, abortions and miscarriages)

In many places, where abortion is illegal or carries a heavy social stigma, medical reporting of abortion is not reliable.&lt;ref name="Sedgh 2007"/&gt; For this reason, estimates of the incidence of abortion must be made without determining certainty related to standard error.&lt;ref name="Sedgh 2012" /&gt;

The number of abortions performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in recent years, with 41.6&amp;nbsp;million having been performed in 2003 and 43.8&amp;nbsp;million having been performed in 2008.&lt;ref name="Sedgh 2012" /&gt; The abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women, though it was 24 per 1000 women for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women for developing countries.&lt;ref name="Sedgh 2012" /&gt; The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Sedgh 2012" /&gt;

On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely.&lt;ref name=IJGO10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Shah I, Ahman E |title=Unsafe abortion: global and regional incidence, trends, consequences, and challenges |journal=Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=1149–58 |date=December 2009 |pmid=20085681 |doi= 10.1016/s1701-2163(16)34376-6|quote=However, a woman's chance of having an abortion is similar whether she lives in a developed or a developing region: in 2003 the rates were 26 abortions per 1000 women aged 15 to 44 in developed areas and 29 per 1000 in developing areas.

The rate of legal, induced abortion varies extensively worldwide. According to the report of employees of Guttmacher Institute it ranged from 7 per 1000 women (Germany and Switzerland) to 30 per 1000 women (Estonia) in countries with complete statistics in 2008. The proportion of pregnancies that ended in induced abortion ranged from about 10% (Israel, the Netherlands and Switzerland) to 30% (Estonia) in the same group, though it might be as high as 36% in Hungary and Romania, whose statistics were deemed incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sedgh |first1=G. |last2=Singh |first2=S. |last3=Henshaw |first3=S.

The abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortions a woman has during her reproductive years; this is referred to as ''total abortion rate'' (TAR).

===Gestational age and method===

Abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. In 2003, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reported that 26% of reported legal induced abortions in the United States were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks' gestation, 18% at 7 weeks, 15% at 8 weeks, 18% at 9 through 10 weeks, 9.7% at 11 through 12 weeks, 6.2% at 13 through 15 weeks, 4.1% at 16 through 20 weeks and 1.4% at more than 21 weeks. 90.9% of these were classified as having been done by "[[curettage]]" ([[Suction-aspiration abortion|suction-aspiration]], [[dilation and curettage]], [[dilation and evacuation]]), 7.7% by "[[medical abortion|medical]]" means ([[mifepristone]]), 0.4% by "[[instillation abortion|intrauterine instillation]]" (saline or [[prostaglandin]]), and 1.0% by "other" (including [[hysterotomy abortion|hysterotomy]] and [[hysterectomy]]).&lt;ref name="cdc2003"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Strauss |first1=L.

The reasons why women have abortions are diverse and vary across the world.&lt;ref name="guttmacher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bankole98"/&gt;
[[File:AGIAbortionReasonsBarChart.png|thumb|A bar chart depicting selected data from a 1998 [[Alan Guttmacher Institute|AGI]] [[meta-study]] on the reasons women stated for having an abortion.]] Some of the most common reasons are to postpone childbearing to a more suitable time or to focus energies and resources on existing children. Others include being unable to afford a child either in terms of the direct costs of raising a child or the loss of income while caring for the child, lack of support from the father, inability to afford additional children, desire to provide schooling for existing children, disruption of one's own education, relationship problems with their partner, a perception of being too young to have a child, unemployment, and not being willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or [[incest]], among others.&lt;ref name="bankole98"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bankole |first1=Akinrinola |last2=Singh |first2=Susheela |last3=Haas |first3=Taylor |year=1998 |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2411798.html |title=Reasons Why Women Have Induced Abortions: Evidence from 27 Countries |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=117–127; 152 |doi=10.2307/3038208 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117191716/http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2411798.html |archivedate=17 January 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="finer2005"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Finer |first1=L.

===Societal===
Some abortions are undergone as the result of societal pressures. These might include the preference for children of a specific sex or race,&lt;ref name="Nuremberg"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Nuremberg and the Crime of Abortion|url=http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1047&amp;context=lusol_fac_pubs|accessdate=12 July 2014|page=283|volume=42|work=U.

These factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or [[sex-selective abortion]].&lt;ref name="MissingWomen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oster |first=Emily |authorlink=Emily Oster |title=Explaining Asia's "Missing Women": A New Look at the Data – Comment |journal=Population and Development Review |date=September 2005 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=529, 535 |url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~eoster/dasgupta.pdf |accessdate=19 May 2009 |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2005.00082.x |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830045057/http://home.uchicago.edu/~eoster/dasgupta.pdf |archivedate=30 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2018}}

An American study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of [[birth control|contraception]] at the time of becoming pregnant. Inconsistent use was reported by half of those using [[condom]]s and three-quarters of those using the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]; 42% of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/3097748 |last1=Jones |first1=R.

===Maternal and fetal health===
An additional factor is risk to maternal or fetal health, which was cited as the primary reason for abortion in over a third of cases in some countries and as a significant factor in only a single-digit percentage of abortions in other countries.&lt;ref name="guttmacher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bankole98"/&gt;

In the U.S., the Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'': "ruled that the state's interest in the life of the fetus became compelling only at the point of viability, defined as the point at which the fetus can survive independently of its mother. Even after the point of viability, the state cannot favor the life of the fetus over the life or health of the pregnant woman. Under the right of privacy, physicians must be free to use their "medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother." On the same day that the Court decided Roe, it also decided Doe v. Bolton, in which the Court defined health very broadly: "The medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors—physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age—relevant to the well-being of the patient. All these factors may relate to health. This allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment."&lt;ref&gt;George J. Annas and Sherman Elias.

Public opinion shifted in America following television personality [[Sherri Finkbine]]'s discovery during her fifth month of pregnancy that she had been exposed to [[thalidomide]]. Unable to obtain a legal abortion in the United States, she traveled to Sweden. From 1962 to 1965, an outbreak of [[Rubella|German measles]] left 15,000 babies with severe birth defects. In 1967, the [[American Medical Association]] publicly supported liberalization of abortion laws. A National Opinion Research Center poll in 1965 showed 73% supported abortion when the mother's life was at risk, 57% when birth defects were present and 59% for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.{{sfn|Doan|2007|p=57}}

====Cancer====
&lt;!-- Sources here are &gt;10 years old, and should be updated with new ones --&gt;
The rate of cancer during pregnancy is 0.02–1%, and in many cases, cancer of the mother leads to consideration of abortion to protect the life of the mother, or in response to the potential damage that may occur to the fetus during treatment. This is particularly true for [[cervical cancer]], the most common type of which occurs in 1 of every 2,000–13,000 pregnancies, for which initiation of treatment "cannot co-exist with preservation of fetal life (unless [[neoadjuvant chemotherapy]] is chosen)". Very early stage cervical cancers (I and IIa) may be treated by [[radical hysterectomy]] and pelvic [[lymph node]] dissection, [[radiation therapy]], or both, while later stages are treated by radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may be used simultaneously. Treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy also involves fetal considerations, because [[lumpectomy]] is discouraged in favor of modified [[radical mastectomy]] unless late-term pregnancy allows follow-up radiation therapy to be administered after the birth.&lt;ref name=Weisz&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/384.full.pdf |format=PDF |title=Cancer in pregnancy: maternal and fetal implications |pmid=11476351 |last1=Weisz |first1=B |last2=Schiff |first2=E |last3=Lishner |first3=M |year=2001 |volume=7 |pages=384–393 |issue=4 |journal=Human Reproduction Update |doi=10.1093/humupd/7.4.384 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015195038/http://humupd.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/4/384.full.pdf |archivedate=15 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to a single chemotherapy drug is estimated to cause a 7.5–17% risk of [[teratogenic]] effects on the fetus, with higher risks for multiple drug treatments. Treatment with more than 40 [[gray (unit)|Gy]] of radiation usually causes spontaneous abortion. Exposure to much lower doses during the first trimester, especially 8 to 15 weeks of development, can cause [[intellectual disability]] or [[microcephaly]], and exposure at this or subsequent stages can cause reduced intrauterine growth and birth weight. Exposures above 0.005–0.025 Gy cause a dose-dependent reduction in [[IQ]].&lt;ref name=Weisz /&gt; It is possible to greatly reduce exposure to radiation with abdominal shielding, depending on how far the area to be irradiated is from the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mayr |first1=NA |last2=Wen |first2=BC |last3=Saw |first3=CB|title=Radiation therapy during pregnancy |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Clinics of North America |year=1998 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=301–21 |pmid=9629572 |doi=10.1016/s0889-8545(05)70006-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11237773"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fenig E, Mishaeli M, Kalish Y, Lishner M | title=Pregnancy and radiation. |journal=Cancer Treatment Reviews |year=2001 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |pmid=11237773 |doi=10.1053/ctrv.2000.0193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of birth itself may also put the mother at risk. "Vaginal delivery may result in dissemination of neoplastic cells into lymphovascular channels, haemorrhage, cervical laceration and implantation of malignant cells in the episiotomy site, while abdominal delivery may delay the initiation of non-surgical treatment."&lt;ref name="pmid19197101"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Li WW, Yau TN, Leung CW, Pong WM, Chan MY |title=Large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the uterine cervix complicating pregnancy |journal=Hong Kong Medical Journal |year=2009 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=69–72 |pmid=19197101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[history of abortion|ancient times]] abortions have been done using [[abortifacient|herbal medicines]], sharp tools, with [[physical trauma|force]], or through other [[traditional medicine|traditional methods]].&lt;ref name="Management of Abortion, Chp 1"/&gt; Induced abortion has long history, and can be traced back to civilizations as varied as China under [[Shennong]] (c. 2700 BCE), [[Ancient Egypt]] with its [[Ebers Papyrus]] (c. 1550 BCE), and the Roman Empire in the time of [[Juvenal]] (c. 200 CE).&lt;ref name="Management of Abortion, Chp 1"/&gt; There is evidence to suggest that pregnancies were terminated through a number of methods, including the administration of abortifacient herbs, the use of sharpened implements, the application of abdominal pressure, and other techniques. One of the [[History of abortion#5th century to 18th century|earliest]] known artistic representations of abortion is in a [[bas relief]] at Angkor Wat (c. 1150).

===Abortion debate===
{{Main|Abortion debate}}
Induced abortion has long been the source of considerable debate. [[Medical ethics|Ethical]], [[Morality|moral]], [[Philosophical aspects of the abortion debate|philosophical]], [[Therapeutic abortion|biological]], [[Ethics in religion|religious]] and [[Abortion law|legal]] issues surrounding abortion are related to [[value system]]s. Opinions of abortion may be about [[fetal rights]], governmental authority, and [[women's rights]].

In both public and private debate, arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral permissibility of an induced abortion, or justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Courtney| last=Farrell| title =Abortion Debate| publisher =ABDO Publishing Company| year =2010| pages =6–7| isbn =1617852643}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Medical Association]] Declaration on Therapeutic Abortion notes, "circumstances bringing the interests of a mother into conflict with the interests of her unborn child create a dilemma and raise the question as to whether or not the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/a1/ |title=WMA Declaration on Therapeutic Abortion |publisher=[[World Medical Association|WMA]] |accessdate=28 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028182953/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/a1/ |archivedate=28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion debates, especially pertaining to [[abortion law]]s, are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions. Anti-abortion groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion, including complete prohibition, most often describe themselves as "pro-life" while abortion rights groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as "pro-choice".&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the former position argues that a human fetus is a [[Personhood|human person]] with a [[right to life|right to live]], making abortion morally the same as [[murder]]. The latter position argues that a woman has certain [[reproductive rights]], especially the right to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term.

===Modern abortion law===

{{See also|History of abortion law debate}}
{{AbortionLawsMap|size=350px}}

Current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse. Religious, moral, and cultural factors continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world. The [[right to life]], the right to liberty, the right to [[security of person]], and the right to [[reproductive health]] are major issues of human rights that sometimes constitute the basis for the existence or absence of abortion laws.

In jurisdictions where abortion is legal, certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a safe, legal abortion (an abortion performed without the woman's consent is considered [[feticide]]). These requirements usually depend on the age of the fetus, often using a [[Pregnancy#Terminology|trimester]]-based system to regulate the window of legality, or as in the U.S., on a doctor's evaluation of the fetus' [[Fetal viability|viability]]. Some jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure, prescribe the distribution of information on [[prenatal development|fetal development]], or require that [[minors and abortion|parents be contacted]] if their minor daughter requests an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internationalfamilyplanningperspectives.org/pubs/MandatoryCounseling.pdf |title=The Impact of State Mandatory Counseling and Waiting Period Laws on Abortion: A Literature Review |format=PDF |publisher=[[Guttmacher Institute]] |author1=Theodore J.

Other jurisdictions ban abortion almost entirely. Many, but not all, of these allow legal abortions in a variety of circumstances. These circumstances vary based on jurisdiction, but may include whether the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest, the fetus' development is impaired, the woman's physical or mental well-being is endangered, or socioeconomic considerations make childbirth a hardship.&lt;ref name="Dev98-07" /&gt; In countries where abortion is banned entirely, such as [[Abortion in Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], medical authorities have recorded rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy as well as deaths due to doctors' fears of prosecution if they treat other gynecological emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European delegation visits Nicaragua to examine effects of abortion ban |date=26 November 2007 |publisher=[[Ipas (organization)|Ipas]] |accessdate=15 June 2009 |url=http://www.ipas.org/Library/News/News_Items/European_delegation_visits_Nicaragua_to_examine_effects_of_abortion_ban.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417033829/http://www.ipas.org/Library/News/News_Items/European_delegation_visits_Nicaragua_to_examine_effects_of_abortion_ban.aspx |archivedate=17 April 2008 |quote=More than 82 maternal deaths had been registered in Nicaragua since the change.

===Sex-selective abortion===
{{Main|Sex-selective abortion}}

[[Medical ultrasonography|Sonography]] and [[amniocentesis]] allow parents to determine sex before childbirth. The development of this technology has led to [[sex-selective abortion and female infanticide|sex-selective abortion]], or the termination of a fetus based on sex. The selective termination of a female fetus is most common.

Sex-selective abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in Taiwan, South Korea, India, and China.&lt;ref&gt;Banister, Judith.

===Anti-abortion violence===
{{Main|Anti-abortion violence}}
In a number of cases, abortion providers and these facilities have been subjected to various forms of violence, including murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, stalking, assault, arson, and bombing. Anti-abortion violence is classified by both governmental and scholarly sources as terrorism.&lt;ref name="csis"&gt;{{cite web |author=Smith, G.

In the United States, four physicians who performed abortions have been murdered: [[David Gunn (doctor)|David Gunn]] (1993), [[John Britton (doctor)|John Britton]] (1994), [[Barnett Slepian]] (1998), and [[George Tiller]] (2009). Also murdered, in the U.S. and Australia, have been other personnel at abortion clinics, including receptionists and security guards such as James Barrett, Shannon Lowney, Lee Ann Nichols, and Robert Sanderson. Woundings (e.g., [[Garson Romalis]]) and attempted murders have also taken place in the United States and Canada. Hundreds of bombings, arsons, acid attacks, invasions, and incidents of vandalism against abortion providers have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Death of Dr. Gunn |newspaper=New York Times |date=12 March 1993 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/opinion/the-death-of-dr-gunn.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110071743/http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/12/opinion/the-death-of-dr-gunn.html |archivedate=10 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="naf"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[National Abortion Federation]] |year=2009 |url=http://www.prochoice.org/pubs_research/publications/downloads/about_abortion/violence_stats.pdf |format=PDF |title=Incidence of Violence &amp; Disruption Against Abortion Providers in the U.S. &amp; Canada |accessdate=9 February 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613042214/http://prochoice.org/pubs_research/publications/downloads/about_abortion/violence_stats.pdf |archivedate=13 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable perpetrators of anti-abortion violence include [[Eric Robert Rudolph]], [[Scott Roeder]], [[Shelley Shannon]], and [[Paul Jennings Hill]], the first person to be executed in the United States for murdering an abortion provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/feb/03/features11.g26 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 February 1999 |title=The bomber under siege |first=Julian |last=Borger |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222105914/https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/feb/03/features11.g26 |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Legal protection of access to abortion]] has been brought into some countries where abortion is legal. These laws typically seek to protect abortion clinics from obstruction, vandalism, picketing, and other actions, or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment.

Far more common than physical violence is psychological pressure. In 2003, [[Chris Danze]] organized pro-life organizations throughout Texas to prevent the construction of a [[Planned Parenthood]] facility in Austin. The organizations [[doxing|released the personal information]] online, of those involved with construction, sending them up to 1200 phone calls a day and contacting their churches.&lt;ref name=Doan&gt;{{cite book|title=Opposition and Intimidation:The abortion wars and strategies of political harassment|author=Alesha E.

{{Marketing}}

'''Advertising''' is a [[marketing]] communication that employs an openly sponsored, non-personal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea.&lt;ref name="Stanton"&gt;William J. Stanton. ''Fundamentals of Marketing''. McGraw-Hill (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|465}} Sponsors of advertising are typically businesses wishing to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser pays for and has control over the message. It differs from personal selling in that the message is non-personal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual.&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt;{{rp|661,672}}
Advertising is communicated through various mass media,&lt;ref name="Bovee"&gt;Courtland L. Bovee, William F. Arens. Contemporary Advertising, Fourth Edition. Richard D. Irwin, Inc., 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[old media|traditional media]] such as newspapers, magazines, [[television advertisement|television]], [[radio advertisement|radio]], [[outdoor advertising]] or [[direct mail]]; and [[new media]] such as [[Online advertising#Search ads|search results]], blogs, social media, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an '''advertisement''', or "'''ad'''" or '''advert''' for short.

Commercial ads often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through "[[brand]]ing", which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. On the other hand, ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as [[direct response advertising|direct-response advertising]]. [[Non-commercial]] entities that advertise more than consumer products or services include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations and governmental agencies. Non-profit organizations may use free modes of [[persuasion]], such as a [[public service announcement]]. Advertising may also help to  reassure employees or shareholders that a company is viable or successful.

Modern advertising originated with the techniques introduced with [[tobacco advertising]] in the 1920s, most significantly with the campaigns of [[Edward Bernays]], considered the founder of modern, "[[Madison Avenue]]" advertising.&lt;ref name="Studlar2002p55"&gt;Donley T.

The man who is sometimes considered the founder of modern advertising and Madison Avenue, Edward Bernays, created many of the major cigarette campaigns of the 1920s, including having women march down the street demanding the right to smoke."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gifford2010p15"&gt;Donald G.

{{Main|History of advertising}}

[[File:Bronze printing plate for an advertisement.jpg|thumb|Bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the Liu family needle shop at [[Jinan]], [[Song dynasty]] China. It is the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.]]

Egyptians used [[papyrus]] to make sales messages and wall posters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behal|first=Vikas|last2=Sareen|first2=Sania|year=2014|title=GUERILLA MARKETING: A LOW COST MARKETING STRATEGY|url=|journal=International Journal of Management Research and Business Strategy|volume=3|pages=|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Advertising campaign|Commercial messages]] and political campaign displays have been found in the ruins of [[Pompeii]] and ancient [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. [[Lost and found]] advertising on papyrus was common in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]]. Wall or rock painting for commercial advertising is another manifestation of an ancient advertising form, which is present to this day in many parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. The tradition of wall painting can be traced back to Indian [[rock art]] paintings that date back to 4000 BC.&lt;ref name= Bhatia&gt;Bhatia (2000). ''Advertising in Rural India: Language, Marketing Communication, and Consumerism'', 62+68&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient China, the earliest advertising known was oral, as recorded in the [[Classic of Poetry]] (11th to 7th centuries BC) of bamboo flutes played to sell confectionery. Advertisement usually takes in the form of calligraphic signboards and inked papers. A copper printing plate dated back to the [[Song dynasty]] used to print posters in the form of a square sheet of paper with a rabbit logo with "[[Jinan]] Liu's Fine Needle Shop" and "We buy high-quality steel rods and make fine-quality needles, to be ready for use at home in no time" written above and below&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/chinaciv/graph/tcommain.htm|title=Commercial Advertising in China|accessdate=August 31, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008012808/http://depts.washington.edu/chinaciv/graph/tcommain.htm|archivedate=October 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered the world's earliest identified printed advertising medium.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Liu, ''Chinese Business: Landscapes and Strategies'' (2013), p.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, as the towns and cities of the Middle Ages began to grow, and the general population was unable to read, instead of signs that read "cobbler", "miller", "tailor", or "blacksmith", images associated with their trade would be used such as a boot, a suit, a hat, a clock, a diamond, a horseshoe, a candle or even a bag of flour. Fruits and vegetables were sold in the city square from the backs of carts and wagons and their proprietors used street callers ([[town crier]]s) to announce their whereabouts. The first compilation of such advertisements was gathered in "Les Crieries de Paris", a thirteenth-century poem by Guillaume de la Villeneuve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/carlin/www/docs.villeneuve.htm|title= Les Crieries de Paris|accessdate= July 9, 2015|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150608094418/https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/carlin/www/docs.villeneuve.htm|archivedate= June 8, 2015|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century advertisements started to appear in weekly newspapers in England. These early print advertisements were used mainly to promote books and newspapers, which became increasingly affordable with advances in the printing press; and medicines, which were increasingly sought after. However, [[false advertising]] and so-called "[[Quackery|quack]]" advertisements became a problem, which ushered in the regulation of advertising content.

=== 19th century ===

[[File:Edo period advertising in Japan.jpg|thumb|[[Edo period]] LEL flyer from 1806 for a traditional medicine called ''Kinseitan'']]
[[Thomas J. Barratt]] of London has been called "the father of modern advertising".&lt;ref&gt;He was first described as such in T F G Coates, 'Mr Thomas J Barratt, "The father of modern advertising"', Modern Business, September 1908, pp. 107–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mat"&gt;Matt Haig, ''Brand failures: the truth about the 100 biggest branding mistakes of all time'', Kogan Page Publishers, 2005, pp. 219, 266.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nick"&gt;Nicholas Mirzoeff, ''The visual culture reader'', Routledge, 2002, p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt; Working for the [[Pears Soap]] company, Barratt created an effective advertising campaign for the company products, which involved the use of targeted slogans, images and phrases. One of his slogans, "Good morning. Have you used Pears' soap?" was famous in its day and into the 20th century.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/04/27/100310554.pdf |title=Obituary, Thomas J. Barratt Dead: Chairman of the Firm of A. &amp; F. Pears an Advertising Genius|work=New York Times| page= 11 |publisher=New York Times |date=1914-04-27 |accessdate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="part"&gt;Eric Partridge, Paul Beale, ''A Dictionary of Catch Phrases: British and American, from the Sixteenth Century to the Present Day'', Routledge, 1986, p.164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barratt introduced many of the crucial ideas that lie behind successful advertising and these were widely circulated in his day. He constantly stressed the importance of a strong and exclusive brand image for Pears and of emphasizing the product's availability through saturation campaigns. He also understood the importance of constantly reevaluating the market for changing tastes and mores, stating in 1907 that "tastes change, fashions change, and the advertiser has to change with them. An idea that was effective a generation ago would fall flat, stale, and unprofitable if presented to the public today. Not that the idea of today is always better than the older idea, but it is different – it hits the present taste."&lt;ref name="mat" /&gt;

As the economy expanded across the world during the 19th century, advertising grew alongside. In the United States, the success of this advertising format eventually led to the growth of mail-order advertising.

In June 1836, French newspaper ''[[La Presse (France)|La Presse]]'' was the first to include paid advertising in its pages, allowing it to lower its price, extend its readership and increase its [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] and the formula was soon copied by all titles. Around 1840, [[Volney B. Palmer]] established the roots of the modern day advertising agency in Philadelphia. In 1842 Palmer bought large amounts of space in various newspapers at a discounted rate then resold the space at higher rates to advertisers. The actual ad – the copy, layout, and artwork – was still prepared by the company wishing to advertise; in effect, Palmer was a space broker. The situation changed when the first full-service advertising agency of N.W. Ayer &amp; Son was founded in 1869 in Philadelphia. Ayer &amp; Son offered to plan, create, and execute complete advertising campaigns for its customers. By 1900 the advertising agency had become the focal point of creative planning, and advertising was firmly established as a profession.

At first, agencies were brokers for advertisement space in newspapers.&lt;!-- INSERT ADVERTISING AGENCIES' ROLES AFTER THEY OUTGREW BEING LIMITED TO BEING BROKERS for ADVERTISEMENT SPACE IN NEWSPAPERS --&gt;&lt;ref name="eskilson-pg58" /&gt;

Advertising increased dramatically in the United States as industrialization expanded the supply of manufactured products.  In 1919 it was 2.5 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in the US, and it averaged 2.2 percent of GDP between then and at least 2007, though it may have declined dramatically since the [[Great Recession]].

Industry could not benefit from its increased productivity without a substantial increase in consumer spending.  This contributed to the development of mass marketing designed to influence the population's economic behavior on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, ''Captains of Consciousness'' (1976), p. 33. "As Ford's massive assembly line utilized 'extensive single-purpose machinery' to produce automobiles inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods, the costly machinery of advertising that Coolidge had described set out to produce consumers, likewise inexpensively and at a rate that dwarfed traditional methods."&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1910s and 1920s, advertisers in the U.S. adopted the doctrine that human instincts could be targeted and harnessed – "[[sublimation (psychology)|sublimated]]" into the desire to purchase commodities.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, ''Captains of Consciousness'' (1976), p. 34. "While agreeing that 'human nature is more difficult to control than material nature,' ad men spoke in specific terms of 'human instincts' which if properly understood could induce people 'to buy a given product if it was scientifically presented. If advertising copy appealed to the right instincts, the urge to buy would surely be excited'."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Bernays]], a nephew of [[Sigmund Freud]], became associated with the method and is sometimes called the founder of modern advertising and public relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DiMaggio|first=Anthony|title=The Rise of the Tea Party: Political Discontent and Corporate Media in the Age of Obama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfzFF5TT0tUC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2012|publisher=NYU Press|page=12|isbn=978-1-58367-306-5|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429145930/https://books.google.com/books?id=jfzFF5TT0tUC&amp;pg=PA12|archivedate=April 29, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernays claimed that:&lt;blockquote&gt;"[The] general principle, that men are very largely actuated by motives which they conceal from themselves, is as true of mass as of individual psychology. It is evident that the successful propagandist must understand the true motives and not be content to accept the reasons which men give for what they do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Propaganda|last=Bernays|first=Edward|publisher=|year=1928|isbn=|location=|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In other words, selling products by appealing to the rational minds of customers (the main method used prior to Bernays) was much less effective than selling products based on the unconscious desires that Bernays felt were the true motivators of human action. "Sex sells" [[Sex in advertising|became a controversial issue,]] with techniques for titillating and enlarging the audience posing a challenge to conventional morality.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger Streitmatter, ''Sex sells!: The media's journey from repression to obsession'' (Basic Books, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Dawn Blair, et al., "Ethics in advertising: sex sells, but should it?." ''Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues'' 9.1/2 (2006): 109+.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, under [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[Herbert Hoover]], the American government promoted advertising. Hoover himself delivered an address to the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World in 1925 called 'Advertising Is a Vital Force in Our National Life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|page=375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=375|isbn=978-0-307-76114-9|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506134502/https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=375|archivedate=May 6, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1929, the head of the U.S. [[Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce]], Julius Klein, stated "Advertising is the key to world prosperity."&lt;ref name="Leach367"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|page=367|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=367|isbn=978-0-307-76114-9|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502152642/https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=367|archivedate=May 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of the "unparalleled" collaboration between business and government in the 1920s, according to a 1933 European economic journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|page=373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=373|isbn=978-0-307-76114-9|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617042943/https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=373|archivedate=June 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tobacco companies became major advertisers in order to sell packaged cigarettes.&lt;ref name="Brandt2009p31"&gt;Brandt (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=yybaN6j4IpEC&amp;pg=PA31 p.31] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509171427/https://books.google.com/books?id=yybaN6j4IpEC&amp;pg=PA31 |date=May 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tobacco companies pioneered the new advertising techniques when they hired Bernays to create positive associations with tobacco smoking.&lt;ref name="Studlar2002p55" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gifford2010p15" /&gt;

Advertising was also used as a vehicle for [[cultural assimilation]], encouraging workers to exchange their traditional habits and community structure in favor of a shared "modern" lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, ''Captains of Consciousness'' (1976), pp. 68–59. "Widespread within the socially oriented literature of business in the twenties and thirties is a notion of educating people into an acceptance of the products and aesthetics of a mass-produced culture.&amp;nbsp;... Beyond this, and perhaps more important to the consciousness of many, were the indigenous networks of social structure which generated mistrust or open opposition to corporate monopolization of culture."&lt;/ref&gt; An important tool for influencing immigrant workers was the [[American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers]] (AAFLN). The AAFLN was primarily an advertising agency but also gained heavily centralized control over much of the immigrant press.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen, ''Captains of Consciousness'' (1976), pp. 62–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petit, ''The Men and Women We Want'' (2010), pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=sTubHqECr84C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 66] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415132341/http://books.google.com/books?id=sTubHqECr84C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA66 |date=April 15, 2015 }}–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1916-skin-touch-soap-ad.jpg|thumb|1916 ''Ladies' Home Journal'' version of the famous ad by [[Helen Lansdowne Resor]] of the J. Walter Thompson Agency]]

At the turn of the 20th century, advertising was one of the few career choices for women. Since women were responsible for most household purchasing done, advertisers and agencies recognized the value of women's insight during the creative process. In fact, the first American advertising to use a [[Sex in advertising|sexual sell]] was created by a woman – for a soap product. Although tame by today's standards, the advertisement featured a couple with the message "A skin you love to touch".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvacres.com/adslogans_w.htm Advertising Slogans] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120530044539/http://www.tvacres.com/adslogans_w.htm |date=May 30, 2012 }}, [[Woodbury Soap Company]], "A skin you love to touch", [[J. Walter Thompson]] Co., 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s psychologists Walter D. Scott and [[John B. Watson]] contributed applied psychological theory to the field of advertising. Scott said, "Man has been called the reasoning animal but he could with greater truthfulness be called the creature of suggestion. He is reasonable, but he is to a greater extent suggestible".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, L.T., &amp; Baker, D.B. 2004. Industrial-organizational psychology: The new psychology and the business of advertising. ''From Séance to Science: A History of the Profession of Psychology in America''. 118–121. California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; He demonstrated this through his advertising technique of a direct command to the consumer.

==== On the radio from the 1920s ====

[[File:1930.05.06 Advertisement for Radio Broadcast With Lisa Roma.gif|thumb|Advertisement for a live radio broadcast, sponsored by a milk company, Adohr milk, and published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on May 6, 1930]]

In the early 1920s, the first radio stations were established by radio equipment manufacturers, followed by [[non-profit organization]]s such as schools, clubs and civic groups who also set up their own stations.&lt;ref name="uouynv"&gt;[[Robert W. McChesney|McChesney, Robert]], ''Educators and the Battle for Control of U.S. Broadcasting, 1928–35'', Rich Media, Poor Democracy, {{ISBN|0-252-02448-6}} (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Retailer and consumer goods manufacturers quickly recognised radio's potential to reach consumers in their home and soon adopted advertising techniques that would allow their messages to stand out; [[slogan]]s, [[mascot]]s, and [[jingle]]s began to appear on [[radio]] in the 1920s and early [[television]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, F., ''Historical Dictionary of American Radio,'' Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998  pp 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of mass media communications allowed manufacturers of branded goods to bypass retailers by advertising directly to consumers. This was a major paradigm shift which forced manufacturers to focus on the brand and stimulated the need for superior insights into consumer purchasing, consumption and usage behaviour; their needs, wants and aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R.D., "A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing," in The Routledge Companion to Marketing History, D.G. Brian Jones &amp; Mark Tadajewski (eds), Oxon, Routledge, 2016, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest radio drama series were sponsored by soap manufacturers and the genre became known as a ''[[soap opera]].''&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, M.A., ''Soap Opera History,'' 1st ed., BDD Books; 1991, {{ISBN|0792454510}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before long, radio station owners realized they could increase advertising revenue by selling 'air-time' in small time allocations which could be sold to multiple businesses. By the 1930s, these ''advertising spots,'' as the packets of time became known, were being sold by the station's geographical sales representatives, ushering in an era of national radio advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, F., ''Historical Dictionary of American Radio,'' Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1940s, manufacturers began to recognize the way in which consumers were developing personal relationships with their brands in a social/psychological/anthropological sense.&lt;ref&gt;Mildred Pierce, [http://newmediagroup.co.uk/pphistory1.htm Newmediagroup.co.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206032132/http://newmediagroup.co.uk/pphistory1.htm |date=December 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers began to use motivational research and [[marketing research|consumer research]] to gather insights into consumer purchasing. Strong branded campaigns for  Chrysler and Exxon/Esso, using insights drawn research methods from psychology and cultural anthropology, led to some of most enduring campaigns of the 20th-century.&lt;ref&gt;Karmasin, H., "Ernest Dichter’s Studies on Automobile Marketing," in Schwarzkopf, S. and Gries, R.

==== Commercial television in the 1950s ====

In the early 1950s, the [[DuMont Television Network]] began the modern practice of selling advertisement time to multiple sponsors. Previously, DuMont had trouble finding sponsors for many of their programs and compensated by selling smaller blocks of advertising time to several businesses. This eventually became the standard for the commercial television industry in the United States. However, it was still a common practice to have single sponsor shows, such as [[The United States Steel Hour]]. In some instances the sponsors exercised great control over the content of the show – up to and including having one's advertising agency actually writing the show.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The single sponsor model is much less prevalent now, a notable exception being the [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==== Cable television from the 1980s ====

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of cable television and particularly [[MTV]]. Pioneering the concept of the music video, MTV ushered in a new type of advertising: the consumer tunes in ''for'' the advertising message, rather than it being a [[by-product]] or afterthought. As cable and satellite television became increasingly prevalent, [[specialty channel]]s emerged, including channels entirely [[Shopping channel|devoted to advertising]], such as [[QVC]], [[Home Shopping Network]], and [[ShopTV Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1996-11-01|title=A brief history of the future of advertising: Visions and lessons from integrated marketing communications|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296396000628|journal=Journal of Business Research|language=en|volume=37|issue=3|pages=135–138|doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(96)00062-8|issn=0148-2963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Online advertising}}

With the advent of the [[ad server]], online advertising grew, contributing to the "[[dot-com bubble|dot-com]]" boom of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senn|first1=James A.|title=Electronic Commerce Beyond the "dot com" Boom|journal=National Tax Journal|date=2000|volume=53|issue=3, Part 1|pages=373–383|doi=10.17310/ntj.2000.3.04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entire corporations operated solely on advertising revenue, offering everything from [[coupon]]s to free Internet access. At the turn of the 21st century, some websites, including the [[Web search engine|search engine]] [[Google]], changed [[online advertising]] by personalizing ads based on web browsing behavior. This has led to other similar efforts and an increase in [[interactive advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ko|first1=Hanjun|last2=Cho|first2=Chang-Hoan|last3=Roberts|first3=Marilyn S.|title=Internet Uses and Gratifications: A Structural Equation Model of Interactive Advertising|journal=Journal of Advertising|date=1 June 2005|volume=34|issue=2|pages=57–59|doi=10.1080/00913367.2005.10639191|issn=0091-3367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The share of advertising spending relative to GDP has changed little across large changes in media since 1925. In 1925, the main advertising media in America were newspapers, magazines, signs on [[Tram|streetcars]], and outdoor [[poster]]s. Advertising spending as a share of GDP was about 2.9 percent. By 1998, television and radio had become major advertising media; by 2017, the balance between broadcast and online advertising had shifted, with online spending exceeding broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fry|first=Erika|date=February 1, 2018|title=Super Bowl Ads Can't Save TV|url=&lt;!--print edition; url not determined--&gt;|journal=Fortune|type=mailed print edition|pages=pg. 12|issn=0015-8259|quote=Last year, for the first time, global ad spending on digital platforms exceeded the dolloars spent on TV - by a solid $31 billion margin.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, advertising spending as a share of GDP was slightly lower – about 2.4 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm |title=Annual U.S. Advertising Expenditure Since 1919 |publisher=Galbithink.org |date=September 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 20, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090401205848/http://galbithink.org/ad-spending.htm| archivedate= April 1, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guerrilla marketing]] involves unusual approaches such as staged encounters in public places, giveaways of products such as cars that are covered with brand messages, and interactive advertising where the viewer can respond to become part of the advertising message. This type of advertising is unpredictable, which causes consumers to buy the product or idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bigat|first1=Ekrem Cetin|title=Guerrilla Advertisement and Marketing|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=1 January 2012|volume=51|pages=1022–1029|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.08.281}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects an increasing trend of interactive and "embedded" ads, such as via [[product placement]], having consumers vote through text messages, and various campaigns utilizing [[social network service]]s such as [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Culotta|first1=Aron|last2=Cutler|first2=Jennifer|title=Mining Brand Perceptions from Twitter Social Networks|journal=Marketing Science|date=22 February 2016|volume=35|issue=3|pages=343–362|doi=10.1287/mksc.2015.0968|issn=0732-2399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the company grows and is sold, the media companies receive cash for their shares.

Domain name registrants (usually those who register and renew domains as an investment) sometimes [[domain parking|"park" their domains]] and allow advertising companies to place ads on their sites in return for per-click payments. These ads are typically driven by pay per click search engines like Google or Yahoo, but ads can sometimes be placed directly on targeted domain names through a domain lease or by making contact with the registrant of a domain name that describes a product. Domain name registrants are generally easy to identify through [[WHOIS]] records that are publicly available at registrar websites.&lt;ref name=icannwhois&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whois.icann.org/ |title=ICANN Whois Database |publisher=ICANN.org |date= |accessdate=December 15, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220121557/http://whois.icann.org/ |archivedate=December 20, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising may be categorized in a variety of ways, including by style, target audience, geographic scope, medium, or purpose.&lt;ref name="Bovee" /&gt;{{rp|9–15}} For example, in print advertising, classification by style can include display advertising (ads with design elements sold by size) vs. classified advertising (ads without design elements sold by the word or line). Advertising may be local, national or global. An ad campaign may be directed toward consumers or to businesses. The purpose of an ad may be to raise awareness (brand advertising), or to elicit an immediate sale (direct response advertising). The term '''above the line''' is used for advertising involving mass media; other types of advertising and promotion are referred to as '''below the line'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-belowtheline-advertising-10099.html|title=Examples of Below-the-Line Advertising|last=|first=|date=|work=Houston Chronicle|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "infomercial" is a [[portmanteau]] of the words "information" and "commercial". The main objective in an infomercial is to create an [[impulse purchase]], so that the target sees the presentation and then immediately buys the product through the advertised [[toll-free telephone number]] or website. Infomercials describe, display, and often demonstrate products and their features, and commonly have testimonials from customers and [[advertising professional|industry professionals]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

;Radio: [[Radio]] advertisements are broadcast as radio waves to the air from a transmitter to an antenna and a thus to a receiving device. Airtime is purchased from a station or network in exchange for airing the commercials. While radio has the limitation of being restricted to sound, proponents of radio advertising often cite this as an advantage. Radio is an expanding medium that can be found on air, and also online. According to [[Arbitron]], radio has approximately 241.6 million weekly listeners, or more than 93 percent of the U.S. population.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

;Online: Online advertising is a form of [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] that uses the Internet and [[World Wide Web]] for the expressed purpose of delivering marketing messages to attract customers. Online ads are delivered by an ad server. Examples of online advertising include contextual ads that appear on [[search engine results page]]s, [[banner ad]]s, in [[pay per click]] text ads, [[rich media]] ads, [[Social network advertising]], [[online classified advertising]], [[advertising network]]s and [[e-mail marketing]], including [[e-mail spam]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A newer form of online advertising is [[Native advertising|Native Ads]]; they go in a website's news feed and are supposed to improve user experience by being less intrusive. However, some people argue this practice is deceptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalmarketer.com/what-is-native-advertising/|title=What is Native Advertising?|author=|date=|work=Digital Marketer|accessdate=September 8, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104032/http://www.digitalmarketer.com/what-is-native-advertising/|archivedate=September 6, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Domain names: Domain name advertising is most commonly done through pay per click [[web search engine]]s, however, advertisers often lease space directly on domain names that generically describe their products. When an Internet user visits a website by typing a domain name directly into their web browser, this is known as "direct navigation", or "type in" web traffic. Although many Internet users search for ideas and products using search engines and mobile phones, a large number of users around the world still use the address bar. They will type a keyword into the address bar such as "geraniums" and add ".com" to the end of it. Sometimes they will do the same with ".org" or a country-code Top Level Domain (TLD such as ".co.uk" for the United Kingdom or ".ca" for Canada). When Internet users type in a generic keyword and add .com or another [[top-level domain]] (TLD) ending, it produces a targeted sales lead.&lt;ref name=targetedtraffic&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1nyTNnVSGAC&amp;lpg=PT61&amp;ots=4B2XJDofFT&amp;dq=what%20is%20targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&amp;pg=PT61#v=onepage&amp;q=targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&amp;f=false |title=Get Rich Click!: The Ultimate Guide to Making Money on the Internet |publisher=Free Press, Simon and Schuster |last=Ostrofsky |first=Marc |date=2011 |accessdate=December 15, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415132523/https://books.google.com/books?id=J1nyTNnVSGAC&amp;lpg=PT61&amp;ots=4B2XJDofFT&amp;dq=what%20is%20targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&amp;pg=PT61#v=onepage&amp;q=targeted%20domain%20name%20traffic&amp;f=false |archivedate=April 15, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Domain name advertising was originally developed by Oingo (later known as Applied Semantics), one of [[Google]]'s early acquisitions.&lt;ref name=oingo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allthingsd.com/20130422/ten-years-later-lessons-from-the-applied-semantics-google-acquisition/ |title=Ten Years Later – Lessons from the Applied Semantics Google Acquisition |publisher=Allthingsd.com |last=Elbaz |first=Eytan |date=April 22, 2013 |accessdate=December 15, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214035929/http://allthingsd.com/20130422/ten-years-later-lessons-from-the-applied-semantics-google-acquisition/ |archivedate=December 14, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Product placements: '''{{vanchor|Covert advertising}}''' is when a product or brand is embedded in entertainment and media. For example, in a film, the main character can use an item or other of a definite brand, as in the movie ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', where [[Tom Cruise]]'s character John Anderton owns a phone with the ''[[Nokia]]'' logo clearly written in the top corner, or his watch engraved with the ''[[Bulgari]]'' logo. Another example of advertising in film is in ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', where main character played by [[Will Smith]] mentions his ''[[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]]'' shoes several times, calling them "classics", because the film is set far in the future. ''I, Robot'' and ''[[Spaceballs]]'' also showcase futuristic cars with the ''[[Audi]]'' and ''[[Mercedes-Benz]]'' logos clearly displayed on the front of the vehicles. [[Cadillac]] chose to advertise in the movie ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'', which as a result contained many scenes in which Cadillac cars were used. Similarly, product placement for [[Omega SA|Omega Watches]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[VAIO]], [[BMW]] and [[Aston Martin]] cars are featured in recent [[James Bond]] films, most notably ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. In "[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]", the main transport vehicle shows a large [[Dodge]] logo on the front. ''[[Blade Runner]]'' includes some of the most obvious product placement; the whole film stops to show a [[Coca-Cola]] billboard.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

;Print: Print advertising describes advertising in a printed medium such as a newspaper, magazine, or trade journal. This encompasses everything from media with a very broad readership base, such as a major national newspaper or magazine, to more narrowly targeted media such as local newspapers and trade journals on very specialized topics. One form of print advertising is [[classified advertising]], which allows private individuals or companies to purchase a small, narrowly targeted ad paid by the word or line. Another form of print advertising is the display ad, which is generally a larger ad with design elements that typically run in an article section of a newspaper.&lt;ref name="Bovee" /&gt;{{rp|14}}

;Outdoor: [[Billboard]]s, also known as hoardings in some parts of the world, are large structures located in public places which display advertisements to passing pedestrians and motorists. Most often, they are located on main roads with a large amount of passing motor and pedestrian traffic; however, they can be placed in any location with large numbers of viewers, such as on mass transit vehicles and in stations, in shopping malls or office buildings, and in stadiums. The form known as street advertising first came to prominence in the UK by Street Advertising Services to create outdoor advertising on street furniture and pavements. Working with products such as [[Reverse Graffiti]], [[air dancer]]s and 3D pavement advertising, for getting brand messages out into public spaces.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Sheltered outdoor advertising combines outdoor with indoor advertisement by placing large mobile, structures ([[tents]]) in public places on temporary bases. The large outer advertising space aims to exert a strong pull on the observer, the product is promoted indoors, where the creative decor can intensify the impression.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Mobile billboard]]s are generally vehicle mounted [[billboard]]s or digital screens. These can be on dedicated vehicles built solely for carrying advertisements along routes preselected by clients, they can also be specially equipped cargo trucks or, in some cases, large banners strewn from planes. The billboards are often lighted; some being [[Backlight|backlit]], and others employing spotlights. Some billboard displays are static, while others change; for example, continuously or periodically rotating among a set of advertisements. Mobile displays are used for various situations in metropolitan areas throughout the world, including: target advertising, one-day and long-term campaigns, conventions, sporting events, store openings and similar promotional events, and big advertisements from smaller companies.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

;Point-of-sale: In-store advertising is any advertisement placed in a retail store. It includes placement of a product in visible locations in a store, such as at eye level, at the ends of aisles and near checkout counters (a.k.a. POP – point of purchase display), eye-catching displays promoting a specific product, and advertisements in such places as shopping carts and in-store video displays.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

;Novelties: Advertising printed on small tangible items such as coffee mugs, T-shirts, pens, bags, and such is known as [[Novelty item|novelty advertising]]. Some printers specialize in printing novelty items, which can then be distributed directly by the advertiser, or items may be distributed as part of a cross-promotion, such as ads on fast food containers. {{citation needed| date= January 2017}}

;Celebrity endorsements: Advertising in which a celebrity endorses a product or brand leverages celebrity power, fame, money, popularity to gain recognition for their products or to promote specific stores' or products. Advertisers often advertise their products, for example, when celebrities share their favorite products or wear clothes by specific brands or designers. Celebrities are often involved in advertising campaigns such as television or print adverts to advertise specific or general products. The use of celebrities to endorse a brand can have its downsides, however; one mistake by a celebrity can be detrimental to the [[public relations]] of a brand. For example, following his performance of eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, swimmer [[Michael Phelps]]' contract with [[Kellogg's]] was terminated, as Kellogg's did not want to associate with him after he was photographed smoking marijuana.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Celebrities such as [[Britney Spears]] have advertised for multiple products including Pepsi, Candies from Kohl's, Twister, NASCAR, and Toyota.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

;[[Aerial advertising|Aerial]]: Using aircraft, [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] or [[airship]]s to create or display advertising media. [[Skywriting]] is a notable example.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Increasingly, other media are overtaking many of the "traditional" media such as television, radio and newspaper because of a shift toward the usage of the Internet for news and music as well as devices like [[digital video recorders]] (DVRs) such as [[TiVo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/how-americans-get-news/|title=How Americans get their news|author=|date=March 17, 2014|work=American Press Institute|accessdate=December 14, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113113347/http://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/how-americans-get-news/|archivedate=November 13, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online advertising began with unsolicited bulk e-mail advertising known as "[[e-mail spam]]". Spam has been a problem for e-mail users since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adpushup.com/blog/the-history-of-online-advertising/|title=The History of Online Advertising|access-date=April 28, 2016|first=Ankit|last=Oberoi|website=AdPush|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425171749/http://www.adpushup.com/blog/the-history-of-online-advertising/|archivedate=April 25, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As new online communication channels became available, advertising followed. The first banner ad appeared on the World Wide Web in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2013/08/09/first-banner-ad|website=Mashable|title=This is the World's First Banner Ad|first=Todd|last=Wasserman|access-date=April 28, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421022220/http://mashable.com/2013/08/09/first-banner-ad/|archivedate=April 21, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prices of Web-based advertising space are dependent on the "relevance" of the surrounding web content and the traffic that the website receives.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In online display advertising, display ads generate awareness quickly. Unlike search, which requires someone to be aware of a need, display advertising can drive awareness of something new and without previous knowledge. Display works well for direct response. Display is not only used for generating awareness, it's used for direct response campaigns that link to a landing page with a clear 'call to action'.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

As the mobile phone became a new mass medium in 1998 when the first paid downloadable content appeared on mobile phones in Finland,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Brief History of Science with Levity|last=Bennet|first=Mike|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=978 1784622954|location=|pages=301|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[mobile advertising]] followed, also first launched in Finland in 2000.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} By 2007 the value of mobile advertising had reached $2 billion and providers such as [[Admob]] delivered billions of mobile ads.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

More advanced mobile ads include banner ads, coupons, [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] picture and video messages, advergames and various [[engagement marketing]] campaigns. A particular feature driving mobile ads is the [[2D barcode]], which replaces the need to do any typing of web addresses, and uses the camera feature of modern phones to gain immediate access to web content. 83 percent of Japanese mobile phone users already are active users of 2D barcodes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Some companies have proposed placing messages or corporate logos on the side of booster [[rocket]]s and the [[International Space Station]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Unpaid advertising (also called "publicity advertising"), can include personal recommendations ("bring a friend", "sell it"), spreading buzz, or achieving the feat of equating a brand with a common noun (in the United States, "[[Xerox]]" = "[[photocopier]]", "[[Kleenex]]" = [[Facial tissue|tissue]], "[[Vaseline]]" = [[petroleum jelly]], "[[The Hoover Company|Hoover]]" = [[vacuum cleaner]], and "[[Band-Aid]]" = [[adhesive bandage]]). However, some companies{{which|date=December 2014}} oppose the use of their brand name to label an object. Equating a brand with a common noun also risks turning that brand into a [[generic trademark]] – turning it into a generic term which means that its legal protection as a trademark is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Harvard Law School|title=Overview of Trademark Law|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tm.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115150952/http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tm.htm|archivedate=January 15, 2010|df=mdy-all}} "Under some circumstances, terms that are not originally generic can become generic over time (a process called "genericity"), and thus become unprotected."&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Disputed inline|date=January 2017}}

From time to time, [[The CW Television Network]] airs short programming breaks called "Content Wraps", to advertise one company's product during an entire commercial break. The CW pioneered "content wraps" and some products featured were [[Herbal Essences]], [[Crest (toothpaste)|Crest]], [[Guitar Hero II]], [[CoverGirl]], and recently [[Toyota]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A new promotion concept has appeared, "ARvertising", advertising on [[augmented reality]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pepsi's bus stop ad in London might be the best use of augmented reality yet|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/25/5545842/pepsi-bus-stop-ad-augmented-reality|work=Blippar|publisher=The Verge, Jacob Kastrenakes|accessdate=March 25, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325205500/http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/25/5545842/pepsi-bus-stop-ad-augmented-reality|archivedate=March 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy exists on the effectiveness of [[subliminal message|subliminal advertising]] (see [[mind control]]), and the pervasiveness of mass messages ([[propaganda]]).

=== Rise in new media ===

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

With the Internet came many new advertising opportunities. Pop-up, [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], banner, pop-under, [[advergaming]], and email advertisements (all of which are often unwanted or spam in the case of email) are now commonplace. Particularly since the rise of "entertaining" advertising, some people may like an advertisement enough to wish to watch it later or show a friend.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} In general, the advertising community has not yet made this easy, although some have used the Internet to widely distribute their ads to anyone willing to see or hear them. In the last three quarters of 2009, mobile and Internet advertising grew by 18% and 9% respectively, while older media advertising saw declines: −10.1% (TV), −11.7% (radio), −14.8% (magazines) and −18.7% (newspapers).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Between 2008 and 2014, U.S. newspapers lost more than half their print advertising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwartz|first1=Jason|title=Will John Henry Save the Globe?|url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/|publisher=Boston Magazine|date=March 2014|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Niche marketing ===

Another significant trend regarding future of advertising is the growing importance of the [[niche market]] using niche or targeted ads. Also brought about by the Internet and the theory of the [[long tail]], advertisers will have an increasing ability to reach specific audiences. In the past, the most efficient way to deliver a message was to blanket the largest [[mass market]] audience possible.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} However, usage tracking, customer profiles and the growing popularity of niche content brought about by everything from blogs to social networking sites, provide advertisers with audiences that are smaller but much better defined,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} leading to ads that are more relevant to viewers and more effective for companies' marketing products. Among others, [[Comcast Spotlight]] is one such advertiser employing this method in their [[video on demand]] menus. These advertisements are targeted to a specific group and can be viewed by anyone wishing to find out more about a particular business or practice, from their home. This causes the viewer to become proactive and actually choose what advertisements they want to view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comcastspotlight.com/sites/Default.aspx?pageid=7608&amp;siteid=62&amp;subnav=3 "Interactive – VOD"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326200208/http://www.comcastspotlight.com/sites/Default.aspx?pageid=7608&amp;siteid=62&amp;subnav=3 |date=March 26, 2009 }} "Comcast Spotlight website". Retrieved October 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
Niche marketing could also be helped by bringing the issue of colour into advertisements. Different colours play major roles when it comes to marketing strategies, for example, seeing the blue can promote a sense of calmness and gives a sense of security which is why many social networks such as Facebook use blue in their logos.   
[[Google AdSense]] is an example of niche marketing. Google calculates the primary purpose of a website and adjusts ads accordingly; it uses keywords on the page (or even in emails) to find the general ideas of topics disused and places ads that will most likely be clicked on by viewers of the email account or website visitors.

=== Crowdsourcing ===
{{Main|Crowdsourcing}}

The concept of crowdsourcing has given way to the trend of [[user-generated]] advertisements. User-generated ads are created by people, as opposed to an advertising agency or the company themselves, often resulting from brand sponsored advertising competitions. For the 2007 Super Bowl, the Frito-Lays division of [[PepsiCo]] held the "Crash the Super Bowl" contest, allowing people to create their own [[Doritos]] commercials.&lt;ref name="Advertising Age"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://adage.com/SuperBowlBuyers/ |title=Who's Buying What at Super Bowl 2007 |publisher=Advertising Age |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218070122/http://adage.com/SuperBowlBuyers/ |archivedate=February 18, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chevrolet]] held a similar competition for their Tahoe line of SUVs.&lt;ref name="Advertising Age" /&gt; Due to the success of the Doritos user-generated ads in the 2007 Super Bowl, Frito-Lays relaunched the competition for the 2009 and 2010 Super Bowl. The resulting ads were among the most-watched and most-liked Super Bowl ads. In fact, the winning ad that aired in the 2009 Super Bowl was ranked by the [[USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter]] as the top ad for the year while the winning ads that aired in the 2010 Super Bowl were found by Nielsen's BuzzMetrics to be the "most buzzed-about".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/business/media/09adco.html |title=Do-It-Yourself Super Ads |publisher=New York Times |date=February 8, 2010 |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |first=Stuart |last=Elliott |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217050431/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/09/business/media/09adco.html |archivedate=February 17, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2009admeter.htm |title='Two nobodies from nowhere' craft winning Super Bowl ad |publisher=USA Today |date=December 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2010 |first=Bruce |last=Horovitz |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227030845/http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/admeter/2009admeter.htm |archivedate=December 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of companies using crowdsourcing successfully is the beverage company [[Jones Soda]] that encourages consumers to participate in the label design themselves.

This trend has given rise to several online platforms that host user-generated advertising competitions on behalf of a company. Founded in 2007, [[Zooppa]] has launched ad competitions for brands such as Google, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[The Hershey Company|Hershey's]], [[General Mills]], [[Microsoft]], [[NBC Universal]], Zinio, and [[Mini Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=34241909|title=Zooppa.com, Inc.: Private Company Information - Bloomberg|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2017-04-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019210743/https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=34241909|archivedate=October 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowdsourced remains controversial, as the long-term impact on the advertising industry is still unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/9521.asp |title=Are Consumer-Generated Ads Here to Stay? |publisher=iMediaConnection |date=May 10, 2006 |accessdate=May 10, 2010|first=Robert|last=Moskowitz| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100426103023/http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/9521.asp| archivedate= April 26, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global advertising ===
{{Main|Global marketing}}

Advertising has gone through five major stages of development: domestic, export, international, multi-national, and global. For [[Global marketing|global advertisers]], there are four, potentially competing, business objectives that must be balanced when developing worldwide advertising: building a brand while speaking with one voice, developing [[economies of scale]] in the creative process, maximising local effectiveness of ads, and increasing the company's speed of implementation. Born from the evolutionary stages of global marketing are the three primary and fundamentally different approaches to the development of global advertising executions: exporting executions, producing local executions, and importing ideas that travel.&lt;ref&gt;Global marketing Management, 2004, pp. 13–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising research is key to determining the success of an ad in any country or region. The ability to identify which elements and/or moments of an ad contribute to its success is how [[economies of scale]] are maximized. Once one knows what works in an ad, that idea or ideas can be imported by any other market. [[Market research]] measures, such as [[Wikt:flow of attention|Flow of Attention]], [[Wikt:flow of emotion|Flow of Emotion]] and [[Wikt:branding moment|branding moments]] provide insight into what is working in an ad in any country or region because the measures are based on the visual, not verbal, elements of the ad.&lt;ref&gt;Young, p.131&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign public messaging ===
{{See also|Soft power|International tourism advertising}}

Foreign governments,{{which|date=December 2014}} particularly those that own marketable commercial products or services, often promote their interests and positions through the advertising of those goods because the target audience is not only largely unaware of the forum as a vehicle for foreign messaging but also willing to receive the message while in a mental state of absorbing information from advertisements during television commercial breaks, while reading a periodical, or while passing by billboards in public spaces. A prime example of this messaging technique is advertising campaigns to promote international travel. While advertising foreign destinations and services may stem from the typical goal of increasing revenue by drawing more tourism, some travel campaigns carry the additional or alternative intended purpose of promoting good sentiments or improving existing ones among the target audience towards a given nation or region. It is common for advertising promoting foreign countries to be produced and distributed by the tourism ministries of those countries, so these ads often carry political statements and/or depictions of the foreign government's [[Perception management|desired international public perception]]. Additionally, a wide range of foreign airlines and travel-related services which advertise separately from the destinations, themselves, are owned by their respective governments; examples include, though are not limited to, the [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates airline]] ([[Dubai]]), [[Singapore Airlines]] (Singapore), [[Qatar Airways]] ([[Qatar]]), [[China Airlines]] ([[Taiwan]]/[[Republic of China]]), and [[Air China]] (People's Republic of China). By depicting their destinations, airlines, and other services in a favorable and pleasant light, countries market themselves to populations abroad in a manner that could mitigate prior public impressions.

=== Diversification ===

In the realm of [[advertising agencies]], continued industry diversification has seen observers note that "big global clients don't need big global agencies any more".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Howard |first=Theresa |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-10-09-goodson-profile_x.htm |title=USA Today, October 9, 2005 |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=October 10, 2005 |accessdate=April 20, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327010633/http://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/2005-10-09-goodson-profile_x.htm |archivedate=March 27, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected by the growth of non-traditional agencies in various global markets, such as Canadian business [[TAXI (advertising agency)|TAXI]] and [[SMART (advertising agency)|SMART]] in Australia and has been referred to as "a revolution in the ad world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New technology ===

The ability to record shows on [[digital video recorder]]s (such as TiVo) allow watchers to record the programs for later viewing, enabling them to fast forward through commercials. Additionally, as more seasons of pre-recorded [[box set]]s are offered for sale of television programs; fewer people watch the shows on TV. However, the fact that these sets are '''sold''', means the company will receive additional profits from these sets.

To counter this effect, a variety of strategies have been employed. Many advertisers have opted for product placement on TV shows like [[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]. Other strategies include integrating advertising with internet-connected [[EPG]]s, advertising on companion devices (like smartphones and tablets) during the show, and creating [[TV apps]]. Additionally, some like brands have opted for [[social television]] sponsorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2011/05/09/survivor-jeff-probst-says-product-placement-is-here-to-stay/|title=Reality TV|website=realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419064602/http://realitytvmagazine.sheknows.com/2011/05/09/survivor-jeff-probst-says-product-placement-is-here-to-stay/|archivedate=April 19, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emerging technology of [[drone display]]s has recently been used for advertising purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2016/11/intel-launches-500-drones-into-sky-and-breaks-world-record-in-spectacular-style-449886&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advertising education ===

In recent years there have been several media literacy initiatives, and more specifically concerning advertising, that seek to empower citizens in the face of media advertising campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Britt|last2=Schellens|first2=Tammy|last3=Valcke|first3=Martin|date=2017|title=Promoting Adolescents' Moral Advertising Literacy in Secondary Education|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=93–103|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-09|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Advertising education]] has become popular with bachelor, master and doctorate degrees becoming available in the emphasis.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A surge in advertising interest is typically attributed to the strong relationship advertising plays in cultural and technological changes, such as the advance of online social networking.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} A unique model for teaching advertising is the [[student-run advertising agency]], where advertising students create campaigns for real companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Purposes ==
Advertising is at the front of delivering the proper message to customers and prospective customers. The purpose of advertising is to inform the consumers about their product and convince customers that a company's services or products are the best, enhance the image of the company, point out and create a need for products or services, demonstrate new uses for established products, announce new products and programs, reinforce the salespeople's individual messages, draw customers to the business, and to hold existing customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = How to start and succeed in a business of your own |first=John| last=Taylor| year = 1978| page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sales promotions and brand loyalty ===
Sales promotions are another way to advertise. Sales promotions are double purposed because they are used to gather information about what type of customers one draws in and where they are, and to jump start sales. Sales promotions include things like contests and games, sweepstakes, product giveaways, samples coupons, loyalty programs, and discounts. The ultimate goal of sales promotions is to stimulate potential customers to action.&lt;ref&gt;Altstiel, Tom, and Jean Grow. Advertising Strategy: Creative Tactics From the Outside/In.

While advertising can be seen as necessary for economic growth,&lt;ref name="Leach367" /&gt; it is not without social costs. [[E-mail spam|Unsolicited commercial e-mail]] and other forms of [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] have become so prevalent as to have become a major nuisance to users of these services, as well as being a financial burden on [[internet service provider]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/03/1528247&amp;tid=111 |title=Slashdot &amp;#124; ISP Operator Barry Shein Answers Spam Questions |publisher=Interviews.slashdot.org |date=March 3, 2003 |accessdate=April 20, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813200327/http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03%2F03%2F03%2F1528247&amp;tid=111 |archivedate=August 13, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising is increasingly invading public spaces, such as schools, which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416200521/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/marketers_target_kids.cfm|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/marketers_target_kids.cfm |archivedate=April 16, 2009 |title=How Marketers Target Kids |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=January 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increasing difficulty in limiting exposure to specific audiences can result in negative backlash for advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Influence of gender stereotypes on advertising offensiveness and attitude toward advertising in general|url=|journal=International Journal of Advertising|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem with these criticisms, the advertising industry has seen low approval rates in surveys and negative cultural portrayals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew C.|last2=Dromi|first2=Shai M.|title=Advertising morality: maintaining moral worth in a stigmatized profession|journal=Theory &amp; Society|volume=47|issue=2|pages=175–206|doi=10.1007/s11186-018-9309-7|url=https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11186-018-9309-7?author_access_token=7NqWYsAc_xBowppAv-q8mve4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6AEWVv2PLqubmhfuYTCeD-V3SRQ6CfZmxJResEGYJBsoZEDraaO2K-ltnWj2TVPmZ7jDY7bNZ5z2Kbuu8SoXhAHCzJkdSEdHAdS5s0BzfR6w%3D%3D|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most controversial criticisms of advertisement in the present day is that of the predominance of advertising of foods high in sugar, fat, and salt specifically to children. Critics claim that food advertisements targeting children are exploitive and are not sufficiently balanced with proper nutritional education to help children understand the consequences of their food choices. Additionally, children may not understand that they are being sold something, and are therefore more impressionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gussow|first1=Joan|title=Counternutritional Messages of TV Ads Aimed at Children|journal=Journal of Nutrition Education|date=March 2, 1972|pages=48–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michelle Obama has criticized large food companies for advertising unhealthy foods largely towards children and has requested that food companies either limit their advertising to children or advertise foods that are more in line with dietary guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Lady to Food Companies: Make Healthier Ads for Kids Now|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/first-lady-to-food-companies-make-healthier-ads-for-kids-now/|website=CBS News|accessdate=April 20, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427111344/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/first-lady-to-food-companies-make-healthier-ads-for-kids-now/|archivedate=April 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other criticisms include the change that are brought by those advertisements on the society and also the deceiving ads that are aired and published by the corporations.

== Regulation ==

There have been increasing efforts to protect the public interest by regulating the content and the influence of advertising. Some examples include restrictions for advertising [[alcohol advertising|alcohol]], [[tobacco advertising|tobacco]] or [[gambling]] imposed in many countries, as well as the bans around [[advertising to children]], which exist in parts of Europe. Advertising regulation focuses heavily on the [[false advertising|veracity]] of the claims and as such, there are often tighter restrictions placed around advertisements for food and healthcare products.&lt;ref name="UK_advertising"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/marketing-advertising-law/overview |title=Marketing and Advertising: The Law |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |date=2016-01-15 |accessdate=2016-09-05 |author=UK_advertising |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924105931/https://www.gov.uk/marketing-advertising-law/overview |archivedate=September 24, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising industries within some countries rely less on laws and more on systems of self-regulation.&lt;ref name="UK_advertising" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asa.co.nz/ |title=Advertising Standards Authority |publisher=Advertising Standards Authority |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831014312/http://www.asa.co.nz/ |archivedate=August 31, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=asasa&gt;{{Citation|title=Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa: About Us|url=http://www.asasa.org.za/Default.aspx?mnu_id=10/|accessdate=2010-07-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202014/http://www.asasa.org.za/Default.aspx?mnu_id=10%2F|archivedate=March 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers and the media agree on a code of advertising standards that they attempt to uphold. The general aim of such codes is to ensure that any advertising is 'legal, decent, honest and truthful'. Some self-regulatory organizations are funded by the industry, but remain independent, with the intent of upholding the standards or codes like the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asa.org.uk/About-ASA/About-regulation |title=About Regulation Our Framework |publisher=ASA.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007111318/https://www.asa.org.uk/About-ASA/About-regulation |archivedate=October 7, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, most forms of [[outdoor advertising]] such as the display of billboards is regulated by the UK Town and County Planning system. Currently, the display of an advertisement without consent from the Planning Authority is a criminal offense liable to a fine of £2,500 per offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planningguidance.planningportal.gov.uk/blog/guidance/advertisments/is-consent-from-the-local-planning-authority-always-required-to-display-advertisements/ |title=What happens if an advertisement is displayed without the necessary consent? |publisher=PlanningGuidance.PlanningPortal.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-10-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006191802/http://planningguidance.planningportal.gov.uk/blog/guidance/advertisments/is-consent-from-the-local-planning-authority-always-required-to-display-advertisements/ |archivedate=October 6, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, many communities believe that many forms of outdoor advertising blight the public realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanblight.org/ |title=Welcome to SCRUB |publisher=Urbanblight.org |date= |accessdate=April 20, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090422040852/http://www.urbanblight.org/| archivedate= April 22, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long ago as the 1960s in the US there were attempts to ban billboard advertising in the open countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/beauty.htm |title=How the Highway Beautification Act Became a Law |publisher=Fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=April 20, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090604005907/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/beauty.htm| archivedate= June 4, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities such as [[São Paulo]] have introduced an outright ban&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/world/americas/12iht-brazil.html?_r=0 |title=Billboard ban in São Paulo angers advertisers – Americas – International Herald Tribune |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=January 20, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226112132/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/world/americas/12iht-brazil.html?_r=0 |archivedate=February 26, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with London also having specific legislation to control unlawful displays.

Some governments restrict the languages that can be used in advertisements, but advertisers may employ tricks to try avoiding them. In France for instance, advertisers sometimes print English words in bold and French translations in fine print to deal with Article 120 of the 1994 [[Toubon Law]] limiting the use of English.&lt;ref&gt;Bhatia and Ritchie 2006:542&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertising of pricing information is another topic of concern for governments. In the United States for instance, it is common for businesses to only mention the existence and amount of applicable taxes at a later stage of a transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dor.wa.gov/content/getaformorpublication/publicationbysubject/taxtopics/TaxIncluded.aspx |title=Advertising – Tax Included in Price |publisher=Department of Revenue, Washington State |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827174442/http://dor.wa.gov/Content/GetAFormOrPublication/PublicationBySubject/TaxTopics/TaxIncluded.aspx |archivedate=August 27, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada and New Zealand, taxes can be listed as separate items, as long as they are quoted up-front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tico.ca/industry-info/advertising-requirements.html |title=Advertising Requirements |publisher=Travel Industry Council of Ontario |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918231329/http://www.tico.ca/industry-info/advertising-requirements.html |archivedate=September 18, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.consumerprotection.govt.nz/get-guidance/shopping-and-buying/pricing/ |title=Pricing |publisher=Consumer Protection |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913213536/https://www.consumerprotection.govt.nz/get-guidance/shopping-and-buying/pricing/ |archivedate=September 13, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most other countries, the advertised price must include all applicable taxes, enabling customers to easily know how much it will cost them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.accc.gov.au/business/pricing-surcharging/displaying-prices |title=Displaying Prices |publisher=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05 |author=ACCC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913152407/http://www.accc.gov.au/business/pricing-surcharging/displaying-prices |archivedate=September 13, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/Display-Code.aspx?CodeId=%7B1BB5E9A2-C840-46CB-8211-88E7E34E61B7%7D&amp;ItemId=%7B37D44B06-C5E4-430C-A161-035555C10543%7D |title=Relevant Code Rule |publisher=Advertising Standards Authority |date= |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105203616/https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/Display-Code.aspx?CodeId=%7B1BB5E9A2-C840-46CB-8211-88E7E34E61B7%7D&amp;ItemId=%7B37D44B06-C5E4-430C-A161-035555C10543%7D |archivedate=November 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer_affairs/consumer_protection/pricing/price_display_of_goods_and_services.html |title=Display of Prices for Goods and Services |publisher=Citizens Information |date=2016-05-31 |accessdate=2016-09-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828161455/http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/consumer_affairs/consumer_protection/pricing/price_display_of_goods_and_services.html |archivedate=August 28, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing mix ===
{{Main|Marketing mix}}

The [[marketing mix]] was proposed by professor [[E. Jerome McCarthy]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing. A Managerial Approach|year=1964|publisher=Irwin|location=Homewood, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of four basic elements called the "'''four Ps'''". '''Product''' is the first P representing the actual product. '''Price''' represents the process of determining the value of a product. '''Place''' represents the variables of getting the product to the consumer such as distribution channels, market coverage and movement organization. The last P stands for '''Promotion''' which is the process of reaching the target market and convincing them to buy the product.

In the 1990s, the concept of '''four Cs''' was introduced as a more customer-driven replacement of four P's.&lt;ref name="Business for Higher Awards"&gt;{{cite book |title= Business for Higher Awards |last= Needham |first= Dave |year= 1996 |publisher=Heinemann |location=Oxford, England }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two theories based on four Cs: Lauterborn's four Cs (''consumer'', ''cost'', ''communication'', ''convenience'')

=== Advertising research ===
{{Main|Advertising research}}

Advertising research is a specialized form of research that works to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising. It entails numerous forms of research which employ different methodologies. Advertising research includes pre-testing (also known as [[copy testing]]) and post-testing of ads and/or campaigns.

Pre-testing includes a wide range of qualitative and quantitative techniques, including: focus groups, in-depth target audience interviews (one-on-one interviews), small-scale quantitative studies and physiological measurement. The goal of these investigations is to better understand how different groups respond to various messages and visual prompts, thereby providing an assessment of how well the advertisement meets its communications goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.copytesting.org|title=CopyTesting.org|website=www.copytesting.org|access-date=2017-02-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425021551/http://copytesting.org/|archivedate=April 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-testing employs many of the same techniques as pre-testing, usually with a focus on understanding the change in awareness or attitude attributable to the advertisement. With the emergence of digital advertising technologies, many firms have begun to continuously post-test ads using real-time data. This may take the form of A/B split-testing or multivariate testing.

Continuous [[ad tracking]] and the [[Communicus]] System are competing examples of post-testing advertising research types.&lt;ref&gt;Peeter Verlegh, Hilde Voorveld, and Martin Eisend, eds. ''Advances in Advertising Research (Vol. VI): The Digital, the Classic, the Subtle, and the Alternative'' (Springer, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semiotics ===
{{Main|Advertising research}}

Meanings between consumers and marketers depict [[signage|signs]] and symbols that are encoded in everyday objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mick|first=Devid Glen|title=Consumer Research and Semiotics: Exploring the Morphology of Signs, Symbols, and Significance|journal=The Journal of Consumer Research|date=September 1986|volume=13|issue=2|page=196|doi=10.1086/209060}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Semiotics]] is the study of signs and how they are interpreted. Advertising has many hidden signs and meanings within [[brand names]], [[logos]], package designs, print advertisements, and [[television advertisements]]. Semiotics aims to study and interpret the message being conveyed in (for example) advertisements. Logos and advertisements can be interpreted at two levels – known as the surface level and the underlying level. The surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for a product.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} These signs can be images, words, fonts, [[color]]s, or slogans. The underlying level is made up of hidden meanings. The combination of images, words, [[color]]s, and slogans must be interpreted by the audience or consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Beasley|first= Ron|title= Persuasive Signs: The Semiotics of Advertising|year= 2002|publisher= Walter deGruyter GmbH &amp; KG|location= Berlin, Germany|isbn= 3-11-017341-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "key to advertising analysis" is the signifier and the signified. The signifier is the object and the signified is the mental concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Pinson|first= Christian|title= Marketing Semiotics|year= 1998|url= http://flora.insead.edu/fichiersti_wp/inseadwp1998/98-39.pdf|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110816121627/http://flora.insead.edu/fichiersti_wp/inseadwp1998/98-39.pdf|archivedate= August 16, 2011|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product has a signifier and a signified. The signifier is the color, brand name, logo design, and technology. The signified has two meanings known as denotative and connotative. The denotative meaning is the meaning of the product. A television's denotative meaning might be that it is high definition. The connotative meaning is the product's deep and hidden meaning. A connotative meaning of a television would be that it is top-of-the-line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Umiker-Sebeok|first= Donna Jean|title= Marketing and Semiotics|year= 1987|publisher= Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co.|location= Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] commercials{{when|date=April 2015}} used a black [[silhouette]] of a person that was the age of Apple's target market. They placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changing. However, the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white iPod through white headphones. Through advertising, the white color on a set of earphones now signifies that the music device is an iPod. The white color signifies almost all of Apple's products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Salsburey|first= Justin|title= Semiotic analysis of iPod Advertisements|url= http://sites.google.com/site/jsalsburey/macintoshsemiotics|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130521105135/https://sites.google.com/site/jsalsburey/macintoshsemiotics|archivedate= May 21, 2013|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The semiotics of [[gender]] plays a key influence on the way in which signs are interpreted. When considering [[Gender advertisement|gender roles in advertising]], individuals are influenced by three categories. Certain characteristics of stimuli may enhance or decrease the elaboration of the message (if the product is perceived as [[feminine]] or [[masculine]]). Second, the characteristics of individuals can affect [[attention]] and elaboration of the message ([[tradition]]al or non-traditional [[gender role]] orientation). Lastly, situational factors may be important to influence the elaboration of the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ademola|first=Owolabi|title=Effects of Gender-Role Orientation, Sex of Advert Presenter and Product Type on Advertising Effectiveness|journal=European Journal of Scientific Research|year=2005|volume=35|issue=4|pages=537–543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of [[marketing communication]] claims-objective and subjective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Koc|first= Erdogan|title= Impact of gender in marketing communications: the role of cognitive and affective cues|journal= Journal of Marketing Communications|year= 2002|volume= 8|issue= 4|page= 257|doi= 10.1080/13527260210145993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objective claims stem from the extent to which the claim associates the brand with a tangible product or service feature. For instance, a camera may have auto-focus features. Subjective claims convey emotional, subjective, impressions of intangible aspects of a product or service. They are non-physical features of a product or service that cannot be directly perceived, as they have no physical reality. For instance the [[brochure]] has a beautiful design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Holbrook|first= Morris|title= Beyond Attitude Structure: Toward the Informational Determinants of Attitude|journal= Journal of Marketing Research|date= November 1978|volume= 15|issue= 4|doi= 10.2307/3150624|page= 545|jstor= 3150624}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Male]]s tend to respond better to objective marketing-communications claims while [[female]]s tend to respond better to subjective [[marketing communications]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Silverman|first= Julian|author2= King, Catherine|title= Pseudoperceptual differentiation|journal= Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|year= 1970|volume= 34|issue= 1|pages= 119–23|doi= 10.1037/h0028807|pmid= 5436459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voiceover]]s are commonly used in advertising. Most voiceovers are done by men, with figures of up to 94% having been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Female Celebrities Still Can't Break Through the Glass Ceiling of Voice-over Work|url= http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/female-celebrity-voiceovers-glass-ceiling.html|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151009060321/http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/female-celebrity-voiceovers-glass-ceiling.html|archivedate= October 9, 2015|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been more female voiceovers in recent years,{{when|date=April 2015}} but mainly for food, household products, and feminine-care products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1207/s15506878jobem4403_10|title= Gender-Differentiated Production Features in Toy Commercials|journal= Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|volume= 44|issue= 3|pages= 503|year= 2010|last1= Chandler|first1= Daniel|last2= Griffiths|first2= Merris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender effects in the processing of advertising ==

According to a 1977 study by David Statt, females process information comprehensively, while males process information through heuristic devices such as procedures, methods or strategies for solving [[problem]]s, which could have an effect on how they interpret advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Statt|first= David|title= Understanding the Consumer – A Psychological Approach|year= 1977|publisher= Macmillan Press|location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=February 2017}} According to this study, men prefer to have available and apparent cues to interpret the message, whereas females engage in more creative, associative, imagery-laced interpretation. Later research by a Danish team&lt;ref&gt;Vestergaard and Schrøder, ''The Language of Advertising'', 75&lt;/ref&gt; found that advertising attempts to persuade men to improve their appearance or performance, whereas its approach to women aims at [[transformation (disambiguation)|transformation]] toward an impossible ideal of female presentation. In Paul Suggett's article "The Objectification of Women in Advertising"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|title=Advertising Sets Impossible Standards for Women|work=The Balance|access-date=2017-05-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326082225/https://www.thebalance.com/advertising-women-and-objectification-38754|archivedate=March 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; he discusses the negative impact that these women in advertisements, who are too perfect to be real, have on women, as well as men, in real life. Advertising's manipulation of women's aspiration to these ideal types as portrayed in film, in erotic art, in advertising, on stage, within music videos, and through other media exposures requires at least a conditioned rejection of female reality, and thereby takes on a highly ideological cast. Studies show that these expectations of women and young girls negatively impact their views about their bodies and appearances. These advertisements are directed towards men. Not everyone agrees: one critic viewed this monologic, gender-specific interpretation of advertising as excessively skewed and politicized.&lt;ref&gt;Splendora, "Discourse", Review of Vestergaard and Schrøder, ''The Language of Advertising'' in ''Language in Society,'' 449&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=February 2017}} There are some companies, however, like [[Dove Beauties|Dove]] and [[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]] that are creating commercials to portray more natural women, with less [[image manipulation|post production manipulation]], so more women and young girls are able to relate to them.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} These commercials give more natural beauty standards.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

More recent research by Martin (2003) reveals that males and females differ in how they react to advertising depending on their mood at the time of exposure to the ads, and on the affective tone of the advertising. When feeling sad, males prefer happy ads to boost their mood. In contrast, females prefer happy ads when they are feeling happy. The television programs in which ads are embedded influence a viewer's mood state.&lt;ref&gt;
Martin, Brett A. S. (2003), [http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-2003.pdf "The Influence of Gender on Mood Effects in Advertising"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025120035/http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Martin-2003.pdf |date=October 25, 2012 }}, ''Psychology and Marketing'',20 (3), 249–73.
&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Wojcicki, author of the article "Ads that Empower Women don’t just Break Stereotypes—They’re also Effective"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/ads-empower-women-don-t-just-break-stereotypes-they-re-also-effective-170953/|title=Ads That Empower Women Don’t Just Break Stereotypes—They’re Also Effective|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326152331/http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/ads-empower-women-don-t-just-break-stereotypes-they-re-also-effective-170953/|archivedate=March 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses how advertising to women has changed since the first [[Barbie]] commercial where a little girl tells the doll that, she wants to be just like her. Little girls grow up watching advertisements of scantily clad women advertising things from trucks to burgers, and Wojcicki states that this shows girls that they are either arm candy or eye candy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3139">The '''Biomedical Sciences Research Center "Alexander Fleming"''' is a non-profit research organisation based in [[Vari, Athens]], [[Greece]]. The Center is named after the scientist [[Alexander Fleming]].

Since the beginning of its operations in 1998, the Center develops basic as well as translational and applied research programs at the cutting edge of modern biomedical sciences.  Currently the Center hosts 14 research groups distributed in 4 Institutes (Immunology, Molecular Oncology, Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology). Over the short period since its establishment, BSRC Al. Fleming has gained extensive visibility in the European science arena.

Fleming researchers have established transgenic animal models for rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis and these models have served as a basis for multiple collaborations with the international biopharmaceutical industry in the evaluation of novel therapeutic compounds, or as tools for collaborative R&amp;D.

The Center is equipped with state-of-the-art Core Units which include: an Expression Profiling Facility, a Flow Cytometry Facility, a Protein Chemistry Lab, a Transgenics and gene targeting Unit, and a BioIT Unit, all of which serve internal collaborations, as well as external partners in academia and industry. The Center also runs an Innovation and Enterprise Unit that facilitates the protection and exploitation of the Center’s research and technologies.

Fleming operates its own Animal House, which can house up to 20,000 mice and has its own complete mouse histopathology unit. Fleming’s Animal house (certified with ISO 9001) provides husbandry of animals and services to the biomedical research community since 2001. It covers an area of approximately 600 m2 within the Center and is equipped with highly automated systems that provide the best possible conditions for mouse reproduction and maintenance. Its main activity is the reproduction and maintenance of mice stocks either of inbred strains or genetically engineered mice, such as transgenic and knockout mouse lines, as well as chemically induced mutants developed by Fleming researchers. The Animal House has a capacity to house more than 20,000 mice and is currently the largest Mouse Unit in Greece in terms of number and variety of mice. The Facility became a full member of EMMA in 2009.

'''Main areas of research:''' Functional genomics and proteomics; Molecular and cellular immunology; Animal models of human disease; Transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene regulation; DNA repair; Stem Cell differentiation; Epigenetics; Learning and memory; ECM biology.
Fields of excellence: Molecular mechanisms of disease (inflammation, cancer, metabolic syndrome, CNS disorders)

'''Aplia Inc.''' is an [[educational technology]] company founded in 2000 by [[Stanford University]] professor [[Paul Romer]] that offers online homework products geared toward college-level courses. In March 2007 [[Cengage Learning]] (formerly Thomson Learning) acquired Aplia Inc. Aplia was based in [[Belmont, California|Belmont]], California until March 2014, when it relocated to Cengage Learning's new [[Mission Bay, San Francisco]] office.

==History==
In 1998, Romer created an online experiment system for use in his economics courses at [[Stanford University]] so his students would come to class better prepared and become more engaged with the course material. After other professors expressed interest in his approach, Romer decided to turn this system into the basis for a new company. He raised $10 million in venture capital to start Aplia, an online learning system. Since 2000, it has been used by over 4,300 professors, 1,200,000 students, at 1,300 colleges and universities worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aplia.com/company&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product==
Aplia’s basic product includes online homework assignments that professors can assign to students in accounting, business communication, business law, developmental reading, economics, finance, marketing, philosophy, statistics, and taxation. While the basic premise behind each course is the same, course materials vary; in many cases, Aplia problem sets are designed to complement specific textbook from a variety of publishers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aplia.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Aplia support representatives set up and edit courses per the professor's schedule. Assignment types include problem sets, news analyses, tutorials, and (for economics) interactive market experiments.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Aplia is often integrated with textbooks from different publishers.  Aplia's questions are written by content experts in their respective fields and the problem sets match the tone, difficulty level, style, of the textbook. Aplia works with publishers, authors, and contributors, and many users believe the quality is decent.&lt;ref&gt;http://amplicate.com/hate/aplia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/07/AR2009050704299_pf.html|title=Steven Pearlstein - An Economist, an Academic Puzzle and a Lot of Promise|website=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of pricing, many of Aplia's products have a low-cost digital textbook as well as Aplia. In the Friday, May 9 issue of ''The Washington Post'', author Steven Pearlstein writes: "Aplia also paves the way for the textbook industry to ditch a lousy business model in which it has to charge ridiculously high prices for new books because it cannot collect anything from the students who buy them on the used-book market. Instead, publishers could move to a more sustainable model in which the textbook is priced close to the cost of printing and shipping (say, $20), while all students are charged a reasonable fee (say, $60) for what really matters, which is the content of the textbook, the labs and homework exercises."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

Research has also shown Aplia to be less effective in the classroom for students who require an indepth relationship with the teacher. Studies are surfacing to find online learning to be another challenge that students must overcome in order to learn a subject they might be unfamiliar with. Some anecdotal evidence has been found that schools administration have found value in the micromanagement software features that Aplia offers, especially with keeping students on track with their assignments and increasing engagement and participation in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504850600993663|title=‘D’ is for dilly-dally?|first1=Arthur J.|last1=Caplan|first2=John|last2=Gilbert|date=21 November 2008|publisher=|journal=Applied Economics Letters|volume=15|issue=14|pages=1085–1088|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1080/13504850600993663}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aplia.com/company/press/ael_010107.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aplia features==

===Chapter assignments and problem sets===
Chapter assignments (or problem sets)--groups of questions based on each chapter of a textbook—are automatically graded and provide students with explanations for every question. All problems are randomized and written by a team of subject matter experts. Most assignments use "Grade It Now" technology. Students are given three attempts on each problem; if they don't like their score after their first attempt, they may try a second time; if they don’t like their score after two, they may try a third; they don't have to use all three attempts. Scores are averaged.

===News analyses===
In economics and finance, Aplia regularly features economics and finance articles from new sources. Each story includes a summary and follow-up questions.

===Experiments===
For economics, Aplia offers real-time, online market experiments to help students understand what the real market environment is like. Each experiment is supported by assignments that prepare students for this and help them analyze their results. These experiments have had proven success in the classroom as well—according to research, Aplia's methods provide college students with means to truly learn the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=708841|title=Conducting a Double Oral Auction Experiment in a High School Computer Lab: A Pilot Study|first=Paul R.|last=Johnson|date=1 March 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multimedia===
All of Aplia's courses use multimedia to pique students' interest. Developmental Reading, for instance, uses audio so students can hear how vocabulary words are pronounced; Logic uses interactive Venn diagrams, truth tables, and natural deduction proofs so students keep learning the material hands-on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aplia.com/developmentalreading&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aplia.com/philosophy|title=Aplia|website=www.aplia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment and grading===
Aplia keeps instructors informed about student participation, progress, and real-time graphical reports. Instructors can download, save, manipulate, print, import, and export student grades. Gradebook Analytics allow instructors to monitor and address performance on a student-by-student and topic-by-topic basis.

===Course management system===
Instructors can post announcements, upload course materials, host student discussions, e-mail students, and manage their gradebook with Aplia’s course management system. Aplia works independently or in conjunction with other course management systems.

==Aplia criticism==

===Additional course fees and registration fees===
Students are charged (per course) additional registration fees on top of their home institutions tuition or per unit fees. This may amount to more than the parent institution's total cost for the entire course when including materials fees. This has been regarded by some to be a "troubling lack of transparency regarding the total net costs associated with getting a college degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bostinno.com/channels/should-students-pay-to-submit-homework-publishers-think-so/|title=Should Students Pay to Submit Homework? Publishers Think So|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outsourcing jobs ===
In 2015 several employees were asked to gather in the main conference room where a tactic of "psychological divide and conquer" separated the employees into the first of many days and weeks of learning that not only was their job being sent overseas that they would be shadowed by their replacement whom they would train.

One employee told Computer World "The employees were warned that speaking to the news media meant loss of severance" Once the story broke the company ignored media contacts and plowed ahead on a double down strategy of cutting costs and pressuring employees vs focusing on a total quality management strategy that was recommended by members of the Board and its Founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/3002681/it-outsourcing/fury-and-fear-in-ohio-as-it-jobs-go-to-india.html|title=Fury and fear in Ohio as IT jobs go to India|first=Patrick|last=Thibodeau|work=computerworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chinese influences on [[Islamic pottery]]''' cover a period starting from at least the 8th century CE to the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Zheng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt; This influence of [[Chinese ceramics]] has to be viewed in the broader context of the considerable importance of Chinese culture on [[Islamic art]]s in general.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

==Earliest exchanges==

===Pre-Islamic contacts with Central Asia===
[[File:ZhouVase.JPG|thumb|left|[[Eastern Zhou]] vase, thought to incorporate Western influences (3rd–4th century BCE).]]
Despite the distances involved, there is evidence of some contact between eastern and southwestern Asia from antiquity. Some very early Western influence on Chinese pottery seems to appear from the 3rd–4th century BCE. An [[Eastern Zhou]] red earthenware bowl, decorated with [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] and inlaid with glass paste, and now in the British Museum, is thought to have imitated metallic vessels, possibly of foreign origin. Foreign influence especially is thought to have encouraged the Eastern Zhou interest in glass decorations.&lt;ref&gt;British Museum, Ancient China permanent exhibit&lt;/ref&gt;

Contacts between [[China]] and [[Central Asia]] were formally opened from the 2nd to 1st century BCE through the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt; In the following centuries, a great cultural influx benefited China, embodied by the appearance in China of foreign art, new ideas and religions (especially [[Buddhism]]), and new lifestyles.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt; Artistic influences combined a multiplicity of cultures which had intermixed along the Silk Road, especially [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[India]]n and [[Central Asian]] cultures, displaying a strong cosmopolitanism.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;

Such mixed influences are especially visible in the earthenwares of Northern China in the 6th century, such as those of the [[Northern Qi]] (550–577) or the [[Northern Zhou]] (557–581).&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt; In that period, high quality high-fired earthenware starts to appear, called the "jeweled type", which incorporates [[Lotus Flower|lotuses]] from Buddhist art, as well as elements of [[Sasanian]] designs such as pearl roundels, lion masks or musicians and dancers.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sz5KGNcs9xEC&amp;pg=PA119 ''The arts of China'' by Michael Sullivan p.119''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt; The best of these ceramics use bluish green, yellow or olive glazes.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"/&gt;

===Early Islamic period===

Direct contacts between the Muslim and Chinese worlds were marked by the [[Battle of Talas]] in 751 in [[Central Asia]]. Muslim communities are known to have been present in China as early as the 8th century CE, especially in commercial harbours such as [[Guangdong|Canton]] and [[Hangzhou]].&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

From the 9th century onwards, Islamic merchants started to import Chinese ceramics, which were at the core of the [[Indian Ocean]] luxury trade at that time.&lt;ref name="Meri"&gt;''Medieval Islamic civilization: an encyclopedia'' by Josef W. Meri, Jere L. Bacharach p.143 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MypbfKdMePIC&amp;pg=PA143]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; These exotic objects were cherished in the [[Islamic world]] and also became an inspiration for local potters.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

Archaeological finds of [[Chinese pottery]] in the [[Middle East]] go back to the 8th century, starting with Chinese pottery of the [[Tang period]] (618–907).&lt;ref name="Zheng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; Remains of [[Tang dynasty|Tang period]] (618–907) ceramics have been found in [[Samarra]] and [[Ctesiphon]] in present-day [[Iraq]], as well as in [[Nishapur]] in present-day [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="MET"&gt;Notice of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] permanent exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt; These include porcelaneous white wares from Northern Chinese kilns, celadon-glazed stoneware originating in the [[State of Yue|Yue]] kilns of Northern [[Zhejiang]], and the splashed stoneware of [[Changsha Tongguan Kiln Site|Changsha kilns]] in [[Hunan Province]].&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TV6f2XWG6t4C&amp;pg=PA68 ''Maritime silk road'' Qingxin Li p.68]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese pottery was the object of gift-making in Islamic lands: the Islamic writer Muhammad Ibn-al-Husain-Bahaki wrote in 1059 that [[Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan|Ali Ibn Isa]], the governor of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], presented [[Harun al-Rashid]], the Caliph, twenty pieces of Chinese imperial porcelain, the like of which had never been at a caliph's court before, in addition to 2,000 other pieces of porcelain".&lt;ref name="Zheng"&gt;''Studies in Chinese ceramics'' by Dekun Zheng, Cheng Te-K'Un p.90''ff'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=3die4xQmNzQC&amp;pg=PA90]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yuan and Ming dynasties===
[[File:Early blue and white ware circa 1335 Jingdezhen.jpg|thumb|Early Chinese [[blue and white porcelain]], c 1335, early [[Yuan dynasty]], [[Jingdezhen]], using a Middle-eastern shape]]
By the time of the [[Mongol invasion of China]] a considerable export trade westwards to the Islamic world was established, and Islamic attempts to imitate Chinese porcelain in their own [[fritware]] bodies had begun in the 12th century. These were less successful than those of [[Korean pottery]], but eventually were able to provide attractive local competition to Chinese imports.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, Ch. 5, pp. 134, 140–141 especially&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese production could adapt to the preferences of foreign markets; larger [[celadon]] dishes than the Chinese market wanted were favoured for serving princely banquets in the Middle East.  Celadon wares were believed there to have the ability to detect poison, by sweating or breaking.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;  After about 1450 celadon wares fell out of fashion in China, and the continuing production, of lower quality, was for export.

The Islamic market was apparently especially important in the early years of [[Chinese blue and white porcelain]], which appears to have been mainly exported until the Ming; it was called "Muslim blue" by the Chinese.  Again, large dishes were an export style, and the densely painted decoration of Yuan blue and white borrowed heavily from the [[arabesque]]s and [[scroll (art)|plant scrolls]] of Islamic decoration, probably mostly taking the style from metalwork examples, which also provided shapes for some vessels.  This style of ornament was then confined to blue and white, and is not found in the red and white painted wares then preferred by the Chinese themselves.  The [[cobalt blue]] that was used was itself imported from Persia, and the export trade in porcelain was handled by colonies of Muslim merchants in [[Quanzhou]], convenient for the huge [[Jingdezhen]] potteries, and other ports to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 137–140; Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 86–95&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of the [[Ming dynasty]] was quickly followed by a decree of 1368, forbidding trade with foreign countries.  This was not entirely successful, and had to be repeated several times, and the giving of lavish imperial diplomatic gifts continued, concentrating on silk and porcelain (19,000 pieces of porcelain in 1383), but it severely set back the export trade. The policy was relaxed under the next emperor after 1403, but had by then greatly stimulated the production of pottery emulating Chinese styles in the Islamic world itself, which was by now reaching a high level of quality in several countries (high enough to fool contemporary Europeans in many cases).&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 140–142&lt;/ref&gt;

Often Islamic production imitated not the latest Chinese styles, but those of the late Yuan and early Ming.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 140–141&lt;/ref&gt;  In turn, Chinese potters began in the early 16th century to produce some items in overtly Islamic styles, including jumbled inscriptions in Arabic. These appear to have been made for the growing Chinese Muslim market, and probably those at court wishing to keep up with the [[Zhengde Emperor]]'s (r. 1505–1521) flirtation with Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==

===Yue ware===
{{further|Yue ware}}
[[File:Tang Dynasty stoneware with celadon glaze ie Yue ware found in Samarra Iraq.jpg|thumb|[[Tang Dynasty]] stoneware with [[celadon]] [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] (Yue ware), found in [[Samarra]], [[Iraq]].]]
Yue ware originated in the [[State of Yue|Yue]] kilns of Northern [[Zhejiang]], in the site of [[Jiyuan]] near [[Shaoxing]], called "Yuezhou" (越州) in ancient times.&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sullivan90"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sn0CyBCJKz8C&amp;pg=PA90 ''The arts of China'' by Michael Sullivan p.90''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Yue ware was first manufactured from the 2nd century CE, when it consisted in some very precise imitations of [[bronze]] vessels, many of which were found in tombs of the [[Nanjing]] region.&lt;ref name="Sullivan90"/&gt; After this initial phase, Yue ware evolved progressively into true ceramic form, and became a true medium of artistic expression.&lt;ref name="Sullivan90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;''Chinese glazes: their origins, chemistry, and recreation'' Nigel Wood p.35''ff'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=NGw8DUuNywYC&amp;pg=PA35]&lt;/ref&gt; Production in Jiyuan stopped in the 6th century, but expanded to various areas of Zhejiang, especially around the shores of Shanglinhu in Yuyaoxian.&lt;ref name="Sullivan90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;

Yue ware was highly valued, and was used as tribute for the imperial court in northern China in the 9th century.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; Significantly, it was also used in China's most revered [[Famen Temple]] in [[Shaanxi Province]].&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; Yue ware was exported to the [[Middle East]] early on, and shards of Yue ware have been excavated in [[Samarra]], [[Iraq]], in an early example of Chinese influences on Islamic pottery,&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt; as well as to [[East Asia]] and [[South Asia]] as well as [[East Africa]] from the 8th to the 11th century.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;

===Sancai ware===

[[File:Tang sancai vase 8th 9th century.jpg|thumb|Tang ''[[sancai]]'' vase displaying Central Asian and Persian influence. 8–9th century. [[Guimet Museum]].]]
[[Tang period]] earthenware shards with low-fired [[polychrome]] three-color ''[[sancai]]'' glazes from the 9th century were exported to Middle-Eastern countries such as [[Iraq]] and [[Egypt]], and have been excavated in [[Samarra]] in present-day [[Iraq]] and in [[Nishapur]] in present-day [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="MET"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood205"&gt;''Chinese glazes: their origins, chemistry, and recreation'' Nigel Wood p.205''ff'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=NGw8DUuNywYC&amp;pg=PA206]&lt;/ref&gt; These Chinese styles were soon adopted for local [[Middle-Eastern]] manufactures. Copies were made by Iraqi craftsmen as soon as the 9th century CE.&lt;ref name="British Museum"&gt;Notice of [[British Museum]] "Islamic Art Room" permanent exhibit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brend"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ba3LyiGfPU8C&amp;pg=PA41 ''Islamic art'' by Barbara Brend p.41]&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to imitate Chinese ''Sancai'', lead glazes were used on top of vessels coated with white [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] and a colorless glaze. The coloured lead glazes were then splashed on the surface, where they spread and mixed, according to the [[slipware]] technique.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;

Shapes were also imitated, such as the lobed dishes found in Chinese Tang ceramics and silverware which were reproduced in Iraq during the 9–10th century.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

Conversely, numerous Central Asian and Persian influences were at work in the designs of Chinese ''sancai'' wares: pictures of Central Asian mounted warriors, scenes representing Central Asian musicians, vases in the shape of Middle-Eastern [[ewer]]s.

===White ware===

Soon after the sancai period, Chinese white ware ceramics also found their way to the [[Islamic world]],&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood205"/&gt; and were immediately reproduced.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; The Chinese white ware was actually [[porcelain]], invented in the 9th century, and used [[kaolin]] and high-temperature firing,&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt; but Islamic workshops were unable to duplicate its manufacture. Instead, they manufactured fine earthenware bowls with the desired shape, and covered them with a white glaze rendered [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] by the addition of [[tin]], an early example of [[tin-glazing]].&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brend"/&gt; The Chinese shapes were also reproduced, seemingly to pass for China-made wares.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;

In the 12th century, Islamic manufacturers further developed [[stone-paste]] techniques in order to obtain hard bodies approximating the hardness obtained by Chinese porcelain. This technique was used until the 18th century, when the Europeans discovered the Chinese technique for high-firing porcelain clays.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

===Celadon ware===
The Chinese fashion for greenware, or [[celadon]], ware was also transmitted to the Islamic world, where it gave rise to productions using [[turquoise]] glazing and fish motifs identical to the ones used in China.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

===Blue and white ware===

The technique of [[cobalt blue]] decorations seems to have been invented in the Middle East in the 9th century through decorative experimentation on white ware,&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt; and the technique of blue-and-white ware was developed in China in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/porcelain.aspx Porcelain.  ''Columbia Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; On some occasions, Chinese blue and white wares also incorporated Islamic designs, as in the case of some Mamluk brass works which were converted into blue and white Chinese porcelain designs.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; Chinese blue and white ware then became extremely popular in the Middle East, where both Chinese and Islamic types coexisted.&lt;ref name="Meri"/&gt;

From the 13th century, Chinese pictorial designs, such as flying [[Crane (bird)|cranes]], [[dragons]] and [[lotus flowers]] also started to appear in the ceramic productions of the Near East, especially in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt;

[[File:Ming incense burner 1575 1600 with Ottoman mount 1618.jpg|thumb|[[Ming Dynasty]] [[incense burner]] (1575–1600) with [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] metallic mount dated 1618. [[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum]].]]
Chinese porcelain of the 14th or 15th century was transmitted to the [[Middle East]] and the [[Near East]], and especially to the [[Ottoman Empire]] either through gifts or through war [[Looting|booty]]. Chinese designs were extremely influential with the pottery manufacturers at [[Iznik]], [[Turkey]]. The Ming "grape" design in particular was highly popular and was extensively reproduced under the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="British Museum"/&gt; The style of Persian pottery known as [[Kubachi ware]] also absorbed influence from China, imitating both celadons and Ming blue-and-white porcelain.

'''Choto Shona Mosque''' ({{lang-bn|ছোট সোনা মসজিদ}}, ''Small Golden Mosque'') is located in [[Chapai Nawabganj]] district of Bangladesh. The mosque is situated about {{convert|3|km}} south of the Kotwali Gate and {{convert|0.5|km}} to the south-east of the [[Mughal Tahakhana]] complex in the [[Firozpur Quarter]].

==History==
[[File:Choto Sona Mosque 1808.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Choto Shona Mosque in 1808]]
[[File:Sona Masjid rear.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Choto Shona Mosque (rear view)]]
The mosque was built during the reign of [[Alauddin Husain Shah|Sultan Hussain Shah]], between 1493 and 1519. The fifteen domes of the mosque were once gilded, giving the mosque the name of ''Choto Shona Masjid'' (''Small Golden Mosque'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangladesh.com/religious-sites/chhota-sona-masjid/ Chhota Sona Masjid. Gaur | By Bangladesh Channel]. Bangladesh.com. Retrieved on 2012-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The mosque is one of the best-preserved [[sultana (title)|sultana]] monuments under protection by the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Governments of Bangladesh. The gilding that gave the building its name does not exist anymore. The mosque premise, which covers an area of 42 m from east to west by 43.5 m from north to south, was originally surrounded by an outer wall (now restored) with a gateway in the middle of the east side.
[[File:Sona2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Plaque at the entrance with a short history of the mosque]]

==Design==
[[File:ছোট সোনা মসজিদ, চাঁপাইনবাবগঞ্জ.jpg|thumb|Choto Sona Mosque, view from outside]]
Built of brick and stone, the mosque proper forms a rectangle having outside dimensions of {{convert|25.1|m|ft}} from north to south and {{convert|15.9|m|ft}} from east to west. All the four walls are veneered externally and to some extent also internally with granite stone blocks. These stones have disappeared from the southern side of the west wall because of conservation works after the destruction by the [[1897 Assam earthquake|earthquake of 1897]]. The four exterior angles of the building are strengthened with polygonal towers, of which nine facets are visible. The cornices are curvilinear and have stone gutters to drain off the rain water from the roof. There are five arched doorways in the eastern facade and three each on the north and south walls. Corresponding to the five archways in the east wall there are five semi-circular ''mihrabs'' inside the west wall. The stones of most of these miharbs have disappeared.

The interior of the mosque, measuring {{convert|21.2|by|12.2|m}}, is divided into three aisles by two rows of stone pillars, four in each row. A wide central nave has cut the aisles into halves, each half showing six equal square units with a side of 3.5 m. The nave has three rectangular units, each measuring 3.5 by 4.5 m. The interior of the mosque has therefore a total of fifteen units, of which the three rectangular units are covered with ''chauchala'' vaults, and the remaining twelve square units each by an inverted tumbler-shaped dome. They are all carried on radiating arches springing from the free-standing stone pillars and the engaged pilasters. The upper corners in between the arches of the square units are filled with corbelled brick pendentive to make up the phase of transition for the domes. At the northwest corner of the mosque there is a royal gallery forming an upper floor, which is still standing in a dilapidated condition. It was approached from the northwest corner of the mosque through a stepped platform connected with a doorway. The gallery has a mihrab in front.

Stone carving, brick-setting, terracotta, gilding and glazed tiles were used in decorating the building, and of them the former played the dominant role. The subject matters of the stone carving were chosen according to the demand of the spaces, e.g., the borders of the panels with creepers and their interior with various forms of stylised hanging patterns adapted from the chain-and-bell of the Bauddha and Jaina period. The spandrels of arches and the spaces above the frames are always dotted with rosettes, an attractive form of designs, but are all carved differently. The interior of the domes and vaults are decorated with terracottas, those of the vaults being copies of the bamboo frames of local huts. All the frontal archways and those of the ''mihrabs'' are cusped.

[[File:Side view of Sona Mosjid.jpg|thumb|Side view of Sona Mosjid]]
==Ornamentation==
The most important ornamentation of the mosque is to be seen on the frontal courtyard of the mosque, only recently excavated. The ornamentation consists of mosaic roundels in blue and white colours of variegated design. The mosaic design is not ''in situ'', but a roundel has been composed by the excavators, putting the flakes in their appropriate places and exhibiting it in a room attached to the guesthouse nearby. At a distance of 14.5 m to the east of the gateway there is a stone platform containing two tomb sarcophagi inscribed with verses from the Quran and some names of God. It is unknown who is buried here. Cunningham suggests these are the tombs of Wali Muhammad, the builder of the mosque, and his father Ali.

==Current situation==
The glamour of the Chhoto Sona Masjid is not there as it was originally, particularly because of the stripping of the decorative mihrabs and the mosque courtyard, but the remains are nevertheless one of the most attractive monuments of Guar-Lakhnauti.

'''Christopher Newport University''', '''CNU''', is a public [[Liberal Arts College|liberal arts university]] in [[Newport News]], [[Virginia]]. CNU is the youngest comprehensive university in the commonwealth of Virginia. The institution is named after [[Christopher Newport]], who was a [[buccaneer]] (or [[privateer]]) and captain of the ''[[Susan Constant]]'', the largest of three ships which carried settlers for the [[Virginia Company]] in 1607, on their way to found [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in the [[Virginia Colony]], which became the first permanent [[Kingdom of England|English]] settlement in North America.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CNUmcmurran.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Making "History" as the new McMurran Hall is opened on the night of Monday, January 4, 2010 --&gt;

In 1960 the city of Newport News joined together with the [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] to create Christopher Newport College (CNC), which opened its doors in 1961&lt;ref&gt;[http://about.cnu.edu/history.cfm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007010819/http://about.cnu.edu/history.cfm |date=October 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the time was located in the old [[John W. Daniel]] School building. The college was founded as an extension of the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] and offered extension courses that had already been available in the area for some time. In 1964 the college was relocated to its current location, a {{convert|75|acre|m2|adj=on}} tract of land purchased and donated by the city. In this same year, the college's first permanent building was dedicated as Christopher Newport Hall. In 1971, CNC became a four-year college;&lt;ref name="Q179"&gt;(Quarstein 179)&lt;/ref&gt; however, it remained an extension of William &amp; Mary until 1977 when it attained its independence.&lt;ref&gt;(Quarstein 209)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the college became a university under the leadership of President Anthony R. Santoro, who oversaw the building of the first residence hall.
In 1996, CNU made plans to become more competitive. Those plans included the expansion of University property, several new buildings and residence halls, as well as overhauling academic programs and the admission process.

==Athletics==
{{main|Christopher Newport Captains}}
CNU participates mainly in the [[Capital Athletic Conference]] (CAC), having moved from the [[USA South Athletic Conference]] in July 2013. The football team remains a USA South associate member because the CAC does not sponsor football. CNU fields a wide variety of college level teams on the Division III level. The Freeman Center houses the basketball, volleyball, and indoor track teams, while the lacrosse, soccer, baseball, softball, and field hockey teams play at a complex called "Captain's Field." The football and outdoor track teams compete at [[Pomoco Stadium]], named for a local car dealership chain. Ratcliffe Hall was expanded in 2012 and now includes various athletic offices as well as the varsity gym. A sailing center is also located close to the campus along the James river.

CNU sports club programs include ice hockey,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051025154345/http://clubs.users.cnu.edu/hockey/ CNU Ice Hockey - Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; equestrian, dressage, cycling, fishing, lacrosse, martial arts,&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/a/cnu.edu/cnumac/ ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; rock climbing, rugby, scuba diving, silver storm dance, soccer, swimming, table tennis, tennis, ultimate frisbee, rowing and volleyball.

==Campus==
[[File:CaptChristopherNewportStatue01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Statue of Sir Christopher Newport]]

===Boundaries===
[[File:CNU Campus.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Great Lawn of Christopher Newport University, featuring the David Student Union and the McMurran and Forbes academic buildings.]]
The traditional boundaries of the Christopher Newport University campus have been Warwick Boulevard, Shoe Lane, and Prince Drew Road in Newport News. In recent years, however, the university has "jumped" Warwick Boulevard, buying and demolishing properties in the immediate area to expand. The part of campus that is east of Warwick Boulevard is referred to as "East Campus" and is primarily used to house upper-class students.

===Residence halls===
Residence halls on campus are usually segregated into the class of student living in them. In the recent years, new policies have been enacted that require all freshman and sophomore students to live in an on campus housing facility, unless they live in the commuting zone. Starting with the class of 2014, all students must live on campus during the junior year in addition to their freshman and sophomore years.

;Freshman housing
The oldest housing facility on campus is Santoro Hall. Opened in 1992, the hall was named in honor of then President Anthony Santoro and his wife, Carol. This building is directly adjacent to one of the campus dining facilities, the Hiden-Hussey Commons. Santoro Hall, along with the newer York River Hall, is primarily used for freshman housing. York River Hall opened in 2002. This complex, consisting of two buildings (York River East/ York River West), houses over 500 students and is the largest residence hall on campus. Both Santoro and York River Halls are suite-style living residence halls. In each building, pairs of neighboring housing units share a common private restroom. Freshman also live in portions of Potomac River Hall.

;Upperclassmen housing
[[File:Potomac River Hall.jpg|thumb|left|300px|York River Hall]] Sophomore housing currently consists of James River Hall, opened in 2000, half of Potomac River Hall, opened in 2004, as well as Warwick River Hall, opened in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://housing.cnu.edu/residence.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109053147/http://housing.cnu.edu/residence.html%23 |date=November 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; James River Hall boasts a variety of floor plans, including 4, 5, and 6-person apartments, 4-person suites, and three 15-person Theme Units. Potomac Hall, like York River Hall, is divided into two buildings (North/ South), and consists of suites of two bedrooms, located around a central living room and bath. Warwick River Hall is the newest residence hall on campus and accommodates 447 students in 4, 5, and 6-person suites each with a shared living room and bathroom.

[[File:CNU Rappahanock Hall.gif|thumb|right|Rappahannock River Hall at Christopher Newport University]]Juniors and Seniors living on campus are generally assigned to either East Campus or Rappahannock River Hall. James River Hall also accommodates Juniors and Seniors in apartment style dorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cnu.edu/housing/residencehalls/|title=Residence Halls|website=cnu.edu|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNU is currently planning construction on a dedicated upperclassmen residence, to be called "Shenandoah Hall." It is expected to house more than 200 seniors and to open in summer 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Brett|title=New upperclassman housing to grace CNU’s campus|url=http://www.thecaptainslog.org/2017/news/new-upperclassman-housing-to-grace-cnus-campus/|website=The Captain's Log|publisher=Christopher Newport University|accessdate=19 October 2017|date=6 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906224649/http://www.thecaptainslog.org/2017/news/new-upperclassman-housing-to-grace-cnus-campus/|archive-date=2017-09-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2009, five sororities and four fraternities live in Barclay Apartments, CNU's temporary Greek Village, and any additional fraternities and sororities live in the adjacent townhouses of CNU Landing {{as of|2012|lc=y}}. Completed in 2002, CNU Apartments is a complex of five buildings of three or four stories, housing up to 355 students. These buildings, named after Virginia-born presidents, include Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Harrison, and Monroe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://housing.cnu.edu/apartments.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194451/http://housing.cnu.edu/apartments.html |date=July 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNU Village rose to accompany CNU Apartments in 2005, adding room for an additional 398 students in apartment living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://housing.cnu.edu/Villagefloorplans.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327173031/http://housing.cnu.edu/Villagefloorplans.html |date=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the apartments and the Village feature 2 to 4 single bedroom apartments with a common living area (full kitchen, living room/dinette, washer and dryer). Below CNU Village, along Warwick Blvd., are a variety of eating establishments including Panera Bread, Moe's Southwest Grill, Subway, 7-11, Sushi &amp; Spice, and Schooners, opened by three local restaurateurs who wanted to fill a void left by the lack of a social outlet on campus.

===Dining facilities===
The campus has two major dining facilities, Hiden-Hussey Commons and Regattas.

'''Hiden-Hussey Commons'''

The first dining facility on campus was originally named Harbour Lights. This all-you-can-eat cafeteria style facility is decorated internally with nautical memorabilia to go along with its name. In 2005 Harbour Lights was renamed to the Hiden-Hussey Commons. Newer students just refer to it as "The Commons." The dining hall was expanded in 2012 to include additional seating, serving lines, and a patio.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

'''Regattas'''

Regattas Restaurant is the newest dining hall on CNU's campus. Opened in 2002 inside the David Student Union, Regattas shares a similar format to the Hiden-Hussey Commons with the all-you-can-eat cafeteria style.  Regattas, however, sports a more up-tempo environment{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} and often features hand made waffle cones for ice cream and custom made omelettes.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} It is also home to CNU's Mongolian Grill&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cnu.edu/life/dining/dininghalls/|title=Dining Halls: Regatta's|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.   Regattas began an expansion in 2017 which was completed in Spring of 2018.

===The David Student Union===
[[File:DSU1.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The David Student Union]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TheStreet.jpg|thumb|right|Main Corridor of the "DSU"]] --&gt;
The David Student Union (DSU) is a $36 million, {{convert|116000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} facility whose construction began in 2003 and opened September 9, 2006. Constructed in a "Neo-[[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]" architectural style, the first floor contains the campus Convenience Store, parallel the DSU dining facilities: The Discovery Bistro, Discovery Cafe, [[Chick-fil-A]], Discovery [[Pizza]], and Regatta's. The campus Bookstore and Convenience Store closed during the Fall 2010 semester in favor of an online bookstore and instead contains a student lounge, admissions office, and apparel store. All on-campus students receive a mailbox and access to a full-service Post Office located on the second floor of the DSU. Four large conference rooms named for past U.S. Presidents are located around a central lobby area at the top of the steps. The Ballroom is also located on the second floor. The building provides offices for Student Life, The Captain's Log, Career Development, International Studies, Academic Advising, and others. Private desks with computers are provided for students as well as quiet study sections and recreational areas. The building was named in honor of William R. and Goldie R. David.

===Academic buildings===
For the opening of the Spring 2010 semester, Christopher Newport University opened the Lewis Archer McMurran, Jr. Hall. This building has neo-Georgian architecture. The building is 85,000 square feet and frames the university's Great Lawn on its western side. McMurran Hall houses the Departments of Modern and Classical Languages and Literatures, History, English, and Government. It has a 150-person lecture hall, two 50-person lecture halls, and over 25 other  classrooms.

To the north of McMurran Hall is Ratcliffe Hall, the former home of the Departments of English and Government. Once CNU's gymnasium, the building was renovated to include classroom and office space for students and faculty. Other academic buildings on campus include Gosnold Hall, Forbes Hall, and the Business and Technology Center (BTC Building), located across Prince Drew Lane. Finally, the [[Ferguson Center]] for the Arts is home to the Departments of Music and Theater &amp; Dance.

Wingfield Hall, the former home of the Departments of Psychology and Language, was demolished in 2011 to make way for the Joseph W. Luter Hall, home of the school of business.

The Joseph W. Luter, III Hall is the house of the Luter School of Business. The building, following the Neo-Georgian architecture of surrounding new structures, has a new 100-seat tiered lecture hall, 14 traditional classrooms, teachings labs, research labs and faculty offices.

The Mary Brock Forbes Integrated Science Building is a 156,000 sq ft academic hall situated on the north edge of the  great lawn, and houses the College of Natural and Behavioral Science as well as the Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science and Psychology departments. It also includes spaces for students to interact, 50 faculty offices, a large lecture hall, 50 classrooms, and research labs.

===The Paul and Rosemary Trible Library===
[[File:Christopher-Newport-University-C66051C5.jpg|thumb|right| Paul and Rosemary Trible Library]]

[[File:CNU Entrance.jpg|thumb|left|300px| The entrance to Christopher Newport University, featuring the York River Hall freshman residence hall, the Trible Library, and the Pope Chapel.]]
The university's library, renamed for Rosemary and [[Paul S. Trible, Jr.]], had a multimillion-dollar addition completed in early 2008. The new {{convert|110000|sqft|adj=on}} facility houses most of its collection in the original section. The new library was dedicated January 24, 2008, and fully opened at the start of the Spring 2008 semester. The Trible Library boasts a new Einstein's Cafe, a 24-hour study lounge, and an IT help desk.

In early 2009, the [[Mariners' Museum]] Library relocated to the Trible Library, providing students and the community with convenient access to the largest [[maritime history]] collection in the [[Western Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariner.org/library/about-library |title=About the Library |publisher=Mariners' Museum |date=1933-10-29 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paul and Rosemary Trible Library was slated for another expansion beginning in 2016 which would add another floor to the back portion of the facility. Due to the renovations, the Mariners' Museum Library moved back to the Mariners' Museum and reopened in Fall 2017.

In August of 2018, the library expansion opened adding 3 floors of new space.  Additions included a 100 seat theater, expanded Media Center, a two-story reading room, and 44 group study rooms.

===Ferguson Center for the Arts===
In 1996 the university acquired the [[Homer L. Ferguson High School|Ferguson High School]] building and property, which was adjacent to campus. This building was used for classrooms until it was extensively renovated to become the [[Ferguson Center for the Arts]], which opened in fall of 2005. Many features of the original high school, which was located between what is now the concert hall and the music and theatre hall, can still be seen throughout the current building. It houses a 1,725-seat concert hall which is acoustically engineered so that anyone on stage can be heard from any seat without a microphone, A 453-seat music and theatre hall, and a 200-seat studio theatre. It also contains two art galleries, a dance studio, and several classrooms.

===Pope Chapel===

Opened in early 2013, the Pope Chapel, named for Larry Pope of Smithfield Foods, is a 14,000 square foot gathering place for various on campus religious organizations located at the campus entrance across from York River Hall and the Trible Library.

===Christopher Newport Hall===
[[File:NewportHall May2015.jpg|alt=Christopher Newport Hall|left|thumb|250x250px|Christopher Newport Hall during the May 2015 commencement ceremony.]]
In the fall of 2015 a new administration building was opened and named Christopher Newport Hall. The 81,000 square foot structure houses the Office of Admission, Office of the Registrar, Financial Aid, Housing, the Center for Academic Success, the President's Leadership Program and the Center for Career Planning, among others. The $42 million facility serves as a new landmark on campus and is at the head of the Great Lawn opposite Lewis Archer McMurran, Jr. Hall. In May 2015, towards the end of construction, Newport Hall served as the backdrop for commencement ceremonies.

The '''Circle of Friends''' approach is a method designed to increase the [[socialization]] and [[Inclusion (education)|inclusion]] of a [[disabled]] person with their peers.  A Circle of Friends consists of a "focus" child, for whom the group was established, six to eight classroom peers, and an adult facilitator who meet once weekly to socialize and work on specific goals.  Most available resources about the Circle of Friends approach are geared toward its use with school-aged children with various difficulties.

==Background==
Circle of Friends was originally developed in [[North America]] to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities and other difficulties in their local communities and in mainstream educational settings.&lt;ref&gt;Leicestershire County Council, England. [http://www.leics.gov.uk/search.htm?qt=circle+of+friends&amp;col=all&amp;ﬂag. Autism Outreach Team, Circle of Friends]. Retrieved April 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The National Autistic Society: Circle of Friends – [http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1757&amp;a=15944 Promoting inclusion and interaction]. Retrieved April 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt;  In the past, it was more common for adults with disabilities to be [[institutionalization|confined to institutions]], and for students with [[special education|special educational needs]] to be educated in separate schools.&lt;ref&gt;Frederickson, N. &amp; Turner, J. (2003). Utilizing the classroom peer group to address children's social needs: An evaluation of the Circle of Friends intervention approach. The Journal of Special Education, 36, 234-245.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Circle of Friends approach coincides with a shift in societal attitudes toward inclusion of people with disabilities in mainstream settings.  It is intended to promote healthy friendships and to create and reinforce positive social experiences.

Although it was developed in North America, Circle of Friends has been implemented and researched extensively in the United Kingdom in a variety of settings, and with children of varying ages and difficulties.&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt;&lt;ref name=newton&gt;Newton, C., Taylor, G., &amp; Wilson, D. (1996). Circles of Friends: An inclusive approach to meeting emotional and behavioural needs. Educational Psychology in Practice, 11, 41-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shotton&gt;Shotton, G. (1998). A Circles of Friends approach for socially neglected children. Educational Psychology in Practice, 14, 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor96/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor97/&gt; The approach is often used for children with [[Autism Spectrum Disorders]] (ASDs) because they have trouble developing social and communication skills.&lt;ref name=whitaker&gt;Whitaker, P., Barratt, P., Joy, H., Potter, M., &amp; Thomas, G. (1998). Children with autism and peer group support: Using "circles of friends". British Journal of Special Education, 25, 60–64.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, children with emotional, behavioral and social problems may benefit from the approach because they are often isolated and lack peer groups.&lt;ref name=newton/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor96&gt;Taylor, G. (1996). Creating a Circle of Friends: A case study. In H. Cowie &amp; S. Sharp (Eds.), Peer counselling in schools. London: Barry Fulton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pearpoint&gt;Pearpoint, J., Forest, M., &amp; Snow, J. (1992). The inclusion papers. Toronto: Inclusion Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
In the educational setting, general guidelines exist for establishing a Circle of Friends.&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor96/&gt;&lt;ref name=taylor97&gt;Taylor, G. (1997). Community building in schools: Developing a 'circle of friends.' Educational and Child Psychology, 14, 45-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederickson, N., Warren, L. &amp; Turner, J. (2005). "Circle of Friends" – An exploration of impact over time. Educational Psychology in Practice, 21, 197-217&lt;/ref&gt;

* Establishment of prerequisites: Before starting a Circle of Friends, it is necessary to ensure the cooperation and collaboration of school personnel (e.g. principals, teacher) and obtain consent from the focus child’s parents or caregivers.
* Class discussion to set up the Circle of Friends: The next step is to meet with the focus child’s class.  The focus child consents to this meeting but does not attend so that class members feel comfortable sharing information.  The class discussion is meant to introduce the idea of a Circle of Friends.  Students are encouraged to think about the benefits of friendship and consider the barriers to friendship the focus child encounters, and also empathize and share their own experiences with friendship.  The focus child’s strengths and difficulties are discussed, and links between the focus child’s behavior and problems with peer relationships are made.  Making these links is an important first step in problem solving solutions.  At the close of the meeting, six to eight volunteers are sought to take part in the Circle of Friends.
* Initial meeting of the Circle of Friends: At the initial Circle of Friends meeting, details of the class discussion are summarized for the focus child.  Ground rules for the group are then set (i.e. confidentiality, listening, seeking adult help when needed), as well as a schedule for meetings.
* Weekly meetings of the Circle of Friends: At weekly meetings, classmates play an important role in helping the focus child set and reach goals.  Some research suggests that all children involved in the Circle of Friends benefit from the experience and not just the focus child.&lt;ref name=newton/&gt;

Adapted versions of Circle of Friends exist.  One version differs from the original approach in that the focus child is not absent for the initial class meeting.&lt;ref name=shotton/&gt;  Others have described Circle of Friends meetings taking place on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.txautism.net/docs/Guide/Interventions/CircleFriends.pdf Texas Autism Research Guide for Effective Teaching (TARGET)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724114405/http://www.txautism.net/docs/Guide/Interventions/CircleFriends.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}.

A '''climate-friendly school''' is a school that uses [[education for sustainable development]] (ESD) to promote a culture of sustainability in which students, staff and families hold shared values and beliefs about the importance of taking action for a more sustainable society. Taking care of the environment and contributing to reducing [[climate change]] is an integral part of this. [[Climate action]] means different things to different schools. Some schools see climate action as key to “doing their part” to take care of the planet. For other schools, it is about addressing issues directly affecting them. For example, several schools in disaster-prone [[Japan]] see climate action as a practical way of helping students and their families stay safe and prepare for the future.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002467/246740e.pdf|title=Getting Climate-Ready: A Guide for Schools on Climate Action|last=Gibb|first=Natalie|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100193-2|location=|pages=5, 7–8, 10, 15, 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Whole-school approach to climate action ==
[[File:Figure 1 Whole school approach to climate change Getting Climate-Ready.svg|thumb|The whole-school approach to climate change]]
In a whole-school approach, students’ classroom learning about climate change is reinforced by the formal and informal messages promoted by the school’s values and actions. In other words, students and other members of the school community live what they learn, and learn what they live. The whole-school approach to climate change means that an educational institution includes action for reducing climate change in every aspect of school life. This includes school governance, teaching content and methodology, campus and facilities management as well as cooperation with partners and the broader communities. The active involvement of all internal and external school stakeholders, namely students, teachers, principals, school staff at all levels and the wider school community such as families and community members in reflecting and acting on climate change is key to a whole-school approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== 1st Experimental Lyceum of Athens-Gennadeio, Athens, Greece ===
As an experimental school, the 1st Experimental Lyceum of Athens-Gennadeio is encouraged to introduce innovative programmes. In 2013, the school introduced complex systems into biology and chemistry courses for 157 senior secondary students. In the complex systems unit, students worked in groups to investigate climate change, virus transmission, and ecosystem dynamics with the help of computer simulations. Through their investigations, students discovered the properties of complex systems, such as positive and negative [[Feedback|feedback loops]]. They also had opportunities to apply their learning. For example, a group of students measured the energy sustainability of the school building, to find its weaknesses and construct an action plan to improve it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Al-Kawthar Secondary School, Beirut, Lebanon ===
Al-Kawthar Secondary School works to raise awareness of climate change within their school. So far, 2,421 students, 310 teachers, and 110 families have been involved in projects including [[Tree planting|tree-planting]], making handicrafts from recycled materials, visiting national forests, recycling, and conserving water. The school also hosted film nights and workshops where students, families and teachers suggested ways to save the planet. Following the ISO-26000 guidelines for socially responsible institutions, the school has committed to a continuous process of improvement. At the beginning of the school year, the environmental committee develops an action plan based on what was learned and achieved the previous year. The committee keeps a record of their activities, so the school can identify high-impact activities and activities that could be scaled up. Teachers and students deepen their learning by sharing their experiences with other schools in [[Lebanon]] and around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ASPnet Schools, Côte d’Ivoire ===
In [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]], one of the most widespread uses of forest resources is in [[traditional medicine]] which is of vital importance with regard to primary health care and contributes to preserving traditional knowledge and cultural heritage. Realizing that the biodiversity of their forests is under threat, the [[UNESCO ASPNet|ASPnet]] schools, together with university researchers and medical practitioners, united their forces to come to the rescue of the forest resources in Côte d'Ivoire. The schools promote botanical gardens where parents as well as traditional medicine practitioners teach students how to conserve and manage forest resources in a more sustainable way. Through the study visits in the botanical garden, students acquire traditional knowledge of medicinal plant cultivation which will enable them to identify, protect, preserve and promote the medicinal plants which have tremendous ecological and cultural importance in Côte d'Ivoire. In collaboration with the experts and researchers, the ASPnet schools are now considering creating a genebank as well as replanting endangered species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Colégio Israelita Brasileiro A. Liessen, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil ===
Colégio Israelita Brasileiro A. Liessen's environment team has invited janitors, teachers, students, engineers and others to participate in experiential, non-formal learning activities. They created a [[green roof]], built [[Solar cooker|solar ovens]] and bamboo bicycle racks, planted spice, flower, and meditation gardens, and converted used cooking oil into [[biodiesel]]. These activities have created bonds between different members of the school community, awakened a sense of belonging and pride in the school, and built an environment where ideas and information are shared freely. The environment team has also offered trainings for school community members in order to secure buy-in for the projects. For example, training on waste sorting and cooking oil collection was offered to employees. Also, a gardening workshop was organized for student volunteers, so they could assist maintenance staff in caring for the expanding school gardens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Endrupskolen School, Fredensborg, Denmark ===
Thanks to a partnership with a local non-profit organization, Endrupskolen School offers students inspiring and hands-on learning experiences. Eight times throughout the school year, students visit gardens, farms and kitchens run by the non-profit organization “Haver til Maver.” During each visit, classes meet experts such as farmers, cooks, biologists or gardeners who guide students in exploring plants, trees, vegetables, smells and tastes. According to Endrupskolen teachers, these visits have given students the skills and commitment needed to build better food futures for themselves, their families and society as a whole. In addition, learning outside the traditional classroom has helped students develop better relationships with their peers and a better sense of self-esteem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nagoya International School, Nagoya, Japan ===
The [[Nagoya International School]] is committed to developing a school culture of sustainability, as expressed in their school mission statement. The institution aims to “nurture in its students the capacity to objectively define what is truly needed in the global society, to take action on their own, and to become active agents for [[sustainable development]].”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation, Japan (and global) ===
'''Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation''' is an education-services organization that provides capstone education programs free of charge to engineering students and other stakeholders. These programs are intended to complement—but not to replace—coursework required by academic degree programs of study. The programs are educational opportunities, and students are not paid money for their participation. All correspondence among members is completed via e-mail, and all meetings are held via Skype, with English as the language of instruction and publication. Students and other stakeholders are never asked to travel or leave their geographic locations, and are encouraged to publish organizational documents in their personal, primary languages, when English is a secondary language.

The '''comedy of intrigue''', also known as the '''comedy of situation''', is a [[Literary genre|genre]] of [[comedy]] in which [[Action (philosophy)|dramatic action]] is prioritised over the development of [[Character (arts)|character]], complicated strategems and conspiracies drive the plot, and [[Farce|farcical humour]] and contrived or ridiculous dramatic situations are often employed.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster (1995, 261) and Pavis (1998, 65).&lt;/ref&gt; Characterisation tends to be defined only vaguely and the plot gives the illusion of dynamic, constant movement.&lt;ref&gt;Pavis (1998, 65).&lt;/ref&gt; The German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] argued that characters pursue their aims in such comedies via the use of [[deception]].&lt;ref&gt;Paolucci (1978, 101).&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was first developed in the [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatre of classical Rome]] by [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]].&lt;ref&gt;Law (2011, 120).&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of comedies of intrigue include [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Niccolò Machiavelli's]] ''[[The Mandrake]]'' (1524), the [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] Italian play ''[[The Deceived Ones]]'' (1531), [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (c. 1596) and "[[Much Ado About Nothing]]", [[Thomas Heywood]]'s ''[[The Wise Woman of Hoxton]]'' (c. 1604), [[Molière]]'s ''[[Scapin the Schemer]]'' (1671), and the plays of [[Aphra Behn]] and [[Thomas D'Urfey]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohn (1998, 234), Hochman (1984, 251), and Pavis (1998, 65).&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, concept inventories have been in the form of [[multiple-choice test]]s in order to aid interpretability and facilitate administration in large classes.  Unlike a typical, teacher-authored multiple-choice test, questions and response choices on concept inventories are the subject of extensive research. The aims of the research include ascertaining (a) the range of what individuals think a particular question is asking and (b) the most common responses to the questions. Concept inventories are evaluated to ensure test [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[validity (statistics)|validity]]. In its final form, each question includes one correct answer and several distractors.

Ideally, a score on a criterion-referenced test reflects the amount of content knowledge a student has mastered. Criterion-referenced tests differ from [[norm-referenced tests]] in that (in theory) the former is not used to compare an individual's score to the scores of the group. Ordinarily, the purpose of a criterion-referenced test is to ascertain whether a student mastered a predetermined amount of content knowledge; upon obtaining a test score that is at or above a [[cutscore|cutoff score]], the student can move on to study a body of content knowledge that follows next in a learning sequence. In general, item difficulty values ranging between 30% and 70% are best able to provide information about student understanding.

The distractors are incorrect or irrelevant answers that are usually (but not always) based on students' commonly held misconceptions.&lt;ref&gt;"Development and Validation of Instruments to Measure Learning of Expert-Like Thinking." W. K. Adams &amp; C. E. Wieman, 2010. International Journal of Science Education, 1-24. iFirst, {{doi|10.1080/09500693.2010.512369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test developers often research student misconceptions by examining students' responses to open-ended essay questions and conducting "think-aloud" interviews with students. The distractors chosen by students help researchers understand student thinking and give instructors insights into students' prior knowledge (and, sometimes, firmly held beliefs).  This foundation in research underlies instrument construction and design, and plays a role in helping educators obtain clues about students' ideas, [[scientific misconceptions]], and [[didaskalogenic]] ("teacher-induced" or "teaching-induced") confusions and conceptual lacunae that interfere with learning.

==Concept inventories in use==
Concept inventories are education-related diagnostic tests.&lt;ref name="Tregust, 1988"&gt;Tregust, D.F. 1988. Development and use of diagnostic tests to evaluate students' misconceptions in science.  International Journal of Science Education 10: 159-169 [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0950069880100204#.VKMeQsZl5FI]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985 Halloun and Hestenes introduced a "multiple-choice mechanics diagnostic test" to examine students' concepts about motion.&lt;ref name="Halloun and Hestenes"&gt;Hallouin, I. A., &amp; Hestenes, D. Common sense concepts about motion (1985). American Journal of Physics, 53, 1043-1055&lt;/ref&gt;  It evaluates student understanding of basic concepts in classical (macroscopic) mechanics. A little later, the [[Force Concept Inventory]] (FCI), another concept inventory, was developed.&lt;ref name="Halloun and Hestenes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hestenes D, Wells M, Swackhamer G 1992 Force concept inventory. The Physics Teacher 30: 141-166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/vsearch/servlet/VerityServlet?KEY=AJPIAS&amp;CURRENT=NO&amp;ONLINE=YES&amp;smode=strresults&amp;sort=rel&amp;maxdisp=25&amp;threshold=0&amp;pjournals=AJPIAS&amp;pyears=2001%2C2000%2C1999&amp;possible1=465&amp;possible1zone=fpage&amp;fromvolume=66&amp;SMODE=strsearch&amp;OUTLOG=NO&amp;viewabs=AJPIAS&amp;key=DISPLAY&amp;docID=1&amp;page=1&amp;chapter=0 Hestenes D 1998. Am. J. Phys. 66:465]&lt;/ref&gt; The FCI was designed to assess student understanding of the [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian]] concepts of force.  Hestenes (1998) found that while "nearly 80% of the [students completing introductory college physics courses] could state [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Third Law]] at the beginning of the course. FCI data showed that less than 15% of them fully understood it at the end".These results have been replicated in a number of studies involving students at a range of institutions (see sources section below).   That said, there remains questions as what exactly the FCI measures.&lt;ref name="Huffman"&gt;Huffman, D. &amp; P. Heller. 1995. What does the force concept inventory actually measure? The Physics Teacher 33: 138-143; Heller, P. &amp; D. Huffman. 1995.[http://www.physics.emory.edu/faculty/weeks//journal/hestenes-tpt95c.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Results from Hake (1998) using the FCI have led to greater recognition in the [[science education]] community of the importance of students' "interactive engagement" with the materials to be mastered.&lt;ref name="Hake"&gt;Hake, R. R. 1998. Interactive-engagement versus traditional methods: a six-thousand-student survey of mechanics test data for introductory physics courses. Am. J.

In many areas, foundational scientific concepts transcend disciplinary boundaries. An example of an inventory that assesses knowledge of such concepts is an instrument developed by  Odom and Barrow (1995) to evaluate understanding of [[diffusion]] and [[osmosis]].&lt;ref name="Odom"&gt;Odom AL, Barrow LH 1995 Development and application of a two-tier diagnostic test measuring college biology students' understanding of diffusion and osmosis after a course of instruction. Journal of Research In Science Teaching 32: 45-61.&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition, there are non-multiple choice conceptual instruments, such as the essay-based approach suggested by Wright et al. (1998)&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;[http://bioliteracy.colorado.edu/Readings/Wright.pdf Wright et al., 1998. J. Chem. Educ. 75: 986-992]&lt;/ref&gt; and the essay and oral exams used by Nehm and Schonfeld (2008).&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt; and Cooper et al &lt;ref&gt;Cooper, M. M.; Underwood, S.

==Caveats associated with concept inventory use==
Some concept inventories are problematic.  The concepts tested may not be fundamental or important in a particular discipline, the concepts involved may not be explicitly taught in a class or curriculum, or answering a question correctly may require only a superficial understanding of a topic.  It is therefore possible to either over-estimate or under-estimate student content mastery.  While concept inventories designed to identify trends in student thinking may not be useful in monitoring learning gains as a result of pedagogical interventions, disciplinary mastery may not be the variable measured by a particular instrument.  Users should be careful to ensure that concept inventories are actually testing conceptual understanding, rather than test-taking ability, language skills, or other abilities that can influence test performance.

The use of multiple-choice exams as concept inventories is not without controversy.   The very structure of multiple-choice type concept inventories raises questions involving the extent to which complex, and often nuanced situations and ideas must be simplified or clarified to produce unambiguous responses.  For example, a multiple-choice exam designed to assess knowledge of key concepts in natural selection&lt;ref name="AFN"/&gt; does not meet a number of standards of quality control.&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2010"/&gt; One problem with the exam is that the two members of each of several pairs of parallel items, with each pair designed to measure exactly one key concept in natural selection, sometimes have very different levels of difficulty.&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt; Another problem is that the multiple-choice exam overestimates knowledge of natural selection as reflected in student performance on a diagnostic essay exam and a diagnostic oral exam, two instruments with reasonably good [[construct validity]].&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt;   Although scoring concept inventories in the form of essay or oral exams is labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to implement with large numbers of students, such exams can offer a more realistic appraisal of the actual levels of students' conceptual mastery as well as their misconceptions.&lt;ref name="Wright"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nehm &amp; Schonfeld 2008"/&gt; Recently, however, computer technology has been developed that can [[Automated essay scoring|score essay responses]] on concept inventories in biology and other domains (Nehm, Ha, &amp; Mayfield, 2011),&lt;ref&gt;Nehm, R.H., Ha, M., Mayfield, E.

[http://www.springerlink.com/content/1059-0145/preprint/?sort=p_OnlineDate&amp;sortorder=desc&amp;o=30]&lt;/ref&gt; promising to facilitate the scoring of concept inventories organized as (transcribed) oral exams as well as essays.

The communicative constitution of organizations (CCO) perspective is broadly characterized by the claim that communication is not something that happens within organizations or between organizational members; instead, communication is the process whereby organizations are constituted. Specifically, this view contends: “organization is an effect of communication not its predecessor." &lt;ref name="Blaschke2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lou.econ.uni-hamburg.de/tag/communication-as-constitutive/|title=Building Blocks of Postmodern Organizational Communication|last=Blaschke|first=Steffen|date=13 November 2009|publisher=Universitat Hamburg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112042548/http://lou.econ.uni-hamburg.de/tag/communication-as-constitutive/|archivedate=12 January 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=19 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective is part of a broader constitutive view of communication arguing, "elements of communication, rather than being fixed in advance, are reflexively constituted within the act of communication itself".&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=Robert T.|title=Communication|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~craigr/Communication.htm|work=Encyclopedia of Rhetoric|date=3 September 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220030311/http://spot.colorado.edu/~craigr/Communication.htm|archivedate=20 December 2011|deadurl=yes|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of the perspective==

The model of communication as constitutive of organizations has origins in the linguistic approach to organizational communication taken in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Blaschke"&gt;{{cite web|last=Blaschke|first=Steffen|url=http://lou.econ.uni-hamburg.de/tag/communication-as-constitutive/|title=Building Blocks of Postmodern Organizational Communication|publisher=Universitat Hamburg|date=13 November 2009|accessdate=19 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112042548/http://lou.econ.uni-hamburg.de/tag/communication-as-constitutive/|archivedate=12 January 2015|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists such as [[Karl E. Weick]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weick|first=Karl|title=The social psychology of organizing|year=1979|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; were among the first to posit that organizations were not static but inherently comprised by a dynamic process of communicating.

The notion of a communicative constitution of organization comprises three schools of thought:&lt;ref name="Schools"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schoeneborn|first=Dennis|author2=Steffen Blaschke|title=The Three Schools of CCO Thinking:Interactive Dialogue and Systematic Comparison.|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|volume=28|issue=2|year=2014|pages=285–316|url=http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/28/2/285.abstract|doi=10.1177/0893318914527000}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) The Montréal School, (2) the McPhee's Four Flows based on Gidden's [[Structuration theory|Structuration Theory]], and (3), Luhmann's Theory of [[Social system|Social Systems]].

==McPhee &amp; Zaug's Four Flows==

In their seminal 2000 article, which was republished in 2009 &lt;ref name="McPheeZaug-21-45"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McPhee|first=Robert D|author2=Pamela Zaug|title=The communicative constitution of organizations: A framework for explanation|journal=Building Theories of Organization: The Constitutive Role of Communication.|year=2000|pages=21–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Communicative Constitution of Organizations: A Framework for Explanation'', Robert D. McPhee and Pamela Zaug distinguish four types of communicative flows generate a social structure through interaction. The flows, though distinct, can affect one another in the model and lead to multi-way conversation or texts typically involving reproduction of as well as resistance to the rules and resources of the organization.

[[File:ConstitutiveRoleofComm.jpg|thumb|Model of the four flows or interaction processes which constitute an organization.]]

=== Organizational self-structuring ===

Reflexive self-structuring separates organizations from other groupings such as a [[crowd]] or mob. The self-structuring process is deliberately carried out through communication among role-holders and groups. Communication regarding self-structuring is recursive and [[dialogic]] in nature. It concerns the control, design, and documentation of an organization's relations, [[Norm (social)|norms]], processes, and entities. Communication of formal structure predetermines work routines rather than allowing them to emerge and controls the collaboration and membership-negotiation processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McPhee|first=Robert|title=Organizational communication: Traditional themes and new directions|year=1985|publisher=Sage|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=149–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical examples of organizational self-structuring include a [[charter]], [[organizational chart]], and policy [[Business and company operating manual|manual]].

Organizational self-structuring is a political, subjective process that can be affected by systems, individuals, interests, and traditions in which it takes place.&lt;ref name="McPheeZaug-1-16"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McPhee|first=Robert D|author2=Pamela Zaug|year=2000|title=The communicative constitution of organizations: A framework for explanation|url=http://www.cios.org/EJCPUBLIC/010/1/01017.html|journal=Electronic Journal of Communication/La Revue Electronique de Communication.|volume=10|issue=1-2|pages=1–16}} Reprinted in: {{cite book|title=Building Theories of Organization: The Constitutive Role of Communication.|last=Putnam|first=Linda L|author2=Anne M Nicotera|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=978-0805847109|location=New York|pages=21–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not necessarily free of error or ambiguity. To constitute an organization, the communication must imply the formation and governance of a differentiated whole with its own reflexive response cycle and mechanisms.

=== Membership negotiation ===

Organizations are necessarily composed of, yet are distinct from, individual members. Because humans are not inherently members of organizations, negotiatory communication must occur to incorporate them. Membership negotiation links an [[organization]] to its members by establishing and maintaining relationships. Practices in membership negotiation include job [[recruitment]] and socialization.&lt;ref name="McPheeZaug-1-16" /&gt; In recruitment, potential members are evaluated, both parties must agree to a relationship, and the member must be incorporated into the structure of the organization. The negotiation process can be influenced by powers including prior existence and supervision, and all parties involved may redefine themselves to fit expectations. Among higher status members, power-claiming and spokesmanship are examples of negotiation processes to gain resources of an organization.

=== Activity coordination ===

Activity coordination is a result of the fact that organizations inherently have at least one purpose to which the members' activity is contributing. Often an organization's self-structuring defines the division of labor, work flow sequences, policies, etc. that set the course for activity coordination. The structure is reflexively changing and may not be complete, relevant, fully understood, or free of problems. Therefore, a necessity of communication arises among members to amend and adjust the work process. Activity coordination can include adjusting the work process and resolving immediate or unforeseen practical problems.

Activity coordination operates on the assumption that members are working in an interdependent social unit beyond the work tasks themselves. It incorporates any processes and attitudes and therefore includes coordination for members to not complete work or to seek power over one another. The work of [[Henry Mintzberg|Dr. Henry Mintzberg]] exemplifies activity coordination in the mechanism of mutual adjustment in his theory of organizational forms. In this example, co-workers informally coordinate work arounds for issues on the job.

=== Institutional positioning ===

Institutional positioning links the organization to the environment outside the organization at a macro level. Examples of entities outside the organization include suppliers, customers, and competitors. Communication outside the organization negotiates terms of recognition of the organization’s existence and place in what is called "identity negotiation" or "positioning".&lt;ref name="McPheeZaug-1-16" /&gt; Often the communicators of this message are individuals who concurrently negotiate their own relationships but messages can come from the greater organization as a whole.

Though there is not one configuration that an organization must embody, in order to be considered by peer institutions, the minimum process involves negotiating inclusion in the environment. Organizations must establish and maintain a presence, image, status, and a two-way communication channel with partners. Objects such as organizational charts can assert a particular image and demonstrate legitimacy. Organizations which are marginalized due to their lack of institutional positioning include [[startup companies]] and illegal groups such as [[the Mafia]]. Generally, the more secure an organization, the stronger relationships and control over uncertainty and resources it has in its environment. Pre-existing institutional ([[corporations]], agencies), political, legal, cultural, etc. structures allow for easier constitution of complex organizations.

One of the most distinctive stances of the Montreal School approach, birthed in the Universite de Montreal by James Taylor, Francois Cooren (see particularly Cooren, 2004), and Bruno Latour amongst others, is that texts have agency. Texts do something to humans that is not reducible to certain human interactions and human actions.&lt;ref&gt;Cooren, F. (2004). Textual Agency: How Texts Do Tings in Organizational Settings. Organization, 11, pp. 373-393. DOI 10.1177/1350508404041998&lt;/ref&gt;

The Montreal flavor of CCO is exemplified by Taylor et al. (1996) &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Taylor, J. R., Cooren, F., Giroux, N., &amp; Robichaud, D. (1996). The communicational basis of organization: Between the conversation and the text. Communication theory, 6(1), 1-39.&lt;/ref&gt; and the volume edited by Cooren, Taylor, and Van Emery (2006).&lt;ref&gt;Cooren F., Taylor J. R., Van Emery E. J. (2006). Communication as organizing: Empirical and theoretical exploration in the dynamic of text and conversation. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; The Montréal school foregrounds process of coorientation, or the orientation of two individuals to one another, and the object of conversation. Cooren, Kuhn, Cornelissen, and Clark (2011) &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Cooren F., Kuhn T., Cornelissen J. P., Clark T. (2011). Communication, organizing, and organization: An overview and introduction to the special issue. Organization Studies, 32, 1149-1170.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that coorientation occurs when individuals focus on each other and the multitudes of agencies within the organizational environment. Cooren et al. (2011), the current leading voice in the Montréal school, suggests that Greimas language theory (described by Cooren &amp; Taylor, 2006 as almost incomprehensible) and Latour’s (1995, 2005) Actor Network Theory are the basis of the Montréal school’s thinking. Taylor and Van Every (2001) rely on Austin’s (1962) and Searle’s (1975) Speech Act Theory.

Two central terms to the Montréal school are derived from Austin’s work on language: text and conversation. The text represents big ‘D’ Discourse in the organization, or the way people talk, while conversation represents the messages exchanged between two parties that solidify into text. In this way, Taylor et al. (1996) claim that organizations are not real in the material sense; instead, organizations are a culmination of conversations and texts. Further, Taylor et al. (1996) suggest that organizations always speak through an agent. Over the course of time, distanciation, or solidification of various texts lead to what laypeople refer to as the organization, occurs.

Taylor et al. (1996) propose several degrees of separation between text and conversation. First, text is translated into action through the ability of communication to carry intention. Second, conversation turns into a narrative representation as interlocutors agree on meaning. Third, text is translating into (semi)permanent medium; for example, we write down regulations in an employee handbook. Such medium permits storage of texts to help them become conversation. Fourth, these media specialize the language as professionalism. Fifth, physical and material structures are created by the organization to perpetuate conversation. Finally, publication, dissemination, diffusion, and other forms of broadcast are employed to convey the message created by members of the organization. Through this CCO process, the social arrangements of the workplace become codified. The Montréal school’s proponents contend that the essence of organizing is captured in the submission, imbrication, and embeddedness of text and conversation (Schoeneborn et al., 2014).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Schoeneborn, D., Blaschke, S., Cooren, F., McPhee, R. D., Seidl, D., &amp; Taylor, J. R. (2014). The three schools of CCO thinking: Interactive dialogue and systematic comparison. Management Communication Quarterly, 28(2), 285-316.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other key terms are related with the Montréal school: coorientation (Taylor, 2009),&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, James R.
2009 Organizing from the bottom up? Reflections on the constitution of organization in communication in Building theories of organization: The constitutive role of communication. L. L. Putnam and A.

R., Van Every E. J. (Eds.), Communication as organizing: Empirical and theoretical explorations in the dynamic of text and conversations (pp. 81-100). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; closure (Cooren &amp; Fairhurst, 2004),&lt;ref&gt;Cooren, F., &amp; Fairhurst, G. T. (2004). Speech timing and spacing: The phenomenon of organizational closure. Organization, 11(6), 793-824.&lt;/ref&gt; hybridity (Castor &amp; Cooren, 2006), imbrication (Taylor, 2011),&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, J. R. (2011). Organization as an (imbricated) configuring of transactions. Organization Studies, 32(9), 1273-1294.&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently ventriloquism (Cooren et al. 2013). Coorientation, as described above is an A-B-X relationship between two actors and an object; the object can be psychological, physical, or social. A plenum of agencies refers to the potential of both human and non-human actants (a term borrowed from Actor Network Theory; Latour, 1995) to interact within the organizational environment. Closure is the punctuation of conversations to provide deeper understanding by interlocutors. Hybridity refers to human and nonhuman actants working together to co-orient a claim. Imbrication refers to the emerging structures created by discourse in the organization over time that become an unquestioned part of what we call the organization. Finally, ventriloquism is the study of how interacts (both human and non-human) position and are positioned by the need to act via different values, principles, interests, norms, experiences, and other structures.

== Luhmann's Social Systems ==
Luhmann's systems theory focuses on three topics, which are interconnected in his entire work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schoeneborn|first=Dennis|date=2011-05-19|title=Organization as Communication|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0893318911405622|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=663–689|doi=10.1177/0893318911405622|issn=0893-3189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Systems theory as societal theory
# Communication theory and
# Evolution theory
 
The core element of Luhmann's theory is communication. Social systems are systems of communication, and society is the most encompassing social system. Being the social system that comprises all (and only) communication, today's society is a world society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A system is defined by a boundary between itself and its environment, dividing it from an infinitely complex, or (colloquially) chaotic, exterior. The interior of the system is thus a zone of reduced complexity: Communication within a system operates by selecting only a limited amount of all information available outside. This process is also called "reduction of complexity". The criterion according to which information is selected and processed is meaning (in German, Sinn). Both social systems and psychical or personal systems (see below for an explanation of this distinction) operate by processing meaning.

The third strand of CCO was first acknowledged by Taylor (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, L. L., Phillips, N., &amp; Chapman, P. (1996). Metaphors of communication and organizations. In S. R. Clegg, &amp; W. R. Nord (Eds''.'')'', Handbook of organization studies'' (pp. 375-408). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. &lt;/ref&gt; but has only recently been included as a strand of CCO theorizing&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Luhmann (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. (1995). ''Social systems''. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press. &lt;/ref&gt; claims that individuals do not create meaning, instead all meaning comes from social systems. Perhaps this is why Luhmann’s general system perspective has only recently been considered a part of the CCO body of scholarship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Luhmann takes care to define communication as a tripartite conceptualization of interactive forces. Specifically, Seidl (2014)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; explains that Luhmann suggests communication is an amalgam of information, utterance, and understanding. Whereas information is what is contained in a message, utterance is how the communication is conducted, and understanding “refers to the distinction between information and utterance” (p.&amp;nbsp;290). Luhmann’s perspective is a radical departure from traditional communication scholarship. Putnam and Fairhurst (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Linda L.|last2=Fairhurst|first2=Gail T.|date=2015-10-21|title=Revisiting “Organizations as Discursive Constructions”: 10 Years Later|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/comt.12074|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=375–392|doi=10.1111/comt.12074|issn=1050-3293}}&lt;/ref&gt; explain that the Luhmannian perspective is wholly communicative; that is, meaning is complete up to utterances in a given communicative interaction.

Luhmann’s perspective gives less value to human agency in favor of a social agentic perspective. For this reason, Seidl claims that CCO research using Luhmann’s version should focus on communication not on actors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Human agency is minimized by this perspective. Psychic systems (i.e., the mind) interact with social systems (i.e., an organic conglomerate of multiple psychic systems) and human actors are not relevant to the constitution of organizations.&lt;ref name="Schools" /&gt;

The ''' ''Earth Negotiations Bulletin'' ''' ''('''ENB''')'' is a periodic internet news publication covering negotiations, workshops and conferences on a variety of subjects in environmental policy and international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chasek|first1=Pamela S.|title=NGOs and State Capacity in International Environmental Negotiations: The Experience of the Earth Negotiations Bulletin|journal=Review of European Community and International Environmental Law|volume=10|issue=2|year=2001|pages=168–176|issn=0962-8797|doi=10.1111/1467-9388.00273}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published daily in print and online forms, and with email, Facebook and Twitter feeds, during [[conference of the parties|conferences of the parties]] to [[multilateral environmental agreement]]s; and is a publication of the Reporting Services division of the [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]]. The publication and division are based in New York City.

== History ==

During the 1992 [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in Rio de Janeiro, a small group of environmental journalists published a daily bulletin describing the proceedings. The publication caught the attention of the International Institute for Sustainable Development, a sustainability think tank based in Winnipeg, Canada, which proposed that a team be assembled to provide ongoing coverage of follow-up meetings and processes launched in Rio.

== Personnel ==
Bulletins for each workshop or conference are written and edited by a small team of consultants selected from several dozen located around the world, drawn primarily from academia and international affairs.  Many writers join the team while in graduate school and eventually move on to careers in international organizations.  Conversely, retired career diplomats from the United States, Russia and China have also brought their experience to the team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisd.ca/about/team/ Current ENB Team], IISD Reporting Services&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisd.ca/about/team/former-enb.html Former ENB Team], IISD Reporting Services&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coverage ==

The ''ENB'' covers a range of topics in sustainability.  Core coverage areas include:

* [[Sustainable Development]], including the [[Commission on Sustainable Development]]
* [[Biodiversity]] and [[Wildlife]], including the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], [[Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]], [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]], [[Convention on Migratory Species]], and [[Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services]] (formerly the [[International Mechanism of Scientific Expertise on Biodiversity]])
* Chemicals Management, including the [[Basel Convention]], [[Rotterdam Convention]] and [[Stockholm Convention]]
* [[Climate]] and [[Atmosphere]], including the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], and [[Montreal Protocol]]
* [[Forests]], [[Deserts]] and [[Land (disambiguation)|Land]], including the [[United Nations Forum on Forests]], [[International Tropical Timber Organization]] Council, and [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] Committee on Forestry
* [[Developmental psychology|Human Development]], including [[UN-HABITAT]]
* [[Organizations]], including the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]
* Trade and Investment, including the [[Global Environment Facility]]
* [[Water]], [[Oceans]] and [[Wetlands]], including the [[World Water Forum]], [[Global Conference on Oceans, Coasts and Islands]], the Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]], the [[Straddling Fish Stocks Agreement]], the Working Group on Marine Biodiversity Beyond Areas of National Jurisdiction, and the [[Ramsar Convention on Wetlands]].

Reporting teams are also sent to a variety of conferences on sustainability that fall outside the confines of the list above, under agreements with conference organizers.  These conferences include regional negotiations, conferences dealing with sustainability in specific industries such as the [[International Hydropower Association]] World Congress on Sustainable Hydropower, and special-interest days within larger conferences, such as "Business Day" during UN Climate Change conferences.

In [[differential geometry]], the '''equivalent latitude''' is a [[Lagrangian coordinates|Lagrangian coordinate]] .
It is often used in [[atmospheric science]],
particularly in the study of [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] dynamics.
Each isoline in a map of equivalent latitude follows the [[flow velocity]] and encloses the same area as the latitude line of equivalent value, hence "equivalent latitude."  
Equivalent latitude is calculated from [[potential vorticity]],  from passive tracer simulations  and from actual measurements of atmospheric tracers such as [[ozone]].

==Calculation of equivalent latitude==

The calculation of equivalent latitude involves creating a [[monotonic function|
monotonic mapping]] between the values of equivalent latitude and
the tracer it is based upon: higher values of the tracer map to higher
values of equivalent latitude.
A precise method is to assign a
representative area to each of the tracer measurements, filling the entire globe.
Thus, for a tracer field regularly gridded in longitude and latitude, 
grid points closer to the pole will take up a smaller area,
in proportion to the cosine of the latitude.
Now, [[sorting|rank]] all the tracer values then form the cumulative sum.
The equivalent latitude from the area is given as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\phi = \sin^{-1} \left ( \frac{A}{2 \pi R^2} -1 \right )
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the area enclosed to the South (''A'' = 0 corresponds to the equivalent South Pole) and ''R'' is the radius of the Earth.
This method generates a mapping that is as continuous as the data allows
as opposed to binning which produces a coarse-grained mapping.

{{Anthropology of art}}
{{Anthropology |social/cultural}}

'''Ethnomusicology''' is the study of music from the cultural and social aspects of the people who make it. It encompasses distinct theoretical and methodical approaches that emphasize cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts of musical behavior, instead of only its isolated sound component.

[[Folklore studies|Folklorists]], who began preserving and studying [[folklore]] music in Europe and the US in the 19th century, are considered the precursors of the field prior to the Second World War. The term ''ethnomusicology'' is said to have been first coined by [[Jaap Kunst]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ἔθνος (''ethnos'', "nation") and μουσική (''mousike'', "music"),  It is often defined as the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music, or as musical anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Anthony. 1983. ''Why Suyá Sing.'' London: Oxford University Press. Pp. xiii-xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; During its early development from comparative musicology in the 1950s, ethnomusicology was primarily oriented toward non-[[Western world|Western]] music, but for several decades it has included the study of all and any musics of the world (including Western art music and popular music) from anthropological, sociological and intercultural perspectives.&lt;!--[Surplus?:] The territory of the field has changed radically since its beginnings.--&gt; [[Bruno Nettl]] once characterized ethnomusicology as a product of Western thinking, proclaiming that "ethnomusicology as western culture knows it is actually a western phenomenon";&lt;ref name="nettl.1983"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Study of Ethnomusicology |publisher=University of Illinois Press |author=Nettl, Bruno |year=1983 |location=Urbana, Ill. |pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1992, [[Jeff Todd Titon]] described it as the study of "people making music".&lt;ref name="titon.1992"&gt;{{cite book |title=Worlds of Music |publisher=Schirmer |author=Titon, Jeff Todd |year=1992 |location=New York |pages=xxi |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Stated broadly, ethnomusicology may be described as a holistic investigation of music in its cultural contexts.&lt;ref name="hood.1969"&gt;See {{cite book | date=1969|article=Ethnomusicology|author=Hood, Mantle|editor=Willi Apel|title=Harvard Dictionary of Music|place=Cambridge, Mass. | publisher=Harvard University Press|edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining aspects of folklore, psychology, cultural anthropology, linguistics, comparative musicology, music theory, and history,&lt;ref&gt;McCollum, Jonathan and Hebert, David, Eds., (2014). ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology'' Lanham, MD: Rowman&amp;Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; ethnomusicology has adopted perspectives from a multitude of disciplines.&lt;ref name="newgrove.2001"&gt;{{cite book | article=Ethnomusicology | title=New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians | author=Pegg, Carole (et al) | editor=Sadie, Stanley | year=2001 | edition=2nd | pages=8:367–403 | publisher=Macmillan | place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disciplinary variety has given rise to many definitions of the field, and attitudes and foci of ethnomusicologists have evolved since initial studies in the area of comparative musicology in the early 1900s. When the field first came into existence, it was largely limited to the study of non-Western music—in contrast to the study of Western art music, which had been the focus of conventional musicology. In fact, the field was referred to early in its existence as “comparative musicology,” defining Western musical traditions as the standard to which all other musics were compared, though this term fell out of use in the 1950s as critics for the practices associated with it became more vocal about ethnomusicology's distinction from musicology.&lt;ref name="Nettl, Bruno 2005"&gt;Nettl, Bruno. "The Harmless Drudge: Defining Ethnomusicology.” ''The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-one Issues and Concepts''. Urbana: University of Illinois, 2005. 3-15. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the definition broadened to include study of all the musics of the world according to certain ''approaches''.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Helen. 1992.  “Ethnomusicology.”  In Ethnomusicology: An Introduction, ed. Helen Myers, 3-18. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam, Alan 1960"&gt;Merriam, Alan. 1960. “Ethnomusicology: A Discussion and Definition of the Field.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 4(3): 107-114.&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is not a single, authoritative definition for ethnomusicology, a number of constants appear in the definitions employed by leading scholars in the field. It is agreed upon that ethnomusicologists look at music from beyond a purely sonic and historical perspective, and look instead at music within culture, music as culture, and music as a reflection of culture.&lt;ref name="Nettl, Bruno 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam, Alan 1960"/&gt; In addition, many ethnomusicological studies share common methodological approaches encapsulated in [[ethnography|ethnographic]] [[fieldwork]], often conducting primary fieldwork among those who make the music, learning languages and the music itself, and taking on the role of a participant observer in learning to perform in a musical tradition, a practice Hood termed "bi-musicality".&lt;ref name="hood.bimusicality"/&gt; Musical fieldworkers often also collect recordings and contextual information about the music of interest.&lt;ref name="Nettl, Bruno 2005"/&gt; Thus, ethnomusicological studies do not rely on printed or manuscript sources as the primary source of epistemic authority.

==History==
While the traditional subject of [[musicology]] has been the history and literature of Western [[art music]], ''ethnomusicology'' was developed as the study of all music as a human social and cultural phenomenon. [[Oskar Kolberg]] is regarded{{By whom|date=September 2018}} as one of the earliest European ethnomusicologists as he first began collecting Polish folk songs in 1839. Comparative musicology, the primary precursor to ethnomusicology, emerged in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The International Musical Society in Berlin in 1899 acted as one of the first centers for ethnomusicology.{{Cn|date=September 2018}} Comparative musicology and early ethnomusicology tended to focus on non-Western music, but in more recent years, the field has expanded to embrace the study of Western music from an [[ethnographic]] standpoint.

The [[International Council for Traditional Music]] (founded 1947) and the [[Society for Ethnomusicology]] (founded 1955) are the primary international academic organizations for advancing the discipline of ethnomusicology.

Ethnomusicologists have offered varying definitions of the field. More specifically, scholars debate what constitutes ethnomusicology. Bruno Nettl distinguishes between discipline and field, believing ethnomusicology is the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 1975. “The State of Research in Ethnomusicology, and Recent Developments.” Current Musicology 20: 67-78.&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple approaches to and challenges of the field. Some approaches reference "musical areas" like "musical synthesis in Ghana" while others emphasize "a study of culture through the avenue of music, to study music as social behavior."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;McAllester, David et. al. 1959. “Whither Ethnomusicology?” ''Ethnomusicology'' 3(2): 99-105.&lt;/ref&gt; The multifaceted and dynamic approaches to ethnomusicology allude to how the field has evolved. The primary element that distinguishes ethnomusicology from musicology is the expectation that ethnomusicologists engage in sustained, diachronic fieldwork as their primary source of data.{{Cn|date=September 2018}}

There are many individuals and groups who can be connected to ethnomusicology. According to Merriam, some of these groups are "players of ethnic music," "music educators," "those who see ethnic music in the context of a global view of music, vis a vis, particularly, the study of Western "classical" music," "made up of persons with a variety of interests, all of which are in some sense "applied" like "professional ethnomusicologists," music therapists, the "musicologists" and the "anthropologist."&lt;ref&gt;Merriam, Alan P. 1975. “Ethnomusicology Today.” Current Musicology 20: 50-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folklore===
{{Main|Folklore|Folklore studies}}
Folklore and Folklorists were the precursors to the field of Ethnomusicology prior to WWII. They laid a foundation of interest in the preservation and continuation of the traditional folk musics of nations and an interest in the differences between the musics of various nations. Folklorists approached folklore through comparative methods; these methods sought to prove that folk music was simple but reflected the lives of the lower classes.

Folklore is defined as “traditional customs, tales, sayings, dances, or art forms preserved among a people.” &lt;ref&gt;Folklore [Def. 1]. (n.d.). In Merriam-Webster Online. Retrieved December 13, 2017, from https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/folklore.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Nettl, an ethnomusicologist, defines folk music as “…the music in oral tradition found in those areas dominated by high cultures.”&lt;ref name="Pegg, Carole p V"&gt;Pegg, Carole, Helen Myers, Philip V. Bohlman, and Martin Stokes. 2001. “Ethnomusicology.” In The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, vol. 8, ed. S. Sadie, 367-403. London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition can be simplified as the traditional music of a certain people within a country or region.

Nationalism and the search for national identities was tied into folkloric studies. Southern and Eastern European composers incorporated folk music into their compositions to instill sentiments of nationalism in their audiences. Examples of such composers are Leoš Janáček, Edvard Grieg, Jean Sibelius, Béla Bartók, and Nikolai Rimsy-Korsakov. As Helen Meyers puts it, “Nationalist composers throughout Europe turned to peasant song to enrich the classical musical idiom of their country.”&lt;ref name="Myers, Helen 1992"&gt;Myers, Helen. 1992. “Ethnomusicology.” In Ethnomusicology: An Introduction, ed. Helen Myers, 3-18. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the preservation of folk music was a search for a sense of national tradition in the face of striking regional diversity.&lt;ref name="Myers, Helen 1992"/&gt;

“The collecting projects of southern and eastern Europeans of the second half of the 19th century were largely contributions to folkloric studies. These collectors feared that entire repertories were on the point of extinction, repertories that were thought a proper base for nationalist styles of art music. Early collectors were motivated by musical nationalism, theories of self-determination, and by hope for a musical rationale for a pan-Slavic identity…eastern Europeans explored their own linguistic setting, amassing large collections, thousands of song texts and, later, tunes, which they sought to classify and compare.”&lt;ref name="Pegg, Carole p V"/&gt; The most well-known eastern European collectors were Béla Bartók (Hungary), [[Constantin Brăiloiu]] (Romania), [[Klyment Kvitka|Klement Kvitka]] (Ukraine), [[Adolf Chybiński|Adolf Chybinski]] (Poland), and [[Vasil Stoin]] (Bulgaria).&lt;ref name="Pegg, Carole p V"/&gt;

In 1931, Béla Bartók published an essay detailing his study of what he refers to as “Peasant music” which “…connotes…all the tunes which endure among the peasant class of any nation, in a more or less wide area and for a more or less long period, and constitute a spontaneous expression of the musical feeling of that class.”&lt;ref&gt;Bartok, Bela. 1931. Hungarian Folk Music. London: Oxford University Press. Pp. 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Bartok takes a comparative approach in his investigation of Hungarian folk music and believes that peasant music is primitive when compared to the music of the educated class.

In North America, state folklore societies were founded in the early 20th century and were dedicated to the collection and preservation of Old World ''folksong'', i.e. music that came from Europe, Africa, or places outside of the U.S. during the settlement of the U.S. by colonizers; Native American music was also included in these societies. “In 1914 the US Department of Education instigated a rescue mission for ballads and folksongs, stimulating an era of collecting by local enthusiasts and academics that lasted through the Depression until World War II.”&lt;ref name="Pegg, Carole p V"/&gt;
[[Cecil Sharp]], a lawyer turned musician, greatly contributed to the collection and preservation of British folk songs found in Appalachia. His interest in folk music began in 1903, when he discovered that a large amount of native folk song survived in England and published Folk Songs from Somerset (1904–1909). After he studied traditional English folk song in England, he traveled to the Appalachia region with his collaborator [[Maud Karpeles]] of the United States of America 3 times between the years 1916 and 1918 and discovered around 1,600 English tunes and variants.&lt;ref name="Myers, Helen 1992"/&gt;
In 1909 [[Olive Dame Campbell]] traveled to the Appalachia region of the U.S. from Massachusetts and discovered that the ballads sung by the residents had strong ties to English and Scots-Irish folk songs. She collected ballads by having people sing them to her while she recorded them on a phonograph and transcribed them. She worked with Cecil Sharp and published the ballads that she had collected in English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians.
The Appalachia region of the United States preserved old English and Scots-Irish folk songs because it was isolated from the city centers of the original thirteen colonies.{{Cn|date=September 2018}}

A controversy in the field of musicology arose surrounding ''[[Spiritual (music)|Negro Spirituals]]''. A musical spiritual is defined as “a religious song usually of a deeply emotional character that was developed especially among blacks in the southern U.S.”&lt;ref&gt;Spiritual [Entry 2 Def. 2]. (n.d.). In Merriam-Webster Online. Retrieved December 13, 2017, from https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spiritual.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy revolved around whether the spirituals originated solely from Africa or if they were influenced by European music. Richard Wallaschek claimed that Negro Spirituals were merely imitations of European song, starting the debate on the subject. Erich von Hornbostel concluded that African and European musics were constructed on different principles and therefore could not be combined. The white origin theory argued that black music had been influenced by Anglo-American song and constituted an integral part of the British Tradition. Melville J. Herskovits and his student Richard A. Waterman discovered that “European and African forms had blended to produce new genres bearing features of both parent musics. European and African music…have many features in common, among them diatonic scales and polyphony. When these two musics met, during the slave era, it was natural for them to blend…”&lt;ref name="Pegg, Carole p V"/&gt; ''Negro Spirituals'' were the first black musical genre comprehensively studied by scholars.{{Cn|date=September 2018}}

The interest in folklore did not end with the folklorists before World War II. After World War II, the International Folk Music Council was founded and was later renamed the International Council for Traditional Music.&lt;ref name="Pegg, Carole p V"/&gt; In 1978, [[Alan Lomax]] sought to classify and compare the music of world cultures through a system he named [[Cantometrics]].&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, Alan. 1978 [1968]. Folk Song Style and Culture. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Books.&lt;/ref&gt; This goal began with his idea that singing is a universal characteristic and therefore all musics of the world should have some comparable characteristics. Lomax believed that human migration could be tracked through songs; when a certain culture's song or style is heard in another geographical region, it signifies that the two cultures interacted at some point. Lomax believes that song styles vary with productive range, political level, level of stratification of class, severity of sexual mores, balance of dominance between male and female, and the level of social cohesiveness. Lomax believed that all musics could be compared through the use these seven categories. He compared vocal performances through a set of characteristics, some of which are ‘raspiness’, the use of meaningful words, and the use of meaningful syllables.

===Comparative Musicology===
Comparative musicology is known as the cross-cultural study of music.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;''Comparative Musicology''. www.compmus.org/. Accessed 13 Dec. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Once referred to as “Musikologie”, comparative musicology emerged in the late 19th century in response to the works of [[Komitas]] Keworkian (also known as Komitas Vardapet or Soghomon Soghomonian.)&lt;ref&gt;Poladian, Sirvart. 1972 “Komitas Vardapet and His Contribution to Ethnomusicology.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 16(1): 82&lt;/ref&gt;  A precedent to modern ethnomusicological studies, comparative musicology seeks to look at music throughout world cultures and their respective histories. Similarly to comparative linguistics, comparative musicology seeks to classify music of global cultures, illustrate their geographic distribution, explain universal musical trends, and understand the causation concerning the creation and evolution of music.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Developed throughout the early 20th century, the term “comparative musicology” emerged in an 1885 publication by [[Guido Adler]], who added the term “comparative” to musicology to describe works by scholars such as Alexander J. Ellis, whose academic process was founded in cross-cultural comparative studies.&lt;ref&gt;Seel, Norbert M. “Comparative Musicology to Ethnomusicology.” 2011 ''Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning'' 1632&lt;/ref&gt; As one of four subdivisions of systematic musicology, “comparative musicology” was once described by Adler himself as the task of “comparing tonal products, in particular the folk songs of various peoples, countries, and territories, with an ethnographic purpose in mind, grouping and ordering these according to…their characteristics”.&lt;ref&gt;Mugglestone, Erica and Guido Adler. 1981. “Guido Adler’s ‘The Scope, Method, and Aim of Musicology’ (1885): An English Translation with an Historico-Analytical Commentary.” ''Yearbook for Traditional Music'' 13: 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative musicology is typically thought to have been inspired by the work of [[Komitas Vardapet]], an Armenian priest, musicology and choirmaster, who began his work studying in Berlin. His work primarily focused on the transcription of nearly 4000 pieces of Armenian, Turkish, and Kurdish folk music.&lt;ref&gt;Poladian, Sirvart. 1972 “Komitas Vardapet and His Contribution to Ethnomusicology.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 16(1): 84&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts to categorize and classify various music inspired others to do the same. This included [[Guido Adler]], a Bohemian-Austrian musicologist and professor at the [[German University of Prague, Bohemia]], who officially coined the term “vergleichende Musikwissenschaft” (translated: comparative music science) in 1885 in response to the emergence of new academic methods of studying music.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Edward R., and Guido Adler. 2009 ''Gustav Mahler and Guido Adler: records of a friendship''. Cambridge University Press 80&lt;/ref&gt;  Around the same time of Adler's development of the terminology associated with the study, the work of [[Alexander John Ellis|Alexander J. Ellis]], who focused primarily on developing the cents system, was emerging as the foundation of the comparative elements of musicology. This cents system allowed from precise delineation of particular measurements denoted from pitch denoted as “hundredths of an equal-tempered semitone”.&lt;ref&gt;Stock, Jonathan. 2007. “Alexander J. Ellis and His Place in the History of Ethnomusicology.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 51(2): 306-25&lt;/ref&gt;  Ellis also established a general definition for the pitch of a musical note, which he noted as “the number of…complete vibrations…made in each second by a particle of air while the note is heard”.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Alexander J. 1885. “On the Musical Scales of Various Nations.” ''Journal of the Society of Arts'' 33: 485–527.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other contemporaries of Komitas, Ellis, and Adler included [[Erich von Hornbostel]], and [[Carl Stumpf]], who are typically credited with establishing comparative musicology as an official field separate from musicology itself. Von Hornbostel, who once stated that Ellis was the “true founder of comparative scientific musicology.”, was an Austrian scholar of music, while Stumpf was a German philosopher and psychologist.&lt;ref&gt;Stock, Jonathan. 2007. “Alexander J. Ellis and His Place in the History of Ethnomusicology.” ''Ethnomusicology'' p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Otto Abraham, they founded the “Berlin School of Comparative Musicology”.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Dieter. 1991. “Eric M. von Hornbostel, Carl Stumpf, and the Institutionalization of Comparative Musicology.” In ''Comparative Musicology and Anthropology of Music'', ed. B. Nettl and P. Bohlman, 201–209. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite working together, Stumpf and Hornbostel had very different ideas regarding the foundation of the school. As Stumpf focused primarily from a psychological perspective, his position was founded in the belief of “unity of the human mind”; his interests were on sensual experiences of tones and intervals and their respective ordering. In addition, his studies focused on testing his hypothesis of perceived fusion of tones.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Dieter. 1991. “Eric M. von Hornbostel, Carl Stumpf, and the Institutionalization of Comparative Musicology.” In ''Comparative Musicology and Anthropology of Music'', ed. B. Nettl and P. Bohlman, 201–209. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Hornbostel adopted Stumpf's assignment, but rather approached the topic from his systematic and theoretical perspective, and did not concern himself with others. Through the institution, additional scholars such as [[Curt Sachs]], Mieczyslaw Kolinski, George Herzog and [[Jaap Kunst]] (who first coined the term “ethno-musicology” in a 1950 article) further expanded the field of comparative musicology. Additionally Hungarian composer [[Béla Bartók]] was conducting his own comparative studies at the time, focusing primarily on Hungarian (and other) folk music, in addition to the influence of European popular music on musical folk-lore of that particular geographic region.&lt;ref&gt;Bartok, Bela. 1931. ''Hungarian Folk Music.'' London: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, comparative musicology began experiencing changes. Following the [[World War II|Second World War]], issues regarding the ethical contexts of comparative musicology began to emerge. As comparative musicology was founded primarily in Europe, most scholars based their comparisons in Western music. In an effort to adjust the Western bias present in their studies, academics such as Jaap Kunst began adjusting their approaches in analysis and fieldwork to become more globally focused.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam, Alan P. 1977 “Definitions of "Comparative Musicology" and "Ethnomusicology": An Historical-Theoretical Perspective.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 21(2)'':'' 189&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, comparative musicology continued to evolve to become ethnomusicology, but still remains today a field focused primarily on comparative studies in music.

===Beginnings and early history===
Ethnomusicology has evolved both in terminology and ideology since its formal inception in the late 19th century. Although practices paralleling ethnomusicological work have been noted throughout colonial history, an Armenian priest known as [[Komitas]] Vardapet is considered one of the pioneers to ethnomusicology's rise to prominence in 1896. While studying in Berlin at Frederick William University and attending the International Music Society, Vardapet transcribed over 3000 pieces of music. In his notes, he emphasized cultural and religious elements as well as social aspects of music and poetry. Inspired by these thoughts, many Western European nations began to transcribe and categorize music based on ethnicity and culture. Inspired by these thoughts, many Western European nations began to put many ethnic and cultural pieces of music onto paper and separate them. It was known very briefly in the 1880s as "Musikologie” or "Musikgesellschaft," then “comparative musicology” until around 1950, at which point the term “ethno-musicology” was introduced to provide an alternative term to the traditional practices of comparative musicology. In 1956  the hyphen was removed with ideological intent to signify the discipline's validity and independence from the fields of musicology and anthropology. These changes to the field's name paralleled its internal shifts in ideological and intellectual emphasis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Nettl, Bruno. "The Harmless Drudge: Defining Ethnomusicology." ''The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-one Issues and Concepts.'' Urbana: U of Illinois, 2005. 3-5. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative musicology, an initial term intended to differentiate what would become ethnomusicology and musicology, was the area of study concerned with utilizing methods of acoustics to measure pitches and intervals, quantitatively comparing different kinds of music.&lt;ref name="Merriam, Alan P 1977"&gt;Merriam, Alan P. "Definitions of "Comparative Musicology" and "Ethnomusicology: An Historical-Theoretical Perspective." ''Ethnomusicology,'' 21.2 (1977): 189. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the high density of Europeans and Euro-Americans engaged with the area's research, comparative musicology primarily surveyed the music of non-Western oral folk traditions and then compared them against western conceptions of music.&lt;ref name="Merriam, Alan P 1975"&gt;Merriam, Alan P. 1975. “Ethnomusicology Today.” ''Current Musicology'' 20: 50-54.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1950, scholars sought to define the field more broadly and to eradicate these notions of ethnocentrism inherent to the study of comparative musicology; for example, Polish scholar Mieczyslaw Kolinski proposed that scholars in the field focus on describing and understanding musics within their own contexts.&lt;ref name="Merriam, Alan P 1977"/&gt; Kolinski also urged the field to move beyond ethnocentrism even as the term ethnomusicology grew in popularity as a replacement for what was once described by comparative musicology. He noted in 1959 that the term ethnomusicology limited the field, both by imposing “foreignness” from a western standpoint and therefore excluding the study of western music with the same attention to cultural context that is given to otherized traditions, and by containing the field within anthropological problems rather than extending musical study to limitless disciplines within the humanities and the social sciences.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Throughout critical developmental years in the 50s and 60s, ethnomusicologists shaped and legitimized the fledgling field through discussions of the responsibilities of ethnomusicologists and the ethical implications of ethnomusicological study, articulations of ideology, suggestions for practical methods of research and analysis, and definitions of music itself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It was also at this time that the emphasis of ethnomusicological work shifted from analysis to fieldwork, and the field began to develop research methods to center fieldwork over the traditional "armchair" work.

In 1960, [[Mantle Hood]] established the Institute of Ethnomusicology at the University of California at Los Angeles, largely legitimizing the field and solidifying its position as an academic discipline.{{Cn|date=September 2018}}

===1970s===
In the 1970s, ethnomusicology was becoming more well known outside of the small circle of scholars who had founded and fostered the early development of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam, Alan P. 1975. “Ethnomusicology Today.” ''Current Musicology'' 20: 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of ethnomusicology spread to composers, music therapists, music educators, anthropologists, musicologists, and even popular culture.&lt;ref name="Ethnomusicology Library excerpt"&gt;{{cite episode | title=Ethnomusicology Library (excerpt) | series=Sanford and Son | airdate=1973 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghY5oMEBaEc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnomusicology and its academic rigor lent newfound legitimacy, as well as useful theoretical and methodological frameworks, to projects that attempted to record, document, study, and/or compare musics from around the world. [[Alan Merriam]] classified these ethnomusicological participants in four groups:&lt;ref name="Merriam, Alan P 1975"/&gt;
* 1) Performers of ethnic music, including anyone at all who learns to play an instrument from another culture: This group grew considerably during the 1970s due to increased awareness of and interest in ethnic music, partly assisted by the dissemination of records. These performers range from self-taught amateurs to experienced graduates of university world music programs.
* 2) Teachers, usually primary or secondary, who teach the appreciation and performance of "ethnic" music: This group, along with the first, proliferated rapidly during the 1970s, aided in part by the October 1972 issue of the [[Music Educators Journal]], a special issue entitled ''Music in World Cultures'', which included a bibliography, discography, and filmography to aid teachers of the world's musics. These teachers are not necessarily ethnomusicologists, but are nonetheless advancing some of the aims of the field.
* 3) The musicological contingent: ethnomusicologists who study music in terms of the sound object (this can be in the form of performances, recordings, or transcriptions, and focuses on the pitch, rhythmic, formal, and harmonic content); cultural context, for these ethnomusicologists, assumes a secondary role.
* 4) The anthropological contingent: ethnomusicologists who focus on human beings with the stance that “music is culture” and “what musicians do is society.”

One defining feature of this decade was the advent of anthropological influence within ethnomusicology. During this time, the discipline of ethnomusicology experienced a shift of focus away from musical data, such as pitch and formal structure, toward humans and human relationships. The incorporation of theoretical frameworks from the field of anthropology also led to an increasingly welcoming attitude towards accepting yet more fields of study, such as linguistics and psychology, into the broader pursuit of understanding music as it functions in (or "as") culture.

Throughout this decade, the tensions regarding comparative approaches continued to come into question in ethnomusicological circles. The introduction of [[Alan Lomax]]'s system of cantometrics in the late 60s accounted for physical traits of vocal production like language/utterance, the distinctness of “singing voice” from speaking voice, use of intonation, ornamentation, and pitch, consistency of tempo and volume, and the length of melodic phrases, and also the social elements like the participation of the audience and the way a performance is structured; in this way, it intended to make the data of ethnomusicological research more quantifiable and grant it scientific legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Lomax, Alan Pp. 3-33"&gt;Lomax, Alan. 1978 [1968]. ''Folk Song Style and Culture.'' New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Books. Pp. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the system also legitimized comparative methods, thus extending the debate regarding the ethics of a comparative approach.

===1980s===
The 1980s ushered in a heightened awareness of bias and representation in ethnomusicology, meaning that ethnomusicologists took into consideration the effects of biases they brought to their studies as (usually) outgroup members, as well as the implications of how they choose to represent the ethnography and music of the cultures they study. Historically, Western field workers dubbed themselves experts on foreign music traditions once they felt they had a handle on the music, but these scholars ignored differences in worldview, priority systems, and cognitive patterns, and thought that their interpretation was truth.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. “You Will Never Understand this Music.” ''The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-one Issues and Concepts''. Urbana: University of Illinois, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of research contributed to a larger phenomenon called [[Orientalism]]."

It was also during that time that [[Clifford Geertz]]’s concept of [[thick description]] spread from anthropology to ethnomusicology. In particular, ethnomusicologist [[Timothy Rice]] called for a more human-focused study of ethnomusicology,&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Timothy. 1987. “Toward the Remodeling of Ethnomusicology.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 31(3): 469-516.&lt;/ref&gt; putting emphasis on the processes that bind music and society together in musical creation and performance. His model follows [[Alan P. Merriam|Alan Merriam]]’s identification of the field as "the study of music in culture."&lt;ref&gt;Merriam, Alan. 1964. The Anthropology of Music. Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press. Pp. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Rice puts more focus on historical change as well as the role of the individual in music-making. In particular, Rice's model asks "how do people historically construct, socially maintain and individually create and experience music?"&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Timothy. 1987. “Toward the Remodeling of Ethnomusicology.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 31(3): 473.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to presenting new models of thought, Rice's ideas were also meant to unify the field of ethnomusicology into a more organized, cohesive field by providing an organized series of questions to address in the course of research.&lt;ref&gt;Rice. 1987. “Tim Rice Responds.” ''EM'' 31(3): 515-516.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern that came to the forefront in the 1980s is known as [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]]. The ethnomusicologist and his or her culture of study have a bidirectional, reflexive influence on one another in that it is possible not only for observations to affect the observer, but also for the presence of the observer to affect what they observe.

The awareness of the nature of oral tradition and the problems it poses for reliability of source came into discussion during the 1980s. The meaning of a particular song is in the kind of flux associated with any oral tradition, each successive performer bringing his or her own interpretation. Furthermore, regardless of original intended meaning, once a song is originally interpreted by the audience, recalled later in memory when recounting the performance to a researcher, interpreted by the researcher, and then interpreted by the researcher's audience, it can, and does, take on a variety of different meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Titon, Jeff Todd. 1988. ''Powerhouse for God.'' Austin: University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s can be classified by the emergence of awareness of cultural bias, the reliability of different sources, and a general skepticism as regards the validity of the researcher's point of view and of the object of research itself.

===1990s===
By the late 1980s, the field of ethnomusicology had begun examining [[popular music]] and the effect of media on musics around the world. Several definitions of popular music exist but most agree that it is characterized by having widespread appeal. Peter Manuel adds to this definition by distinguishing popular music by its association with different groups of people, performances by musicians not necessarily trained or intellectual, and dispersion through broadcasting and recording.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel, Peter. 1988. '’Popular Musics of the Non-Western World’’. New York: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Adorno]] defined popular music by contrasting it from serious music, which is purposeful and generally cooperates within strictly structured rules and conventions. Popular music can operate less deliberately and focuses on creating a general effect or impression, usually focusing on emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor. 1990 [1941]. “On Popular Music.” In ‘'On Record: Rock, Pop, and the Written Word’’, ed. S. Frith and A. Goodwin, 301-314. New York: Pantheon Books.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the music industry developed over several decades, popular music drew ethnomusicologists’ attention by the 90s because a standardizing effect began to develop. The corporate nature surrounding popular music streamlined it into a framework that focused on slight deviations from the accepted norm, creating what Adorno calls “pseudo-individualism”; what the public would perceive as unique or organic would musically comply with standard, established musical conventions. Thus, a duality emerged from this standardization, an industry-driven manipulation of the public's tastes to give people what they want while simultaneously guiding them to it. In the case of rock music, while the genre may have grown out of politicized forces and another form of meaningful motivation, the corporate influence over popular music became integral to its identity that directing public taste became increasingly easier.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, Simon. 1981. ‘’Sound Effects: Youth, Leisure, and the Politics of Rock’n’roll’’. New York: Pantheon. Pp. 39-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Technological developments allowed for easy dispersion of western music, causing the dominance of western music into rural and urbanized areas across the globe. However, because popular music assumes such a corporatized role and therefore remains subject to a large degree of standardization, ambiguity exists whether the music reflects actual cultural values or those only of the corporate sector seeking economic profit.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel, Peter. 1988. ‘’Popular Musics of the Non-Western World’’. New York: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt; Because popular music developed such a dependent relationship with media and the corporations surrounding it, where record sales and profit indirectly shaped musical decisions, the superstar person became an important element of popular music. From the fame and economic success surrounding such superstars, subcultures continued to arise, such as the rock and punk movements, only perpetuated by the corporate machine that also shaped the musical aspect of popular music.

Musical interaction through globalization played a huge role in ethnomusicology in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press.  Chapter 30: "A New Era"&lt;/ref&gt; Musical change was increasingly discussed. Ethnomusicologists began looking into a 'global village', straying away from a specialized look at music within a specific culture. There are two sides to this globalization of music: on one hand it would bring more cultural exchange globally, but on the other hand it could facilitate the appropriation and assimilation of musics.  Ethnomusicologists have approached this new combination of different styles of music within one music by looking at the musical complexity and the degree of compatibility.  This Westernization and modernization of music created a new focus of study; ethnomusicologists began to look at how different musics interact in the 1990s.

===2000s===
By the 2000s, musicology (which had previously limited its focus almost exclusively to European art music), began to look more like ethnomusicology, with greater awareness of and consideration for sociocultural contexts and practices beyond analysis of art music compositions and biographical studies of major European composers.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, John. 2003. “Music and Social Categories.” In ''The Cultural Study of Music'', ed. M. Clayton, T. Herbert and R. Middleton, 239-248. New York and London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnomusicologists continued to deal with and consider the effects of globalization on their work. Bruno Nettl identifies Westernization and modernization as two concurrent and similar cultural trends that served to help streamline musical expression all over the world. While creeping globalization had an undeniable effect on cultural homogeneity, it also helped broaden musical horizons all over the world. Rather than simply lamenting the continuing assimilation of folk music of non-western cultures, many ethnomusicologists chose to examine exactly how non-western cultures dealt with the process of incorporating western music into their own practices to facilitate the survival of their previous traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 1975. “The State of Research in Ethnomusicology, and Recent 
Developments.” Current Musicology 20: 67-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the ongoing globalization of music, many genres influenced each other and elements from foreign music became more prevalent in mainstream popular music. Diaspora populations such as the Punjab population in England were studied due to the characteristics of their music showing signs of the effects of global media. Their music, like many other music of displaced cultures, was made up of elements from the folk music of their culture along with the popular music of their location. Through this process the idea of transnationalism in music occurred.&lt;ref name="Schreffler, Gibb 2012"&gt;Schreffler, Gibb. 2012. “Migration Shaping Media: Punjabi Popular Music in a Global Historical Perspective.” ''Popular Music and Society'' 35(3): 333-358.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, postcolonial thought remained a focus of ethnomusicological literature. One example comes from Ghanaian ethnomusicologist Kofi Agawu; in ''Representing African Music: Postcolonial Notes, Queries, Positions'', he details how the concept of “African rhythm” has been misrepresented – “African” music is not a homogenous body as it is often perceived by Western thought. Its differences from Western music are often considered deficiencies,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} and the emphasis on "African rhythm" prevalent throughout music scholarship prevents accurate comparison of other musical elements such as melody and harmony. Influenced by postcolonial thought theories, Agawu focuses on deconstructing the Eurocentric intellectual [[hegemony]] surrounding understanding African music and the notation of the music itself.&lt;ref&gt;Agawu, Kofi. 2003. Representing African Music: Postcolonial Notes, Queries, Positions. 
New York and London: Routledge. Pp.xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the new notational systems that have been developed specifically for African music further prevent accurate comparison due to the impossibility of applying these notations to Western music. Overall, Agawu implores scholars to search for similarities rather than differences in their examinations of African music, as a heightened exploration of similarities would be much more empowering and intellectually satisfying.&lt;ref&gt;Agawu, Kofi. 2003. Representing African Music: Postcolonial Notes, Queries, Positions. New York and London: Routledge. Pp.67-68&lt;/ref&gt; This means by reexamining the role of European (through [[colonialism]] and [[imperialism]]) and other cultural influences have had on the history of "African" music as individual nations, tribes, and collectively as a continent.&lt;ref&gt;Agawu, Kofi. 2003. Representing African Music: Postcolonial Notes, Queries, Positions. 
New York and London: Routledge. Pp.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on difference within music scholarship has led to the creation of "default grouping mechanisms" that inaccurately convey the music of Africa, such as claims that polymeter, additive rhythm and cross rhythm are prevalent throughout all African music. The actual complexity and sophistication of African music goes unexplored when scholars simply talk about it within these categories and move on. Agawu also calls for the direct empowerment of postcolonial African subjects within music scholarship, in response to attempts to incorporate native discourses into scholarship by Western authors that he believes have led to inaccurate representation and a distortion of native voices. Agawu worries of the possible implementation of the same Western ideals but with an "African" face, "in what we have, rather, are the views of a group of scholars operating within a field of discourse, an intellectual space defined by Euro-American traditions of ordering knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Agawu, Kofi. 2003. Representing African Music: Postcolonial Notes, Queries, Positions. New York and London: Routledge. Pp.58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Agawu, Kofi. 2003. ''Representing African Music: Postcolonial Notes, Queries, Positions.'' New York and London: Routledge. Pp. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, scholarship that may have historically been identified as ethnomusicology is now classified as [[sound studies]].

==In Western popular culture==
Ethnomusicology is not limited to the study of music from non-Western cultures.  It is discipline that encompasses various approaches to the study of the many musics around the world that emphasize their particular dimensions (cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, etc.) and contexts beyond their isolated sound components.  Western music and its influences are thus also subject to ethnomusicological interest.

The influence of the media on consumerism in Western society is a bi-directional effect, according to [[Thomas Turino]].&lt;ref&gt;Turino, Thomas. 2008. Music as Social Life: The Politics of Participation. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press. Pp. 93-121.&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of self-discovery and feeling accepted in social groups is related to common musical tastes.  Record companies and producers of music recognize this reality and respond by catering to specific groups. In the same way that “sounds and imagery piped in over the radio and Internet and in videos shape adolescent sense of gendered selves as well as generational and more specific cohort identities,“ so do individuals shape the media's marketing responses to musical tastes in Western popular music culture.  The culmination of identity groups (teenagers in particular) across the country represents a significant force that can shape the music industry based on what is being consumed.

==Theories and methods==
Ethnomusicologists often apply theories and methods from [[cultural anthropology]], [[cultural studies]] and [[sociology]] as well as other disciplines in the social sciences and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., from anthropology {{citation |author=Turnbull, Colin|title=[[The Forest People]]|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though some ethnomusicologists primarily conduct historical studies, the majority are involved in long-term participant observation. Therefore, ethnomusicological work can be characterized as featuring a substantial, intensive ethnographic component.

===Anthropological and Musicological Approaches ===
Two approaches to ethnomusicological studies are common: the ''anthropological'' and the ''musicological''. Ethnomusicologists using the anthropological approach generally study music to learn about people and culture. Those who practice the musicological approach study people and cultures to learn about music. [[Charles Seeger]] differentiated between the two approaches, describing the anthropology of music as studying the way that music is a “part of culture and social life”, while musical anthropology “studies social life as a performance,” examining the way “music is part of the very construction and interpretation of social and conceptual relationships and processes.” &lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Charles. "Preface." Why Suya Sing. 1983. xiii-xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Seeger]] and [[Mantle Hood]] were two ethnomusicologists that adopted the musicological approach. Hood started one of the first American university programs dedicated to ethnomusicology, often stressing that his students must learn how to play the music they studied. Further, prompted by a college student's personal letter, he recommended that potential students of ethnomusicology undertake substantial musical training in the field, a competency that he described as "bimusicality."&lt;ref name="hood.bimusicality"&gt;{{cite news|author=Hood, Mantle|title=The Challenge of Bi-musicality|journal=Ethnomusicology|volume=4|date=1960|pages=55–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, he explained, is a measure intended to combat ethnocentrism and transcend problematic Western analytical conventions. Seeger also sought to transcend comparative practices by focusing on the music and how it impacted those in contact with it. Similar to Hood, Seeger valued the performance component of ethnomusicology.

Ethnomusicologists following the anthropological approach include scholars such as [[Steven Feld]] and [[Alan Merriam]]. The anthropological ethnomusicologists stress the importance of field work and utilizing [[participant observation]]. This can include a variety of distinct fieldwork practices, including personal exposure to a performance tradition or musical technique, participation in a native ensemble, or inclusion in a myriad of social customs. Similarly, Alan Merriam defined ethnomusicology as “music as culture,” and stated four goals of ethnomusicology: to help protect and explain non-Western music, to save “folk” music before it disappears in the modern world, to study music as a means of communication to further world understanding, and to provide an avenue for wider exploration and reflection for those who are interested in primitive studies.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam, Alan. 1964. ''The Anthropology of Music''. Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press. Pp. 3-60.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach emphasizes the cultural impact of music and how music can be utilized to further understand humanity.

The two approaches to ethnomusicology bring unique perspectives to the field, providing knowledge about both the effects culture as on music and the impact music has on culture.

===Analysis===

==== Problems of analysis ====
The great diversity of musics found across the world has necessitated an interdisciplinary approach to ethnomusicological study. Analytical and research methods have changed over time, as ethnomusicology has continued solidifying its disciplinary identity, and as scholars have become increasingly aware of issues involved in cultural study (see [[Ethnomusicology#Theoretical issues and debates|Theoretical Issues and Debates]]). Among these issues are the treatment of Western music in relation to music from “other,” non-Western cultures&lt;ref name="Kolinski, Mieczyslaw 1957"&gt;Kolinski, Mieczyslaw. 1957. “Ethnomusicology, Its Problems and Methods.” Ethnomusicology 1(10): 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the cultural implications embedded in analytical methodologies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Herndon, Marcia. 1974. “Analysis: The Herding of Sacred Cows?” ''Ethnomusicology'' 18(2): 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Kofi Agawu (see 2000s) noted that scholarship on African music seems to emphasize difference further by continually developing new systems of analysis; he proposes the use of Western notation to instead highlight similarity and bring African music into mainstream Western music scholarship.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In seeking to analyze such a wide scope of musical genres, repertories, and styles, some scholars have favored an all-encompassing “objective” approach, while others argue for “native” or “subjective” methodologies tailored to the musical subject. Those in favor of “objective” analytical methods hold that certain perceptual or cognitive universals or laws exist in music, making it possible to construct an analytical framework or set of categories applicable across cultures. Proponents of “native” analysis argue that all analytical approaches inherently incorporate value judgments and that, to understand music it is crucial to construct an analysis within cultural context. This debate is well exemplified by a series of articles between [[Mieczyslaw Kolinski]] and [[Marcia Herndon]] in the mid-1970s; these authors differed strongly on the style, nature, implementation, and advantages of analytical and synthetic models including their own.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kolinski, Mieczyslaw. 1976. “Herndon’s Verdict on Analysis: Tabula Rasa.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 20(1): 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herndon, Marcia. 1976. “Reply to Kolinski: Taurus Omicida.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 20(2): 217-231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kolinski, Mieczyslaw. 1977. “Final Reply to Herndon.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 21(1): 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Herndon, backing “native categories” and inductive thinking, distinguishes between analysis and synthesis as two different methods for examining music. By her definition, analysis seeks to break down parts of a known whole according to a definite plan, whereas synthesis starts with small elements and combines them into one entity by tailoring the process to the musical material. Herndon also debated on the subjectivity and objectivity necessary for a proper analysis of a musical system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kolinski, among those scholars critiqued by Herndon's push for a synthetic approach, defended the benefits of analysis, arguing in response for the acknowledgment of musical facts and laws.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Analytical methodologies ====
As a result of the above debate and ongoing ones like it, ethnomusicology has yet to establish any standard method or methods of analysis. This is not to say that scholars have not attempted to establish universal or “objective” analytical systems. Bruno Nettl acknowledges the lack of a singular comparative model for ethnomusicological study, but describes methods by Mieczyslaw Kolinski, [[Béla Bartók]], and [[Erich von Hornbostel]] as notable attempts to provide such a model.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-one Issues and Concepts. Chapter 6. Urbana: University of Illinois, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the first of these objective systems was the development of the [[Cent (music)|cent]] as a definitive unit of pitch by phonetician and mathematician [[Alexander John Ellis|Alexander J. Ellis]] (1885). Ellis used his system, which divided the octave into 1200 cents (100 cents in each Western semitone), as a means of analyzing and comparing scale systems of different musics. Ellis presented his research in "On the Musical Scales of Various Nations," making the influential statement that “musical scales were not acoustic givens but humanly organized preferences."&lt;ref&gt;Stock, Jonathan. 2007. “Alexander J. Ellis and His Place in the History of Ethnomusicology.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 51(2): 306-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis's study is also an early example of comparative musicological fieldwork (see [[Ethnomusicology#Fieldwork|Fieldwork]]).

Alan Lomax's method of cantometrics employed analysis of songs to model human behavior in different cultures. He posited that there is some correlation between musical traits or approaches and the traits of the music's native culture.&lt;ref name="Lomax, Alan Pp. 3-33" /&gt; Cantometrics involved qualitative scoring based on several characteristics of a song, comparatively seeking commonalities between cultures and geographic regions.

Mieczyslaw Kolinski measured the exact distance between the initial and final tones in melodic patterns. Kolinski refuted the early scholarly opposition of European and non-European musics, choosing instead to focus on much-neglected similarities between them, what he saw as markers of “basic similarities in the psycho-physical constitution of mankind.”&lt;ref name="Kolinski, Mieczyslaw 1957" /&gt; Kolinski also employed his method to test, and disprove, Erich von Hornbostel's hypothesis that European music generally had ascending melodic lines, while non-European music featured descending melodic lines.

Adopting a more anthropological analytical approach, [[Steven Feld]] conducted descriptive ethnographic studies regarding “sound as a cultural system.”&lt;ref&gt;Feld, Steven. 1984 “Sound Structure as Social structure.” Ethnomusicology 28(3): 383-409.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, his studies of Kaluli people of Papua New Guinea use sociomusical methods to draw conclusions about its culture.

===Fieldwork===

Bruno Nettl, Emeritus Professor of Musicology at Illinois University,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Faculty/Bruno Nettl|url= https://music.illinois.edu/faculty/bruno-nettl |website=Illinois Department of Music|accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines fieldwork as “direct inspection [of music, culture, etc] at the source”, and states that “It is in the importance of fieldwork that anthropology and ethnomusicology are closest: It is a ‘hallmark’ of both fields, something like a union card”. The experience of an ethnomusicologist in the field is his/her data; experience, texts (e.g. tales, myths, proverbs), structures (e.g. social organization), and “impoderabilia of everyday life” all contribute to an ethnomusicologist's study.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. “10. Come Back and See Me Next Tuesday.” In The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts, 133-148. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of fieldwork in the field of ethnomusicology has required the development of effective methods to pursue fieldwork.

In the 19th century until the mid-20th century, European scholars ([[folklorists]], [[ethnographers]], and some early ethnomusicologists) who were motivated to preserve disappearing music cultures (from both in and outside of Europe), collected transcriptions or audio recordings on wax cylinders.&lt;ref name="autoB"&gt;Myers, Helen. 1992.  “Ethnomusicology.”  In ''Ethnomusicology: An Introduction'', ed. Helen Myers, 3-6. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many such recordings were then stored at the Berlin Phonogramm-Archiv at the Berlin school of [[comparative musicology]], which was founded by [[Carl Stumpf]], his student [[Erich M. von Hornbostel]], and medical doctor Otto Abraham. Stumpf and Hornbostel studied and preserved these recordings in the Berlin Archiv, setting the foundation for contemporary ethnomusicology. But, the “armchair analysis” methods of Stumpf and Horbostel required very little participation in fieldwork themselves, instead using the fieldwork of other scholars. This differentiates Stumpf and Hornbostel from their present-day contemporaries, who now use their fieldwork experience as a main component in their research.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Cooley, Timothy J. and Gregory Barz. 2008 [1997]. “Casting Shadows in the Field: An Introduction.” In ''Shadows in the Field: New Perspectives for Fieldwork in Ethnomusicology'', 2nd ed., 1-10. New York: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ethnomusicology's transition from “armchair analysis” to fieldwork reflected ethnomusicologists trying to distance themselves from the field of comparative musicology in the period following [[World War II]]. Fieldwork emphasized face-to-face interaction to gather the most accurate impression and meaning of music from the creators of the music, in contrast with “armchair analysis” that disconnected the ethnomusicologist from the individual or group of performers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[David P. McAllester|David McAllester]] was paramount in helping the discipline transition from the “armchair analysis” to culturally specific fieldwork. He worked with the [[Navajo]], living with them so he could study [[Enemy Way]] music more intimately. This work involved an entirely different conceptualization of music than that generally accepted in the West. (Navajo, like some other languages, has no direct word for music, instead referring to it in the context of its function).&lt;ref&gt;McAllester, David P. 1954. ''Enemy Way Music: A Study of Social and Esthetic Values as Seen in Navajo Music''. Cambridge, MA: Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University vol. XLI, no. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to McAllester's success, fieldwork became one of the most important parts of ethnomusicological study.

As technology advanced, researchers graduated from depending on wax cylinders and the phonograph to digital recordings and video cameras, allowing recordings to become more accurate representations of music studied. These technological advances have helped ethnomusicologists be more mobile in the field, but have also let some ethnomusicologists shift back to the “armchair analysis” of Stumpf and Hornbostel.&lt;ref&gt;"autoB"&lt;/ref&gt; Since video recordings are now considered cultural texts, ethnomusicologists can conduct fieldwork by recording music performances and creating documentaries of the people behind the music, which can be accurately studied outside of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Lysoff, Renê T. A. 1997. “Mozart in Mirrorshades: Ethnomusicology, Technology, and the Politics of Representation.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 41(2): 206-219.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the invention of the internet and forms of online communication could allow ethnomusicologists to develop new methods of fieldwork within a virtual community.

Heightened awareness of the need to approach fieldwork in an ethical manner arose in the 1970s in response to a similar movement within the field of anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Cooley, Timothy J. and Gregory Barz. 2008 [1997]. “Casting Shadows in the Field: An Introduction.” In Shadows in the Field: New Perspectives for Fieldwork in Ethnomusicology, 2nd ed., 3-24. New York: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Slobin]] writes in detail about the application of ethics to fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;Slobin, Mark. 1993. “Ethical Issues.” In Ethnomusicology: An Introduction, ed. H. Meyers, 329-336. New York: Norton&lt;/ref&gt; Several potential ethical problems that arise during fieldwork relate to the rights of the music performers. To respect the rights of performers, fieldwork often includes attaining complete permission from the group or individual who is performing the music, as well as being sensitive to the rights and obligations related to the music in the context of the host society.

Another ethical dilemma of ethnomusicological fieldwork is the inherent ethnocentrism (more commonly, eurocentrism) of ethnomusicology. Anthony Seeger, Emeritus Professor of Ethnomusicology at UCLA,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Anthony Seeger Bio|url = http://www.ethnomusic.ucla.edu/anthony-seeger-bio-1|website = UCLA Department of Ethnomusicology|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; has done seminal work on the notion of ethics within fieldwork, emphasizing the need to avoid ethnocentric remarks during or after the field work process. Emblematic of his ethical theories is a 1983 piece that describes the fundamental complexities of fieldwork through his relationship with the [[Suyá]] Indians of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Anthony. 1983. ''Why Suyá Sing''. London: Oxford University Press. Pp. xiii-xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid ethnocentrism in his research, Seeger does not explore how singing has come to exist within Suyá culture, instead explaining how singing creates culture presently, and how aspects of Suyá social life can be seen through both a musical and performative lens. Seeger's analysis exemplifies the inherent complexity of ethical practices in ethnomusicological fieldwork, implicating the importance for the continual development of effective fieldwork in the study of ethnomusicology.

===Theoretical issues and debates===

====Universals====
Ethnomusicologists initially started to question the possibility of universals because they were searching for a new approach to explain musicology that differed from [[Guido Adler]]’s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Seeger, Charles. 1975 [1970]. “Toward a Unitary Field Theory for Musicology.” In Studies in Musicology, 102-138. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Seeger]], for instance, categorized his interpretation of musical universals by using inclusion-exclusion styled Venn-diagrams to create five types universals, or absolute truths, of music.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Charles. 1978. ''Studies in Musicology 1935–1975.'' Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Universals in music are as hard to come by as universals in language since both potentially have a universal grammar or syntax. Dane Harwood noted that looking for causality relationships and “deep structure” (as postulated by Chomsky) is a relatively fruitless way to look for universals in music.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Harwood, Dane. 1976. “Universals in Music: A Perspective from Cognitive Psychology.” Ethnomusicology 20(3): 521-533.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the search for musical universalities has remained a topic amongst ethnomusicologists since [[Wilhelm Wundt]] who tried to prove that "all 'primitive' peoples have monophonic singing and use intervals.”&lt;ref name="Nettl4"&gt;Nettl, Bruno. The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-one Issues and Concepts. Chapter 4. 42, Urbana: University of Illinois, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Nettl shares the belief with his colleagues that trying to find a universal in music is unproductive because there will always be at least one instance proving that there is no  musical universals. For example, George List writes, "I once knew a missionary who assured me that the Indians to whom he had ministered on the west coast of Mexico neither sang nor whistled.” &lt;ref name="List, George 1971"&gt;List, George. 1971. “On the Non-universality of Musical Perspectives.” Ethnomusicology 15(3): 399.&lt;/ref&gt; and ethnomusicologist [[David P. McAllester]] writes, "Any student of man must know that somewhere, someone is doing something that he calls music but nobody else would give it that name. That one exception would be enough to eliminate the possibility of a real universal.”&lt;ref name="McAllester, David P 1954"&gt;McAllester, David P. 1954. Enemy Way Music: A Study of Social and Esthetic Values as Seen in Navajo Music. Cambridge, MA: Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology, 379, Harvard University vol. XLI, no. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this gamesmanship of ethnomusicologists to poke holes in universals, focus shifted from trying to find a universal to trying to find near-universals, or qualities that may unite the majority of the world's musics.

McAllester was a believer in near universals, he wrote, "I will be satisfied if nearly everybody does it,”&lt;ref name="McAllester, David P 1954"/&gt; which is why he postulated that nearly all music has a tonal center, has a tendency to go somewhere, and also has an ending.  However McAllester's main point is that music transforms the everyday humdrum into something else, bringing about a heightened experience. He likens music to having an out of body experience, religion, and sex. It is music's ability to transport people mentally, that is in his opinion a near universal that almost all musics share.

In response to McAllester's ''Universal Perspectives on Music'', [[Klaus P. Wachsmann]] counters that even a near universal is hard to come by because there are many variables when considering a very subjective topic like music and music should not be removed from culture as a singular variable. His approach, instead of finding a universal, was to create an amalgam of relations for sound and psyche: "(1) the physical properties of the sounds, (2) the physiological response to the acoustic stimuli, (3) the perception of sounds as selected by the human mind that is programmed by previous experiences, and (4) the response to the environmental pressures of the moment. In this tetradic schema lies an exhaustive model of the universals in music.”&lt;ref&gt;Wachsmann, Klaus P. 1971. “Universal Perspectives in Music.” Ethnomusicology 15(3): 382.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wachsmann does allow that they all had some influenced experience and this belief is echoed by another ethnomusicologist who shares the belief that the universal lies in the specific way music reaches the listener. "Whatever it communicates is communicated to the members of the in-group only, whoever they may be. This is as true of in-groups in our own society as in any other. Does "classical" music communicate to every American? Does rock and roll communicate to every parent?”&lt;ref name="List, George 1971"/&gt;

George List rebuts McAllester’s essay as does Wachsmann and in his rebuttal he posits that, "The only universal aspect of music seems to be that most people make it,”&lt;ref&gt;List, George. 1971. “On the Non-universality of Musical Perspectives.” Ethnomusicology 15(3): 402.&lt;/ref&gt; Once again reinstating how difficult it was for ethnomusicologists to form a universal (as he uses the words “most people). List even goes as far as to say, "The entire panel discussion, and everything I have written here, are probably equally and universally unnecessary. Like Seeger, we have probably been talking and writing to ourselves. As far as ethnomusicologists are concerned, this is likely a universal phenomenon.”&lt;ref&gt;List, George. 1971. “On the Non-universality of Musical Perspectives.” Ethnomusicology 15(3): 402.&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint asserts that the beneficiaries of finding a universal in music would not parallel the global objectives of unifying music. List also wanted to compare musics across cultures to prove that there was no universal because even between two people from the same culture there is variation. To do this, he would play Western classical music with descriptive titles for Africans and ask them to identify the title. He found that no one could subsume that a song like Sinding's ''Rustles of Spring'' could possible be about spring.&lt;ref&gt;List, George. 1971. “On the Non-universality of Musical Perspectives.” Ethnomusicology 15(3): 399-402.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dane Harwood]] suggests that while there can be no cultural universals in music there exist universal modes of cognitively understanding that we all undergo when we listen to music.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Harwood also highlighted several inherent issues with the notion of universality in music. The first of these is structure vs. function in music. He notes that human behavior is structurally predicated, and that as such, not all behavioral patterns (which some observe to find universals) imply functional activity in music. He also drew content versus process in musical behavior. In drawing this distinction, he highlighted that scholars studying universals should shift from studying what, in terms of content, various cultural groups play to the process by which individuals learn music. In summary, his view is that universals in music are not a matter of specific musical structure or function—but of basic human cognitive and social processes construing and adapting to the real world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Linguistics and semiotics====
It is often the case that interests in ethnomusicology stem from trends in anthropology, and this no different for symbols. In 1949, anthropologist Leslie White wrote, “the symbol is the basic unit of all human behavior and civilization,” and that use of symbols is a distinguishing characteristic of humans.&lt;ref name="nettl"&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. ''The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts.'' Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press. Pp. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[symbolic anthropology|symbolism]] was at the core of anthropology, scholars sought to examine music “as a symbol or system of signs or symbols,” leading to the establishment of the field of musical semiotics.&lt;ref name="nettl"/&gt; [[Bruno Nettl]] discusses various issues relating ethnomusicology to musical semiotics, including the wide variety of culturally dependent, listener-derived meanings attributed to music and the problems of authenticity in assigning meaning to music.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. ''The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts.'' Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press. Pp. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the meanings that musical symbols can reflect can relate to emotion, culture, and behavior, much in the same way that linguistic symbols function.

The interdisciplinarity of symbolism in [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]], and [[musicology]] has generated new analytical outlooks (see Analysis) with different focuses: Anthropologists have traditionally conceived of whole cultures as systems of symbols, while musicologists have tended to explore symbolism within particular repertories. [[Structuralism (linguistics)|Structural]] approaches seek to uncover interrelationships between symbolic human behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. ''The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts.'' Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press. Pp. 306-307.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, a number of scholars, including musicologist [[Charles Seeger]] and semiotician [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]], proposed using methodology commonly employed in linguistics as a new way for ethnomusicologists to study music.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nattiez, Jean-Jacques 1973"&gt;Nattiez, Jean-Jacques. 1973. “Linguistics: A New Approach for Musical Analysis?” International Review of Aesthetics and Sociology of Music 4(1): 51-67.&lt;/ref&gt; This new approach, widely influenced by the works of linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], and anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], among others, focused on finding underlying symbolic structures in cultures and their music.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In a similar vein, [[Judith Becker]] and [[Alton L. Becker]] theorized the existence of musical "grammars" in their studies of the theory of Javanese [[gamelan]] music. They proposed that music could be studied as symbolic and that it bears many resemblances to language, making semiotic study possible.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Becker and Alton L. Becker, "The Grammar of a Musical Genre, Srepegan," ''Journal of Music Theory'' 23 (1979), pp. 1–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Classifying music as a humanity rather than science, Nattiez suggested that subjecting music to linguistic models and methods might prove more effective than employing the [[scientific method]]. He proposed that the inclusion of linguistic methods in ethnomusicology would increase the field's interdependence, reducing the need to borrow resources and research procedures from exclusively other sciences.&lt;ref name="Nattiez, Jean-Jacques 1973"/&gt;

[[John Blacking]] was another ethnomusicologist who sought to create an ethnomusicological parallel to linguistic models of analysis. In his work on [[Venda]] music, he writes, “The problem of musical description is not unlike that in linguistic analysis: a particular grammar should account for the processes by which all existing and all possible sentences in the language are generated.”&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Blacking, John. 1971. “Deep and Surface Structures in Venda Music.” Yearbook of the International Folk Music Council 3: 91-108.&lt;/ref&gt; Blacking sought more than sonic description. He wanted to create a musical analytical grammar, which he coined the Cultural Analysis of Music, that could incorporate both sonic description and how cultural and social factors influence structures within music. Blacking desired a unified method of musical analysis that “...can not only be applied to all music, but can explain both the form, the social and emotional content, and the effects of music, as systems of relationships between an infinite number of variables.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Like Nattiez, Blacking saw a universal grammar as a necessary for giving ethnomusicology a distinct identity. He felt that ethnomusicology was just a “meeting ground” for anthropology of music and the study of music in different cultures, and lacked a distinguishing characteristic in scholarship. He urged others in the field to become more aware and inclusive of the non-musical processes that occur in the making of music, as well as the cultural foundation for certain properties of the music in any given culture, in the vein of [[Alan P. Merriam|Alan Merriam]]’s work.

Some musical languages have been identified as more suited to linguistically focused analysis than others. Indian music, for example, has been linked more directly to language than music of other traditions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Critics of musical semiotics and linguistic-based analytical systems, such as [[Steven Feld]], argue that music only bears significant similarity to language in certain cultures and that linguistic analysis may frequently ignore cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. ''The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts.'' Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press. Pp. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Comparison====
Since ethnomusicology evolved from comparative musicology, some ethnomusicologists' research features analytical comparison.  The problems arising from using these comparisons stem from the fact that there are different kinds of comparative studies with a varying degree of understanding between them.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. ''The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-one Issues and Concepts.'' Chapter 6. Urbana: University of Illinois, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the late 60s, ethnomusicologists who desired to draw comparisons between various musics and cultures have used [[Alan Lomax]]’s idea of [[cantometrics]].&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, Alan. 1978 [1968] ''Folk Song Style and Culture.'' New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Books. Pages 3-33 and 117-168.&lt;/ref&gt; Some cantometric measurements in ethnomusicology studies have been shown be relatively reliable, such as the wordiness parameter, while other methods are not as reliable, such as precision of enunciation.&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Edward O. 1976. “The variety of Music in a North Indian Village: Reassessing Cantometrics.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 20(1):49-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, introduced by [[Steven Feld]], is for ethnomusicologists interested in creating ethnographically detailed analysis of people’s lives; this comparative study  deals with making pairwise comparisons about competence, form, performance, environment, theory, and value/equality.&lt;ref&gt;Feld, Steven. 1984 “Sound Structure as Social Structure.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 28(3):383-409.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruno Nettl]] has noted as recently as 2003 that comparative study seems to have fallen in and out of style, noting that although it can supply conclusions about the organization of musicological data, reflections on history or the nature of music as a cultural artifact, or understanding some universal truth about humanity and its relationship to sound, it also generates a great deal of criticism regarding ethnocentrism and its place in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. “6. Apples and Oranges.” In ''The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts'', 60-73. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insider/outsider epistemology====
The relevance and implications of insider and outsider distinctions within ethnomusicological writing and practice has been a subject of lengthy debate for decades, invoked by Bruno Nettl, Timothy Rice, and others. The question that causes such debate lies in the qualifications for an ethnomusicologist to research another culture when they represent an outsider, dissecting a culture that doesn’t belong to them. Historically, ethnomusicological research was tainted with a strong bias from Westerners in thinking that their music was superior to the musics they researched. From this bias grew an apprehension of cultures to allow ethnomusicologists to study them, thinking that their music would be exploited or appropriated. There are benefits to ethnomusicological research, i.e. the promotion of international understanding, but the fear of this “musical colonialism” &lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. “11. You Will Never Understand this Music.” In ''The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts'', 149-160. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press. p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; represents the opposition to an outsider ethnomusicologist in conducting his or her research on a community of insiders.
 
In ''The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts'', Nettl discusses personal and global issues pertaining to field researchers, particularly those from a Western academic background. In a chapter that recounts his field recordings among Native Americans of the northern plains, for instance, he attempts to come to terms with the problematic history of ethnographic fieldwork, and envision a future trajectory for the practice in the 21st century and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. “10. Come Back and See Me Next Tuesday.” In ''The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts'', 133-148. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that ethnomusicology is a field that intersects in a vast array of other fields in the social sciences and beyond, it focuses on studying people, and it is appropriate to encounter the issue of “making the unfamiliar, familiar,” a phrase coined by [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] that is well known in social psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Wagoner, Brady. 2008. “Commentary: Making the Familiar Unfamiliar.” ''Culture &amp; Psychology'' 14(4): 467.&lt;/ref&gt; As in social psychology, the “unfamiliar” is encountered in three different ways during ethnomusicological work: 1) two different cultures come into contact and elements of both are not immediately explicable to the other; 2) experts within a society produce new knowledge, which is then communicated to the public; and 3) active minorities communicate their perspective to the majority.&lt;ref&gt;Wagoner, Brady. “Commentary: Making the Familiar Unfamiliar.” Culture &amp; Psychology 14.4 (2008): 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nettl has also been vocal about the effect of subjective understanding on research. As he describes, a fieldworker might attempt immersing themselves into an outsider culture to gain full understanding. This, however, can begin to blind the researcher and take away the ability to be objective in what is being studied. The researcher begins to feel like an expert in a culture's music when, in fact, they remain an outsider no matter the amount of research, because they are from a different culture. The background knowledge of each individual influences the focus of the study because of the comfort level with the material. Nettl characterizes the majority of outsiders as "simply members of Western society who study non-Western music, or members of affluent nations who study the music of the poor, or maybe city folk who visit the backward villages in their hinterland."&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. “11. You Will Never Understand this Music.” In ''The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts'', 149-160. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; This points to possible Eurocentric origins of researching foreign and exotic music. Within this outsider/insider dynamic and framework unequal power relations come into focus and question.

In addition to his critiques of the outsider and insider labels, Nettl creates a binary that roughly equates to Western and Nonwestern. He points out what he feels are flaws in Western thinking through the analyses of multiple societies, and promotes the notion of collaborating, with a greater focus on acknowledging the contribution of native experts. He writes, "The idea of joint research by an 'insider' and an 'outsider' has been mentioned as a way of bridging the chasms."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. “11. You Will Never Understand this Music.” In ''The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts'', 149-160. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of his optimism, the actualization of this practice has been limited and the degree to which this can solve the insider/outsider dilemma is questionable. He believes that every concept is studied through a personal perspective, but “a comparison of viewpoints may give the broadest possible insight.”&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. In ''The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts''. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of ethnomusicologists as outsiders looking in on a music culture, has been discussed using [[Edward Said|Said]]'s theory of [[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]. This manifests itself in the notion that music championed by the field may be, in many ways, a Western construction based on an imagined or romanticized view of "the Other" situated within a colonial mindset.&lt;ref name="said.orientalism"&gt;{{cite book | author=Said, Edward | date=1978 | title=Orientalism | place=New York | publisher=Vintage}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nettl, there are three beliefs of insiders and members of the host culture that emerge that lead to adverse results. The three are as follows: (1) "Ethnomusicologists come to compare non-Western musics or other "other" traditions to their own... in order to show that the outsider's own music is superior," (2)Ethnomusicologists want to use their own approaches to non-Western music;" and (3) "They come with the assumption that there is such a thing as African or Asian or American Indigenous music, disregarding boundaries obvious to the host."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; As Nettl argues, some of these concerns are no longer valid, as ethnomusicologists no longer practice certain orientalist approaches that homogenize and totalize various musics. He explores further intricacies within the insider/outsider dichotomy by deconstructing the very notion of insider, contemplating what geographic, social, and economic factors distinguish them from outsiders. He notes that scholars of "more industrialized African and Asian nations" see themselves as outsiders in regards to rural societies and communities.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Even though these individuals are in the minority, and ethnomusicology and its scholarship is generally written from a western perspective, Nettl disputes the notion of the native as the perpetual other and the outsider as the westerner by default.   &lt;!-- a citation to this conversation within the ethnomusicology literature is necessary --&gt;

[[Timothy Rice]] is another author who discusses the insider/outsider debate in detail but through the lens of his own fieldwork in Bulgaria and his experience as an outsider trying to learn Bulgarian music. In his experience, told through his book May it Fill Your Soul: Experiencing Bulgarian Music,&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Timothy. 1994. ''May it Fill Your Soul: Experiencing Bulgarian Music''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Pp. 3-135 and 64-88.&lt;/ref&gt; he had a difficult time learning Bulgarian music because his musical framework was founded in a Western perspective. He had to “broaden his horizons” &lt;ref&gt;Rice, Timothy. 1994. ''May it Fill Your Soul: Experiencing Bulgarian Music'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Pp. 3-135 and 64-88.&lt;/ref&gt; and try instead to learn the music from a Bulgarian framework in order to learn to play it sufficiently. Although he did learn to play the music, and the Bulgarian people said that he had learned it quite well, he admitted that “there are still areas of the tradition (...) that elude my understanding and explanation. (...) Some sort of culturally sensitive understanding (...) will be necessary to close this gap.” &lt;ref&gt;Rice, Timothy. 1994. ''May it Fill Your Soul: Experiencing Bulgarian Music''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. P. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Rice argues that despite the impossibility of being objective one's work ethnomusicologists may still learn much from self-reflection. In his book, he questions about whether or not one can be objective in understanding and discussing art and, in accordance with the philosophies of phenomenology, argues that there can be no such objectivity since the world is constructed with preexisting symbols that distort any “true” understanding of the world we are born into. He then suggests that no ethnomusicologist can ever come to an objective understanding of a music nor can an ethnomusicologist understand foreign music in the same way that a native would understand it. In other words, an outsider can never become an insider. However, an ethnomusicologist can still come to a subjective understanding of that music, which then shapes that scholar's understanding of the outside world. From his own scholarship, Rice suggests "five principles for the acquisition of cognitive categories in this instrumental tradition" among Bulgarian musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Timothy. 1994. ''May it Fill Your Soul: Experiencing Bulgarian Music''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Pp. 3-15 and 64-88.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as an outsider, Rice notes that his "understanding passed through language and verbal cognitive categories" whereas the Bulgarian instrumental tradition lacked "verbal markers and descriptors of melodic form" so "each new student had to generalize and learn on his own the abstract conceptions governing melodies without verbal or visual aids."&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Timothy. 1994. ''May it Fill Your Soul: Experiencing Bulgarian Music''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Pp. 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; With these two different methods for learning music, an outsider searching for verbal descriptions versus an insider learning from imitating, represent the essential differences between Rice's culture and the Bulgarian culture. These inherent musical differences blocked him from reaching the role of an insider.

Not only is there the question of being on the outside while studying another culture, but also the question of how to go about studying one's own society.  Nettl's approach would be to determine how the culture classifies their own music.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 1963. “A Technique of Ethnomusicology Applied to Western Culture.” Ethnomusicology 7(3): 221-224.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is interested in the categories they would create to classify their own music.  In this way, one would be able to distinguish themselves from the outsider while still having slight insider insight.  Kingsbury believes it is impossible to study a music outside of one's culture, but what if that culture is your own?&lt;ref name="Kingsbury"&gt;Kingsbury, Henry. 1988. Music, Talent, and Performance: A Conservatory Cultural System. Philadelphia: Temple UP. Pp. 3-57.&lt;/ref&gt; One must be aware of the personal bias they may impose on the study of their own culture.

Kingsbury, an American pianist and ethnomusicologist, decided to reverse the common paradigm of a Westerner performing fieldwork in a non-western context, and apply fieldwork techniques to a western subject. In 1988 he published Music, Talent, and Performance: A Conservatory Cultural System, which detailed his time studying an American northeastern conservatory. He approached the conservatory as if it were a foreign land, doing his best to disassociate his experiences and prior knowledge of American conservatory culture from his study. In the book, Kingsbury analyzes conservatory conventions he and his peers may have overlooked, such as the way announcements are disseminated, to make assertions about the conservatory's culture.  For example, he concludes that the institutional structure of the conservatory is “strikingly decentralized.”&lt;ref&gt;Kingsbury, Henry. 1988.  Music, Talent, and Performance: A Conservatory Cultural System. Philadelphia: Temple UP. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In light of professors’ absences, he questions the conservatory's commitment to certain classes. His analysis of the conservatory contains four main elements: a high premium on teachers’ individuality, teachers’ role as nodal points that reinforce a patron-client-like system of social organization, this subsequent organization's enforcement of the aural traditions of musical literacy, and the conflict between this client/patron structure and the school's “bureaucratic administrative structure.”&lt;ref name="Kingsbury, Henry 1988. P. 37"&gt;Kingsbury, Henry. 1988.  Music, Talent, and Performance: A Conservatory Cultural System. Philadelphia: Temple UP. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, it seems, Kingsbury thinks the conservatory system is inherently flawed. He emphasizes that he doesn’t intend to “chide” the conservatory, but his critiques are nonetheless far from complementary.&lt;ref name="Kingsbury, Henry 1988. P. 37"/&gt;

Another example of western ethnomusicologists studying their native environments comes from Craft's My Music: Explorations of Music in Daily Life.  The book contains interviews from dozens of (mostly) Americans of all ages, genders, ethnicities, and backgrounds, who answered questions about the role of music in their lives.  Each interviewee had their own unique, necessary, and deeply personal internal organization of their own music.  Some cared about genre, others organized the music important to themselves by artist.  Some considered music deeply important to them, some did not care about music at all.&lt;ref&gt;Crafts, Susan D., Daniel Cavicchi, and Charles Keil, ed. 1993. My Music. Middletown, CT: Wesleyan UP. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethnomusicology and Western music====
Early in the history of the field of ethnomusicology, there was debate as to whether ethnomusicological work could be done on the music of western society, or whether its focus was exclusively toward non-western music. Some early scholars, such as [[Mantle Hood]], argued that ethnomusicology had two potential focuses: the study of all non-European art music, and the study of the music found in a given geographical area.&lt;ref&gt;Hood, Mantle. 1969. “Ethnomusicology.” In Harvard Dictionary of Music. Second edition, ed. Willi Apel, 298-300. Cambridge: Harvard UP.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even as early as the 1960s some ethnomusicologists were proposing that ethnomusicological methods should also be used to examine western music. For instance, [[Alan Merriam]], in a 1960 article, defines ethnomusicology not as the study of non-European music, but as the study of music in culture.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam, Alan. 1960. “Ethnomusicology: A Discussion and Definition of the Field.” Ethnomusicology 4(3): 107-114.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so he discards some of the 'external' focus proposed by the earlier (and contemporary) ethnomusicologists, who regarded non-European music as more relevant to the attention of scholars. Moreover, he expands the definition from being centered on music to including the study of culture as well.

Modern ethnomusicologists, for the most part, consider the field to apply to western music as well as non-western.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-one Issues and Concepts. Chapter 1. Urbana: University of Illinois, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ethnomusicology, especially in the earlier years of the field, was still primarily focused on non-western cultures; it is only in recent years that ethnomusicological scholarship has begun to allow more diversity with respect to both the cultures being studied and the methods by which these cultures may be studied.&lt;ref&gt;Cooley, Timothy J. and Gregory Barz. 2008 [1997]. “Casting Shadows in the Field: An Introduction.” In Shadows in the Field: New Perspectives for Fieldwork in Ethnomusicology, 2nd ed., 3-24. New York: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the increased acceptance of ethnomusicological examinations of western music, modern ethnomusicologists still focus overwhelmingly on non-western music. One of the few major examinations of western music from an ethnomusicological focus, as well as one of the earliest, is [[Henry Kingsbury]]'s book ''Music, Talent, and Performance''.&lt;ref name="Kingsbury"/&gt; In his book, Kingsbury studies a conservatory in the north-eastern United States. His examination of the conservatory uses many of the traditional fieldwork methods of ethnomusicology.&lt;ref name="Kingsbury"/&gt;

====Ethics====
Ethics is vital in the Ethnomusicology field because the product that comes out of fieldwork can be the result of the interaction between two cultures. Applying ethics to this field will confirm that each party is comfortable with the elements in the product and ensure that each party is compensated fairly for their contribution. To learn more about the monetary effects after a work is published, please see the copyright section of this page.

Ethics is defined by Merriam-Webster as, “the principles of conduct governing an individual or a group.”&lt;ref&gt;“Ethics.” Merriam-Webster, Merriam-Webster, www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethics.&lt;/ref&gt;  In historical primary documents, there are accounts of interactions between two cultures. An example of this is Hernan Cortes’ personal journal during his exploration of the world, and his interaction with the Aztecs. He takes note of every interaction as he is a proxy the Spanish monarchy. This interaction was not beneficial to both parties because Cortes as a soldier conquered the Aztecs and seized their wealth, goods, and property in an unjust manner.&lt;ref&gt;Cortes, Hernan. Cortés Tries to Take Tenochtitlan | American Historical Association, n.d. Web. 13 Dec. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, interactions between two different cultures have not ended in both parties being uplifted. In fieldwork, the ethnomusicologist travels to a specific country with the intent to learn more about the culture, and while she is there, she will use her ethics to guide her in how she interacts with the indigenous people.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In the Society of Ethnomusicology, there is a committee on ethics that publishes the field's official Position Statement on Ethics. Because ethnomusicology has some fundamental values that stem from anthropology, some of the ethics in ethnomusicology parallel some ethics in anthropology as well. The American Anthropology Association have statements about ethics and anthropological research which can be paralleled to ethnomusicology's statement.

[[Mark Slobin]], a twentieth century ethnomusicologist, observes that discussion on ethics has been founded on several assumptions, namely that: 1) “Ethics is largely an issue for ‘Western’ scholars working in ‘non-Western’ societies”; 2) “Most ethical concerns arise from interpersonal relations between scholar and ‘informant’ as a consequence of fieldwork”; 3) “Ethics is situated within…the declared purpose of the researcher: the increase of knowledge in the ultimate service of human welfare.” Which is a reference to [[Ralph Beals]]; and 4) “Discussion of ethical issues proceeds from values of Western culture.” Slobin remarks that a more accurate statement might acknowledge that ethics vary across nations and cultures, and that the ethics from the cultures of both researcher and informant are in play in fieldwork settings.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Slobin, Mark. 1993. “Ethical Issues.” In ''Ethnomusicology: An Introduction'', ed. H. Meyers, 329-336. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some case scenarios for ethically ambiguous situations that Slobin discusses include the following:&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;

# The discovery of a rare musical instrument leads to the debate of whether it should be preserved in a museum or left in its native culture to be played, but not necessarily preserved.
# The filming of a documentary video brings up the issues of consent from those who are being filmed. Additionally, the film should not necessarily be shown if the producer is not present to answer questions or clarify the video's content if there are questions from the audience.
# Deciding how the monetary gains of a musical production should be distributed is a more prominent case of ethical concern. 
# Attaining partial permission in the field is usually not enough to justify filming or recording; every person in the group should consent to the presence of a recording device. 
# Whether truthful but possibly condemning information about a group is a situation that should be treated with extreme caution. Any information that could cause trouble for the musicians may need to be censored.
Slobin's discussion of ethical issues in ethnomusicology was surprising in that he highlights the ethnomusicology community's apathy towards the public discussion of ethical issues, as evidenced by the lackluster response of scholars at a large 1970 SEM meeting.

Slobin also points out a facet of ethical thinking among ethnomusicologists in that many of the ethical rules deal with Westerners studying in non-Western, [[third world]] countries. Any non-Western ethnomusicologists are immediately excluded from these rules, as are Westerner's studying Western music.

He also highlights several prevalent issues in ethnomusicology by using hypothetical cases from an American Anthropological Association newsletter and framing them in terms of ethnomusicology. For example: “You bring a local musician, one of your informants, to the West on tour. He wants to perform pieces you feel inappropriately represent his tradition to Westerns, as the genre reinforces Western stereotypes about the musician’s homeland… do you have the right to overrule the insider when he is on your territory?” &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Ethnomusicologists also tend towards the discussion of ethics in sociological contexts. Timothy Taylor writes on the byproducts of cultural appropriation through music, arguing that the 20th century commodification of non-western musics serves to marginalize certain groups of musicians who are not traditionally integrated into the western music production and distribution industries.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Timothy D. 1997. Global Pop: World Music, World Markets. New York and London: Routledge. Pp. 1-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Feld argues that Ethnomusicologists also have their place in analyzing the ethics of popular music collaboration, such as Paul Simon's work with traditional [[zydeco]], [[Chicano]], and South African beats on [[Graceland]]. Feld notes that inherently imbalanced power dynamics within musical collaboration can contribute to cultural exploitation.&lt;ref name="Lomax, Alan Pp. 3-33"/&gt;

When talking about ethics in ethnomusicology it is imperative that I remain specific about who it applies to. An ethnomusicologist must consider ethics if he comes from a culture that is different from the culture that he wants to conduct his research on. However, an ethnomusicologist that conducts research on a culture that is how own does not have to weigh ethics. For example, music scholar, Kofi Agawu writes about African music and all of its significant aspects. He mentions the dynamics of music among the generations, the significance of the music, and the effects of the music on the society. Agawu highlights that some scholars glaze over the spirit of African music and argues that this is problematic because the spirit is one of the most essential components in the music. Agawu is also a scholar from Africa, more specifically Ghana, so he knows more about the culture because he is a part of that culture. Being a native of the culture that one is studying is beneficial because of the instinctive insight that one has been taught since birth.&lt;ref&gt;Agawu, Kofi. 2016. ''The African Imagination in Music.'' New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Martin Rudoy Scherzinger, another twentieth-century ethnomusicologist, contests the claim that copyright law is inherently conducive to exploitation of non-Westerners by Western musicologists for a variety of reasons some of which he quotes from other esteemed ethnomusicologists: some non-Western pieces are uncopyrightable because they are orally passed down, some “sacred songs are issued forth by ancient spirits or gods” giving them no other to obtain copyright, and the concept of copyright may only be relevant in “commercially oriented societies”. Furthermore, the very notion of originality (in the West especially) is a quagmire in and of itself.  Scherzinger also brought several issues to the forefront that also arise with metaphysical interpretations of authorial autonomy because of his idea that Western aesthetical interpretation is not different than non-Western interpretation. That is, all music is “for the good of mankind” yet the law treats it differently.&lt;ref name="Scherzinger, Martin 1999"&gt;Scherzinger, Martin. 1999. “Music, Spirit Possession, and the Copyright Law: Cross-Cultural Comparisons and Strategic Speculations.” ''Yearbook for Traditional Music'' 31: 102-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender====
[[Gender]] concerns have more recently risen to prominence in the methodology of ethnomusicology. 
Modern researchers often criticize historical works of ethnomusicology as showing gender-biased research and [[androcentric]] theoretical models that do not reflect reality. There are many reasons for this issue. Historically, ethnomusicological fieldwork often focused on the musical contributions of men, in line with the underlying assumption that male-dominated musical practices were reflective of musical systems of a society as a whole. Other gender-biased research may have been attributed to the difficulty in acquiring information on female performers without infringing upon cultural norms that may not have accepted or allowed women to perform in public (reflective of social dynamics in societies where men dominate public life and women are mostly confined to the private sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press. Pp.410&lt;/ref&gt; ). Finally, men have traditionally dominated fieldwork and institutional leadership positions and tended to prioritize the experiences of men in the cultures they studied.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen, Koskoff. 1987. “An Introduction to Women, Music, and Culture.” In Women and Music in Cross-Cultural Perspective, ed. Ellen Koskoff, Westport, Ct: Greenwood Press Pp.1.&lt;/ref&gt; With a lack of accessible female informants and alternative forms of collecting and analyzing musical data, ethnomusicological researchers such as Ellen Koskoff believe that we may not be able to fully understand the musical culture of a society. Ellen Koskoff quotes Rayna Reiter, saying that bridging this gap would explain the “seeming contradiction and internal workings of a system for which we have only half the pieces.”&lt;ref&gt;Ellen, Koskoff. 1987. “An Introduction to Women, Music, and Culture.” In Women and Music in Cross-Cultural Perspective, ed. Ellen Koskoff, Westport, Ct: Greenwood Press. Pp.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the historical trend of overlooking gender, modern ethnomusicologists believe that studying gender can provide a useful lens to understand the musical practices of a society.  Considering the divisions of gender roles in society, ethnomusicologist Ellen Koskoff writes: “Many societies similarly divide musical activity into two spheres that are consistent with other symbolic dualisms”, including such culture-specific, gender-based dualisms as private/public, feelings/actions, and sordid (provocative)/holy.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen, Koskoff. 1987. “An Introduction to Women, Music, and Culture.” In Women and Music in Cross-Cultural Perspective, ed. Ellen Koskoff, Westport, Ct: Greenwood Press. p.8&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, music comes to reflect those divisions in such a way that women's music and instrumentation is viewed as “non-music” as opposed to men's “music”.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen, Koskoff. 1987. “An Introduction to Women, Music, and Culture.” In Women and Music in Cross-Cultural Perspective, ed. Ellen Koskoff, Westport, Ct: Greenwood Press. Pp.9&lt;/ref&gt; These and other dualities of musical behavior can help demonstrate societal views of gender, whether the musical behavior support or subvert gender roles.

Women contributed extensively to ethnomusicological fieldwork from the 1950s onward, but women's and gender studies in ethnomusicology took off in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Nettl, Bruno 2005. p.409"&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press. Pp.409&lt;/ref&gt; Ellen Koskoff articulates three stages in women's studies within ethnomusicology: first, a corrective approach that filled in the basic gaps in our knowledge of women's contributions to music and culture; second, a discussion of the relationships between women and men as expressed through music; third, integrating the study of sexuality, performance studies, semiotics, and other diverse forms of meaning-making.&lt;ref name="Nettl, Bruno 2005. p.409"/&gt; Since the 1990s, ethnomusicologists have begun to consider the role of the fieldworker's identity, including [[gender]] and [[sexuality]], in how they interpret the music of other cultures. For example, Susan McClary's watershed book Feminine Endings (1991) shows “relationships between musical structure and socio-cultural values” and has influenced ethnomusicologists, although it is not an ethnomusicological book.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press. Pp.414&lt;/ref&gt; There is a general understanding that Western conceptions of gender, sexuality, and other social constructions do not necessarily apply to other cultures and that a predominantly Western lens can cause various methodological issues for researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. 2005. The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-One Issues and Concepts. Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press. Pp.417-18&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of gender in ethnomusicology is also tied to the idea of {{em|reflexive ethnography}}, in which researchers critically consider their own identities in relation to the societies and people they are studying. For example, Katherine Hagedorn uses this technique in ''Divine Utterances: The Performance of Afro-Cuban Santeria''.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Throughout her description of her fieldwork in Cuba, Hagedorn remarks how her positionality, through her whiteness, femaleness, and foreignness, afforded her luxuries out of reach of her Cuban counterparts. Her positionality also put her in an “outsider” perspective on Cuban culture and affected her ability to access the culture as a researcher on Santeria. Her whiteness and foreignness, she writes, allowed her to circumvent intimate inter-gender relations centered around performance using the [[Batá drum|bata drum]]. Unlike her Cuban female counterparts who faced stigma, she was able to learn to play the bata and thus formulate her research.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Hagedorn, Katherine J. 2001. Divine Utterances: The Performances of Afro-Cuban Santeria. Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press. Pp.20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mass media====
In the first chapter of his book Popular Music of the Non-Western World,&lt;ref&gt;Manuel, Peter. 1988. “Perspectives on the Study of Non-Western Popular Musics.” In ‘’Popular Music of the Non-Western World’’, 1-23. New York: Oxford UP.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Manual examines the effect technology has had on non-western music by discussing its ability to disseminate, change, and influence music around the world. He begins with a discussion about definitions of genres, highlighting the difficulties in distinguishing between folk, classical, and popular music, within any one society. By tracing the historical development of the phonograph, radio, cassette recordings, and television, Manuel shows that, following the practice set in the western world, music has become a commodity in many societies, that it no longer has the same capacity to unite a community, to offer a kind of “mass catharsis” as one scholar put it. He stresses that any modern theoretical lens from which to view music must account for the advent of technology.

====Copyright====
Copyright is defined as “the exclusive right to make copies, license, and otherwise exploit a literary, musical, or artistic work, whether printed, audio, video, etc."&lt;ref&gt;"Copyright." Dictionary.com. Dictionary.com, n.d. Web. 13 Dec. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is imperative because copyright is what dictates where credit and monetary awards should be allocated. While ethnomusicologists conduct fieldwork, they sometimes must interact with the indigenous people. Additionally, since the purpose of the ethnomusicologists being in a particular country is so that she can collect information to make conclusions. The researchers leave their countries of interest with interviews, videos, text, along with multiple other sources of valuable. Rights surrounding music ownership are thus often left to ethics.

The specific issue with copyright and ethnomusicology is that copyright is an American right; however, some ethnomusicologists conduct research in countries that are outside of the United States. For example, Anthony Seeger details his experience while working with the Suyá people of Brazil and the release of their song recordings. The Suyá people have practices and beliefs about inspiration and authorship, where the ownership roots from the animals, spirits, and “owned” by entire communities. In the American copyright laws, they ask for a single original author, not groups of people, animals, or spirits. Situations like Seeger's then result in the indigenous people not being given credit or sometime into being able to have access to the monetary wealth that may come along with the published goods. Seeger also mentions that in some cases, copyright will be granted, but the informant-performer, the researcher, the producer, and the organization funding the research –earns the credit that the indigenous people deserve.” ”&lt;ref name="Seeger, Anthony 1992"&gt;{{cite news|author = Seeger, Anthony|year = 1983|title = Why Suyá Sing|journal = |volume = |issue = |pages = xiii-xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin Scherzinger mentions how copyright is dealt with in the Senegal region of Africa. The copyright benefits, such as royalties, from music are allocated to the Senegalese government, and then the government in turn hosts a talent competition, where the winner receives the royalties. Scherzinger offers a differing opinion on copyright, and argues that the law is not inherently ethnocentric.&lt;ref&gt;Scherzinger, Martin. 1999. “Music, Spirit Possession, and the Copyright Law: Cross-Cultural Comparisons and Strategic Speculations.” Yearbook for Traditional Music 31: 102-25.
&lt;/ref&gt; He cites the early ideology behind copyright in the 19th century, stating that spiritual inspiration did not prohibit composers from being granted authorship of their works. Furthermore, he suggests that group ownership of a song is not significantly different from the collective influence in Western classical music of several composers on any individual work.

A solution to some of the copyright issue that the ethnomusicology is having is to push for the broadening of the copyright laws in the United States. To broaden is equivalent to changing who can be cited as the original author of a piece of work to include the values that specific societies have. In order for this to be done, ethnomusicologists have to find a common ground amongst the copyright issues that they have encountered collectively.

====Identity====
The origins of music and its connections to identity have been debated throughout the history of ethnomusicology. Thomas Turino defines “self,” “identity,” and “culture” as patterns of habits, such that tendencies to respond to stimuli in particular ways repeat and reinscribe themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Turino, Thomas. 2008. Music as Social Life: The Politics of Participation. Chicago and
London: The University of Chicago Press. p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Musical habits and our responses to them lead to cultural formations of identity and identity groups. For Martin Stokes, the function of music is to exercise collective power, creating barriers among groups. Thus, identity categories such as ethnicity and nationality are used to indicate oppositional content.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, Martin. 1994. Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place. Oxford: Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as music reinforces categories of self-identification, identity can shape musical innovation. George Lipsitz's 1986 case study of [[Mexican-American]] music in [[Los Angeles]] from the 1950s to the 1980s posits that [[Chicano]] musicians were motivated to integrate multiple styles and genres in their music to represent their multifaceted cultural identity.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Lipsitz, George. “Cruising around the Historical Bloc: Postmodernism and Popular Music in East Los Angeles.” ''Cultural Critique 5'' (Winter 1986–1987): 157-77. pp. 158-59&lt;/ref&gt; By incorporating Mexican folk music and modern-day barrio influences, Mexican rock-and-roll musicians in LA made commercially successful postmodern records that included content about their community, history, and identity.&lt;ref name="Lipsitz, George 1987"&gt;Lipsitz, George. 1986/7. “Cruising around the Historical Bloc: Postmodernism and Popular Music in East Los Angeles.” ''Cultural Critique 5'' (Winter 1986–1987): 157-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Lipsitz suggests that the Mexican community in Los Angeles reoriented their traditions to fit the postmodern present. Seeking a “unity of disunity”, minority groups can attempt to find solidarity by presenting themselves as sharing experience with other oppressed groups. According to Lipsitz, this disunity creates a disunity that furthermore engenders a "historical bloc," made up of numerous, multifaceted, marginalized cultures.

Lipsitz noted the bifocal nature of the rock group Los Lobos is particularly exemplary of this paradox. They straddled the line by mixing traditional Mexican folk elements with white rockabilly and African American rhythm and blues, while simultaneously conforming to none of the aforementioned genres. That they were commercially successful was unsurprising to Lipsitz- their goal in incorporating many cultural elements equally was to play to everyone. In this manner, in Lipsitz's view, the music served to break down barriers in its up front presentation of “multiple realities”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Lipsitz describes the weakening effect that the dominant (Los Angeles) culture imposes on marginalized identities. He suggests that the mass media dilutes minority culture by representing the dominant culture as the most natural and normal.&lt;ref name="Lipsitz, George 1987"/&gt; Lipsitz also proposes that capitalism turns historical traditions of minority groups into superficial icons and images in order to profit on their perception as “exotic” or different. Therefore, the commodification of these icons and images results in the loss of their original meaning.

Minorities, according to Lipsitz, cannot fully assimilate nor can they completely separate themselves from dominant groups. Their cultural marginality and misrepresentation in the media makes them aware of society's skewed perception of them.&lt;ref name="Lipsitz, George 1987"/&gt; Antonio Gramsci suggests that there are “experts in legitimization”, who attempt to legitimize dominant culture by making it look like it is consented by the people who live under it. He also proposes that the oppressed groups have their own “organic intellectuals” who provide counter-oppressive imagery to resist this legitimization.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Gramsci, ''Selections from the Prison Notebooks'', eds. Quintin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith (New York: International Publishers, 1971), 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Low riders used irony to poke fun at popular culture's perception of desirable vehicles, and bands like Los Illegals provided their listening communities with a useful vocabulary to talk about oppression and injustice.&lt;ref name="Lipsitz, George 1987"/&gt;

Michael M.J. Fisher breaks down the following main components of postmodern sensibility: “bifocality or reciprocity of perspectives, juxtaposition of multiple realities-intertextuality, inter-referentiality, and comparisons through families of resemblance.”&lt;ref&gt;Michael M.J. Fischer, "Ethnicity and the Post-Modern Arts of Memory," in James Clifford and George Marcus, eds., ''Writing Culture'' (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; A reciprocity of perspectives makes music accessible inside and outside of a specific community. Chicano musicians exemplified this and juxtaposed multiple realities by combining different genres, styles, and languages in their music.&lt;ref name="Lipsitz, George 1987"/&gt; This can widen the music's reception by allowing it to mesh within its cultural setting, while incorporating Mexican history and tradition.  Inter-referentiality, or referencing relatable experiences, can further widen the music's demographic and help to shape its creators’ cultural identities. In doing so, Chicano artists were able to connect their music to “community subcultures and institutions oriented around speech, dress, car customizing, art, theater, and politics.”&lt;ref name="Lipsitz, George 1987"/&gt; Finally, drawing comparisons through families of resemblance can highlight similarities between cultural styles. Chicano musicians were able to incorporate elements of R&amp;B, Soul, and Rock n’ Roll in their music.&lt;ref name="Lipsitz, George 1987"/&gt;

Music is not only used to create group identities, but to develop personal identity as well. Frith describes music's ability to manipulate moods and organize daily life.&lt;ref&gt;Frith, Simon. 2003. “Music and Everyday Life.” In The Cultural Study of Music, ed. M. Clayton, T. Herbert and R. Middleton, 149-158. New York and London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Crafts studied the role of music in individual life by interviewing a wide variety of people, from a young adult who integrated music in every aspect of her life to a veteran who used music as a way to escape his memories of war and share joy with others.&lt;ref&gt;Crafts, Susan D., Daniel Cavicchi, and Charles Keil, ed. 1993. My Music. Middletown, CT: Wesleyan UP.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars have commented on the associations that individuals develop of “my music” versus “your music”: one's personal taste contributes to a sense of unique self-identity reinforced through the practices of listening to and performing certain music.&lt;ref&gt;Turino, Thomas. 2008. Music as Social Life: The Politics of Participation. Chicago and
London: The University of Chicago Press. p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a broader inclusion of [[identity politics]] (see [[Ethnomusicology#Gender|Gender]]), ethnomusicologists have become increasingly interested in how identity shapes ethnomusicological work. Fieldworkers have begun to consider their positions within race, economic class, gender, and other identity categories and how they relate to or differ from cultural norms in the areas they study. Katherine Hagedorn's 2001 Book ''Divine Utterances: The Performance of Afro-Cuban Santería'' is an example of experiential ethnomusicology, which “...incorporates the author’s voice, interpretations, and reactions into the ethnography, musical and cultural analysis, and historical context.”&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Rebecca. “Divine Utterances: The Performance of Afro-Cuban Santería by Katherine J. Hagedorn.” Ethnomusicology 50.1 (Winter 2006): 149-151. p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; The book received the Society for Ethnomusicology's prestigious Alan P. Merriam prize in 2002, marking a broad acceptance of this new method in the institutions of ethnomusicology.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Rebecca. “Divine Utterances: The Performance of Afro-Cuban Santería by Katherine J. Hagedorn.” Ethnomusicology 50.1 (Winter 2006): 149-151. p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nationalism====
Music forms a large part of national sentiment, or patriotism. National musical styles may include songs and genres used for reification of traditional culture, or more explicitly political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David and Kertz-Welzel, Alexandra (2012).''Patriotism and Nationalism in Music Education''. Aldershot, UK: Ashgate Press {{ISBN|1409430804}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this phenomenon can be observed in Frederic Chopin, a composer with Polish ancestry who became internationally recognized within the Western classical music sphere. By invoking traditional Polish forms in his compositions, Chopin became known as a symbol for Polish national identity on an international scale.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, Martin. 1994. “Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.” In ''Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place'', 1-27. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. Pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Stokes pointed out that this work of associating Chopin's music with Polish national identity fell more upon political ideologues than upon the actual content of the music itself.&lt;ref name="Stokes, Martin 1994. P. 14"&gt;Stokes, Martin. 1994. “Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.” In ''Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place'', 1-27. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. P. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Turino, the most important factor that the successful infusion of nationalism within a nation requires is emotion. While the Rhodesian government failed to capture the emotions of the people of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe did not. He formed the Youth League, which ended up leading most party activities.&lt;ref&gt;Turino, Thomas. 2000. ''Nationalists, Cosmopolitans, and Popular Music in Zimbabwe'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. P. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; These activities took the form of nationalist rallies complete with singing, thudding drums, and tribal dances that were “designed to create an inclusive image of the nation-to-be.” These rallies advocated for a return to the old traditional African rule.&lt;ref&gt;Turino, Thomas. 2000. ''Nationalists, Cosmopolitans, and Popular Music in Zimbabwe.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. P. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; By performing certain songs or dances at rallies, that music becomes closely associated with the rallies. A country's national anthem, for example, has a strong association with national pride, and therefore nationalism. The performance of tribal dances that originated in a specific nation display the artistry and unique nature of its people. Folk songs are the same way, as they are unique to the country in which they originated. For a spectator, watching or listening to this music from your country stirs a great sense of national pride inside them, and that leads to the emotion that is required in nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Turino, Thomas. 2000. ''Nationalists, Cosmopolitans, and Popular Music in Zimbabwe.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Pp. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples also demonstrate how national musical styles are constructed in the service of unifying a nation-state, particularly in line with modernizing developments.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, Martin. 1994. “Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.” In ''Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place'', 1-27. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. P. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Turino examined musical nationalism and its implications within and across national boundaries, defining musical nationalism as the incorporation of local ‘folk’ elements elite or cosmopolitan musical styles.&lt;ref&gt;Turino, Thomas. 2000. Nationalists, Cosmopolitans, and Popular Music in Zimbabwe. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. P. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial Western powers had a hand in introducing cosmopolitan styles, and Zimbabweans were also influential in shaping their sense of nation.&lt;ref&gt;Turino, Thomas. 2000. ''Nationalists, Cosmopolitans, and Popular Music in Zimbabwe.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; This process of nation-building required a constant negotiation the need for local emblems (such as national music) and the need to define one's own nation in relation to others throughout the world. Such a balancing act necessitated the creation of a new national culture through modernizing reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Turino, Thomas. 2000. ''Nationalists, Cosmopolitans, and Popular Music in Zimbabwe.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; National music in Zimbabwe, then, can be described as any music, foreign or domestic, used in the process of forwarding nationalist movements.&lt;ref&gt;Turino, Thomas. 2000. ''Nationalists, Cosmopolitans, and Popular Music in Zimbabwe.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Turino describes how his study necessitated working with a wide range of people involved with music, including “white music teachers, farmer’s wives, and suburbanites; music-business executives, producers, and managers; professionals of the black middle class; Shona peasants of different age groups in the rural northeast; members of regional, working-class, dance-drumming clubs in the townships around Harare...; a number of mbira players dedicated to indigenous Shona practices and knowledge...; members of professional “folkloric” dance groups; state cultural officials and workers; my black, middle-class neighbors in Mabelreign suburb where I lived with my family; and a broad spectrum of popular guitar-band musicians."&lt;ref&gt;Turino, Thomas. 2000. ''Nationalists, Cosmopolitans, and Popular Music in Zimbabwe.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. P. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; This diverse group of people all help to define the national music of Zimbabwe, bringing in both local and cosmopolitan perspectives. Turino emphasizes that these perspectives are not blended into a single vision. For example, practices rooted in times that predate colonial influences can still differ from those associated with modern cosmopolitanism.&lt;ref&gt;Turino, Thomas. 2000. ''Nationalists, Cosmopolitans, and Popular Music in Zimbabwe.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Afghanistan in the early twentieth century, radio technology was used to broadcast nationalist ideals to rural areas. Music played on Afghan radio blended Hindustani, Persian, Pashtun, and Tadjik traditions into a single national style, blurring ethnic lines at the behest of nationalist "ideologues."&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, Martin. 1994. “Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.” In ''Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place'', 1-27. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. P. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Early twentieth-century reformers in Turkey also made use of the radio. The nationalist state broadcast European classical music to try and unify Turkey into a modern “Western” nation, but rural populations had little interest in this music.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, Martin. 1994. “Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.” In ''Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place'', 1-27. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. Pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they could tune in to Egyptian radio.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, Martin. 1994. “Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.” In ''Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place'', 1-27. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. P. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil, the scholar Mário de Andrade theorized an integration of European, African, and Amerindian styles to create a Brazilian national music. This constructed hybrid identity persisted in academic studies of Brazilian folklore and anthropology.&lt;ref name="Stokes, Martin 1994. P. 14"/&gt; Turino mentions how nationalists in Zimbabwe used music as a means for unification both before and after their independence in 1980. During the war for independence through the 1970s, ZANU nationalists and their ZANLA guerillas used political songs as a means for engaging lower classes in the nationalist fight. Traditional Shona cultural practices, including music, were cited as areas of common ground through which ZANU tried to bridge divides between economic classes, attempting to create a more unified Zimbabwe amidst the fight for independence.&lt;ref&gt;Turino, Thomas. 2000. ''Nationalists, Cosmopolitans, and Popular Music in Zimbabwe.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; After Robert Mugabe gained power over newly independent Zimbabwe in 1980, the government established nationalist arts programs such as a National Dance Company and various other institutions to preserve and define Zimbabwe's artistic culture.&lt;ref&gt;Turino, Thomas. 2000. ''Nationalists, Cosmopolitans, and Popular Music in Zimbabwe.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. P 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of national musical styles can also originate from outside a given nation. In colonial west Africa, British rulers tended to endorse the music of rural "tribal" peoples—but not the music of more economically elite indigenous groups—as representative of national identity. Well-to-do populations were seen as a threat to British sovereignty, whereas lower-class peoples were not.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, Martin. 1994. “Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.” In ''Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place'', 1-27. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. Pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In a related vein, the French scholar Radolphe d’Erlanger undertook a project of reviving older musical forms in Tunisia in order to reconstruct "Oriental music" played on instruments such as the ''ud'' and ''ghazal''. Performing ensembles using such instruments were featured at the 1932 Congress of Arab Music in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, Martin. 1994. “Introduction: Ethnicity, Identity and Music.” In ''Ethnicity, Identity, and Music: The Musical Construction of Place'', 1-27. Edited by Martin Stokes. Oxford: Berg. P. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas are transferable to any musical culture around the world. In his book, Music, Race, and Nation, Peter Wade discusses the “community of anonymity,” or the “identification of the citizen with other unknown compatriots in a common allegiance to the nation itself”.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Peter. 2000. Music, Race, and Nation. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. P. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Music allows for people within a nation to connect when they would not be able to otherwise. Two people from villages or cities hundreds or thousands of miles away may have different traditions or customs, but they also might know the same folk music from their nation, and can connect that way.

Music is largely responsible for national identity. In addition, it can differentiate between different social classes, giving it social identity.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Peter. 2000. Music, Race, and Nation. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. P. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; On the idea of identity in music, Wade says, “A focus on the constitutive nature of music helps to grasp changing relations between musical style and identity since, instead of seeing a given style as essentially linked to a given identity, one can see how the same or similar musical styles can help constitute various identities in different contexts”.&lt;ref name="Wade, Peter 2000. P. 25"&gt;Wade, Peter. 2000. Music, Race, and Nation. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. P. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; And while some music is linked to a specific identity, music oftentimes crosses boundaries and changes associations over the course of many years.&lt;ref name="Wade, Peter 2000. P. 25"/&gt; This identity gives music a certain amount of authenticity for people, and that is another contributing factor to nationalism. According to Wade, part of Colombia's specific nationalist music identity originated from its position on the Caribbean Sea. As a major center for commercialization in the region, Colombian culture (including its music) became standardized as it was influenced by outside cultures. And soon, Colombians began to consume different types of music than before, as “tastes and ideas were all being formed within the whole changing ideological fields of nation, race, gender, sexuality, modernity, and tradition”.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Peter. 2000. Music, Race, and Nation. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. P. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; He points specifically to the success of Carlos Vives's 1993 album featuring modernized versions of vallenato songs from the 1930s from the Caribbean coastal region.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Peter. 2000. Music, Race, and Nation. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. P. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Updating those songs gave them new life and identity for a modern audience. Also, music began to be imported from other nations, further changing the musical styles as musicians found new inspiration in other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Peter. 2000. Music, Race, and Nation. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. P. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The example of the Colombian coastal region demonstrates how globalization has effected some nationalism. As music becomes more and more globalized, the concept of what a nation's music identity is can fade. Performers often face a choice, to stick to their traditional musical roots or conform to popular trends and present modernized fusion of cultures in their music.&lt;ref&gt;Lipsitz, George. 1986/7. “Cruising around the Historical Bloc: Postmodernism and Popular 
Music in East Los Angeles.” Cultural Critique 5 (Winter 1986–1987): 157-77.&lt;/ref&gt; This dilemma will only continue to grow in the years to come.

[[World beat]] can be considered contrary to nationalism, designed to appeal to a more global audience by mixing styles of disparate cultures. This may compromise cultural authenticity while commodifying cultural tradition.&lt;ref&gt;(Feld, Steven. 1988. “Notes on ‘World Beat’.” Public Culture Bulletin 1(1): 31.)&lt;/ref&gt;(see [[Ethnomusicology#Globalization|Globalization]])

====Globalization====
Through technological advances of the late twentieth century, recordings of music from around the world began to enter the Euro-American music industry. Timothy Taylor discusses the arrival and development of new terminology in the face of [[globalization]]. The term “World Music” was developed and popularized as a way to categorize and sell “non-Western” music. The term “world music” began in the 1990s as a marketing term to classify and sell records from other parts of the world under a unified label, and world music was introduced as a category in the Grammys shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Timothy D. 1997. ''Global Pop: World Music, World Markets. New York and London:'' Routledge. p.11&lt;/ref&gt; The term “world beat” was also employed in the 90s to refer specifically to pop music, but it has fallen out of use.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Timothy D. 1997. ''Global Pop: World Music, World Markets. New York and London:'' Routledge. p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The issue that these terms present is that they perpetuate an “us” vs. “them” dichotomy, effectively “othering” and combining musical categories outside of the Western tradition for the sake of marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Timothy D. 1997. ''Global Pop: World Music, World Markets. New York and London:'' Routledge. 1-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turino proposes the use of the term "cosmopolitanism" rather than "globalization" to refer to contact between world musical cultures, since this term suggests a more equitable sharing of music traditions and acknowledges that multiple cultures can productively share influence and ownership of particular musical styles.&lt;ref&gt;Turino, Thomas. 2000. ‘’Nationalists, Cosmopolitans, and Popular Music in Zimbabwe’’. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Another relevant concept is [[glocalization]], and a typology for how this phenomenon impacts music (called “Glocal BAG model”) is proposed in the book ''Music Glocalization''.&lt;ref&gt;Hebert, David G. &amp; Rykowski, Mikolaj. 2018. ‘’Music Glocalization: Heritage and Innovation in a Digital Age’’. Newcastle: Cambridge Scholars Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The issue of appropriation has come to the forefront in discussions of music's globalization, since many Western European and North American artists have participated in “revitalization through appropriation,” claiming sounds and techniques from other cultures as their own and adding them to their work without properly crediting the origins of this music.&lt;ref&gt;Feld, Steven. 1988. “Notes on ‘World Beat’.” ''Public Culture Bulletin'' 1(1): 31&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Feld explores this issue further, putting it in the context of colonialism: admiration alone of another culture's music does not constitute appropriation, but in combination with power and domination (economic or otherwise), insufficient value is placed on the music's origin and appropriation has taken place. If the originators of a piece of music are given due credit and recognition, this problem can be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Feld, Steven. 1988. “Notes on ‘World Beat’.” ''Public Culture Bulletin'' 1(1): 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Feld criticizes the claim to ownership of appropriated music through his examination of [[Paul Simon]]'s collaboration with South African musicians during the recording of his ''[[Graceland]]'' album. Simon paid the South African musicians for their work, but he was given all of the legal rights to the music. Although it was characterized by what seems to be fair compensation and mutual respect, Feld suggests that Simon shouldn’t be able to claim complete ownership of the music.&lt;ref name="Feld, Steven 1988"&gt;Feld, Steven. 1988. “Notes on ‘World Beat’.” ''Public Culture Bulletin'' 1(1): 31-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Feld holds the music industry accountable for this phenomenon, because the system gives legal and artistic credit to major contract artists, who hire musicians like “wage laborers” due to how little they were paid or credit they were given. This system rewards the creativity of bringing the musical components of a song together, rather than rewarding the actual creators of the music. As globalization continues, this system allows capitalist cultures to absorb and appropriate other musical cultures while receiving full credit for its musical arrangement.&lt;ref name="Feld, Steven 1988"/&gt;

Feld also discusses the subjective nature of appropriation, and how society's evaluation of each case determines the severity of the offense. When American singer [[James Brown]] borrowed African rhythms, and when the African musician [[Fela Kuti]] borrowed elements of style from James Brown, their common roots of culture made the connection more acceptable to society. However, when the Talking Heads borrow style from James Brown, the distancing between the artist and the appropriated music is more overt to the public eye, and the instance becomes more controversial from an ethical standpoint.&lt;ref name="Feld, Steven 1988"/&gt; Thus, the issue of cycling Afro-Americanization and Africanization in Afro-American/African musical material and ideas is embedded in "power and control because of the nature of record companies and their cultivation of an international pop music elite with the power to sell enormous numbers of recordings." &lt;ref&gt;Feld, Steven. 1988. “Notes on ‘World Beat’.” ''Public Culture Bulletin'' 1(1): 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Gibb Schreffler&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gibb Schreffler|url = http://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/gibb-schreffler|website = Pomona College in Claremont, California - Pomona College|accessdate = 2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; also examines globalization and diaspora through the lens of Punjabi pop music.&lt;ref name="Schreffler, Gibb 2012"/&gt; Schreffler's writing on [[bhangra (music)|bhangra]] music is a commentary on the dissemination of music and its physical movement. As he suggests, the function and reception of Punjabi music changed drastically as increasing migration and globalization catalyzed the need for a cohesive Punjabi identity, emerging "as a stopgap during a period that was marked by the combination of large-scale experiences of separation from the homeland with as yet poor communication channels."&lt;ref&gt;Schreffler, Gibb. 2012. “Migration Shaping Media: Punjabi Popular Music in a Global Historical Perspective.” ''Popular Music and Society'' 35(3): 333.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, before liberation from British colonial rule, music that carried the explicit "Punjabi" label primarily had the function of regional entertainment. In contrast, Punjabi music of the 1940s and 50s coincided with a wave of Punjabi nationalism that replaced regionalist ideals of earlier times. The music began to form a particular genteel identity in the 1960s that was accessible even to Punjabi expatriates.

During the 1970s and 80s, Punjabi pop music began to adhere aesthetically to more cosmopolitan tastes, often overshadowing music that reflected a truly authentic Punjabi identity. Soon after, the geographic and cultural locality of Punjabi pop became a prevalent theme, reflecting a strong relationship to the globalization of widespread preferences. Schreffler explains this shift in the role of Punjabi pop in terms of different worlds of performance: amateur, professional, sacred, art, and mediated. These worlds are primarily defined by the act and function of the musical act, and each is a type of marked activity that influences how the musical act is perceived and the social norms and restrictions to which it is subject.&lt;ref&gt;Schreffler, Gibb. 2012. “Migration Shaping Media: Punjabi Popular Music in a Global Historical Perspective.” ''Popular Music and Society'' 35(3): 337-339.&lt;/ref&gt; Punjabi popular music falls into the mediated world due to globalization and the dissemination of commercial music separating performance from its immediate context. Thus, Punjabi popular music eventually "evolved to neatly represent certain dualities that are considered to characterize Punjabi identity: East/West, guardians of tradition/embracers of new technology, local/diaspora."&lt;ref&gt;Schreffler, Gibb. 2012. “Migration Shaping Media: Punjabi Popular Music in a Global Historical Perspective.” ''Popular Music and Society'' 35(3): 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of globalization in music concerns cases of traditions that are officially recognized by [[UNESCO]], or promoted by national governments, as cases of notable global heritage. In this way, local traditions are introduced to a global audience as something that is so important as to both represent a nation and be of relevance to all people everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Keith. 2018. The Life and Death of Music as East Asian Intangible Cultural Heritage. In: Hebert, D. G. (Ed.), ''International Perspectives on Translation, Education and Innovation in Japanese and Korean Societies.'' New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Cognition====
{{Main|Culture in music cognition}}
{{See also|Music psychology}}

Cognitive psychology, neuroscience, anatomy, and similar fields have endeavored to understand how music relates to an individual's perception, cognition, and behavior. Research topics include pitch perception, representation and expectation, timbre perception, rhythmic processing, event hierarchies and reductions, musical performance and ability, musical universals, musical origins, music development, cross-cultural cognition, evolution, and more.

From the cognitive perspective, the brain perceives auditory stimuli as music according to gestalt principles, or “[[principles of grouping]].”  Gestalt principles include proximity, similarity, closure, and continuation.  Each of the gestalt principles illustrates a different element of auditory stimuli that cause them to be perceived as a group, or as one unit of music.  Proximity dictates that auditory stimuli that are near to each other are seen as a group.  Similarity dictates that when multiple auditory stimuli are present, the similar stimuli are perceived as a group.  Closure is the tendency to perceive an incomplete auditory pattern as a whole—the brain “fills in” the gap.  And continuation dictates that auditory stimuli are more likely to be perceived as a group when they follow a continuous, detectable pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Harré, Rom; Tan, Siu-Lan; Pfordresher, Peter and Harre, Rom. Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance. New York, NY: Taylor and Francis, 2010.  77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[perception]] of music has a quickly growing body of literature. Structurally, the auditory system is able to distinguish different pitches (sound waves of varying frequency) via the complementary vibrating of the eardrum. It can also parse incoming sound signals via pattern recognition mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Bregman, A.S. 1990. ''Auditory Scene Analysis: The Perceptual Organization of Sound''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitively, the brain is often constructionist when it comes to pitch. If one removes the fundamental pitch from a harmonic spectrum, the brain can still “hear” that missing fundamental and identify it through an attempt to reconstruct a coherent harmonic spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Terhardt, E. 1974. Pitch, consonance, and harmony. ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America'', 55, 1061–1069.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that much more is learned perception, however. Contrary to popular belief, absolute pitch is learned at a critical age, or for a familiar timbre only.&lt;ref&gt;Takeuchi, A.H. &amp; Hulse, S.H. 1993. "Absolute pitch." ''Psychological Bulletin'', 113, 345-361.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, K. (1989). Absolute pitch identification: Effects of timbre and pitch region. Music Perception, 7, 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Debate still occurs over whether Western chords are naturally consonant or dissonant, or whether that ascription is learned.&lt;ref&gt;Vos, J. &amp; van Vianen, B.G. (1984). Thresholds for discrimination between pure and tempered intervals: The relevance of nearly coinciding harmonics. ''Journal of the Acoustical Society of America'', 77, 176-187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeWitt, L.A. &amp; Crowder, R.G. (1987). Tonal fusion of consonant musical intervals. Perception &amp; Psychophysics, 41, 73-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Relation of pitch to frequency is a universal phenomenon, but scale construction is culturally specific.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, E.M. (1999). Intervals, scales, and tuning. In D. Deutsch (Ed.), The psychology of music (2nd ed., pp. 215-264). San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Training in a cultural scale results in melodic and harmonic expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Bharucha, J.J. (1984). Anchoring effects in music: The resolution of dissonance. Cognitive Psychology, 16, 485-518.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornelia Fales has explored the ways that expectations of timbre are learned based on past correlations. She has offered three main characteristics of timbre: timbre constitutes a link to the external world, it functions as perceptualization's primary instrument and it is a musical element that we experience without informational consciousness. Fales has gone into in-depth exploration of humankind's perceptual relation to timbre, noting that out of all of the musical elements, our perception of timbre is the most divergent from the physical acoustic signal of the sound itself. Growing from this concept, she also discusses the "paradox of timbre", the idea that perceived timbre exists only in the mind of the listener and not in the objective world. In Fales' exploration of timbre, she discusses three broad categories of timbre manipulation in musical performance throughout the world. The first of these, timbral anomaly by extraction, involves the breaking of acoustic elements from the perceptual fusion of timbre of which they were part, leading to a splintering of the perceived acoustic signal (demonstrated in overtone singing and didjeridoo music). The second, timbral anomaly by redistribution, is a redistribution of gestalt components to new groups, creating a "chimeric" sound composed of precepts made up of components from several sources (as seen in Ghanaian balafon music or the bell tone in barbershop singing). Finally, timbral juxtaposition consists of juxtaposing sounds that fall on opposing ends of a continuum of timbral structure that extends from harmonically based to formant-structured timbres (as demonstrated again in overtone singing or the use of the "minde" ornament in Indian sitar music). Overall, these three techniques form a scale of progressively more effective control of perceptualization as reliance on the acoustic world increases. In Fales' examinations of these types of timbre manipulation within Inanga and Kubandwa songs, she synthesizes her scientific research on the subjective/objective dichotomy of timbre with culture-specific phenomena, such as the interactions between music (the known world) and spiritual communication (the unknown world).&lt;ref&gt;Fales, Cornelia. 2002. “The Paradox of Timbre.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 46(1): 56-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive research has also been applied to ethnomusicological studies of rhythm.  Some ethnomusicologists believe that African and Western rhythms are organized differently.  Western rhythms may be based on ratio relationships, while African rhythms may be organized additively.  In this view, that means that Western rhythms are hierarchical in nature, while African rhythms are serial.&lt;ref&gt;Harré, Rom; Tan, Siu-Lan; Pfordresher, Peter and Harre, Rom. Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance. New York, NY: Taylor and Francis, 2010. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;  One study that provides empirical support for this view was published by Magill and Pressing in 1997.  The researchers recruited a highly experienced drummer who produced prototypical rhythmic patterns.  Magill and Pressing then used Wing &amp; Kristofferson's (1973)&lt;ref&gt;Wing, A. M., &amp; Kristofferson, A. B. (1973). Response delays and the timing of discrete motor responses. Perception &amp; Psychophysics, 14, 5– 12.&lt;/ref&gt; mathematical modeling to test different hypotheses on the timing of the drummer.  One version of the model used a metrical structure; however, the authors found that this structure was not necessary.  All drumming patterns could be interpreted within an additive structure, supporting the idea of a universal ametrical organization scheme for rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;Magill, J. M., &amp; Pressing, J. L. (1997). Asymmetric cognitive clock structures in West African rhythm. Music Perception, 15, 189– 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have also attempted to use psychological and biological principles to understand more complex musical phenomena such as performance behavior or the evolution of music, but have reached few consensuses in these areas. It is generally accepted that errors in performance give insight into perception of a music's structure, but these studies are restricted to Western score-reading tradition thus far.&lt;ref&gt;Repp, B.H. 1996. "The art of inaccuracy: Why pianists’ errors are difficult to hear." ''Music Perception'', 14, 161-184.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there are several theories to explain the evolution of music. One of theories, expanded on by Ian Cross, is the idea that music piggy-backed on the ability to produce language and evolved to enable and promote social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Ian. 2003. “Music and Biocultural Evolution” In The Cultural Study of Music, ed. M. Clayton, T. Herbert and R. Middleton, 17-27. New York and London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Cross bases his account on the fact that music is a humanly ancient art seen throughout nearly every example of human culture. Since opinions vary on what precisely can be defined as "music", Cross defines it as "complexly structured, affectively significant, attentionally entraining, and immediately—yet indeterminately—meaningful," noting that all known cultures have some art form that can be defined in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, Ian. 2003. “Music and Biocultural Evolution” In The Cultural Study of Music, ed. M. Clayton, T. Herbert and R. Middleton, 22. New York and London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same article, Cross examines the communicative power of music, exploring its role in minimizing within-group conflict and bringing social groups together and claiming that music could have served the function of managing intra and inter-group interactions throughout the course of human evolution. Essentially, Cross proposes that music and language evolved together, serving contrasting functions that have been equally essential to the evolution of humankind. Additionally, Bruno Nettl has proposed that music evolved to increase efficiency of vocal communication over long distances, or enabled communication with the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno. “In the Beginning.” The Study of Ethnomusicology: Thirty-one Issues and Concepts. Urbana: University of Illinois, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decolonizing Ethnomusicology====
The idea of [[decolonization]] is not new to the field of ethnomusicology. As early as 2006, the idea became a central topic of discussion for the [[Society for Ethnomusicology]].&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, Luis and Russel Skelchy. "Decolonizable Spaces in Ethnomusicology." ''Society for Ethnomusicology Student News'' 12(2): 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; In humanities and education studies, the term decolonization is used to describe “an array of processes involving social justice, resistance, sustainability, and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, Luis and Russel Skelchy. "Decolonizable Spaces in Ethnomusicology." ''Society for Ethnomusicology Student News'' 12(2): 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ethnomusicology, decolonization is considered to be a metaphor by some scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, Luis and Russel Skelchy. "Decolonizable Spaces in Ethnomusicology." ''Society for Ethnomusicology Student News'' 12(2): 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linda Tuhiwai Smith]], a professor of indigenous studies in New Zealand, offered a look into the shift decolonization has taken: “decolonization, once viewed as the formal process of handing over the instruments of government, is now recognized as a long-term process involving the bureaucratic, cultural, linguistic and psychological divesting of colonial power.”&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Linda Tuhiwai. 1999. ''Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples.'' London: Zed Books Ltd. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; For ethnomusicology, this shift means that fundamental changes in power structures, worldviews, academia, and the university system need to be analyzed as a confrontation of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, Luis and Russel Skelchy. "Decolonizable Spaces in Ethnomusicology." ''Society for Ethnomusicology Student News'' 12(2): 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed decolonized approach to ethnomusicology involves reflecting on the philosophies and methodologies that constitute the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Adamy, Hannah. "Reading, Decolonizing: Some Resources From Many Perspectives." ''Society for Ethnomusicology Student News'' 12(2): 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decolonization of ethnomusicology takes multiple paths. These proposed approaches are: i) ethnomusicologists addressing their roles as scholars, ii) the university system being analyzed and revised, iii) the philosophies, and thus practices, as a discipline being changed.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, Luis and Russel Skelchy. "Decolonizable Spaces in Ethnomusicology." ''Society for Ethnomusicology Student News'' 12(2): 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fall/Winter 2016 issue of the Society of Ethnomusicology's Student News contains a survey about decolonizing ethnomusicology to see their readers’ views on what decolonizing ethnomusicology entailed. The different themes were: i) decentering ethnomusicology from the United States and Europe, ii) expanding/transforming the discipline, iii) recognizing privilege and power, and iv) constructing spaces to actually talk about decolonizing ethnomusicology among peers and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Alarcon-Jimenez, Ana-Maria. "Student Voices." ''Society for Ethnomusicology Student News'' 12(2): 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the issues proposed by Brendan Kibbee for “decolonizing” ethnomusicology is how scholars might reorganize the disciplinary practices to broaden the base of ideas and thinkers. One idea posed is that the preference and privilege of the written word more than other forms of media scholarship hinders a great deal of potential contributors from finding a space in the disciplinary sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Kibbee, Brendan. "Decolonizing through Sound: Can Ethnomusicology Become More Audible?." ''Society for Ethnomusicology Student News'' 12(2): 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The possible influence of the Western bias against listening as an intellectual practice could be a reason for a lack of diversity of opinion and background within the field.&lt;ref&gt;Kibbee, Brendan. "Decolonizing through Sound: Can Ethnomusicology Become More Audible?." ''Society for Ethnomusicology Student News'' 12(2): 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The colonial aspect comes from the European prejudices regarding subjects’ intellectual abilities derived from the Kantian belief that the act of listening being seen as a “danger to the autonomy of the enlightened liberal subject.”&lt;ref&gt;Kibbee, Brendan. "Decolonizing through Sound: Can Ethnomusicology Become More Audible?." ''Society for Ethnomusicology Student News'' 12(2): 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt; As colonists reorganized the economic global order, they also created a system that tied social mobility to the ability to assimilate European schooling, forming a meritocracy of sorts.&lt;ref&gt;Kibbee, Brendan. "Decolonizing through Sound: Can Ethnomusicology Become More Audible?." ''Society for Ethnomusicology Student News'' 12(2): 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Many barriers keep “postcolonial” voices out of the academic sphere such as the inability to recognize intellectual depth in local practices of knowledge production and transmission. If ethnomusicologists start to rethink the ways in which they communicate with one another, the sphere of academia could be opened to include more than just the written word, allowing new voices to participate.&lt;ref&gt;Kibbee, Brendan. "Decolonizing through Sound: Can Ethnomusicology Become More Audible?." ''Society for Ethnomusicology Student News'' 12(2): 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another topic of discussion for decolonizing ethnomusicology is the existence of archives as a legacy of colonial ethnomusicology or a model for digital democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, Lars-Christian. 2006. "Music Archives - A Legacy of Colonial Ethnomusicology or a Model for the Digital Democracy?." ''Society for Ethnomusicology Abstracts'': 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparative musicologists used archives such as the [[Berlin Phonogramm-Archiv]] to compare the musics of the world. The current functions of such public archives within institutions and on the internet has been analyzed by ethnomusicologists.&lt;ref name="Fenn, John B 2006"&gt;Fenn, John B. 2006. "Engaging Our Data: Questions of Access, Methodology, and Use with Ethnomusicological Field Video." ''Society for Ethnomusicology Abstracts'': 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Activists and ethnomusicologists working with archives of recorded sound, like [[Aaron Fox (musicologist)|Aaron Fox]], associate professor of music and director of the Center for Ethnomusicology at Columbia University, have undertaken recovery and [[repatriation]] projects as an attempt at decolonizing the field. Another ethnomusicologist who has developed major music repatriation projects is Diane Thram, who works with the [[International Library of African Music]].&lt;ref&gt;Thram, Diane. 2014. The legacy of music archives in historical ethnomusicology: A model for engaged ethnomusicology. In J. McCollum and D. G. Hebert (Eds.), ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology.'' Lanham, MD: Lexington Books. 309–335.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar work has been dedicated towards film and field video.&lt;ref name="Fenn, John B 2006"/&gt;

===Medical Ethnomusicology===
Benjamin Koen, Gregory Barz, and Kenneth Brunnel-Smith characterize medical ethnomusicology as “a new field of integrative research and applied practice that explores holistically the roles of music and sound phenomena and related praxes in any cultural and clinical context of health and healing”. Medical ethnomusicology often focuses specifically on music and its effect on the biological, psychological, social, emotional, and spiritual realms of health. In this regard, medical ethnomusicologists have found applications of music to combat a broad range of health issues; music has found usage in the treatment of autism, dementia, AIDS and HIV, while also finding use in social and spiritual contexts through the restoration of community and the role of music in prayer and meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Barz, Gregory, Benjamin Koen, and Kenneth Brunnel-Smith. 2008. “Introduction: Confluence of Consciousness in Music, Medicine, and Culture.” ''The Oxford Handbook of Medical Ethnomusicology''. Ed. Benjamin Koen et. al. New York: Oxford University Press. 3-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theresa Allison served at a nursing home in 2006–2007, studying the effects of music on the residents of the home. The Home, as she refers to it in her publications, was rather unusual in that music was of utmost priority: the Home has over 60 hours of music and performing arts activities scheduled weekly, and dozens of residents actively participate in songwriting groups. The Home has produced a professional CD, ''Island on a Hill'', and an award-winning documentary, A '' ‘Specially Wonderful Affair'', both in 2002. With such emphasis placed in the arts, Allison concludes that the creation and performance of music has increased the residents’ quality of life by allowing them to remain active in their society through songwriting. Songwriting in the Home has fostered a sense of community among the residents and a means of transcending the institution by bringing in memories and experiences from outside their physical space.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Theresa. 2008. “Songwriting and Transcending Institutional Boundaries in the Nursing Home.” ''The Oxford Handbook of Medical Ethnomusicology''. Ed. Benjamin Koen et. al. New York: Oxford University Press. 218-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music has been found to be particularly effective in combatting dementia. In 2008, Kenneth Brummel-Smith studied the state of care for those with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and found care to be largely unsatisfactory. Rather, Brummel-Smith looks toward music as the cure to Alzheimer’s disease; he observes that nursing home residents with AD are capable of participating in structured music activities late into the disease, and that music can be used to enhance social, emotional, and cognitive skills in those with AD. Brummel-Smith calls for a more interdisciplinary approach to combatting AD, which may include music therapy if it may be suitable for a given AD patient.&lt;ref&gt;Brunnel-Smith, Kenneth. 2008. “Alzheimer’s Disease and the Promise of Music and Culture as a Healing Process.” ''The Oxford Handbook of Medical Ethnomusicology''. Ed. Benjamin Koen et. al. New York: Oxford University Press. 185-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kathleen Van Buren conducted fieldwork in Nairobi and Sheffield with the purpose of enacting positive change in the context of HIV and AIDS in each environment. Van Buren speaks about utilizing music as an agent of social change; in Nairobi, she witnessed individuals and organizing drawing upon music and the arts to promote social change within their respective communities. In Sheffield, Van Buren offered a new class on “Music and Health” at the University of Sheffield as well as World AIDS Day event with the theme “Hope through the Arts”. After the conclusion of these events, Van Buren published her findings and offered a to-do list for the ethnomusicology of HIV and AIDS. Namely, she urged ethnomusicologists to research and engage with the music community in order to facilitate the development of educational and therapy programs to further the fight against AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;Van Buren, Kathleen J. 2010. “Applied Ethnomusicology and HIV and AIDS: Responsibility, Ability, and Action.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 54(2):202–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of music used in the treatment of autism is the Music-Play Project (MPP). The MPP was inspired by an interaction in which Benjamin Koen and Michael Bakan invited their families to eat dinner together. After dinner, Koen and Bakan took out some drums and started playing music together. Mark, a 3-year-old member of the Bakan family who suffered from Asperger’s syndrome, began engaging with the music in a way that Koen describes as “miraculous”. Bakan describes Mark’s experience as a “remarkable and positive behavioral/emotional transformation in him”.&lt;ref&gt;Bakan, Michael B. 2009. “Measuring Happiness in the Twenty-First Century: Ethnomusicology, Evidence-Based Research, and the New Science of Autism.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 53(3):510–518.&lt;/ref&gt; After that moment, Koen and Bakan began hosting a six week program in which three children, accompanied by their parents, engage in freeform improvisational music creation alongside Koen and Bakan. Participants play on gamelan gongs, metallophones, and drums, which are chosen for providing rewarding sounds with minimal technique and effort from the participants. Koen and Bakan recount that the Music-Play Project has proven successful in providing children with key experiences that are particularly important in development, including forming new friendships among participants and facilitating fresh interactions between children and their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Koen, Benjamin et. al. 2008. “Personhood Consciousness: A Child-Ability-Centered Approach to Sociomusical Healing and Autism Spectrum ‘Disorders’.” ''The Oxford Handbook of Medical Ethnomusicology''. Ed. Benjamin Koen et. al. New York: Oxford University Press. 461-481.&lt;/ref&gt;

Koen’s research has also extended into the realm of the spiritual; he analyzed the role of music in ''maddâh'', a form of prayer. Koen believed in ''music-prayer dynamics'', which modeled the dynamic relationship between music, prayer, and healing. ''Maddâh'' is unique in that it encompasses all three elements of music-prayer dynamics over the course of a ceremony. Koen describes a ''maddâh'' ceremony as such: “during a ''maddâh'' ceremony, one experiences music alone, prayer alone, music and prayer combined, and unified music-prayer”. In particular, Koen focused on the restorative properties of ''maddâh'' as it was utilized in Badakhshan, Tajikistan. Being the economically poorest region of Tajikistan, Badakhshan’s culture of health care is precarious at best; there is no running water or plumbing in homes, satisfactory nutrition is hard to come by, and the psychological distress that comes with these factors leads to an abundance of health issues. As a result, ''maddâh'' is utilized to maintain health and prevent illness. Koen conducted an experiment of 40 participants from Badakhshan, in which Koen assessed the stress levels of those who participated in a ''maddâh'' ceremony using physical indicators of stress such as blood pressure and heart rate. In conclusion, Koen observed an overarching destressing effect in those who participated in ''maddâh'', regardless of the role they assumed in the ceremony. Koen attributes this to familiarity: “there was enough familiarity to engage a cultural aesthetic and dynamic that allowed a person’s consciousness to approach a flexible state, which here facilitated a state of lower stress”. Koen also noted that participants had positive feelings regarding ''maddâh''; many of the participants commented that maddâh relieves them of their emotional burdens.&lt;ref&gt;Koen, Benjamin. 2008. “Music-Prayer-Meditation Dynamics in Healing.” ''The Oxford Handbook of Medical Ethnomusicology''. Ed. Benjamin Koen et. al. New York: Oxford University Press. 93-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic programs==
{{Main|List of universities with ethnomusicology programmes}}

Many universities around the world offer ethnomusicology classes and act as centers for ethnomusicological research. The linked list includes graduate and undergraduate degree-granting programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webdb.iu.edu/sem/scripts/guidetoprograms/guidelist.cfm SEM: Guide to Programs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnochoreology==
{{Main|Ethnochoreology}}

===Definition===

The definition of ethnochoreology stands to have many similarities with the current way of studying of ethnomusicology. With ethnochoreology's roots in anthropology taken into account, and by the way that it is studied in the field, dance is most accurately defined and studied within this academic circle as two parts: as “an integral part of a network of social events” and “as a part of a system of knowledge and belief, social behavior and aesthetic norms and values”.&lt;ref&gt;Giurchescu, Anca. 2001. “The Power of Dance and Its Social and Political Uses.” ''Yearbook for Traditional Music'', vol. 33, pp. 109–121.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the study of dance in its performance aspects—the physical movements, costumes, stages, performers, and accompanied sound- along with the social context and uses within the society where it takes place.

===Beginnings===

Because of its growth alongside ethnomusicology, the beginning of ethnochoreology also had a focus on the comparative side of things, where the focus was on classifying different styles based on the movements used and the geographical location in a way not dissimilar to Lomax. This is best shown in  "Benesh Notation and Ethnochoreology" in 1967 which was published in the ethnomusicology journal, where Hall advocates using the Benesh notation as a way of documenting dance styles so that it is “possible to compare styles and techniques in detail — even ‘schools’ within one style —  and individual variations in execution from dancer to dancer.” &lt;ref&gt;Hall, Fernau. (1967). Benesh Notation and Ethnochoreology. ''Ethnomusicology'', 11(2), 188-198.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the seventies and eighties, like with ethnomusicology, ethnochoreolology had a focus on a very specific communicative type of “folklore music” performed by small groups and the context and performance aspects of dance were studied and emphasized to be a part of a whole “folkloric dance” that needed to be preserved. This was influenced by the same human centered “thick description” way of study that had moved into ethnomusicology. However, at this time, the sound and dance aspects of the performances studied were still studied and analyzed a bit separately from the context and social aspects of the culture around the dance.&lt;ref name="Ceribašić, Naila 1998"&gt;Ceribašić, Naila. 1998. Ethnomusicology and Ethnochoreology at the Institute During the Nineties. ''Narodna umjetnost : hrvatski časopis za etnologiju i folkloristiku'', 35(2), 66-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current===

Beginning in the mid eighties, there has been a reflexively interpretive way of writing about dance in culture that is more conscious of the impact of the scholar within the field and how it affects the culture and its relationship with the dance that the scholar is looking into.&lt;ref name="Ceribašić, Naila 1998"/&gt; For example, because most scholars until this point were searching for the most “authentic” folk, there was a lack of study on individual performers, popular dances, and dances of subgroups groups within a culture such as women, youth, and members of the LGBT community. In contrast, this newer wave of study wanted a more open study of dance within a culture. Additionally, there was a shift for a more mutual give and take between the scholar and the subjects, who in field work, also assist the scholars as teachers and informants.&lt;ref&gt;Zebec, Tvrtko. (2007). Experiences and Dilemmas of Applied Ethnochoreology. ''Narodna umjetnost : hrvatski časopis za etnologiju i folkloristiku'', 44(1), 7-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences with Ethnomusicology===

Although there are many similarities between ethnochoreology and ethnomusicology, there is a large difference between the current geographical scope of released studies. For example, from the beginning of ethnomusicology, there was a large focus on African and Asian musics, due to them seeming to have the most deviation from their norm while ethnochoreology, also beginning in Europe, has long had extensive studies of the Eastern European “folk dances” with relatively little of African and Asian dances, however American studies have delved into Native American and Southeast Asian dance.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Charlie T, and Kim K White. 2010. “Dance, Folk.” ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'', Volume 1, ABC-CLIO, pp. 355–362.&lt;/ref&gt;� However, the very basis of this being a difference could be challenged on the basis that many European ethnomusicological and ethnochoreological studies have been done on the "home" folk music and dance in the name of nationalism.

===Organizations===

{{cite web |url= https://ictmusic.org/group/ethnochoreology |title= ICTM Study Group on Ethnochoreology |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |publisher= International Council for Traditional Music}}, beginning in 1962 as a Folk Dance Commission before giving itself its current name in the early seventies. With the objectives of promoting research, documentation, and interdisciplinary study of dance; providing a forum for cooperation among scholars and students of ethnochoreology by means of international meetings, publications, and correspondence; and contributing to cultural and societal understandings of humanity through the lens of dance, the Study Group meets biennially for a conference.

The {{cite web |url= http://www.cordance.org/ |title= Congress on Research in Dance}}, CORD for short, currently known as the Dance Studies Association (DSA) after merging with the Society of Dance History Scholars began 1964. CORD's purposes are stated to be to encourage research in all aspects of dance and related fields;to foster the exchange of ideas, resources, and methodologies through publications, international and regional conferences and workshops; and to promote the accessibility of research materials. CORD publishes a peer-reviewed scholarly journal called The Dance Research Journal, twice annually.

'''Eutrophication''' (from Greek ''eutrophos'', "well-nourished"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=eutrophia|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/eutrophia|website=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|edition=Fifth|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company|accessdate=10 March 2018|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''hypertrophication''', is when a body of water becomes overly enriched with minerals and nutrients that induce excessive growth of plants and algae.&lt;ref name=Chislock&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chislock, M.F.|last2=Doster, E.|last3=Zitomer, R.A.|last4=Wilson, A.E.|title=Eutrophication: Causes, Consequences, and Controls in Aquatic Ecosystems|journal=Nature Education Knowledge|date=2013|volume=4|issue=4|page=10|url=https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/eutrophication-causes-consequences-and-controls-in-aquatic-102364466|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process may result in oxygen depletion of the water body.&lt;ref&gt;Schindler, David and Vallentyne, John R. (2004) ''Over fertilization of the World's Freshwaters and Estuaries'', University of Alberta Press, p. 1, {{ISBN|0-88864-484-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the "bloom" or great increase of [[phytoplankton]] in a water body as a response to increased levels of nutrients. Eutrophication is almost always induced by the discharge of nitrate or phosphate-containing [[detergent]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, or [[sewage]] into an aquatic system.

==Mechanism of eutrophication==
Eutrophication arises from the oversupply of nutrients, which leads to overgrowth of plants and algae. After such organisms die, the bacterial degradation of their biomass consumes the oxygen in the water, thereby creating the state of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]].

According to Ullmann's Encyclopedia, "the primary limiting factor for eutrophication is phosphate."  The availability of phosphorus generally promotes excessive plant growth and decay, favouring simple algae and plankton over other more complicated plants, and causes a severe reduction in water quality. Phosphorus is a necessary nutrient for plants to live, and is the limiting factor for plant growth in many freshwater ecosystems.  Phosphate adheres tightly to soil, so it is mainly transported by erosion. Once translocated to lakes, the extraction of phosphate into water is slow, hence the difficulty of reversing the effects of eutrophication.&lt;ref name=Nasir&gt;Khan, M. Nasir and Mohammad, F. (2014 ) "Eutrophication of Lakes" in A. A. Ansari, S. S. Gill (eds.), ''Eutrophication: Challenges and Solutions''; Volume II of ''Eutrophication: Causes, Consequences and Control'', Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. {{DOI|10.1007/978-94-007-7814-6_5}}. {{ISBN|978-94-007-7814-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, numerous literature report that nitrogen is the primary limiting nutrient for the accumulation of algal biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4354503|doi=10.1663/0006-8101(2005)071[0449:EAEV]2.0.CO;2|year=2005|volume=71|issue=4|pages=449–482|title=Eutrophication: An Ecological Vision|journal=Botanical Review|last1=Khan|first1=Fareed A.|last2=Ansari|first2=Abid Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sources of these excess phosphates are [[phosphates in detergent]], industrial/domestic run-offs, and fertilizers.  With the phasing out of phosphate-containing detergents in the 1970s, industrial/domestic run-off and agriculture have emerged as the dominant contributors to eutrophication.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Wilfried (2002) "Fertilizers, 6. Environmental Aspects". ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.n10_n05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Sodium tripolyphosphate.svg|thumb|left|[[Sodium triphosphate]], once a component of many detergents, was a major contributor to eutrophication.]]

[[File:Eutrophicationmodel.svg|thumb|1. Excess nutrients are applied to the soil.  2. Some nutrients leach into the soil where they can remain for years. Eventually, they get drained into the water body.  3. Some nutrients run off over the ground into the body of water.  4. The excess nutrients cause an algal bloom.  5. The algal bloom blocks the light of the sun from reaching the bottom of the water body. 6. The plants beneath the algal bloom die because they cannot get sunlight to photosynthesize.  7. Eventually, the algal bloom dies and sinks to the bottom of the lake. Bacteria begins to decompose the remains, using up oxygen for respiration.  8. The decomposition causes the water to become depleted of oxygen. Larger life forms, such as fish, suffocate to death. This body of water can no longer support life.]]

===Cultural eutrophication===
{{main|Cultural eutrophication}}
Cultural eutrophication is the process that speeds up natural eutrophication because of human activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/146210/cultural-eutrophication Cultural eutrophication] (2010) ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved April 26, 2010, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online:&lt;/ref&gt; Due to clearing of land and building of towns and cities, [[Surface runoff|land runoff]] is accelerated and more nutrients such as [[phosphate]]s and [[nitrate]] are supplied to lakes and rivers, and then to coastal [[estuary|estuaries]] and bays. Extra nutrients are also supplied by treatment plants, golf courses, fertilizers, farms (including fish farms), as well as untreated sewage in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;Schindler, David W., Vallentyne, John R. (2008). ''The Algal Bowl: Overfertilization of the World's Freshwaters and Estuaries'', University of Alberta Press, {{ISBN|0-88864-484-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lakes and rivers===
[[File:Orange like Autumn.jpg|thumb|Eutrophication in a canal]]
When algae die, they decompose and the nutrients contained in that organic matter are converted into inorganic form by microorganisms. This decomposition process consumes oxygen, which reduces the concentration of dissolved oxygen.  The depleted oxygen levels in turn may lead to [[fish kill]]s and a range of other effects reducing biodiversity. Nutrients may become concentrated in an anoxic zone and may only be made available again during autumn turn-over or in conditions of turbulent flow.

Enhanced growth of aquatic vegetation or [[phytoplankton]] and [[algal bloom]]s disrupts normal functioning of the ecosystem, causing a variety of problems such as a lack of [[oxygen]] needed for fish and [[shellfish]] to survive. The water becomes cloudy, typically coloured a shade of green, yellow, brown, or red. Eutrophication also decreases the value of rivers, lakes and aesthetic enjoyment. Health problems can occur where [[eutrophic]] conditions interfere with drinking [[water treatment]].&lt;ref name="Bartram 1999"&gt;Bartram, J., Wayne W. Carmichael, Ingrid Chorus, Gary Jones, and Olav M. Skulberg (1999) Chapter 1. Introduction, in: ''Toxic Cyanobacteria in Water: A guide to their public health consequences, monitoring and management''. [[World Health Organization]]. URL: [http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/resourcesquality/toxicyanbact/en/ WHO document] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124215138/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/resourcesquality/toxicyanbact/en/ |date=2007-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human activities can accelerate the rate at which nutrients enter [[ecosystem]]s. Runoff from [[agriculture]] and development, pollution from [[septic system]]s and [[sanitary sewer|sewers]], [[sewage sludge]] spreading, and other human-related activities increase the flow of both inorganic nutrients and organic substances into ecosystems. Elevated levels of atmospheric compounds of [[nitrogen]] can increase nitrogen availability. [[Phosphorus]] is often regarded as the main culprit in cases of eutrophication in lakes subjected to "point source" pollution from sewage pipes. The concentration of algae and the trophic state of lakes correspond well to phosphorus levels in water. Studies conducted in the Experimental Lakes Area in Ontario have shown a relationship between the addition of phosphorus and the rate of eutrophication. Humankind has increased the rate of [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus cycling]] on Earth by four times, mainly due to agricultural fertilizer production and application. Between 1950 and 1995, an estimated 600,000,000 [[tonne]]s of phosphorus was applied to Earth's surface, primarily on croplands.&lt;ref name="Carpenter, S.R. 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carpenter | first1 = S.R. | last2 = Caraco | first2 = N.F. | last3 = Smith | first3 = V.H. | year = 1998 | title = Nonpoint pollution of surface waters with phosphorus and nitrogen | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/1051-0761(1998)008[0559:NPOSWW]2.0.CO;2/pdf | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 559–568 | doi = 10.2307/2641247 | jstor = 2641247 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy changes to control point sources of phosphorus have resulted in rapid control of eutrophication.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Natural eutrophication===&lt;!--pretty specialised--&gt;
Although eutrophication is commonly caused by human activities, it can also be a natural process, particularly in lakes. Eutrophy occurs in many lakes in temperate grasslands, for instance. [[paleolimnology|Paleolimnologists]] now recognise that climate change, geology, and other external influences are critical in regulating the natural productivity of lakes. Some lakes also demonstrate the reverse process ([[meiotrophication]]), becoming less nutrient rich with time.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, I. R. (2006) "Chironomid overview", pp. 360–366 in S.A. EIias (ed.) ''Encyclopedia of Quaternary Science'', Vol. 1, Elsevier,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Whiteside | first1 = M.

===Ocean waters===
Eutrophication is a common phenomenon in coastal waters. In contrast to freshwater systems, nitrogen is more commonly the key limiting nutrient of marine waters; thus, [[nitrogen]] levels have greater importance to understanding eutrophication problems in salt water. [[Estuary|Estuaries]] tend to be naturally eutrophic because land-derived nutrients are concentrated where run-off enters a confined channel. Upwelling in coastal systems also promotes increased productivity by conveying deep, nutrient-rich waters to the surface, where the nutrients can be assimilated by [[algae]]. Examples of anthropogenic sources of nitrogen-rich pollution include seacage [[fish farming]] and discharges of [[ammonia]] from the production of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] from coal.

The [[World Resources Institute]] has identified 375 hypoxic coastal zones in the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly Japan.&lt;ref&gt;
Selman, Mindy (2007) ''Eutrophication: An Overview of Status, Trends, Policies, and Strategies.'' World Resources Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to runoff from land, fish farming wastes and industrial ammonia discharges, atmospheric [[Nitrogen fixation|fixed nitrogen]] can enter the open ocean. A study in 2008 found that this could account for around one third of the ocean's external (non-recycled) nitrogen supply, and up to 3% of the annual new marine biological production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duce | first1 = R A | display-authors = etal   | year = 2008 | title = Impacts of Atmospheric Anthropogenic Nitrogen on the Open Ocean | url = | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5878| pages = 893–89 | doi=10.1126/science.1150369 | pmid=18487184| bibcode = 2008Sci...320..893D}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that accumulating reactive nitrogen in the environment may prove as serious as putting carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-05/uov-at051208.php ''Addressing the nitrogen cascade''] Eureka Alert, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terrestrial ecosystems==
Terrestrial ecosystems are subject to similarly adverse impacts from eutrophication.&lt;ref name="APIS 2005"&gt;APIS (2005) [http://www.apis.ac.uk/overview/issues/overview_eutrophication.htm Air Pollution Information System].&lt;/ref&gt; Increased [[nitrate]]s in soil are frequently undesirable for plants. Many terrestrial plant species are endangered as a result of soil eutrophication, such as the majority of [[orchid]] species in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Pullin |first= Andrew S. |title= Conservation biology |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-521-64482-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meadows, forests, and [[bog]]s are characterized by low nutrient content and slowly growing species adapted to those levels, so they can be overgrown by faster growing and more competitive species. In meadows, tall grasses that can take advantage of higher nitrogen levels may change the area so that natural species may be lost. Species-rich [[fen]]s can be overtaken by [[reed (plant)|reed]] or [[reedgrass]] species. Forest [[undergrowth]] affected by run-off from a nearby fertilized field can be turned into a [[nettle]] and [[bramble]] thicket.

Chemical forms of nitrogen are most often of concern with regard to eutrophication, because plants have high nitrogen requirements so that additions of nitrogen compounds will stimulate plant growth. Nitrogen is not readily available in soil because N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a gaseous form of nitrogen, is very stable and unavailable directly to higher plants. Terrestrial ecosystems rely on [[microbe|microbial]] [[nitrogen fixation]] to convert N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into other forms such as [[nitrate]]s. However, there is a limit to how much nitrogen can be utilized. Ecosystems receiving more nitrogen than the plants require are called nitrogen-saturated. Saturated terrestrial ecosystems then can contribute both inorganic and organic nitrogen to freshwater, coastal, and marine eutrophication, where nitrogen is also typically a [[Limiting factor|limiting nutrient]].&lt;ref name="Hornung 1995"&gt;Hornung M., Sutton M.A. and Wilson R.B. [Eds.] (1995): Mapping and modelling of critical loads for nitrogen&amp;nbsp;— a workshop report. Grange-over-Sands, Cumbria, UK. UN-ECE Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution, Working Group for Effects, 24–26 October 1994. Published by: Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, Edinburgh, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the case with increased levels of phosphorus. However, because [[phosphorus]] is generally much less [[soluble]] than nitrogen, it is [[Leaching (agriculture)|leached]] from the soil at a much slower rate than nitrogen. Consequently, [[phosphorus]] is much more important as a limiting nutrient in aquatic systems.&lt;ref name="Smith 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Ecological effects==
[[Image:Caspian Sea from orbit.jpg|thumb|Eutrophication is apparent as increased [[turbidity]] in the northern part of the [[Caspian Sea]], imaged from orbit.]]

Many ecological effects can arise from stimulating [[primary production]], but there are three particularly troubling ecological impacts: decreased biodiversity, changes in species composition and dominance, and toxicity effects.
* Increased biomass of [[phytoplankton]]
* Toxic or inedible phytoplankton species
* Increases in blooms of gelatinous [[zooplankton]]
* Increased [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of [[benthic]] and [[epiphytic]] [[algae]]
* Changes in [[macrophyte]] species composition and [[biomass]]
* Decreases in water transparency (increased [[turbidity]])
* Colour, smell, and water treatment problems
* [[Oxygen saturation|Dissolved oxygen]] depletion
* Increased incidences of [[fish kill]]s
* Loss of desirable fish species
* Reductions in harvestable fish and [[shellfish]]
* Decreases in perceived aesthetic value of the water body

===Decreased biodiversity===
When an ecosystem experiences an increase in nutrients, [[primary producer]]s reap the benefits first. In aquatic ecosystems, species such as [[algae]] experience a population increase (called an [[algal bloom]]). Algal blooms limit the sunlight available to bottom-dwelling organisms and cause wide swings in the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water.
Oxygen is required by all aerobically [[Respiration (physiology)|respiring]] plants and animals and it is replenished in daylight by [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] plants and algae. Under eutrophic conditions, dissolved oxygen greatly increases during the day, but is greatly reduced after dark by the respiring algae and by microorganisms that feed on the increasing mass of dead algae. When dissolved oxygen levels decline to [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] levels, fish and other marine animals suffocate. As a result, creatures such as fish, shrimp, and especially immobile bottom dwellers die off.&lt;ref name="Horrigan 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal

{{see also|biodiversity}}

===New species invasion===
Eutrophication may cause competitive release by making abundant a normally [[Limiting factor|limiting nutrient]]. This process causes shifts in the species composition of ecosystems. For instance, an increase in nitrogen might allow new, [[invasive species|competitive species]] to invade and out-compete original inhabitant species. This has been shown to occur&lt;ref name="Bertness 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.022447299|pmc=122201|jstor=3057772|year=2002|author1=Bertness|first1=M.

In Europe and Asia, the [[common carp]] frequently lives in naturally Eutrophic or Hypereutrophic areas, and is adapted to living in such conditions. The eutrophication of areas outside its natural range partially explain the fish's success in colonising these areas after being introduced.

===Toxicity===
Some [[algal bloom]]s, otherwise called "nuisance algae" or "harmful algal blooms", are [[toxic]] to plants and animals. Toxic compounds can make their way up the [[food chain]], resulting in animal mortality.&lt;ref name="Anderson 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anderson D.

In order to gauge how to best prevent eutrophication from occurring, specific sources that contribute to nutrient loading must be identified. There are two common sources of nutrients and organic matter: point and [[Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint]] sources.

===Point sources===
[[Point source (pollution)|Point sources]] are directly attributable to one influence. In point sources the nutrient waste travels directly from source to water. Point sources are relatively easy to regulate.

===Nonpoint sources===
Nonpoint source pollution (also known as 'diffuse' or 'runoff' pollution) is that which comes from ill-defined and diffuse sources. Nonpoint sources are difficult to regulate and usually vary spatially and temporally (with [[season]], [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], and other [[act of god|irregular events]]).

It has been shown that nitrogen transport is correlated with various indices of human activity in watersheds,&lt;ref name="Cole 1993"&gt;Cole J.J., B.L. Peierls, N.F. Caraco, and M.L. Pace.

There are three reasons that nonpoint sources are especially troublesome:&lt;ref name="Smith 1999"/&gt;

====Soil retention====
Nutrients from human activities tend to accumulate in [[soil]]s and remain there for years. It has been shown&lt;ref name="Sharpley 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Sharpley AN, Daniel TC, Sims JT, Pote DH |year= 1996|title= Determining environmentally sound soil phosphorus levels|journal= Journal of Soil and Water Conservation |volume=51|pages=160–166|url=http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/20713/PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the amount of [[phosphorus]] lost to surface waters increases linearly with the amount of phosphorus in the soil. Thus much of the nutrient loading in soil eventually makes its way to water. Nitrogen, similarly, has a [[turnover time]] of decades.

====Runoff to surface water====
Nutrients from human activities tend to travel from land to either surface or ground water. Nitrogen in particular is removed through [[storm drains]], sewage pipes, and other forms of [[surface runoff]].
Nutrient losses in runoff and [[leachate]] are often associated with [[agriculture]]. Modern agriculture often involves the application of nutrients onto fields in order to maximise production. However, farmers frequently apply more nutrients than are taken up by crops&lt;ref name="Buol 1995"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buol | first1 = S. W. | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.26.110195.000325 | title = Sustainability of Soil Use | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 26 | pages = 25–44| year = 1995 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or pastures. Regulations aimed at minimising nutrient exports from agriculture are typically far less stringent than those placed on sewage treatment plants&lt;ref name="Carpenter, S.R. 1998"/&gt; and other point source polluters. It should be also noted that lakes within forested land are also under surface runoff influences. Runoff can wash out the mineral nitrogen and phosphorus from detritus and in consequence supply the water bodies leading to slow, natural eutrophication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Klimaszyk, P.  |author2=Rzymski, P.|title= Surface Runoff as a Factor Determining Trophic State of Midforest Lake|journal= Polish Journal of Environmental Studies|year= 2010|volume= 20|issue=5|pages= 1203–1210|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51986191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atmospheric deposition====
Nitrogen is released into the air because of [[ammonia]] [[volatilization]] and nitrous oxide production. The [[combustion]] of [[fossil fuels]] is a large human-initiated contributor to atmospheric nitrogen pollution. Atmospheric nitrogen reaches the ground by two different processes, the first being wet deposition such as rain or snow, and the second being dry deposition which is particles and gases found in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critical Loads – Atmospheric Deposition|url=https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/airqualityportal/critical_loads/atmospheric_deposition.php|website=U.S Forest Service|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atmospheric deposition (e.g., in the form of [[acid rain]]) can also affect nutrient concentration in water,&lt;ref name="Paerl 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paerl H. W.|year=1997|title=Coastal Eutrophication and Harmful Algal Blooms: Importance of Atmospheric Deposition and Groundwater as "New" Nitrogen and Other Nutrient Sources|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|volume=42|pages=1154–1165|url=http://www.aslo.org/lo/pdf/vol_42/issue_5pt2/1154.pdf|doi=10.4319/lo.1997.42.5_part_2.1154|issue=5_part_2|bibcode=1997LimOc..42.1154P}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in highly industrialized regions.

===Other causes===
Any factor that causes increased nutrient concentrations can potentially lead to eutrophication. In modeling eutrophication, the rate of water renewal plays a critical role; [[stagnant water]] is allowed to collect more nutrients than bodies with replenished water supplies. It has also been shown that the drying of [[wetlands]] causes an increase in nutrient concentration and subsequent eutrophication blooms.&lt;ref name="Mungall 1991"&gt;Mungall C. and McLaren, D.J. (1991) Planet under stress: the challenge of global change. Oxford University Press, New York, New York, USA, {{ISBN|0-19-540731-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention and reversal==
Eutrophication poses a problem not only to [[ecosystem]]s, but to humans as well. Reducing eutrophication should be a key concern when considering future policy, and a [[sustainable agriculture|sustainable solution]] for everyone, including farmers and ranchers, seems feasible. While eutrophication does pose problems, humans should be aware that natural runoff (which causes algal blooms in the wild) is common in ecosystems and should thus not reverse nutrient concentrations beyond normal levels. Cleanup measures have been mostly, but not completely, successful. [[Finland|Finnish]] phosphorus removal measures started in the mid-1970s and have targeted rivers and lakes polluted by industrial and municipal discharges. These efforts have had a 90% removal efficiency.&lt;ref name="Raike 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Shellfish in estuaries: unique solutions===
One proposed solution to eutrophication in estuaries is to restore shellfish populations, such as [[oysters]] and [[mussels]]. Oyster reefs remove [[nitrogen]] from the water column and filter out suspended solids, subsequently reducing the likelihood or extent of [[harmful algal blooms]] or anoxic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeger, Timm (2012) [http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/oyster-restoration-study-kroeger.pdf Dollars and Sense: Economic Benefits and Impacts from two Oyster Reef Restoration Projects in the Northern Gulf of Mexico] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002313/http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/oyster-restoration-study-kroeger.pdf# |date=2016-03-04 }}.

===Minimizing nonpoint pollution: future work===
Nonpoint pollution is the most difficult source of nutrients to manage. The literature suggests, though, that when these sources are controlled, eutrophication decreases. The following steps are recommended to minimize the amount of pollution that can enter aquatic ecosystems from ambiguous sources.

====Riparian buffer zones====
Studies show that intercepting non-point pollution between the source and the water is a successful means of prevention.&lt;ref name="Carpenter, S.R. 1998"/&gt; [[riparian|Riparian buffer zones]] are interfaces between a flowing body of water and land, and have been created near waterways in an attempt to filter pollutants; [[sediment]] and nutrients are deposited here instead of in water. Creating buffer zones near farms and roads is another possible way to prevent nutrients from traveling too far. Still, studies have shown&lt;ref name="Agnold 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Angold P. G. |year=1997|title= The Impact of a Road Upon Adjacent Heathland Vegetation: Effects on Plant Species Composition|journal= The Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=34|pages=409–417|jstor=2404886|doi=10.2307/2404886|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the effects of atmospheric nitrogen pollution can reach far past the buffer zone. This suggests that the most effective means of prevention is from the primary source.

====Prevention policy====
Laws regulating the discharge and [[treatment of sewage]] have led to dramatic nutrient reductions to surrounding ecosystems,&lt;ref name="Smith 1999"/&gt; but it is generally agreed that a policy regulating agricultural use of [[fertilizer]] and animal waste must be imposed. In Japan the amount of nitrogen produced by livestock is adequate to serve the fertilizer needs for the agriculture industry.&lt;ref name="Kumazawa 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kumazawa | first1 = K. | journal = Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems | volume = 63 | issue = 2/3 | pages = 129–137 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021198721003 |title=Nitrogen fertilization and nitrate pollution in groundwater in Japan: Present status and measures for sustainable agriculture| year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is not unreasonable to command livestock owners to clean up animal waste—which when left stagnant will [[Leaching (pedology)|leach]] into ground water.

Policy concerning the prevention and reduction of eutrophication can be broken down into four sectors: Technologies, public participation, economic instruments, and cooperation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.unep.or.jp/ietc/Publications/TechPublications/TechPub-11/ "Planning and Management of Lakes and Reservoirs: An Integrated Approach to Eutrophication."] United Nations Environment Programme, Newsletter and Technical Publications. International Environmental Technology Centre. Ch.3.4 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The term technology is used loosely, referring to a more widespread use of existing methods rather than an appropriation of new technologies. As mentioned before, nonpoint sources of pollution are the primary contributors to eutrophication, and their effects can be easily minimized through common agricultural practices. Reducing the amount of pollutants that reach a watershed can be achieved through the protection of its forest cover, reducing the amount of erosion leeching into a watershed. Also, through the efficient, controlled use of land using sustainable agricultural practices to minimize land degradation, the amount of soil runoff and nitrogen-based fertilizers reaching a watershed can be reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Oglesby, R. T.  |author2=Edmondson, W. T. |title=Control of Eutrophication|journal= Journal (Water Pollution Control Federation)|volume= 38|issue= 9 |year=1966|pages= 1452–1460|jstor=25035632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste disposal technology constitutes another factor in eutrophication prevention. Because a major contributor to the nonpoint source nutrient loading of water bodies is untreated domestic sewage, it is necessary to provide treatment facilities to highly urbanized areas, particularly those in underdeveloped nations, in which treatment of domestic waste water is a scarcity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Middlebrooks, E. J. |author2=Pearson, E. A. |author3=Tunzi, M. |author4=Adinarayana, A. |author5=McGauhey, P. H. |author6=Rohlich, G. A. |title=Eutrophication of Surface Water: Lake Tahoe|jstor=25036890|journal=Journal (Water Pollution Control Federation)|volume= 43|issue= 2|year= 1971|pages= 242–251}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology to safely and efficiently reuse waste water, both from domestic and industrial sources, should be a primary concern for policy regarding eutrophication.

The role of the public is a major factor for the effective prevention of eutrophication. In order for a policy to have any effect, the public must be aware of their contribution to the problem, and ways in which they can reduce their effects. Programs instituted to promote participation in the recycling and elimination of wastes, as well as education on the issue of rational water use are necessary to protect water quality within urbanized areas and adjacent water bodies.

Economic instruments, "which include, among others, property rights, water markets, fiscal and financial instruments, charge systems and liability systems, are gradually becoming a substantive component of the management tool set used for pollution control and water allocation decisions."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Incentives for those who practice clean, renewable, water management technologies are an effective means of encouraging pollution prevention. By internalizing the costs associated with the negative effects on the environment, governments are able to encourage a cleaner water management.

Because a body of water can have an effect on a range of people reaching far beyond that of the watershed, cooperation between different organizations is necessary to prevent the intrusion of contaminants that can lead to eutrophication. Agencies ranging from state governments to those of water resource management and non-governmental organizations, going as low as the local population, are responsible for preventing eutrophication of water bodies. In the United States, the most well known inter-state effort to prevent eutrophication is the [[Chesapeake Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150111125613/http://dnr.state.md.us/bay/monitoring/limit/index.html Nutrient Limitation]. Department of Natural Resources, Maryland, U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nitrogen testing and modeling====
Soil Nitrogen Testing (N-Testing) is a technique that helps farmers optimize the amount of fertilizer applied to crops. By testing fields with this method, farmers saw a decrease in fertilizer application costs, a decrease in nitrogen lost to surrounding sources, or both.&lt;ref name="Huang 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|year= 2001|title= An assessment of soil nitrogen testing considering the carry-over effect|journal= Applied Mathematical Modelling |volume=25|pages=843–860|url=http://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/15633/PDF|doi=10.1016/S0307-904X(98)10001-X|issue=10|last1= Huang|first1= Wen-Yuan|last2= Lu|first2= Yao-chi|last3= Uri|first3= Noel D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By testing the soil and modeling the bare minimum amount of fertilizer are needed, farmers reap economic benefits while reducing pollution.

====Organic farming====
There has been a study that found that organically fertilized fields "significantly reduce harmful nitrate leaching" over conventionally fertilized fields.&lt;ref name='PNAS 2006-3-21'&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0600359103|bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.4522K | title = Reduced nitrate leaching and enhanced denitrifier activity and efficiency in organically fertilized soils | year = 2006 | last1 = Kramer | first1 = S. B. | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 103 | issue = 12 | pages = 4522–4527 | pmid=16537377 | pmc=1450204}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more recent study found that eutrophication impacts are in some cases higher from organic
production than they are from conventional production.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, A.G., Audsley, E. and Sandars, D.L. (2006) [http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Module=More&amp;Location=None&amp;ProjectID=11442 Determining the environmental burdens and resource use in the production of agricultural and horticultural commodities]. Main Report. Defra Research Project IS0205. Bedford: Cranfield University and Defra.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dredging===
Dredging helps in reduction of [[soil contamination]] that was caused by [[sewage sludge]] (like [[septage|fecal sludge]]), wilted plants, or chemical spill.

===Bokashi===

Bokashi is a modern method of eutrophication prevention to decrease smell and toxic materials. Bokashi (ぼかし) is Japanese for "shading off" or "gradation." It derives from the practice of [[Japan]]ese farmers centuries ago of covering food waste with rich, local soil that contained the microorganisms that would ferment the waste. After a few weeks, they would bury the waste.&lt;ref name=lindsay&gt;{{cite news|last=Lindsay|first=Jay|title=Japanese composting may be new food waste solution|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/japanese-composting-may-be-new-food-waste-solution|accessdate=13 November 2012|newspaper=AP|date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=news report from 2012 does not count as a good source for these claims|date=August 2015}} Bokashi balls used in water pollution are made up of soil (either clay or loam or mixture of both), water, molasses, and antimicrobial solution; antimicrobial solution is used to kill germs (either bacteria or fungi), that cause foul odor, and algae.

[[Image:fmrockc.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An element of rock under stress]]

'''Fault mechanics''' is a field of study that investigates the behavior of [[geologic fault]]s.

Behind every good [[earthquake]] is some weak rock.  Whether the rock remains weak becomes an important point in determining the potential for bigger earthquakes.

On a small scale, fractured rock behaves essentially the same throughout the world, in that the [[angle of friction]] is more or less uniform (see [[Fault friction]]).  A small element of rock in a larger mass responds to [[stress (physics)|stress]] changes in a well defined manner:  if it is squeezed by differential stresses greater than its strength, it is capable of large deformations.  A band of weak, fractured rock in a competent mass can deform to resemble a classic [[geologic fault]].  Using [[seismometer]]s and [[earthquake location]], the requisite pattern of micro-earthquakes can be observed.

[[Image:fmcracks.jpg|Penny|left|thumb|200px|Penny-shape cracks in rock]]

For earthquakes, it all starts with an embedded [[penny]]-shaped crack as first envisioned by Brune.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1987/A1987J040600001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  As illustrated, an earthquake zone may start as a single crack, growing to form many individual cracks and collections of cracks along a fault.  The key to fault growth is the concept of a "following force", as conveniently provided for [[interplate earthquake]]s, by the motion of tectonic plates.  Under a following force, the seismic displacements eventually form a topographic feature, such as a mountain range.

[[File:Fault mechanics creating a ridge.jpg|ridge|right|thumb|200px|Following forces forming a mountain range]]

[[Intraplate earthquakes]] do not have a following force, and are not associated with mountain building.  Thus, there is the puzzling question of how long any interior active zone has to live.  For, in a solid stressed plate, every seismic displacement acts to relieve (reduce) stress; the fault zone should come to equilibrium; and all seismic activity cease.  One can see this type of arching "lockup" in many natural processes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exploratorium.edu/ronh/adventure/arches.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, the [[seismic zone]] (such as the [[New Madrid Fault Zone]]) is ensured eternal life by the action of water.  As shown, if we add the equivalent of a giant funnel to the crack, it becomes the beneficiary of stress corrosion (the progressive weakening of the crack edge by water).&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20051217222420/http://www.nire.go.jp/annual/1998/28.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  If there is a continuing supply of new water, the system does not come to equilibrium, but continues to grow, ever relieving stress from a larger and larger volume.

[[Image:fmwater.jpg|water|left|thumb|200px| Fresh water continually being injected]]

Thus the prerequisite for a continuing seismically active interior zone is the presence of water, the ability of the water to get down to the fault source (high [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]]), and the usual high horizontal interior stresses of the rock mass.  All small earthquake zones have the potential to grow to resemble New Madrid or [[Charlevoix]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''{{lang|de|Gesellschaft der Freunde alter Musikinstrumente}}''' ('''GEFAM''') (''Society of friends of old [[musical instruments]]'') was founded in 1951 in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, by a number of music lovers and collectors of historical musical instruments. It is still the only society in the German speaking part of Europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Lichtenstein) that is concerned mainly with old musical instruments. Thanks to its base in Switzerland it has a multicultural and multilanguage profile, visual in its international list of members. Today there are around 200 members (individuals and institutions), mainly in Europe, but also on other parts of the globe. The spectrum includes specialised museums and collections of old musical instruments, researchers and instrument makers as well as private collectors and enthusiasts.

The society is a forum in which public and private collections of musical instruments are visited and aspects of conservation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/musik-und-artenschutz-im-clinch-1.18435496&lt;/ref&gt; are discussed, whereby the history of the musical instruments is given special consideration. Occasionally extra-European instruments are regarded as well. In addition to these aspects the society also contributes to discussions between [[museum]] "[[Expert|specialists]]"&lt;!-- what is being quoted here? --&gt;{{cn|date=August 2015}}, [[Musical instrument|instrument makers]], [[universities]] and [[Music school|conservatories]] on the one hand and [[Private collection|private collectors]] and others interested in old musical instruments on the other.

==Publications==

The society publishes the biannual bulletin ''[[Glareana]]'' ([http://www.gefam.ch/en/glareana_en/ eJournal])&lt;ref&gt;Imogen Fellinger, et al. "Periodicals." Grove Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 12 Aug. 2015. &lt;http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/21338pg41&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with society news and articles on subjects pertaining to instruments. It has also published several [[monograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gefam.ch/en/publications/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6107">'''Hydric soil''' is [[soil]] which is permanently or seasonally saturated by water, resulting in [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] conditions, as found in [[wetland]]s.

== Overview ==

Most [[soil]]s are [[Wikt:aerobic|aerobic]].  This is important because [[plant]] roots respire (that is, they consume [[oxygen]] and [[carbohydrates]] while releasing [[carbon dioxide]]) and there must be sufficient air—especially oxygen—in the soil to support most forms of [[soil life]].  Air normally moves through interconnected [[porosity|pores]] by forces such as changes in [[atmospheric pressure]], the flushing action of rainwater, and by simple [[diffusion]].

In addition to plant [[root]]s, most forms of soil [[microorganisms]] need oxygen to survive. This is true of the more well-known soil animals as well, such as [[ants]], [[earthworms]] and [[Mole (animal)|moles]]. But soils can often become saturated with water due to rainfall and flooding.  [[soil gas|Gas diffusion in soil]] slows (some 10,000 times slower) when soil becomes saturated with water because there are no open passageways for air to travel.  When oxygen levels become limited, intense competition arises between soil life forms for the remaining oxygen.  When this anaerobic environment continues for long periods during the growing season, quite different biological and chemical reactions begin to dominate, compared with aerobic soils.  In soils where saturation with water is prolonged and is repeated for many years, unique soil properties usually develop that can be recognized in the field.  Soils with these unique properties are called hydric soils, and although they may occupy a relatively small portion of the landscape, they maintain important functions in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Schuyt, K. and Brander, L. 2004.

The plants found in hydric soils often have [[aerenchyma]], internal spaces in stems and rhizomes, that allow atmospheric oxygen to be transported to the rooting zone.&lt;ref&gt;Justin, S. H. F. W. and Armstrong, W. 1987. The anatomical characteristics of roots and plant response to soil flooding.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; common examples include cattails, sedges and water-lilies.

== Technical definitions ==

=== United States ===

A hydric soil is defined by federal law&lt;ref&gt;Food Security Act(FSA) of 1985 16 U.S.C. Section 3801(a)(2)&lt;/ref&gt; to mean "soil that, in its undrained condition, is saturated, flooded, or ponded long enough during a growing season to develop an anerobic condition that supports the growth and regeneration of hydrophytic vegetation".  This term is part of the legal definition of a [[wetland]] included in the [[United States]] [[Food Security Act of 1985]] (P.L. 99-198). This definition is provided in the controlling regulations to the Wetland Conservation Provisions of the FSA of 1985(7 C.F.R 12) and is used by the U.S.D.A. Natural Resources Conservation Service in the administration of the Wetland Conservation Compliance provisions ("Swampbuster") contained in the FSA of 1985.   In adopting this definition in 1985, Congress attempted to capture the duration of waterlogged condition of a hydric soil by adding that a hydric soil is waterlogged long enough to support not only the growth of plants adapted to life in anaerobic conditions but also the regeneration of such plants.

Another common definition of a hydric soils is provided by the National Technical Committee of Hydric Soils (NTCHS) as "a soil that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or [[ponding]] long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part."&lt;ref&gt;This definition  (Federal Register, July 13, 1994) replaced the older 1991 version and accomplished two things. First, a soil that is artificially drained or protected (ditches, levees, etc.) is a hydric soil if the soil in its undisturbed state meets the definition of a hydric soil. Estimated soil properties for manipulated soils are based on best professional estimates of the properties thought to exist before manipulation. Second, the link between the definition and criteria was removed.&lt;/ref&gt; The NTCHS hydric soil definition is used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency in their joint responsibilities in the administration of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (1972).

'''''Laboratory Life: The Construction of Scientific Facts''''' is a 1979 book by [[Sociology of science|sociologists of science]] [[Bruno Latour]] and [[Steve Woolgar]].

This influential book in the field of [[science studies]] presents an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] study of [[Roger Guillemin]]'s scientific laboratory at the [[Salk Institute]]. It advances a number of observations regarding how scientific work is conducted, including descriptions of the complex relationship between the routine lab practices performed by scientists, the publication of papers, scientific prestige, research finances and other elements of laboratory life.

The book is considered to be one of the most influential works in the laboratory studies tradition within [[Science and Technology Studies]]. It is inspired but not entirely dependent on the [[Ethnomethodology|ethnomethodological]] approach.  In turn, it served as the inspiration for [[Actor-Network Theory]] (or ANT); many of ANT's core concepts (like transcription, inscription, translation, and the deployment of networks) are present in ''Laboratory Life''.

==Introduction and Methodology==
Latour and Woolgar state that their work "concerns the way in which the daily activities of working scientists lead to the construction of scientific facts" (40).  ''Laboratory Life'' therefore stands in opposition to the study of scandalous moments in which the so-called "normal" operation of science was disrupted by external forces.  In contrast, Latour and Woolgar give an account of a how scientific facts are produced in a laboratory ''[[in situ]]'', or as it happens.

==An Anthropologist Visits the Laboratory==
The initial [[methodology]] of ''Laboratory Life'' involves an "[[anthropology|anthropological]] strangeness" (40) in which the laboratory is a [[tribe]] foreign to the researcher.  The study of the lab begins with a semi-fictionalized account of an ignorant observer who knows nothing of laboratories or scientists.  In this account, Latour and Woolgar "bracket" (44) their previous knowledge of scientific practice and [[irony|ironic]]ally ask seemingly-nonsensical questions about observed practices in the laboratory, such as "Are the heated debates in front of the blackboard part of some [[gambling]] contest?"  In the asking and answering of these questions, the observer's understanding of laboratory practices is gradually refined, leading to a strong focus on the significance of paper [[document]]s.

The observer soon recognizes that all the scientists and technicians in the lab [[writing|write]] in some fashion, and that few activities in the lab are not connected to some sort of [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] or [[inscription]]. The foreign observer describes the laboratory as "strange tribe" of "compulsive and [[mania|manic]] writers ... who spend the greatest part of their day coding, marking, altering, correcting, reading, and writing" (48-9).  Large and expensive laboratory equipment (such as [[bioassay]]s or [[mass spectrometer]]s) are interpreted as "inscription device[s]" that have the sole purpose of "transform[ing] a material substance into a figure or [[diagram]]" (51).  In this way, the observer works to organize and systematize the laboratory such that it "began to take on the appearance of a system of literary inscription" (52).

Having concluded that the "production of papers" for publication in a [[scientific journal]] is the primary focus of a laboratory, the observer next aims to "consider papers as objects in much the same way as [[manufactured goods]]" (71).  This involves asking how papers are produced, what their [[constituent element]]s (or [[raw material]]s) are, and why these papers are so important.  First, the authors recognize that in papers, "some statements appeared more [[fact]]-like than others" (76).  From this observation, a five-element [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] of [[facticity]] is constructed, which spans from type 5 statements which are taken for granted to type 1 statements which are unqualified speculations, with various intermediate levels in between.  The conclusion reached is that statements in a laboratory routinely travel up and down this continuum, and the main purpose of a laboratory is to take statements of one level of facticity and transform them to another level.

However, Latour and Woolgar recognize that this semi-fictionalized account of an ignorant observer aiming to systematize the alien laboratory has several problems.  While the observer's rich descriptions of activity in the lab are taken as accurate, the observer has not established that the interpretation of this data in terms of literary inscription is exhaustive or the only way in which laboratory life can be analyzed.  In the authors' words, the observer's account is not "immune from all possibility of future qualification" (88).

==The Construction of a Fact: The Case of TRF(H)==
The next chapter aims at giving a precise account of the way in which this process operates with respect to a single scientific fact: the [[peptide]] [[thyrotropin-releasing factor|TRF]](H).  This historical account, which Latour and Woolgar admit is, like all histories, a "necessarily literary [[fiction]]" (107), has the ostensible purpose of qualifying the initial account given by the observer.  To this end, the chapter focuses on the specific way in which TRF(H) was constructed as a fact, describing how one scientist, Guillemin, "redefine[d] the TRF subspecialty solely in terms of determining the structure of the substance" (119).  As [[molecular sequencing|sequencing]] TRF(H) required far more sophisticated equipment and techniques than merely determining its physiological effects, Guillemin raised the [[cost of entry]] to this field and cut his potential competitors by three-fourths.

The authors next claim that the fact regarding TRF(H)'s structure progressed by decreases in the number of "'logically' possible alternatives" (146).  However, Latour and Woolgar critique the explanation that "[[logic]]" or "[[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]" is a satisfactory and complete explanation for the specific way in which a scientific fact is constructed.  Instead, as their historical account of TRF(H) shows, the "list of possible alternatives by which we can evaluate the logic of a deduction is sociologically (rather than logically) determined" (136).  Specifically, the material, technical, and human resources of a laboratory affected what kinds of challenges and counter-facts could be constructed and formulated, leading Latour and Woolgar to later conclude that "the set of statements considered too costly to modify constitute what is referred to as reality" (243).

In the previous section, Latour and Woolgar used a semi-fictional observer to describe the laboratory as a literary system in which mere statements are turned into facts and vice versa.  The most sound and established facts were those statements which could be divorced from their contingent circumstances.  The authors next aim to interrogate how this process operates on a very small and specific scale by looking at how this process operated with respect to the molecule TRF(H), whose molecular structure went through various stages of facticity both in and out of the laboratory Latour studied.  In this section, Latour and Woolgar aim to "specify the precise time and place in the process of fact construction when a statement became transformed into a fact and hence freed from the circumstances of its production" (105).

Instead of trying to construct a "precise chronology" of what "really happened," in the field, they aim to demonstrate how "a hard fact can be sociologically [[deconstruction|deconstructed]]" (107) by showing how it emerged in what they call a network.  A ''network'' is "a set of positions within which an object such as TRF has meaning" (107), and they recognize that TRF only has meaning within certain networks.  For example, outside of the network of post-1960s endocrinology, TRF is "an unremarkable white powder" (108), which leads to the claim that a "well-established fact loses its meaning when divorced from its context" (110).  Latour and Woolgar stress that "to say that TRF is constructed is not to deny its solidity as a fact.  Rather, it is to emphasize how, where, and why it was created" (127).

==The Microprocessing of Facts==

This chapter turns back from grander historical accounts to the micro details of laboratory life. Through analysis of the conversations and discussions between scientists at the lab, it shows that the grander notion of science as a debate of contrasting ideas influences actual scientists only through social mechanisms. Instead of attempting to do their studies more carefully to be sure they get the right answer, scientists appear to only use as much care as they think will be necessary to defeat the counterarguments of their detractors and get the acclamation they desire for their work.

It also notes that the stories scientists tell about the history of their field often omit social and institutional factors in favor of "moment of discovery" narratives. For example, one scientist tells this story:

:Slovik proposed an assay but his assay did not work everywhere; people could not repeat it; some could, some could not. Then one day Slovik ''got the idea'' that it could be related to the selenium content in the water: they checked to see where the assay worked; and indeed, Slovik's idea was right, it worked wherever the selenium content of water was high. (169)

This story is contrasted with another story based on interviews with the participants: The University of California required that graduate students get credits in a field totally unrelated to their own. Sara, one of Slovik's students, fulfilled this requirement by taking selenium studies, since it had a vague relation to her major. Graduate students had a tradition of informal seminars where they discussed these unrelated classes. At one meeting, Sara presented a paper on the effects of Selenium on cancer and noted that someone on campus proposed that the geographical distribution of selenium content in water might correlate with the geographical distribution of cancer rates. Slovik was at the meeting and thought that this might explain the geographical difference in his assay working. He phoned a colleague to tell him the idea and ask him to test the selenium in the water.

One story says merely that Slovik "got the idea"—the other notes that institutions (the University, grad student meetings) and other people (Sara, the colleague) provided key pieces of the inspiration.

The chapter closes by arguing that scientists do not simply use their inscription devices to discover already-existing entities. Instead, they project new entities out of the analysis of their inscriptions. Statements to the effect that "it's amazing they were able to discover it" only make sense when one ignores the arduous process to construct the discovery out of the inscriptions available. Similarly, justifications that the discovery is valid because it works well outside the laboratory are fallacious. Any claims as to whether a new substance like TRF works are only valid in a laboratory context (or its extension) -- the only way one can know that the substance is actually TRF (and thus that TRF is working) is through laboratory analysis. However, the authors stress that they are not relativists—they simply believe that the social causes of statements should be investigated.

==Cycles of Credit==

Scientists frequently explain their choice of field by referring to curves of interest and development, as in "[[peptide]] chemistry [is] tapering off ... but now ... this is the future, molecular biology, and I knew that this lab would move faster to this new area" (191). Desire for credit appears to only be a secondary phenomenon; instead a kind of "credibility capital" seems to be the driving motive. In a case study, they show one scientist sequentially choosing a school, a field, a professor to study under, a specialty to get expertise in, and a research institution to work at, by maximizing and reinvesting this credibility (i.e. ability to do science), despite not having received much in the way of credit (e.g. awards, recognition).

Four examples: (a) X threatens to fire Ray if his assay fails, (b) a number of scientists flood into a field with theories after a successful experiment then leave when new evidence disproves their theories, (c) Y supports the results of "a big shot in his field" when others question them in order to receive invitations to meetings from the big shot where Y can meet new people, (d) K dismisses some of L's results on the grounds that "good people" won't believe them unless the level of noise is reduced (as opposed to K thinking them unreliable himself).

The credibility of a scientist and their results is largely seen as identical. "For a working scientist, the most vital question is not 'Did I repay my debt in the form of recognition because of the good paper he wrote?' but 'Is he reliable enough to be believed? Can I trust him/his claim? Is he going to provide me with hard facts?'" (202) CVs are the major way this credibility is proven and career trajectories are the story of its use. Technicians and minor leaguers, by contrast, do not accumulate capital but instead are paid a "salary" by major leaguers.

The preface to the second edition (1986) reads:
:''"The most substantial change to the first edition is the addition of an extended [https://books.google.com/books?id=XTcjm0flPdYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false postscript] in which we set out some of the reactions to the book's first publication in the light of developments in the social study of science since 1979. The postscript also explains the omission of the term "social" from this edition's new subtitle."''
So ''social construction'' becomes just ''construction of scientific facts''. This change indicates a shift from [[social constructivism]] to [[Actor-network theory]], which leaves more room for the non-social or 'natural' (albeit in a non-naturalistic / non-essentialist sense).

'''Love Food Hate Waste''' is a campaign, launched by the [[Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme]] in 2007, with the aim of reducing the amount of [[food waste in the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/3312730/Help-the-environment-reduce-food-waste.html | title = Help the Environment, reduce food waste | publisher = [[The Daily Telegraph]]  | accessdate = 2009-03-24 | location=London | first=Paul | last=Eccleston | date=2007-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign has been promoted and circulated by many green sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Waste Aware Love Food | url = http://www.wasteawarescotland.org.uk/html/foodWaste.asp | publisher = Waste Aware Scotland | accessdate = 2009-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign claims to have already helped almost two million households reduce their [[food waste]], amounting to savings of almost £300 million and stopping 137,000 tonnes of waste going being wasted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edie.net/news/news_story.asp?id=15861&amp;channel=0 | title = Campaign to stop food waste is working | publisher = Edie | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign has now spread to Australia, New Zealand and Canada.

== End of Use-by-date ==
In relation to the Love Food Hate Waste campaign, UK minister [[Hilary Benn]] announced plans to end the use of [[Use by date]] as he sees them as a major cause of food waste. There are plans to replace the use-by-date by new technologies such as [[Time-temperature-indicators]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6708">The '''Moredun Research Institute''' is a scientific research institution based at the '''Pentlands Science Park''', in the [[Bush Estate]] area of [[Midlothian]], Scotland. It conducts research into [[Veterinary pathology|diseases of farm livestock]] and the promotion of [[animal health]] and [[Animal welfare|welfare]].

Moredun employs over 200 [[Veterinarian|vets]], scientists and support staff, that are funded primarily by the [[Agriculture, Food and Rural Communities Directorate]] of the [[Scottish Government]]. The Institute received [[Pound sterling|£]]7.1 million from the government in 2010-11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/public-bodies/about/Bodies National Public Bodies Directory], the Scottish Government&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The '''Animal Diseases Research Association''', now the registered charity the '''Moredun Foundation''', was founded in 1920 by a group of Scottish farmers, with the aim of improving the health of livestock, especially [[Sheep farming|sheep]]. The association founded a research institute employing vets and scientists, and over the decades the scope of animal health work expanded to cover goats, cows, horses and wildlife.

The Institute was originally based at [[Moredun]], in Edinburgh.

The origins of Moredun go back to the years following World War I which saw an increased demand for home grown food and a significant rise in the market value of livestock. This emphasised the seriousness of the losses associated with disease and concerned farmers voiced their strong support for an organised body to conduct research into livestock diseases. In the 1920s Louping Ill and Braxy claimed almost a third of the lambs born in Scotland and Grass Sickness was having a devastating effect on horses, which were used for heavy labour on farms at that time. In March 1920 a group of enlightened Scottish farmers held a public meeting at the Highland and Agricultural Society’s chambers in Edinburgh and the Animal Diseases Research Association (now known as The Moredun Foundation) was formed. Within six years the founder members had raised enough funds to buy a plot of land and build the Moredun Research Institute. Within ten years of the Research Institute opening, Moredun scientists had discovered the cause and developed vaccines and treatment strategies for Braxy and lamb dysentery. Scientists then went on to solve the mystery of Louping Ill which was found to be caused by a virus transmitted by ticks and a vaccine was soon developed.

By the 1940s over half a million doses of vaccine and treatment products were produced and distributed by Moredun. Research gained momentum and further funding was secured to find out the causes of many different diseases such as: scrapie, pine, milk fever, Johne’s disease and a range of respiratory and reproductive disorders. Vaccines, diagnostics and treatment strategies followed. Today, many of the veterinary medicines and vaccines that are routinely used on farms have been researched, developed or tested at Moredun. This research is vital – 17% of the value of the UK sheep industry is lost each year due to infectious diseases. Subclinical infections of gut parasites are estimated to cost the UK sheep industry over £84 million a year in lost production. Enzootic abortion in ewes is thought to cost the UK sheep industry £15 million a year and Johne’s disease costs the UK cattle industry £13 million a year. Ninety years on, and still governed by farmers, Moredun’s mission to improve animal health and welfare remains strong and Moredun continues to apply cutting edge science and technology to help protect both livestock and people, today and tomorrow.

==Pentlands Science Park==
The Pentlands Science Park opened in 1995. It is part of the '''Moredun Group''', under the control of the Moredun Foundation. It is a [[public-private partnership]]. The Pentlands Science Park and Moredun are participants in the [[Edinburgh Science Triangle]] project.

In addition to being the home of the Moredun Research Institute, the science park has attracted 20 companies to the site. The focus of Pentlands Science Park is [[animal bioscience]] but the tenants include research companies involved in [[pharmaceuticals]], [[software]], and [[environmental science]]. The area occupied by non-Moredun organisations is approximately 55,000 [[sq ft]], and these tenants employ over 200 people.

A '''Nativity play''' or '''Christmas pageant''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] which recounts the story of the [[Nativity of Jesus]].   It is usually performed at [[Christmas]], the [[Calendar of saints|feast]] of the Nativity.

==Liturgical==
The term "Nativity Drama" is used by Wellesz&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Wellesz |first=Egon |title=The Nativity Drama of the Byzantine Church |journal=Journal of Roman Studies |volume=37 |year=1947 |pages=145–151 |doi=10.2307/298465 |publisher=Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies |jstor=298465}}
&lt;/ref&gt; in his discussion of the ''[[troparion]]'' [[hymn]]s in the Christmas [[liturgy]] of [[Byzantine Rite]] Churches, from [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] in the seventh century.  Goldstein argues&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Origin of Medieval Drama |first=Leonard |last=Goldstein |year=2004 |publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]  Press |isbn=0-8386-4004-4 |location= |pages=54–60}}
&lt;/ref&gt; that the label "drama" is misleading, that the ''troparia'' are more akin to an [[oratorio]] than a play, and that the form is not a precursor of later more decidedly dramatic forms.

Saint [[Francis of Assisi]] performed [[Midnight Mass]] in [[Greccio]] on Christmas Eve 1223 in front of a life-size [[nativity scene]] (crib or creche) built by Giovanni Velita, with live animals.  This is sometimes credited as the first nativity play. However, more formal Nativity plays have featured in [[Christian worship]] since medieval [[mystery play]]s.  The twelfth to nineteenth pageants of the 48-play [[York Mystery Cycle]] dealt with the Nativity story.  In [[Germany]], the [[Weihnachten]] services on [[Christmas Eve]] include a children's [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] called ''Weihnachtsgeschichte'', which features a ''Krippenspiel'' ("crib play").

==Popular==
In [[Latin America]] ''pastorelas'' ("shepherd's plays") are performed in many local communities.  These were imported during [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] but are no longer common in [[Spain]].  They recount the story of the [[adoration of the shepherds|shepherds travelling to worship the newborn Christ]] , augmenting the Biblical text with [[apocrypha]]l events, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] beliefs, regional features, [[anachronism]]s, [[satire]] and [[buffoonery]].  Each community's play evolves into a distinctive tradition.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Belgium]], [[puppet theatre]]s often put on variations on the Nativity play in the weeks before Christmas, with parents and their children in the audience.  The play often depicts the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] which occurred after the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref name="belg"&gt;
{{cite journal |issn=1481-4374 |journal=Comparative Literature and Culture: A WWWeb Journal |title=Symbolism, Popular Drama, and Politics and Art in Belgium, 1886-1910 |issue=5.3 Comparative Cultural Studies and Popular Culture |editor=Benton Jay Komins |url=http://clcwebjournal.lib.purdue.edu/clcweb03-3/gross03.html |first=Joan |last=Gross  |date=September 2003 |volume=5 |accessdate=2008-02-18 |publisher=[[Purdue University Press]] }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Joan Gross traces this augmentation back to cryptic protests in the late nineteenth century against the abuse of native peoples by colonists in the [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]]'s [[Congo Free State]].&lt;ref name="belg"/&gt;

In [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]] Australia, the [[Stable on the Strand]] is an annual nativity play held at the city's oceanfront park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/videos/2010/12/23/3100559.htm|title=Journey into Bethlehem|last=Fernbach|first=Nathalie|date=23 December 2010|newspaper=ABC (Australia)|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-22/stable-on-strand-first-baby-still-involved-event/7047752|title=Very first Stable on The Strand baby still supports Townsville event 17 years on|last=Fernbach|first=Nathalie|date=22 December 2015|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=10 October 2018|last2=Calderwood|first2=Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In schools==
[[File:Childrens Nativity Play 2007.jpg|thumb|A children's nativity play.]]
Many, especially [[Christian school|Christian-oriented]], [[primary school]]s and [[Sunday School]]s put on a Nativity play before the [[Christmas break]] begins. Children in costume act as the human and [[angel]] characters, and often as the animals and props. The infant Jesus is sometimes represented by a [[doll]], but sometimes played by a real baby. [[Parent]]s, grandparents, stepparents and siblings, schoolteachers and sometimes the church community in general form the audience. The tradition of Nativity plays in [[United Kingdom|British]] [[State school|state]] [[primary school#United Kingdom|primary school]]s is declining in favour of secular plays, because of the need to include pupils of other faiths. However, a survey in 2012 found that 20% of schools were planning a traditional Nativity play and a further 50% were intending to stage an updated version of the Christmas story, sometimes with new music and extra characters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1571187/School-nativity-plays-under-threat.html The Daily Telegraph - 17 December 2012 - ''School nativity plays under threat'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary==
{{Main|Nativity of Jesus in later culture}}
Modern writers to have written Nativity plays include [[Laurence Housman]] (''Bethlehem'', 1902; musical accompaniment by [[Joseph Moorat]] c.1919&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Hunt |title=Moorat |journal=[[The Musical Times]] |date=March 1975 |issue=1585 |volume=116 |pages=228 |doi=10.2307/959098 |publisher=Musical Times Publications Ltd. |jstor=959098}}
&lt;/ref&gt;); [[Lucjan Rydel]] (''Polish Bethlehem'', 1904); [[Cicely Hamilton]] (''The Child in Flanders: A Nativity Play'', 1922); and [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] (''[[He That Should Come]]'', 1938).

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s first play was ''[[Bariona ou le fils du tonerre]]'', a nativity play performed on Christmas Eve 1940 while a [[prisoner of war]] in a German [[stalag]].  Sartre saw Christ as part of the [[Jewish-Roman wars|Jewish Resistance]] to the [[Iudaea Province|Roman Empire's occupation]], mirroring the [[French Resistance]] of [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|Nazi Germany's occupation]].&lt;ref&gt;

An '''occupational exposure limit''' is an upper limit on the acceptable [[concentration]] of a [[hazardous substance]] in workplace [[air]] for a particular material or class of materials. It is typically set by competent national authorities and enforced by legislation to protect [[occupational safety and health]]. It is an important tool in [[risk assessment]] and in the management of activities involving handling of dangerous substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=European Agency for Safety and Health at Work | title=Occupational Exposure Limits | url=http://osha.europa.eu/good_practice/topics/dangerous_substances/oel | accessdate=2008-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many dangerous substances for which there are no formal occupational exposure limits. In these cases, hazard banding or [[control banding]] strategies can be used to ensure safe handling.

== Background ==
[[File:Hierarchies of Exposure Assessment and Management.JPG|thumb|Simple representation of exposure risk assessment and management hierarchy based on available information]]

Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) have been established for airborne workplace chemicals by multiple regulatory and authoritative organizations around the world for well over 60 years now.  With the changing regulatory arena, shifting centers of manufacturing growth, and the move towards a more global view on occupational hygiene issues, it is important for the [[Occupational hygiene|Occupational Hygiene]] profession to understand the current and growing issues impacting the continued viability of OEL’s in our professional practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=IOHA | title=International OEL Issues and Activities \ | url=http://www.ioha.net/internationaloelssues.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811010958/http://www.ioha.net/internationaloelssues.html | archivedate=2015-08-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although peer-reviewed health-based OELs are preferred for establishing safe levels of exposure or for implementing adequate controls to provide worker protection, the lack of publicly available OELs have led to other sources of safe levels to protect workers.  Industrial or Occupational Hygienists are often on the front line of anticipating and recognizing the hazards of chemical exposure for workers, and must assess the risk of exposure through the use of OELs so that proper control strategies can be implemented to keep workers below the OEL values.  In the absence of OELs however, there are a variety of tools that can and should be used to assess exposure potential of workers.  The "Hierarchy of OELs" provides a continuum of occupational exposure limit values that allow assessment of the risk of exposure in order to apply adequate controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=AIHA | title=Webinar:  The New Era of Global Exposure Limit Setting Processes - Harmonization on an OEL Hierarchy Approach |url=http://www.aiha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hierarchy of Occupational Exposure Limits.JPG|thumb|Hierarchy of occupational exposure limits (OELs)]]
[[File:Analysis of air sampling data using IHSTAT.JPG|thumb|Illustration of statistical output from IHSTAT using air sampling data]]
Personal air sampling is routinely conducted on workers to determine whether exposures are acceptable or unacceptable.  These samples are collected and analyzed using validated sampling and analytical methods.  These methods are available from OSHA Technical Manual and NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nmam/ NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods]&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistical tools are available to assess exposure monitoring data against OELs.  The statistical tools are typically free but do require some previous knowledge with statistical concepts.  A popular exposure data statistical tool called "IH STAT" is available from AIHA ([[American Industrial Hygiene Association]]).  IHSTAT has 14 languages including English and is available for free.&lt;ref&gt;"Link to freeware version IHSTAT via AIHA Exposure Assessment Strategies website" https://www.aiha.org/get-involved/VolunteerGroups/Pages/Exposure-Assessment-Strategies-Committee.aspx/&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods for performing occupational exposure assessments can be found in "A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H. Bullock".&lt;ref&gt;"A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H.

==Types==
* [[Permissible exposure limit]], set by the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]
* [[Recommended exposure limit]], set by the U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]
* [[Indicative limit value]], set by the European Union
* [[Threshold Limit Value|Threshold limit value]], set by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]]
* [[Occupational exposure banding]], a process that can be used when not enough data are available to determine quantiative exposure limits

== International limit values ==
The [[database]] ″GESTIS - International limit values for chemical agents″&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance: GESTIS – International limit values for chemical agents (Occupational exposure limits, OELs), http://www.dguv.de/ifa/gestis/gestis-internationale-grenzwerte-fuer-chemische-substanzen-limit-values-for-chemical-agents/index-2.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; contains a collection of occupational limit values for hazardous substances collected from over 30 countries: various [[Member state of the European Union|EU member states]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Israel]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], [[China]], [[Turkey]], and the [[United States]]. The database comprises values of more than 2,000 substances.

The present database was elaborated in co-operation with experts from various international [[occupational safety and health]] institutions. It aims to give an overview of limit values in different countries. Since the limit values vary in their handling, the level of protection, and their legal relevance, the original lists of limit values and the explanations there should be considered as primary sources. Also the [[chemical nomenclature]] is diverging, [[synonym]]s can for example be found in the [[GESTIS Substance Database]].

The database is also available as app for mobile terminals with Android or iOS operating systems.

The origins of online music education may be traced to the use of technologies to supplement face-to-face learning in traditional classroom settings, however in recent years it has expanded to include the offering of entire degree programs – even [[doctoral degree]]s – online.  

The rise of technologies leading to the development of online music education is well documented, and  such studies have become particularly popular in the United States in recent years (Schlager, 2008; Webster, 2007). Salavuo (2006) has examined the recent popularization of informal engagement with music technology in online social networks, which may embody a form of informal community music education. The potential of online music education to create positive change in terms of professional development has been noted by various scholars (Hebert, 2008; Sherbon &amp; Kish, 2005); However, concerns have also been raised regarding the absence of a sufficient research base concerning the effectiveness of online music education (Hebert, 2007; Webster, 2007). It is likely that more studies will be seen in this high-growth area in the coming years.

== Institutions offering online music education ==
The following is a partial list of North American institutions that offer online degree programs in [[music education]]:

'''Palaeozoology''', also spelled as '''Paleozoology''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: [[wikt:παλαιός|παλαιόν]], ''palaeon'' "old" and [[wikt:ζῷον|ζῷον]], ''zoon'' "animal"), is the branch of [[paleontology]], [[paleobiology]], or [[zoology]] dealing with the recovery and identification of [[multicellular]] [[animal]] remains from [[geological]] (or even [[archeological]]) contexts, and the use of these [[fossil]]s in the reconstruction of [[prehistoric]] [[natural environment|environment]]s and [[paleoecology|ancient ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name=Quantitative /&gt;

Definitive, macroscopic remains of these [[metazoa]]ns are found in the [[fossil record]] from the [[Ediacaran]] period of the [[Neoproterozoic]] era onwards, although they do not become common until the Late [[Devonian]] period in the latter half of the [[Paleozoic]] era. 

Perhaps the best known [[macrofossil]]s group is the [[dinosaur]]s. Other popularly known animal-derived macrofossils include [[trilobite]]s, [[crustacean]]s, [[echinoderms]], [[brachiopod]]s, [[mollusk]]s, [[bony fish]]es, [[shark]]s, [[Vertebrate]] [[Tooth|teeth]], and [[Animal shell|shell]]s of numerous [[invertebrate]] groups. This is because hard organic parts, such as bones, teeth, and shells resist decay, and are the most commonly preserved and found animal fossils.  Exclusively [[Soft-bodied organisms|soft-bodied animals]]—such as [[jellyfish]], [[flatworm]]s, [[nematode]]s, and [[insect]]s—are consequently rarely [[fossilization|fossilized]], as these groups do not produce hard organic parts.

== Vertebrate Paleozoology ==
Vertebrate paleozoology refers to the use of morphological, temporal, and stratigraphic data to map vertebrate history in evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=Everett C.|title=Vertebrate Paleozoology|year=1971|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertebrates are classified as a subphylum of Chordata, a phylum used to classify species adhering to a rod-shaped, flexible body type called a notochord.&lt;ref name=Olson /&gt; They differ from other phyla in that other phyla may have cartilage or cartilage-like tissues forming a sort of skeleton, but only vertebrates possess what we define as bone.&lt;ref name=Olson /&gt;

Classes of vertebrates listed in chronological order from oldest to most recent include heterostracans, osteostracans, coelolepid agnathans, acanthodians, osteichthyan fishes, chondrichthyan fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. All vertebrates are studied under standard evolutionary generalizations of behavior and life process, although there is controversy over whether population can be accurately estimated from limited fossil resources.&lt;ref name=Olson /&gt;

Evolutionary origins of vertebrates as well as the phylum Chordata have not been scientifically determined. Many believe vertebrates diverged from a common ancestor of chordates and echinoderms. This belief is well supported by the prehistoric marine creature Amphioxus. Amphioxus does not possess bone, making it an invertebrate, but it has common features with vertebrates including a segmented body and a notochord. This could imply that Amphioxus is a transitional form between an early chordate, echinoderm or common ancestor, and vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Olson /&gt;

== Quantitative Paleozoology ==
Quantitative paleozoology is a process of taking a census of fossil types rather than inventory. They differ in that inventory refers to a detailed log of individual fossils, whereas census attempts to group individual fossils to tally the total number of a species. This information can be used to determine which species were most dominant and which had the largest population at a time period or in a geological region.&lt;ref name=Quantitative&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyman|first=R. Lee|title=Quantitative Paleozoology|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, paleontologists [[Chester Stock]] and [[Hildegarde Howard]] devised special units for quantitative paleozoology and quantitative paleontology. The first unit used, Number of Identified Species (NISP), specified exact quantity of fossils from a specific species recorded. Stock and Howard determined this unit to be problematic for quantitative purposes as an excess of a small fossil—such as teeth—could exaggerate quantity of the species. There was also an amount of confusion as to whether bone fragments should be assembled and counted as one bone or tallied individually.&lt;ref name=Quantitative /&gt; Stock and Howard then devised the Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI), which estimated the minimum number of animals needed to produce the fossils recorded.&lt;ref name=Quantitative /&gt; For example, if five scapulae from a species were found, it might be difficult to determine whether some of them were paired right and left on one individual or whether each came from a different individual, which could alter census, but it could be said that there must be at least three individuals to produce five scapulae. Three would thus be the MNI.&lt;ref name=Quantitative /&gt; In rare cases where enough of a collection of fossils can be assembled into individuals as to provide an accurate number of individuals, the unit used is Actual Number of Individuals, or ANI.&lt;ref name=Quantitative /&gt;

Another unit commonly used in quantitative paleozoology is biomass. Biomass is defined as the amount of tissue in an area or from a species.&lt;ref name=Quantitative /&gt; It is calculated by estimating an average weight based on similar modern species and multiplying it by the MNI. This yields an estimate of how much the entire population of a species may have weighed.&lt;ref name=Quantitative /&gt; Problems with this measurement include the difference in weight between youngsters and adults, seasonal weight changes due to diet and hibernation, and the difficulty of accurately estimating the weight of a creature with only a skeletal reference.&lt;ref name=Quantitative /&gt; It is also difficult to determine exact age of fossilized matter within a year or a decade, so a biomass might be grossly exaggerated or under exaggerated if the estimated time frame in which the fossils were alive is incorrect.&lt;ref name=Quantitative /&gt;

A similar measurement to biomass is meat weight.&lt;ref name=Quantitative /&gt; To determine meat weight, MNI is multiplied by the amount of meat an individual is thought to have provided, then multiplied by the percentage of that meat thought to be edible. This gives an estimate of “pounds of usable meat” per individual which might have been harvested by prehistoric hunters.&lt;ref name=Quantitative /&gt; For example, a male Wapiti has an average weight of 400&amp;nbsp;kg, and in a particular study, the MNI of Wapiti was found to be 10. This would create a biomass of 4,000&amp;nbsp;kg. If the amount of edible meat is estimated at 50 percent, this would result in a meat weight of 2,000&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=Quantitative /&gt; The biggest problem with this method is the debate over “percent of usable meat.” Different views on which parts of a species are edible and which are not as well as whether or not primitive butchers would have been able to access and prepare different parts have led to controversy.&lt;ref name=Quantitative /&gt;

== Conservation Biology ==
Paleozoological data is used in research concerning [[conservation biology]]. Conservation biology refers to biological study used for conservation, control, and preservation of various species and [[ecosystems]]. In this context, the paleozoological data used is obtained from recently deceased decomposing matter rather than prehistoric matter.&lt;ref name="lyman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyman|first=R. Lee|title=Paleozoology in the Service of Conservation Biology|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|date=February 2006|volume=15|issue=1|pages=11–19|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/evan.20083/abstract|accessdate=28 March 2012|doi=10.1002/evan.20083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee Lyman: Zooarchaeology and Vertebrate Taphonomy|url=http://faculty.missouri.edu/~lymanr/|publisher=Curators of the University of Missouri|accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that paleozoological research can provide data such as extinction rates and causes and “benchmark” peaks and drops in population which can be used to predict future patterns and to design maximally effective methods of controlling these patterns.&lt;ref name=lyman /&gt; In addition, paleozoological data can be used to compare current to former population and distribution of a species.

'''Penile plethysmography''' ('''PPG''') or '''phallometry''' is measurement of [[blood]]flow to the [[human penis|penis]], typically used as a proxy for measurement of [[sexual arousal]]. The most commonly reported methods of conducting penile plethysmography involve the measurement of the circumference of the penis with a mercury-in-rubber or electromechanical [[strain gauge]], or the volume of the penis with an airtight cylinder and inflatable cuff at the base of the penis. [[Corpus cavernosum penis|Corpora cavernosa]] nerve penile plethysmographs measure changes in response to inter-operative electric stimulation during surgery. The volumetric procedure was invented by [[Kurt Freund]] and is considered to be particularly sensitive at low arousal levels. The easier to use circumferential measures are more widely used, however, and more common in studies using [[erotic film]] stimuli. A corresponding device in women is the [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]].&lt;ref&gt;Prause, Nicole, and Erick Janssen. "Blood flow: Vaginal photoplethysmography." Women’s sexual function and dysfunction: Study, diagnosis, and treatment (2006): 359-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

For sexual offenders it is typically used to determine the level of sexual arousal as the subject is exposed to sexually suggestive content, such as pictures, movies or audio, although some have argued that phallometry is not always appropriate for the evaluation of sexual preferences or treatment effects.&lt;ref name="simon"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Simon W.

For [[prostatectomy]] [[nerve-sparing surgery]], the surgeon applies a mild electrical stimulation near the [[cavernous nerves of penis]] to verify their locations and avoid operative trauma. Damage to these difficult-to-see nerves can cause [[erectile dysfunction]] outcomes. At the surgery's conclusion, the electrical stimulation penile plethysmograph result is a [[prognosis]] which helps to manage the erectile function outcomes earlier than the many months required for recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Klotz L, Heaton J, Jewett M, etal |title=A randomized phase 3 study of intraoperative cavernosa nerve stimulation with penile tumescence monitoring to improve nerve sparing during radical prostatectomy |journal=J.

==Types==
There are two types of penile plethysmograph:

*Volumetric air chamber
:When this is placed over the subject's penis, as [[tumescence]] increases, the air displaced is measured.
*Circumferential transducer
:This uses a mercury-in-rubber or indium/gallium-in-rubber ring or electromechanical [[strain gauge]] and is placed around the shaft of the subject's penis to measure changes in circumference.

The circumferential type is more common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Howes R. J. | year = 1995 | title = A survey of plethysmographic assessment in North America | url = | journal = Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 9–24 | doi=10.1007/bf02254871}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the volumetric method is believed to be more accurate at low arousal levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuban M, Barbaree HE, Blanchard R |title=A comparison of volume and circumference phallometry: response magnitude and method agreement |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=345–59 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10553495 |doi= 10.1023/A:1018700813140|url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0004-0002&amp;volume=28&amp;page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant suppliers of PPG machines include Behavioral Technology Inc. and Medical Monitoring Systems. The device is known to be used in [[Brazil]], [[UK|Britain]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hong Kong]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Slovak Republic]], [[Spain]], and the [[United States]].

The surgical machine is supplied as CaverMap by Blue Torch Medical Technology, Inc.

A roughly equivalent procedure for women, [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]]y, measures blood through the walls of the [[vagina]], which researchers claim increases during sexual arousal.

==History==
The original volumetric was developed during the 1950s by [[Kurt Freund]] in then-[[Czechoslovakia]]. Freund later wrote, "In the early fifties homosexual interaction was still an indictable offense in Czechoslovakia. I was of course opposed to this measure, but I still thought, as did my colleagues at the psychiatric university hospital in Prague where I was working, that homosexuality was an experientially acquired neurosis". He then developed phallometry to replace [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] methods of assessment because "[P]sychoanalysis had turned out to be a failure, virtually unusable as an instrument for individual diagnosis or research....When phallometry began to look promising as a test of erotic sex and age preferences, we started using it mainly as a test of [[pedophilia]], that is determining who has an erotic preference for children over adults".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Freund K | year = 1991 | title = Reflections on the development of the phallometric method of assessing sexual preference | url = | journal = Annals of Sex Research | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 221–228 | doi = 10.1007/BF00850054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In post–World War II Czechoslovakia, Freund was assigned by the communist government the task of identifying among military conscripts men who were falsely declaring themselves to be gay to avoid the draft.&lt;ref name = wilson2006&gt;Wilson, R. J., &amp; Mathon, H. F. (2006, fall). Remembering Kurt Freund (1914-1996). ''ATSA Forum.''

Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; When he escaped Europe for Canada, Freund was able to pursue his research using phallometry for the assessment of sexual offenders.&lt;ref name = wilson2006/&gt; At that time, attempts to develop methods of changing homosexual men into heterosexual men were being made by many sexologists, including [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bancroft J |title=Aversion therapy of homosexuality.

(See also [[LGBT rights in the Czech Republic]].)

==Reliability and validity==
In 1994, the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (Fourth Edition) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] stated that penile plethysmography has been used in research settings to assess various paraphilias by measuring an individual's sexual arousal in response to visual and auditory stimuli. The reliability and validity of this procedure in clinical assessment have not been well established, and clinical experience suggests that subjects can simulate response by manipulating mental images."&lt;ref name="dsmiv"&gt;DSM-IV, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, a recent meta-analysis provides support for the validity of phallometric testing as a measure of sexual interests in children across 37 samples and 6,785 individuals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McPhail|first=Ian V.|last2=Hermann|first2=Chantal A.|last3=Fernane|first3=Stephanie|last4=Fernandez|first4=Yolanda M.|last5=Nunes|first5=Kevin L.|last6=Cantor|first6=James M.|title=Validity in Phallometric Testing for Sexual Interests in Children: A Meta-Analytic Review|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1073191117706139|journal=Assessment|language=en|doi=10.1177/1073191117706139|year=2017|page=107319111770613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Hanson and Bussière published a comprehensive meta-analysis of 61 scientific reports on the prediction of sexual offenses spanning more than 40,000 individual cases. They ascertained that of all the methods attempted and reported, penile phethysmographic responses to imagery depicting [[children]] was the single most accurate predictor of sexual re-offense across 7 studies reporting data from phallometric testing.&lt;ref name = Hanson1998/&gt; Another meta-analysis in 2005 of 13 studies and 2,180 individual cases repeated the finding that phallometric responses to children was a strong predictor of sexual re-offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hanson R. K. |author2=Morton-Bourgon K. E. | year = 2005 | title = The characteristics of persistent sexual offenders: A meta-analysis of recidivism studies | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 1154–1163 | doi=10.1037/0022-006x.73.6.1154 | pmid=16392988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent meta-analysis that included 16 samples and 2,709 sexual offenders replicated and extended the previous findings that phallometric responding to children is a predictor of sexual re-offence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This meta-analysis extended previous meta-analytic research by showing phallometric responding to both male and female pedophilic and [[Hebephilia|hebephilic]] stimuli predict sexual re-offence.   Further, this meta-analysis showed that phallometric testing predicts sexual re-offence in distinct subgroups of sexual offenders against children.

===Critique of methodological problems===
There are criticisms of the methodology used to determine the reliability and specificity of penile plethysmography. One such criticism is that while penile plethysmography is said to be important for being more objective than a test subject’s subjective reports on sexual arousal, the argument for penile plethysmography being a more reliable gauge of sexual arousal than vaginal plethysmography is still that there is a higher correspondence on average between what the test subjects report and what the instruments observe in male subjects than in female subjects. There is a criticism of this discrepancy for lacking consistency in the standards of whether or not subjective reports are useful. There is also criticism regarding the possibility of sampling bias being greater in male subjects of penile plethysmography than in female subjects of vaginal plethysmography, males being generally more aware of their physical sexual responses than females in most cultures may cause the male volunteers to be almost exclusively individuals who have category specific erections due to those with nonspecific erections fearing erection in taboo contexts and therefore not signing up for the studies. This effect may explain apparent male specificity as a result of methodological bias. The difference between tests of volunteers and tests of convicted or suspected sex offenders in penile plethysmography results may be caused by the sex offender group often effectively lacking the choice not to volunteer, without difference in erection patterns from the average population. One criticism of reoffending studies is that cultural attitudes that assume that men are sexually attracted to what they phallometrically respond to may cause men with no actual sexual interest in children to identify as pedophiles due to knowing that they phallometrically respond to them, making them more likely to be convicted again.&lt;ref&gt;Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology, Scott O. Lilienfeld, Steven Jay Lynn, Jeffrey M. Lohr 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;At the Fringes of Science, 1998, Michael W. Friedlander&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pedophilia, hebephilia, pedohebephilia, and ephebophilia===
Studies examining the efficiency of using penile plethysmograph to distinguish [[Pedophilia|pedophilic]] men from non-pedophilic men, including [[Hebephilia|hebephiles]], show that a majority can be correctly assigned to the proper category.&lt;ref name="pmid11281033"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blanchard R, Klassen P, Dickey R, Kuban ME, Blak T |title=Sensitivity and specificity of the phallometric test for pedophilia in nonadmitting sex offenders |journal=Psychol Assess |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=118–26 |date=March 2001 |pmid=11281033 |doi= 10.1037/1040-3590.13.1.118|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/pas/13/1/118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="57-1-100"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Freund K, Blanchard R |title=Phallometric diagnosis of pedophilia |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=100–5 |date=February 1989 |pmid=2925958 |doi= 10.1037/0022-006X.57.1.100|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/ccp/57/1/100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, W. &amp; Barbaree, H.

Brandon, VT: Safer Society Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sensitivity and specificity|Sensitivity]] of a phallometric test is defined as the accuracy of the test to identify pedophilic (or hebephilic) individuals as having these sexual interests. [[Sensitivity and specificity|Specificity]] of these tests is defined as the accuracy of the test to identify non-pedophilic (or non-hebephilic) individuals as such.  Meta-analytic research has shown that sexual offenders against children show greater responding on phallomtric tests for pedophilia and hebephilia than controls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Volumetric penile plethysmography ====
In one study, 21% of the subjects were excluded for various reasons, including "the subject's erotic age-preference was uncertain and his phallometrically diagnosed sex-preference was the same as his verbal claim" and attempts to influence the outcome of the test.&lt;ref name="57-1-100"/&gt; This study found the sensitivity for identifying pedohebephilia in sexual offenders against children admitting to this interest to be 100%.  In addition, the sensitivity for this phallometric test in partially admitting sexual offenders against children was found to be 77% and for denying sexual offenders against children to be 58%.  The specificity of this volumetric phallometric test for pedohebephilia was estimated to be 95%.

Further studies by Freund have estimated the sensitivity of a volumetric test for pedohebephilia to be 35% for sexual offenders against children with a single female victim, 70% for those with two or more female victims, 77% for those offenders with one male victim, and 84% for those with two or more male victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freund|first1=K.|last2=Watson|first2=R.

In a similar study, the sensitivity of a volumetric test for pedophilia to be 62% for sexual offenders against children with a single female victim, 90% for those with two or more female victims, 76% for those offenders with one male victim, and 95% for those with two or more male victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freund|first1=K.|last2=Watson|first2=R.

In a separate study, sensitivity of the method to distinguish between pedohebephilic men from non-pedohebephilic men was estimated between 29% and 61% depending on subgroup.&lt;ref name="pmid11281033"/&gt;  Specifically, sensitivity was estimated to be 61% for sexual offenders against children with 3 or more victims and 34% in incest offenders.  The specificity of the test using a sample of sexual offenders against adults was 96% and the [[area under the curve]] for the test was estimated to be .86.  Further research by this group found the specificity of this test to be 83% in a sample of non-offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanchard|first1=R.|last2=Kuban|first2=M.

==== Circumferential penile plethysmography ====
Other studies have examined the sensitivity and specificity of circumferential phallometry to identify different sexual interests in children.

In addition, Abel and colleagues found [[Ephebophilia|ephebophilic]] stimuli to have a sensitivity of 50%.&lt;ref name="abel et al" /&gt;

Another study examined the possibility that juvenile sex offenders might be able to suppress arousal deemed deviant.  Of the juveniles who exhibited sexual arousal, categorization was made into two age appropriate categories—Adult and Peer responders—and three age inappropriate categories—Child, Child/Adult, and Nondiscriminating responders—based on whether they had the greatest sexual arousal in response to adult female, peer female, or younger child female stimuli.  Sexual arousal in response to older adult women or peers was deemed age appropriate;  sexual arousal in response to significantly younger females was deemed inappropriate.  Many of the juveniles who denied responsibility for their offenses showed no sexual arousal at all—however about one-third still showed age inappropriate arousal despite denying responsibility for their offenses.&lt;ref name="23-1-87"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Becker J.V. |author2=Kaplan M |author3=Tenke C |title=The Relationship of Abuse History, Denial and Erectile Response Profiles of Adolescent Sexual Perpetrators |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=87–97 |date=Winter 1992 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005789405803107 |doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(05)80310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-dressing===
Phallometry might distinguish men with erotic interests in [[cross-dressing]] from non-cross-dressers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Buhrich N. |author2=McConaghy N. | year = 1977 | title = The discrete syndromes of transvestism and transsexualism | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 483–495 | doi=10.1007/bf01541153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Freund K. |author2=Seto M.

===Biastophilia===
There is some evidence that phallometry can distinguish groups of men with [[biastophilia]] (a [[paraphilia]] involving [[rape]]) from groups of men without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seto M. C. |author2=Kuban M. | year = 1996 | title = Criterion-related validity of a phallometric test for paraphilic rape and sadism | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 175–183 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(95)00056-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal admissibility==
In general, phallometric test results are employed as part of the sentencing and rehabilitation phase of forensic systems, but ''not'' for determining whether a specific defendant is guilty of any specific offense against any specific person.

=== United States ===

====Use as trial evidence====
In the [[United States]], a scientific technique could not be used as evidence in court unless the technique was "generally accepted" as reliable in the relevant scientific community. This was known as the [[Frye standard]], adopted in 1923. In 1993, the doctrine was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in favor of a more comprehensive "reliable foundation" test in ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]]''. In the [[Daubert standard]], the "generally accepted" test was no longer determinative. Several other factors could now be considered, including whether the technique had been published and peer reviewed. Myers notes, "Courts that have considered penile plethysmography generally rule that the technique is not sufficiently reliable for use in court."&lt;ref name="myers"&gt;Myers JEB (2005). ''Myers on Evidence in Child, Domestic, and Elder Abuse Cases.'' Aspen Publishers Online {{ISBN|0-7355-5668-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''United States v. Powers'' the court excluded the penile plethysmograph test because it failed to qualify under Daubert's scientific validity prong for two reasons: the scientific literature does not regard the test as a valid diagnostic tool, and "a vast majority of incest offenders who do not admit their guilt, such as Powers, show a normal reaction to the test. The Government argues that such [[false negative]]s render the test unreliable."&lt;ref name="powers"&gt;''United States v. Powers'', 59 F.3d 1460 (4th Cir. 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Barker and Howell, penile plethysmography (PPG) does not meet the legal threshold for the guilt phase for the following reasons:&lt;ref name="barker"&gt;Barker and Howell, The Plethysmograph: A Review of Recent Literature, 20 ''Bull. Am. Acad. of Psychiatry and Law'' 13 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

*No standardization
*Test results are not sufficiently accurate
*Results are subject to faking and voluntary control by test subjects
*High incidence of false negatives and false positives
*Results are open to interpretation

They concluded, "Until a way can be devised to detect and/or control false negatives and false positives, the validity of the test data will be questionable."&lt;ref name="barker"/&gt; Responding to Barker and Howell, Simon and Schouten noted, "Our own analysis suggests that the standardization and faking issues, as well as other problems not addressed in the Barker and Howell paper, warrant much more guarded conclusions about the use of the plethysmograph in legal and clinical settings."&lt;ref name="simon"/&gt; Prentky noted "the increased likelihood in forensic settings that dissimulation may compromise the validity of the assessment."&lt;ref name="prentky"&gt;Prentky RA, Knight RA, Lee AFS (1997) Risk factors associated with recidivism among extrafamilial child molesters. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology.''&lt;/ref&gt; Hall and Crowther noted penile plethysmography "may be even more problematic than other [methods] in assessing susceptibility of the test to faking."&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;Hall GCN, Crowther JH (1991). Psychologists' involvement in cases of child maltreatment: additional limits of assessment methods. ''[[American Psychologist]]'' Jan Vol 46(1) 79-80&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''State of North Carolina v. Spencer'',&lt;ref name="spencer"&gt;North Carolina v. Spencer, 459 S.E.2d 812, 815 (N.C. Ct. App. 1995),&lt;/ref&gt; the court reviewed the literature and case law and concluded that penile plethysmography was scientifically unreliable: "Despite the sophistication of the current equipment technology, a question remains whether the information emitted is a valid and reliable means of assessing sexual preference."

More recently, a substantial amount of research data has been gathered and reviewed, and significant steps have been taken toward standardization.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} According to Launay (1999), "[T]he validity of the technique for research and clinical assessment is now established;"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/cbm.317 | last1 = Launay | first1 = G. | year = 1999 | title = The phallometric assessment of sex offenders: an update | url = | journal = Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 254–274 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is only the use in guilt-determination proceedings that is inappropriate.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Fedoroff and Moran called it an "experimental procedure" and noted, "Virtually every expert who has written about phallometry has cautioned that it is insufficiently sensitive or specific to be used to determine the guilt or innocence of a person accused of a sex crime."&lt;ref name="fedoroff"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fedoroff | first1 = JP | last2 = Moran | first2 = B | year = 1997 | title = Myths and Misconceptions about Sex Offenders | url = | journal = The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-conviction use====
Phallometry is widely considered appropriate for treatment and supervision of convicted [[Sex and the law|sex offenders]]: "Courts have permitted plethysmographic testing for monitoring compliance by convicted sex offenders with the conditions of their community placement as part of crime-related treatment for sexual deviancy."&lt;ref&gt;Sachsenmaier, S.

Peters (Ed.), ''Assessment and management of sex offenders: What prosecutors need to know.''

(2004). ''ATSA Practice Standards and Guidelines for the evaluation, treatment and management of adult male sexual abusers.''

Weber'', 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 15111 (9th Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The device is routinely used at civil commitment facilities, but "some clinicians and offenders say it is easy, particularly in a laboratory, to stifle arousal and thus cheat on a plethysmograph test."&lt;ref name="goodnough"&gt;Goodnough A, Davey M (March 6, 2007). [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/us/06civil.html For Sex Offenders, a Dispute Over Therapy's Benefits.] ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; This has been reported to occur in 16% of cases.&lt;ref name="pmid11281033"/&gt;

During the [[Catholic sex abuse cases]], the reliability of the test was questioned by some officials in the [[Sexual abuse scandal in Philadelphia archdiocese|Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]]. Later, these officials chose to seek therapy at an institution where the plethysmograph was not used.&lt;ref&gt;''Court of Common Pleas, First Judicial District of PA'', County Investigating Grand Jury, 9-17-2003
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===

Courts in [[Canada]] came to a similar conclusion as those in the United States. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] adopted the [[Daubert standard|Daubert doctrine]] in ''R. v . J.-L.J.'' [2000] 2 S.C.R. 600, which upheld a lower court's decision to exclude testimony by a psychiatrist who had administered several tests on the accused, including a penile plethysmograph:

{{quote|A level of reliability that is quite useful in therapy because it yields some information about a course of treatment is not necessarily sufficiently reliable to be used in a court of law to identify or exclude the accused as a potential perpetrator of an offence. In fact, penile plethysmography has received a mixed reception in Quebec courts: ''Protection de la jeunesse'' – 539, [1992] R.J.Q. 1144; ''R. c. Blondin'', [1996] Q.J. No. 3605 (QL) (S.C.); L.

Efforts to use penile plethysmography in the United States as proof of disposition have largely been rejected: ''People v. John W.'', 185 Cal.App.3d 801 (1986); ''Gentry v.

As of 2010, all youth in sex offender treatment programs administered by the Youth Forensic Psychiatric Service of [[British Columbia]] were offered a voluntary penile plethysmograph test to predict whether they can properly control their deviant arousal, or whether they will require medication or other forms of treatment. According to sceptics, however, the test does not reliably predict recurrent violations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/07/29/adrian-macnair-b-c-government-rethinks-penis-arousal-tests/ Adrian MacNair: B.C. government rethinks penis-arousal tests (National Post, July 29, 2010)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711073409/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/07/29/adrian-macnair-b-c-government-rethinks-penis-arousal-tests/ |date=July 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics and legality of use===
[[Robert Todd Carroll]] writes, "More objectionable than the questionable scientific validity of the device, however, are the moral and legal questions its use raises."&lt;ref name="todd2003"&gt;Carroll, Robert Todd (2003). Penile plethysmograph (PPG). ''The skeptic's dictionary: a collection of strange beliefs, amusing deceptions, and dangerous delusions,'' pp. 278-281. John Wiley and Sons, {{ISBN|978-0-471-27242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll and others cite the legality of the depictions of minors, as well as the constitutionality of requiring PPG for admission to jobs or the military, or in custody cases. In ''Harrington v. Almy'' the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] found that a PPG ordered to be administered by [[William O'Donohue]] as a precondition of employment was a violation of plaintiff's rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="harrison"&gt;''Harrington v.

The EU's leading human rights agency, the Fundamental Rights Agency, has criticised the use of phallometric tests by the Czech Republic to determine whether asylum seekers presenting themselves as homosexual were in fact gay. According to the Agency, the Czech Republic was in 2010 the only EU country to employ a sexual arousal test, which the Agency said could violate the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11954499 Czech gay asylum 'phallometric test' criticised by EU (BBC, December 8, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the [[EU commission]] issued a statement calling the Czech practice illegal, saying "The practice of phallometric tests constitutes a strong interference with the person's private life and human dignity. This kind of degrading treatment should not be accepted in the European Union, nor elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/22/32349 Czech sexuality tests not legal, EU commission says (EUobserver, 17.05.2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech Interior Ministry replied that the testing was conducted only after written consent has been obtained, and when it was not possible to use a different method of verification. According to the Ministry, all those who had passed the test had been granted asylum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2010/12/08/czech_republic_defends_test_of_gay_asylum_seekers_despite_eu_criticism.html Czech Republic defends test of gay asylum seekers despite EU criticism (Thestar.com, Dec 08 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The only surviving original piece of the '''Polish Crown Jewels''' from the time of the  [[Piast dynasty]] is the ceremonial [[sword]] – [[Szczerbiec]]. It is currently on display along with other preserved royal items at the [[Wawel Castle|Wawel Royal Castle Museum]] in [[Kraków]].

Several royal crowns were made, including several during the 16th Century, a "[[Hungarian Crown]]", a "Swedish Crown" used by the Vasa kings, and others that were subsequently lost or destroyed. The crown regalia used by the [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]] kings, and some remainders of older [[Polish monarchs]] which were appropriated by king [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus II]], also the [[Elector of Saxony]]; like a cup of Queen [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] so-called ''roztruchan'', and the magnificent scale armour, so-called ''karacena'', of King [[John III Sobieski]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilanow-palac.pl/jan_iii_sobieski_s_karacena.html Jan III Sobieski's Karacena] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230232/http://www.wilanow-palac.pl/jan_iii_sobieski_s_karacena.html |date=March 3, 2016 }} at the Wilanów Palace Museum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author = Hanna Widacka |url = http://www.wilanow-palac.art.pl/index.php?enc=344 |format= |title = Karacena Jana III Sobieskiego |work = www.wilanow-palac.art.pl |publisher =  |pages =  |page =  |date = |accessdate = 2009-02-16|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.krakow2000.pl/biuletyn/biuletyn_33/biuletyn_4.html |title=Kultura artystyczna dworu królewskiego i katedry |work=www.krakow2000.pl |publisher= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2009-02-16 |language=pl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031124100235/http://www.krakow2000.pl/biuletyn/biuletyn_33/biuletyn_4.html |archivedate=November 24, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Lileyko Jerzy | coauthors = | title = Vademecum Zamku Warszawskiego (Vademecum of the Royal Castle in Warsaw)| year = 1980 | editor =  | page =129| pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher = | location = | isbn = 83-223-1818-9 | url = | format = | accessdate = |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; are today on display in the [[Grünes Gewölbe]] and the [[Dresden Armory|Rüstkammer]] in [[Dresden]], Germany.

==History==
[[File:Maurycy.jpg|thumb|upright|right|90px|Polish replica of the [[Holy Lance]], [[Wawel Cathedral]] Treasury]]
[[File:Korona Boleslawa Chrobrego.jpg|thumb|left|[[Crown of Bolesław I the Brave]]]]
In AD 1000, during his pilgrimage to the tomb of [[Adalbert of Prague|Saint Adalbert]] in [[Gniezno]], the capital of Poland until about 1040, Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] officially recognized Duke [[Bolesław I Chrobry|Bolesław I the Brave]] as King of Poland (see [[Congress of Gniezno]]), crowning him and presenting him with a replica of the [[Holy Lance]], also known as [[Saint Maurice]]'s Spear.&lt;ref name="lileyko1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lileyko|1987|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[relic]], together with the ''vexillum'' attached to it, was probably the first insignia of the nascent [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]], a symbol of King Bolesław's rule, and of his allegiance to the Emperor.&lt;ref name="lileyko1" /&gt; It remains unknown what images, if any, were painted or embroidered on the ''vexillum''.&lt;ref name="lileyko1" /&gt;

Starting from 1320 the regalia of the Polish kings were kept in the treasury of the [[Wawel Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="rozek1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rożek|1987|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1370 [[Louis I of Hungary]] decided to transfer the Polish regalia to [[Hungary]] and they were returned in 1412 to Andrzej of [[Rożnów, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Rożnów]] embassy by Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]].&lt;ref name="rozek1" /&gt; During the reign of the [[Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellons]] the regalia were moved from the cathedral to the [[Wawel Castle]] and placed in the specially prepared Crown Treasury. In the 17th century they were repeatedly brought to [[Warsaw]] for the coronations of the [[List of Polish consorts|Polish Queens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rożek|1987|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]] in 1655, the royal insignia were evacuated from the castle by [[Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski]], Grand Marshal of the Crown and hidden in the old castle in [[Stará Ľubovňa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rożek|1987|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were stored there until 1661. In 1703 during the [[Great Northern War]] they were hidden again, first in [[Silesia]], then in [[Moravia]]. During the double election of 1733, the regalia were stolen by the follower of [[Stanisław Leszczyński|Stanisław I Leszczyński]], [[Franciszek Maksymilian Ossoliński]], Grand Treasurer of the Crown, who concealed them in the [[Holy Cross Church, Warsaw|Holy Cross Church]] in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="rozek3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rożek|1987|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1734, however, they were recovered from the hideout and deposited in the [[Jasna Góra Monastery]], where they remained till 1736.&lt;ref name="rozek1" /&gt; In 1764, with the consent of the [[Sejm]], the royal insignia were transported to Warsaw for the coronation of King [[Stanisław II August]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rożek|1987|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later returned to the Wawel Castle, where they were kept till the [[Third Partition of Poland]] in 1795.

On 15 June 1794 the [[Prussian Army]] entered Kraków and captured Wawel Castle, subsequently turning it into a fortress. Shortly thereafter, the city commandant, general Leopold von Reuts began a correspondence with [[Berlin]] on the fate of furnishings of the Polish kings' residence.&lt;ref name="kradziez"&gt;{{cite web|author = |url = http://www.replikiregaliowpl.com/kradziez.html|title = Kradzież i zniszczenie|work = www.replikiregaliowpl.com|publisher = |pages = |page = |date = |accessdate = 2010-10-30|language = pl|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715174236/http://www.replikiregaliowpl.com/kradziez.html|archive-date = 2011-07-15|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the greatest secrecy, by order of king [[Frederick William II of Prussia]], he was commanded to transfer the content of the Crown Treasury to the Secret Councillor Anton Ludwig von Hoym, who was to secure its transport via [[Silesia]] to Berlin.&lt;ref name="kradziez" /&gt; The locksmith brought by the Prussians broke the locks of the treasury and then opened all the boxes.&lt;ref name="kradziez" /&gt; The valuables were transported in 1794 and found their place in the collection of the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollerns]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name="kradziez" /&gt;

In 1800 the valuables were stored in the [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Berlin City Palace]], where they were admired by [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex]], as he informed [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]].&lt;ref name="kuhnke"&gt;{{cite web  |author = Monika Kuhnke |url = http://www.zabytki.pl/sources/straty/wstep.html |title = Rabunek od czasów zaborów do II wojny światowej |work = www.zabytki.pl |publisher = |pages =  |page = |date = |accessdate = 2010-10-30|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1809 the Polish regalia were valued at 525,259 [[thaler]]s and shortly after, on 17 March 1809, in accordance with the decision of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]], all of them were melted down.&lt;ref name="kuhnke" /&gt; The obtained gold was reused to make coins, while precious stones and pearls were handed to the Directorate of Maritime Trade in Berlin.&lt;ref name="kuhnke" /&gt;

According to an inventory of the State Treasury at the [[Wawel]] performed in 1633 by the [[Jerzy Ossoliński]], [[Kanclerz|Great Crown Chancellor]] the ''Crown Regalia'' of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (kept in five chests) consisted of:
* the [[Crown of Bolesław I the Brave]], according to a legend handed over to the first Polish monarch by Emperor Otto III, made for [[Władysław I the Elbow-high]]
* the so-called "[[Queens Crown]]" made for [[Hedwig of Kalisz|Jadwiga of Kalisz]]
* the so-called "[[Hungarian Crown]]" made for [[John II Sigismund Zápolya]] according to [[Crown of Saint Stephen]]
* the so-called "[[Homagial Crown|''Homagial'' Crown]]" for receiving [[Commendation ceremony|homage]]s, made for [[Jogaila|Władysław II Jagiełło]]
* the so-called "[[Funeral Crown|''Funebralis'' Crown]]" intended for funeral ceremonies of the Polish monarchs, made for [[Stephen Báthory of Poland|Stephen Báthory]]
* three [[sceptre]]s and three silver [[Globus cruciger|orbs]]
* a silver chain with the relic of the [[Christian cross|holy cross]] (''Crux cum ligno Vitae'')

* the sword of [[Bolesław the Bold]]
* the sword of [[Sigismund I the Old]]
* three hats fringed with pearls
* a large chest with jewel boxes, which contained a large ruby, a {{convert|0.94|carat|mg}} diamond, 200 diamonds, a large emerald, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rożek|1987|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="crowns_angelfire"&gt;{{cite web  |author = Margaret Odrowaz-Sypniewska |url = http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/polcrt/Crowns.html |title = POLAND'S CROWNS |work = www.angelfire.com |publisher =  |pages =  |page =  |date = |accessdate = 2009-02-16|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Michał Myśliński | coauthors = | title = Klejnoty Rzeczypospolitej.

Also a private treasury of the [[House of Vasa|Vasa]]s (kept at the [[Royal Castle in Warsaw]]) consisted of:
* the "[[Swedish Crown]]" made for King [[Sigismund II Augustus]]
* the "[[Muscovy Crown]]" made in about 1610 for Prince Władysław Vasa's coronation as a Tsar of Russia
* a silver [[Coat of arms of Poland|White Eagle]] heraldic base for the royal crown (pure silver, partly gilded, 89&amp;nbsp;cm heigh); the eagle was created for King [[John II Casimir]] in [[Augsburg]] by Abraham Drentwett and Heinrich Mannlich in about 1666; presented in the times of a military weakness of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth after the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]] and lost war against the [[Ottoman Empire]] to Tsar of Russia by King [[Michael Korybut Wiśniowiecki|Michael Korybut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author = Barry Shifman |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_4_160/ai_79030147/pg_5 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080105125729/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_4_160/ai_79030147/pg_5 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2008-01-05 |format= |title = Gifts to the czars |work = findarticles.com |publisher = Magazine Antiques |pages =  |page =  |date = October 2001 |accessdate = 2009-02-16}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1697 a [[Freiburg]] goldsmith Johann Friedrich Klemm executed a replacement for the regalia, known as the [[Crown of Augustus II the Strong]] and intended for his coronation as a King of Poland.&lt;ref name="rozek2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rożek|1987|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was never used however, because two monks broke into the State Treasury in the Wawel Castle and stole the original regalia.&lt;ref name="rozek2" /&gt; The Augustus II Crown is kept in the Dresden Armory.&lt;ref name="rozek2" /&gt;

All of the original crown regalia were looted by the Prussians (except for the "Muscovy Crown") in 1795 after the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]] of the Commonwealth and destroyed on the order of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] in March 1809 (except for the Szczerbiec).&lt;ref name="crowns_angelfire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author =  |url = http://www.wawel.krakow.pl/en/index.php?op=8,1,5 |format= |title = Crown Treasury and Armoury |work = www.wawel.krakow.pl |publisher = |pages =  |page =  |date = |accessdate = 2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 Polish Government purchased the [[silver]] regalia of King [[Augustus III]] and Queen [[Maria Josepha]] in [[Vienna]] for $35,000 (175,000 zł). It consisted of two [[Crown (headgear)|crown]]s, two [[sceptre]]s and two [[globus cruciger|orb]]s made in about 1733. The original ''Crown Regalia'' were hidden by Franciszek Maksymilian Ossoliński during the [[War of the Polish Succession]].&lt;ref name="lileyko2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lileyko|1987|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jewels were exhibited in [[Warsaw]] until 1939 and in 1940 they were stolen by German forces.&lt;ref name="lileyko2" /&gt; Later they were found by the Soviet troops in [[Germany]] and sent to the [[USSR]] where they remained until 1960, when they were returned to Poland.&lt;ref name="lileyko2" /&gt; Today they are deposited in the [[National Museum in Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Karol Estreicher | coauthors = | title = The Mystery of the Polish Crown Jewels | year = 1945 | editor = | page = 25| chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher = Alliance Press Limited | location = | isbn = | url = | format = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "shoestring organization" with "offices mainly on [Joseph J. Mangano's] kitchen table"&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; was established to examine the relationships between low-level nuclear radiation and public health and question the [[Nuclear safety in the United States|safety of nuclear power]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

As of November 2010, Radiation and Public Health Project members have published 27 medical journal articles on health risks from radioactive exposures to nuclear reactors and weapons tests.  RPHP studies have claimed elevated rates of childhood, thyroid, and other cancers near reactors.

According to a 2003 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the group's work has been controversial, and had little credibility with the scientific establishment.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Similarly the work of the Radiation and Public Health Project has been criticized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission:&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/tooth-fairy.html|title=Backgrounder on Radiation Protection and the "Tooth Fairy" Issue|publisher=U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission|date=2010-02-17|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies do not support the RPHP's claims. NRC finds there is little or no credibility in the RHP's studies". In an April 2014 article in Popular Science, Sarah Epstein referred to the group's work as "[[junk science]]" and disputed the group's peer-reviewed publications as being insufficiently evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/what-can-we-do-about-junk-science-16674140|title=What Can We Do About Junk Science|date=2014-04-08|publisher=Popular Science|author=Sarah Epstein|accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Baby teeth ==
A set of 85,000 teeth that had been collected by Dr. [[Louise Reiss]] and her colleagues as part of the [[Baby Tooth Survey]] were uncovered in 2001 and given to the Radiation and Public health Project. By tracking the individuals who had participated in the tooth-collection project, the RHPR published results in a 2010 issue of the ''International Journal of Health Service'' that claimed that those children who later died of cancer before the age of 50 had levels of [[strontium 90]] in their stored baby teeth that was twice the level of those who were still alive at 50.&lt;ref&gt;Hevesi, Dennis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/science/10reiss.html "Dr. Louise Reiss, Who Helped Ban Atomic Testing, Dies at 90"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 10, 2011. Accessed January 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wald, Matthew L. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/health/14cancer.html "Study of Baby Teeth Sees Radiation Effects"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 13, 2010. Accessed January 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was criticized by Stephen Musolino, a health physicist and specialist in radiation protection at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], as it "confuses [[correlation]] with [[Causality|causation]]" and in their opinion the authors of the paper are "ice-cream [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/health/decades-later-baby-tooth-survey-legacy-lives-on/article_c5ad9492-fd75-5aed-897f-850fbdba24ee.html Decades later, Baby Tooth Survey legacy lives on By JEFFREY TOMICH  Aug 1, 2013. St.Louis Post-Dispatch]&lt;/ref&gt;

RPHP studied 5,000 [[baby teeth]], the results of which were published in 5 medical journal articles.  High and rising levels of [[strontium-90]] in baby teeth were found near reactors.

The [[National Cancer Institute]], [[National Institutes of Health]], [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] and nuclear industry groups responded with statements that the study was flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nei.org/resourcesandstats/documentlibrary/safetyandsecurity/factsheet/scienceonradiationhealtheffectsdispelstoothfairyproject/|title=Peer-Reviewed Science on Radiation Health Effects Dispels ‘Tooth Fairy Project’|date=August 2010|publisher=[[Nuclear Energy Institute]]|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups stated that the study suffered from small sample sizes; no control populations; no other cancer risk factors considered; no environmental sampling and analysis; [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] of data to fit the conclusion; and an incorrect [[half-life]] used for strontium-90. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not changed its opinion that there is no excess cancer risk from living near nuclear facilities.&lt;ref name="NRC" /&gt;

==Leukemia study==

== Fukushima ==
After the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]], Mangano and Sherman published several articles claiming detrimental health effects in America caused by fallout from Japan:

In a June 2011 article in [[CounterPunch]], they claimed a 35% increase in infant mortality on the West coast of the United States in the 10 weeks after the disaster, vs the 4 weeks prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/06/10/is-the-increase-in-baby-deaths-in-the-us-a-result-of-fukushima-fallout/print|title=Is the Increase in Baby Deaths in the US a Result of Fukushima Fallout?|website=CounterPunch.org|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael Moyer of [[Scientific American]] stated that their claims are "critically flawed—if not deliberate mistruths", pointing out that this increase only appears [[Cherry picking|when choosing these specific time periods]], and there is no trend in the overall numbers for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/are-babies-dying-in-the-pacific-northwest-due-to-fukushima-a-look-at-the-numbers/|title=Are Babies Dying in the Pacific Northwest Due to Fukushima?

In January 2012, they claimed that fallout from Fukushima resulted in 13,983 excess deaths in the United States in the 14 weeks following the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mangano|first=Joseph J.|last2=Sherman|first2=Janette D.|date=2012-01-01|title=An unexpected mortality increase in the United States follows arrival of the radioactive plume from Fukushima: is there a correlation?|journal=International Journal of Health Services: Planning, Administration, Evaluation|volume=42|issue=1|pages=47–64|issn=0020-7314|pmid=22403909|doi=10.2190/hs.42.1.f}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study was criticized for including different numbers of cities in the "before" and "after" categories,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Körblein|first=Alfred|date=2012-01-01|title=Response to "An unexpected mortality increase in the United States follows arrival of the radioactive plume from Fukushima: is there a correlation"?|journal=International Journal of Health Services: Planning, Administration, Evaluation|volume=42|issue=3|pages=553–555; discussion 561–570|issn=0020-7314|pmid=22993969|quote=The reason for the observed increase is that the data before and after Fukushima differ. ...

In a March 2013 article, published in the ''[[Open Journal of Pedriatrics]]'', they claimed a 16% increase in cases of [[congenital hypothyroidism]] (CH) in 5 US states in the 10 months following the disaster.

      <comment>The expression for Ri did not match the linked expression in reference [1]. The original expression had a vector divided by a scalar, which can't give a scalar. Also, grad(u) is *not* a shear term.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5425">The '''Richardson number''' ('''Ri''') is named after [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] (1881–1953).  It is the [[dimensionless number]] that expresses the ratio of the [[buoyancy]] term to the [[flow velocity|flow]] [[shear (fluid)|shear]] term:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/502698/Richardson-number Encyclopædia Britannica: Richardson number]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathrm{Ri} = \frac{\text{buoyancy term}}{\text{flow shear term}} = \frac{g}{\rho} \frac{\partial \rho/\partial z}{(\partial u / \partial z)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is [[gravitational acceleration|gravity]], &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is density, and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is a representative flow speed.

The Richardson number, or one of several variants, is of practical importance in weather forecasting and in investigating density and turbidity currents in oceans, lakes, and reservoirs.

When considering flows in which density differences are small (the
[[Boussinesq approximation (buoyancy)|Boussinesq approximation]]), it is common to use the [[Boussinesq approximation (buoyancy)#Advantages|reduced gravity]]
''g' '' and the relevant parameter is the densimetric Richardson number

:&lt;math&gt; 
\mathrm{Ri} = \frac{g'}{\rho} \frac{\partial \rho/\partial z}{(\partial u / \partial z)^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is used frequently when considering atmospheric or oceanic flows.

If the Richardson number is much less than unity, [[buoyancy]] is unimportant
in the flow.  If it is much greater than unity, buoyancy is dominant (in
the sense that there is insufficient [[kinetic energy]] to homogenize the fluids).

If the Richardson number is of order unity, then the flow is likely to
be buoyancy-driven: the energy of the flow derives from the [[potential energy]] in the system originally.

== Aviation ==
In [[aviation]], the Richardson number is used as a rough measure of expected air turbulence. A lower value indicates a higher degree of turbulence. Values in the range 10 to 0.1 are typical, with values below unity indicating significant turbulence.

== Thermal convection ==

In thermal convection problems, Richardson number represents the importance of [[natural convection]] relative to the [[forced convection]]. The Richardson number in this context is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Ri} = \frac{g \beta (T_\text{hot} - T_\text{ref})L}{V^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is the gravitational acceleration, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal expansion coefficient]], ''T''&lt;sub&gt;hot&lt;/sub&gt; is the hot wall temperature, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; is the reference temperature, ''L'' is the characteristic length, and ''V'' is the characteristic velocity.

The Richardson number can also be expressed by using a combination of the [[Grashof number]] and [[Reynolds number]],

: &lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{Ri} = \frac{\mathrm{Gr}}{\mathrm{Re}^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Typically, the natural convection is negligible when Ri &lt; 0.1, forced convection is negligible when Ri &gt; 10, and neither is negligible when 0.1 &lt; Ri &lt; 10. It may be noted that usually the forced convection is large relative to natural convection except in the case of extremely low forced flow velocities. However, buoyancy often plays a significant role in defining the laminar–turbulent transition of a [[mixed convection]] flow.&lt;ref name="Garbrecht"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/718097/files/718097.pdf | title= Large eddy simulation of three-dimensional mixed convection on a vertical plate |first1= Oliver |last1=Garbrecht | publisher=[[RWTH Aachen University]] |date= August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the design of water filled thermal energy storage tanks, the Richardson number can be useful.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Huhn ''Beitrag zur thermodynamischen Analyse und Bewertung von Wasserwärmespeichern in Energieumwandlungsketten'', {{ISBN|978-3-940046-32-1}}, Andreas Oberhammer ''Europas größter Fernwärmespeicher in Kombination mit dem optimalen Ladebetrieb eines Gas- und Dampfturbinenkraftwerkes'' (Vortrag 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oceanography ==
In [[oceanography]], the Richardson number has a more general form which takes stratification into account. It is a measure of relative importance of mechanical and density effects in the water column, as described by the [[Taylor–Goldstein equation]], used to model [[Kelvin–Helmholtz instability]] which is driven by sheared flows.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ri}  = N^2/(\mathrm{d}u/\mathrm{d}z)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the [[Brunt–Väisälä frequency]].

The Richardson number defined above is always considered positive. A negative value of ''N²'' (i.e. [[complex number|complex]] ''N'') indicates unstable density gradients with active convective overturning.  Under such circumstances the magnitude of negative Ri is not generally of interest.  It can be shown that Ri &lt; 1/4 is a necessary condition for velocity shear to overcome the tendency of a stratified fluid to remain stratified, and some mixing (turbulence) will generally occur. When Ri is large, turbulent mixing across the stratification is generally suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;A good reference on this subject is {{cite book |first=J. S. |last=Turner |title=Buoyancy Effects in Fluids |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-521-08623-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its title became the name of a new Danish style of arts and crafts, to rival [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Jugendstil]].&lt;ref name=Rekkali&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rekkali |first1=Zeynep |title=Danish Design: The birth, rise, fall and resurrection |url=https://danish.tm/article/danish-design-birth-rise-fall-resurrection/ |publisher=Danish |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1930s, designers such as [[Alvar Aalto]] (furniture, textiles),&lt;ref name=SD&gt;{{cite web |title=Scandinavian design |url=https://www.scandinavia-design.fr/design-scandinave_en.html |publisher=Scandinavia design |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arne Jacobsen]] (chairs),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; [[Borge Mogensen]] (furniture),&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; [[Hans J.

The [[Lunning Prize]], awarded to outstanding Scandinavian designers between 1951 and 1970, was instrumental in making Scandinavian design a recognized commodity, and in defining its profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krondahl |first1=Hans |title=Tema Lunning Prize winners |url=http://runeberg.org/tema/lunning.html |publisher=Runeberg |accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the [[Brooklyn Museum]] held its "Design in Scandinavia" exhibition, and a fashion for "Scandinavian Modern" furniture began in America.&lt;ref name=Rekkali/&gt;{{sfn|Englund|Schmidt|Wood|2007}}{{sfn|Halén|Wickman|2003}} Scandinavian design is by no means limited to furniture and household goods.

The concept of Scandinavian design has been the subject of scholarly debate, exhibitions and marketing agendas since the 1950s. Many emphasize the democratic design ideals that were a central theme of the movement and are reflected in the rhetoric surrounding contemporary Scandinavian and international design. Others, however, have analyzed the reception of Scandinavian design abroad, seeing in it a form of myth-making and racial politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leary, Erin |title='The Total Absence of Foreign Subjects': The Racial Politics of US Interwar Exhibitions of Scandinavian Design |journal=Design and Culture |date=2015 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=283–312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Danish design}}

Danish Design is a style of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalistic]] design and architecture that was developed in mid-20th century. Influenced by the German [[Bauhaus]] school, many [[Danish people|Danish]] designers used the new industrial technologies, combined with ideas of simplicity and functionalism to design buildings, furniture and household objects, many of which have become iconic and are still in use and production, such as [[Arne Jacobsen]]'s 1958 [[Egg (chair)|Egg chair]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egg Chair|url=http://www.aram.co.uk/egg-chair.html|publisher=Aram|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Poul Henningsen]]'s 1926 [[PH-lamp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/design/the-ph-lamp.htm |  title=The PH lamp |  publisher=Visit Denmark |  deadurl=yes |  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215054112/http://www.visitdenmark.com/uk/en-gb/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/design/the-ph-lamp.htm |  archivedate=2012-02-15 |  df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Second World War]], conditions in Denmark were ideally suited to success in design. The emphasis was on furniture but [[architecture]], silver, ceramics, [[glass]] and textiles also benefitted from the trend. Denmark's [[late industrialisation]] combined with a tradition of high-quality [[Artisan|craftsmanship]] formed the basis of gradual progress towards industrial production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.netpublikationer.dk/UM/8584/pdf/Furniture20and20Indust43D234.pdf | title=Furniture and Industrial Design | publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Denmark| accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

===In Iceland===

Design in Iceland is a relatively young tradition, starting in the 1950s but now growing rapidly. The country's limited options for manufacturing and its constrained choice of materials have both forced designers to be innovative, though wool remains a staple material, whether felted or knitted. Iceland's Museum of Design and Applied Art, aiming to record Icelandic design from 1900 onwards, opened in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Design and Architecture {{!}} General information |url=http://www.icelanddesign.is/ICELANDICDESIGN/ |publisher=Iceland Design Centre |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iceland Academy of the Arts was also founded in 1998, soon followed by  its Faculty of Architecture and Design, which has promoted a distinctively Icelandic character in the nation's design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iceland Design Centre |url=http://www.icelanddesign.is/ICELANDDESIGNCENTRE/ |publisher=Iceland Design Centre |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

Swedish design is considered minimalist, with an emphasis on functionality and simple clean lines. This has applied especially to furniture. Sweden is known for traditional crafts including glass and [[Sami people|Sami]] handicrafts. Swedish design was pioneered by [[Anders Beckman]] (graphics), [[Bruno Mathsson]] (furniture), [[Märta Måås-Fjetterström]] and [[Astrid Sampe]] (textile), and [[Sixten Sason]] (industrial). Organisations that promote design in Sweden are [[Svensk Form]], the Swedish society of crafts and design, founded in 1845; the [[Swedish Industrial Design Foundation]], known as SVID; the [[Swedish Arts Council]]; and the [[Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design]] (known as ArkDes) on the island of [[Skeppsholmen]] in Stockholm, beside the [[Moderna Museet|modern art museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stylish functionality |url=https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/swedish-design/|publisher=Sweden.se |accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shemaryahu Talmon''' ([[Hebrew]]: שמריהו טלמון) (born '''Shemaryahu Zelmanowicz'''; 1920 in Skierniewice, [[Poland]] &amp;ndash; December 15, 2010) was J. L. Magnes Professor of Bible at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], known particularly for his work in the [[Hebrew University Bible Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bib-arch.org/news/talmon-obit.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401203852/http://www.bib-arch.org/news/talmon-obit.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 1, 2011|title=Shemaryahu Talmon (1920–2010)|date=February 18, 2011|publisher=Biblical Archaeology Review Magazine|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Early life==

Talmon was born in [[Poland]] in 1920, growing up and studying in the city of Breslau (which was then in Germany).   He was educated at the Jüdisches Reform-Real Gymnasium in [[Breslau]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hartman Institute Mourns Passing of Prof. Shemaryahu Talmon|url=http://www.hartman.org.il/SHINews_View.asp?Article_Id=599&amp;Cat_Id=303&amp;Cat_Type=SHINews|publisher=Hartman Institute|accessdate=22 May 2012|date=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jonathan Ben-Dov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: Shemaryahu Talmon (1920–2010)|url=http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?ArticleId=869|publisher=Society of Biblical Literature|accessdate=22 May 2012|author=Jonathan Ben-Dov}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a detainee at [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] during the [[Holocaust]]. During that time his parents and two sisters were killed, he managed to emigrate to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

He obtained a PhD from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1956.  His thesis was on the text and versions of the [[Tanakh]], especially "double meanings" in Biblical texts.  He subsequently extended and refined his thesis, and contributed to many areas of biblical study.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Ben-Dov"/&gt;

==Religious work==
He worked with [[Moshe Goshen-Gottstein]] and [[Chaim Rabin]] on the [[Hebrew University Bible Project]], and after their deaths served as its editor in chief.  His work helped to advance the understanding of the biblical text, especially the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].   He combined his interest in the scrolls and sociology to study the nature and history of the "community of the renewed covenant."&lt;ref name="Jonathan Ben-Dov"/&gt;

In interfaith activities he was a leader in international Jewish-Christian dialogue, working with the [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[Holy See|Vatican]].  In the area of Biblical education, he was director for educational institutions in the Immigration Camps in Cyprus (1947–48). He taught at the major Israeli universities and been a visiting professor at many institutions throughout the world. He was the rector of the [[University of Haifa]] and of the Institute of Judaic Studies at the College of Jewish Studies at Heidelberg, dean of the Faculty of Humanities at the Hebrew University.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Ben-Dov"/&gt;

In December 2008, Talmon donated a library of 10,000 volumes, mostly in Biblical studies, to the [[Shalom Hartman Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartman.org.il/Publication_Bookshelf_View_Eng.asp?Article_Id=259|title=Talmon book collection inaugurated at well-attended event|date=4 January 2009|publisher=[[Shalom Hartman Institute]]|accessdate=2009-09-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012144625/http://www.hartman.org.il/Publication_Bookshelf_View_Eng.asp?Article_Id=259|archivedate=12 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
His publications include "Qumran and the History of the Biblical Text" (1975), "King, Cult, and Calendar" (1986), "Gesellschaft und Literatur in der Hebräischen Bibel" (1988), "The World of Qumran from Within" (1989) and hundreds of articles in scholarly journals.

== Awards ==
In 1997, Talmon was awarded the [[Israel Prize]], for Biblical studies.&lt;ref name=prize&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site - Recipients in 1997 (in Hebrew)| url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/TashnagTashsab/TASNAG_TASNAT_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashnaz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Solonoid valves.jpg|thumb|Solenoid valves.]]
A '''solenoid valve''' is an [[electromechanical]] device in which the [[solenoid]] uses an [[electric current]] to generate a [[magnetic field]] and thereby operate a [[Mechanism_(engineering)|mechanism]] which regulates the opening of fluid flow in a [[valve]].

Solenoid valves differ in the characteristics of the electric current they use, the strength of the magnetic field they generate, the mechanism they use to regulate the fluid, and the type and characteristics of fluid they control. The mechanism varies from linear action, plunger-type [[actuator|actuators]] to pivoted-armature actuators and rocker actuators. The valve can use a two-port design to regulate a flow or use a three or more port design to switch flows between ports. Multiple solenoid valves can be placed together on a [[Hydraulic manifold|manifold]].

Solenoid valves are the most frequently used control elements in [[fluidics]]. Their tasks are to shut off, release, dose, distribute or mix fluids. They are found in many application areas. Solenoids offer fast and safe switching, high reliability, long service life, good medium compatibility of the materials used, low control power and compact design.

== Operation ==
There are many valve design variations. Ordinary valves can have many ports and fluid paths. A 2-way valve, for example, has 2 ports; if the valve is '''open''', then the two ports are connected and fluid may flow between the ports; if the valve is '''closed''', then ports are isolated. If the valve is open when the solenoid is not energized, then the valve is termed '''normally open''' (N.O.). Similarly, if the valve is closed when the solenoid is not energized, then the valve is termed '''normally closed'''.&lt;ref name="ASCO 2-way"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-1%20General%20Service%202-Way%20Valves.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201311/http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-1%20General%20Service%202-Way%20Valves.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also 3-way and more complicated designs.&lt;ref name="controlandpower.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-9%20Engineering%20Information.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225122854/http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-9%20Engineering%20Information.pdf |archive-date=25 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 3-way valve has 3 ports; it connects one port to either of the two other ports (typically a supply port and an exhaust port).

Solenoid valves are also characterized by how they operate. A small solenoid can generate a limited force. If that force is sufficient to open and close the valve, then a '''direct acting''' solenoid valve is possible. An approximate relationship between the required solenoid force ''F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', the fluid pressure ''P'', and the orifice area ''A'' for a direct acting solenoid valve is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asconumatics.eu/images/site/upload/_en/pdf1/00022gb.pdf |format=PDF|page=V030-1|title=The relation ignores the dynamic head|website=Asconumatics.eu|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F_s = P A = P \pi d^2 / 4&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''d'' is the orifice diameter. A typical solenoid force might be {{convert|15|N|abbr=on}}. An application might be a low pressure (e.g., {{convert|10|psi|abbr=on}}) gas with a small orifice diameter (e.g., {{convert|3/8|in|mm|abbr=on}} for an orifice area of {{convert|0.11|in2|m2|abbr=on}} and approximate force of {{convert|1.1|lbf|N|abbr=on}}).

[[File:Pneumatic Rack and Pinion Actuators.JPG|thumb|The solenoid valve (small black box at the top of the photo) with input air line (small green tube) used to actuate a larger [[rack and pinion]] [[actuator]] (gray box) which controls the water pipe valve.]]
When high pressures and large orifices are encountered, then high forces are required. To generate those forces, an '''internally piloted''' solenoid valve design may be possible.&lt;ref name="ASCO 2-way"/&gt; In such a design, the line pressure is used to generate the high valve forces; a small solenoid controls how the line pressure is used. Internally piloted valves are used in dishwashers and irrigation systems where the fluid is water, the pressure might be {{convert|80|psi|abbr=on}} and the orifice diameter might be {{convert|3/4|in|mm|abbr=on}}.

In some solenoid valves the solenoid acts directly on the main valve. Others use a small, complete solenoid valve, known as a pilot, to actuate a larger valve. While the second type is actually a solenoid valve combined with a pneumatically actuated valve, they are sold and packaged as a single unit referred to as a solenoid valve. Piloted valves require much less power to control, but they are noticeably slower. Piloted solenoids usually need full power at all times to open and stay open, where a direct acting solenoid may only need full power for a short period of time to open it, and only low power to hold it.

A direct acting solenoid valve typically operates in 5 to 10 milliseconds. The operation time of a piloted valve depends on its size; typical values are 15 to 150 milliseconds.&lt;ref name="controlandpower.com"/&gt;

Power consumption and supply requirements of the solenoid vary with application, being primarily determined by fluid pressure and line diameter. For example, a popular 3/4" 150 psi sprinkler valve, intended for 24 VAC (50 - 60 Hz) residential systems, has a momentary inrush of 7.2 VA, and a holding power requirement of 4.6 VA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/pdfImages/d6/d6964dee-5165-4616-b043-0eb0e7a765c6.pdf|title = Orbit 3/4 150 PSI Sprinkler|date = |accessdate = 9 Dec 2015|website = homedepot|publisher = Home Depot|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively, an industrial 1/2" 10000 psi valve, intended for 12, 24, or 120 VAC systems in high pressure fluid and cryogenic applications, has an inrush of 300 VA and a holding power of 22 VA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.omega.com/green/pdf/SVH-110.pdf|title = Omega High Pressure Solenoid Valve SVH-111/SVH-112 Series|date = |accessdate = 9 Dec 2015|website = omega|publisher = Omega|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither valve lists a minimum pressure required to remain closed in the un-powered state.

===Internally piloted===
While there are multiple design variants, the following is a detailed breakdown of a typical solenoid valve design.

A solenoid valve has two main parts: the solenoid and the valve.  The solenoid converts electrical energy into mechanical energy which, in turn, opens or closes the valve mechanically. A direct acting valve has only a small flow circuit, shown within section '''E''' of this diagram (this section is mentioned below as a pilot valve).  In this example, a diaphragm piloted valve multiplies this small pilot flow, by using it to control the flow through a much larger orifice.  

Solenoid valves may use metal seals or rubber seals, and may also have electrical interfaces to allow for easy control.  A [[Spring (device)|spring]] may be used to hold the valve opened (normally open) or closed (normally closed) while the valve is not activated.
[[Image:Solenoid Valve.svg|thumbnail|right|360px| A- Input side&lt;BR&gt;
B- Diaphragm&lt;BR&gt;
C- Pressure chamber&lt;BR&gt;
D- Pressure relief passage&lt;BR&gt;
E- Electro Mechanical Solenoid&lt;BR&gt;
F- Output side]]

The diagram to the right shows the design of a basic valve, controlling the flow of water in this example. At the top figure is the valve in its closed state.  The water under pressure enters at '''A'''. '''B''' is an elastic diaphragm and above it is a weak spring pushing it down.  The diaphragm has a pinhole through its center which allows a very small amount of water to flow through it. This water fills the cavity '''C''' on the other side of the diaphragm so that pressure is equal on both sides of the diaphragm, however the compressed spring supplies a net downward force. The spring is weak and is only able to close the inlet because water pressure is equalized on both sides of the diaphragm.

Once the diaphragm closes the valve, the pressure on the outlet side of its bottom is reduced, and the greater pressure above holds it even more firmly closed.  Thus, the spring is irrelevant to holding the valve closed.

The above all works because the small drain passage '''D''' was blocked by a pin which is the armature of the [[solenoid]] '''E''' and which is pushed down by a spring.  If current is passed through the solenoid, the pin is withdrawn via magnetic force, and the water in chamber ''C'' drains out the passage ''D'' faster than the pinhole can refill it.  The pressure in chamber '''C''' drops and the incoming pressure lifts the diaphragm, thus opening the main valve. Water now flows directly from '''A''' to '''F'''.  

When the solenoid is again deactivated and the passage '''D''' is closed again, the spring needs very little force to push the diaphragm down again and the main valve closes. In practice there is often no separate spring; the elastomer diaphragm is molded so that it functions as its own spring, preferring to be in the closed shape.

From this explanation it can be seen that this type of valve relies on a differential of pressure between input and output as the pressure at the input must always be greater than the pressure at the output for it to work.  Should the pressure at the output, for any reason, rise above that of the input then the valve would open regardless of the state of the solenoid and pilot valve.

Solenoid valve designs have many variations and challenges.

The core or plunger is the magnetic component that moves when the solenoid is energized. The core is coaxial with the solenoid. The core's movement will make or break the seals that control the movement of the fluid. When the coil is not energized, springs will hold the core in its normal position.

The plugnut is also coaxial.&lt;!-- explain reason for plugnut; why not just one longer core. --&gt;

The core tube contains and guides the core. It also retains the plugnut and may seal the fluid. To optimize the movement of the core, the core tube needs to be nonmagnetic.  If the core tube were magnetic, then it would offer a shunt path for the field lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skinner Valve|1997|p=128}}, stating "The tube is made of non-magnetic material to make certain that the flux is directed through the plunger rather than around it."&lt;/ref&gt; In some designs, the core tube is an enclosed metal shell produced by [[deep drawing]]. Such a design simplifies the sealing problems because the fluid cannot escape from the enclosure, but the design also increases the magnetic path resistance because the magnetic path must traverse the thickness of the core tube twice: once near the plugnut and once near the core. In some other designs, the core tube is not closed but rather an open tube that slips over one end of the plugnut. To retain the plugnut, the tube might be crimped to the plugnut. An O-ring seal between the tube and the plugnut will prevent the fluid from escaping.

The solenoid coil consists of many turns of copper wire that surround the core tube and induce the movement of the core. The coil is often encapsulated in epoxy.  The coil also has an iron frame that provides a low magnetic path resistance.&lt;!-- explain this more. Force related to size of the gap. --&gt;
&lt;!-- AC/DC issues --&gt;

===Materials===
The valve body must be compatible with the fluid; common materials are brass, stainless steel, aluminum, and plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Skinner Valve |title=Two-Way, Three-Way and Four-Way Solenoid Valves |id=Catalog CFL00897 |publisher=[[Parker Hannifin]] |year=1997 |url=http://www.surmaq.com/html/cata/parker/contr/skinner.pdf }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p.&amp;nbsp;128&lt;/ref&gt;

The seals must be compatible with the fluid.

To simplify the sealing issues, the plugnut, core, springs, shading ring, and other components are often exposed to the fluid, so they must be compatible as well. The requirements present some special problems. The core tube needs to be non-magnetic to pass the solenoid's field through to the plugnut and the core. The plugnut and core need a material with good magnetic properties such as iron, but iron is prone to corrosion. [[Stainless steel]]s can be used because they come in both magnetic and non-magnetic varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.controlandpower.com/catalog/PDFs/ASCO/ASCO%2035-9%20Engineering%20Information.pdf|format=PDF|page=450f|title=States, "Internal parts in contact with fluids are of non-magnetic 300 and magnetic 400 series stainless steel."|website=Controlandpower.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a solenoid valve might use 304 stainless steel for the body, 305 stainless steel for the core tube, 302 stainless steel for the springs, and 430 F stainless steel (a magnetic stainless steel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matweb.com/search/datasheettext.aspx?matguid=d1fcb0f0cca340a4aa9068d6af5e6606|title=Crucible Steel 430F Stainless Steel|website=Matweb.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for the core and plugnut.&lt;ref name="ASCO 2-way"/&gt;

== Types ==
Many variations are possible on the basic, one-way, one-solenoid valve described above:
* one- or two-solenoid valves;
* [[direct current]] or [[alternating current]] powered;
* different number of ways and positions;

==Common uses==
Solenoid valves are used in [[fluid power]] pneumatic and hydraulic systems, to control cylinders, fluid power motors or larger industrial valves. Automatic [[irrigation sprinkler]] systems also use solenoid valves with an automatic [[Controller (irrigation)|controller]]. Domestic [[washing machine]]s and [[dishwasher]]s use solenoid valves to control water entry into the machine. They are also often used in paintball gun triggers to actuate the CO2 hammer valve. Solenoid valves are usually referred to simply as "solenoids." 

Solenoid valves can be used for a wide array of industrial applications, including general on-off control, calibration and test stands, pilot plant control loops, process control systems, and various original equipment manufacturer applications. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valcor.com/scientific-and-industrial/general-purpose-solenoid-valves/|title=General Purpose Solenoid Valves - Valcor Engineering|website=Valcor.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spatial network analysis software''' packages are computer tools used to prepare various [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]-based analysis of [[spatial network]]s.  They stem from various research fields in transportation, architecture and urban planning. The earliest examples of spatial network analysis using computers include the work of Garrison (1962), Kansky (1963), Levin (1964), Harary (1969), Rittel (1967), Tabor (1970) and others in the 1960s and 70s. Various fields of study have later developed specific spatial analysis software to suit their needs, including TransCAD among transportation researchers, GIS among planners and geographers, Axman among Space Syntax researchers, and various plugins for other software platforms. The list below gives and overview of some of the available software. Many of these were developed in academia and are freely available or freely available for academic research.

In historical order:

* '''[http://www.spacesyntax.org/software/macbundle.asp Axman]''' The (near) original developed by Nick Sheep Dalton of [[University College London|UCL]] to perform axial line analysis on computers running [[Mac OS]], currently used in more than 50 countries.  This spawned many offshoots such as '''Pesh''' (for the analysis of convex space networks) and '''SpaceBox''' (for the analysis of 'all-line' axial maps).

* '''[http://www.spacesyntax.org/software/newtools.asp Confeego]''' Developed by the commercial company [http://www.spacesyntax.com Space Syntax Limited], but available free for academic use, this software plugs directly into [[MapInfo Professional]] to analyse line axial networks.
* '''[http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/ajax/ AJAX]''' by [[Mike Batty]] of UCL, performs both traditional axial network analysis (Batty calls this the ''primal'' analysis), and point-based visibility analysis introduced by Bin Jiang (which Batty calls the ''dual'' analysis).  In a recent paper, Batty shows the elegant mathematical relationship between the two analyses.
* '''OverView''' plug-in to AutoCad by Christian Derix for Aedas Architects in collaboration with the Center for Evolutionary Computing in Architecture [http://www.uel.ac.uk/ceca CECA]. Allows architects to do quick visual integration mapping via [[isovist]] analysis on their projects. Contains also the possibility to analyse non-planar environments to take volumes and hilly sites into account.
* '''AXess 1.0''' by Jennifer Brisbane at the [[City University of New York]].

Free download available at '''[http://arcscripts.esri.com/ ESRI ArcScripts]'''.
* '''[http://www.thepurehands.org/webmapathome/ Webmap-At-Home]''' by Nick Sheep Dalton [[The Open University|OU]].  A Java implementation of the original Axman program with a number of extra features added. This is a platform neutral full application capable of reading DXF files and the original Axman binary format.  Free download available at '''[http://www.thepurehands.org/webmapathome/]'''.
* '''[http://fromto.hig.se/~bjg/AxialGen/ AxialGen]''' by Bin Jiang and Xintao Liu at the [[University of Gävle]], Sweden. It is a plugin to ArcGIS 9.2 that generates automatically the axial lines for a complex polygon with holes.
* '''[http://www.layout-iQ.com/ Layout-iQ 1.0]''' Developed by Nelson Lee at Rapid Modeling. Used extensively in healthcare, manufacturing, banking, retail, and office space, Layout-iQ is a software that evaluates the frequency of flow in a workspace and measures the total travel distance that resources will travel to navigate through the workspace.  The software integrates CAD drawings with a diagram of flow between points.  The thickness and color of the flow lines indicate the intensity of flow in each line, so users can visually see high priority point to point relationships.  As the user moves locations in the diagram, the software dynamically calculates the impact on travel distance and users can immediately see the impact of the change on operations.  The software also allows for the creation of improved aisles and paths using the aisle effectiveness measurement and actual path diagramming.
* '''[http://cityform.mit.edu/projects/urban-network-analysis.html Urban Network Analysis Toolbox for ArcGIS]''' (free, open-source) Developed by the [http://cityform.mit.edu City Form Lab] at [http://sutd.edu.sg SUTD] and [http://web.mit.edu MIT]. The UNA Toolbox can be used to compute five types of graph centrality measures on spatial networks: Reach; Gravity; Betweenness; Closeness; and Straightness. The tools incorporate three important features that make them particularly suited for spatial analysis on urban street networks. First, they can account for both geometry and topology in the input networks, using either metric distance (e.g. Meters) or topological distance (e.g. Turns) as impedance factors in the analysis. Second, unlike previous software tools that operate with two network elements (nodes and edges), the UNA tools include a third network element – buildings – which are used as the spatial units of analysis for all measures. Two neighboring buildings on the same street segments can therefore obtain different accessibility results. And third, the UNA tools optionally allow buildings to be weighted according to their particular characteristics – more voluminous, more populated, or otherwise more important buildings can be specified to have a proportionately stronger effect on the analysis outcomes, yielding more accurate and reliable results to any of the specified measures. The toolbox is built for easy scaling – it is equally suited for small-scale, detailed network analysis of dense urban areas as it is for sparser large-scale regional networks.  The toolbox requires [http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis10/ ArcGIS 10] software with an [http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/extensions/networkanalyst/ ArcGIS Network Analyst Extension].
* '''[http://cityform.mit.edu/projects/una-rhino-toolbox Urban Network Analysis Plugin for Rhinoceros3D]''' (free for both academic and commercial use) Developed by the [http://cityform.mit.edu City Form Lab] at [http://sutd.edu.sg SUTD] and [http://web.mit.edu MIT]. The Rhino UNA Toolbox can be used to compute five types of graph centrality measures on spatial networks: Reach; Gravity; Betweenness; Closeness; and Straightness. The toolbox also include a series of other spatial analysis tools, such as Closest Facility, Alternative Routes finding, pedestrian flow modeling along shortest or redundant paths, facility patronage estimation, spatial distribution of origins weights along routes etc. The tool gives users full control to specify which origins and destinations to use in the analysis and allows the users to weight the analysis with specific attributes of each origin and destination. The UNA Rhino toolbox was developed in order to make spatial network analysis tools available to architects, designers and planners who do not have access to GIS and typically work on designs in Rhino. Having UNA metrics in Rhino, not only allows one to analyze how a specific spatial network performs, but to also incorporate the analysis into a fast and iterative design process, where networks can be designed, evaluated and redesigned in seamless cycles to rapidly improve the outcome.The UNA Rhino toolbox is significantly faster that its GIS counterpart, which has been available as a plugin for ArcGIS since 2012. Users also have an ability to rapidly create and edit networks from any Rhino curve objects, making network design and redesign simple and intuitive. The analytic options available to the user have expanded, giving you more precise control to analyze exactly what you need for every unique spatial network problem.The toolbox requires [https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino/5/latest Rhinoceros version 5] software with the latest updates (SR 10 or later). Help documentation for the UNA Rhino plugin is also available from the City Form Lab [https://www.dropbox.com/s/wqd2nfln87ghri5/20150301_UNA_Rhino3D_HELP.pdf?dl=0 website].
* '''[http://mekandizim.mersin.edu.tr/ SSA Plugin]''' by Burak Beyhan at the Mersin University, Turkey. Space Syntax Analysis (SSA) Plugin is operational on a series of Free and Open Source Software for GIS (FOSS4GIS) including OpenJUMP, gvSIG, OrbisGIS, [[QGIS]], OpenEV, Thuban, MapWindow GIS, SAGA, and also R Project. SSA Plugin calculates the standard space syntax measures including connectivity, total depth, mean depth, global integration, local depth, local integration and control values for each feature involved in a spatial configuration, and intelligibility value for the whole of the configuration. In addition to these parameters, users are also allowed to export adjusted graph created by the plugin to an external file in a Social Network Analysis (SNA) file format for further analysis of the spatial configuration concerned in the respective software environment.
* '''[https://github.com/varoudis/depthmapX depthmapX]''' Developed by Tasos Varoudis of UCL, is [[Open-source software|open source]] [[multi-platform]] [[spatial network]] analyses software based on the original Depthmap. It can generate [[isovist]]s and perform [[visibility graph analysis]] of building systems on computers running [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Linux]], it includes automatic generation of axial line networks and analysis of axial line networks and road segment line networks. depthmapX is based on [[Qt framework]].
* '''[http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/sdna Spatial Design Network Analysis (sDNA 3D)]''' Since 2011, developed by Alain Chiaradia, Crispin Cooper and Chris Webster at Cardiff University and University of Hong Kong, (free) a tool aiming to unify the use of spatial network analysis in the disparate fields of design and research.  To this end, plugins are provided for '''Autocad''' (for designers), '''ArcGIS''', open source '''QGIS''' (for analysts &amp; designers) and a standalone Python version that works on 2D or 3D shapefiles enabling use in other GIS software and custom projects.  sDNA standardizes on the network link as a unit of analysis, and computes a wide variety of closeness, betweenness, severance and efficiency measures. sDNA works with '''3D topography''' and '''3D multilevel environment'''. Analyses and Radius can use Euclidean, angular, topological or custom distance metrics, and link, length or custom weightings. In Angular analysis mode sDNA computes cumulative angular change along the link and angular change at junction resulting in angular geodesic.
* '''[http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/ ORA]''' Developed by Dr. Kathleen M. Carley and the joint Carnegie Mellon University and Netanomics team is a tools that support social and spatial network analysis. It is interoperable with other spatial analysis tools such as ARCGIS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4590">The '''Sussex Manifesto''' was a report on science and technology for development written at the request of the [[United Nations]] and published in 1970.

== History ==

In the late 1960s the United Nations asked for recommendations on science and technology for development &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/science/psd/un_unesco.pdf The rise and fall of S&amp;T on the UN agenda - 60 years of UN and UNESCO, Professor Dr Klaus-Heinrich Standke   Science and Public Policy,  November 2006  ]&lt;/ref&gt; from a team of academics at the [[Institute of Development Studies]] (IDS) and [[SPRU]] [[Science and Technology Policy Research]] (formerly called [[Science Policy Research Unit]]) at the [[University of Sussex]], UK.  This team became known as the Sussex Group and their report, ''Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade'', became known as the ''Sussex Manifesto''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Sussex-Manifesto-IDS-Reprint.pdf The Sussex Manifesto: Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sussex Manifesto'' was intended as the introductory chapter to the ''UN World Plan of Action on Science and Technology for Development''. But the solutions presented in the Manifesto were deemed too radical to be used for that purpose.  It was instead published in 1970 as an annex in ''Science and Technology for Development: Proposals for the Second United Nations Development Decade'', a UN report by the Advisory Committee on the Application of Science and Technology to Development (ACAST).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0192-5121(1982)3%3A3%3C343%3ASATITN%3E2.0.CO%3B2-K ACAST and the introduction of science and technology into the UN system]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sussex Manifesto'' helped raise awareness of science and technology for development &lt;ref&gt;[http://sss.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/3/385.pdf  Science, Technology and Development: Part of a course in Development Studies for first and second year engineering and medical students at the University of Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, David Wield and Carol Barker, Social Studies of Science 1978; 8; 385]&lt;/ref&gt; in UN circles &lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=134280&amp;set=487E2528_2_7&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1 UNESCO’s contribution to Stage 2 of the World Plan of Action for the Application of Science and Technology to Development; science and technology policies and institutions],&lt;/ref&gt; influenced the design of development institutions and was used for teaching courses in both North and South universities.

The Sussex Group were [[Hans Singer]] (Chairman), Charles Cooper (Secretary), R.C. Desai, [[Christopher Freeman]], Oscar Gish, Stephen Hill and Geoffrey Oldham.

== Today ==

In 2008 one of the authors of the original report Professor Geoff Oldham gave a seminar &lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/event/steps-new-manifesto-seminar-geoff-oldham/ Professor Oldham's STEPS Seminar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/news/news-at-ids-the-sussex-manifesto IDS News]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[STEPS Centre]] – a research centre and policy engagement based at IDS and SPRU. Following this event the STEPS Centre decided to create a new manifesto in association its partners around the world and Professor Oldham. The new publication, ''Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/anewmanifesto/wp-content/uploads/steps-manifesto_small-file.pdf Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in 2010, forty years after the original.

The New Manifesto has also been translated into Chinese, French, Portuguese and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/anewmanifesto/publications/manifesto-translated-into-chinese-french-portuguese-and-spanish/ New Manifesto: translated versions]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The STEPS Centre is funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC).

'''The Rutles''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ʌ|t|əl|z}}) are a rock band known for their visual and aural [[pastiche]]s and parodies of [[the Beatles]]. This originally fictional band, created by [[Eric Idle]] and [[Neil Innes]] for 1970s television programming, became an actual group – whilst remaining a parody of the Beatles – which toured and recorded, releasing many songs and albums that included two UK chart hits.

Created as a short sketch in Idle's UK television comedy series ''[[Rutland Weekend Television]]'', the Rutles gained fame after being the focus of the 1978 [[mockumentary]] television film ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' (also known as ''The Rutles''). Former Beatle [[George Harrison]] appeared in the film and assisted in its creation. Encouraged by the positive public reaction to the sketch, featuring Beatles' music pastiches by Innes, the film was written by Idle, who co-directed it with Gary Weis. It had 20 songs written by Innes, which he performed with three musicians as the Rutles. A soundtrack album in 1978 was followed in 1996 by ''Archaeology'', which spoofed the Beatles' recent ''[[Beatles Anthology|Anthology]]'' series.

A second film, ''[[The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch]]'' – modelled on the 2000 TV special ''The Beatles Revolution'' – was made in 2002 and released in the US on DVD in 2003.

==History==

===''Rutland Weekend Television'' (1975–76)===
The Rutles first appeared in 1975 as a [[Sketch comedy|sketch]] on [[Eric Idle]]'s BBC television series ''[[Rutland Weekend Television]]''. The sketch presented a mini-documentary about the 1960s band the Rutles, and featured [[Neil Innes]] (formerly of the [[Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band]], and a frequent [[Monty Python]] collaborator) fronting the band singing "I Must Be In Love", a [[pastiche]] of [[Lennon–McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]]'s 1964 style.

The sketch was the work of Innes and Idle. Innes conceived parodying the film ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', after writing "I Must Be In Love", which he realised sounded very "Beatle-y". Innes was the musician and composer for the series, and routinely created songs and ideas about how those songs could be presented on the show. He passed the idea along of a Beatles spoof to Idle, who had a separate idea about a boring TV documentary maker. They then merged the ideas into one extended film shot for the TV show. The band name was a continuation of the regional premise of the TV show, which was presented as a programme by a fictional TV network in [[Rutland]], the smallest county in England. One running joke was that it would use names derivative of Rutland. The initial idea was a parody of [[the Rolling Stones]] called the Rutland Stones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George C. Perry|title=The Life of Python|page=154|publisher=Pavilion|year=2007|isbn=1-86205-762-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but became a parody of the Beatles, and Idle suggested the Rutles. 'The Prefab Four' is a pun on the Beatles' nickname 'the Fab Four' with an additional subtext: a prefab was a [[Mid-20th-century system-built houses|cheap postwar form of British housing]], intended to be temporary, often poorly constructed, draughty and leaky, and not well-regarded by those who had to live in them.  (The epithet had previously been applied to [[The Monkees]].)

The Rutles had connections with the Beatles aside from the parody. The Beatles were fans of Innes's previous band, the Bonzo Dog Band; they featured them in the 1967 film ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'', and Paul McCartney (working with [[Gus Dudgeon]] under the collective alias Apollo C. Vermouth) had produced the Bonzos' 1968 hit single "[[I'm the Urban Spaceman]]". George Harrison made a guest appearance on ''Rutland Weekend Television''{{'}}s 1975 Boxing Day special, with Idle and Innes, and encouraged them to make a film that parodied the Beatles' career and deflated the myths surrounding the band's legacy.

In merchandising for the TV series, references were made to a Rutles album called ''Finchley Road'' and a single, "Ticket To Rut". In 1976, [[BBC Records]] produced ''[[The Rutland Weekend Songbook]]'', an album containing 23 tracks including the Rutles songs "I Must Be In Love" and "The Children Of Rock And Roll" (later reworked as "Good Times Roll").

===''Saturday Night Live'' (1976)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
One year after their initial BBC appearance, on 2 October 1976 Idle appeared on the American NBC show ''Saturday Night'' (later ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''), and showed videotape extracts from ''Rutland Weekend Television'' – including the Rutles clip. That led to a suggestion by ''SNL'' executive producer [[Lorne Michaels]] to extend the skit into a one-hour mock documentary. This proposal led to the 1978 [[mockumentary]] ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'', directed by ''SNL'' film director Gary Weis, with Idle credited as co-director.

===''Saturday Night Live'' (1977)===
On 23 April 1977, Idle made another appearance on ''Saturday Night Live'', bringing along [[Neil Innes]] as a musical guest. A running theme for this episode is the "Save Great Britain Telethon", and at one point there is an appearance by "the Rutle who lives in New York, Nasty". Innes appeared as Nasty with a lone white piano, singing a short version of "Cheese &amp; Onions". Later in the episode, as Neil Innes, he performed "[[Shangri-La]]", a song subsequently recorded by the Rutles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/76/76t.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Eric Idle: 04/23/77 |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |date=1977-04-23 |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''All You Need Is Cash'', 1978===
{{Main article|All You Need Is Cash}}
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
Written by Idle and Innes, ''All You Need Is Cash'' documents the rise and fall of the Rutles, paralleling much of the history of the Beatles. The project was given extra recognition through Harrison's support. As well as providing ideas, he supplied Idle and Innes with a copy of the Beatles' long-planned documentary, ''The Long and Winding Road''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/movies/homevideo/the-rutles-parody-the-beatles.html&lt;/ref&gt; (eventually re-titled ''[[The Beatles Anthology (documentary)|The Beatles Anthology]]'' and released in 1995). Idle drew inspiration from this 1976 version of the documentary, as compiled by [[Neil Aspinall]], and was granted permission to use some of the archival footage to tell the Rutles' story.

Innes wrote, composed, and produced the music. He relied on his memory of Beatles music, and not careful later analysis, to create sound-alike songs. Innes assembled a band (himself, [[John Halsey (musician)|John Halsey]], [[Ollie Halsall]], Andy Brown, and [[Ricky Fataar]]) and the group played in a London [[pub]] to gel. During Rutles performances and studio recordings, Innes took lead on the songs that resembled Lennon's; Halsall sang on most McCartney-esque tunes; Fataar sang the Harrison songs; and Halsey sang a [[Ringo Starr]]-type song. Idle mimed to Halsall's singing and Brown's bass playing in the completed film. Halsall appeared in the film as "Leppo", the fifth Rutle who in the earliest years "mainly stood at the back". Brown did not appear in the film.

The film is a series of skits and gags that illustrate the Rutles story, following the chronology of the Beatles. The glue of the film is the soundtrack by Innes, who wrote and composed 19 more songs for the film, each a pastiche of a Beatles song or genre. Fourteen songs were on a soundtrack album. The CD version added the six songs omitted from the original [[gramophone record|vinyl]] album. The album was nominated for a [[Grammy]] award for Best Comedy Recording of the year. The orchestrations and arrangements were by film composer [[John Altman (composer)|John Altman]].

''All You Need Is Cash'' was not a success on American television on its first showing on 22 March 1978; indeed, it finished at the bottom of all programmes that week. The show fared better on BBC television when it was premiered a week later, on 27 March 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077147/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ov_inf|title=All You Need Is Cash (1978 TV Movie) : Release Info|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 66-minute version edited for TV was released on video and DVD, but this has been superseded by the restored 72-minute version.

Additional actors in the special included [[Dan Aykroyd]] as the man who turned down the Rutles; [[John Belushi]] as Ron Decline (a parody of [[Allen Klein]]); [[Bill Murray]] as "Bill [[Murray the K]]"; [[Gilda Radner]] as a reluctant street interviewee; [[George Harrison]] as a TV reporter; [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Paul Simon]] as themselves;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/movies/homevideo/the-rutles-parody-the-beatles.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Palin]] as Eric Manchester (a parody of Beatles press agent [[Derek Taylor]]); [[Ron Wood]] as a biker; [[Lorne Michaels]] as a man who wants to merchandise the Rutles; [[Al Franken]] and [[Tom Davis (comedian)|Tom Davis]] as Ron Decline employees; and many others. It included actual footage of [[David Frost]] and [[Ed Sullivan]] taken from TV appearances.

===The Beatles' reaction===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2008}}
* [[George Harrison]] was involved in the project from the beginning. Producer [[Gary Weis]] said, "We were sitting around in Eric's kitchen one day, planning a sequence that really ripped into the mythology and George looked up and said, 'We were the Beatles, you know!' Then he shook his head and said, 'Aw, never mind.' I think he was the only one of the Beatles who really could see the irony of it all."

Harrison said, "The Rutles sort of liberated me from the Beatles in a way. It was the only thing I saw of those Beatles television shows they made. It was actually the best, funniest and most scathing. But at the same time, it was done with the most love."

* [[Ringo Starr]] liked the happier scenes in the film, but felt the scenes that mimicked sadder times hit too close.
* [[John Lennon]] loved the film and refused to return the videotape and soundtrack he was given for approval. He told Innes, however, that "Get Up and Go" was too close to the Beatles' "[[Get Back]]" and to be careful not to be sued by ATV Music, owners of the Beatles catalogue's copyright at the time. The song was consequently omitted from the 1978 vinyl LP soundtrack. 
* [[Paul McCartney]], who had just released his own album, ''[[London Town (Wings album)|London Town]],'' always answered, "No comment." According to Innes: "He had a dinner at some awards thing at the same table as Eric one night and Eric said it was a little frosty." Idle claimed McCartney changed his mind because his wife [[Linda McCartney|Linda]] thought it was funny.

Idle claims on the ''All You Need Is Cash'' DVD commentary track that Harrison and Starr at one point discussed starting a band with Innes and Idle, based on the Beatles' and Rutles's shared and imaginary histories. Harrison and Starr also surprised him and Innes one day by singing a version of the Rutles' "Ouch!"

===Later history===
In 1979, Idle and Fataar issued a single as "Dirk and Stig"—"[[Ging Gang Goolie]]" backed with "Mr. Sheene". This was Idle's only appearance on a Rutles-related disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rutlemania.org/rutles5.html |title=The Rutles - The Lean Years |publisher=Rutlemania.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1980s, the Rutles did not exist.

In 1982, the Rutles were involved in a record scandal reminiscent of the one surrounding the Beatles' ''[[Yesterday and Today]]'' album. Rhino Records, at the time a small Los Angeles label specialising in off-beat releases, released an album that it called ''[[Beatlesongs]]'', purportedly a collection of Beatles novelty songs but actually a weird catch-all of assorted Beatles-related tunes. For the collection, Rhino licensed the Rutles' "Hold My Hand" from Warner Bros Records. The cover of the album was done by well-known commercial artist William Stout, who had made a name for himself drawing the cover artwork for some of the best-looking Beatles bootleg records in the 1970s. His cover drawing included a representation of [[Mark David Chapman]], the man who had killed John Lennon, which generated an immense backlash. Rhino responded by recalling the album and reissuing it with a new, innocuous cover, which they announced in this press release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rutlemania.org/lean3.html |title=The Rutles - The Lean Years - Part 3 |publisher=Rutlemania.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clip from ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' appeared on this compilation of comedy videos put out by the now-defunct [[Vestron Video|Vestron Home Video]] in 1985. The clip is simply the Tragical History Tour part of ''All You Need Is Cash'', with the sound clunkily muted out during the segment's narration in order to leave just the music. This home video release was released on both VHS and Laserdisc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rutlemania.org/lean4.html |title=The Rutles - The Lean Years - Part 4 |publisher=Rutlemania.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innes, with a group called the Moptops backed by the Rutland Symphony Orchestra,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rutlemania.org/rutles6.html |title=Live Rutles |publisher=Rutlemania.org |date= |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed as "Ron Nasty and the New Rutles" at a convention honouring the 25th anniversary of Monty Python in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rutlemania.org/troubador.html |title=An Eyewitness account of Ron Nasty and the New Rutles at the Troubador |publisher=Rutlemania.org |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a Rutles reunion album in 1996, featuring Innes, Fataar and Halsey. Halsall died in 1992, but the reunion album, titled ''Archaeology'' as a play on the Beatles' ''Anthology'' series, featured several tracks recorded in 1978 that included his contributions. The Japanese version included 4 bonus tracks.

In 2002, Idle made ''[[The Rutles 2: Can't Buy Me Lunch]]'', which remained unreleased for a year. The film features an even bigger number of celebrity interviewees discussing the band's influence. This was met with mixed reactions from fans, particularly because no new footage of the Rutles was filmed. The DVD had yet to be released in the UK as of February 2014.

McQuickly and Nasty had cameos in the 2004 [[graphic novel]], ''[[Superman: True Brit]]'', co-written by former [[Monty Python's Flying Circus]] member [[John Cleese]].

In 2007, a reissue of ''Archaeology'' included a new Rutles track called "Rut-a-lot" (a jab at Idle's stage show ''Spamalot'') which was simply a live medley of songs from the first Rutles album.

On 17 March 2008, all four movie Rutles (Innes, Idle, Fataar and Halsey) reunited for the first time at a 30th anniversary screening of ''All You Need Is Cash'' at the [[Egyptian Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]]. The event included a question and answer session and performance by members of the tribute show "Rutlemania" which ran for a week at the Ricardo Montalban Theater in Hollywood before doing a week in NYC at the Blender Gramercy Theater. The "Rutlemania" live show was conceived and written by Eric Idle which starred the Beatles tribute group [[The Fab Four (tribute)|the Fab Four]] as "The Pre-Fab Four" Rutles.

In February 2009, on his website ''InnesBookOfRecords.Com'', Innes released what he refers to as "Ron Nasty's Final Song", titled "Imitation Song", a parody of "Imagine". This was also Innes's first and only entry in the ''Masters of Song-Fu'' competition run by [[Quick Stop Entertainment]].

On 9 February 2014, Idle reprised his narrator persona from ''All You Need Is Cash'' as part of ''[[The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to The Beatles]]'', noting how the Rutles had made their American debut 50 years earlier, and it was an amazing coincidence the Beatles were there the same day. He then lent straight narration to biographical sketches of the Beatles's early lives.

==The band==

===Rutland Weekend Television version (1975–76)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
The Rutles members in the original 1975 skit on ''[[Rutland Weekend Television]]'', which subsequently aired on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', were:
* "Nasty" – [[Neil Innes]]
* "Stig" – [[Ricky Fataar]]
* "Dirk" – [[Eric Idle]]
* "Barry" – [[John Halsey (musician)|John Halsey]]

In the original skit "Stig" is the George Harrison character and was portrayed by Fataar, with Idle portraying the Paul McCartney character as "Dirk". The John Lennon character is named "Nasty". The Ringo Starr character was originally named Barry, although in the series spin-off book ''The Rutland Weekend Songbook'', this character is mistakenly identified as "Kevin"—the only appearance of this name in the entire Rutles canon. In the original sketch, the characters are given only the singular names Stig, Dirk, Barry and Nasty.

Some actors lip-synching the Rutles music on-screen were not musicians, and did not participate in the recording process. Rutles music for ''Rutland Weekend Television'' and the spin-off album ''The Rutland Weekend Songbook'' was recorded by Neil Innes' own band Fatso, which consisted of:
* [[Neil Innes]] – piano, vocal
* [[John Halsey (musician)|John Halsey]] – drums
* [[Roger Rettig]] – guitar
* [[Billy Bremner (musician)|Billy Bremner]] (later of [[Rockpile]] fame) – guitar
* [[Brian Hodgson]] – bass

===''All You Need Is Cash'' version (1978)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
In adapting the characters for a full-length TV feature, several changes were made. Idle continued to play "Dirk", but Dirk was now modelled after Paul McCartney, not George Harrison. Battley was replaced as Stig by [[Ricky Fataar]], and Stig became the George Harrison-inspired character. Additionally, the characters now all had first and last names.

The Rutles members in ''All You Need Is Cash'' were:
* '''Ron Nasty''' (styled after [[John Lennon]]) – played by Neil Innes
* '''Dirk McQuickly''' (styled after [[Paul McCartney]]) – played by Eric Idle
* '''Stig O'Hara''' (styled after [[George Harrison]]) – played by Ricky Fataar
* '''Barry Wom''', né Barrington Womble (styled after [[Ringo Starr]]) – played by John Halsey. The character's truncated name was a play on how Ringo had changed his name from Richard Starkey to Ringo Starr.

Also, in tracing the fictional history of the band, one other member was mentioned:
* '''Leppo, the Fifth Rutle''' (styled after [[Stuart Sutcliffe]], the name referencing [[Zeppo Marx]]) – seen only in a still photograph. The photo showed [[Ollie Halsall]], who played and sang on the soundtrack.

The band that recorded the actual music was slightly different from the band that appeared on camera, as Idle did not take part in the recording process. On the soundtrack release of the music from ''All You Need Is Cash'', the Rutles were officially:
* '''Neil Innes''': guitar, keyboards, vocals. Innes sang the John Lennon-inspired songs.
* '''Ollie Halsall''': guitar, keyboards, vocals. Halsall sang the Paul McCartney-inspired songs.
* '''Ricky Fataar''': guitar, bass, sitar, tabla, vocals. Fataar sang the George Harrison-inspired songs.
* '''John Halsey''': percussion, vocals. Halsey sang the Ringo Starr-inspired songs.
* '''Andy Brown''': bass

While the Rutles are often thought of as a four-piece band, the credits of the original LP release of their first album indicate they were a five-piece. Brown, however, did not appear in any role in ''All You Need Is Cash'', and was not part of any Rutles reunion.

===''Archaeology'' version (1996)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
After an 18-year hiatus, the Rutles (Innes, Halsey and Fataar) reconvened to record the 1996 album ''Archaeology'' (parody of the Beatles ''Anthology''). Halsall had died in 1992, but appears on several tracks that were outtakes from the original 1978 album, and is credited as a band member. (Similarly, the three surviving Beatles had incorporated recordings by John Lennon in the songs "[[Free as a Bird]]" and "[[Real Love (John Lennon song)|Real Love]]".)

On record the band was augmented by keyboardist [[Mickey Simmonds]], who would go on to play with the band live. Also appearing on the record was bassist [[Malcolm Foster]] (ex-[[Pretenders (band)|Pretenders]]), as the Rutles had no bass player. Guitarists [[Doug Boyle]] and Bernie Holland were featured.

===Subsequent touring versions (1997–present)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Innes and Halsey toured as the Rutles in the UK, augmented by other musicians. The touring group performs songs from the Rutles repertoire and from Innes's solo career.

The touring version:
* [[Neil Innes]] – piano, guitar and vocals
* [[John Halsey (musician)|John Halsey]] – drums and vocals
* [[Mark Griffiths]] – bass guitar and vocals
* [[Mickey Simmonds]] – [[Keyboardist|keyboards]] and vocals
* Ken Thornton – [[lead guitar]] and vocals; (nicknamed "Rutling" by Neil Innes)
* J.J. Jones – percussion
* Phil Jackson – keyboards and vocals
* Jay Goodrich – bass guitar and vocals
* [[Elliot Randall]] – guitar (frequent guest in 2015)

===Other bands mentioned in the films===

* Side 1, track 5: The first released Rutles recording. (This version has slightly different lyrics from the 1978 version.)
* Liner notes mis-credit "Kevin" as a Rutle instead of "Barry." (This marks the only appearance of "Kevin" in the Rutles canon, although it could be stated that "Kevin" is more of a parody of [[Pete Best]])
* The original "Rutles" Musicians are: [[Roger Rettig]] and [[Billy Bremner (musician)|Billy Bremner]] on guitars, [[Brian Hodgson]] on bass, [[Neil Innes]] on piano, and [[John Halsey (musician)|John Halsey]] on drums. ''(This group was also known as "Fatso.")''
* Side 1, Track 9: This song is credited as "Ron Lennon," and it is the nucleus of what will later become the Rutles song "[[Good Times Roll (The Rutles)|Good Times Roll]]".
* Album reissued on C.D. in the 1990s with two bonus tracks: "[[Protest Song]]" (Uncensored) &amp; "[[I Must Be In Love]]" (Minus screaming fans.)

===''The Rutles'' (1978)===
{{Main article|The Rutles (album)}}
A soundtrack album entitled ''The Rutles'' containing 14 tongue-in-cheek pastiches of Beatles songs was also released. The CD reissue included the 6 other songs featured on the soundtrack that were not included in the vinyl LP.

The cover art of the album suggested the existence of a number of other Rutles albums including ''Tragical History Tour'' and ''Let It Rot''.

The album contains send-ups of Beatles numbers such as "Ouch!" ("Help!"), "Good Times Roll" ("Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"), "Love Life" ("All You Need is Love"), "Cheese and Onions" ("A Day in the Life"), "Piggy in the Middle" ("I Am the Walrus"), "Doubleback Alley" ("Penny Lane") and "Get Up And Go" (CD reissue only – "Get Back").

===The Rutles ''Archaeology'' (1996)===
{{Main article|The Rutles Archaeology}}
Three of the five musicians who had created the soundtrack for the 1978 film—Innes, Halsey and Fataar—reunited in 1996 and recorded a second album, ''Archaeology'', a send-up of ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' albums. The fourth 'real' Rutle, Ollie Halsall, died in Spain in 1992. Original Rutles bassist Andy Brown did not participate in the reunion.  Eric Idle was invited to participate, but he declined.  Accordingly, photos of the three 'surviving' Rutles parodied those of the then three surviving Beatles in the ''Anthology'' series.

Like the ''Anthology'' project that it lampooned, it featured tracks ostensibly from all periods of the Rutles career, sequenced to reflect the fictional band's chronology. Several of the songs were actually old Innes standards that were dusted off and given the 'Rutles' treatment. The reunion was blessed by George Harrison, who encouraged them to proceed. When approached, he told Innes, "Sure. It's all part of the soup". Innes related that encounter in interviews he gave in 1996, {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} and again in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BBC|first=Radio 4|title=Chain Reaction|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03phrws|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
Following the release of the 1978 the Rutles album, [[ATV Music]], the then-owner of the publishing rights to the Beatles catalogue, sued Innes for copyright infringement. Though Innes hired a musicologist to defend the originality of his songs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The spoof Beatles are back in business |first=Catlin|last=Moran |work=The times |location=London |date=25 October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; he settled with ATV out of court for 50% of the royalties on the 14 songs included on the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.neilinnes.org/articles/RutQ96.htm |author=Paul du Noyer |work=Q Magazine |date=1 December 1996 |title=The Post-Prefab Three |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927141608/http://www.neilinnes.org/articles/RutQ96.htm |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of early 2006, these six songs from the first Rutles CD (which were not on the original LP release, but some of which were included in the television film) are credited solely to Neil Innes: "Baby Let Me Be", "Between Us", "Blue Suede Schubert", "Get Up And Go", "Goose Step Mama", and "It's Looking Good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repertoire.bmi.com/writer.asp?page=1&amp;blnWriter=True&amp;blnPublisher=True&amp;blnArtist=True&amp;fromrow=1&amp;torow=25&amp;affiliation=PRS&amp;cae=58084467&amp;keyID=166392&amp;keyname=INNES%20NEIL%20JAMES&amp;querytype=WriterID |title=Songwriter/Composer: INNES NEIL JAMES |publisher=Repertoire.bmi.com |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other 14 songs from the CD (all songs from the original LP release) have all had John Lennon and Paul McCartney added to the songwriting credits.

'''Travellingua''', also known as the '''Language and Culture Explorers’ Club''', is a project which was supported by the [[European Commission]] under Socrates Lingua 1 (Promotion of Language Learning) action.
The project was implemented from 1 November 2006 to 30 September 2008.

==Outputs==
The official website (''www.travellingua.eu'') has 5 main parts:
# LEARN: A linguistic part with the Phrase book and audio material in 5 languages ([[English language|English]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]);
# EXPLORE: a part which gives basic information about 4 countries, their cultures and languages ([[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]]);
# SHARE: a part where the material (phrase book and [[MP3]] files) can be downloaded for free and learners share their knowledge and experience in language learning and travelling;
# CONSULT: a linguistic part where any learner can ask a general question about language learning or a specific language (Lithuanian, Latvian, Danish or Swedish) and get a professional answer from a linguist. Answers then are posted for the general public;
# CONTINUE STUDIES: a part which gives useful links (with free linguistic resources, [[European Union|EU]]-sponsored linguistic projects are presented among them) for those who decide to continue self-studying Lithuanian, Latvian, Danish or Swedish or to find more information about travelling.

==Results==
As a '''result''' of this project:
* there will be more people having survival-level [[linguistic competence]] of the target languages and being able to use it while travelling or working abroad;
* there will be more people self-studying other European languages (especially from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic group]]);
* less popular European countries and languages will be promoted.

[[Image:br explosion.png|thumb|300px|Chemical mechanism of the bromine explosion. The blue area at the bottom represents the condensed phase (liquid brine or ice surface).]]
 
During springtime in the polar regions, unique photochemistry converts inert halide salt ions (e.g. Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) into reactive [[halogen]] species (e.g. Br atoms and BrO) that episodically deplete [[ozone]] in the [[atmospheric boundary layer]] to near zero levels.  Since their discovery in the late 1980s, research on these ozone depletion events (ODEs) has shown the central role of
[[bromine]] photochemistry.  Due to the [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic]] nature of the reaction mechanism, it has been called bromine explosion. It's still not fully understood how salts are transported from the ocean and oxidized to become reactive halogen species in the air. Other halogens ([[chlorine]] and [[iodine]]) are also activated through mechanisms coupled to bromine chemistry. The main consequence of halogen activation is chemical destruction of ozone, which removes the primary precursor of atmospheric oxidation, and generation of reactive halogen atoms/oxides that become the primary oxidizing species.{{Elucidate|date=November 2013}} The different reactivity of halogens as compared to OH and ozone has broad impacts on [[atmospheric chemistry]], including near complete removal and deposition of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], alteration of oxidation fates for organic gases, and export of bromine into the free [[troposphere]]. Recent changes in the [[climate of the Arctic]] and state of the Arctic sea ice cover are likely to have strong effects on halogen activation and ODEs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8831">'''Unit cohesion in the United States military''' it has been the subject of dispute and political debate since World War II as the United States military has expanded the categories of citizens it accepts as servicemembers. [[Unit cohesion]] is a [[military]] concept, defined by one former [[United States]] [[Chief of staff]] in the early 1980s as "the bonding together of soldiers in such a way as to sustain their will and commitment to each other, the unit, and mission accomplishment, despite combat or mission stress".&lt;ref name=manning&gt;"Morale and Cohesion in Military Psychiatry, Fred Manning, [http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/military_psychiatry/MPch1.pdf p.4] in ''Military Psychiatry: Preparing in Peace for War'', {{ISBN|0160591325}}; Manning cites Meyer, EC, "The unit", ''Defense'', 1982;82(February):1-9
&lt;/ref&gt; The concept lacks a consensus definition among military analysts, [[sociologist]]s, and [[psychologist]]s.&lt;ref name=palmer&gt;Brian Palmer (2010), [http://www.slate.com/id/2276469/ "Pentagon Sees Little Risk in Allowing Gay Men and Women to Serve Openly"] ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', Dec. 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
==Factors affecting unit cohesion==
{{harvnb|Henning|2009|pp=1-16}} has identified some factors in unit cohesion: 
*the units (squad, platoon, or company level) are small enough that key NCOs (E5-E9) can influence others,&lt;ref name=Henning2009/&gt;{{rp|11}} 
*the Unit Manning System emphasizes the stability of units and their families at the brigade level, as structured in Army Force Generation [[ARFORGEN]], rather than the Individual Replacement System in use since before the Vietnam era&lt;ref name=Henning2009/&gt;{{rp|8}} 
*in the WWII and Korean War eras, once a soldier was wounded or separated from his unit, there was little chance of returning to his unit&lt;ref name=Henning2009/&gt;{{rp|8}}  and 
*the Stop Loss pay provision of $500 per month was instituted to encourage personnel to remain with their units during combat deployments.&lt;ref name=Henning2009&gt;{{harvnb|Henning|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6-12}}

==Race==
Prior to US [[Executive Order 9981]], issued on July 26, 1948 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], the [[United States Armed Forces|American military]] was [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]]. Opponents of [[racial integration]] frequently alleged that integrating the armed forces would have detrimental effects on unit cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vnnJYQ4FYasC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Sexual orientation and U.S. military personnel policy: options and assessment]. National Defense Research Institute (U.S.), United States. Dept. of Defense. Page 171, 'Racial Integration, Unit Cohesion, and Military Effectiveness.'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in combat==
Brian Mitchell, in his article "Women Make Poor Soldiers" (excerpted from his 1989 book "''Weak Link: The Feminization of the American Military''"), expressed concern that placing [[Women in the military#Tactical concerns|women in combat]] lowers unit cohesion, either due to [[sexual relationship]]s taking priority over group loyalty, or because men would feel obliged to be more protective of women than other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=According to Mitchell (1991), when women and men work under stressful conditions in close quarters, sexual liaisons may become likely. These liaisons may threaten the stability of military families, disrupt discipline, and distract personnel from the mission.|url=http://www1.appstate.edu/orgs/acjournal/holdings/vol2/Iss1/essays/rooks.html|title=Looking at G.I. Jane through Lenses of Gender |first=Sheri Crowley|last=Rooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell's view was harshly criticized in a [[New York Times]] review, which stated the book was "spoiled by intemperate allegations and a supercilious tone" and lacked sourcing for statements.&lt;ref name=NYTMitchell&gt;{{cite news|last=Halloran|first=Richard|title=FIGHTING WOMEN|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/03/books/fighting-women.html|accessdate=13 May 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=3 September 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraternization==
Air Force Instruction 36-2909 on ''Professional and Unprofessional Relationships'' says:
{{quote|Dating, courtship, and close friendships between men and women are subject to the same policy considerations as are other relationships. Like any personal [*pg 1038] relationship, they become matters of official concern when they adversely affect morale, discipline, unit cohesion, respect for authority, or mission accomplishment. Members must recognize that these relationships can adversely affect morale and discipline, even when the members are not in the same chain of command or unit. The formation of such relationships between superiors and subordinates within the same chain of command or supervision is prohibited because such relationships invariably raise the perception of favoritism or misuse of position and erode morale, discipline and unit cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?14+Duke+J.+Gender+L.+&amp;+Pol'y+1011|last=McSally |title= WOMEN IN COMBAT: IS THE CURRENT POLICY OBSOLETE? |publisher= |year=2007 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Sexual orientation==
{{main|DADT}}

Conservative commentary in the U.S. has taken the view that the service of gays in the military is deleterious to essential components of unit cohesion, such as moral and discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/12/03/wrecking-finest-military-world-price-pay-dont-ask-dont-tell/ | title = Is Wrecking the Finest Military In the World the Price We'll Pay for 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'? | last = North | first = Oliver | authorlink = Oliver North | date = December 3, 2010 | publisher = [[Fox News]] | accessdate = 2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Urvashi Vaid, criticizing the "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" policy in 1995, called unit cohesion a euphemism for "heterosexual male bonding" and wrote that "the essence of male bonding lay in the forcible suppression of undercurrents of homosexual desire."&lt;ref&gt;Urvashi Vaid, ''Virtual Equality: The Mainstreaming of Gay &amp; Lesbian Liberation'' (NY: Doubleday, 1995), 176&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminology and penology |theory}}

'''Victimology''' is the study of [[victimization]], including the psychological effects on victims, relationships between victims and offenders, the interactions between victims and the [[criminal justice]] system—that is, the [[police]] and [[court]]s, and corrections officials—and the connections between victims and other social groups and institutions, such as the media, businesses, and social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Karmen, 2003, ''Crime Victims: An Introduction to Victimology'', Wadsworth Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-534-61632-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Victimology is, however, not restricted to the study of victims of crime alone but may include other forms of human rights violations.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

== Victim of a crime ==
In [[criminology]] and [[criminal law]], a victim of a crime is an identifiable person who has been harmed individually and directly by the [[perpetrator]], rather than by [[society]] as a whole. However, this may not always be the case, as with victims of [[white collar crime]], who may not be clearly identifiable or directly linked to crime against a particular individual. Victims of white collar crime are often denied their status as victims by the social construction of the concept (Croall, 2001). The concept also remains a controversial topic within [[women's studies]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] first recognized the rights of crime victims to make a [[victim impact statement]] during the [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] phase of a [[Criminal law|criminal trial]] in the case of ''[[Payne v. Tennessee]]'' {{ussc|501|808|1991}}.

A [[victim impact panel]], which usually follows the [[victim impact statement]], is a form of community-based or [[restorative justice]] in which the crime victims (or relatives and friends of deceased crime victims) meet with the defendant after conviction to tell the convict about how the criminal activity affected them, in the hope of [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] or [[Deterrence (psychology)|deterrence]].

== Consequences of crimes ==
[[Psychological pain|Emotional distress]] as the result of crime is a recurring theme for all victims of crime.  The most common problems, affecting three quarters of victims, were psychological problems, including: [[fear]], [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], nervousness, [[self-blame]], [[anger]], [[shame]], and difficulty sleeping.&lt;ref name="Sebba"&gt;Sebba, L., (1996). Third Parties, Victims and the Criminal Justice System. Ohio State University Press, Columbus.&lt;/ref&gt; These problems often result in the development of chronic [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD). Post crime distress is also linked to pre-existing emotional problems and sociodemographic variables.  This has been known to become a leading case of the elderly to be more adversely affected.(Ferraro, 1995)

Victims may experience the following psychological reactions:
* Increase in the realization of personal [[vulnerability]].
* The perception of the world as meaningless and incomprehensible.
* The view of themselves in a negative light.&lt;ref name="Sebba" /&gt;

The experience of victimization may result in increasing fear on the part of the victim, and the spread of fear in the community.

=== Environmental theory ===
The environmental theory posits that the location and context of the crime bring the victim of the crime and its perpetrator together.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison on the ''environmental theory'', at [http://www.cameron.edu/~harrison/259,4 Environmental Theory]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in the early 2010s showed that crimes are negatively correlated to trees in urban environments; more trees in an area are congruent with lower victimization rates or violent crime rates.&lt;ref name="More Trees"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/health/more-trees-means-less-crime-baltimore-study-shows.html|title=More Trees (Equals) Less Crime in Baltimore, Study Shows|last=Davies|first=Alex|date=June 19, 2012|accessdate=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Big Trees"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/big-trees-may-make-communities-safer-says-study.html|title=Big Trees May Make Communities Safer, Says Study|last=Messenger|first=Stephen|date=November 1, 2010|accessdate=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Some Trees"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101101171240.htm|title=Some City Trees May Discourage 'Shady' Behavior; Study Explores Relationship Between Urban Trees and Crime|publisher=ScienceDaily|date=November 1, 2010|accessdate=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Portland"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donovan | first1 = G.

[and] we found that the inverse relationship continued in both contexts, but the magnitude was 40% greater for public than for private lands."&lt;ref name="Baltimore" /&gt;

=== Quantification of victim-proneness ===
There have been some studies recently to quantify the real existence of victim-proneness.&lt;ref&gt;David Thissen (The [[University of Kansas]], [[Lawrence, Kansas]]) and Howard Wainer ([[Educational Testing Service]], [[Princeton, New Jersey]]), {{cite journal |title=Toward the Measurement and Prediction of Victim Proneness |url=http://jrc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/20/2/243?ck=nck |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710114559/http://jrc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/20/2/243?ck=nck |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-10 |work=Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=243–261 |year=1983 |doi=10.1177/002242788302000206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the popular belief that more women are repeat victims, and thus more victim-prone than men, actually men in their prime (24- to 34-year-old males) are more likely to be victims of repeated crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Johannes |last=Kingma |title=Repeat Victimization of Victims of Violence: A Retrospective Study From a Hospital Emergency Department for the Period 1971–1995 |journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence |volume=14|issue= 1|pages= 79–90 |year=1999 |url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/14/1/79 |doi=10.1177/088626099014001005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of juvenile offenders, the study results also show that people are more likely to be victimized as a result of a serious offense by someone they know; the most frequent crimes committed by adolescents towards someone they know were sexual assault, common assault, and homicide.  Adolescents victimizing people they did not know generally committed common assault, forcible confinement, and armed or unarmed robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lusignan | first1 = Richard | year = 2007 | title = Risk Assessment and Offender–Victim relationship in Juvenile Offenders | url = | journal = International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology | volume = 51 | issue = 4| pages = 433–443 | doi=10.1177/0306624x06294135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex workers are, anecdotally, thought to have an abnormally high incidence of violent crime committed against them, and such crimes go frequently unresolved, but there are few victimological studies of the matter.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shah|first=Svati|date=2004|title=Prostitution, Sex Work and Violence: Discursive and Political Contexts for Five Texts on Paid Sex, 1987–2001|url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.info/pdfs_all/Prostitution_sex_work_violence2004.pdf|journal=Gender &amp; History|volume=16|pages=794–812|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fundamental attribution error ===
{{Main|Fundamental attribution error}}
{{See also|Dunning–Kruger effect}}
In [[social psychology]], the [[fundamental attribution error]] (also known as ''correspondence bias'' or ''attribution effect'') describes the tendency to over-value [[disposition]]al or personality-based explanations for the observed [[behaviors]] of others while under-valuing situational explanations for those behaviors. The term was coined by [[Lee Ross]]&lt;ref&gt;Ross, L. (1977). The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process. 'In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), ''Advances in experimental social psychology'' (vol. 10, pp. 173–220). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; some years after a now-classic experiment by [[Edward E. Jones]] and Victor Harris (1967).&lt;ref name="JonesHarris67"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jones | first1 = E.E. | last2 = Harris | first2 = V.A. | year = 1967 | title = The attribution of attitudes | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 1–24 | doi=10.1016/0022-1031(67)90034-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental attribution error is most visible when people explain the behavior of others. It does not explain interpretations of one's own behavior—where situational factors are often taken into consideration. This discrepancy is called the [[actor–observer bias]].  As a simple example, if Alice saw Bob trip over a rock and fall, Alice might consider Bob to be clumsy or careless (dispositional). If Alice later tripped over the same rock herself, she would be more likely to blame the placement of the rock (situational).  Victim proneness or [[victim blaming]] can be a form of fundamental attribution error, and more specifically, the ''just-world phenomenon''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The [[Just-world phenomenon]] is the belief that people get what they deserve and deserve what they get, which was first theorized by [[Melvin Lerner]] (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lerner | first1 = M.J. | last2 = Miller | first2 = D.T. | year = 1977 | title = Just-world research and the attribution process: Looking back and ahead | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 1030–1051 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.85.5.1030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attributing failures to dispositional causes rather than situational causes, which are unchangeable and uncontrollable, satisfies our need to believe that the world is fair and we have control over our life. We are motivated to see a just world because this reduces our perceived threats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burger | first1 = J.M. | year = 1981 | title = Motivational biases in the attribution of responsibility for an accident: A meta-analysis of the defensive-attribution hypothesis | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 90 | issue = | pages = 496–12 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.90.3.496}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walster | first1 = E | year = 1966 | title = Assignment of responsibility for an accident | doi = 10.1037/h0022733| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 73–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; gives us a sense of security, helps us find meaning in difficult and unsettling circumstances, and benefits us psychologically.&lt;ref name="correspondence"&gt;Gilbert, D.T., &amp; Malone, P.S.

== Victim facilitation ==

Victim facilitation, another controversial sub-topic, but a more accepted theory than victim proneness, finds its roots in the writings of criminologists such as [[Marvin Wolfgang]]. The choice to use victim facilitation as opposed to "victim proneness" or some other term is that victim facilitation is not blaming the victim, but rather the interactions of the victim that make him/her vulnerable to a crime.

The theory of victim facilitation calls for study of the external elements that make a victim more accessible or vulnerable to an attack.&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, Eric W. (2006). The Male serial murderer. In Serial murderers and their victims (4th ed., pp. 152–159). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Group&lt;/ref&gt; In an article that summarizes the major movements in victimology internationally, Schneider expresses victim facilitation as a model that ultimately describes only the misinterpretation by the offender of victim behavior.&lt;ref name="Schneider, H. J. 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = H. J. | year = 2001 | title = Victimological developments in the world during the past three decades (I): A Study of comparative victimology | url = | journal = International journal of offender therapy and comparative criminology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 449–468 | doi=10.1177/0306624x01454005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based upon the theory of a symbolic interaction and does not alleviate the offender of his/her exclusive responsibility.&lt;ref name="Schneider, H. J. 2001" /&gt;

In Eric Hickey's ''Serial Murderers and their Victims,'' a major analysis of 329 [[serial killers]] in America is conducted. As part of Hickey's analysis, he categorized victims as high, low, or mixed regarding the victim's facilitation of the murder. Categorization was based upon lifestyle risk (example, amount of time spent interacting with strangers), type of employment, and their location at the time of the killing (example, bar, home or place of business).  Hickey found that 13–15% of victims had high facilitation, 60–64% of victims had low facilitation and 23–25% of victims had a combination of high and low facilitation.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2006 pp. 260–262"&gt;Hickey, Eric W. (2006). Victims. In Serial murderers and their victims (4th ed., pp. 260–262). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Group&lt;/ref&gt; Hickey also noted that among serial killer victims after 1975, one in five victims were at greater risk from hitchhiking, working as a prostitute, or involving themselves in situations in which they often came into contact with strangers.&lt;ref name="Hickey, Eric W. 2006 pp. 260–262" /&gt;

There is importance in studying and understanding victim facilitation as well as continuing to research it as a sub-topic of victimization. For instance, a study of victim facilitation increases public awareness, leads to more research on victim-offender relationship, and advances theoretical etiologies of [[violent crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miethe | first1 = Terance D | year = 1985 | title = The Myth or reality of victim involvement in crime: A Review and comment on victim-precipitation research | url = | journal = Sociological focus | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 209–220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the ultimate purposes of this type of knowledge is to inform the public and increase awareness so fewer people become victims. Another goal of studying victim facilitation, as stated by Maurice Godwin, is to aid in investigations. Godwin discusses the theory of victim social networks as a concept in which one looks at the areas of highest risk for victimization from a [[serial killer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Godwin | first1 = Maurice | year = 1998 | title = Victim target networks as solvability factors in serial murder | url = | journal = Social behavioral and personality | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 75–84 | doi=10.2224/sbp.1998.26.1.75}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be connected to victim facilitation because the victim social networks are the locations in which the victim is most vulnerable to the serial killer. Using this process, investigators can create a profile of places where the serial killer and victim both frequent.

== Victimization rate in United States ==
The [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (NCVS) is a tool to measure the existence of actual, rather than reported, crimes—the victimization rate.&lt;ref name="NCVS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict.htm|title=National Crime Victimization Survey Official web site|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223163046/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict.htm|archive-date=2008-02-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Crime Victimization Survey is the [[United States]]' "primary source of information on crime victimization.  Each year, data are obtained from a nationally representative sample of 77,200 households comprising nearly 134,000 persons on the frequency, characteristics and consequences of criminal victimization in the United States.  This survey enables the (government) to estimate the likelihood of victimization by  [[rape]], [[sexual assault]], [[robbery]], [[assault]], [[theft]], household burglary, and motor vehicle theft for the population as a whole as well as for segments of the population such as women, the elderly, members of various racial groups, city dwellers, or other groups."&lt;ref name="NCVS" /&gt; According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] (BJS), the NCVS reveals that, from 1994 to 2005, violent crime rates declined, reaching the lowest levels ever recorded.&lt;ref name="NCVS" /&gt; Property crimes continue to decline.&lt;ref name="NCVS" /&gt;

== Victimization  in Canada ==
In Canada the [[Office of the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime]] (OFOVC) is an independent resource for victims of [[crime]].  It was created in 2007 to ensure the [[federal government]] meets its responsibilities to victims of crime. The ombudsman provides information to victims  about their [[rights]] under [[Canadian federal law]], the services available to them, or to make a complaint about any [[Government agency|federal agency]] or federal [[legislation]] dealing with victims of crime. The ombudsman  also works to ensure that policy makers and other [[criminal justice]] personnel are aware of victims' needs and concerns and to identify important issues and trends that may negatively impact victims. Where appropriate, the Ombudsman may also make recommendations to the [[federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victimsfirst.gc.ca/serv/spt-spt.html|title=Home: Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime|first=Office of the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of|last=Crime|website=www.victimsfirst.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pssg.gov.bc.ca/victimservices/financial/|title=Redirect Page|website=www.pssg.gov.bc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Crime Victims Survey ==
Many countries have such victimization surveys. They give a much better account for the volume crimes but are less accurate for crimes that occur with a (relative) low frequency such as homicide, or victimless 'crimes' such as drug (ab)use. Attempts to use the data from these national surveys for international comparison have failed. Differences in definitions of crime and other methodological differences are too big for proper comparison.

A dedicated survey for international comparison: A group of European criminologists started an international victimization study with the sole purpose to generate international comparative crime and victimization data. The project is now known as the [[International Crime Victims Survey]] (ICVS). After the first round in 1989, the surveys were repeated in 1992, 1996, and 2000 and 2004/2005.

== Society as crime victim ==
One train of thought supposes society itself is the victim of many crimes, especially such [[felony|felonies]] as [[murder]], [[homicide]] and [[manslaughter]].  Many lawyers, judges, and academics have espoused this sentiment. Some [[district attorney]]s feel they represent all of society, while others feel they represent the victims of the crime. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The term ''victimology'', in fact, denotes to the subject, which studies about the harms caused to victim in commission of crime and the relative scope for compensation to the victim as a means of redressal. In criminal jurisprudence, mere punishing of offender is not sufficient to redress the grievance of victim; there is need to compensate the loss or harms suffered by the victim. In Criminal Procedure Code, though provisions have been made in Section 357 to provide compensation to victims, who have suffered loss or harms in consequence to commission of offence. But, what has been provided in Indian Law, as a compensatory measure to victims of crimes, is not enough and this aspect needs to be reviewed by the legislature to frame or enact necessary law, so as to sufficiently compensate to victims of crimes and to provide safeguards to victims of crimes, besides compensating him in monetary terms.

European Union
Victims of gender-based violence and terrorism
The Stockholm programme explicitly mentions gender-based violence victims in Sect. 2.3.4, stating that victims of this kind are particularly vulnerable, and therefore in need of special support and legal protection by the state. Victims of gender-based or domestic violence are entitled to the same protections as those who become victims of crime in an EU member state to which they are not nationals, as these kinds of victims are deemed to be more vulnerable and/or exposed to further harm. Victims of terrorism are also deemed to be in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==== Directive 2012/29/EU ====
The goal specifically for the Directive 2012/29/EU, as stated by the European Union (EU), was to "improve the real, day to-day situation of millions of victims of crime across Europe to the greatest extent possible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/criminal/files/victims/guidance_victims_rights_directive_en.pdf|title=Criminal justice|website=European Commission - European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU's efforts to increase freedom of movement between states has resulted in a growing concern for maintaining the rights of citizens of the EU when visiting a different member state. The EU deemed that the most important way to solve this was to clearly outline the rights of victims, to strengthen and increase victims’ rights as well as increase participation of victims in criminal proceedings.

=== Austria ===

Austria has established protections for Victims of Crime that reside in the EEA Area (EU countries as well as Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland) or those that are Austrian citizens or permanent residents. Victim services include free access to legal advice and representation, counselling and monetary compensation. Monetary compensation however is capped and is only available to victims of serious crimes, which is defined as crimes where the offender serves no less than six months imprisonment. The compensation is funded by fines imposed on convicted offenders and other sources.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/ovc_archives/reports/intdir2005/austria.html|title=Victim Compensation Programs: Austria|website=www.ncjrs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Austria is a signatory to the  Victims of Crime Directive (Directive 2012/29/EU) it has not been wholly compliant, given there is little emphasis on rights of interpretation. Applications, phone calls or emails must be made in either English or German which may hinder victims of crime from accessing services fully or understanding their rights without the help of an embassy or consulate. Another breach of the Directive involves the benefits afforded only to Austrian citizens. Austrian citizens are entitled to compensation if they are a victim of crime, even if they suffer an injury in another country, an additional protection for Austrian citizens only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/comp_crime_victim/comp_crime_victim_aus_en.htm|title=European Commission - European Judicial Network - Compensation to crime victims - Austria|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non EEA nationals have less protection from the state in Austria and must rely instead in contravention of the Directive, on Weissering which is a NFP organisation which provides services for victims of crime. Due to the limited resources (only partly funded by the government, largely reliant on donations) of Weissering, any victim seeking compensation will be means tested and assessed on a case by case basis. Emergency assistance may be available in some cases.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

In terms of engagement, the Austrian Government recently participated in Victims of Crime Awareness Day, promoting the rights of victims in the workplace which is an issue in Austria, in relation to employee/employer violence  but also employee/client violence. This indicates that the Austrian Government is trying to raise awareness about victims of crime, specifically in areas that are presenting a current issue in accordance with the Directive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://victimsupport.eu/news/national-events-to-mark-european-day-for-victims-of-crime/|title=National events to mark European Day for Victims of Crime – Victim Support Europe, the voice of victims in europe|date=16 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Croatia ===

The rights of victims of crimes in Croatia have been improving steadily since Croatia became a candidate for the European Union in 2004. As a result of their wish to become a part of the EU certain prerequisites had to be fulfilled in regards to their criminal justice system and human rights.
Croatia, in order to fulfil said prerequisites, initiated change in their criminal justice system in relation to the rights of victims. The change instigated by the government was in the form of the Department for Support to Witnesses and Other Participants in War Crimes Trials (2005).&lt;ref name="undp.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasia.undp.org/content/dam/rbec/docs/UNDP-CROATIA%20-%20Witness%20and%20Victim.pdf|title=Jasmina Mujkanović, "Development of a Witness and Victim Support System", UNDP Regional Centre for Europe and the CIS, United Nations Development Programme, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a legislative level, the Criminal Procedure Act (2008) increased the rights of victims both within and of out criminal proceedings and recognised victims as a separate entity in court in addition to their role as a witness and injured party.
These rights include the "right to efficient psychological and other expert help and support from the authority, organisation or institution for aiding victims of criminal offences" and the "right to compensation for material and immaterial damages from the state fund".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasia.undp.org/content/dam/rbec/docs/UNDP-CROATIA%20-%20Witness%20and%20Victim.pdf|title=Jasmina Mujkanović, "Development of a Witness and Victim Support System", UNDP Regional Centre for Europe and the CIS, United Nations Development Programme, 2014, p.30, retrieved July 8, 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2008 also saw the enactment of the Crime Victims Compensation Act. This act resulted in the ability for Croatian citizens to receive compensation if they have endured serious personal injury.&lt;ref name="undp.org"/&gt;

Croatia's progressive stance can be exemplified through the recent case of the introduction of laws regarding the compensation to the victims of rape committed during the 1991–1995 Independence War. This move to compensate said victims was a display of the acceptance of the United Nations Security Council's 2008 resolution which stated rape could be considered a war crime.  In line with the Crime Victim Compensation Act, Croatia's parliament, in 2015, adopted laws awarding victims of rape, committed in the Independence War, compensation. This compensation was in the form of a one off payment, coupled with a monthly allowance and access to free therapy, medical and legal services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/croatia-will-pay-rape-victims-from-its-war-for-independence-over-3600-a-month-2015-5,|title=Croatia is planning to pay rape victims from its war for independence over $3,600 a month|first=Zoran|last=Radosavljevic|date=30 May 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15750&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR - Human Rights Committee considers report of Croatia|website=www.ohchr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyprus ===

Under the Compensation of Victims of Violent Crimes Law of 1997, Cyprus outlines that a victim is a person who has suffered serious bodily harm or impairment to one's health, which is attributed directly to a violent crime, or to an individual who has died as a result of such crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/judicialatlascivil/html/pdf/national_law_cv_cyp_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-07-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204305/http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/judicialatlascivil/html/pdf/national_law_cv_cyp_en.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this interpretation, crimes against the person which are not considered to be violent, will not result in the labelling of anyone as a ‘victim’. This fact can be seen as being particularly relevant to crimes often perpetrated against tourists, such as petty theft.

This is crucial in relation to compensation claims, whereby foreign citizens are not afforded the same access to compensation. Nationals of states party to the European Convention on the Compensation of Victim of Violent Crimes are granted access to compensations, as are nationals of all Member States of the Council of Europe who are permanent residents in Cyprus.&lt;ref name="ncjrs.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/ovc_archives/reports/intdir2005/cyprus.html|title=Victim Compensation Programs: Cyprus|website=www.ncjrs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All other foreigners are not granted eligibility in regards to claiming compensation as a victim of any classification of crime committed against them.&lt;ref name="ncjrs.gov" /&gt;

The prosecution of traffickers within Cyprus has been identified as a point of issue by the US Department of State.&lt;ref name="state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2014/226710.htm|title=Cyprus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to statistics gathered, there has been a 55 percent decrease in the conviction of traffickers within Cyprus. Furthermore, perpetrators are often being convicted under statutes which prescribe a much less serious penalty than other anti-trafficking laws. This decrease in convictions reflects a negative impact on victims of trafficking, who may lack faith in a system of criminal justice which does not adequately identify and punish offenders.&lt;ref name="state.gov" /&gt;

=== Denmark ===
When in Denmark victims of crime can access a number of services and support mechanisms to guide them through the criminal justice process.  These services and support mechanisms are implemented through domestic legislation and not international law.&lt;ref name="EU Justicia :: Welcome"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eujusticia.net/images/uploads/pdf/Victims_Directive_36_page|title=EU Justicia :: Welcome|website=eujusticia.net|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversial issue surrounding Danish Victim law is the decision not to sign any European Union directive on victims’ rights. One of the most influential articles of EU legislation for victims constitutes Directive 2012/29/EU, which set minimum standards for victims’ rights. However, as Denmark is not a signatory they are not obligated to implement the directive.&lt;ref name="EU Justicia :: Welcome" /&gt;

Despite this decision, Denmark still has a relatively high standard for Victims rights within domestic legislation.The Victims Compensation Law of 2005 allows Danish and foreign citizens as well as Danish citizens living outside of Denmark access to compensation for victims of crime with serious injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/judicialatlascivil/html/pdf/manual_cv_den_en.pdf|title=Compensation to Crime Victims – Denmark|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817010344/http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/judicialatlascivil/html/pdf/manual_cv_den_en.pdf|archive-date=2016-08-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish police are required by law to accept any criminal report irrespective of the language used. Compensation for victims of crime is extensive within Denmark. Compensation can be given to those who suffered serious injuries and dependents of homicide victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/ovc_archives/reports/intdir2005/denmark.html|title=Victim Compensation Programs: Denmark|website=www.ncjrs.gov|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For medical expenses and loss of income there is no limit, whilst other forms of compensation (compensable costs) are capped at 1000 Danish Kroner, being decided by a compensation board. A time period of two years applies for all applications for compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/standardsetting/victims/6041-6-ID3996-Victims%20-%20Support%20and%20assistance.pdf|title=Victims – Support and Assistance|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other support services for victims of crime within Denmark include free legal aid for violent crime upon application and automatic free legal aid for victims of sexual assault. For all other crimes the court will decide on free legal services on the grounds of economic situation and necessity. In addition, every victim whom comes before the system has the right to an interpreter as well as free translation of legal documents from the victim's primary language of understanding. In addition, victim support services are accessible to all residents even in circumstances where no crime has been reported, nor is there any criminal proceeding underway. This allows victims to access services and undergo rehabilitation, even in the instance where a choice is made to not report the crime. In the instance of mediation between offender and the victim, whereby the offender expresses remorse and the victim accepts the apology and reconciles, the judge and therefore the court may formally acknowledge the situation, still applying the sentence, however with a lighter punishment. This empowerment of the victim is often more necessary to provide closure than the strict punishment of the offender.&lt;ref name="European e-Justice Portal"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_rights_of_victims_of_crime_in_criminal_proceedings-171-DK-maximizeMS-en.do?clang=en&amp;idSubpage=1&amp;member=1#n11|title=European e-Justice Portal|website=e-justice.europa.eu|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon investigation of the alleged crime, a regional public prosecution or law enforcement officials will decide how to proceed with the case. If there is a decision not to prosecute on behalf of the police, and therefore not proceed to a court trial (closure of the case), the victim can appeal the decision before a regional public prosecutor. If the regional public prosecutor has initially decided to close the investigation, then the next avenue is a submission of appeal is to be directed towards the Director of public prosecutions.&lt;ref name="European e-Justice Portal" /&gt;

=== Estonia ===

The Estonian citizenship report a high trust in the incorruptibility of their judicial system (74%), legislators (67%) and police (83%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013 (Estonia)|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013/country/?country=estonia|website=Transparency International|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, however, only 43% of victims of serious crimes said they reported it to the police, and only 17% said they were satisfied with the treatment of their complaint to police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Dijik|first1=Jan|last2=Groenhuijsen|first2=Marc|editor1-last=Walklate|editor1-first=Sandra|title=Handbook of Victims and Victimology|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-1-84392-257-5|page=544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NGO 'Estonian Crime Victim Support Society' has been in operation for over 20 years, and released a Victim Support Handbook in 2002 that led a debate about legislation dealing with victim support issues that ultimately cumulated in the Victim Support Act in 2003.&lt;ref name="University of Applied Sciences"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lummer|first1=Ricarda|last2=Hagemann|first2=Otmar|last3=Nahrwold|first3=Mario|title=Improving Knowledge and Practice of Restorative Justice|url=http://www.thamesvalleypartnership.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/RJ-Final-Report-EU-Project.pdf|publisher=University of Applied Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act was the beginning of a paradigmatic shift in Estonian criminal justice from a strongly retributive mindset to one of restorative justice, and showed a need and interest in caring for victims, as well as much more attention and real practical and material help for victims of crime.&lt;ref name="University of Applied Sciences" /&gt;

However, the NGO lacks state support and funding, and so is unable to offer high quality victim support throughout Estonia. State victim support only deals with certain types of offences with a fixed agenda and is far more regulated, making the process much more official, and leading to victims uncomfortable participating.&lt;ref name="University of Applied Sciences" /&gt;

Victims of crime of violence committed within the Republic of Estonia are entitled to state compensation pursuant to the Victim Support Act.&lt;ref name="riigiteataja.ee"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Republic of Estonia: Social Insurance Board|title=State compensation of victims of crime|url=https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/521122013001/consolide|website=Republic of Estonia: Social Insurance Board|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Victim Support Act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Victim Support Act|url=https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/521122013001/consolide|website=Riigi Teataja|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serious damage to one's health, a health disorder lasting at least 6 months or death as a result of a crime of violence may entitle a victim and/or their dependents compensation.&lt;ref name="riigiteataja.ee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Victim Support Act" /&gt; A single victim and all his dependents are entitled to compensation equaling 80% of material damage as a result of the crime, but no more than a total 9590 euros, on the basis of: damage arising from work incapacity; medical treatment expenses; damage due to victim death; damage caused to appliances substituting for bodily functions (e.g. spectacles, dentures, contact lenses) and to clothes; funeral expenses of victim.&lt;ref name="riigiteataja.ee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Victim Support Act" /&gt;

=== Bulgaria ===
Bulgaria's attempts to protect and support the rights of victims of crime are generally considered superficial.  Victims are entitled to participate in criminal trials as witnesses, private accusers or complainants, with assistance from legal counsel.  Additionally, legislation provides for protection of vulnerable witnesses (e.g. children, victims of sexual offences) during witness examination way police handled their matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==== Issues for Rape Victims ====
Bulgaria's rape laws have been controversial, with a number of applications made to the European Court of Justice for breaches of the Convention on Human Rights.  In M.C. v Bulgaria, the ECJ held that the decision not to prosecute the rape of a 14-year-old rape victim breached her rights provided under Articles 3 and 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation enshrined a practice where rapes would only be prosecuted where there was evidence of physical force and active resistance.  The court held that rape laws must apply to all forms of non-consensual sexual acts.
More recently, a number of breaches of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) were highlighted in a Committee report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report was critical of Bulgaria's failure to provide for adequate compensation for victims of sexual offences as well as the reliance on gender stereotypes when drafting legislation.

==== Issues with Human Trafficking Laws ====

A recent Council of Europe on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings found that no adult victims of human trafficking received any form of assistance from the Bulgarian Government.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key reason for this seems to stem from peculiarities and uncertainty surrounding the legislative framework on human trafficking. First, it has two separate definitions: one for criminalisation of conduct and one for identification of victims.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt;  The latter is more restrictive, so a person may be considered a victim for the purposes of a criminal trial yet fall outside the definition of ‘victim’ where support services and compensation are concerned.  Secondly, Bulgaria's legislation operates solely from the perspective of Bulgaria being a country of ‘origin’ – i.e. that trafficking involves the relocation of Bulgarian nationals to other countries.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt;  As a consequence, victims who are within Bulgaria but are non-EU nationals may fall through cracks in the legislation.

=== France ===
'''Introduction:'''

France is a signatory to the EU's directive on Victims’ rights and had until November 2015 to transpose it. As of February 2016, it had still failed to notify the EU what, if any, policies it had implemented to fulfill this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://victimsupport.eu/news/the-eu-victims-directive-on-eu-day-for-victims-of-crime-2016-infringement-cases-opened-against-16-member-states/|title=Victim Support Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal proceedings in France take the form of an investigation and a trial. Investigations are undertaken by French detective police under the authority of the prosecutor (police investigation) or the investigating magistrate (judicial investigation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_rights_of_victims_of_crime_in_criminal_proceedings-171-fr-en.do?member=1|title=European Justice (2012): Rights of Victims in Criminal Proceedings|last=|first=|date=December 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the investigation goes to trial, victims have the right to be involved in the trial and have access to legal counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://e-justice.europa.eu/contentMaximisation.do?clang=en&amp;idTaxonomy=171&amp;idCountry=FR&amp;idSubpage=2&amp;member=1&amp;action=maximizeMS&amp;vmac=EjFQo72az24McyD895MPv1dXhu53NMU7uYQSZOp00j09rJNRaWI9sUnmTPuC_eDD1Nu0_7BEN_zEYe0s2vCM-AAABZUAAACU|title=European Justice (2012): My Rights During the Trial|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Compensation:'''

Under France's Framework Justice Act (2002), police are obligated to inform victims of their right to apply for compensation and seek a civil remedy. Police can register compensation claims on behalf of victims so there is no need to go to court.A state fund for compensation for victims of violent crimes exists called The State Fund for the Victims of Crime. This is partly funded by Criminal Justice bodies who recoup funds from perpetrators (The Reform Act 1990).

'''Victim Resources''':

There a number of organisations within France dedicated to providing justice and support for victims of crime in France. The European Justice e-porta fact sheet, offered in over 23 languages, outlines a number of different ones, including the National Victim Support and Mediation Institute (INAVEM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_rights_of_victims_of_crime_in_criminal_proceedings-171-FR-maximizeMS-en.do?clang=en&amp;idSubpage=4&amp;member=1|title=European Justice (2012): Rights of Victims in Criminal Proceedings|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is partially funded and certified by the department of Justice, and aims to drive, coordinate, and promote victim support missions. The organisation's 08VICTIMS (08 84284637) helpline is always available. It directs victims towards their nearest INAVEM support office who can get the victim assistance from the relevant victim organisation. It also promotes awareness of victims rights, as well as representing victims' aid associations at national, European and international level. The INAVEM has been pushing the French Government to implement the directive, providing recommendations based on their assessment of victims’ needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://victimsupport.eu/activeapp/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5_12_14_Presentation-French-MinistryJustice1.pdf|title=Victims' Support Europe (2015): French INAVEM Presentation|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human Trafficking:'''

In 2012, France was found to have violated Article 4 of the European Convention of Human Rights due to its failure to provide an adequate framework to protect the rights of human trafficking victims. As of 2013, however, the Government of France was in full compliance with the required minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. Despite this, the protection was still largely focused on victims of sex trafficking and not victims of labour trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/210739.pdf|title=2013 Trafficking in Persons report|last=|first=|date=June 1, 2013|website=U.S Department of State|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===

==== Introduction to Victims’ Rights in Germany ====
Justice proceedings in Germany take place under the Inquisitorial System of Justice, meaning that the judge has an active role within the investigation and trial process. In contrast to the Adversarial System of trial, it is possible to have more than two opposing parties in a criminal trial, as there is not such a large requirement of a balance between the prosecution and the rights of the defendant. Therefore, the German Code of Criminal Procedure 1987 (herein ‘Criminal Code’) gives victims a number of rights, including the right to participate in the trial; the right to appeal after the conclusion of the trial; and the right to seek compensation for their loss.

==== Links with the European Union ====
As a founding member of the European Union, Germany is required to sign and implement to EU's directive on Victims’ Rights into their national laws by 16 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/criminal/victims/index_en.htm|title=Criminal justice|website=European Commission - European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU requires that victims are recognised and treated with respect and dignity; protected from further victimisation/intimidation from the offender or within the criminal justice proceedings; receive appropriate support and have access to compensation. Germany's Criminal Code has not been amended since April 2014, therefore nothing has been further implicated. However it is clear that Germany's Criminal Code already satisfies the EU requirements through their extensive rights and protections of the victim, entrenched within their Criminal Code.

==== Legal representative for victims in the trial ====
Unlike many other jurisdictions, Part Five of the Criminal Code allows victims of crime to participate in the criminal proceedings against the accused. For victims of personal offences such as defamation; bodily injury; and property damage,&lt;ref&gt;For full list, see s 374 German Code of Criminal Procedure&lt;/ref&gt; victims are automatically entitled to engage a Private Accessory Prosecutor (‘PAP’) who will represent their interests at trial. For victims of crime not mentioned in s 374 of the Criminal Code, permission can be sought from the Public Prosecution Office (‘PPO’).

The Criminal Code&lt;ref&gt;German Code of Criminal Procedure 1987, s 385&lt;/ref&gt; rules that the status of the PAP is that of the PPO in the preferred public charge, meaning they are able to participate to the same extent and be heard in the proceedings on the private charges. Furthermore, the PAP is entitled to a period of one week between summons and the main hearing and holds the right to inspect the files through an attorney.

Furthermore, should victim's not be eligible for PAP or choose not to do so, they have the right to engage a legal representative as a witness to uphold their interests when, for example, they are being questions as a witness at the main trial.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, K 2014, ‘Legal Representatives for Sexual Assault Victims – Possibilities for Law Reform?’, Current Issues in Criminal Justice, Vol 25, No 3, p 828.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Victims' opportunity to appeal the judgment ====
PAP in principle, are entitled to appeal a judgement on grounds of fact and law only. However, an appeal by a PAP will be rejected should it be solely on account of leniency of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_rights_of_victims_of_crime_in_criminal_proceedings-171-DE-maximizeMS-en.do?clang=en&amp;idSubpage=3&amp;member=1|title=European e-Justice Portal|website=e-justice.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part three in the Criminal Code addresses appellate remedies and states that an appeal on fact and law needs to be filed with the court of first instance either orally to be recorded by the registry or in writing within one week after pronouncement of the judgment.&lt;ref&gt;German Code of Criminal Procedure 1987, Chapter 3, s 314&lt;/ref&gt;

A PAP may withdraw at any stage throughout the proceedings but needs to consented by the defendant after the commencement of their examination of the main hearing. The PAP would be deemed to have withdrawn charges, if an appeal on the fact and law was filed by them, this would immediately be dismissed.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;German Code of Criminal Procedure 1987, s 391&lt;/ref&gt; Once the PAP withdraws, it may not be brought back a second time.&lt;ref&gt;German Code of Criminal Procedure 1987, s 392&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is important to note that the PAP may demand restoration of the ‘status quo ante’ (previously existing state of affairs) within one week after the default subject to the conditions specified in sections 44 and 45.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

==== Victims' compensation ====
Germany has a compensation program for victims of violent or personal crimes. A police report needs to be filed within a year in order to be eligible for compensation. According to the Crimes Victims Compensation Act (1985), all European Union citizens from foreign member states are also eligible for financial compensation. This covers special compensatory damages (out of pocket expenses), such as loss of earnings and medical expenses. However, it does not cover general damages which are non-monetary for example, mental anguish, pain and suffering.

=== Greece ===

In Greece, you are considered a victim if you have suffered damage (either personal injury or harm to/loss of property) as a result of an incident that constitutes a crime under national law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_rights_of_victims_of_crime_in_criminal_proceedings-171-el-en.do?member=1|title=European e-Justice Portal – Victims of crime|website=e-justice.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The motivation behind the Directive 2012/29/EU, effectively setting a minimum standard for victims rights, is illustrated by the case of Robbie Hughes in 2008, a victim of a serious attack in Greece who was left with no support or advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eesc.europa.eu/?i=portal.en.press-releases.37532|title=Victims' Rights in the EU: Now a reality|date=19 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU Member States (except Denmark) were required to implement the Directive into national law by 16 November 2015. However, Greece is one of the 16 countries facing infringement proceedings for the non-communication of the Directive.&lt;ref name="victimsupport.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://victimsupport.eu/news/the-eu-victims-directive-on-eu-day-for-victims-of-crime-2016-infringement-cases-opened-against-16-member-states/|title=The EU Victims' Directive on EU Day for Victims of Crime 2016: Infringement cases opened against 16 Member States – Victim Support Europe|date=22 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece, victims of crime enjoy rights before, during and after the trial process. In certain circumstances, such cases where the victim is a minor or has suffered sexual abuse, victims are afforded additional rights, support and protection. There is no discrimination by support services against foreigners.&lt;ref name="fra.europa.eu"&gt;http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/country-study-victim-support-services-el.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign victims are entitled to an interpreter when testifying to the police.&lt;ref name="fra.europa.eu" /&gt;

However, Greece has been criticised for its lack of upholding minority victims rights and its failure in remedying human rights in cases of hate crime.&lt;ref name="hrw.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/02/19/greece-address-longstanding-rights-issues|title=Greece: Address Longstanding Rights Issues|date=19 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to file a complaint, the current law requires the payment of a fee, dissuading victims of hate crime from reporting offences.&lt;ref name="hrw.org1" /&gt; This deficiency is exacerbated by the lack of protection for undocumented migrants experiencing hate crime.&lt;ref name="hrw.org1" /&gt; Demonstrating the limited victim status of migrants and minority groups members is the inadequacy of support where such groups are victims of police abuse. Greece has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights 11 times for the misuse of weapons by police and the subsequent absence of effective investigations. Migrants or members of minority groups were victims in ten of these incidents.&lt;ref name="hrw.org1" /&gt;

'''Compensation for victims of intentional crimes of violence in Greece'''
For victims of domestic violence and other intentional crimes such as child abuse, if the offender lacks the means to provide compensation for their crime(s), or if the offender remains anonymous, the state of Greece, under the Compensation Directive 2004/80/EC is obliged to provide compensation to victims of intentional crimes of violence.&lt;ref name="loc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/greece-draft-law-on-compensation-of-victims-of-intentional-violence/|title=Greece: Draft Law on Compensation of Victims of Intentional Violence – Global Legal Monitor|date=3 December 2009|website=www.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compensation provided by the perpetrator or the state of Greece must cover financial losses associated with physical damage resulting from the violent crime, this includes medical fees, loss of income and funeral costs. However, psychological damage and trauma resulting from the crime are not compensated.&lt;ref name="loc.gov" /&gt; Victims of crime in Greece have five days to report the crime; if the crime is not reported in this timeframe, victims are not eligible for compensation.&lt;ref name="loc.gov" /&gt; An [http://www.ministryofjustice.gr/site/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=PqM22gvCCCg%3d&amp;tabid=163 application form] is required for processing compensation claims, and this is to be completed in Greek.

'''Support services available to victims of crimes in Greece'''
There are a number of services available to victims of crime in Greece. These include:

=== Hungary ===

In Hungary there is a general lack of understanding in how to combat and prevent domestic violence. This often stems from cultural ideas about women in Hungarian society and the idea that some amount of violence is inevitable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Until new legislation was introduced in 2013, Domestic Violence was not categorized as a separate offence from other assaults.  This means that victims of domestic violence in Hungary were accosted the same rights as victims from a range of circumstances.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2013/11/06/unless-blood-flows/lack-protection-domestic-violence-hungary|title=Unless Blood Flows|date=6 November 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Human Rights Watch, "authorities [often] told victims that extreme physical violence…should be considered light, and not sufficiently serious to trigger an investigation’’.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/11/11/surviving-love-domestic-violence-hungary|title=Surviving Love: Domestic Violence in Hungary|date=11 November 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in other cases when women reported the abuse to the police, the alleged offenders were taken into custody but, quite often released instantaneously without being taken to court. This highlights a lack of support from the police and the courts in combating domestic violence.&lt;ref name="hrw.org" /&gt; In many instances, it is the responsibility of the victim, not the prosecution or the police to start a course of legal action which hinders effective remedies of domestic violence. In the ECtHR case Kalucza vs. Hungary 2012, the applicant complained that the Hungarian authorities had failed to protect her abuse from her husband in her home. The ECtHR concluded that Article 8 (right to respect for private life and family life) had been abused by Hungarian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;http://echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Domestic_Violence_ENG.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  After the changes in 2013 however, harsher penalties were introduced for perpetrators of domestic violence.  At this time as well, the onus was placed upon the prosecution and not the victim to pursue legal action.&lt;ref name="hrw.org" /&gt; This increased the rights of the victims within Hungary in relation to domestic abuse.  In spite of these changes however, an instance of domestic violence will only be considered if there have been two separate instances of abuse.&lt;ref name="hrw.org" /&gt; Furthermore, the amendments only protected partners who were living together and neglected to protect those who were not living in the same residence. The new legislation is also lacking in a plan of a National level that could effectively combat domestic violence as an issue.&lt;ref name="hrw.org" /&gt; Procedures have been put in place to help police respond to instances of domestic violence however, no such guidelines exist for judges, prosecutors, social workers and healthcare workers. Ultimately the provisions are not strong enough to deal with the issue sufficiently they are also not accepted and applied. Hungary also did not sign up to the Istanbul Convention, a practical convention aimed at combating domestic violence. It concluded that countries should "establish hotlines, shelters, medical and foreign services, counselling and legal aid" in order to protect abused women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

=== Ireland ===

Following the introduction of the directive on victims rights by the EU in 2012.(reference the directive) It is particularly relevant to examine the avenues available to victims in terms of compensation and legal aid, and avenues for retribution.

==== Compensation ====
There are a number of ways to claim compensation as a victim of crime, be it through a court order dictating that an offender must pay compensation to you. If you are injured as a result of a crime, you can seek to claim compensation under the Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted. This would be funded through the Department of Justice and Equality and administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.
To seek compensation for an injury inflicted in another EU state you need to contact the compensation tribunal to gain information around how to claim compensation from the member state in question.
There is no time limit to making a claim if the injury inflicted resulted in the death of a victim. if this did not occur, claims must be made within 3 months.

==== Eligibility for compensation ====
Compensation will be provided to victims, or in the event of a fatality, the immediate family of the victim.
The scheme of compensation is available to you if you were injured as a result of violent crime or if you were injured in assisting another victim of crime or whilst attempting to save a life.
You do not need legal representation to apply for compensation and then tribunal is not obliged to cover any legal costs.
No compensation will be given to you in the event you were living with the perpetrator at the time of the attack, meaning this is not available to victims of domestic violence.  In addition, the compensation scheme does not exist to provide retribution for pain and suffering, but instead to cover out of pocket expenses and medical bills.
Compensation is means tested and may vary depending on welfare payments, salary, and sick leave. The tribunal also considers your character and way of life when deciding compensation level. If you are found to have provoked the injury, compensation is unlikely to be provided.

=== Italy ===
Victims rights are outlined by the Code of Penal Procedure which details that during the prosecution and sentencing stages, victims have the right to be informed of judicial proceeding developments and can produce evidence at any stage of the trial. Victims also have the right to oppose the Judge for the Preliminary Investigation's request for dismissal of the case and to protect their rights by having a defending counsel if necessary.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=169641|title=NCJRS Abstract – National Criminal Justice Reference Service|website=www.ncjrs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 90 of the Code of Penal Procedure states that victims are allowed to present written memories and statements at any stage of the judicial process that indicate evidence. Furthermore, section 3 of Article 90 states that if a victim has died as a result of the crime then the power of rights as states by law are able to be exercised by close relatives of the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studiocataldi.it/codiceprocedurapenale/personaoffesa.asp|title=Codice di procedura penale – La Persona Offesa|website=www.studiocataldi.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims are able to access assistance agencies, which have the primary objective of providing adequate compensation. The amount and source of compensation is determined by the nature and severity of the crime. For instance, victims of organized crime and terrorism are entitled to up to 100,000 US dollars from the State while victims that have experienced property or medical damage will be compensated by their offenders. Additionally, a victim with special needs may be granted of free legal aid and will be compensated by both private donations and a proportion of the pay received by convicted working prisoners from the Department of Prisons. The victims’ assistance agencies also provide the option to accompany the victim at trial with their consent.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

==== Child Victims ====
One of the most vulnerable victim groups in Italy is children under the age of 16. Some of the most prevalent challenges faced by children in Italy include child labor, forced participation in organized crime and also becoming refugees after fleeing their own nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanium.org/en/italy/|title=Children of Italy – Humanium • We make children's rights happen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although young victims have rights explicitly stated in the Italian Penal Code, the Italian criminal justice system lacks ongoing supportive resources to protect the rights of children.

The European Commission has outlined the rights of the victims and states that all victims will be individually assessed to identify vulnerability. Young victims are always presumed vulnerable and particular attention is paid to categories such as victims of terrorism, organized crime, human trafficking, gender-based violence, victims with disabilities, sexual violence and exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/criminal/victims/rights/index_en.htm|title=Rights of the victim – European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and article 609 decies of the Italian Penal Code, a child victim of sexual exploitation is to be assisted throughout the entire proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/Justice_in_matters...pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 498 of the Italian Code of Penal Procedure states that the investigatory examination of a child in a court of law must be undertaken by the President of questions and is also assisted by a family member or child psychologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studiocataldi.it/codiceprocedurapenale/dibattimento.asp|title=Codice di procedura penale – Dibattimento|website=www.studiocataldi.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malta ===
Following a report commissioned by former justice minister Chris Said lamenting the poor state in which victims were treated, Malta introduced the Victims of Crime Act (2015) on the 2nd of April of that year.&lt;ref name="timesofmalta.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150420/local/new-law-gives-crime-victims-legal-aid-right.564676|title=New law gives crime victims legal aid right|first=Allied Newspapers|last=Ltd|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report emphasised the need to increase the amount of resources for the legal aid office and said that victims should be able to receive benefits from the service.&lt;ref name="timesofmalta.com" /&gt; The new Act provides free legal aid to victims of crime, where this was only open to the accused prior to its assent.&lt;ref name="timesofmalta.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="justiceservices.gov.mt"&gt;http://justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&amp;itemid=26766&amp;l=1&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr Roberta Lepre, director of Victim Support Malta, there are three primary focuses in the legislation: information, support, and protection.&lt;ref name="timesofmalta.com" /&gt; In terms of information, victims now have the right to easily access to clear information about the relevant procedures, what support services are available, how to access legal aid services, how to access compensation, and whether they are entitled to translation services.&lt;ref name="justiceservices.gov.mt" /&gt; Victims also now have the right to receive acknowledgement of a complaint, outlining the basic elements of the crime concerned as well as ongoing information about his or her case.&lt;ref name="justiceservices.gov.mt" /&gt; Further, if police do not arraign suspect, the victim has right to be informed of the decision in writing.&lt;ref name="justiceservices.gov.mt" /&gt;

When it comes to support, victims now have the right to free use of support services following a needs and risk assessment.&lt;ref name="justiceservices.gov.mt" /&gt; Support services also include information on how to receive information on prevention of further risk of victimisation, and access to counselling for emotional or psychological damage.&lt;ref name="justiceservices.gov.mt" /&gt; Competent authorities are also obliged to inform victims of ways in which they can be protected, such as seeking a protection order.&lt;ref name="justiceservices.gov.mt" /&gt;

The legislation is primarily aimed at allowing victims a greater voice, and potentially working towards reconciliation between victim and offender by decreasing the hardship of the former.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150324/local/bill-increasing-rights-of-victims-of-crime.561249|title=Bill increasing rights of victims of crime|first=Allied Newspapers|last=Ltd|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purposes of the Act, a victim is one who has suffered "physical, mental or emotional harm or economic loss which was directly caused by a criminal offence".&lt;ref name="justiceservices.gov.mt" /&gt; This also applies to family members of those who have died as a direct result of a crime.&lt;ref name="justiceservices.gov.mt" /&gt; Such broad provisions allow for the benefits to be accessed by many people. It is too early to say, however, whether the new legislation has been implemented effectively.

=== Lithuania ===
Lithuania has several national mechanisms relating to the rights and support for victims of crime. The Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Police Department of the Ministry of the Interior each provide legal aid and set up measures of protection for victims of crime.&lt;ref name="e-justice.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_rights_of_victims_of_crime_in_criminal_proceedings-171-LT-maximizeMS-en.do?clang=en&amp;idSubpage=4&amp;member=1|title=European e-Justice Portal|website=e-justice.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1996, the Parliament of Lithuania has adopted a law providing for the protection of parties in relation to criminal offences, which can be extended towards victims of crime and their families against further victimization. As per methods of victim compensation, additional provisions such as Article 107 allows for voluntary compensation for victims of crime. If this has not occurred, Article 110 stipulates that the victim can charge the offender with a civil suit, be it of a direct or indirect consequence. Further, if the offender is not able to provide compensation for the victim, Article 118 contends that the state will provide compensation in advance.&lt;ref name="books.google.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NF04lGWdaEAC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;lpg=PA226&amp;dq=victims+of+crime+lithuania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4XYo8viy31&amp;sig=tUxiNo2vUIip89lvqMvcSOI7mvM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3BKdVevuEKOWygOznbK4Cw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=victims+of+crime+lithuania&amp;f=false|title=Victims: Support and Assistance|first=Council of|last=Europe|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Council of Europe|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these rights provided to victims of crime, there are many NGO's operating within Lithuania to provide facilities and support for victims. These include the 'Crime Victim Care Association of Lithuania'.&lt;ref name="books.google.it" /&gt; Cartias Lithuania, Missing Person's Support Centre, Klaipeda Social and Psychological Support Centre, Child House and the International Organization for Migration – Vilinius Office.&lt;ref name="e-justice.europa.eu" /&gt;

Studies have been conducted into the physical and psychological state and needs of victims post criminalization, especially that of victims of trafficking. These studies greatly assist NGO's understanding and assisting victims of crime providing greater relief during the criminal trial process, incarceration system and return to everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nordicbaltic-assistwomen.net/IMG/pdf/Lithuanian_Model_WT_Final_May_2008-2.pdf|title=The Model of assistance for woman victims of human trafficking in Lithuania|publisher=|access-date=2015-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224947/http://nordicbaltic-assistwomen.net/IMG/pdf/Lithuanian_Model_WT_Final_May_2008-2.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latvia ===
Latvia does not have a comprehensive victim support system, nor is there a single policy that suggests that the development of such a system would be seen as a priority in the near future.&lt;ref name="repozytorium.amu.edu.pl"&gt;[https://repozytorium.amu.edu.pl/jspui/bitstream/10593/12051/1/Projekt_4.pdf IMPROVING PROTECTION OF VICTIMS’ RIGHTS IN LATVIA – ACCESS TO LEGAL AID AND MEDIATION AS A TOLL TO SETTLE THE CONFLICT]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the criminal procedure law of Latvia includes a specific chapter dedicated to victims.&lt;ref name="repozytorium.amu.edu.pl" /&gt; This chapter outlines the procedural rights and obligations of victims.

In Latvia, in order to be recognized as a victim under the criminal procedure law four steps must be undertaken. Firstly, a criminal procedure must be initiated.&lt;ref name="repozytorium.amu.edu.pl" /&gt; Secondly, there must be information that suggests as the result of the offence the person was harmed.&lt;ref name="repozytorium.amu.edu.pl" /&gt; Thirdly, the person who experienced the harm must agree to become a victim within the criminal proceedings.&lt;ref name="repozytorium.amu.edu.pl" /&gt; Fourthly and finally, the person in charge of the criminal proceedings must recognise that the person is a victim. Once these four steps take place, and the person is established as a victim, the victim gains victim rights.&lt;ref name="repozytorium.amu.edu.pl" /&gt;

Victims of crime in Latvia have access to legal aid. Legal aid is often unaffordable to victims however, as although expenses for legal assistance be reimbursed from the offender, the victim has to pay the costs upfront at the time.

State compensation, for moral injury, physical suffering or financial loss, is available to victims of certain types of crimes. This includes in cases of intentional criminal offences, if the offence resulted in death, if the offence resulted in severe bodily injuries or if the perpetrator of the offence was not identified and thus has not been held criminally liable. The maximum amount of compensation is give minimal monthly wages and the amount awarded depends on the severity of the crime. In the case of the crime causing the victim's death, 100% of compensation shall be awarded.

==== Human Trafficking ====
Latvia is a Tier 2 source and destination country persons trafficked for sexual exploitation and forced labour.&lt;ref name="USSD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/105388.htm#|title=Country Narratives -- Countries H through R|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To safeguard the rights of victims of trafficking, the government of Latvia has increased the accessibility of government funded protections, such as offering victims of trafficking temporary residency in exchange for participating in the judicial process against human traffickers.&lt;ref name="USSD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://repozytorium.amu.edu.pl/jspui/bitstream/10593/12051/1/Projekt_4.pdf|title=Sile, S., &amp; Ziedina, D., (2015). "Improving Protection of Victims' Rights in Latvia – Access to Legal Aid and Mediation as a Toll to Settle the Conflict"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of investigation, qualifying victims are offered government aid, which is 70% of the maximum amount of state compensation.&lt;ref name="Likumi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=136683|title=Par valsts kompensāciju cietušajiem|website=LIKUMI.LV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victims who do not meet the qualifying criteria are referred to non-governmental organisations for aid.&lt;ref name="USSD" /&gt; Furthermore, victims who may have directly or indirectly participated in unlawful activity as a result of their trafficking can avoid prosecution.&lt;ref name="USSD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Likumi" /&gt;
Intersecting with social services and assistance laws, the Latvian government also ensures the social rehabilitation of the victims of human trafficking.&lt;ref name="providus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://providus.lv/upload_file/Projekti/Kriminalitesibas/Victim%20support/ANG_105_finish_doc.pdf|title=Zavackis, A., Judins, A., Dzenovska, I., Kronberga, I., &amp; Sile, S.

=== Luxembourg ===

Luxembourg has a well-developed program of victim support services through the state run Victim Support Service (part of the Ministry of Justice). It is one of only five Member States where the Ministry of Justice is solely responsible for the distribution of these services.&lt;ref name="europa.eu"&gt;http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/country-study-victim-support-services-lu.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Victims’ rights are also actively enforced during the different stages of the criminal justice process, including: during the investigation of a crime, during a trial and after a trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_rights_of_victims_of_crime_in_criminal_proceedings-171-lu-en.do?member=1|title=European e-Justice Portal – Victims of crime|website=e-justice.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state also coordinates with non-profit organisations, including through the provision of financial support, in order to assist in the development of legal reforms and to better coordinate at a grass roots level.&lt;ref name="europa.eu1"&gt;http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra-2015-victims-crime-eu-support_en_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one such organisation, Women in Distress, works to provide women, their children and young girls with effective protection against violence by way of refuges and information and consultation centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justarrived.lu/en/i-am-in-luxembourg/practical-and-useful/associations-2/women-in-distress|title=Women in Distress|website=JUSTARRIVED}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this process, Luxembourg has become one of only nine Member States to fulfil the Council of Europe's recommendation of one counselling centre per 50,000 women.&lt;ref name="europa.eu1" /&gt;

'''Rights of Victims'''

Victims of Crime can report the crime to the police or directly to the public prosecutor.&lt;ref name="europa.eu2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_rights_of_victims_of_crime_in_criminal_proceedings-171-LU-maximizeMS-en.do?clang=en&amp;idSubpage=1&amp;member=1|title=European e-Justice Portal|website=e-justice.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports must be submitted in one of Luxembourg's official languages: Luxembourgish, French and German. An interpreter is available for free of charge for people who do not speak these languages. Statutory limitation periods for reporting apply. Victims are able to be directly involved in the process by acting as witnesses and providing testimony. Interpreters are free of charge and the victims are entitled to be represented by lawyers. Police must undergo a mandatory course on victimology which is partly run by the ‘Service d’aide aux victims’ (SAV). Police are obligated to inform victims of their rights to:

(i)	receive assistance from VSS;
(ii)	compensation for damages;
(iii)	receive legal aid (available on the fulfilment of certain conditions); and
(iv)	to be fully informed about the status of their proceedings. If the case does not proceed to court, reasons for this outcome must be provided in order to help the victim decide whether to appeal this decision.&lt;ref name="europa.eu" /&gt;

'''Compensation'''

In the interest of justice, Luxembourg offers compensation for victims who have suffered physical injuries from crime. Compensation is only paid out in instances were victims were unable to obtain adequate compensation from insurance, social security or from the offender.  In 2012, over 405,000 Euro was paid out in compensation. This exceeded the budgeted amount of 350,000. A request for compensation has to be initiated within two years of an offence occurring and is addressed to the Ministry of justice. A commission formed by a magistrate, senior civil servant of the Minister of Justice and a lawyer will then meet within an applicant to assess if an application is successful. The maximum amount that could be awarded as of 2009 was 63.000 Euros. By way of appeal, legal action against the State can be brought before the ‘tribunal d’arrondissement’ of Luxembourg or Diekirch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mj.public.lu/services_citoyens/indemnisation/en_faq.html|title=Ministère de la Justice – FAQ – Compensation for victims of crime|website=www.mj.public.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Directive 2012/29/EU'''

Directive 2012/29/EU seeks to ensure that all victims of crime have better rights, support and protection throughout all of Europe. Member states, including Luxembourg, were required to implement the terms of the Directive into national legislation by 16 November 2015. However, almost 60% of these have failed to comply with the requirement to communicate the legislative texts which transpose the Directive to the Commission. As Luxembourg is one of these states, it now has an infringement case open against it.&lt;ref name="victimsupport.eu" /&gt;

'''Hotlines
'''

The government of Luxembourg has implemented two telephone hotlines to assist victims of crime. The first, which assists victims in general, can be reached at +352 475 821-628/627.&lt;ref name="europa.eu2" /&gt; The second, directed specifically at youth and children, can be reached at + 352 12345.&lt;ref name="europa.eu2" /&gt;  Further support is available online.

=== Netherlands ===

Criminal Justice in Netherlands has seen an era of reform with a greater focus placed on the rights of victims of crime. In 1987, a new victim-orientated reform was put in place in which victim's interested were to be taken into account during all processes of the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_c42QRbPD80C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=netherlands+crime+victims&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0fRwPH9E00&amp;sig=KijiQsLfmBFXL7se_LQ58oYAvAw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EDGdVdmDOISNywP_44DQCw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=netherlands+crime+victims&amp;f=false|title=Support for Crime Victims in a Comparative Perspective: A Collection of Essays Dedicated to the Memory of Prof. Frederic McClintock|first1=Ezzat A.|last1=Fattah|first2=Tony|last2=Peters|date=17 April 1998|publisher=Leuven University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reform of criminal law in the eyes of victims brought forth regulations in favor of victims’ rights. Various procedural elements allow for victim compensation and institutional obligation to protect victim rights through policing, criminal proceedings and victim rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/comp_crime_victim/comp_crime_victim_net_en.htm|title=European Commission - European Judicial Network - Compensation to crime victims - Netherlands|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, all official institutions are subject to monitoring by the National Ombudsman. If victims of crime feel they have been unjustly treated and victim-related rules were not correctly protected, they are able to raise a complaint with the Ombudsman. In light of this, Netherlands enforces levels of state compensation, which offers a ‘one-off’ payment, and has been institutionalized since 1974.

For further victim support, various NGO's operate within Netherlands on a local level and care for victims of crimes through providing emotional support, practical advice and judicial advice. An example of this support is seen within the nationwide agency [https://www.slachtofferhulp.nl/ Slachtofferhulp] is partly funded by the government and gives aid to victims in specific groups and to victims of crime in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NF04lGWdaEAC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;lpg=PA226&amp;dq=victims+of+crime+lithuania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4XYo8viy31&amp;sig=tUxiNo2vUIip89lvqMvcSOI7mvM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3BKdVevuEKOWygOznbK4Cw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=netherlands&amp;f=false|title=Victims: Support and Assistance|first=Council of|last=Europe|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Council of Europe|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
Domestic violence rates are very high in Poland, due to a number of factors.&lt;ref name="theadvocatesforhumanrights.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/uploads/poland_domestic_violence_2002_10-18-2002_2.PDF|title= Domestic Violence in Poland, July 2002. (8 July 2015)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After surveying Polish women, it was found that as many as one in six women, from a variety of backgrounds and age groups, were victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref name="theadvocatesforhumanrights.org" /&gt; The Polish criminal justice system fails to effectively assist these victims and does not take their cases seriously. Unfortunately many perpetrators only receive suspended sentences and their female partners are often financially dependent on them and must continue to live with them.&lt;ref name="theadvocatesforhumanrights.org" /&gt; Furthermore, the authorities mistrust women who report domestic violence.&lt;ref name="theadvocatesforhumanrights.org" /&gt; Poland fails to meet its obligations under international human rights law, in relation to the rights of domestic violence victims.&lt;ref name="theadvocatesforhumanrights.org" /&gt;

In order to improve the rights of domestic violence victims in Poland, the Blue Card program was introduced as a way of standardising police interaction with those that involved in cases of domestic violence, including the family of the victim.&lt;ref name="Poland 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://providus.lv/upload_file/Projekti/Kriminalitesibas/Victim%20support/5.%20PL.pdf|title= Assistance to Victims of Crime in Poland, 2013. (8 July 2015)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program enables persons who have alleged to be victims of domestic violence (DV) to gain access to services in counseling, support and reparations.&lt;ref name="providus.lv"&gt;[http://providus.lv/upload_file/Projekti/Kriminalitesibas/Victim%20support/5.%20PL.pdf  Assistance to Victims of Crime in Poland, 2013. (8 July 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymous or suspicion of DV is enough for issuance of a "Blue Card – B". A Blue Card – B consists of a brochure detailing further actions against violence, help and support centre's near by, and is applicable to the whole of Poland.&lt;ref name="providus.lv" /&gt; The efficiency of support centres indicates a positive increase in individuals attending victim support centre's, it however does not indicate a decrease in DV occurrence. In 2000 the Ministry of Justice in Poland sparked the notion of "Victim Support Week", connected to the International day of Victims of Crime&lt;ref name="providus.lv" /&gt; These proactive measures are not legally regulated however do show promise in moving the Polish Nation forward to support those effected by domestic violence.

General victim support centres have extended ranges since 2012 following the implementation of tasks in article 11 of the Ministry of justice Directive.&lt;ref name="Poland 2013"/&gt; Such implementation includes covering costs of heath services, medical products, secondary or vocational education, temporary accommodation and other facilities.&lt;ref name="Poland 2013"/&gt; Weak aspects still include; uneven support on a national basis in provinces that are further reaching, non-uniform project development and insufficient numbers for providing assistance, both legally and psychologically.&lt;ref name="Poland 2013"/&gt; Strong aspects however must be acknowledged, including the establishment of networks with communicative and mutual support, as well as assistance fund establishments and legal compensation.&lt;ref name="Poland 2013"/&gt; Social attitudes need to be changed in Poland, towards victims of domestic violence and the criminal justice system needs to recognise the prevalence of domestic violence, in order to hinder its occurrence and assist victims.

=== Portugal ===
In Portugal, victims of crime (both tourists and national citizens) have 6 immediate rights; The Right to Information, The Right to Receive a Statement of the Complaint, The Right to Translation, The Right to Compensation for Participation in the Process and to the Reimbursement of Expenses, The Right to Compensation from the Perpetrator of the Crime, and The Right to Compensation from the Portuguese State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apav.pt/mihy/index.php/know-your-rights|title=APAV -  May I Help You|first=|last=Francisco|website=apav.pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 'victim of crime' is defined as; having "suffered damage, as a result of an incident which constitutes a crime according to national law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_rights_of_victims_of_crime_in_criminal_proceedings-171-pt-en.do?member=1|title=European e-Justice Portal - Victims of crime|website=e-justice.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; During legal proceedings, a victim in Portugal has a limited role, where they act only to provide evidence to support the claim for damages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/comp_crime_victim/comp_crime_victim_por_en.htm|title=European Commission - European Judicial Network - Compensation to crime victims - Portugal|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese Government offers several avenues of help and support for victims of crime such as; the National Commission for Protection of Children and Young People at Risk, Directorate General of Social Affairs, The Portuguese Association for Victim Support, the Commission for Equality and Against Racial Discrimination, and Open Window – Support to Victims of Domestic Violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_rights_of_victims_of_crime_in_criminal_proceedings-171-PT-maximizeMS-en.do?clang=en&amp;idSubpage=5&amp;member=1|title=European e-Justice Portal|website=e-justice.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slovakia ===

Slovakia is a nation where various targeted groups, particularly young women, as well as men, the disabled, the uneducated and the unemployed are commonly susceptible to the likes of fabricated international job prospects; and in turn increase their likelihood of becoming a victim of the human trafficking trade.&lt;ref name="endslavery.va"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endslavery.va/content/endslavery/en/publications/youth_symposium_2014/slovakia.html|title=Human Trafficking in Slovakia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Slovakian's end up being deported to highly active trafficking countries; such as, 'Germany, Austria, the UK, Ireland, Switzerland and Poland'.&lt;ref name="endslavery.va" /&gt; Slovakia is a prominent country which specifically has victims from Bulgaria, Romania, Vietnam, Ukraine and Moldova. People from these countries are then transported against their own will, compelled into sexual activity and prostitution.&lt;ref name="endslavery.va" /&gt;

The Government of the Slovak Republic undertook numerous steps to tackle the fight against human trafficking. In 2005 an Action Plan was initiated to undertake steps to 'control and coordinate' the activity of the slave trade.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/anti-trafficking/content/nip/slovakia_en|title=Together Against Trafficking in Human Beings - European Commission|website=Together Against Trafficking in Human Beings}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Action was further improved with the implementation of the 2011 ''''National Program to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings for the years 2011–2014''''.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu" /&gt; Improvements regarded achieving an effective solution to combat human trafficking.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu" /&gt; Additionally, emphasis surrounded ensuring adequate support and care for subjected victims.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu" /&gt; This includes victims receiving 'comprehensive care' and prepare them for their return to their home country.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu" /&gt;

=== Slovenia ===
Slovenia currently has a very low crime rate (30.75 and 7.32 rapes per million people, as of 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slovenia has regulated the rights of victims of crime during legal proceedings in the Criminal Procedure Act. Before this act was introduced, victims of crime were still entitled to compensation under civil law.
In 2005, the Witness Protection Act, the Crime Victims Compensation Act, and the Resolution for Preventing and Combating Crime came into effect. The Resolution focuses particularly on protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, in terms of victims of crime. Slovenia's definition of victims includes immediate families of the injured party.

Victims are entitled to:
Be heard during proceedings, to give evidence, to pose questions to witnesses and experts involved, to be acquainted with all rights and for the injured party, a right to inspect material evidence supplied. They are also entitled to a translator to avoid language difficulties. Slovene is the national language, but Italian and Hungarian are also spoken in certain regions of Slovenia.
To claim compensation either through the criminal proceedings, or through civil suit if necessary to avoid delays.

In certain criminal offences, such as sexual abuse or mistreatment and neglect of minors or trafficking in human beings, the minor-injured party is required to have a specific authority to look after their rights, and certain stipulations apply to the investigation procedures, such as preventing the offender from being in the courtroom at the same time as the minor-offender during the proceedings.&lt;ref name="coe.int"&gt;{{Citation

Witness protection:
If during criminal proceedings, the physical safety of the victim and/or their immediate families is in danger, they are entitled to the greatest amount of protection possible in pre-trial, during and after the procedure is completed. Within the Slovenian Police, the Endangered Persons Protection Unit specifically oversees the protection of witnesses under the Witness Protection Act. The Unit is also encouraged to engage with non-governmental organizations if necessary in order to provide appropriate psychological and legal assistance to the protected persons, separate from other forms of compensation they may receive. The Unit also allows for alternate measures during proceedings, for example providing evidence via video conference. These are set out in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, as is the Code of Obligation which specifically concerns the rights of victims of terrorist violence in Slovenia.&lt;ref name="coe.int" /&gt;

Code of Obligation regarding victims of terrorist violence:
If terrorist violence occurs, the Code of Obligation states that the state, or the person who should have prevented the harm (depending on whether there was a statewide or individual failure), is responsible for redressing the harms to the victims, and liable for damages. Liability will still apply regardless of whether the person or state who should have prevented the violence, did everything they could to prevent it. These rules also apply to acts of violence that occur during public demonstrations or gatherings.&lt;ref name="coe.int" /&gt;

For victims of crime in Slovenia, there are several websites dedicated to assisting victims understand the process for receiving compensation such as the European Judicial Network (soon to updated to the European e-Justice Portal). Here the process is clearly outlined including conditions for applying for compensation, legal assistance available and the form and amount of evidence required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/civiljustice/comp_crime_victim/comp_crime_victim_sln_en.htm|title=European Commission - European Judicial Network - Compensation to crime victims - Slovenia|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular concern to Slovenia's government is the protection of women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stopvaw.org/slovenia|title=Slovenia|website=www.stopvaw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In place to protect women's right under Slovenian Law are Article 14 of the Constitution of Slovenia which, "guarantees everyone equal human rights and fundamental freedoms" and "equality before the law" as well as article 53 which states, "marriage is based on the equality of both spouses" and "the state shall protect the family",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlada.si/koristno/ostalo/|title=404 Error Page not found|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; article 141 of the Criminal Code "Violation of Right to Equality",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlada.si/koristno/ostalo/|title=404 Error Page not found|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the 2002 Act on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men which imposes punishments on all people, especially an official who can be imprisoned for up to three years for discrimination. The Slovenian government has also established an Office for Equal Opportunities to manage Acts related to equal opportunities and engage in activities which focus on areas such as the inclusion of women political and violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch|title=WomenWatch: UN Information and Resources on Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain ===

''' Resources &amp; Victims Rights '''

Victims of crime in Spain have a number of avenues available to them to seek legal compensation or aid for the damages they have suffered.&lt;ref name="europa.eu3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_rights_of_victims_of_crime_in_criminal_proceedings-171-es-en.do?member=1|title=European e-Justice Portal – Victims of crime|website=e-justice.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Justice&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/cs/Satellite/Portal/en/inicio&lt;/ref&gt; is the state body who is in charge of awarding compensation to victims. It also is responsible for state legal aid, and has a separate department for protection of victims of terrorism-related crimes.&lt;ref name="europa.eu4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_rights_of_victims_of_crime_in_criminal_proceedings-171-ES-maximizeMS-en.do?clang=en&amp;idSubpage=4&amp;member=1|title=European e-Justice Portal|website=e-justice.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the Ministry of Justice, there are organisations such as the Office of Crime Victims Assistance Barcelona, the Association of Terrorism Victims, the 11-M Association of Victims of Terrorism and the National Association of Victims of Violent Crime (which provides psychological assistance and specialises in aiding victims of domestic violence). These associations are all able to assist with legal aid and providing general information to people affected by crime about their rights.&lt;ref name="europa.eu4" /&gt;

If you are a foreign citizen who is a victim of crime in Spain, you should contact your country's embassy or consulate as soon as possible.

''' Legal Process '''

In a criminal trial in Spain, the victim can choose to participate in the trial either as a witness, or as a 'private prosecutor' ('acusación particular') which grants them additional rights and responsibilities, and makes them an official party to the trial.&lt;ref name="europa.eu3" /&gt;

If you wish to claim compensation in Spain, you must submit an application form to the Ministry of Finance, and a separate 'petition for assistance' must be filed with the Ministry of Economy and Finance. There will then be a hearing, and the state attorney will submit a report for consideration. During the hearing, the victim must prove they were legally in Spain at the time of the crime.&lt;ref name="ncjrs.gov1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/ovc_archives/reports/intdir2005/spain.html|title=Victim Compensation Programs: Spain|website=www.ncjrs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If you are a foreign citizen and you wish to apply for compensation, then you must provide evidence during the hearing of situations where your home country has provided compensation similarly for Spanish citizens – this is referred to as 'proof of reciprocity'.&lt;ref name="ncjrs.gov1" /&gt;

''' Compensation '''

Compensation will only be awarded after the criminal trial is concluded and the offender is found guilty. In exceptional circumstances, a victim or the family members of a victim may claim emergency compensation before the conclusion of the trial, if their 'precarious' situation can be validated by the relevant authority.&lt;ref name="ncjrs.gov1" /&gt;
Spanish law does not provide a maximum amount of compensation that can be awarded, but determines a maximum amount for the individual based on different factors. The amount of compensation a victim or their beneficiaries is entitled to is determined based on the minimum monthly salary of the victim, and the negative mental and physical effects the victim suffers as a direct result of the crime. The financial situation of the victim, the number of people dependant on the victim, and the cost of therapy and psychological healthcare are all considered when deciding how much compensation is awarded.&lt;ref name="ncjrs.gov1" /&gt;
Compensation can be awarded to cover medical expenses, mental health expenses, lost wages for disabled victims, lost wages for dependants of homicide victims, and funeral and burial expenses. The compensation amount is paid by the offender, and if they are unable to pay then the Spanish government will cover the amount – however if the victim's losses are covered by insurance (i.e. in circumstances of theft) then they are not eligible for compensation.&lt;ref name="ncjrs.gov1" /&gt;

''' Spain and the Directive on Victims Rights '''

According to the European directive on Victims rights, Spain is showing compliance with the directives. However, information for victims of crime for citizens and non citizens can be quite strenuous to find due to specialised websites for each organisation. In comparison, the UK have implemented one simple to use website for victims of crime which makes information for victims rights far more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.victimsupportsco.org.uk|title=Victim Support Scotland – Home|website=Victim Support Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar system could better help victims of crime in Spain with creating awareness of their rights.

=== Sweden ===

Various laws addressing victim's crimes were enacted from the mid-1980s onward in Sweden.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Dijik|first1=Jan|last2=Groenhuijsen|first2=Marc|editor1-last=Walklate|editor1-first=Sandra|title=Handbook of Victims and Victimology|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-1-84392-257-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 alone, Sweden ratified the European Convention on the compensation of victims of violent crimes and passing the Act on Visiting Bans Act on Counsel for Injured Party in 1988.&lt;ref name="Routledge" /&gt; Crime victims may be represented y a legal advisor throughout the legal process under the provisions of the latter Act. Under the 1994 Government Bill "Crime Victims in Focus" various provisions were designed to improve for crime victims.&lt;ref name="Routledge" /&gt; For example, The Crime Victim Fund established together with the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority allows the assessment of state compensation and provide economic support for research, education and information on crime victims, financed through a few imposed in everyone convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Routledge" /&gt;

Crime victims became a separate area of responsibility for Swedish social services in 2001 through the Social Service Act.&lt;ref name="su.diva-portal.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ljungwald|first1=Carina|title=The Emergence of the Crime Victim in the Swedish Social Services Act|journal=Stockholm Studies in Social Work|volume=28|url=http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:406201/FULLTEXT01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite not actually strengthening crime victims’ rights not increase costs at the time, it served as a normative reorientation of the Social Services Act towards a holistic view and right to assistance according to need.&lt;ref name="su.diva-portal.org" /&gt;

'''Victim-Offender Mediation'''

Swedish multiplicities are obliged to offer mediation, based on restorative justice principles, to offenders under 21 years old.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobsson|first1=Maritha|last2=Wahlin|first2=Lottie|last3=Andersson|first3=Tommy|title=Victimoffender mediation in Sweden: Is the victim better off?|journal=International Review of Victimology|date=2012|volume=18|issue=3|pages=229–249|doi=10.1177/0269758012446985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simultaneously, offenders are offered the chance to deeply apologise for their actions and redeem themselves. The expectation is that mediation has the potential to substantially reduce cases of recidivism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

The mediation system in Sweden evolved independently from any political decision-making procedure in the second half of the 1980s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; In 1998, the role of mediation in the justice system for young offenders was analysed by the Commission on Mediation which then founded their policy recommendations for legislative reforms on these evaluation studies in 2000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; Mediation was formally acknowledged in 2002 by the Mediation Act (Swedish Code of Statutes, 2002:445), where the aim of mediation is explained in Section 3 as:

	''Mediation happens for the interests of both sides. The goal is to reduce the negative effects 	of the crime committed. Mediation aims to help to increase insight for the offender of the 		consequences of the offence. At the same time, opportunities are given to the victims to 		process and finally in a comprehensive way integrate the painful experience.
The act offers the chance for victims to express their emotional needs and have them addressed in an attempt to prevent recurrent symptoms of anxiety, self-image distortions and loss of self-esteem and self-confidence as the result of being victimised.''&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

Mediation is one of several procedural operations available to a prosecutor, and sentencing an offender to mediation may be seen as a lenient sentence where the offender benefits.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; Another criticism is that mediation will further violate the victim's integrity and well-being.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;

=== Romania ===

==== Human Trafficking ====
Human trafficking in Romania is a prominent issue. The country is used as a ‘source, transit and destination country for men, women and children subject to labor trafficking and women and children subject to sex trafficking’,&lt;ref&gt;United States Embassy, "Trafficking Persons Report", United States, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that various victims in different stages of trafficking are either poached from, exploited or transferred to Romanian soil. Promisingly, the numbers have been to decreasing in recent years ( in 2005 there were  2551 recorded victims of human trafficking, in 2009 there were 780)&lt;ref name="unipd-centrodirittiumani.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unipd-centrodirittiumani.it/public/docs/ROMANIA_Chihaia.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709031516/http://unipd-centrodirittiumani.it/public/docs/ROMANIA_Chihaia.pdf|dead-url=no|archive-date=2015-07-09|title=Ministry of Administration and Interior General Inspectorate of Romanian Police, "Romania – The experience of the national agency against trafficking in persons", 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps due to mechanisms such as the National Agency for Preventing Trafficking in Persons and for monitoring the Assistance Granted to Victims of Trafficking in Persons Agency, legal implementations such as Law 678/2001 (combating trafficking in persons); G.D 299/2003 (standard rules for application of Law 678); law 211/2004 (protection of victims) and G.D 1654/2006  to approve the National Strategy against Trafficking to approve the National Strategy against Trafficking in Persons in persons 2006–2010).&lt;ref name="unipd-centrodirittiumani.it" /&gt;   Romania also prescribed to international legal mechanisms such as the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and Council of Europe Convention on Action against trafficking Human Beings, showing that is making a conscious effort to eradicate human trafficking within the state. These mechanisms show that Romania is taking active steps towards ensuring that all individuals can live a life free from exploitation.

==== Violent Crimes ====
Between the years of 2004–2011, 800 people were killed as a result of crimes involving domestic violence&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmuncii.ro/pub/imagemanager/images/file/Proiecte%20legislative/2012-09-20_Anexa1_strategie%20violenta%20sept%202012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological counselling is provided to victims of  attempted homicide, murder, hitting and other violent criminal offences. Counselling is provided free of charge for up to 3 months, and 6 months for victims under the age of 18. Other forms of assistance by not governmental organisations, independent or in partnership, can also be provided by way of referral.&lt;ref name="Romania, 2006, p.1"&gt;Ministry of Justice of Romania, '27th Conference of European Ministers of Justice. Victims: Place, Rights and Assistance', Yerevan, 2006, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon application, free legal aid is provided to several categories of victims. Factors taken into account include the seriousness of the offence committed and material status of the victim. Direct victims of serious violent or sexual offences (e.g., homicide, serious bodily harm, rape, sexual perversion committed upon a minor) are provided with free legal aid. Additionally, indirect victims of such offences, such as close family members, may also be granted free legal aid. For any of the above offences, free legal aid is granted if the offence was committed within Romanian territory, or if the victim is a Romanian citizen or foreign citizen living legally in Romania and the criminal prosecution is taking place within Romania.&lt;ref name="Romania, 2006, p.1" /&gt;

Prior to the commencement of Law 211/2004, when a perpetrator of a crime remained unknown, insolvent, or was missing, the "costs" of the offence were incurred by the victim alone.  Currently, upon application, a victim may be granted financial compensation for serious violent and sexual crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Justice of Romania, '27th Conference of European Ministers of Justice. Victims: Place, Rights and Assistance', Yerevan, 2006, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The birth of the [[National Agency for Family Protection]] ([[NAFP]]) has increased support for victims of domestic violence. The agency has assisted in the setting up of shelters for victims of domestic violence, recuperation centers for victims of violence and assistance centers for aggressors.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Justice of Romania, '27th Conference of European Ministers of Justice. Victims: Place, Rights and Assistance', Yerevan, 2006, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In 1974, the charity Victim Support was set up in Bristol, aimed at providing help and support to victims of crime on a local and national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.victimsupport.org.uk/|title=Victim Support|website=www.victimsupport.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trained volunteers and employees offer free, confidential, practical and emotional support to people affected by crime in England and Wales. The charity offers support to around one million victims of crime per year. People may seek practical or emotional help, for example, making their home secure after a burglary, applying for compensation from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, getting re-housed, or asking for counselling through a GP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28965216|title=Who can child abuse victims turn to?|date=28 August 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victim Support also provides specialist services, such as: a national "homicide service", helping families who have been bereaved by murder or manslaughter, local services helping victims of domestic or sexual violence, exploitation, anti-social behaviour, or hate crime, local services for young victims of crime, including specialist support for children who have to testify in court and for recent victims of grooming, and using restorative justice to help victims.

In Scotland and Northern Ireland, similar services are provided by the charities Victim Support Scotland and Victim Support NI.
