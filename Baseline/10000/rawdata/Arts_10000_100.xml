The '''aircraft design process''' is the [[engineering design process]] by which [[aircraft]] are designed. These depend on many factors such as customer and manufacturer demand, safety protocols, physical and economic constraints etc. For some types of aircraft the design process is regulated by national airworthiness authorities. This article deals with powered aircraft such as [[airplane]]s and [[helicopter]] designs.

Aircraft design is a compromise between many competing factors and constraints and accounts for existing designs and market requirements to produce the best aircraft.

==Design constraints==
===Purpose===
The design process starts with the aircraft's intended purpose. Commercial airliners are designed for carrying a passenger or cargo payload, long range and greater fuel efficiency where as fighter jets are designed to perform high speed maneuvers and provide close support to ground troops. Some aircraft have specific missions, for instance, [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibious airplanes]] have a unique design that allows them to operate from both land and water, some fighters, like the [[Harrier Jump Jet]], have [[VTOL]] (Vertical Take-off and Landing) ability, helicopters have the ability to hover over an area for a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hovering|url=http://www.dynamicflight.com/flight_maneuvers/hovering/|work=Flight maneuvers|publisher=www.dynamicflight.com|accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose may be to fit a specific requirement, e.g. as in the historical case of a [[list of Air Ministry specifications|British Air Ministry specification]], or fill a perceived "gap in the market"; that is, a class or design of aircraft which does not yet exist, but for which there would be significant demand.

===Aircraft regulations===
Another important factor that influences the design of the aircraft are the regulations put forth by [[National aviation authority|national airworthiness authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp14371-lra-2-0-2566.htm#2-7 | title=Airworthiness - Transport Canada | publisher=Transport Canada | work=Airworthiness Directives | access-date=2011-12-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417023605/http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/publications/tp14371-lra-2-0-2566.htm#2-7 | archive-date=2011-04-17 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.casa.gov.au/scripts/nc.dll?WCMS:STANDARD::pc=PC_90822 | title=Airworthiness - CASA | publisher=CASA - Australian Government | work=Airworthiness Directives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airports may also impose limits on aircraft, for instance, the maximum wingspan allowed for a conventional aircraft is 80 m to prevent collisions between aircraft while taxiing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICAO Aerodrome Standards|url=http://www.icao.int/fsix/_Library%5CManual%20Aerodrome%20Stds.pdf|work=ICAO Regulations|publisher=ICAO|accessdate=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial factors and market===
Budget limitations, market requirements and competition set constraints on the design process and comprise the non-technical influences on aircraft design along with environmental factors. Competition leads to companies striving for better efficiency in the design without compromising performance and incorporating new techniques and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Jet Aircraft Design|year=1999|publisher=Arnold Publishers|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-340-74152-X|author=Lloyd R. Jenkinson|author2=Paul Simpkin|author3=Darren Rhodes|page=10|chapter=Aircraft Market}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and ’60s, unattainable project goals were regularly set, but then abandoned, whereas today troubled programs like the [[Boeing 787]] and the [[Lockheed Martin F-35]] have proven far more costly and complex to develop than expected.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt;
More advanced and integrated design tools have been developed.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt; [[Model-based systems engineering]] predicts potentially problematic interactions, while [[Computational science|computational analysis]] and optimization allows designers to explore more options early in the process.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt; Increasing [[automation]] in engineering and manufacturing allows faster and cheaper develoment.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt;
Technology advances from materials to manufacturing enable more complex design variations like multifunction parts.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt; Once impossible to design or construct, these can now be [[3D printed]], but they have yet to prove their utility in applications like the [[Northrop Grumman B-21]] or the re-engined [[A320neo]] and [[737 MAX]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt; [[Airbus and Boeing]] also recognize the economic limits, that the next [[airliner]] generation cannot cost more than the previous ones did.&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/technology-milestones/problems-aerospace-still-has-solve |title= Problems Aerospace Still Has To Solve |date= May 6, 2016 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental factors===
An increase in the number of aircraft also means greater carbon emissions. Environmental scientists have voiced concern over the main kinds of pollution associated with aircraft, mainly noise and emissions. Aircraft engines have been historically notorious for creating noise pollution and the expansion of airways over already congested and polluted cities have drawn heavy criticism, making it necessary to have environmental policies for aircraft noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Travel(Air) - Aircraft Noise|url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air/environment/aircraft_noise_en.htm|work=Mobility and Transport|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=7 October 2011|date=2010-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417003255/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air/environment/aircraft_noise_en.htm#|archive-date=2009-04-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annex 16 - Environmental Protection |url=http://www.icao.int/icaonet/anx/info/annexes_booklet_en.pdf |work=Convention on International Civil Aviation |publisher=ICAO |accessdate=8 October 2011 |page=29 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005040825/http://www.icao.int/icaonet/anx/info/annexes_booklet_en.pdf |archivedate=October 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noise also arises from the airframe, where the airflow directions are changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airframe Noise Reduction|url=http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/docs/chicago/airframe.htm|work=NASA Aeronautics|publisher=NASA|accessdate=7 October 2011|author=William Wilshire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021225904/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/docs/chicago/airframe.htm#|archive-date=2011-10-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improved noise regulations have forced designers to create quieter engines and airframes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment: Aircraft Noise Reduction|url=http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/docs/chicago/noise.htm|work=NASA Aeronautics|publisher=NASA|accessdate=7 October 2011|author=Neal Nijhawan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018200346/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/docs/chicago/noise.htm#|archive-date=2011-10-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emissions from aircraft include particulates, [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Sulfur dioxide]](SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Carbon monoxide]] (CO), various [[oxides]] of [[nitrates]] and unburnt [[hydrocarbons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safeguarding our atmosphere|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/fs10grc.html|work=Fact Sheet|publisher=NASA - Glenn Research Center|accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To combat the pollution, ICAO set recommendations in 1981 to control aircraft emissions.&lt;ref name="Doc 9889"&gt;{{cite web|title=ICAO Airport Air Quality Guidance Manual |url=http://www.icao.int/icaonet/dcs/9889/9889_en.pdf |work=ICAO Guidelines |publisher=ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) |accessdate=7 October 2011 |format=PDF |date=2007-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214220636/http://www.icao.int/icaonet/dcs/9889/9889_en.pdf |archivedate=December 14, 2013 }}(see http://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Documents/Publications/FINAL.Doc%209889.1st%20Edition.alltext.en.pdf for updated manual.&lt;/ref&gt; Newer, environmentally friendly fuels have been developed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biofuel Flight Demonstration|url=http://www.virgin-atlantic.com/en/us/allaboutus/environment/biofuel.jsp|work=Environment|publisher=Virgin Atlantic|accessdate=7 October 2011|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of recyclable materials in manufacturing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aircraft Recycling : Life and times of an aircraft|url=http://www.iata.org/pressroom/airlines-international/august-2011/pages/aircraft-recycling.aspx|work=Pressroom - Airlines International|publisher=IATA|accessdate=7 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027053159/http://www.iata.org/pressroom/airlines-international/august-2011/Pages/aircraft-recycling.aspx#|archive-date=2011-10-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have helped reduce the ecological impact due to aircraft. Environmental limitations also affect airfield compatibility. Airports around the world have been built to suit the topography of the particular region. Space limitations, pavement design, runway end safety areas and the unique location of airport are some of the airport factors that influence aircraft design. However changes in aircraft design also influence airfield design as well, for instance, the recent introduction of new large aircraft (NLAs) such as the superjumbo [[Airbus A380]], have led to airports worldwide redesigning their facilities to accommodate its large size and service requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Aircraft Characteristics Related To Airport Planning|url=http://my.fit.edu/~dkirk/3241/Lectures/Atrgpap.pdf|work=First ATRG Conference, Vancouver, Canada|publisher=Air Transport Research Group of the WCTR Society|accessdate=7 October 2011|author=Alexandre Gomes de Barros|author2=Sumedha Chandana Wirasinghe|format=PDF|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airports prepare for the A380|url=http://atwonline.com/airline-financedata/article/airports-prepare-a380-0309|work=Airline Finance/Data|publisher=ATW (Air Transport World)|accessdate=7 October 2011|author=Sandra Arnoult|date=2005-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety===
The high speeds, fuel tanks, atmospheric conditions at cruise altitudes, natural hazards (thunderstorms, hail and bird strikes) and human error are some of the many hazards that pose a threat to air travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bird hazards|url=http://www.airsafe.com/birds.htm|work=Hazards|publisher=www.airsafe.com|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The human component in air accidents|url=http://www.pilotfriend.com/safe/safety/human_and_accidents.htm|work=Air Safety|publisher=www.pilotfriend.com|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aviation Weather Hazards |url=http://www.navcanada.ca/ContentDefinitionFiles/publications/lak/CanadianPrairies/2-P32E.PDF |work=LAKP Prairies |publisher=www.navcanada.ca |accessdate=12 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216030637/http://www.navcanada.ca/ContentDefinitionFiles/publications/lak/CanadianPrairies/2-P32E.PDF |archivedate=16 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Airworthiness]] is the standard by which aircraft are determined fit to fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airworthiness|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/airworthiness|work=Dictionary|publisher=The Free online Dictionary|accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The responsibility for airworthiness lies with [[National aviation authority|national aviation regulatory bodies]], [[Aircraft manufacturers|manufacturers]], as well as owners and operators.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] sets international standards and recommended practices for national authorities to base their regulations on &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Pages/technology-standards.aspx | title=ICAO regulations | publisher=ICAO | accessdate=May 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www2.icao.int/en/ism/ICAO%20Annexes/Annex%208.pdf | title=Annex 8 - ICAO | publisher=ICAO | accessdate=May 5, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905175315/http://www2.icao.int/en/ism/ICAO%20Annexes/Annex%208.pdf# | archive-date=2012-09-05 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The national regulatory authorities set standards for airworthiness, issue certificates to manufacturers and operators and the standards of personnel training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Jet Aircraft Design|year=1999|publisher=Arnold Publishers|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-340-74152-X|author=L. Jenkinson|author2=P. Simpkin|author3= D. Rhodes|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every country has its own regulatory body such as the [[Federal Aviation Authority]] in USA, [[Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India)|DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation)]] in India, etc.

The aircraft manufacturer makes sure that the aircraft meets existing design standards, defines the operating limitations and maintenance schedules and provides support and maintenance throughout the operational life of the aircraft. The aviation operators include the [[Civil aviation|passenger and cargo airliners]], [[Military aviation|air forces]] and owners of private aircraft. They agree to comply with the regulations set by the regulatory bodies, understand the limitations of the aircraft as specified by the manufacturer, report defects and assist the manufacturers in keeping up the airworthiness standards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Most of the design criticisms these days are built on [[crashworthiness]]. Even with the greatest attention to airworthiness, accidents still occur. Crashworthiness is the qualitative evaluation of how aircraft survive an accident. The main objective is to protect the passengers or valuable cargo from the damage caused by an accident. In the case of airliners the stressed skin of the pressurized fuselage provides this feature, but in the event of a nose or tail impact, large bending moments build all the way through the fuselage, causing fractures in the shell, causing the fuselage to break up into smaller sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crashworthy Design Principles|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=AD0623575|work=Technical Report|publisher=Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC)|accessdate=9 October 2011|author=D. L. Greer|author2=J. S. Breeden|author3=T. L. Heid|date=1965-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the passenger aircraft are designed in such a way that seating arrangements are away from areas likely to be intruded in an accident, such as near a propeller, engine nacelle undercarriage etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.rta.nato.int/PubFullText/RTO/EN/RTO-EN-HFM-113/EN-HFM-113-07.pdf|title=Basic Principles of Crashworthiness|publisher=NATO|author=Dennis F. Shanahan}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the cabin is also fitted with safety features such as oxygen masks that drop down in the event of loss of cabin pressure, lockable luggage compartments, safety belts, lifejackets, emergency doors and luminous floor strips. Aircraft are sometimes designed with emergency [[water landing]] in mind, for instance the [[Airbus A330]] has a 'ditching' switch that closes valves and openings beneath the aircraft slowing the ingress of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Airbus A330-A340 Overhead Panel |url=http://www.smartcockpit.com/data/pdfs/plane/airbus/a340/instructor/A330-A340_Overhead_Pushbuttons.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330161341/http://www.smartcockpit.com/data/pdfs/plane/airbus/a340/instructor/A330-A340_Overhead_Pushbuttons.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 March 2012 |work=Data |publisher=www.smartcockpit.com |accessdate=9 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design optimization==
Aircraft designers normally rough-out the initial design with consideration of all the constraints on their design. Historically design teams used to be small, usually headed by a Chief Designer who knows all the design requirements and objectives and coordinated the team accordingly. As time progressed, the complexity of military and airline aircraft also grew. Modern military and airline design projects are of such a large scale that every design aspect is tackled by different teams and then brought together. In general aviation a large number of light aircraft are designed and built by [[Homebuilt aircraft|amateur hobbyists and enthusiasts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amateur Built Aircraft|url=http://www.faa.gov/aircraft/gen_av/ultralights/amateur_built/|work=General Aviation and Recreational Aircraft|publisher=FAA|accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer-aided design of aircraft==
[[File:Navion in Datcom3d.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The external surfaces of an aircraft modelled in [[MATLAB]]]]
In the early years of aircraft design, designers generally used analytical theory to do the various engineering calculations that go into the design process along with a lot of experimentation. These calculations were labour-intensive and time-consuming. In the 1940s, several engineers started looking for ways to automate and simplify the calculation process and many relations and semi-empirical formulas were developed. Even after simplification, the calculations continued to be extensive. With the invention of the computer, engineers realized that a majority of the calculations could be automated, but the lack of design visualization and the huge amount of experimentation involved kept the field of aircraft design stagnant. With the rise of programming languages, engineers could now write programs that were tailored to design an aircraft. Originally this was done with mainframe computers and used low-level programming languages that required the user to be fluent in the language and know the architecture of the computer. With the introduction of personal computers, design programs began employing a more user-friendly approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aircraft Design Software|url=http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff1997/ct11.html|work=Computer Technology|publisher=NASA|accessdate=29 December 2014 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19990824052440/http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/spinoff1997/ct11.html |archivedate = 24 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2014}}

== Design aspects ==
The main aspects of aircraft design are:
#[[Aerodynamics]]
#[[Powered aircraft|Propulsion]]
#[[Aircraft flight control system|Controls]]
#[[Mass]]
#[[Fixed-wing aircraft#structure|Structure]]

All aircraft designs involve compromises of these factors to achieve the design mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Techniques for Aircraft Configuration Optimization|url=http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/design/optimization1.html|work=Aircraft Design : Synthesis and Analysis|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2011-09-20|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120701103526/http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/design/optimization1.html#|archive-date=2012-07-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wing design ===
{{See also|Wing configuration}}
The wing of a fixed-wing aircraft provides the lift necessary for flight. Wing geometry affects every aspect of an aircraft’s flight. The wing area will usually be dictated by the desired [[stalling speed]] but the overall shape of the [[planform (aeronautics)|planform]] and other detail aspects may be influenced by wing layout factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil jet aircraft design|isbn=0-340-74152-X|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wing can be mounted to the fuselage in high, low and middle positions. The wing design depends on many parameters such as selection of [[aspect ratio]], taper ratio, [[sweepback]] angle, thickness ratio, section profile, [[Washout (aviation)|washout]] and [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil Jet Aircraft design|isbn=0-340-74152-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cross-sectional shape of the wing is its [[airfoil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding aircraft structures|isbn=1-4051-2032-0|author=John Cutler|author2=Jeremy Liber}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the wing starts with the [[Rib (aircraft)|rib]] which defines the airfoil shape. Ribs can be made of wood, metal, plastic or even composites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aero Engineering Vol II Part I|year=1938|publisher=George Newnes|author=Hugh Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wing must be designed and tested to ensure it can withstand the maximum loads imposed by maneuvering, and by atmospheric gusts.

=== Fuselage ===
{{Main|Fuselage}}
The fuselage is the part of the aircraft that contains the cockpit, passenger cabin or cargo hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fuselage Layout|url=http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/fuselayout/fusesection.html|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2011-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010307121441/http://adg.stanford.edu/aa241/fuselayout/fusesection.html#|archive-date=2001-03-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Propulsion ===
[[File:Aircraft engine.jpg|thumb|Aircraft engine]]
{{Main|Aircraft engine}}
Aircraft propulsion may be achieved by specially designed aircraft engines, adapted auto, motorcycle or snowmobile engines, electric engines or even human muscle power. The main parameters of engine design are:{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
 
*Maximum engine thrust available
*Fuel consumption
*Engine mass
*Engine geometry

The thrust provided by the engine must balance the drag at cruise speed and be greater than the drag to allow acceleration. The engine requirement varies with the type of aircraft. For instance, commercial airliners spend more time in cruise speed and need more engine efficiency. High-performance fighter jets need very high acceleration and therefore have very high thrust requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beginner's Guide to Propulsion|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/bgp.html|work=Beginner's Guide|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weight ===
{{Main|Aircraft gross weight}} 
The weight of the aircraft is the common factor that links all aspects of aircraft design such as aerodynamics, structure, and propulsion, all together. An aircraft's weight is derived from various factors such as empty weight, payload, useful load, etc. The various weights are used to then calculate the center of mass of the entire aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aircraft weight and balance|url=http://www.pilotfriend.com/training/flight_training/wt_bal.htm|work=Pilot friend - Flight training|publisher=www.pilotfriend.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The center of mass must fit within the established limits set by the manufacturer.

=== Structure ===
The aircraft structure focuses not only on strength, stiffness, durability ([[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]]), fracture toughness, stability, but also on fail-safety, [[corrosion]] resistance, maintainability and ease of manufacturing. The structure must be able to withstand the stresses caused by [[cabin pressurization]], if fitted, turbulence and engine or rotor vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft Structures|publisher=Elsevier Ltd.|isbn=978-1-85617-932-4|author=T.H.G Megson|edition=4th|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design process and simulation==
{{Expand section|date=December 2011}}
The design of any aircraft starts out in three phases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft Performance and design|year=1999|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-001971-1|pages=382–386|author=John D. Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conceptual Design===
[[File:Br-673.svg|thumb|Conceptual design of a [[Breguet Aviation|Breguet]] 673]]
The first design step, involves sketching a variety of possible aircraft configurations that meet the required design specifications. By drawing a set of configurations, designers seek to reach the design configuration that satisfactorily meets all requirements as well as go hand in hand with factors such as aerodynamics, propulsion, flight performance, structural and control systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft Design - A conceptual approach|year=1992|publisher=American institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|isbn=0-930403-51-7|page=4|author=D. Raymer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is called design optimization. Fundamental aspects such as fuselage shape, wing configuration and location, engine size and type are all determined at this stage. Constraints to design like those mentioned above are all taken into account at this stage as well. The final product is a conceptual layout of the aircraft configuration on paper or computer screen, to be reviewed by engineers and other designers.

===Preliminary design phase===
The design configuration arrived at in the conceptual design phase is then tweaked and remodeled to fit into the design parameters. In this phase, [[wind tunnel]] testing and [[Computational fluid dynamics|computational fluid dynamic]] calculations of the flow field around the aircraft are done. Major structural and control analysis is also carried out in this phase. Aerodynamic flaws and structural instabilities if any are corrected and the final design is drawn and finalized. Then after the finalization of the design lies the key decision with the manufacturer or individual designing it whether to actually go ahead with the production of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft design - A conceptual approach|year=1992|publisher=American institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|isbn=0-930403-51-7|page=5|author=D. Raymer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this point several designs, though perfectly capable of flight and performance, might have been opted out of production due to their being economically nonviable.

===Detail design phase===
This phase simply deals with the fabrication aspect of the aircraft to be manufactured. It determines the number, design and location of [[Rib (aircraft)|ribs]], [[Spar (aviation)|spars]], sections and other structural elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aircraft performance and Design|year=1999|publisher=Mc Graw Hill|isbn=0-07-001971-1|author=John D. Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All aerodynamic, structural, propulsion, control and performance aspects have already been covered in the preliminary design phase and only the manufacturing remains. [[Flight simulator]]s for aircraft are also developed at this stage.

== Program development ==

An existing aircraft program can be developed for performance and economy gains by stretching the [[fuselage]], increasing the [[MTOW]], enhancing the aerodynamics, installing new [[aircraft engine|engine]]s, new wings or new avionics.
For a 9,100 nmi long range at Mach 0.8/FL360, a 10% lower [[Thrust specific fuel consumption|TSFC]] saves 13% of fuel, a 10% [[Lift-to-drag ratio|L/D]] increase saves 12%, a 10% lower [[OEW]] saves 6% and all combined saves 28%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://download.nap.edu/cart/download.cgi?record_id=11837 |title= Improving the Efficiency of Engines for Large Nonfighter Aircraft |author= Committee on Analysis of Air Force Engine Efficiency Improvement Options for Large Non-fighter Aircraft |work= [[US Air Force]] Studies Board - Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences |publisher= [[US National Research Council]] |isbn= 0-309-66765-8 |date= 2007 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Apse of Sant Climent de Taüll''''' ({{lang-ca|Absis de Sant Climent de Taüll}}) is a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[fresco]] in the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]], [[Barcelona]]. This is one of the masterpieces of the [[European Romanesque]].&lt;ref&gt;Guide of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which the unknown [[Master of Taüll]] takes his name.  Painted in the early 12th century, it was in the church of [[Sant Climent de Taüll]] at the [[Vall de Boí]], [[Alta Ribagorça]] in the Catalan [[Pyrenees]] until removed in 1919-1923, along with other parts of the fresco decoration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museunacional.cat/en/colleccio/apse-sant-climent-de-taull/mestre-de-taull/015966-000 The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The apse has been replaced in the church by a replica, and some original decoration remains there. MNAC Barcelona also has the paintings from the triumphal arches, a side apse, the consecration inscription and an earlier window.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museunacional.cat/en/colleccio/apse-sant-climent-de-taull/mestre-de-taull/015966-000 The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Its genius lies in the way it combines elements from different Biblical visions (''[[Revelation]]'', ''[[Isaiah and Ezekiel]]'') to present the ''[[Christ of the Day of Judgement]]''. Christ appears from the background causing a movement outwards from the centre of the composition, which is presided by the ornamental sense of the outlines and the skilful use of colour to create volume. The exceptional nature of this work and its pictorial strength have reached out to modernity and fascinated twentieth-century avant-garde artists like [[Picasso]] and [[Francis Picabia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museunacional.cat/en/colleccio/apse-sant-climent-de-taull/mestre-de-taull/015966-000 The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The round surface beneath Christ’s feet represents the earth and the halo on his head represents divinity. Christ’s right hand symbolizes blessing, and in his left hand he holds a book with the words EGO SUM LUX MUNDI, which translates in English to “I am the light of the world”. The symbols of Alpha and Omega hanging like lamps on either side of Christ, symbolize the beginning and end. The fourfold images represent four evangelists. To the right, an angel is seen beside the lion holding one of its hind legs, which is a symbol of St. Mark. To the left, an angel holding the tail of the bull is a symbol of St. Luke. The other two evangelists fit into the triangular space on either side of the mandorla. An angel holding the Gospel Book represents St. Matthew, and the other angel is St. John holding an eagle in his arms. Below the mural painting of Christ in the mandorla is St Thomas, St Bartholomew, Mother of God, St. John the Evangelist, St. James and San Felipe. The Mother of God holds a bowl where red rays emerge from it, which symbolize the blood of Christ.

== History ==
The paintings in the central apse of Sant Climent in Taüll are the most emblematic in the Museum’s collection of Romanesque art and make up one of the most representative and one of the finest works of Romanesque art.

The central theme of the apse is a Theophany, or vision of God, at the end of time, based mainly on the text of Revelation. In the middle, Christ in Majesty inscribed in a mandorla, seated on the arc of Heaven and with the Earth at his feet, blesses
with his right hand, while his left holds a book with the inscription EGO SUM LUX MUNDI (‘I am the light of the world’). On either side are the Alpha and the Omega, symbols that God is the beginning and the end of all things. He is surrounded by
the four Evangelists. Saints, apostles and the Virgin Mary occupy the semi-cylinder and several scenes from the Old and New Testaments are depicted on the arches over the entrance to the apse. One scene that stands out is of Lazarus the beggar at
the door of the rich man Epulon’s house, on the intrados of the arch, and at the top, the hand of God and the Agnus Dei (the Lamb of God), symbolising the death and resurrection of Christ (Rev 5, 6-14).

The style combines the geometricisation of forms and the general symmetry of the composition with the decorativism in the details and ornamental elements.

The volume of the pronounced drapery is geometrical, emphasised by coloured lines and glazing, contrasting with the flat tones of the background. In addition, the symmetry, frontality, hieratic nature and the very representation of God could
derive from Byzantine art, possibly via Italy. The bands of colour in the backgrounds, present in many Catalan Romanesque paintings, could remind us of what is known as Mozarabic illumination in tenth-century Hispanic manuscripts.

The exceptional artistic nature and the high quality of these paintings have been corroborated by the study of the pigments, which are of better quality and preparation than in other Catalan churches. Some imported pigments have even been found.
Through the use of superimposed layers, the painter obtains more intense chromatic effects. Thus blue, obtained from aerinite, is applied over a layer of black, and cinnabar is applied over haematite to get red.

Painted on one of the columns of the nave is the church’s inscription of consecration by bishop Ramon de Roda from Ribagorza on 10 December 1123. This reference is fundamental for dating the paintings, of which there are still remains in situ.

The '''Berlin Biennale''' (full name: Berlin Biennale für zeitgenössische Kunst, Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art) is a [[contemporary art]] exhibition, which has been held at various locations in [[Berlin]], Germany, every two to three years since 1998. The curator or curators choose the artists who will participate. After the event became established, annual themes were introduced. The Biennale is now underwritten by the German government through the Kulturstiftung des Bundes (Federal Culture Foundation), and is the second most important contemporary arts event in the country, after [[documenta]].&lt;ref name=Mauer&gt;Karin Schmidl, [http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/biennale-kunst-in-der-friedrichstrasse-mauerfall-in-kreuzberg,10809148,16329348.html "Biennale-Kunst in der Friedrichstraße: Mauerfall in Kreuzberg"], ''[[Berliner Zeitung]]'', 9 June 2012 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kito Nedo, [http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/kultur/bundeskulturstiftung-wer-sucht--bleibt-in-bewegung,10809150,16443528.html "Bundeskulturstiftung: Wer sucht, bleibt in Bewegung"], ''Berliner Zeitung'', 22 June 2012 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berlin Biennale was co-founded on 26 March 1996 by [[Klaus Biesenbach]] and a group of collectors as well as patrons of art.

==Chronology==

===1st Berlin Biennale===
The first exhibition ran from 30 September to 30 December 1998 and was curated by [[Klaus Biesenbach]], [[Hans-Ulrich Obrist]] and [[Nancy Spector]]. It took place in the [[Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art]] in [[Mitte|Berlin-Mitte]], at the [[Akademie der Künste]] in [[Pariser Platz]] and at the postal centre in [[Oranienburger Straße]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130825114332/http://www.berlinbiennale.de/blog/en/1st-6th-biennale/1st-berlin-biennale The 1st Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art], Berlin Biennale.

During the opening week, the [[Thailand|Thai]] artist [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]] catered a banquet for 1,000 guests in the post office gymnasium, and a three-night combination symposium and festival, ''Congress 3000'', took place in the [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt|House of World Cultures]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunstaspekte.de/index.php?action=termin&amp;tid=24139 1.

===2nd Berlin Biennale===
The Second Berlin Biennale ran from 20 April to 20 June 2001 and included works by approximately 50 artists (deliberately fewer than at the first&lt;ref name=BerlinerZeitung5/&gt;) from more than 30 countries, several of them very young. It was curated by [[Saskia Bos]], who adopted the theme of "connectedness, contribution and commitment" and sought to reject commercially oriented art while fostering engagement with the public in order to "exhibit a utopian sociability in art".&lt;ref&gt;Philip Monk, "2nd Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art", ''Parachute'', 1 October 2001 ([http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-30203328.html Online] at Highbeam, subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; Works were again exhibited at the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art and the postal centre in Oranienburger Straße as well as under the elevated [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] at Jannowitzbrücke and the Allianz Building, known as the [[Treptowers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130220102525/http://www.berlinbiennale.de/blog/1-6-biennale/2-biennale 2.

===3rd Berlin Biennale===
The Third Berlin Biennale took place from 14 February to 18 April 2004 and was directed by [[Ute Meta Bauer]], who chose five themes, or "hubs," titled Migration, Urban Conditions, Sonic Landscapes, Modes and Scenes, and Other Cinema, in order to focus on artistic conversation and on the specific circumstances of post-[[Cold War]] Berlin. The Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art was again used as a site; additional sites included the [[Martin Gropius Bau]] and, for the exhibition of 35 cinematic works, the cinema Kino Arsenal at [[Potsdamer Platz]]. There were several collaborations with various Berlin cultural institutions, a partnership with the Friends of the [[Deutsche Kinemathek]], and a weekly special radio broadcast, reboot.fm. The event ended with a three-day multi-media ''Performance Jam'' on the final weekend.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130220102537/http://www.berlinbiennale.de/blog/1-6-biennale/3-biennale 3.

===4th Berlin Biennale===
The Fourth Berlin Biennale ran from 25 March to 5 June 2006, curated by [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Massimiliano Gioni]], and [[Ali Subotnick]], known collectively as the [[Wrong Gallery]] after a project they did in New York. Titled ''Von Mäusen und Menschen'' (Of Mice and Men) and conceived of as an extended narrative or life cycle, the Fourth Berlin Biennale featured works by [[Mircea Cantor]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Ján Mančuška]], and [[Thomas Schütte]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Hanno Rauterberg, [http://www.zeit.de/2006/14/Biennale/komplettansicht "In der Matschpfütze des Seins.

===6th Berlin Biennale===
The Sixth Berlin Biennale ran from 11 June to 8 August 2010 and was headed by [[Kathrin Rhomberg]]. It was preceded by Project Artists Beyond, sponsored by the [[European Commission]], which sought to showcase the process of artistic creation through exhibits in public places. This began in January and involved seven artists in [[Amsterdam]], [[Istanbul]], [[Pristina]], Copenhagen, [[Vienna]], and Paris in addition to Berlin. The title of this Biennale was ''was draußen wartet'' (what is waiting out there) and the guiding question was "Glauben Sie an die Wirklichkeit?" (Do you believe in reality?). More than 40 artists were featured. Rhomberg chose sites in parts of the city inhabited by large numbers of migrants and invited the New York art critic [[Michael Fried]] to mount an exhibition on the drawings of the 19th-century artist [[Adolph Menzel]] in association with the [[Alte Nationalgalerie]] and the [[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin|Museum of Prints and Drawings]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike Münter, [http://www.de-cn.net/mag/bku/de6029924.htm 6.

The 9th Berlin Biennale stirred some controversy among critics and audiences. James Farago, of ''[[The Guardian]]'', wrote a scathing review, describing the art event as “an ultra-slick, ultra-sarcastic biennial, replete with ads, avatars, custom security guard uniforms, a manic social media presence disposed to hashtags like #BiennaleGlam, and a woman lip syncing to Trap Queen.” 

Other critics lauded the Biennale; in the September 2016 Issue of Artforum, British artist [[Hannah Black]] wrote that “…They [DIS] have been greeted, just like the modernist avant-gardes were in their time, with accusations of bad politics and even worse taste.

Piero Bisello concluded that “Regardless of what we thought Berlin Biennale 2016 would be, we can now claim it is for us a milestone in art history, whether by that history we mean the last centuries, the last years, the last days, the last hours, the last fashion seasons.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bisello|first1=Piero|title=Berlin Biennale 2016: last goodbye to the prematurely dead post-internet label|url=https://www.conceptualfinearts.com/cfa/2016/06/07/berlin-biennale-2016-last-goodbye-to-the-prematurely-dead-post-internet-label/|publisher=Conceptual Fine Arts|date=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tess Edmonson wrote For ''Art Agenda'' that “As a whole, the biennial articulates the sense that disengaging from networks of capital and power is neither effective nor interesting nor possible, instead performing its own complicity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edmonson|first1=Tess|title='The Present in Drag,' 9th Berlin Biennale|url=http://www.art-agenda.com/reviews/%E2%80%9Cthe-present-in-drag%E2%80%9D-9th-berlin-biennale/|publisher=Art Agenda|date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year later art historian [[:de:Susanne von Falkenhausen|Susanne von Falkenhausen]] commented on the controversial nature of the 9th Biennale: "Finding myself confronted with such a unified front of fantasies, rhetorics, pretensions and desires for authenticity in 2017, I confess that I revised my reaction to DIS’s 2016 Berlin Biennale 9, ‘The Present in Drag’. That exhibition rigorously, to the point of cynicism, followed the web 2.0 world of digital prosumer reality and the moral ambiguity of its promises and aesthetics. In my view, it catered to a young, white, middle-class audience, but now it strikes me as more realistic than what we are seeing today: an outsourcing to the (post-)colonial other of the political, guilt, spiritual desire and collectivity that plague the Western-Northern self."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=von Falkenhausen|first1=Susanne|title=Get Real|url=https://frieze.com/article/get-real-0|publisher=FRIEZE|date=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Girl in chibi style.svg|thumb|right|Example for a character drawn in chibi style]]
{{nihongo|'''Chibi'''|ちび or チビ|}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] slang word describing something short (a thing, an animal or a person). It comes from the verb 禿びる (chibiru), which means "to wear out and become shorter" (for the tip of something).{{cn|date=March 2018}} The term is widely used in Japan to describe a specific style of [[caricature]] where characters are drawn in an exaggerated way. Typically these characters are small and chubby, with stubby limbs and oversized heads to make them resemble children. This style of artwork, also known as '''super deformed''', has since found its way into [[anime]] and [[manga]] fandom through its usage in manga works. "Chibi" can be translated as "little"(e.g. [[Chibi Maruko-chan]], which means Little Miss Maruko etc.), but is not used the same way as ''chiisana'' [小さな] / ''chiisai'' [小さい] (tiny, small, little in Japanese) but rather cute.{{cn|date=March 2018}} One example of the usage in Japanese which brought the term to the attention of Western fans is [[Chibiusa]], a [[hypocoristic|pet name]] for the [[:wiktionary:diminutive|diminutive]] daughter of [[Sailor Moon (character)|Sailor Moon]] formed from ''Chibi Usagi'' ("Little Rabbit").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurozuki.com/takeuchi/sailormoon/volume03.html |title=Sailor Moon volume 3 translation |accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proportions==
The head of a super deformed character is normally anywhere between one third&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakaneko.com/howto/figure/chibi/index.html "A Super Deformed Tutorial"] on Bakaneko.com&lt;/ref&gt; and one half the character's height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polykarbon.com/tutorials/chibi/chibiart.htm|title=Action Tutorial|website=www.polykarbon.com|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their modified proportions, super deformed characters typically lack the detail of their normal counterparts. As a result, when a character of average proportions is depicted as a super deformed character, certain aspects of his or her design will be simplified and others will be exaggerated. Details such as folds on a jacket are ignored, and general shapes are favored. If a character has a signature characteristic (odd hair, a particular accessory, etc.) this will typically be prominent on the super deformed version of the character.&lt;ref&gt;''[[How to Draw Manga]] Volume 18: Super-Deformed Characters 1: Humans''.  {{ISBN|9784766114355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media usage==
The "chibi" art style is part of [[Japanese culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wowjapan.asia/2017/08/japanese-student-turns-philosophers-super-deformed-anime-style-characters/|title=Japanese student turns philosophers into super-deformed anime-style characters - WOWJAPAN|date=4 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/185406/Clash_of_Clans_5_keys_to_success.php|title=Clash of Clans ' 5 keys to success|first=Mike|last=Rose|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smosh.com/smosh-pit/articles/why-japan-hands-down-coolest-country-planet|title=Why Japan Is Hands Down The Coolest Country On The Planet - SMOSH|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is seen everywhere from advertising and subway signs to [[anime]] and [[manga]].  The style was popularized by franchises like ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' and ''[[SD Gundam]]'' in the 1980s.{{cn|date=March 2018}} It is also used as [[comic relief]] in anime and manga, giving additional emphasis to a character's [[Emotion|emotional]] reaction.

The super deformed art style has also appeared in anime-influenced American series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A7142/datastream/OBJ/download/Applying_2D_Japanese_Super-Deformed_character_to_traditional_American_animation.pdf|title=Applying 2D Japanese Super-Deformed character to traditional American animation|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, such as ''[[Homestuck]]'', ''[[Teen Titans (TV Series)|Teen Titans]]'' or ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'''s Super Deformed shorts.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The '''Cresta International Advertising Awards''' are a worldwide awards whose purpose is to acknowledge high standards of creative achievement in the international [[advertising]] and [[marketing communications]] industry. It functions through an alternative judging process based upon narrow criteria.&lt;ref name="Riding"&gt;Hooper, Sally: [http://the-gma.com/archives/riding-the-cresta-of-a-creative-wave-international-advertising-awards-finalists-line-up Riding the Cresta of a creative wave - international advertising awards finalists line up] gma: The Global Marketing Alliance, July 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The awards, launched in 1993 by Creative Standards International in partnership with the [[International Advertising Association]],&lt;ref name="About.com Entry"&gt;Duncan, Apryl: [http://advertising.about.com/od/awards/a/adawards_2.htm About: Awards for Advertising] About.com&lt;/ref&gt; were spearheaded by Nancy Ross, who had beforehand helped to run the [[Clio Awards]] for 16 years.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;Elliott, Stuart: [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/23/business/media-business-advertising-new-award-for-ad-creativity-cresta-joins-long-line.html THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; A new award for ad creativity, the Cresta, joins a long line of aspirants for the title of the next Clio.] The New York Times, February 23, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Cresta, which stands for "Creative Standards",&lt;ref name="New Straits"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Time for the Cresta International Advertising Awards |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19990228&amp;id=V6JOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zRQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2444,1856283 |deadurl=no |newspaper=New Straits Times |location=Malaysia |publisher=The New Straits Times Press ||date=1999-02-28 |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; has grown to cover twelve distinct groups of competition: Press, Outdoor, Ambient Media, TV/Cinema/Online Film, Interactive, Radio, Direct Marketing, Design, Incentives &amp; Promotions, Branded Entertainment, Crafts and Integrated Campaigns.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;[http://www.cresta-awards.com/About.aspx About Cresta]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cresta's U.S. headquarters is located in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Contact"&gt;[http://www.cresta-awards.com/Contact.aspx Contact Cresta]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judging ==
Cresta is an extensive and highly selective awards program, an official 2017 press release noting a reception of more than 3,300 entries from 53 countries for the 2016 competition, with 74 entries from 13 countries designated as winners.&lt;ref name="2014 Press"&gt;[http://www.cresta-awards.com/Press.aspx Cresta Awards Issue Call for Entries in Its 25th Annual Worldwide Creative Competition] Press Release, February 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Entries are screened by several international "pre-selection" juries responsible for compiling a shortlist to be given to a Grand Jury of seasoned creative directors, graphic artists, and film specialists from around the world. The Cresta Grand Jury, unlike the pre-selection juries, is a permanent jury consisting of 86 members from 45 countries. Members judge the shortlisted entries on their own time and individually, the no-discussion policy placing stress on creativity solely.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt; This body decides on the Gold, Silver, and Bronze winners, as well as if an entry has met the pre-determined standard of earning a '''Grand Prix''' award, based on two elements: originality of the idea and the quality of the idea's execution.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New Straits" /&gt;  

In 2010, Cresta introduced the '''Network of the Year''' and '''Agency of the Year''' honors, given out to those whose entries meet the highest scores, based on a point breakdown, in all levels of competition.&lt;ref name="2010 Press"&gt;[http://www.cresta-awards.com/PressArchive.aspx 18th Annual Cresta International Advertising Awards Announce Winners] Press Release, October 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Cresta Statue.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The statue for the Cresta Awards|Cresta Award{{deletable image-caption|Sunday, 20 April 2014}}]] --&gt;
For its first 12 years in existence, Cresta held its awards ceremony in a number of cities throughout the world, including [[Budapest]], [[Milan]], and [[New York City|New York]]. It was determined after the 2004 awards that future winners would be announced via an online ceremony, allowing exponentially more participants the chance to view the winners.&lt;ref name= "About" /&gt; The annual winners are currently released in a virtual showcase designed for all electronic devices, including mobile phones and tablets.&lt;ref name= "Gallery"&gt;[http://www.cresta-awards.com/Award_Ceremony.aspx Cresta Winners Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Cresta statuette is a crystal "S" shape with an embedded metal "C" component, together meant to embody the "Creative Standards" namesake. This component is color-coded in order to reflect the four levels of winners: Grand Prix, Gold, Silver and Bronze.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

Entries submitted must be "broadcast, published or released in a commercial environment with client approval" according to a specific timeframe, and additionally accompanied by the respective single or campaign entry fees.&lt;ref name="Current"&gt;[http://www.cresta-awards.com/EntryKit_CurrentInfo.aspx Current Info and Deadlines]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Distinguish|Curate}}
[[File:Réaccrochage de la salle IItalie-Espagne après la guerre 1914-1918.jpg|thumb|right|In the center of the picture, Emile Theodore (museum curator of the [[w:Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille|Palace of Fine Arts in Lille (museum)]] from 1912 to 1937, here during reconstruction of the gallery dedicated to Spanish and Italian paintings, two years after the end of the First World War]]

A '''curator''' (from {{lang-la|cura}}, meaning "to take care")&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Curator |volume=7 |page=636}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a manager or overseer. Traditionally, a curator or '''keeper''' of a [[cultural heritage]] institution (e.g., [[Art museum|gallery]], [[museum]], [[library]], or [[archive]]) is a content specialist charged with an institution's [[Collection (artwork)|collections]] and involved with the [[Heritage interpretation|interpretation]] of heritage material.

A traditional curator's concern necessarily involves tangible objects of some sort — artwork, collectibles, historic items, or scientific collections. More recently, new kinds of curators have started to emerge: [[digital curation|curators of digital data objects]] and [[biocurator]]s.

== Curation scope ==
In smaller organizations, a curator may have sole responsibility for acquisitions and even for [[collections care]]. The curator makes decisions regarding what objects to select, oversees their potential and documentation, conducts research based on the collection and its history, provides proper [[packaging and labeling|packaging]] of art for transportation, and shares  research with the public and community through exhibitions and publications. In very small, volunteer-based museums such as those of local historical societies, a curator may be the only paid staff-member.

In larger institutions, the curator's primary function is that of a subject specialist, with the expectation that he or she will conduct original research on objects and guide the organization in its collecting. Such institutions can have multiple curators, each assigned to a specific collecting area (e.g., curator of ancient art, curator of prints and drawings, etc.) and often operating under the direction of a head curator. In such organizations, the physical care of the collection may be overseen by museum collections-managers or by museum conservators, with documentation and administrative matters (such as personnel, insurance, and loans) handled by a museum registrar.

In the United Kingdom, the term "curator" also applies to government employees who monitor the quality of contract archaeological work under [[PPG 16|Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and Planning (PPG 16)]] and manage the cultural resource of a region. In the museum setting, a curator in the United Kingdom may also be called a "keeper".

In Scotland, the term "curator" is also used to mean the guardian of a child, known as [[Curator ad litem|curator ''ad litem'']].{{citation needed|date= February 2014}}

In the US, curators have multifaceted tasks dependent on the particular institution and its mission. But in recent years{{when?|date=March 2018}} the role of the curator has evolved alongside the changing role of museums. As US museums have become increasingly more digitized, curators find themselves constructing narratives in both the material and digital worlds. Historian Elaine Gurian has called for museums in which "visitors could comfortably search for answers to their own questions regardless of the importance placed on such questions by others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clough |first=Wayne |title=Best of Both Worlds: Museums, Libraries and Achieves in the Digital Age |date=2013 |publisher= [[The Smithsonian Institution]] |page=30 |url=http://www.si.edu/content/gwc/BestofBothWorldsSmithsonian.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would change the role of curator from teacher to "facilitator and assistor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clough |first=Wayne |title=Best of Both Worlds: Museums Libraries and Archives in a Digital World |date=2013 |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution |page=30 |url=http://www.si.edu/content/gwc/BestofBothWorldsSmithsonian.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this sense, the role of curator in the United States is precarious, as digital and interactive exhibits often allow members of the public to become their own curators, and to choose their own information. Citizens are then able to educate themselves on the specific subject they are interested in, rather than spending time listening to information they have no desire to learn.

More recently,{{when?|date=March 2018}} advances{{which?|date=March 2018}} in new technologies have led to a further widening of the role of curator. This has been a focus in major art institutions internationally and has become an object of academic study and research.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In [[contemporary art]], the title "curator" identifies a person who selects and often interprets works of art. In addition to selecting works, the curator is often responsible for writing labels, catalog essays, and other content supporting exhibitions. Such curators may be permanent staff members, "guest curators" from an affiliated organization or university, or "freelance curators" working on a consultancy basis. The late-20th century saw an explosion of artists organizing exhibitions. The artist-curator has a long tradition of influence, notably featuring Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] (1723-1792), inaugural president of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], London, founded in 1768.

In some US cultural organizations, the term "curator" may designate the head of any given division. This has led to the proliferation of titles such as "Curator of Education" and "Curator of Exhibitions". The term "literary curator" has been used to describe persons who work in the field of poetry, such as former [[92nd Street Y]] poetry-director [[Karl Kirchwey]].&lt;ref name=twsOctB75544&gt;{{cite news

In Australia and New Zealand the term also applies to a person who prepares a sports ground for use (especially a [[Cricket field| cricket ground]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blogs.espncricinfo.com/thebuzz/archives/2010/12/adelaide_curator_annoys_kp.php|title= The Cordon – Cricket Blogs – ESPN Cricinfo|work= Cricinfo|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101204114323/http://blogs.espncricinfo.com/thebuzz/archives/2010/12/adelaide_curator_annoys_kp.php|archivedate= December 4, 2010|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This job is equivalent to that of [[Groundskeeping|groundsman]] in some other cricketing nations.

In France, the term curator is translated as ''conservateur''. There are two kinds of curators: heritage curators (''conservateurs du patrimoine'') with five specialities (archeology, archives, museums, historical monuments, natural science museums), and librarian curators (''conservateurs des bibliothèques''). These curators are selected by competitive examination and attend the INP (Institut National du Patrimoine)&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Institut national du patrimoine (France)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason= per WP:CIRCULAR|date= November 2017}}. The "conservateurs du patrimoine" are civil servants or work in the public service; the use of the title by private workers is not possible.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

== Education and training ==
Curators hold a high academic degree in their subject, typically a Doctor of Philosophy or a master's degree in subjects such as history, [[history of art]], art, [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], or [[classics]].&lt;ref name="times-how-do-i"&gt;Carly Chynoweth, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/student/how_to_get_a_job/article989842.ece ''How do I become a museum curator?''] December 22, 2006, Times Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="day-in-the-life"&gt;Valarie Kinkade, [http://www.aam-us.org/pubs/webexclusive/kinkade.cfm ''Day in the life: curator.''] American Alliance of Museums&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edubook-how-to"&gt;Stephanie A. Harper, [http://www.edubook.com/how-to-become-a-museum-curator/8589/ ''How to become a museum curator.''] July 6, 2009, Edubook&lt;/ref&gt; Curators are also expected to have contributed to their academic field, for example, by delivering public talks, publishing articles, or presenting at specialist academic conferences.&lt;ref name="times-how-do-i" /&gt; It is important that curators have knowledge of the current collecting market for their area of expertise, and are aware of current ethical practices and laws that may impact their organisation's collecting.&lt;ref name="curcom-ethics"&gt;[http://www.aam-us.org/docs/continuum/curcomethics.pdf ''A code of ethics for curators.''] 2009, American Alliance of Museums Curators Committee&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="combatting-illicit-trade"&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Combating_Illicit_Trade05.pdf ''Combatting Illicit Trade: Due diligence guidelines for museums, libraries and archives on collecting and borrowing cultural material.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927233414/http://culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Combating_Illicit_Trade05.pdf |date=September 27, 2010 }} October 2005, Department for Culture, Media and Sport&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased complexity of many museums and cultural organisations has prompted the emergence of professional programs in fields such as public history, [[public humanities]], [[Museology|museum studies]], [[Arts administration|arts management]], and curating/curatorial practice.&lt;ref name="hang-it-all"&gt;Niru Ratnam, [https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/mar/09/features.magazine47 ''Hang it all.''] March 9, 2003, The Observer&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[Royal College of Art]] established an MA course co-funded by the Royal College of Art and the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], the first in Britain to specialise in curating with a particular focus on [[contemporary art]]. The course is now funded by [[Arts Council England]], and in 2001 the course title was amended to Curating Contemporary Art to more accurately reflect the content and primary focus of the programme.&lt;ref name="cca-intro"&gt;[http://www.cca.rca.ac.uk/docs/introduction/index.htm ''Curating contemporary art.'']{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Royal College of Art&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a number of contemporary art institutions launched curatorial study courses as an alternative to traditional academic programs. Established in 1987, the École du Magasin is a curatorial training program based at the art center [[Le Magasin]] in Grenoble, France. Similarly, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], through its independent study program, hosts a curatorial program as one of its three study areas, and [[de Appel]] arts centre has hosted a curatorial programme since 1994. Other institutions that run programs in curating include [[Norwich University of the Arts]]; The Courtauld Institute of Art, London, UK, [[Kingston University]]; [[Goldsmiths, University of London]]; [[Birkbeck, University of London]]; [[Chelsea College of Arts]]; [[University of the Arts London]]; [[California College of the Arts]]; [[University of Southern California]]; [[Bard College]]; [[School of Visual Arts]]; the [[École du Louvre]]; the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage), [[University of Rennes 2 – Upper Brittany|University of Rennes 2—Upper Brittany]]; [[OCAD University]]; and [[University of Melbourne]].

== Community curation ==
Community curation - alternately known as public curation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Kris | last1=Morrissey | first2=Tom | last2=Satwicz |title=“Public Curation: From Trend to Research-Based Practice” in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go?

Community members involved in community curation are likely not trained as museum professionals, but have vested interests in the outcomes of curatorial projects. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLean|first=Kathleen|title=“Whose Questions, Whose Conversations?” in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go?

Community curation practices are varied. The [[Wing Luke Museum of the Asian Pacific American Experience|Wing Luke Museum]] conducts community outreach at the beginning of exhibition projects, and convenes community advisory committees at various stages in the curatorial process. &lt;ref name=broom&gt;{{cite news | last = Chinn | first = Cassie | title = Push Me, Pull You | newspaper=[[Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage]] |date = June 22, 2012 | url=https://www.pewcenterarts.org/post/push-me-pull-you-cassie-chinn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brooklyn Historical Society]] has accepted exhibit proposals from community members and trained them in curatorial skills to co-create exhibits. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=Deborah|title=“Community as Curator: A Case Study at the Brooklyn Historical Society” in Bill Adair, Benjamin Filene, and Laura Koloski, eds., Letting Go?

== Technology and society ==
In the same way that a museum curator may acquire objects of relevance or an art curator may select or interpret a work of art, the injection of technology and impact of [[social media]] into every aspect of society has seen the emergence of technology curators.

Technology curators are people who are able to disentangle the science and logic of a particular technology and apply it to real world situations and society, whether it is for social change, commercial advantage, or other purposes. The first UK ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' Conference had a test lab, where an independent curator selected technology that showcased radical technology advancements and their impact on society, such as the ability to design and [[3D printing|"print"]] physical objects using [[3D printer]]s (such as a fully working violin) or the ability to model and represent accurate interactive medical and molecular models in stereoscopic 3D.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiredevent.co.uk/wired/agenda&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler''' (25 June 1884 – 11 January 1979) was a German-born art historian, art collector, and one of the most notable [[France|French]] [[art dealer]]s of the 20th century. He became prominent as an art gallery owner in [[Paris]] beginning in 1907 and was among the first champions of [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]] and the [[Cubism|Cubist]] movement in art.&lt;ref name="JR"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=John Richardson (art historian) |first=John |last=Richardson |title=A Life Of Picasso, The Cubist Rebel, 1907-1916 |page=36 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |date= 1991 |isbn=978-0-307-26665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kahnweiler's family moved from [[Rockenhausen]], a small village in the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], to [[Mannheim]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], where Kahnweiler was born in 1884. His upbringing and education at a German [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] prepared him well for his life as an art connoisseur and pragmatic businessman. Early employment in the family business of [[Stockbroker|stock brokerage]] in Germany and Paris gave way to an interest in art collecting while Kahnweiler was still in his twenties. He opened his first small art gallery (4 by 4 meters) in Paris in 1907 at 28 rue Vignon. There was a family precedent for such an enterprise, since his uncle, who ran a famous stock brokerage house in [[London]], was a major art collector of traditional English art works and furniture.&lt;ref name="JR" /&gt;

==Art dealer==
[[File:Picasso Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler 1910.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1910, ''[[Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'', oil on canvas, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
Kahnweiler is considered to have been one of the greatest supporters of the [[Cubism|Cubist]] art movement through his activities as an art dealer and spokesman for artists. He was among the first people to recognize the importance and beauty of Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles D'Avignon]]'' and immediately wanted to buy it along with all of Picasso's works. Picasso wrote of Kahnweiler, "What would have become of us if Kahnweiler hadn't had a business sense?" Kahnweiler's appreciation of Picasso's talents was especially gratifying to the artist, since he was largely unknown and destitute at the time when many of his most famous works were created.&lt;ref name="JR" /&gt;

In his gallery, Kahnweiler supported many of the great artists of his time who found themselves without adequate recognition and little or no interest among collectors. Initial purchases included works by [[Kees van Dongen]], [[André Derain]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] and several other artists of the same generation. To use his own word, Kahnweiler wanted to "defend" great artists, but only those who had no dealers and whose talents he was convinced of. Rather than exhibiting appealing works by established artists from the past and present, Kahnweiler championed burgeoning artists who had come from all over the globe to live and work in [[Montparnasse]] and [[Montmartre]] at the time. Thus [[Paul Cézanne]], although a great artist, was considered too old to be represented, and his work was already represented by the dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]] in any case.&lt;ref name= "JR" /&gt;

[[File:Kees van Dongen, c.1907-08, Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, oil on canvas, 65 x 54 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Kees van Dongen]], c.1907-08, ''Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler'', oil on canvas, Musée du Petit Palais, Geneva]]
Along with such men as [[Alfred Flechtheim]], [[Paul Cassirer]], [[Daniel Wildenstein]], [[Léonce Rosenberg]] and [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], Kahnweiler was one of the influential art connoisseurs of the 20th century. As a businessman, Kahnweiler pioneered many new methods of working with artists and art dealing; these are now established practices in the industry.

In 1907, when there were only half a dozen viable galleries in Paris, he made contracts with artists to buy all of their work in order to free them from financial worries and permit them to concentrate on their creative work. He met with them daily to discuss their work, photographed each work they produced (he felt it imperative to have a record), held exhibitions of their work and promoted their work internationally. Since he considered himself friends with many of them, he co-owned little sailing boats with his artists.

As part of his activities in promoting the work of emerging artists, Kahnweiler sponsored the first exhibition of the work of [[Georges Braque]]. He encouraged the practice of publishing ''Beaux Livres'' (beautiful books), in which a contemporary artist would illustrate a work of a contemporary writer. He expanded his presentations by bringing together artists, writers and poets to produce their works as a joint project in more than 40 books. Picasso, for example, illustrated the works of [[Max Jacob]]. As a publisher of art with literary works, he had no equal, and was the first to sponsor publications by Max Jacob, [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[André Masson]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and many others. In doing so, he launched many literary careers.

Kahnweiler's entrepreneurial abilities were so acute that by the 1950s his art gallery was in the top 100 companies in France in terms of turnover from export.

==Art history==
Although the financial support for artists was an important contribution to art history, he was also a significant figure for his work as an art historian and eyewitness to the emergence of Cubism during the period 1907–1914. When working in Paris, his spare time was devoted to reading and understanding the [[history of art]] and [[aesthetics]]. He also spent his time visiting the city's museums and art galleries. Besides the museums in Paris, he took trips around the European continent to see what was being shown in museums and art galleries outside France. He gave his first interview on Cubism in 1912, and it was actual historical events that led to his career as a historian. There is a view that Kahnweiler's sensibility was such that his gallery, and the way he styled and developed it, was as much a Cubist gallery as were the paintings by Picasso and the other Cubist painters. The gallery had a clear [[aesthetic]] position, uncompromising integrity, financial stability and creative development. During the years 1907-1914 his gallery was a central cradle for Cubism, not only to see the works but where one also met the artists, discussed art and where artists discussed each other's works.

Concurrently, the primary means for avant-garde painters and sculptors to show their works to a wider audience remained the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] and the [[Salon d'Automne]]. Kahnweiler forbade his 'gallery Cubists' from exhibiting at these major Salons,&lt;ref name="Taylor, 2010"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aN9MriMKsE Michael Taylor, 2010, Philadelphia Museum of Art, ''Modern and Contemporary'' 439, Metzinger - ''Tea Time'' (''Woman with a Teaspoon''), 1 Audio Stop 439, Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt; and by doing so actually removed them from the public view. For the general public, Cubism was more associated with the 'Salon Cubists', such as [[Jean Metzinger]],&lt;ref name="Taylor, 2010" /&gt; [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Francis Picabia]].&lt;ref name="Edwards, Wood"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=TU0KwJuBvAsC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=kahnweiler+gallery+cubists+vs+salon+cubists&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH2On2m9zTAhUH8RQKHfhJDpwQ6AEINDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=kahnweiler%20gallery%20cubists%20vs%20salon%20cubists&amp;f=false Steve Edwards, Paul Wood, ''Art of the Avant-gardes''], Yale University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0300102305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I and World War II==
[[File:Juan Gris Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler 1921.jpg|thumb|right|Pencil drawing of Kahnweiler by [[Juan Gris]], 1921, [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], Paris]]
The outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 not only ruptured the Cubist experiments in art, but also forced Kahnweiler to live in exile in [[Switzerland]]; due to his German citizenship, he was considered an [[Alien (law)|alien]] under French law. Many German nationals living in France had their possessions sequestered by the French state, and as a result, Kahnweiler's collection was confiscated in 1914 and sold by the government in a series of auctions at the [[Hôtel Drouot]] between 1921 and 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Gee, Dealers, Critics and Collectors of Modern Painting; Aspects of the Parisian Art Market Between 1910 and 1930, Courtauld PhD Dissertation 1977, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15324coll18/id/45980 Kahnweiler collection: Catalogue des tableaux, aquarelles, gouaches et dessins. Part II,  Hôtel Drouot, Paris, November 17-18, 1921]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years of exile (until 1920), Kahnweiler studied and wrote works such as the ''Der Weg Zum Kubismus'' and ''Confessions esthétiques''. Writing becoming a passion he continued over his lifetime, and he authored hundreds of books and major articles. The second period of enforced writing came during a period of internal exile caused by the events of [[World War II]].  As a [[Jew]], the [[Nazi]]s forced him to flee Paris. He remained in France in hiding. "Under the clouds from the [[gas chamber]]s," as he put it, he wrote his seminal work on [[Juan Gris]].

==At the end==
Kahnweiler was very prolific as an author, but never produced a full autobiography. There was, however, a series of interviews first aired on French television, then published and translated as a book under the title ''Mes galleries et mes peintres'' ("my galleries and my painters". For his 80th birthday, a ''[[Festschrift]]'' was published with contributions by the world's leading philosophers, art historians, and artists, all of whom emphasized the vital importance of his unique contribution to art history – an importance still not yet fully appreciated, probably due to the fact that he has been viewed mostly as an art dealer and not as an [[art historian]]. This situation has been aggravated because some of his major works on [[aesthetics]] were either never translated into English or badly translated. The omission of key elements of a proper understanding of Cubism and focus on small and sensational elements of his complex relationship with Picasso has led to a flawed understanding of the ideas he put forward in these writings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Although revered by artists for his business and aesthetic sense and respected by art dealers and art historians, the true impact of his life and work has yet to be recognized, despite a recent biography by [[Pierre Assouline]]. He died in 1979 in Paris aged 94.

Gazin-Schwartz, &amp; Smith, A. (ed.). ''Landscapes of clearance: archaeological and anthorpological perspectives'', pp. 87-111. University of Arizona: Left Coast.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The engravings==
There are more than 3500 individual engravings at this site, predominantly pecked geometric images, occur on glaciated basement rock exposed in the bed of the river and are submerged when the river rises. Archaeologists and geomorphologists have estimated that the engravings may have been made in two episodes – before about 2500 years ago and after about 1000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. 2002. ''Driekopseiland and 'the rain's magic power': history and landscape in a new interpretation of a Northern Cape rock engraving site''. MA dissertation, University of the Western Cape.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==
The site has been at the centre of a number of debates about South African rock engravings.

Sensational claims about the site and makers of the engravings are advanced by Brenda Sullivan, Cyril Hromnik and others in books such as ''Spirit of the rocks''.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, B. 1995. ''Spirit of the Rocks''. Pretoria: Human &amp; Rousseau; Mutwa, C. 1996. ''Song of the Stars: the Lore of a Zulu Shaman''. New York: Station Hill Openings, Barrytown Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ideas set out by these authors, often involving ancient visitors from foreign lands, and alleged links between the engravings and Ogham inscriptions, are rejected by archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.driekopseiland.itgo.com/catalog.html Off-beat conjectures at Driekops Eiland]; Morris, D., Steyn, M., &amp; Ribot, I. 2006. A burial from Driekopseiland, Northern Cape. ''South African Archaeological Bulletin'' 61: 133-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the archaeological fraternity the site has become important in collegial debates on authorship of rock art in Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. 2002. ''Driekopseiland and 'the rain's magic power': history and landscape in a new interpretation of a Northern Cape rock engraving site''. MA dissertation, University of the Western Cape; Smith, B. W., &amp; Ouzman, S. 2004. Taking stock: identifying Khoekhoen Herder rock art in southern Africa. ''Current Anthropology'' 45: 499-526.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst rock art specialists there are two principal ideas concerning Driekops Eiland. One of them suggests that whereas sites such as the nearby [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|Wildebeest Kuil]], with its profusion of engravings of animals and some human figures, is quintessentially [[Bushmen|San]]/hunter-gatherer in character, the site of Driekops Eiland, with its massive preponderance of geometric engravings and very few animals and hardly any human figures, most likely belongs to a different tradition of rock art, now believed to be a separate [[Khoekhoe]] herder rock art tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, B. W., &amp; Ouzman, S. 2004. Taking stock: identifying Khoekhoen Herder rock art in southern Africa. ''Current Anthropology'' 45: 499-526.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been a persuasive argument, and the distribution of sites with geometric rock art appears to match the hypothesised migration routes by which herders are thought to have spread through South Africa about 2000 years ago. 

A different perspective on Driekops Eiland &lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. 2002. ''Driekopseiland and 'the rain's magic power': history and landscape in a new interpretation of a Northern Cape rock engraving site''. MA dissertation, University of the Western Cape.&lt;/ref&gt; does not discount this possibility, that different identity groups have given rise to some of the variability between sites,&lt;ref&gt;Parkington, J., Morris, D. &amp; Rusch, N. 2008. ''Karoo rock engravings''. Clanwilliam: Krakadouw Trust&lt;/ref&gt; but questions whether assigning variability in terms of ethnic or cultural differences in the first instance does not perhaps overlook degrees of complexity and other possible factors. This approach draws on archaeological sources, ethnographic clues, and palaeoenvironmental data to suggest that the environmental setting of the site was a locus of particular cultural and social significance. Ethnographic accounts, including those with reference to the social significance of water, show how features in the landscape could be imbued with meaning.  Places and rock faces could become meaningful supports, mediating spirit worlds, the surfaces bearing the rock art images being a “most fundamental part of the context”.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis-Williams, J. D., &amp; Dowson, T.A. 1990. Through the veil: San rock paintings and the rock face. ''South African Archaeological Bulletin'' 45: 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The engravings as residues of ritual practices===
Ethnographic sources, moreover, refer to [[ritual]] practices, specifically the female [[Rite of passage|puberty rites]], which have (or had) a specific geographical focus at the water source. Facial or body marking, and sometimes the daubing of objects, with ochre, scarification, and other modes, was a widely consistent feature of the ceremonies of reintroduction that concluded the rites (the literature is vast, from across the Khoe-San spectrum&lt;ref&gt;From the /Xam [San] context: Bleek, D. F. 1933. Beliefs and customs of the |Xam Bushmen. Part V. The rain. ''Bantu Studies'' 7: 297-312 &amp;  Hewitt, R. L. 1986. Structure, meaning and ritual in the narratives of the Southern San. ''Quellen zur Khoisan Forschung'' (Hamburg: Helmut Buske Verlag) 2: 1-305; For a Nama [Khoekhoe] example: Hoernlé, A. W. 1918. Certain rites of transition and the conception of !nau among the Hottentots. ''Harvard African Studies'' 2: 65-82.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In Khoe-San ethnography, the spirit worlds over and under the earth are mediated by water in the form of rain and the waterhole&lt;ref&gt;Lewis-Williams, J. D. 1996. 'A visit to the Lion's House': the structures, metaphors and socio political significance of a nineteenth century Bushman myth. In J. Deacon, &amp; Dowson, T.A. (ed.). ''Voices from the past: |Xam Bushman and the Bleek and Lloyd collection'', pp. 122-141. Johannesburg: Witwatersrand University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. 2002. ''Driekopseiland and 'the rain's magic power': history and landscape in a new interpretation of a Northern Cape rock engraving site''. MA dissertation, University of the Western Cape.&lt;/ref&gt; that the hypothesized ritual practices and the rich field of social meanings in Khoe-San beliefs in relation to !''Khwa'', the rain/water (or its manifestation as a mythical ‘watersnake’), and the initiate, referred to as the ‘new maiden’, can be conceived as converging in the nearly palpable power of place at Driekops Eiland – where glacially smoothed basement rock, aligned with the flow of the river, ‘bulges’ and ‘dips’, snake-like, above or below the water according to the season. The site resonates with environmental rhythms, and these, in turn, were very likely resources for cultural construal. Upon this great, smooth, undulating surface (itself perhaps construed as a giant, fecund ‘watersnake’ – associated with rivers in many tales), more than 3,500 rock engravings are densely placed, such that they become submerged when the rains come in the wet season, but equally are left high and dry when river flow dwindles, or ceases altogether.

As  a powerful place, it is possible that Driekops Eiland became – in this view – a focus in rites, perhaps specifically those associated with the ‘new maiden’, who represented “the rain’s magic power” (according to ≠Kamme-an, Dia!kwain’s mother&lt;ref&gt;Lewis-Williams, J. D. 2000. ''Stories that float from afar: ancestral folklore of the San of Southern Africa.'' Cape Town: David Philip.&lt;/ref&gt;); that the place itself was an active element in these rites in the redefinition of social personhood; and that the power of the place was enhanced in particular periods in its history (perhaps periods of ritual intensification in response to environmental and/or social stress) by marking with engravings, which themselves may be a residue of ritual sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. 2002. ''Driekopseiland and 'the rain's magic power': history and landscape in a new interpretation of a Northern Cape rock engraving site''. MA dissertation, University of the Western Cape.&lt;/ref&gt;  These rituals are or were practised with great emotional and symbolic intensity. 

It is suggested&lt;ref&gt;Morris, D. 2002. ''Driekopseiland and 'the rain's magic power': history and landscape in a new interpretation of a Northern Cape rock engraving site''. MA dissertation, University of the Western Cape.&lt;/ref&gt; that a metaphorical understanding of place – and the possibility that different parts of the landscape might vary in ritual significance (hilltops very likely being associated with rain-making rites) – may be factors more germane to the questions of variability in the rock art of the region than appeals primarily to ethnicity and cultural difference.

==Formal protection==
Driekops Eiland was declared a National Monument in 1944. It automatically became a Grade 2 Provincial Heritage Site when the National Heritage Resources Act (Act 25 of 1999) was promulgated.

==Detrimental impacts==
A weir was built across the upper part of the site in 1942, causing permanent submergence of an estimated 150 engravings above the weir, and changing flood dynamics and silt accumulation patterns. The latter triggered, in turn, increased reed growth and an invasion of eucalyptus saplings across silted parts of the site - helped along by increased flow after a canal was built from the [[Orange River]] to the [[Kalfontein Dam]] (on the Riet River) in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Appendix in Morris, D. 2002.

'''''Drowning Girl''''' (also known as '''''Secret Hearts''''' or '''''I Don't Care! I'd Rather Sink''''') is a 1963 painting in oil and synthetic polymer paint on canvas by [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. Using the conventions of [[comic book]] art, a [[speech balloon|thought bubble]] conveys the thoughts of the figure, while [[Ben-Day dots]] echo the effect of the mechanized printing process. It is one of the most representative paintings of the [[pop art]] movement, and part of the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s permanent collection since 1971. The painting is considered among Lichtenstein's most significant works, perhaps on a par with his acclaimed 1963 diptych ''[[Whaam!]]''. ''Drowning Girl'' has been described as a "masterpiece of melodrama", and is one of the artist's earliest images depicting women in tragic situations, a theme to which he often returned in the mid-1960s.

The painting shows a teary-eyed woman on a turbulent sea. She is emotionally distressed, seemingly from a romance. A thought bubble reads: "I Don't Care! I'd Rather Sink&amp;nbsp;— Than Call Brad For Help!" This narrative element highlights the clichéd [[melodrama]], while its graphics reiterate Lichtenstein's theme of [[painterly]] work imitating mechanized reproduction. The work is derived from a 1962 [[DC Comics]] panel, while also borrowing from [[Hokusai]]'s ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'' and from elements of modernist artists [[Jean Arp]] and [[Joan Miró]]. It is one of several Lichtenstein works that mention a character named Brad who is absent from the picture. Both the graphical and narrative elements of the work are cropped from the source image.

==Background==

During the late 1950s and early 1960s a number of American painters began to adapt the imagery and motifs of comic strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Art Movements|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/modern-art-movements.htm|publisher=ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ART|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Lichtenstein]] made drawings of comic strip characters in 1958. [[Andy Warhol]] produced his earliest paintings in the style in 1960. Lichtenstein, unaware of Warhol's work, produced ''[[Look Mickey]]'' and ''Popeye'' in 1961.&lt;ref name=L72&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: A Continuing History| last =Livingstone | first = Marco | publisher =[[Thames and Hudson]]|isbn=0-500-28240-4|year=2000|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Warhol had produced silkscreens of [[comic strips]] and of other [[pop art]] subjects, he supposedly relegated himself to ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' as a subject at the time to avoid competing with the more finished style of comics by Lichtenstein.&lt;ref name="W109"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bourdon, David|title=Warhol|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams, Inc. Publishing]]|year=1989|isbn=0-8109-1761-0|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; He once said "I've got to do something that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and [[James Rosenquist]], that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing."&lt;ref name="Wat79"&gt;{{cite book|author=Watson, Steven|title=Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties|publisher=Pantheon Books|isbn= 0-679-42372-9|year=2003|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Drowning Girl'' depicted the advancement of Lichtenstein's cartoon work, which represented his 1961 departure from his [[abstract expressionism]] period, from animated cartoons to more serious themes such as romance and wartime armed forces.&lt;ref name=RLMoMA&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=LG8xJ-LRHJkC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Drowning+Girl%22+Lichtenstein |title=Roy Lichtenstein| last =Lanchner | first = Carolyn | publisher =[[Museum of Modern Art]]|year=2009|isbn=0-87070-770-1|pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein said that, at the time, "I was very excited about, and very interested in, the highly emotional content yet detached impersonal handling of love, hate, war, etc., in these cartoon images."&lt;ref name = RLMoMA /&gt; Lichtenstein parodied four Picassos between 1962 and 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.christies.com/about/press-center/releases/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=6290 |type=Release | title = Roy Lichtenstein's Woman with Flowered Hat: A Pop Art Masterpiece|accessdate = June 7, 2013 |date=April 10, 2013|publisher=[[Christie's]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso's depictions of weeping women may have influenced Lichtenstein to produce portrayals of vulnerable teary-eyed women, such as the subjects of ''[[Hopeless (Roy Lichtenstein)|Hopeless]]'' and ''Drowning Girl''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Classic of the New|editor=Schneider, Eckhard|publisher=[[Kunsthaus Bregenz]]|year=2005|isbn= 3-88375-965-1 | page =142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible influence on his emphasis on depicting distressed women in the early- to mid-1960s was that his first marriage was dissolving at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/kimmelman1.htm |title=Roy Lichtenstein at the Met |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |publisher=Lichtenstein Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627145324/http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/kimmelman1.htm |archivedate=June 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein's first marriage to Isabel Wilson, which resulted in two sons, lasted from 1949 to 1965; the couple separated in 1963.&lt;ref name=PApRLda7/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Q93FYrc_m80C&amp;pg=PA29|title=Pop Artists (Artist in Profile Series) |accessdate=June 17, 2013|year=2002|isbn=1-58810-646-2|page=29| last =Mason | first = Paul|publisher=[[Heinemann Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lichtenstein made his transition to comic-based work, he began to mimic the style while adapting the subject matter. He applied simplified color schemes and commercial printing-like techniques. The style he adopted was "simple, well-framed images {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} solid fields of bold color often bounded by thick, stark border lines."&lt;ref name=TLoC:WaP&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Todd|title=The Language of Comics: Word and Image |year=2001|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=1-57806-414-7|page=42|editor1-last =Varnum | editor1-first = Robin | editor2-last = Gibbons | editor2-first = Christina T.|chapter=Coyotes and Visual Ethos}}&lt;/ref&gt; The borrowed technique was "representing tonal variations with patterns of colored circles that imitated the half-tone screens of Ben-Day dots used in newspaper printing".&lt;ref name=TGEoAA&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sPGdBxzaWj0C&amp;pg=RA2-PA158 |title=The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art| accessdate= June 15, 2013| year =2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-533579-1|page=158| editor-last =Marter | editor-first = Joan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PBS]] asserts that this is an adaptation of the [[ligne claire]] style associated with [[Hergé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.pbs.org/pov/tintinandi/special_tintinamerica.php#.UcDzjtjxGF9 |title=Essay: Tintin in America|accessdate=June 19, 2013| publisher= [[PBS]]|author=Bengal, Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein once said of his technique: "I take a cliche and try to organize its forms to make it monumental."&lt;ref name=PApRLda7&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1997/Pop-Art-pioneer-Roy-Lichtenstein-dead-at-73/id-43b85ac8a5a6ab361d2adb164e6a10ce |title=Pop Art pioneer Roy Lichtenstein dead at 73|accessdate=June 10, 2013|date=September 29, 1997|agency=[[Associated Press]]| last =Monroe | first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of ''Drowning Girl'' is an example of Lichtenstein's post-1963 comics-based women who "look hard, crisp, brittle, and uniformly modish in appearance, as if they all came out of the same pot of makeup."{{Sfn | Coplans | 1972 | p = 23}}  In the early 1960s, Lichtenstein produced several "fantasy drama" paintings of women in love affairs with domineering men causing women to be miserable, such as ''Drowning Girl'', ''Hopeless'' and ''[[In the Car]]''.  These works served as prelude to 1964 paintings of innocent "girls next door" in a variety of tenuous emotional states.&lt;ref name=W113/&gt; "In ''Hopeless'' and ''Drowning Girl'', for example, the heroines appear as victims of unhappy love affairs, with one displaying helplessness&amp;nbsp;... and the other defiance (she would rather drown than ask for her lover's help)."&lt;ref name=W113/&gt; ''Drowning Girl'', the aforementioned works and ''[[Oh, Jeff...I Love You, Too...But...]]'' are among those tragedies that make the author a popular draw at museums.&lt;ref name=RLARatNGoAWD&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gaithersburg.patch.com/blog_posts/roy-lichtenstein-a-retrospective-at-the-national-gallery-of-art-washington-dc |title=Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=December 11, 2012|work=[[Gaithersburg Patch]]| last =Borchert | first = Vian Shamounki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Drowning Girl'' is derived from the [[splash page (comics)|splash page]] from "Run for Love!", illustrated by Tony Abruzzo and lettered by [[Ira Schnapp]], in ''Secret Hearts'' #83 (November 1962), [[DC Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| artist=Tony Abruzzo|letterer=Ira Schnapp|story=Run for Love!|title=Secret Hearts | issue=83 | publisher =DC Comics|date=November 1963|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Waldman | 1993 | pp = 118–19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arntson|first=Amy E.|title = Graphic Design Basics |year=2006|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0-495-00693-9|page= 165}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same comic book issue that inspired ''Hopeless''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://image-duplicator.com/sat/sat_source_details.php?source_id=21212|title=Secret Hearts #83 (a)|accessdate= June 11, 2013 | publisher = Lichtenstein Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Lichtenstein was parodying various types of sources such as commercial illustrations, comic imagery and even modern masterpieces. The masterpieces represented what could have been dubbed the "canon" of art and was thought of as "high art," while the "low-art" subject matter included comic strip images. His masterworks sources included the likes of [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]. During this time in his career, Lichtenstein noted that "the things that I have apparently parodied I actually admire."&lt;ref name= CtoaPAm&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=61860#.UbHwPtjxGF8|title=Christie's to offer a Pop Art masterpiece: Roy Lichtenstein's Woman with Flowered Hat|accessdate=June 7, 2013|date=|work=ArtDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Lichtenstein was exploring the theme of "industrialization of emotion". In Lichtenstein's obituary, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic [[Christopher Knight (art critic)|Christopher Knight]] said the work was "a witty rejoinder to [[Willem de Kooning|De Kooning]]'s famously brushy paintings of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1997/sep/30/news/mn-37730/2 |title=Pop Art Icon Lichtenstein Dies|accessdate=June 23, 2013|date=September 30, 1997|work= The [[Los Angeles Times]]| last =Knight | first = Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; His comic romances often depicted stereotypical representations of thwarted passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=J1t8g_yX1wcC&amp;pg=PA289 | title = Of Comics and Men: A Cultural History of American Comic Books|accessdate=June 7, 2013|publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn = 1-60473-267-9 | year =2009|page=289| last =Gabilliet | first = Jean-Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Lichtenstein Foundation website claims that Lichtenstein did not begin using his [[opaque projector]] technique until the fall of 1963,&lt;ref name=C/&gt; Lichtenstein described his process for producing comics based art, including ''Drowning Girl'':

==Description==
Some sources describe the subjects of Lichtenstein's tragic girls series as heroines (in the sense that they are the counterparts to the heroes),&lt;ref name =RLAR@NGoA/&gt; and others do not (in the sense that they are not heroic).&lt;ref name=TGtUSPC&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&amp;pg=PA490|title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture| last =Kongden | first = Kristen| editor1-last = Browne | editor1-first = Ray B | editor2-first = Pat | editor2-last = Browne |publisher=Popular Press 3|isbn=0-87972-821-3|page= 490|year= 2001 | accessdate =June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Drowning Girl'' is a painting of a female subject who would prefer to give in to the power of the ocean than call for aid. Lichtenstein's version of the scene eliminates everything but the sea and a few body parts of the subject: her head, shoulder and hand, which are barely above the water. As her face is presented her eyes are shut with drops of what appear to be tears flowing from them. Because Lichtenstein only presents a single frame, the viewer does not know what happened before this moment and what is going to happen after it.  Furthermore, the viewer has no way to know who Brad is and why she is so reluctant to call him.&lt;ref name=RLAR@NGoA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcist.com/2012/10/roy_lichtenstein_a_retrospective_na.php|title=Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective @ National Gallery of Art|accessdate=June 8, 2013|date=October 11, 2012|last1=Rand|first1=Kelly|first2=Julia|last2=Langley|work=[[DCist]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228085008/http://dcist.com/2012/10/roy_lichtenstein_a_retrospective_na.php|archivedate=February 28, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art'', the most important element of Lichtenstein's procedure in the early 1960s was "the enlargement and unification of his source material".&lt;ref name =TGEoAA /&gt; Although, according to some sources, the changes made to produce ''Drowning Girl'' are not regarded as significant,&lt;ref name=W113&gt;{{Harvnb | Waldman | 1993 | p = 113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein made several notable changes from the original source: "In the original illustration, the drowning girl's boyfriend appears in the background, clinging to a capsized boat. Lichtenstein cropped the image dramatically, showing the girl alone and encircled by a threatening wave. He changed the caption from 'I don't care if I have a cramp!' to 'I don't care!' and the boyfriend's name from Mal to Brad."&lt;ref name=MOMA&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A3542&amp;page_number=3&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 |title=''Drowning Girl'': Roy Lichtenstein (American, 1923–1997) |accessdate=May 23, 2012|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the former narrative change, Lichtenstein removed evidence that the drowning girl has a cramp in her leg.&lt;ref name=RLAR@NGoA/&gt; With the latter narrative change, Lichtenstein attempted to change the perception of the boyfriend. When discussing another work (''[[I Know...Brad]]''), Lichtenstein stated that the name Brad sounded heroic to him and was used with the aim of clichéd oversimplification.{{Sfn | Coplans | 1972 | p = 110}}

Lichtenstein's method entailed "strengthening of the formal aspects of the composition, a stylization of motif, and a 'freezing' of both emotion and actions".&lt;ref name =TGEoAA /&gt; Although comic-book panels depict a moment in time, ''Drowning Girl'' is borrowed from an example of a comic-book panel depiction of a moment relatively more "pregnant" with past- and future-dependent drama than most moments.&lt;ref name=PoR&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lFxCRvrm9zAC&amp;pg=PA156 |title=Pictures of Romance: Form against Context in Painting and Literature|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]| last = Steiner | first = Wendy|isbn=0-226-77229-2|year=1987|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work also marks a phase in Lichtenstein's career when many of his works were given [[present participle|present-participial]] titles such as ''[[Sleeping Girl]]'', ''[[Crying Girl]]'' and ''Blonde Waiting'', which accentuates the works' "relation to process and action."&lt;ref name=PoR/&gt; According to ''The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art'', during this phase of Lichtenstein's career "a constant if restrained and a gentle sense of humor contribute just as much to the cheerful lightness of Lichtenstein's work as the balanced, completely harmonious composition."&lt;ref name=TGEoAA /&gt;

[[File:Roy Lichtenstein Drowning Girl narrative.jpg|left|thumb|Narrative content of ''Drowning Girl'']]
Narrative content was in the forefront of much of Lichtenstein's work as a means to engage the viewer.&lt;ref name=RLDW63&gt;{{Harvnb | Waldman | 1993 | p = 63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Measuring 171.6&amp;nbsp;cm × 169.5&amp;nbsp;cm (67.625 in × 66.75 in), ''Drowning Girl'' presents "a young woman who seems to have cried herself a river&amp;nbsp;... literally drowning in emotion," according to Janis Hendrickson. The [[melodrama]] makes it clear that she has been hurt by a "Brad", the name given to several of Lichtenstein's heroes.&lt;ref name=RLJH34a&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein| last =Hendrickson | first = Janis|publisher = [[Benedikt Taschen]]|year=1993|isbn=3-8228-9633-0|page=34|chapter=The Pictures That Lichtenstein Made Famous, or The Pictures That Made Lichtenstein Famous|quote=The ''Drowning Girl'' (Ill. p. 31) (1963) shows a young woman who seems to have cried herself a river. She is literally drowning in emotion and has abandoned herself to its destructive forces. Brad, the name of the man involved with several of Lichtenstein's "heroines", must have hurt her badly.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vian Shamounki Borchert says that the caption makes it clear that the subject is practically "drowning in a sea of tears".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gaithersburg.patch.com/blog_posts/roy-lichtenstein-a-retrospective-at-the-national-gallery-of-art-washington-dc|title=Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=December 11, 2012|work=[[Gaithersburg Patch]]| last =Borchert | first = Vian Shamounki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In typical Lichtenstein fashion, the tragic female is presented "in a suspended state of distress."&lt;ref name=RLAR@NGoA/&gt; According to Janis Hendrickson, the subject's head appears to rest on a wave as if it were a pillow and lies in the water as if it were a bed, creating a blend of "eroticism and final resting place".&lt;ref name=RLJH34b&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein| last =Hendrickson | first = Janis|publisher = [[Benedikt Taschen]]|year=1993|isbn=3-8228-9633-0|page=34|chapter=The Pictures That Lichtenstein Made Famous, or The Pictures That Made Lichtenstein Famous|quote=She is lying in the water as if it were a bed, a mixture of eroticism and final resting place.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waters of the sea swirl around the subject's waves of hair creating the perception of a whirlpool.&lt;ref name=RLAR@NGoA/&gt; The painting is representative of Lichtenstein's affinity for single-frame drama that reduces the viewer's ability to identify with it and that abstracts emotion. His use of industrial and mechanical appearance further trivialize the sentiments,&lt;ref name=RLJH34/&gt; although the painterly touches add to its simplification.&lt;ref name=DftM /&gt;

==General context==
In the early 1960s Lichtenstein's theme of comics-based work was hotly debated. In a 1963 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, [[Brian O'Doherty]] wrote that Lichtenstein's work was not art, saying Lichtenstein was "one of the worst artists in America" who "briskly went about making a sow's ear out of a sow's ear."&lt;ref name=PApRLda7/&gt; This was part of a widespread debate about the merits of Lichtenstein's comic blow-ups as true art. In January 1964 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' ran a story under the title "Is He the Worst Artist in the U.S.?" on this controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/lifemagroy.htm |title=Is He the Worst Artist in the U.S.? |accessdate=June 10, 2013 |date=January 31, 1964 |work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |publisher=Lichtenstein Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104111859/http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/lifemagroy.htm |archivedate=November 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later reviews were much kinder. [[Todd Brewster]] noted that this may have been motivated by popular demand; he told ''Life'' in 1986 that "Those cartoon blowups may have disturbed the critics, but collectors, tired of the solemnity of abstract expressionism, were ready for some comic relief. Why couldn't the funny pages be fine art?"&lt;ref name = PApRLda7 /&gt; His work is now widely accepted, although some criticize him for borrowing from comics without attributing the original creators, paying royalties, or seeking permission from copyright holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2013/may/image-duplicator-pop-arts-comic-theft |title=Image Duplicator: pop art's comic debt |accessdate=June 18, 2013 |date=May 13, 2013 |last=Steven |first=Rachael |work=[[Creative Review]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002013823/http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2013/may/image-duplicator-pop-arts-comic-theft |archivedate=October 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Barsalou has dedicated decades to identifying all of Lichtenstein's source materials and has posted more than 1,000 images on [[Flickr]] detailing Lichtenstein's unrecognized sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/02/02/deconstructing-lichtenstein-source-comics-revealed-and-credited/ |title=Deconstructing Lichtenstein: Source Comics Revealed and Credited |accessdate=June 23, 2013 |date=February 2, 2011 |last=Childs |first=Brian |publisher=Comics Alliance |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112223049/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/02/02/deconstructing-lichtenstein-source-comics-revealed-and-credited/ |archivedate=January 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics question Lichtenstein's artistic skills. [[Everett Kinstler]] said that despite Lichtenstein's association with romance comics, in his day "no comics publisher would have hired Lichtenstein—he wasn't good enough." Kinstler said Lichtenstein lacked the ability to portray the emotional range of the story through facial expressions and body language independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4dWeMZLTXScC&amp;pg=PA163|title=The Ten-Cent Plague: The Great Comic-Book Scare and How It Changed America|accessdate=July 2, 2013|year=2009|author=Hajdu, David|isbn=978-0-312-42823-5 |publisher=[[Picador (imprint)|Picador]]|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Drowning Girl'' was part of the largest ever retrospective of Lichtenstein that visited the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] from May 16 to September 3, 2012, the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from October 14, 2012 to January 13, 2013, the [[Tate Modern]] in London from February 21 to May 27, 2013 and [[The Centre Pompidou]] from July 3 to November 4, 2013.&lt;ref name="Kirkova, Deni"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/22/roy-lichtenstein_n_1533997.html |title='Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective' Debuts At The Art Institute of Chicago | type = photograms |accessdate=June 8, 2013|date=May 22, 2012|work=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2012–13 retrospective, ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' described ''Drowning Girl'' as Lichtenstein's "masterpiece of melodrama".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/02/18/roy-lichtenstein-retrospective-at-tate-modern-review_n_2710865.html |title= Roy Lichtenstein: Retrospective At Tate Modern (Review) | accessdate =June 6, 2013|date=February 18, 2012|work=[[The Huffington Post]]| last =Parker | first = Sam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danish art critic and [[Louisiana Museum of Modern Art]] director [[Poul Erik Tøjner]] called the work an example of Lichtenstein's "post-[[coital]] perdition" pieces, describing it as the "star witness" of this genre of his works. He notes that the subject is reaching far-flung depths as she acts out of pride.&lt;ref name=RLAAA19&gt;{{Harvnb | Holm | Tøjner | Caiger-Smith | 2003 | p = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tøjner perceived eroticism in this painting, likening the open mouth to a vaginal feature and noting the singularity of Lichtenstein using an open mouth. With that in mind, he compares the tears to [[ejaculate]] residue.&lt;ref name=RLAAA21&gt;{{Harvnb | Holm | Tøjner | Caiger-Smith | 2003 | p = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|thumb|Lichtenstein acknowledges that the wave is adapted from [[Hokusai]]'s famous print, ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]''.&lt;ref name=RLJH34 /&gt;]]
This was painted at the apex of Lichtenstein's use of enlarged dots, cropping and magnification of the original source.{{Sfn | Rondeau | Wagstaff | 2012 | p = 32}}  [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] curator Diane Waldman notes that Lichtenstein made ''Drowning Girl'' a cornerstone of his career because of "his extraordinary sense of organization, his ability to use a sweeping curve and manipulate it into an allover pattern".&lt;ref name=RLDW75&gt;{{Harvnb | Waldman | 1993 | p = 75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists'', the work is "a mix of cliché, melodrama, pathos, and absurdity&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Oxford Dictionary of American Art and Artists|page= 282|isbn = 978-0-19-512878-9 |year=2007| last =Morgan | first = Ann Lee|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is described by art scholar Jonathan Fineberg as "a remarkably impassive style".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Art Since 1940: Strategies of Being| last =Fineberg | first = Jonathan|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams]] | isbn = 0-8109-1951-6|year=1995|page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image is typical of Lichtenstein's depiction of comic subjects responding to a situation in a clichéd manner.{{Sfn | Coplans | 1972 | p = 15}}

Lichtenstein's tinkering with the source material resulted in a recomposition with sharper focus after he eliminated several elements that distract from the depiction of the woman, such as the [[capsizing|capsized]] boat, troubled male subject and the general seascape. The result was swirling, swooping waves and "animate white foam" that envelope the subject with a "pictorial buoyancy" that form an "aquatic continuum".&lt;ref name=RLMoMA /&gt;

''Drowning Girl'' presents an "unmistakeable acknowledgement to the flamboyant linearism of [[Art Nouveau]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Illustrated History of Pop Art| last =Pierre | first = José|publisher=Eyre Methuen|isbn=0-413-38370-9|page=94|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waves are intended to "recall [[Hokusai]] as well as the biomorphic forms of [[Jean Arp|Arp]] and [[Joan Miró|Miró]];"{{Sfn | Coplans | 1972 | p = 26}} just as the source comics may have intended to.{{Sfn | Coplans | 1972 | p = 91}}  Lichtenstein has claimed a strong relation between the original comic book source panel and Hokusai's ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', making this work a bridge between the two.{{Sfn | Rondeau | Wagstaff | 2012 | p = 48}}  The adaptation of the wave print is said to add a decorative look and feel to the painting, without which the work might be much more alarming to the viewer.&lt;ref name= RLJH34&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein| last =Hendrickson | first = Janis|publisher=[[Benedikt Taschen]] |year= 1993 | isbn = 3-8228-9633-0 |page=34|chapter = The Pictures That Lichtenstein Made Famous, or The Pictures That Made Lichtenstein Famous}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein even made the connection between ''Drowning Girl'''s arabesque waves and "the Art Nouveau aesthetic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Retro: The Culture of Revival|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2d8J08XNdKEC&amp;pg=PA66 |accessdate=June 6, 2013|publisher=[[Reaktion Books]]| last =Guffey | first = Elizabeth E.|isbn=1-86189-290-X|year= 2006 | pages =66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this work, Lichtenstein stated:
{{Quote |text=In the ''Drowning Girl'' the water is not only Art Nouveau, but it can also be seen as Hokusai. I don't do it just because it is  another reference. Cartooning itself sometimes resembles other periods in art&amp;nbsp;– perhaps unknowingly&amp;nbsp;... They do things like the little Hokusai waves in the ''Drowning Girl''. But the original wasn't very clear in this regard&amp;nbsp;– why should it be? I saw it and then pushed it a little further until it was a reference that most people will get&amp;nbsp;... it is a way of crystallizing the style by exaggeration.|sign=Sources|source=&lt;ref name = RLDW75 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: A Critical History|editor-last =Madoff | editor-first = Steven Henry|isbn=0-520-21018-2|page= 202| year = 1997 | publisher =[[University of California Press]]|chapter=Focus: The Major Artists}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tøjner describes the work as "Lichtenstein's finest formulation of a counter-image to the many explosions in his universe", noting that the drama is past its peak although it may seem to be at a crescendo.&lt;ref name=RLAAA19/&gt; He also notes that "the tears are drawn with classic Lichtenstein waxy fullness" despite the surrounding water, which must be significant since "naturalistic justification" is absent.&lt;ref name=RLAAA19/&gt; A November 1963 ''Art Magazine'' review stated that this was one of the "broad and powerful paintings" of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery.&lt;ref name=RLOF4/&gt; Nonetheless, the name of the work was not universally known.  In a December 1964 ''Art Magazine'' review of his October 24&amp;nbsp;– September 19, 1964 Castelli Gallery show, Lichtenstein was referred to as the author of ''I Don't Care, I'd Rather Sink'' (''Drowning Girl'').&lt;ref name=RLOF4/&gt; According to Gary Garrels of the Museum of Modern Art, the work is a "poetics of the utterly banal, of displaced ordinariness" resulting in an "image frozen in time and space", making it "iconic".&lt;ref name =DftM&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aFikE_v1OJIC&amp;pg=PA28 |title = Drawing from the Modern: 1945–1975|volume=2|page=28|accessdate = June 6, 2013 |year=2005|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]| last =Garrels | first = Gary|isbn=0-87070-664-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing this to the source, Garrels says it is a rendering "in a simplified vocabulary" produced while Lichtenstein put aside his mechanical objectivity.&lt;ref name=DftM /&gt; According to ''The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art'', extreme examples of his formalization become "virtual abstraction" when the viewer recalls that the motif is an element of a larger work. Thus, Lichtenstein reinforced a non-realist view of comic strips and advertisements, presenting them as artificial images with minimalistic graphic techniques. Lichtenstein's magnification of his source material stressed the plainness of his motifs as an equivalent to mechanical commercial drawing, leading to implications about his statements on modern industrial America. Nonetheless, Lichtenstein appears to have accepted the American capitalist industrial culture.&lt;ref name =TGEoAA /&gt;

Lanchner wrote of how Lichtenstein's translation of a "highly charged" content with coolly handled presentation intensified the contrast between the two.&lt;ref name=RLMoMA/&gt; While contrasting Lichtenstein's [[Ben-Day dots]] use in ''Drowning Girl'' with another artist's work, Sarah Rich and Joyce Henri Robinson note that the work "satirizes the melodrama of soap operas and serial comics, turning the drama of the title figure's potential suicide into a high camp performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmkJe9li2BgC&amp;pg=PA13|title=Through the Looking Glass: Women and Self-Representation in Contemporary Art|accessdate = June 7, 2013 |publisher=[[Palmer Museum of Art]]|year=2003| last1 =Rich | first1 = Sarah | first2 = Joyce Henri | last2 = Robinson|isbn = 0-911209-60-3 | page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parepa-Rosa, Euphrosyne, 1836-1874.jpg|upright|thumb|Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa]]
'''Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa''' (7 May 1836 – 21 January 1874) was a British [[opera]]tic [[soprano]] who established the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] together with her husband [[Carl Rosa]]. Parepa's [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|aristocratic father]] died soon after her birth, and her mother turned to the stage to support them. Parepa made her operatic debut in 1855, at age 16, and soon earned enthusiastic reviews in the major London opera houses. In 1867, the widowed Parosa married the violinist and conductor Carl Rosa in New York and founded an opera company with Parepa as the leading lady; they toured successfully in America for several years. After their return to Britain with ambitious plans for their opera company, Parepa fell ill and died in 1874 at only 37 years of age.

==Early life and career==
[[File:Parepasculpture.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Bust of Parepa-Rosa at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]]]
Euphrosyne Parepa was born in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, to the [[soprano]] Elisabeth Seguin (b. 1812, sister of [[Bass (voice type)|basso]] Arthur Edward Seguin) and the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|Wallachian boyar]] Demetrius Parepa, Baron Georgiades de Boyescu of [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name=Illustrated&gt;"Madame Parepa-Rosa", ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 7 February 1874, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Her father died when Parepa was an infant, leaving her young mother impoverished. Parepa's mother turned to the stage to support her child and herself and trained the girl in singing.&lt;ref name=NYtimesobit&gt;{{citation|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07EFDB173BEF34BC4B51DFB766838F669FDE|title=Obituary: Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=23 January 1874|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her operatic début was in 1855 at the age of 16 in [[Malta]] as Amina in ''[[La Sonnambula]]'', followed by engagements in Italy, Spain and Portugal. She gave her first London performance at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], in the role of Elvira in ''[[I Puritani]]'', with the [[Royal Italian Opera]] company, with whom she spent the 1857 season.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Rosenthal, Harold and Elizabeth Forbes. [https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.20896 "Parepa(-Rosa), Euphrosyne (De Boyescu, Parepa)"], Grove Music Online, 20 January 2001, accessed 22 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Italian Opera company held their 1856–57 season at the Lyceum because the [[Royal Opera House]] was being remodeled after a fire. See Obituary: "Madame Parepa Rosa", ''[[The Times]]'', 23 January 1874, p.&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/ref&gt; The critic of ''[[The Observer]]'' wrote of this introduction: "Parepa possesses a soprano voice of excellent quality and remarkable compass. She acts and sings well. Her version of "''Son vergine vezzosa''" elicited applause terminating in a recall, and … [after the ''finale''] she was again called for. … '''"Qui la voce"''' … was correctly and brilliantly executed; and the ''artiste'' was again summoned back to the stage to receive the homage of the audience."&lt;ref&gt;"Royal Italian Opera: First Appearance of Mdlle. Parepa", ''[[The Observer]]'', 25 May 1857, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1859 to 1865, she appeared in opera at both [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]] and at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], becoming known for such roles as Leonora in ''[[Il trovatore]]'', Zerlina in ''[[Fra Diavolo]]'' and Elvira in ''[[La muette de Portici]]''.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; During this time, she participated in two operatic premieres, creating the title role in [[Alfred Mellon]]'s ''Victorine'' in 1859 and the role of Mabel in [[George Alexander Macfarren]]'s opera ''Helvellyn'' in 1864. She also was a successful [[oratorio]] and concert soloist, in constant demand in Britain and beyond.&lt;ref name=NYtimesobit/&gt; She sang with [[Charles Santley]] at the opening of the [[Oxford Music Hall]] in 1861, appeared before the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]] in [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s ''[[Paradise and the Peri]]'' and participated in the 19th-century English revival of the music of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], performing at the Handel festivals of 1862 and 1865, and in Germany.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Elkin. ''Royal Philharmonic'', Ryder: London (1946), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages and later years==
Her first husband, Army Captain H. de Wolfe Carvelle, died in Peru in 1865, sixteen months after their wedding.&lt;ref name=NYtimesobit/&gt; She travelled to the United States in 1865 with cornetist Levy and violinist [[Carl Rosa]], the latter of whom she married in New York City in 1867.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; Together they quickly established the Parepa-Rosa English Opera Company there, featuring her as the leading soprano, which became popular, and which introduced opera to places in America that had never staged it before. They opened at the [[Fourteenth Street Theatre|French Theatre on Fourteenth Street]], New York City, in September 1869 with a performance of [[Michael William Balfe|Balfe]]'s opera ''The Puritan's Daughter'', with Parepa singing the title role. The subsequent tour of the eastern and midwestern states included a repertoire that ranged from ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'' and ''[[Maritana]]'' to Weber's ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' and ''Oberon''.&lt;ref name=Carl&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.carlrosaopera.co.uk/history/uk-ushistory.asp|title=The Carl Rosa Opera Company: American and British History|publisher=Carl Rosa Company Ltd|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, the Parepa-Rosa Opera Company returned to Britain and then appeared in Italian opera at [[Cairo]], Egypt, followed by a return to America for another successful tour in 1871–72.&lt;ref name=Carl/&gt; In 1872, Parepa sang at the [[Lower Rhine Festival]] in [[Düsseldorf]], and they then returned to London, where she sang Donna Anna in ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and the title role in ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' at the Royal Opera House.&lt;ref name=Illustrated/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt; In September 1873, the company changed its name to [[Carl Rosa Opera Company|Carl Rosa's English Opera]], since Parepa was pregnant.&lt;ref name=Carl/&gt;

Parepa died in London, after an illness, at the age of 37 while preparing to sing Elsa in an English version of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' as part of her husband's planned season a [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]]; after her death, Rosa cancelled the season.&lt;ref name=Illustrated/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: "Madame Parepa Rosa", ''The Times'', 23 January 1874, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; She is buried at [[Highgate cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Legge, R. H., revised by J. Gilliland. [https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/21264 "Rosa, Euphrosyne Parepa (''née'' Euphrosyne Parepa de Boyesku or Boyescu)"], ''Oxford [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', 23 September 2004, accessed 22 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; After her death, Rosa endowed the Parepa-Rosa Scholarship at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in her memory.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;

==Reputation==
William Winter wrote that "Great vocal powers have seldom found such ample or such touching expression as those of Parepa-Rosa did in the first act of ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''.  … [O]ne of her best successes was made as Rosina in ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' ... to indicate the versatility of her talents and the scope and thoroughness of her culture."&lt;ref&gt;Winter, William. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lJSYCwf6VaQC&amp;pg=PA253  ''Brief Chronicles''], Ayer Publishing (1970) {{ISBN|0-8337-3826-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her obituary in ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' stated: "Her voice was a genuine soprano, of extensive compass and fine quality, while her highly-cultivated execution and her general musical knowledge gave her exceptional advantages, both mechanical and intellectual".&lt;ref name=Illustrated/&gt;

Her achievements were recognised by the [[Royal Philharmonic Society|Philharmonic Society of London]] (now the Royal Philharmonic Society) with the rare award of their Gold Medal in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/awards/gold_medal/goldmedalrecipients/|title=RPS Gold Medal Recipients Since 1870|publisher=Royal Philharmonic Society|accessdate=30 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509113938/http://www.royalphilharmonicsociety.org.uk/awards/gold_medal/goldmedalrecipients/|archivedate=9 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Morland''' (26 June 1763 in [[London]]{{snd}}29 October 1804 in [[Brighton]]) was an English [[Painting|painter]]. His early work was influenced by [[Francis Wheatley (painter)]] but after the 1790s he came into his own style. His best compositions focus on rustic scenes: farms and hunting; smugglers and gypsies; and rich, textured landscapes informed by [[Dutch Golden Age painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Gowing]], ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.3 (Facts on File, 2005): 472.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Morland was born in London on 26 June 1763. He was the son of [[Henry Robert Morland]], and grandson of [[George Henry Morland]], said by Cunningham to have been lineally descended from Sir [[Samuel Morland]], while other biographers go so far as to say that he had only to claim the baronetcy in order to get it. 
Morland began to draw at the age of three years, and at the age of ten (1773) his name appears as an honorary exhibitor of sketches at the [[Royal Academy]]. He continued to exhibit at the Free Society in 1775 and 1776, and at the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain|Society of Artists]] in 1777, and then again at the Royal Academy in 1778, 1779 and 1780.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Morland, George|volume=18|page=839|first=George Charles|last=Williamson|authorlink=George Charles Williamson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His talents were carefully cultivated by his father, who was accused of stimulating them unduly with a view to his own profit, shutting the child up in a garret to make drawings from pictures and casts for which he found a ready sale. 
The boy, on the other hand, is said to have soon found a way to make money for himself by hiding some of his drawings, and lowering them at nightfall out of his window to young accomplices, with whom he used to spend the proceeds in frolic and self-indulgence. 
It has been also asserted that his father, discovering this trick, tried to conciliate him by indulgence, humouring his whims and encouraging his low tastes.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

He was set by his father to copy pictures of all kinds, but especially of the Dutch and Flemish masters. Among others he copied [[Fuseli]]'s ''Nightmare'' and [[Joshua Reynolds|Reynolds]]'s ''Garrick between Tragedy and Comedy''. 
He was also introduced to Sir Joshua Reynolds, and obtained permission to copy his pictures, and all accounts agree that before he was seventeen he had obtained considerable reputation not only with his friends and the dealers, but among artists of repute. 
A convincing proof of the skill in original composition which he had then attained is the fine engraving by [[William Ward (engraver)|William Ward]], after his picture of ''The Angler's Repast'', which was published in November 1780 by [[John Raphael Smith]]. 
It is said that before his apprenticeship to his father came to an end, in 1784, Romney offered to take him into his own house, with a salary of £300, on condition of his signing articles for three years. 
But Morland, we are told, had had enough of restraint, and after a rupture with his father he set up on his own account in 1784 or 1785 at the house of a picture dealer, and commenced that life which, in its combination of hard work and hard drinking, is almost without a parallel.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

Morland soon became the mere slave of the dealer with whom he lived. 
His boon companions were "ostlers, potboys, horse jockeys, moneylenders, pawnbrokers, punks, and pugilists."
In this company the handsome young artist swaggered, dressed in a green coat, with large yellow buttons, leather breeches, and top boots. "He was in the very extreme of foppish puppeyism", says Hassell; "his head, when ornamented according to his own taste, resembled a snowball, after the model of Tippey Bob, of dramatic memory, to which was attached a short, thick tail, not unlike a painter's brush."
His youth and strong constitution enabled him to recover rapidly from his excesses, and he not only employed the intervals in painting, but at this time, or shortly afterwards, taught himself to play the violin. 
He made also an effort, and a successful one, to free himself from his task-master, and escaped to [[Margate]], where he painted miniatures for a while. 
In 1785 he paid a short visit to France, whither his fame had preceded him, and where he had no lack of commissions.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

Returning to London, he lodged in a house at [[Kensal Green]], on the road to [[Harrow, London|Harrow]], near [[William Ward (engraver)|William Ward]], intercourse with whose family seems for a time to have had a steadying influence. It resulted in his marriage with Miss Anne Ward (Nancy), the sister of his friend, in July 1786, and the bond between the families was strengthened a month later by the marriage of William Ward and Morland's sister Maria. 
The two newly married couples set up house together in High Street, Marylebone, and Morland for a while appeared to have become a reformed character. 
He was now becoming known by such engravings from his pictures as the large 'Children Nutting' (1783), and several smaller and more sentimental subjects published in 1785, like the ' Lass of Livingston.' To 1786, the year of his marriage, is said to belong the series of 'Letitia or Seduction' (well known from the engravings published in 1789), in which with much of the narrative power of Hogarth, but with softer touches, the 'Progress' of Letitia is told in six scenes admirable in design, and painted with great skill, finish, and refinement. About this period he was fond of visiting the [[Isle of Wight]], where he painted his best coast scenes, and studied life and character in a low public-house at Freshwater Gate, called the Cabin.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}} In 1786 he painted ''The Wreck of the Haswell'', an oil on canvas. It shows women and children clutching what little of the ship remains afloat while a crewman's eyes tell the eventual fate of his half-submerged body. It clearly conveys the terror and hopelessness that must grip people when they know they're taking their last breath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB904788499185335500|title=Inside a Nautical Lost and Found|first=Mark|last=Yost|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
[[File:Two pigs lying in straw in an outdoor pen. Etching with aqua Wellcome V0021681.jpg|thumb|left|Etching: ''Two pigs lying in straw in an outdoor pen''.]]

After three months the double household was broken up by dissensions between the ladies, and Morland took lodgings in Great Portland Street, and afterwards moved to Camden Town, where he lived in a small house in Pleasing Passage, at the back of the tavern known as Mother Black Cap. The attractions of the neighbouring inns, and of the Assembly Rooms at Kentish Town, now proved too strong for him, and he returned to all his bad habits. 
A long illness of his wife, following her confinement and death of the child, further weakened the influence of home, and he neglected and ultimately left his wife, though he seems to have made her an allowance as long as he lived. 
When he finally separated from her it is not easy to determine, and his course afterwards was so erratic that it is difficult to trace it with minuteness and order. He moved from Pleasing Passage to Warrens Lane, and seems for some time to have made his headquarters at Paddington. 
It was here probably that he painted the celebrated picture of 'The Inside of a Stable,' now in the [[National Gallery]], which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1791. 
The stable is said to be that of the White Lion Inn at Paddington, opposite to which he lived. 
At this time he was at the plenitude of his power, and dissipation had not impaired the sureness of his touch, his unusually fine sense of colour, or the refinement of his artistic feeling. He exhibited again in 1793 and 1794, but though he still painted finely he had become completely the prey of the dealers, painting as it were from hand to mouth to supply himself with funds for his extravagances. 
His art was so popular that, comparatively small as was the price which he actually received for his labour, he might have easily lived for a week on the earnings of a day. He was besieged by dealers who came to him, as it is said, with a purse in one hand and a bottle in the other. 
The amount of work he got through was prodigious. 
He would paint one or two pictures a day, and once painted a large landscape with six figures in the course of six hours. 
Every demand that was made upon him, whether a tavern score or the renewal of a bill, was paid by a picture. 
And they were good pictures too, generally worth many times the value of the account to be settled, and always popular in engravings. {{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

==Career==
[[File:George Morland - The Old Water Mill - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Old Water Mill'']]
[[File:George Morland - Winter Landscape - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|George Morland - ''Winter Landscape'']]
[[File:George Morland - Old horses with a dog in a stable - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Horses with a dog in a stable'']]

From 1788 to 1792 inclusive, over a hundred engravings after Morland were published. 
They included 'A Visit to the Child at Home' and 'A Visit to the Boarding School,' two compositions of remarkable refinement and elegance, and a number of charming scenes of children's sports, like 'Children Birdnesting,' 'Juvenile Navigation,' 'The Kite entangled,' 'Blind Man's Buff,' and 'Children playing at Soldiers.' Equalling if not exceeding these in popularity were scenes of moral contrast, like 'The Fruits of early Industry and Economy' (1789) and 'The Effects of Extravagance and Idleness' (1794), the 'Miseries of Idleness' and the 'Comforts of Industry,' both published in 1790, and subjects appealing to national sentiment, like 'The Slave Trade' (1791) and 'African Hospitality.' Five hundred copies of the engraving of 'Dancing Dogs' (1790) were sold in a few weeks, and one dealer gave an order for nine dozen sets of the four plates of 'The Deserter' (1791). Elegant and refined subjects gradually gave place exclusively to scenes from humble life in town and country, including the coast with fishermen and smugglers, sporting scenes, but more frequently, in a plain but seldom a coarse manner, the life of the cottage, the stable, and the inn-yard, with lively groups of natural men and women, and still more natural horses, donkeys, dogs, pigs, poultry, and other animals. 
About 250 separate engravings from his works appeared in his lifetime.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

Although the publishers reaped the benefits of their large sale, Morland's credit and resources enabled him for some years to lead the rollicking life he loved without much pressure of care. 
At one time he kept eight saddle horses at the White Lion. 
As time went on debts increased and creditors became more pressing, and he lived a hunted life, only able to escape from the bailiffs by his knowledge of London and the assistance of friends and dealers. He flitted from one house to another, residing among other places at Lambeth, East Sheen, Queen Anne Street, the Minories, Kensington, and Hackney. 
At Hackney his seclusion aroused the suspicion that he was a forger of bank notes, and his premises were searched at the instance of the bank directors, who afterwards made him a present of 40l. for the inconvenience caused by their mistake.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

Dealers and innkeepers also would keep rooms ready for him to paint in, supplied with the necessary materials, and there was generally some dealer at hand ready to carry off his pictures before they were dry, often before they were finished. 
Morland was not, however, much more scrupulous in his dealings than the dealers themselves, and a picture begun under contract with one would be parted with to another who had money in his hand, if the rightful owner was not there to claim it. 
In this way a number of pictures got into the market commenced by Morland, and finished by inferior hands, while hundreds of copies were made and sold as originals. 'I once saw,' says Hassell, 'twelve copies from a small picture of Morland's at one time in a dealer's shop, with the original in the centre.' 
Another dealer (according to Redgrave), in whose house he painted under contract in the morning for several years (commencing about 1794), had each morning's work regularly copied. Occasionally Morland managed to escape from both dealers and bailiffs. 
Once he paid a visit to [[Claude Lorraine Smith]] in Leicestershire. 
He was apprehended as a spy at [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]]. 
He painted the sign of an inn called the Black Bull, somewhere on the road between Deal and London.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

In November 1799, Morland was at last arrested for debt, but was allowed to take lodgings 'within the rules,' and these became the rendezvous of his most discreditable friends. 
During this mitigated confinement he sank lower and lower. 
He is said to have often been drunk for days together, and to have generally slept on the floor in a helpless condition. 
It is probable that these stories are exaggerated, for he still produced an enormous quantity of good work. 
'For his brother alone,' says Redgrave, 'he painted 192 pictures between 1800 and 1804, and he probably painted as many more for other dealers during the same period, his terms being four guineas a day and his drink.' 
Another account says that 'during his last eight years he painted 490 pictures for his brother, and probably three hundred more for others, besides making hundreds of drawings. 
His total production is estimated at no less than four thousand pictures. 
In 1802, he was released under the [[Insolvent Debtors Act]], but his health was ruined and his habits irremediable. 
About this time he was seized with palsy and lost the use of his left hand, so that he could not hold his palette. 
Notwithstanding he seems to have gone on painting to the last, when he was arrested again for a publican's score, and died in a sponging-house in Eyre Street, Cold Bath Fields, on 27 October 1804. His wife died three days afterwards, and both were buried together in the burial-ground attached to [[St. James's Chapel]] in the Hampstead Road.{{sfn|Monkhouse|1894}}

==Works==
[[File:George Morland - Setters - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Dogs In Landscape - ''Setters'']]
The finest of Morland's pictures were executed between 1790 and 1794, and amongst them his picture ''The inside of a stable''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=10291&amp;searchid=9762|title=‘Inside of a Stable’, George Morland, exhibited 1791 - Tate|first=|last=Tate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Tate Britain]], London) may be reckoned as a masterpiece. In the last eight years of his life Morland produced some nine hundred paintings, besides over a thousand drawings.

He exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy from 1784 down to 1804. 
Amongst these was the remarkable 1788 picture ''Execrable Human Traffic or the Affectionate Slaves''. 
Two years later he exhibited a companion picture showing Africans caring for shipwrecked Europeans. They were subsequently published as prints and served to promote abolitionism.&lt;ref&gt;See the article by Meredith Gamer in ''The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012. {{ISBN|9781908590435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morland was a close friend of fellow artist, [[William Armfield Hobday]] (1771–1831) who painted a portrait of the artist which is still intact. [[William Collins (painter)|William Collins]] was an informal pupil and later wrote a biography.

''Gran Torino'' grossed nearly $270 million worldwide (making it Eastwood's second highest-grossing film to date).&lt;ref name="BoxMojo" /&gt; Within the Hmong community in the United States, the film received both praise and criticism.

==Plot==
[[Walt Kowalski]] is a cantankerous, retired [[Polish American]] [[assembly line]] worker and [[Korean War]] veteran, who has recently been widowed after 50 years of marriage, causing him to be a [[lapsed Catholic]]. His [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]] neighborhood in the [[Detroit]] area of Michigan, formerly populated by working-class white families, is now dominated by poor Asian immigrants, and [[gang]] violence is commonplace. Adding to his isolation and detachment are his feelings towards his married sons and their families.

He rejects a suggestion from one of his sons to move to a retirement community (sensing that they want his home and possessions), and lives alone with his elderly dog, Daisy.  A longtime cigarette smoker, Walt suffers from coughing fits, occasionally coughing up blood, but conceals this from his family. Roman Catholic priest Father Janovich tries to comfort him, but Walt disdains the young, inexperienced man. Eventually, Walt opens up to the priest, revealing that he is still haunted by memories of the war.

The [[Hmong people|Hmong]] Vang Lor family reside next door to Walt. Initially, he wants nothing to do with his new neighbors, particularly after he catches [[Thao Vang Lor|Thao]] attempting to steal his [[Ford Torino#1972.E2.80.931976: Gran Torino|1972 Ford Gran Torino]] as a coerced initiation into a Hmong gang run by Thao's cousin, Fong, whose nickname is "Spider". The gang is infuriated by Thao's failure and they attack him, but Walt confronts them with an [[M1 Garand]] rifle and chases them off, earning the respect of the Hmong community.

As penance, Thao's mother makes him work for Walt, who has him do [[Handyman|odd jobs]] around the neighborhood, and the two form a grudging mutual respect. Thao's sister Sue introduces Walt to Hmong culture and helps him bond with the Hmong community, who soon become more like family to Walt than his actual family and he, in turn, becomes a better man to them than he was to his own sons. Walt helps Thao get a job and gives him dating advice. Walt eventually visits a doctor regarding his coughing fits, where it's implied that he does not have long to live.

Spider's gang continues to pressure Thao, assaulting him on his way home from work. After he sees Thao's injuries, Walt visits the gang's house, where he attacks a gang member as a warning. In retaliation, the gang performs a [[drive-by shooting]] on the Vang Lor home, injuring Thao. They also beat up Sue, and Walt is upset by this. Father Janovich tells him that the gang raped her and she is safe at the hospital. There are no other witnesses; the community members, including the victims, refuse to assist the police to incriminate the gang members.

The next day, Thao seeks Walt's help to exact revenge, and Walt tells him to return later in the afternoon. In the meantime, Walt makes personal preparations: he buys a suit, gets a haircut, and makes a [[Confession (religion)|confession]] to Father Janovich, who had pressured him to make it at the behest of his late wife. When Thao returns, Walt takes him to the basement, gives him his [[Silver Star]] medal, then locks him in the basement and tells him of his haunting memory of having killed a surrendering enemy soldier. He keeps Thao locked in the basement, until the revenge is over, to make sure the boy will never be haunted by killing someone, with his life ahead of him.

That night, Walt goes to the gang members' house, where they draw their firearms on him. He loudly berates them and enumerates their crimes, drawing the attention of the neighbors. Putting a cigarette in his mouth, he asks for a light, then puts his hand in the pocket of his jacket and provocatively pulls it out as if he were holding a gun, causing the gang members to shoot and kill him. As he falls to the ground, his hand opens to reveal the [[Zippo]] cigarette lighter with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry]] insignia; he was unarmed. His plan had in fact been to provoke them into killing him in public. Sue, following Walt's directions, frees Thao, and they drive to the scene in Walt's Gran Torino. One of the police officers tells them that all gang members have been placed under arrest for the murder, and due to the number of witnesses, they all face a lengthy sentence in prison.

Walt's funeral mass is celebrated by Father Janovich and attended by his family and many of the Hmong community, many of whom are wearing traditional attire; their presence visibly puzzles Walt's family. Later, his last will and testament is read. To his family's surprise, Walt leaves them nothing. His house goes to the church and his cherished Gran Torino goes to Thao, with the condition that he does not modify the vehicle. Later, Thao is seen driving the car along [[Jefferson Avenue (Detroit)|Jefferson Avenue]] with Daisy.

According to Schenk, aside from changing Minneapolis references to Detroit references, the production headed by Eastwood "didn't change a single syllable" in the script.&lt;ref name="YuenAlmost"&gt;Yuen, Laura.

===Selection of Detroit for production and setting===
The original script was inspired by the [[Northeast, Minneapolis|Northeast]] community of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], but filmmakers chose to shoot in [[Michigan]], becoming one of the first productions to take advantage of the state's new law that provided lucrative incentive packages to film productions.&lt;ref name="graham"&gt;{{cite news |last=Graham |first=Adam |title=Clint Eastwood attracts giddy gawkers |work=[[The Detroit News]] |date=2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Huizenga]], a man from [[Zeeland, Michigan|Zeeland]], [[Michigan]] who once served in the [[Michigan House of Representatives]], helped write and coordinate the State of Michigan's incentive package to the film creators.&lt;ref name=grp&gt;{{cite news |first=Rachel|last=Recker|title=Gran Torino actress Ahney Her returns to Michigan for opening night |url=http://www.mlive.com/movies/index.ssf/2009/01/gran_torino_actress_ahney_her_1.html|work= [[The Grand Rapids Press]] |publisher= |date=2009-01-09 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ultimately received a 42% [[tax credit]].

===Hmong people and culture during the production===
[[Nick Schenk]] said that he became friends with many Hmong coworkers while employed at a VHS factory in [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]], [[Minnesota]]. In regards to Schenk's stories of his interactions with the Hmong people, Laura Yuen of ''[[Minnesota Public Radio]]'' said "That sense of humor and curiosity permeate the script, even though the ''Gran Torino'' trailers make the movie look like, by all measures, a drama."&lt;ref name="YuenAlmost"/&gt;

Eastwood wanted Hmong as cast members, so casting director [[Ellen Chenoweth]] enlisted Hmong organizations and set up calls in Detroit, Fresno and Saint Paul; Fresno and Saint Paul have the two largest Hmong communities in the United States, while Detroit also has an appreciable population of Hmong.&lt;ref name="donn2"/&gt; Chenoweth recruited [[Bee Vang]] in St. Paul and [[Ahney Her]] in Detroit.&lt;ref name="LongwellHmong1" /&gt;

The screenplay was written entirely in [[English language|English]]. Therefore, the actors of ''Gran Torino'' improvised the [[Hmong language|Hmong]] used in the film.

Louisa Schein and Va-Megn Thoj, authors of "''Gran Torino''’s Boys and Men with Guns: Hmong Perspectives," said "Perhaps the most commonly voiced Hmong objections to the film concern its myriad cultural inaccuracies, exaggerations and distortion."&lt;ref name="Schein49"&gt;Schein and Thoj, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Schein also said that "[t]he [Hmong] actors struggle, too, with their culture being made into spectacle."&lt;ref name="set"/&gt; Even though a real Hmong shaman acts as a Hmong shaman in the film, Schein said that "his expertise was overridden by the screenplay and the filming, which distorted the ceremonial scenes by making them inaccurately exotic."&lt;ref name="set"/&gt; Vang said that the tea ceremonies depicted in the film were not correctly performed.&lt;ref name="Reyes-Ortiz"/&gt; Even though, in the film, Hmong characters feel offense when Walt touches a girl on the head, Schein said that in real life in Hmong culture it is okay to touch a person on the head.&lt;ref name="Battle"/&gt; In other segments of the film, the Hmong shaman touches a baby's head without any negative criticism. Schein adds that Spider touches [[Thao Vang Lor]]'s head "without consequence."&lt;ref name="Schein49"/&gt; Christine Wilson Owens, author of "Hmong Cultural Profile," said "Most traditional Hmong elders, especially men, do not want strangers to touch their heads, or those of their children, due to their religious beliefs and personal values."&lt;ref name="HmongHead1"/&gt;

In the film the shaman himself does a sacrifice of a chicken in a manner that Schein and Thoj say is "in dramatic ceremonial fashion," when in real life an assistant would do this "perfunctorily."&lt;ref name="Schein49"/&gt; The authors said that the ''hu plis'' ceremony done in honor of the baby has an incorrect spatial layout, that the clothing and grooming of the Hmong gangs is not correct, and "the obsequious making of offerings on doorstep" are not accurate.&lt;ref name="Schein49"/&gt; While Thao himself cleans dishes, Schein and Thoj add that he would not do this alone because he is in a house with other female family members.&lt;ref name="Schein49"/&gt; Schein and Thoj also add that there is "inconsistent use of the two Hmong dialects within one family."&lt;ref name="Schein49"/&gt; They also argue that members of a Hmong clan would not show aggression towards a member of a fellow clan and that they would not rape a member of their own clan, like the gang in the film rapes Sue.&lt;ref name="Schein49"/&gt; Sharon Her, a Hmong writer from New York, argued that the film had "confusion of Asian customs" and that "Hmong people do not use favors as a method of atonement nor do they endlessly shower individuals with gifts out of gratitude."&lt;ref name=HoffmanHer&gt;Hoffman, Kevin.

==Reception==

===Critical reviews===
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 80% of 224 surveyed critics gave the film positive write-ups; the average score is 7.1/10. The site's consensus states: "Though a minor entry in Eastwood's body of work, ''Gran Torino'' is nevertheless a humorous, touching, and intriguing old-school parable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gran_torino/ |title=Gran Torino Movie Reviews |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=IGN Entertainment |accessdate=2009-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''[[Metacritic]]'', which assigns a [[weighted average]] score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 72 based on 34 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/grantorino |title=Gran Torino (2008): Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=CNET Networks |accessdate=2009-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seeing the film, ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the [[requiem]] tone captured by the film, calling it as "a sleek, muscle car of a movie made in the USA, in that industrial graveyard called Detroit". [[Manohla Dargis]] compared Eastwood's presence on film to ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' and the ''[[Man with No Name]]'', stating: "Dirty Harry is back, in a way, in ''Gran Torino'', not as a character, but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high-caliber imagery, and of course, most obviously, in Mr. Eastwood’s face. It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated that it no longer looks merely weathered, as it has for decades, but seems closer to petrified wood."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' also praised Eastwood's performance and credibility as an action hero at the age of 78. [[Kenneth Turan]] said of Eastwood's performance, "It is a film that is impossible to imagine without the actor in the title role. The notion of a 78-year-old action hero may sound like a contradiction in terms, but Eastwood brings it off, even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical. Even at 78, Eastwood can make 'Get off my lawn' sound as menacing as 'Make my day', and when he says 'I blow a hole in your face and sleep like a baby', he sounds as if he means it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turan |first=Kenneth |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/la-et-torino12-2008dec12,0,2314630.story |title=Review: ''Gran Torino'': Clint Eastwood, at 78, shows he's still a formidable action figure |date=December 12, 2008 |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=December 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film is "about the belated flowering of a man's better nature.

[[Mark Harris (journalist)|Mark Harris]], columnist for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', described it as "fantasy pretending to be social commentary", and accused it of peddling "the delusion that even the bigot next door has something to teach us all about heroism and self-sacrifice", adding "no, he doesn't".&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Mark.

Retrieved on March 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Nicole Sperling, also of ''Entertainment Weekly'', perceived it in the exact opposite manner. She called it a drama with "the commercial hook of a genre film" and described it further as "a meditation on tolerance wrapped in the disguise of a movie with a gun-toting Clint Eastwood and a cool car".&lt;ref&gt;Sperling, Nicole.

===Reception in relation to the Hmong===
[[Clint Eastwood]]'s decision to cast Hmong actors, including amateur actors, received a positive reception in Hmong communities.&lt;ref name="OBrienSchein"&gt;O'Brien, Kathleen. "[http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/01/rutgers_scholar_helps_eastwood.html Rutgers scholar sheds light on 'Gran Torino' ethnic stars]." ''[[The Star-Ledger]]''. Thursday January 15, 2009. Retrieved on March 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Tou Ger Xiong, a Hmong storyteller and performance artist from the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] who had auditioned for a role in the film, said that he had respect for the film because the producers actually cast Hmong instead of asking other Asian-Americans to mimic Hmong.&lt;ref name="YuenMixed"/&gt; Xiong also argued "First things first, let's get our foot in the door. Complain later."&lt;ref name="YuenMixed"/&gt; Dyane Hang Garvey, who served as a cultural consultant for the film production, said that the film was not intended to be a documentary on the Hmong people and that it positively highlights, as paraphrased by Laura Yuen of ''[[Minnesota Public Radio]]'', "the close-knit nature of the Hmong community in Detroit".&lt;ref name="YuenMixed"/&gt; [[Doua Moua]], a Hmong actor in the film, said that he had no regrets in playing a gang member, because, in the words of Laura Yuen of ''[[Minnesota Public Radio]]'', "gangs consumed his brother's life while they were growing up in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]]".&lt;ref name="YuenMixed"/&gt; Moua added that many first generation Hmong are affected by gangs and drift into gangs due to a lack of father figures.&lt;ref name="YuenMixed"/&gt;

Louisa Schein, a [[Rutgers University]] anthropologist who is an expert on the [[Hmong customs and culture|Hmong culture]], approved the concept of Hmong achieving visibility in the [[popular culture of the United States]], but believed that the film may be promoting out of date stereotypes of the Hmong. Schein said that her Hmong friends were "touched" by the film's portrayal of Hmong culture redeeming and reaching out to [[Walt Kowalski]].&lt;ref name="OBrienSchein"/&gt; [[Bee Vang]], one of the Hmong actors, said that he was satisfied with the outcome of the film.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.hmongtoday.com/page11502451.aspx Bee Vang Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628200759/http://www.hmongtoday.com/page11502451.aspx |date=June 28, 2010 }}."

Schein further added that the film seemed to give little prominence to the history of the Hmong, and that only two male Hmong, Thao and a gang member, were given depth in the story. Schein said "I feel a lot of the plot about the Eastwood character is driven by the fact that he is a veteran. Yet there is no possibility for representing the fact that the Hmong were veterans too."&lt;ref name="OBrienSchein"/&gt; An individual established a blog, eastwoodmovie-hmong.com, documenting what the author believed to be cultural inaccuracies of the film's depiction of the Hmong.&lt;ref name="set"/&gt;

David Brauer of ''[[MinnPost]]'' said that some Hmong liked ''Gran Torino'' and that many believed that the film was offensive.&lt;ref name="Brauer"/&gt; Actor Bee Vang said "Hmong around the country were furious about its negative stereotypes and cultural distortions" and that they confronted him when he spoke at events.&lt;ref name="Brauer"/&gt; Vang added that he engaged in "explaining my obligation as an actor while also recognizing that, as a Hmong-American, I didn't feel that I could own the lines I was uttering."&lt;ref name="Brauer"/&gt; Brauer said that in an opinion editorial released in 2011, Vang "isn't kind to the Clint Eastwood film".&lt;ref name="Brauer"/&gt; Krissy Reyes-Ortiz of ''[[University of California Santa Barbara|The Bottom Line]]'' of the [[University of California Santa Barbara]] said, based on Vang's testimony in a 2011 program, that "Though many of the people who have seen the film may have gotten a sense of satisfaction and joy from seeing that Walt overcame his racism, the people who acted as the Hmong members in the movie did not" and that "They were offended by the traces of racism that were included in the movie and that they experienced themselves on set".&lt;ref name="Reyes-Ortiz"/&gt; Some Hmong on internet message boards had posted criticisms of the film.&lt;ref name="YuenMixed"/&gt;

Philip W. Chung of ''[[AsianWeek]]'' said that Eastwood, portraying a White man, was the "main weapon" of the film even though screenwriter [[Nick Schenk]] "does his best to portray Hmong culture and the main Hmong characters with both depth and cultural sensitivity".&lt;ref name=ChungWhiteMan&gt;Chung, Philip W. {{cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/2008/12/31/the-white-man-saves-the-day-again-clint-eastwood-in-gran-torino-2/ |title="The White Man Saves the Day Again?" |accessdate=2012-03-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212154857/http://www.asianweek.com/2008/12/31/the-white-man-saves-the-day-again-clint-eastwood-in-gran-torino-2/ |archivedate=February 12, 2009 |df=mdy-all }} ''[[AsianWeek]]''. December 31, 2008.

The film, however, was ignored by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] at the [[81st Academy Awards]] when it was not nominated for a single Oscar, which led to heated criticism from many who felt that the Academy had also deliberately snubbed ''[[Revolutionary Road (film)|Revolutionary Road]]'', ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'' and ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]'' (which Eastwood also directed) from the five major categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lemire |first=Christy |title=Oscar nomination surprises and snubs |url=http://www.masslive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2009/01/oscar_nomination_surprises_and.html |agency=Associated Press |date=2009-01-22 |accessdate=2009-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kreps |first=Daniel |title=Oscars Snub Springsteen, Celebrate "Slumdog" As Nominations Are Announced |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/01/22/oscars-snub-springsteen-celebrate-slumdog-as-nominations-are-announced/ |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2009-01-22 |accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cinema ==

===Features===
Gross-out is a [[genre|subgenre]] of comedy movies in which the makers employ humor that is willfully "tasteless"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pryor]|first=Joe Garner ; foreword by Richard|title=Made you laugh! : the funniest moments in radio, television, stand-up, and movie comedy|year=2004|publisher=Andrews McMeel Pub.|location=Kansas City|isbn=0-7407-4695-2|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or even downright disgusting. It usually involves gratuitous nudity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Capsuto|first=Steven|title=Alternate channels : the uncensored story of gay and lesbian images on radio and television|year=2000|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-345-41243-5|pages=250|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; unrealistic aggressiveness towards property or [[Schadenfreude]]. The movies are generally aimed at a younger audience aged between 18 and 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Geoff|title=Film comedy|year=2002|publisher=Wallflower|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=1-903364-35-3|pages=73|edition=repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One boon of this genre is that it provides an inexpensive way to make a movie "edgy" and to generate media attention for it.

===History===
In the United States, following the abolition of the film industry's censorious [[Production Code]] and its replacement with the [[MPAA film rating system]] in the late 1960s, some filmmakers began to experiment with subversive&lt;ref name= "Mitchell03"&gt;{{cite news | last = Mitchell | first = Elvis | authorlink = Elvis Mitchell | title = Revisiting Faber College (Toga, Toga, Toga!) | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages =  | language = | publisher = | date=25 August 2003 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/25/movies/critic-s-notebook-revisiting-faber-college-toga-toga-toga.html | accessdate = 2011-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; film comedies, which explicitly dealt with taboo subjects such as sex and other bodily functions.  Noteworthy examples include 1972's ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' (in which the central character eats dog excrement) and other films by [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], and 1974's sketch comedy film ''[[The Groove Tube]]''. As these films emerged from the [[counterculture]] movement and gained a measure of audience success,&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; they inspired more mainstream films to follow their example. However, long before the Production Code, early silent comedy film makers produced and attempted several 'gross-out' pictures to the disdain of early film reviewers. One such example is the [[lost film|lost]] ''[[Nell's Eugenic Wedding]]'' starring [[Fay Tincher]] and [[Tod Browning]].

The label "gross-out movie" was first applied by the mainstream media to [[1978 in film|1978]]'s ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'s [[Animal House]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernheimer|first=Kathryn|title=The 50 funniest movies of all time : a critic's ranking|year=1999|publisher=Carol Pub. Group|location=Secaucus, N.J.|isbn=0-8065-2091-4|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; a comedy about the [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] experience at [[Higher education in the United States|US colleges]].&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; Its humor included not only explicit use of bodily functions (like projectile vomiting), but also references to topical political matters like [[Kent State shootings]], [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Vietnam war]], and the [[Civil rights movement#Civil rights movement in the United States|civil rights movement]].&lt;ref name= "Peterson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Peterson | first = Molly | title = ''National Lampoon's Animal House'' | work = [[National Public Radio]] | date = July 29, 2002 | url = https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/animalhouse/ | accessdate = 2010-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was a great [[box office]] success despite its limited production costs and thus started an industry trend.&lt;ref name="Mitchell03"/&gt; Since then, gross-out films increased in number, and became almost the norm for American comedy films. Some films of this genre could be aimed at teen audiences (such as ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', ''[[Porky's]]'', ''[[American Pie (series)|American Pie]]'' or ''[[Eurotrip]]''), while others are targeted at somewhat more mature audiences (such as ''[[There's Something About Mary]]'', ''[[The Hangover (film)|The Hangover]]'' or ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'').

== Television ==
{{advert|date=June 2012}}

''The Tom Green Show and [[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' and its UK cousin, ''[[Dirty Sanchez (television series)|Dirty Sanchez]]'', were the pioneers of "gross out television".  The shows featured dangerous [[stunts]], [[nudity]], [[profanity]], and action new to the television platform. Both series were featured on [[MTV]], and progressed to feature-length movies.  ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'', [[Rugrats]], [[Rocko's Modern Life]],  [[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]], and ''[[Animaniacs]]'' transferred the gross-out television genre to the medium of small screen [[animation]] largely in the early 1990s. Today this continues with such shows as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', [[Regular Show]], [[American Dad!]] and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.

== Theater ==

Gross-out [[theater]] is increasingly practiced on stage, particularly in the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. However, it is also displayed in the larger and more adventurous [[United Kingdom|British]] theaters.

The prime examples of the above are the stage version of the contemporary drama ''[[Trainspotting (novel)#Stage adaptation|Trainspotting]]'' by bestselling playwright and author [[Irvine Welsh]]; the controversial New York musical ''[[Urinetown]]'' by Kotis and Hollmann; the outrageous [[anarchistic]] schlockomedy (shock horror comedy) musical about a Manchester jobcentre ''Restart'' by Komedy Kollective;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komedykollective.com komedykollective.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and performances by another United Kingdom-based act, Forced Entertainment, who devised the [[iconic]] theatrical [[gorefest]] ''Bloody Mess''.

== Art ==

Controversial American cartoonist and vaudeville performer [[Basil Wolverton]] invented his trademark "[[spaghetti]] and [[meatball]]s" style of artwork.

Various artists helped create a flourishing gross-out art scene, which began mainly in the 1990s, the most famous of which were [[Damien Hirst]], known for encasing mutilated, rotting [[cattle]] in [[formaldehyde]], and making art of [[endangered]] [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[species]] such as [[shark]]s in formaldehyde tanks, and [[Tracey Emin]], whose [[Art exhibition|exhibit]] of an unmade [[bed]] featured used [[tampons]], [[condoms]] and blood-stained [[underwear]].

== Music ==

Gross out themes are common in popular music genres, such as [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[hard rock]], where shock value helps create marketable notoriety.  Bands include [[Blink-182]] famous for including [[breast]] and [[fart]] jokes in their songs, while bands such as [[Cannibal Corpse]] and [[Agoraphobic Nosebleed]] write extremely revolting lyrics designed to induce nausea and shock the music world.

Probably the biggest gross-out shock to the music world was the act of [[GG Allin]]. Allin was infamous for his transgressive music act, which included eating excrement, mutilating himself and attacking audience members.

Sometimes the line between truth and [[urban myth]] is blurred by the [[sensationalist]] sections of the media.  For example, [[Frank Zappa]] never ate steaming excrement live on-stage, and the famed incident involving [[Ozzy Osbourne]] biting a head off of a bat was actually unintentional (he thought the bat was a prop).

Similar themes are also sometimes conveyed in music videos, the aptly named Gross Out, a [[Single (music)|single]] from [[indie (music)|indie]]/[[garage rock]] band, [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]].

'''Harlon Henry Block''' (November 6, 1924 – March 1, 1945) was a [[United States Marine Corps]] corporal who was killed in action during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] in [[World War II]].

Born in [[Yorktown, Texas]], Block joined the Marine Corps with seven high school classmates in February 1943, and subsequently participated in combat on [[Bougainville campaign (1943-45)|Bougainville]] and Iwo Jima. He is best known for being one of the six flag-raisers who helped raise the second  [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]] atop Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945, as shown in the iconic photograph ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''.

The [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] located in Arlington, Virginia, which was modeled after the flag-raising photograph, depicts bronze statues of each of the six Marine flag-raisers.

== Early life ==
Block was born in [[Yorktown, Texas]], the third of six children to Edward Frederick Block and Ada Belle Brantley, a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh day-Adventist]] family.&lt;ref name=TSHA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marines.mil/unit/mcbhawaii/Pages/2005/Famed%20Iwo%20Jima%20flag%20raisers%20gone%20but%20not%20forgotten.aspx |title=Famed Iwo Jima flag raisers gone but not forgotten |publisher=Marines.mil |date= |accessdate=2012-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007080257/http://www.marines.mil/unit/mcbhawaii/Pages/2005/Famed%20Iwo%20Jima%20flag%20raisers%20gone%20but%20not%20forgotten.aspx |archivedate=2012-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Block children were: Edward, Jr., Maurine, Harlon, Larry, Corky, and Melford.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Frederick Block was a [[World War I]] veteran and supported his family by working as a dairy farmer.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In hopes of improving the family, the Block family relocated to [[Weslaco, Texas]], a city located in the [[Rio Grande Valley]]. His father became a dairy farmer, and the children attended a Seventh-day Adventist private school. Harlon Block was expelled in his freshman year when he refused to tell the principal which student had vandalized the school. Block then transferred to [[Weslaco High School]] and was remembered as an outgoing student with many friends. A natural athlete, Block led the Weslaco Panther Football Team to the Conference Championship. He was honored as "All South Texas End". Block and seven of his high school friends decided on joining the Marine Corps before they graduated and the school held a special early graduation ceremony for them in January 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks, Mark (7/26/2001), ''Iwo Jima: In Memory Of A Friend'', 7/26/2001 [http://www.dianahendricks.com/clips--essays--mark/in-memory-of-a-friend] Retrieved January 10, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.adventistreview.org/meet-harlan-block,-the-seventh-day-adventist-who-helped-raise-the-u.s.-flag-on-iwo-jima Meet Harlan Block, the Seventh-day Adventist Who Helped Raise the U.S. Flag on Iwo Jima] Retrieved October 12, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War II ===

Block and seven of his high school football teammates enlisted together in the Marine Corps through the [[Selective Service System]] at [[San Antonio]] on February 18, 1943 and were sent to recruit training at the [[MCRD San Diego|Marine Corps Recruit Depot]] in [[San Diego]]. On April 14, Block began [[parachute]] training at the Marine Parachute Training School in San Diego, and on May 22, he qualified as a [[Paramarine]] and was promoted to [[private first class]]. He was sent to the [[Pacific Theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]]. He arrived at [[New Caledonia]] on November 15, where he served as a member of Headquarters and Service Company, [[1st Marine Parachute Regiment]], [[I Marine Amphibious Corps]]. On December 21, he landed on [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]]. On December 22, 1st Parachute Battalion, Weapons Company and a Headquarters and Service platoon attached to the 2nd Marine Raider Regiment, relieved the [[1st Battalion, 3rd Marines]] in the vicinity of Eagle Creek on Bougainville. Block returned to San Diego with his unit on February 14. On February 29, the parachutists disbanded and Block joined the Second Platoon, E Company, [[2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment]], [[5th Marine Division]] at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton, California]] on March 1. He was promoted to [[corporal]] on October 27, 1944.

==== Flag raising(s) on Mount Suribachi ====
[[File:Iwo Jima Suribachi DN-SD-03-11845.JPEG|thumb|right|Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima]]
[[File:Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima (color).ogg|thumb|'''Block''' (holding flagstaff with back facing camera). A portion of the color film shot by Sgt. [[Bill Genaust]], USMC, excerpted from the 1945 "Carriers Hit Tokyo" newsreel]]

On February 19, 1945, Block landed with the Second Battalion, 28th Marines who were nearest to Mount Suribachi at the southern end of Iwo Jima which was the battalion's objective, and fought in the battle for the capture of the island. On February 23, a 40-man patrol from mostly Third Platoon, Easy Company, was sent up Mount Suribachi to seize and occupy the crest and raise an American flag to signal that the mountaintop was captured. The patrol led by First Lieutenant [[Harold G. Schrier|Harold Schrier]] who carried the battalion's flag, left 8 AM and soon made it to the top of Mount Suribachi. The flag was raised by Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sergeant [[Ernest Ivy Thomas, Jr.|Ernest Thomas]], and Sergeant [[Henry Oliver Hansen|Henry Hansen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruralfloridaliving.blogspot.com/2012/07/famous-floridian-friday-ernest-ivy.html] Rural Florida Living. Thomas was interviewed by CBS radio broadcaster Dan Pryor on February 25, 1945, aboard the [[USS Eldorado (AGC-11)]]: "''Three of us actually raised the flag''".&lt;/ref&gt;  After a brief firefight with Japanese soldiers who were hiding in caves after the flag was raised, the summit was secured.

It was determined that the flag was too small to be seen on the north side of Mount Suribachi (where most of the Japanese were located and heavier fighting would occur), so another, larger flag was called for. At around noon or so, Marine Sgt. [[Michael Strank]] was ordered to take three of his squad members in Second Platoon up to the top of Suribachi with supplies and raise a replacement flag. He then chose Cpl. Block (assistant squad leader), Pfc. [[Ira Hayes]], and Pfc. [[Franklin Sousley]] to go with him up the mountain. Pfc. [[Rene Gagnon]], the Easy Company runner (messenger), was ordered to take the flag up and return with the first flag.

Once on top, Strank told Hayes and Sousley to find a pipe to be used for a flagpole to tie the flag on. The flag was attached to a Japanese steel pipe they found, and as the four Marines were about to raise the flagstaff, Strank called for help from Gagnon and Pfc. [[Harold Schultz]] (Navy corpsman [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]] was incorrectly identified as a flag-raiser until June 23, 2016)&lt;ref name="marines.mil"&gt;[http://www.marines.mil/News/News-Display/Article/810457/usmc-statement-on-iwo-jima-flagraisers/ USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers], Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The six Marines then raised the replacement flag together as the first flag and flagstaff was lowered under Lt. Schrier's command. The second raising was immortalized forever by the black and white photo of the flag raising by [[Joe Rosenthal]] of the [[Associated Press]]. This flag-raising was also filmed in color by Sergeant [[Bill Genaust]] who was [[killed in action]] on March 4. Strank was killed in action on March 1, and Sousley on March 21, five days before the battle ended on March 26.

==== Death ====
According to the book ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] (son of Navy corpsman John Bradley), Block then assumed command of Strank's squad in Second Platoon after Strank was killed on March 1, and later the same day Block was mortally wounded by an enemy [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] round explosion while leading the squad during an attack toward Nishi Ridge. Block's last words were, "They killed me!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=James|title=Flags of Our Fathers|date=May 2000|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0-553589-34-2|pages=232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ralph Griffiths, a member of the same platoon as Block, claimed that Strank and Block were killed instantly by the same shell which wounded him on March 1.&lt;ref&gt;[https://taishawalker.wordpress.com/2012/11/12/iwo-jima-survivor-recalls-the-bloody-war/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://listen.sdpb.org/post/marine-veterans-recall-iwo-jima#stream/0]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vindy.com/news/2009/nov/14/veteran-of-easy-company-recalls-rigors-of-iwo-jima/?print]&lt;/ref&gt; Block was originally buried in the 5th Marine Division Cemetery on Iwo Jima in 1945. A service was held there on March 26 which included Hayes and other members of Easy Company. In January 1949, Block's remains was re-interred in Weslaco, Texas. In 1995, his body was moved to a burial place at the [[Marine Military Academy]] near its Iwo Jima monument in [[Harlingen, Texas]].&lt;ref name=TSHA&gt;{{cite web|title=Block, Harlon Henry|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbl52|website=The Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|18154|accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flag raising controversy ==
[[File:Raising the Flag outline.svg|thumb|right|A photo to show the identities of the six second flag-raisers on Mt. Suribachi]]
A controversy arose as to the identity of the person shown at the right end and bottom of the flagstaff in the famous photograph of the second flag-raising on Mount Suribachi. When Block's mother first viewed Rosenthal's iconic photograph of the second flag-raising in the Weslaco newspaper on February 25, 1945, just two days after the photo was taken, she immediately exclaimed, "That's Harlon", pointing to the flag-raiser on the far right. She never wavered in her belief that it was Harlon in the photo, insisting, "I know my boy."

On March 27, 1945, the 28th Marines departed Iwo Jima for Hawaii. On March 30, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] ordered the Marine Corps to send the flag-raisers in Rosenthal's photograph to Washington, D.C. where it was determined that Hansen was in the photograph. On April 7, [[Rene Gagnon]] (Easy Company's runner (messenger)), mistakenly identified the person in the photograph as Sergeant [[Henry O. Hansen|Hank Hansen]] of [[Boston]] (Hansen was a member of Third Platoon of Company E, who had participated in the first flag-raising on Mount Suribachi earlier that morning).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruralfloridaliving.blogspot.com/2012/07/famous-floridian-friday-ernest-ivy.html] Rural Florida Living. CBS Radio interview by Dan Pryor with flag raiser Ernest "Boots" Thomas on February 25, 1945 aboard the [[USS Eldorado (AGC-11)]]: "''Three of us actually raised the flag''"&lt;/ref&gt; On April 8, the Marine Corps released publicly the names of the six flag-raisers in the photograph which were identified by Gagnon (he also incorrectly identified Bradley in the photograph).&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt; When Navy corpsman John Bradley (Third Platoon corpsman, Easy Company, who was involved with the first flag-raising on Suribachi) arrived in Washington, D.C. a few days later, Bradley (he incorrectly identified himself in the photograph)&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt; concurred with Gagnon that Hansen was in the photograph. However, on April 19, when Ira Hayes (Second Platoon) arrived in Washington, D.C., he told the lieutenant colonel interviewing him (also interviewed Gagnon and Bradley) about who the flag-raisers were, that an "error" was made, Block (Second Platoon) and not Hansen was at the base of the flagstaff in the photo. Hayes (who incorrectly identified Bradley in the photograph)&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt; was then told the six names were already released and since Block and Hansen were both deceased, to not say a word about it again&lt;ref&gt;[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]]. ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;(the lt. colonel later claimed Hayes never mentioned Block's name to him).

In 1946, after Hayes was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps (December 1945), he visited Mr. Block at his home and told him Harlon was in the photograph. Mrs. Block then persuaded Mr. Block to write their congressman about the matter which he did in September, and the Marine Corps replied that an investigation would be held by them into the identities of the second flag-raisers in the Rosenthal photograph. During the following investigation, Hayes's written statements and letter to Mrs. Block in September 1945, were instrumental in proving Harlon Block was in the famous photograph and Hansen was not (Hayes, and Hansen who wore parachutist boots on Suribachi... were former [[Paramarines]]). Gagnon and Bradley who said it was Hansen, agreed that "it could be Block" after learning why Hayes said it was Block. The investigation which began in December and concluded in January 1947, found that it was indeed Block and not Hansen in the picture, and that no blame was to be placed on anyone in this matter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3547">'''Headspace technology''' is a technique developed in the 1980s to elucidate the odor compounds present in the air surrounding various objects.  Usually the objects of interest are odoriferous objects such as plants, flowers and foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Omar|first=Jone|last2=Olivares|first2=Maitane|last3=Alonso|first3=Ibone|last4=Vallejo|first4=Asier|last5=Aizpurua-Olaizola|first5=Oier|last6=Etxebarria|first6=Nestor|date=2016-04-01|title=Quantitative Analysis of Bioactive Compounds from Aromatic Plants by Means of Dynamic Headspace Extraction and Multiple Headspace Extraction-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1750-3841.13257/abstract|journal=Journal of Food Science|language=en|volume=81|issue=4|pages=C867–C873|doi=10.1111/1750-3841.13257|issn=1750-3841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar techniques are also used to analyze the interesting scents of locations and environments such as tea shops and saw mills. After the data is analyzed, the scents can then be recreated by a [[perfumer]].

One of the early pioneers of this technology includes [[Roman Kaiser]] who used it to measure and characterize the scents of tropical rainforest. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Roman |last=Kaiser |title=Environmental Scents at the Ligurian Coast |journal=Perfumer &amp; Flavorist |year=1997 |volume=22 |pages=7–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headspace techniques have since been used extensively to sample [[in vivo]] floral headspace of a large variety of numerous taxa and their aromatic compounds such as [[fatty acid]] derivatives ([[aldehyde]]s, [[alcohol]]s and [[ketone]]s), [[benzenoid]]s and [[isoprenoids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Jette T. |last=Knudsen|first2=Lars |last2=Tollsten|first3=L.Gunnar |last3=Bergström |title=Floral scents—a checklist of volatile compounds isolated by head-space techniques |journal=Phytochemistry |year=1993 |volume=33 |number=2 |pages=253–280 |doi=10.1016/0031-9422(93)85502-i}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
The headspace equipment involves a hollow dome or sphere-like objects which forms an airtight seal and surrounds the objects of interest. Inert gases are passed into the space containing the object or a vacuum is established such that the odor compounds are removed from the headspace.&lt;ref name=Jenner&gt;{{cite book | title = The Chemistry of Fragrances | first = Sell| last = Charles (Ed.) |author2=Karen Jenner| chapter = Chapter 14.

The samples can then be analyzed using techniques such as [[gas chromatography]], [[mass spectrometry]], or Carbon-13 [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]].&lt;ref name=Clery&gt;{{cite book | title = The Chemistry of Fragrances | first = Sell| last = Charles (Ed.) |author2=Robin Clery | chapter = Chapter 12.

Several companies have patented similar headspace technologies:
*Aromascope ([[Takasago International Corporation|Takasago]])
*Jungle Essence ([[Mane SA|Mane]])
*NaturePrint ([[Firmenich]])
*ScentTrek ([[Givaudan]])

== Autobiography ==

In Spring of 2008, ghostwriter Ken Scott was introduced to Horace Greasley, aged 89, so he could finally have his World War II memoirs recorded. Scott stated that he only acted as Horace's fingers to type the book as Horace suffered from extreme arthritis.&lt;ref name="Greasley, Horace 2008"&gt;Greasley, Horace (2008). Do the Birds Still Sing in Hell?. Libros International. pp. Synopsis. {{ISBN|978-1905988808}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was finished and published by the end of 2008 by Libros International, and gives Greasley's account of his decision to go to war, his capture, struggles, near-death experiences, brutality of the SS, the unique love of Rosa Rauchbach, the escapes, and his liberation.&lt;ref name="Greasley, Horace 2008"/&gt;

Guy Walters has criticised the book for exaggerating the dangers which Greasley faced stating, "Working camps for NCOs such as Greasley were not the tightly-guarded places conjured up by our collective imagination, which is weaned on images from [[Colditz Castle#Use as POW camp|Colditz]] and [[Stalag Luft III|The Great Escape]]. In fact, bunking out of one's camp to fraternise with local girls was hardly unusual, and certainly not 'escaping' in the sense most of us understand it."&lt;ref name="DailyMail" /&gt;

==Himmler photograph==
[[File:Himmler inspects POW camp.jpg|thumb|right|The disputed photograph, claimed by some to include Greasley]]

[[Guy Walters]] asserted categorically that the soldier in the picture was not Greasley, stating that the picture is held by the US National Archives and the caption details show it was taken in Minsk (in Belarus) in mid-1941, that it was taken by a photographer for a propaganda film and identifies the soldier as Soviet from his cap, and that the officers in the picture are the same officers who appear in the film with Himmler.&lt;ref name="leicestermercury.co.uk"/&gt;

KTOrg is probably best known for the controversial [[politics|political]] art works created by its founder, Filip Filkovic. Filkovic was also involved in the making of art pieces for the [[Cautese Nationál Postal Disservice]] project founded by [[James Cauty]] of [[The KLF]]. Together with Cauty, Filkovic created some of the works in 2007 and 2008 until the final closure of CNPD. According to the official website of Kunstterrorist Organisation, all the works ever created and published via their web shop hold direct reference to popular culture via [[dystopian]] and [[counterculture]] themes, and also directly criticizes the world government's policies and the erosion of [[Political freedom|freedom]]. Along with limited edition printed works, Filkovic also produces [[Cinderella stamp]] artwork. During the C2 exhibition in [[Zagreb]] in 2008, Filkovic published a number of highly controversial works which reflected the popular culture and criticised Croatian high officials. His work "iVo", which features Croatian prime minister [[Ivo Sanader]] wearing [[iPod]] headphones, was a well-discussed work in the media and gathered a number of positive reactions. In addition to "iVo" as an artwork, KTOrg announced that "iVo" (now a fictional character in the fictional monarchy "Counterculture Monarchy of Discordianism") was to be elected president of the monarchy. For that purpose, a fictional website was set up at www.ivoforpresident.com.

==Multimedia activism==
Along with [[guerilla activism]], members of KTOrg are involved in music production, known as "Kunstterrorist Audio Noize". The audio tracks are released via the British anti-label [[Death to Music]]. The band consists of six members and the music varies in genre from [[electronica]] to [[punk music|punk]]/[[rock music|rock]] and [[Gabber|gabba]]. The members of Kunstterrorist Audio Noize also created a number of remixes for other bands.

==Characteristics==
KTOrg is influenced by and constantly references the [[culture jamming]] movement in art, activism and music. The organisation also strongly supports [[Copyleft]] and [[Free Culture Movement]] and apparently (according to their official web site) is giving away everything it has ever created for free on December 12, 2012. KTOrg's work also references [[discordianism]] as a major influence. The discordianism references are most obvious in the organization's frequent newsletters and the information given on its official web page.

'''''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon''''' ('''''The Young Ladies of Avignon''''', and originally titled '''''The Brothel of Avignon''''')&lt;ref name="Richardson91p19"/&gt; is a large oil painting created in 1907 by the Spanish artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. The work, part of the permanent collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], portrays five nude female [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] from a [[brothel]] on Carrer d'Avinyó (Avignon Street) in [[Barcelona]]. Each figure is depicted in a disconcerting confrontational manner and none is conventionally [[Femininity|feminine]]. The women appear as slightly menacing and rendered with angular and disjointed body shapes. Three figures on the left exhibit facial features in the [[Iberians|Iberian]] style of Picasso's native Spain, while the two on the right are shown with [[African traditional masks|African mask-like]] features. The [[Race (human classification)|racial]] [[Primitivism]] evoked in these masks, according to Picasso, moved him to "liberate an utterly original artistic style of compelling, even savage force."&lt;ref&gt;Sam Hunter and John Jacobus, ''Modern Art'', Prentice-Hall, New York, 1977, pp. 135–136&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_OCk5D-2rfYC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=%22Les+Demoiselles+d%27Avignon%22+%22savage%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hVSHVPiYGIu7UfvTgoAG&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Les%20Demoiselles%20d'Avignon%22%20%22savage%22&amp;f=false Gina M.

In this adaptation of Primitivism and abandonment of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] in favor of a flat, two-dimensional [[picture plane]], Picasso makes a radical departure from traditional European painting. This [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] work is widely considered to be seminal in the early development of both [[Cubism]] and [[Modern art]].

''Les Demoiselles'' was revolutionary and controversial, and led to widespread anger and disagreement, even amongst the painter's closest associates and friends. Matisse considered the work something of a bad joke, yet indirectly reacted to it in his 1908 ''[[Bathers with a Turtle]]''. Braque too initially disliked the painting, yet perhaps more than anyone else, studied the work in great detail. And effectively, his subsequent friendship and collaboration with Picasso led to the Cubist revolution.&lt;ref name="Visions of the Modern" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U_10BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=reaction+to+Les+Demoiselles+d%27Avignon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=teKKVN24LoLUOJTzgZgF&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Emily Braun, Rebecca Rabinow, ''Cubism: The Leonard A. Lauder Collection''], Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2014, {{ISBN|0300208073}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its resemblance to [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]'s ''[[The Bathers (Cézanne)|Les Grandes Baigneuses]],'' [[Paul Gauguin]]'s statue ''[[Oviri]]'' and [[El Greco]]'s ''[[Opening of the Fifth Seal]]'' has been widely discussed by later critics.

At the time of its first exhibition in 1916, the painting was deemed immoral.&lt;ref name="Green, Courtauld"&gt;[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805215/83671/sample/9780521583671ws.pdf ''Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon''], edited by Christopher Green, Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London, Cambridge University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The work, painted in Picasso's studio at [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] in [[Montmartre]], Paris, was seen publicly for the first time at the Salon d'Antin in July 1916, at an exhibition organized by the poet [[André Salmon]]. It was at this exhibition that Salmon, who had already mentioned the painting in 1912 under the title ''Le Bordel philosophique'', gave the work its present title ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' (in preference to the title originally chosen by Picasso, ''Le Bordel d'Avignon'') to lessen its scandalous impact on the public.&lt;ref name="Richardson91p19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Visions of the Modern"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d5wXeMFxA2IC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=matisse+reaction+Les+Demoiselles+d%27Avignon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UeiKVI6HA4jjaP_IgsgD&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Demoiselles&amp;f=false John Golding, ''Visions of the Modern''], University of California Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0520087925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name="archivesdefrance"&gt;[http://www.archivesdefrance.culture.gouv.fr/action-culturelle/celebrations-nationales/2007/arts/les-demoiselles-d-avignon-pablo-picasso Archives de France, ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, Pablo Picasso'', 2007 (French)]&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso, who had always referred to it as ''mon bordel (my brothel)'',&lt;ref name="Green, Courtauld" /&gt; or ''Le Bordel d'Avignon'',&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; never liked Salmon's title, and as an [[wikt:edulcoration|edulcoration]] would have preferred ''Las chicas de Avignon'' instead.&lt;ref name="Richardson91p19"/&gt;

==Background and development==
[[File:Paul Cézanne 014.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''Bather,'' 1885–87, [[Museum of Modern Art]], formerly collection [[Lillie P. Bliss]]]]

Picasso came into his own as an important artist during the first decade of the 20th century. He arrived in Paris from Spain around the turn of the century as a young, ambitious painter out to make a name for himself. Although he eventually left most of his friends, relatives and contacts in Spain, he continued to live and paint in Spain while making regular trips back to France. For several years he alternated between living and working in Barcelona, Madrid and the Spanish countryside, and made frequent trips to Paris.

By 1904, he was fully settled in Paris and had established several studios, important relationships with both friends and colleagues. Between 1901 and 1904, Picasso began to achieve recognition for his [[Picasso's Blue Period|Blue period]] paintings. In the main these were studies of poverty and desperation based on scenes he had seen in Spain and Paris at the turn of the century. Subjects included gaunt families, blind figures, and personal encounters; other paintings depicted his friends, but most reflected and expressed a sense of [[Depression (mood)|blueness]] and despair.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=4609 Melissa McQuillan, ''Pablo Picasso'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

He followed his success by developing into his [[Picasso's Rose Period|Rose period]] from 1904 to 1907, which introduced a strong element of sensuality and sexuality into his work. The Rose period depictions of acrobats, circus performers and theatrical characters are rendered in warmer, brighter colors and are far more hopeful and joyful in their depictions of the bohemian life in the Parisian [[avant-garde]] and its environs. The Rose period produced two important large masterpieces: ''Family of Saltimbanques'' (1905), which recalls the work of [[Gustave Courbet]] (1819–1877) and [[Édouard Manet]] (1832–1883); and ''[[Boy Leading a Horse]]'' (1905–06), which recalls [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]'s ''Bather'' (1885–87) and [[El Greco]]'s ''Saint Martin and the Beggar'' (1597–1599). While he already had a considerable following by the middle of 1906, Picasso enjoyed further success with his paintings of massive oversized nude women, monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of [[Paul Gauguin]] and showed his interest in primitive (African, [[Micronesia]]n, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]) art. He began exhibiting his work in the galleries of [[Berthe Weill]] (1865–1951) and [[Ambroise Vollard]] (1866–1939), quickly gaining a growing reputation and a following amongst the artistic communities of [[Montmartre]] and [[Montparnasse]].&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

Picasso became a favorite of the American art collectors [[Gertrude Stein]] and her brother [[Leo Stein|Leo]] around 1905. The Steins' older brother Michael and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work. Picasso painted portraits of both Gertrude Stein and her nephew [[Allan Stein]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.duvarpaper.com/main.php?g2_itemId=4883 Picasso Portrait de Allan Stein.

Retrieved 27 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gertrude Stein began acquiring Picasso's drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal ''Salon'' at her home in Paris. At one of her gatherings in 1905 he met [[Henri Matisse]] (1869–1954), who was to become in those days his chief rival, although in later years a close friend. The Steins introduced Picasso to [[Claribel Cone]] (1864–1929), and her sister [[Etta Cone]] (1870–1949), also American art collectors, who began to acquire Picasso and Matisse's paintings. Eventually Leo Stein moved to Italy, and Michael and Sarah Stein became important patrons of Matisse, while Gertrude Stein continued to collect Picasso.&lt;ref&gt;Mellow, James R.

==Rivalry with Matisse==
[[File:Bonheur Matisse.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'' (1905–06), oil on canvas, 175 × 241 cm. [[Barnes Foundation]], [[Merion, PA]]. A painting that was called Fauvist and brought Matisse both public derision and notoriety. [[Hilton Kramer]] wrote: "owing to its long sequestration in the collection of the Barnes Foundation, which never permitted its reproduction in color, it is the least familiar of modern masterpieces. Yet this painting was Matisse's own response to the hostility his work had met with in the Salon d'Automne of 1905."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilton Kramer|Kramer, Hilton]]. ''The Triumph of Modernism'': The Art World, 1985–2005, 2006, ''Reflections on Matisse,'' p. 162, {{ISBN|0-15-666370-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:Rousseau-Hungry-Lion.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Henri Rousseau]], ''[[The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope]]'', 1905, was the reason for the term [[Fauvism]], and the original "Wild Beast"]]

The [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905 brought notoriety and attention to the works of Henri Matisse and the [[Fauvism|Les Fauves]] group. The latter gained their name after critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] described their work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"),&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

[http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/fauvism ''Fauvism''], The Oxford Dictionary of Art, Oxford University Press, 2004. 26 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Rousseau]] (1844–1910), an artist that Picasso knew and admired and who was not a Fauve, had his large [[jungle]] scene ''[[The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope]]'' also hanging near the works by Matisse and which may have had an influence on the particular [[Sarcasm|sarcastic]] term used in the press.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Roberta.

Although the pictures were widely derided—"A pot of paint has been flung in the face of the public", declared the critic [[Camille Mauclair]] (1872–1945)—they also attracted some favorable attention.&lt;ref name=oup-fauvism/&gt; The painting that was singled out for the most attacks was Matisse's ''[[Woman with a Hat]]''; the purchase of this work by [[Gertrude Stein|Gertrude]] and [[Leo Stein]] had a very positive effect on Matisse, who was suffering demoralization from the bad reception of his work.&lt;ref name=oup-fauvism/&gt;

Matisse's notoriety and preeminence as the leader of the new movement in modern painting continued to build throughout 1906 and 1907, and Matisse attracted a following of artists including [[Georges Braque]] (1880–1963), [[André Derain]] (1880–1954), [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] (1876–1958). Picasso's work had passed through his [[Picasso's Blue Period|Blue period]] and his [[Picasso's Rose Period|Rose period]] and while he had a considerable following his reputation was tame in comparison to his rival Matisse. To make matters worse Matisse shocked the French public again at the 1907 [[Société des Artistes Indépendants]] when he exhibited his painting ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)|Blue Nude]],'' completed in early 1907. The ''Blue Nude'' was one of the paintings that would later create an international sensation at the [[Armory Show of 1913]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;''Matisse, Henri''. Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online. Retrieved 30 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the spring of 1907 when he began to paint ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'', until its completion later in the year, Picasso was vying with Matisse for the preeminent position of being the perceived new leader of Modern painting. Upon its completion the shock and the impact of the painting propelled Picasso into the center of controversy and all but knocked Matisse and Fauvism off the map, virtually ending the movement by the following year. In 1907 Picasso joined the art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]] (1884–1979). Kahnweiler was a German art historian, art collector who became one of the premier French [[art dealer]]s of the 20th century. He became prominent in Paris beginning in 1907 for being among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, and especially his painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.'' Before 1910 Picasso was already being recognized as one of the important leaders of Modern art alongside Henri Matisse who had been the undisputed leader of [[Fauvism]] and who was more than ten years older than he was and his contemporaries the Fauvist [[André Derain]] and the former [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] and fellow [[Cubist]], [[Georges Braque]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/ext/resources/news/2016/02-Feb/wild-men-of-paris-architectural-record-may-1910.pdf "The Wild Men of Paris"]. The ''[[Architectural Record]]'', July 2002 (PDF). Retrieved 15 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1992 essay ''Reflections on Matisse'', the art critic [[Hilton Kramer]] wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;After the impact of ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'', however, Matisse was never again mistaken for an avant-garde incendiary. With the bizarre painting that appalled and electrified the [[Connoisseur|cognoscenti]], which understood the ''Les Demoiselles'' was at once a response to Matisse's ''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'' (1905–1906) and an assault upon the tradition from which it derived, Picasso effectively appropriated the role of avant-garde ''wild beast''—a role that, as far as public opinion was concerned, he was never to relinquish.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilton Kramer|Kramer, Hilton]]. "The Triumph of Modernism: The Art World, 1985–2005, 2006". ''Reflections on Matisse''. 162. {{ISBN|0-15-666370-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kramer goes on to say,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas Matisse had drawn upon a long tradition of European painting—from [[Giorgione]], [[Poussin]], and [[Watteau]] to [[Ingres]], [[Cézanne]], and [[Gauguin]]—to create a modern version of a pastoral paradise in ''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'', Picasso had turned to an alien tradition of [[primitive art]] to create in ''Les Demoiselles'' a netherworld of strange gods and violent emotions. As between the mythological nymphs of ''Le bonheur de vivre'' and the grotesque effigies of ''Les Demoiselles,'' there was no question as to which was the more shocking or more intended to be shocking. Picasso had unleashed a vein of feeling that was to have immense consequences for the art and culture of the modern era while Matisse's ambition came to seem, as he said in his ''Notes of a Painter,'' more ''limited''—limited that is, to the realm of aesthetic pleasure. There was thus opened up, in the very first decade of the century and in the work of its two greatest artists, the chasm that has continued to divide the art of the modern era down to our own time.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, pp.162–163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been argued that the painting was a reaction to [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''[[Le bonheur de vivre]]'' and ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)|Blue Nude]]''.&lt;ref name="archivesdefrance" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilton Kramer|Kramer, Hilton]]. ''Reflections on Matisse''. [[The New Criterion]], November 1992, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==

Painted in Paris during the summer of 1907, Picasso had created hundreds of sketches and studies in preparation for the final work.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richardson 1991, 43"&gt;Richardson 1991, 43&lt;/ref&gt; He long acknowledged the importance of [[Spanish art]] and [[Iberian sculpture]] as influences on the painting. The work is believed by critics to be influenced by African tribal masks and the [[art of Oceania]], although Picasso denied the connection; many art historians remain skeptical about his denials. Several experts maintain that, at the very least, Picasso visited the [[Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro]] (known today as [[Musée de l'Homme]]) in the spring of 1907 where he saw and was unconsciously influenced by African and Tribal art several months before completing ''Les Demoiselles.''&lt;ref&gt;[[John Richardson (art historian)|Richardson, John]].

In 1907, when Picasso began to work on ''Les Demoiselles'', one of the old master painters he greatly admired was [[El Greco]] (1541–1614). At the time El Greco was largely obscure and under-appreciated. Picasso's friend [[Ignacio Zuloaga]] (1870–1945) acquired El Greco's masterpiece, the ''[[Opening of the Fifth Seal]]'', in 1897 for 1000 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/european_paintings/the_vision_of_saint_john/objectView.aspx?&amp;OID=110001018&amp;collID=11&amp;vw=0 The Vision of Saint John]". [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 18 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; While Picasso was working on ''Les Demoiselles'', he visited his friend [[Ignacio Zuloaga]] in his studio in Paris and studied El Greco's ''Opening of the Fifth Seal.''&lt;ref&gt;Horsley, Carter B. ''[http://www.thecityreview.com/elgreco.html The Shock of the Old]''. The City Review, 2003. Retrieved 2 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' and the ''Opening of the Fifth Seal'' was pinpointed in the early 1980s, when the [[Painting style|stylistic similarities]] and the relationship between the [[Iconography|motifs]] and [[Motif (visual arts)|visually identifying]] qualities of both works were analyzed.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, ''Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon and the Theater of the Absurd''. 102–113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J. ''Picasso's Apocalyptic Whorehouse''. 40–47&lt;/ref&gt;

El Greco's painting, which Picasso studied repeatedly in Zuloaga's house, inspired not only the size, format, and composition of ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'', but it inspired its apocalyptic power.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, 430&lt;/ref&gt; Later, speaking of the work to Dor de la Souchère in Antibes, Picasso said: "In any case, only the execution counts. From this point of view, it is correct to say that Cubism has a Spanish origin and that I invented Cubism. We must look for the Spanish influence in Cézanne. Things themselves necessitate it, the influence of El Greco, a Venetian painter, on him. But his structure is Cubist."&lt;ref name="Souchère15"&gt;D. de la Souchère, ''Picasso à Antibes'', 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship of the painting to other group portraits in the Western tradition, such as ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' by [[Titian]] (1488–1576), and the same subject by [[Rubens]] (1577–1640), in the [[Prado]], has also been discussed.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cézanne and Cubism===
[[File:Paul Cézanne 047.jpg|thumb|340px|[[Paul Cézanne]]'s ''[[The Bathers (Cézanne)|Les Grandes Baigneuses]]'' (1906, oil on canvas, 210.5 × 250.8&amp;nbsp;cm., 82{{fraction|7|8}} × 98{{fraction|3|4}} inches, [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]) is generally believed to be a likely inspiration for ''Les Demoiselles''.]]

Both [[Paul Gauguin]] (1848–1903) and [[Paul Cézanne]] (1839–1906) were accorded major posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris between 1903 and 1907, and both were important influences on Picasso and instrumental to his creation of ''Les Demoiselles.'' According to the English art historian, collector and author of ''The Cubist Epoch'', [[Douglas Cooper (art historian)|Douglas Cooper]], both of those artists were particularly influential to the formation of [[Cubism]] and especially important to the paintings of Picasso during 1906 and 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 20&amp;ndash;27&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper goes on to say however ''Les Demoiselles'' is often erroneously referred to as the first Cubist painting. He explains,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Demoiselles'' is generally referred to as the first Cubist picture. This is an exaggeration, for although it was a major first step towards Cubism it is not yet Cubist. The disruptive, expressionist element in it is even contrary to the spirit of Cubism, which looked at the world in a detached, realistic spirit. Nevertheless, the ''Demoiselles'' is the logical picture to take as the starting point for Cubism, because it marks the birth of a new pictorial idiom, because in it Picasso violently overturned established conventions and because all that followed grew out of it.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although not well known to the general public prior to 1906, Cézanne's reputation was highly regarded in [[avant-garde]] circles, as evidenced by [[Ambroise Vollard]]'s interest in showing and collecting his work, and by [[Leo Stein]]'s interest. Picasso was familiar with much of Cézanne's work that he saw at Vollard's gallery and at the Stein's. After Cézanne died in 1906, his paintings were exhibited in Paris in a large scale museum-like retrospective in September 1907. The 1907 Cézanne retrospective at the [[Salon d'Automne]] greatly impacted the direction that the avant-garde in Paris took, lending credence to his position as one of the most influential artists of the 19th century and to the advent of Cubism. The 1907 Cézanne exhibition was enormously influential in establishing Cézanne as an important painter whose ideas were particularly resonant especially to young artists in Paris.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Joann Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist works, 1904–1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press 1985, pp. 34-42&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Picasso and Braque found the inspiration for their [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] works in Paul Cézanne, who said to observe and learn to see and treat nature as if it were composed of basic shapes like ''cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones.'' Cézanne's explorations of geometric simplification and optical phenomena inspired [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Jean Metzinger|Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes|Gleizes]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier|Le Fauconnier]], [[Juan Gris|Gris]] and others to experiment with ever more complex multiple views of the same subject, and, eventually to the fracturing of form. Cézanne thus sparked one of the most revolutionary areas of artistic enquiry of the 20th century, one which was to affect profoundly the development of [[modern art]].&lt;ref name="Joann Moser" /&gt;

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the European cultural elite were discovering [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]], [[Oceanic art|Oceanic]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] art. Artists such as [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Henri Matisse]] and Picasso were intrigued and inspired by the stark power and simplicity of styles of those cultures. Around 1906, Picasso, Matisse, [[André Derain|Derain]] and other artists in Paris had acquired an interest in primitivism, [[Iberian sculpture]],&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 27&lt;/ref&gt; [[African art]] and [[African tribal masks|tribal masks]], in part because of the compelling works of Paul Gauguin that had suddenly achieved center stage in the avant-garde circles of Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris in 1903&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cataloguedesouvr1903salo#page/68/mode/2up Gauguin at the Salon d'Automne, 1903]&lt;/ref&gt; and an even larger one in 1906&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cataloguedesouvr1906salo#page/190/mode/2up Gauguin retrospective at the Salon d'Automne, 1906]&lt;/ref&gt; had a stunning and powerful influence on Picasso's paintings.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

In the autumn of 1906, Picasso followed his previous successes with paintings of oversized nude women, and monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of Paul Gauguin and showed his interest in primitive art. Pablo Picasso's paintings of massive figures from 1906 were directly influenced by Gauguin's sculpture, painting and his writing as well. The savage power evoked by Gauguin's work lead directly to ''Les Demoiselles'' in 1907.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

According to Gauguin biographer [[David Sweetman]], Pablo Picasso as early as 1902 became an aficionado of Gauguin's work when he met and befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio (1875–1940), in Paris. Durrio had several of Gauguin's works on hand because he was a friend of Gauguin's and an unpaid agent of his work. Durrio tried to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris. After they met Durrio introduced Picasso to Gauguin's stoneware, helped Picasso make some ceramic pieces and gave Picasso a first ''La Plume'' edition of ''Noa Noa: The Tahiti Journal of Paul Gauguin.''&lt;ref&gt;Sweetman, 563&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning Gauguin's impact on Picasso, art historian [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The 1906 exhibition of Gauguin's work left Picasso more than ever in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a new source of divine energy. If in later years Picasso played down his debt to Gauguin, there is no doubt that between 1905 and 1907 he felt a very close kinship with this other Paul, who prided himself on Spanish genes inherited from his Peruvian grandmother. Had not Picasso signed himself 'Paul' in Gauguin's honor.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, 461&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both David Sweetman and John Richardson point to Gauguin's ''[[Oviri (Gauguin)|Oviri]]'' (literally meaning 'savage'), a gruesome phallic representation of the Tahitian goddess of life and death intended for Gauguin's grave. First exhibited in the 1906 retrospective, it was likely a direct influence on ''Les Demoiselles.'' Sweetman writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Gauguin's statue ''Oviri'', which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in print-making, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon''.&lt;ref&gt;Sweetman, 562–563&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Richardson,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Picasso's interest in [[stoneware]] was further stimulated by the examples he saw at the 1906 Gauguin retrospective at the Salon d'Automne. The most disturbing of those ceramics (one that Picasso might have already seen at Vollard's) was the gruesome ''Oviri.'' Until 1987, when the [[Musée d'Orsay]] acquired this little-known work (exhibited only once since 1906) it had never been recognized as the masterpiece it is, let alone recognized for its relevance to the works leading up to the ''Demoiselles.'' Although just under 30 inches high, ''Oviri'' has an awesome presence, as befits a monument intended for Gauguin's grave. Picasso was very struck by ''Oviri.'' 50 years later he was delighted when [Douglas] Cooper and I told him that we had come upon this sculpture in a collection that also included the original plaster of his Cubist head. Has it been a revelation, like Iberian sculpture? Picasso's shrug was grudgingly affirmative. He was always loath to admit Gauguin's role in setting him on the road to primitivism.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, 459&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Europe's [[Colonisation of Africa|colonization of Africa]] led to many economic, social, political, and even artistic encounters. From these encounters, Western visual artists became increasingly interested in the unique forms of African art, particularly masks from the Niger-Congo region. In an essay by Dennis Duerden, author of ''African Art'' (1968), ''The Invisible Present'' (1972), and a former director of the [[BBC World Service]], the mask is defined as "very often a complete head-dress and not just that part that conceals the face".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The "Discovery" of the African Mask|last = Duerden|first = Dennis|publisher = |year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = 29–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of visual art and image appealed to Western visual artists, leading to what Duerden calls the "discovery" of African art by Western practitioners, including Picasso.

The stylistic sources for the heads of the women and their degree of influence has been much discussed and debated, in particular the influence of [[African tribal masks]], [[art of Oceania]],&lt;ref&gt;Green is careful to use the two terms together throughout his discussion, 49–59&lt;/ref&gt; and pre-Roman Iberian sculptures. The rounded contours of the features of the three women to the left can be related to [[Iberian sculpture]], but not obviously the fragmented planes of the two on the right, which indeed seem influenced by African masks.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 58–9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Weschler]] says that, &lt;blockquote&gt;in many ways, much of the moldering cultural and even scientific ferment that characterized the first decade and a half of the twentieth century and that laid the foundations for much of what we today consider modern can be traced back to ways in which Europe was already wrestling with its bad-faith, often strenuously repressed, knowledge of what it had been doing in Africa. The example of Picasso virtually launching cubism with his 1907 ''Desmoiselles d’Avignon'', in response to the sorts of African masks and other colonial booty he was encountering in Paris’s Musee de l’Homme, is obvious.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, Picasso emphatically denied the influence of African masks on the painting: "African art? Never heard of it!" (''L'art nègre? Connais pas!''),&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Picasso's words were transcribed by Fels F., "Opinions sur l'art nègre". ''Action'', Paris, 1920; and [[Pierre Daix|Daix, P.]]. "Il n'y a pas d'art nègre dans les Demoiselles d'Avignon". In ''Gazette des Beaux-Arts'' Paris, October 1970. Both are quoted in Anne Baldassari, "''Corpus ethnicum'': Picasso et la photographie coloniale", in ''Zoos humains. De la Vénus hottentote aux reality shows'', Nicolas Bancel, Pascal Blanchard, Gilles Boëtsch, Eric Deroo, Sandrine Lemaire, Edition La Découverte, 2002. 340–348&lt;/ref&gt; asserting instead that the primitivism in his work during, before and after the painting of ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,'' from spring 1906 through the spring of 1907 was primarily influenced by Iberian sculpture.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RichJ"&gt;Richardson 1991, 451&lt;/ref&gt; Some Iberian [[relief]]s from [[Osuna]], then only recently excavated, were on display in the Louvre from 1904. [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] Greek sculpture has also been claimed as an influence.

The influence of Iberian sculpture became an issue in 1939, when [[Alfred Barr]] claimed that the primitivism of the ''Demoiselles'' derived from the art of [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and the French Congo.&lt;ref&gt;Barr 1939, 55&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso insisted that the editor of his "catalogue raissonne", [[Christian Zervos]], publish a disclaimer: the 'Demoiselles,' he said, owed nothing to [[African art]], everything to the reliefs from Osuna that he had seen in the Louvre a year or so before.&lt;ref&gt;Daix, Pierre. "Il n'y a pas d'art nègre dans les Demoiselles d'Avignon". ''Gazette des Beaux Arts'', Paris, October 1970. 247–70&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he is known to have seen African tribal masks while working on the painting, during a visit to the [[Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro|Ethnographic Museum of the Trocadero]] with [[Andre Malraux]] in June 1907, about which he later said "When I went to the Trocadero, it was disgusting. The flea market, the smell. I was all alone. I wanted to get away, but I didn't leave. I stayed, I stayed. I understood that it was very important. Something was happening to me, right. The masks weren't like any other pieces of sculpture, not at all. They were magic things."&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;''[http://www.bbcactive.com/BroadcastLearning/MediaSupportFiles/PLOAM3%20synopsis.pdf The Private Life of a Masterpiece]''. [[BBC]] Series 3, Episode 9. 17, 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, 2005, discusses the visit, and also postcards of African people owned by Picasso. 49–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A magical encounter at the root of modern art". ''The Economist'', 9 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] is often credited with introducing Picasso to African sculpture of [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]] extraction in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards &amp; Wood, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Picasso biographer John Richardson recounts in ''A Life of Picasso, The Cubist Rebel 1907–1916,'' art dealer [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'s recollection of his first visit to Picasso's studio in July 1907. Kahnweiler remembers seeing ''dusty stacks of canvases'' in Picasso's studio and ''African sculptures of majestic severity.'' Richardson comments: ''so much for Picasso's story that he was not yet aware of [[African tribal masks|Tribal art]].''&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, 34&lt;/ref&gt; A photograph of Picasso in his studio surrounded by [[African art|African sculptures]] c.1908, is found on page 27 of that same volume.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

Although ''Les Demoiselles'' had an enormous and profound influence on [[modern art]], its impact was not immediate, and the painting stayed in Picasso's studio for many years. At first, only Picasso's intimate circle of artists, dealers, collectors and friends were aware of the work. While many were shocked and some outraged, influential people such as [[Georges Braque]] and [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]] were supportive. Soon after the late summer of 1907, Picasso and his long-time lover Fernande Olivier (1881–1966) had a parting of the ways. The re-painting of the two heads on the far right of ''Les Demoiselles'' fueled speculation that it was an indication of the split between Picasso and Olivier. Although they later reunited for a period, the relationship ended in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, 47, 228&lt;/ref&gt;

A photograph of the ''Les Demoiselles'' was first published in an article by [[Gelett Burgess]] entitled "The Wild Men of Paris, Matisse, Picasso and Les Fauves", ''The Architectural Record'', May 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11445-the-wild-men-of-paris Gelett Burgess, "The Wild Men of Paris, Matisse, Picasso and Les Fauves", ''The Architectural Record'', May 1910]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Les Demoiselles'' would not be exhibited until 1916, and not widely recognized as a revolutionary achievement until the early 1920s, when [[André Breton]] (1896–1966) published the work.&lt;ref name="Richardson 1991, 43"/&gt; Richardson goes on to say that [[Henri Matisse]] was fighting mad upon seeing the ''Demoiselles'' at Picasso's studio. He let it be known that he regarded the painting as an attempt to ridicule the modern movement; he was outraged to find his sensational ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)|Blue Nude]],'' not to speak of ''[[Le bonheur de vivre|Bonheur de vivre]],'' overtaken by Picasso's "hideous" whores. He vowed to get even and make Picasso beg for mercy. Just as the ''Bonheur de vivre'' had fueled Picasso's competitiveness, ''Les Demoiselles'' now fueled Matisse's.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Picasso's closed circle of friends and colleagues there was a mixture of opinions about ''Les Demoiselles''. [[Georges Braque]] and [[André Derain]] were both initially troubled by it although they were supportive of Picasso. According to [[William Rubin]], two of Picasso's friends, the art critic [[André Salmon]] and the painter [[Ardengo Soffici]] (1879–1964), were enthusiastic about it while [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] (1880–1918) wasn't. Both the art dealer-collector [[Wilhelm Uhde]] (1874–1947), and art dealer [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]] were more enthusiastic about the painting however.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, 43–47&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kahnweiler ''Les Demoiselles'' was the beginning of Cubism. He writes:

{{quote|Early in 1907 Picasso began a strange large painting depicting women, fruit and drapery, which he left unfinished. It cannot be called other than unfinished, even though it represents a long period of work. Begun in the spirit of the works of 1906, it contains in one section the endeavors of 1907 and thus never constitutes a unified whole.

The nudes, with large, quiet eyes, stand rigid, like mannequins. Their stiff, round bodies are flesh-colored, black and white. That is the style of 1906.

In the foreground, however, alien to the style of the rest of the painting, appear a crouching figure and a bowl of fruit. These forms are drawn angularly, not roundly modeled in chiaroscuro. The colors are luscious blue, strident yellow, next to pure black and white. This is the beginning of Cubism, the first upsurge, a desperate titanic clash with all of the problems at once.|Kahweiler, 1920&lt;ref name="Kahnweiler"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/riseofcubism00kahn Daniel Henry Kahnweiler, ''The Rise of Cubism'', New York, Wittenborn, Schultz.

==Public view and title==
From 16 to 31 July 1916 ''Les Demoiselles'' was exhibited to the public for the first time at the [[Salon d'Antin]], an exhibition organized by André Salmon titled ''L'Art moderne en France''. The exhibition space at 26 rue d'Antin was lent by the famous couturier and art collector [[Paul Poiret]]. The larger [[Salon d'Automne]] and [[Salon des Indépendants]] had been closed due to World War I, making this the only Cubists exhibition in France since 1914.&lt;ref name="Bohm-Duchen"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cwL7aF-EB84C&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=%22l'art+moderne+en+france%22,+%22Salon+d'Antin%22,+%22Paul+Poiret%22,+André+Salmon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XMXjJdIOR_&amp;sig=w2iVvIpxdnORyuiZ0UEjI4piC9k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OYQBU_DMIePB7AavgYGIDA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22l'art%20moderne%20en%20france%22%2C%20%22Salon%20d'Antin%22%2C%20%22Paul%20Poiret%22%2C%20André%20Salmon&amp;f=false Monica Bohm-Duchen, ''The Private Life of a Masterpiece'', University of California Press, 2001], {{ISBN|9780520233782}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July 1916 a review was published in ''Le Cri de Paris'':&lt;ref name="Le cri de Paris"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65218498/f1.image ''Lettres &amp; Art, Cubistes'', Le cri de Paris, 23 July 1916, p. 10], A20, No. 1008, Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Cubists are not waiting for the war to end to recommence hostilities against good sense. They are exhibiting at the Galerie Poiret naked women whose scattered parts are represented in all four corners of the canvas: here an eye, there an ear, over there a hand, a foot on top, a mouth below. M. Picasso, their leader, is possibly the least disheveled of the lot. He has painted, or rather daubed, five women who are, if the truth be told, all hacked up, and yet their limbs somehow manage to hold together. They have, moreover, piggish faces with eyes wandering negligently above their ears. An enthusiastic art-lover offered the artist 20,000 francs for this masterpiece. M. Picasso wanted more. The art-lover did not insist.&lt;ref name="Bohm-Duchen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Le cri de Paris" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Picasso referred to his only entry at the Salon d'Antin as his Brothel painting calling it ''Le Bordel d'Avignon'' but André Salmon retitled it ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' so as to lessen its scandalous impact on the public. Picasso never liked the title, however, preferring "las chicas de Avignon", but Salmon's title stuck.&lt;ref name="Richardson91p19"&gt;Richardson 1991, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The only other time the painting might have been exhibited to the public prior to a 1937 showing in New York was in 1918, in an exhibition dedicated to Picasso and Matisse at Galerie Paul Guillaume in Paris, though very little information exists about this exhibition or the presence (if at all) of ''Les Demoiselles''.&lt;ref name="Bohm-Duchen" /&gt;

Afterwards, the painting was rolled up and remained with Picasso until 1924 when, with urging and help from Breton and [[Louis Aragon]] (1897–1982), he sold it to designer [[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]] (1853–1929), for 25,000 francs.&lt;ref&gt;Fluegel, 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franck, 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Picasso drew each of the figures in ''Les Demoiselles'' differently. The woman pulling the curtain on the upper right is rendered with heavy paint. Composed of sharp [[geometric shape]]s, her head is the most strictly Cubist of all five.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, 31&lt;/ref&gt; The curtain seems to blend partially into her body. The Cubist head of the crouching figure (lower right) underwent at least two revisions from an [[Iberians|Iberian]] figure to its current state. She also seems to have been drawn from two different perspectives at once, creating a confusing, twisted figure. The woman above her is rather manly, with a dark face and square chest. The whole picture is in a two-dimensional style, with an abandoned perspective.

Much of the critical debate that has taken place over the years centers on attempting to account for this multiplicity of styles within the work. The dominant understanding for over five decades, espoused most notably by [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.|Alfred Barr]], the first director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and organizer of major career retrospectives for the artist, has been that it can be interpreted as evidence of a transitional period in Picasso's art, an effort to connect his earlier work to Cubism, the style he would help invent and develop over the next five or six years.&lt;ref name=Steinberg&gt;Steinberg, L., ''The Philosophical Brothel''. [[October (journal)|October]], no. 44, Spring 1988. 7–74. First published in ''Art News'' vol. LXXI, September/October 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Art critic [[John Berger]], in his controversial 1965 biography ''The Success and Failure of Picasso'',&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Success and Failure of Picasso|year=1965|publisher=Penguin Books, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-679-73725-4 |pages=73–77|author=Berger, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; interprets ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' as the provocation that led to Cubism:

{{quote|Blunted by the insolence of so much recent art, we probably tend to underestimate the brutality of the Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. All his friends who saw it in his studio were at first shocked by it. And it was meant to shock…

A brothel may not in itself be shocking. But women painted without charm or sadness, without irony or social comment, women painted like the palings of a stockade through eyes that look out as if at death – that is shocking. And equally the method of painting. Picasso himself has said that he was influenced at the time by archaic Spanish (Iberian) sculpture. He was also influenced – particularly in the two heads at the right – by African masks…here it seems that Picasso's quotations are simple, direct, and emotional. He is not in the least concerned with formal problems. The dislocations in this picture are the result of aggression, not aesthetics; it is the nearest you can get in a painting to an outrage…

I emphasize the violent and iconoclastic aspect of this painting because it is usually enshrined as the great formal exercise which was the starting point of Cubism. It was the starting point of Cubism, in so far as it prompted Braque to begin painting at the end of the year his own far more formal answer to Les Demoiselles d'Avignon…yet if he had been left to himself, this picture would never have led Picasso to Cubism or to any way of painting remotely resembling it…It has nothing to with that twentieth-century vision of the future which was the essence of Cubism.

Yet it did provoke the beginning of the great period of exception in Picasso's life. Nobody can know exactly how the change began inside Picasso. We can only note the results. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, unlike any previous painting by Picasso, offers no evidence of skill. On the contrary, it is clumsy, overworked, unfinished. It is as though his fury in painting it was so great that it destroyed his gifts…

By painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon Picasso provoked Cubism. It was the spontaneous and, as always, primitive insurrection out of which, for good historical reasons, the revolution of Cubism developed.&lt;ref name="Berger" /&gt;}}

In 1972, art critic [[Leo Steinberg]] in his essay ''The Philosophical Brothel'' posited a wholly different explanation for the wide range of stylistic attributes. Using the earlier sketches—which had been ignored by most critics—he argued that far from evidence of an artist undergoing a rapid stylistic metamorphosis, the variety of styles can be read as a deliberate attempt, a careful plan, to capture the gaze of the viewer. He notes that the five women all seem eerily disconnected, indeed wholly unaware of each other. Rather, they focus solely on the viewer, their divergent styles only furthering the intensity of their glare.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt;

The earliest sketches feature two men inside the brothel; a sailor and a medical student (who was often depicted holding either a book or a skull, causing Barr and others to read the painting as a [[memento mori]], a reminder of death). A trace of their presence at a table in the center remains: the jutting edge of a table near the bottom of the canvas. The viewer, Steinberg argues, has come to replace the sitting men, forced to confront the gaze of prostitutes head on, invoking readings far more complex than a simple allegory or the autobiographical reading that attempts to understand the work in relation to Picasso's own history with women. A world of meanings then becomes possible, suggesting the work as a meditation on the danger of sex, the "trauma of the gaze" (to use a phrase of [[Rosalind Krauss]]'s invention), and the threat of violence inherent in the scene and sexual relations at large.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt;

According to Steinberg, the reversed gaze, that is, the fact that the figures look directly at the viewer, as well as the idea of the self-possessed woman, no longer there solely for the pleasure of the male gaze, may be traced back to [[Manet]]'s ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]]'' of 1863.&lt;ref name=Steinberg/&gt; [[William Rubin]] (1927–2006), the former Director of the Department of Painting and Sculpture at [[MoMA]] wrote that "Steinberg was the first writer to come to grips with the sexual subject of the Demoiselles."&lt;ref&gt;Rubin (1994), 30&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years after writing ''The Philosophical Brothel'', Steinberg wrote further about the revolutionary nature of ''Les Demoiselles'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Picasso was resolved to undo the continuities of form and field which [[Western art]] had so long taken for granted. The famous stylistic rupture at right turned out to be merely a consummation. Overnight, the contrived coherences of [[representational art]] - the feigned unities of time and place, the stylistic consistencies - all were declared to be fictional. The ''Demoiselles'' confessed itself a picture conceived in duration and delivered in spasms. In this one work Picasso discovered that the demands of discontinuity could be met on multiple levels: by cleaving depicted flesh; by elision of limbs and abbreviation; by slashing the web of connecting space; by abrupt changes of vantage; and by a sudden stylistic shift at the climax. Finally, the insistent staccato of the presentation was found to intensify the picture's address and symbolic charge: the beholder, instead of observing a roomfuI of lazing whores, is targeted from all sides. So far from suppressing the subject, the mode of organization heightens its flagrant eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artchive.com/theory/steinbrg/steinbrg.htm] Leo Steinberg selections, http://www.artchive.com. Retrieved 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the end of the first volume of his (so far) three volume Picasso biography: ''A Life Of Picasso. The Prodigy, 1881–1906,'' [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] comments on ''Les Demoiselles.'' Richardson says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is at this point, the beginning of 1907, that I propose to bring this first volume to an end. The 25-year-old Picasso is about to conjure up a quintet of [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] ''Demoiselles'' on his huge new canvas. The execution of this painting would make a dramatic climax to these pages. However, it would imply that Picasso's great revolutionary work constitutes a conclusion to all that has gone before. It does not. For all that the ''Demoiselles'' is rooted in Picasso's past, not to speak of such precursors as the [[Iron Age]] [[Iberian sculpture|Iberians]], [[El Greco]], [[Gauguin]] and [[Cézanne]], it is essentially a beginning: the most innovative painting since [[Giotto]]. As we will see in the next volume, it established a new pictorial syntax; it enabled people to perceive things with new eyes, new minds, new awareness. ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' is the first unequivocally 20th-century masterpiece, a principal detonator of the modern movement, the cornerstone of [[20th-century art]]. For Picasso it would also be a rite of passage: what he called an exorcism.' It cleared the way for cubism. It likewise banished the artist's demons. Later, these demons would return and require further exorcism. For the next decade, however, Picasso would feel as free and creative and 'as overworked' as God.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Richardson (art historian)|Richardson John]]. ''A Life of Picasso.

==Feminist interpretation==

===Form over content===

[[Leo Steinberg]] in his 1988 text "The Philosophical Brothel" quotes from an uncited source which may provide insight regarding Picasso's intent in the creation and context of ''Les Demoiselles D'Avignon''. Quoting from an anonymous but well-informed New Yorker, Steinberg suggests that "in 1907 Picasso had contracted VD, and painted the Demoiselles to vent his rage against women".&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Leo 1988"&gt;Steinberg, Leo. "The Philosophical Brothel". October 44 (1988): 7–74. Web. 4 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This assumption may be reinforced in the artist's referral to the work as "My first exorcism-painting". In 1965 the British critic [[John Berger]] suggested that Picasso, during his first years in Paris, "probably was suffering from venereal disease and was obsessed by it". Then, in her ''Picasso: Art as Autobiography'', Mary Gedo substantiated Berger's suspicion (having had it confirmed by [[Françoise Gilot]]). Accordingly, she interpreted much of the evolution and final character of the ''Demoiselles'' in the light of the artist's medical history and consequent ambivalence toward women.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, Leo. "Retrospect: Sixteen Years After," postscript to reprint of "The Philosophical Brothel," October, no. 44, Spring 1988. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While critics such as [[Alfred H. Barr Jr.]] would prefer that the work be discussed in purely formalistic qualities, [[Edwin Mullins]] states that the effect of STIs cannot be so easily be disregarded and that though these are "not today's experiences of art, they are among the experiences out which, and for which, art has been made - and without which a great deal of art would not have been made at all".&lt;ref name="Mullins, Edwin B. 1985"&gt;Mullins, Edwin B. ''"Man-Eaters." The Painted Witch: How Western Artists Have Viewed the Sexuality of Women''. New York: Carroll &amp; Graf, 1985. 39-56. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carol Duncan]] in her 1973 article "Virility and Domination in Early Twentieth-Century Vanguard Painting" states that:

{{quote|No painting of this decade better articulates the male-female dichotomy and the ambivalence men experience before it... What is so remarkable about this work is the way it manifests the structural foundation underlying both the femme fatale and the new primitive woman. Picasso did not merely combine these into one horrible image; he dredged up from his psyche the terrifying and fascinating beast that gave birth to both of them. The Demoiselles prismatically mirrors her many opposing faces: whore and deity, decadent and savage, tempting and repelling, awesome and obscene, looming and crouching, masked and naked, threatening and powerless.&lt;ref name="Duncan, Carol 1982"&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/barnard/arthist/wolff/pdfs/week6_duncan.pdf Duncan, Carol. "Virility and Domination in Early Twentieth-Century Vanguard Painting."] ''Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany''. By Norma Broude and [[Mary D. Garrard]]. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1982. 293-313. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These sources in close connection to each other suggest that the portrayal of women in the post-modern era may be more closely linked to the spread of STIs, than some individuals and institutions within the art world would like to recognize. To quote Edwin Mullins in ''The Painted Witch'' (1985) "One day somebody will have the art world reaching for its smelling-salts with a study of the effects of disease on the making of art."&lt;ref name="Mullins, Edwin B. 1985"/&gt;

Steinberg dismissed many of Barr's views which favoured that ''Les Demoiselles D'Avignon'' could be reduced to a strictly formal figure composition. In particular that Barr argued that the intellectual observer would address the work was to view it in strictly formalistic qualities: the work was a triumph of form over content; to see it with intelligence was to see it resolved into abstract energies.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, Leo 1988"/&gt; Barr's methodology of addressing Picasso's work was not fundamentally challenged until Leo Steinberg's article. Steinberg felt that by 1988 this method of critique had transformed from criticism to cliché and that reducing the work to a purely formal figure composition would make it a mere forerunner of things to come. Picasso had indeed abandoned the ''[[memento mori]]'' allegory but not the sexual thematics of the painting.&lt;ref name="Foster, Hal 1907"&gt;Foster, Hal. "1907." ''Art since 1900: Modernism, Antimodernism, Postmodernism''. New York: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2004. 78-84. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna C. Chave]] for example in "New Encounters with Les Demoiselles d'Avignon: Gender, Race, and the Origins of Cubism" addresses that the work had come to be understood to mark or even to have precipitated the demise of the old visual order and the advent of the new. A momentous act of destruction, the painting is also understood as one of creation.&lt;ref name=anna&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chave|first= Anna C.|title=New Encounters with Les Demoiselles d'Avignon: Gender, Race, and the Origins of Cubism|journal= The Art Bulletin|volume= 76|issue=4|year=1994|pages=597–611|jstor=3046058}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designated the first Cubist painting "the signal for the Cubist revolution" in its full-fledged dismantling of representational conventions the painting is now more loosely considered a curtain raiser or trigger to Cubism. Others had pulled crucial triggers before Picasso. When Baudelaire told Manet, "You are only the first in the decrepitude of your art," he referred to the scandalously frank picture of a courtesan, ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'', rendered with startling flatness in 1865. For that matter, a compressed or compromised female form, often that of prostitute or femme fatale, would come to serve almost as an avatar of modernism.' Picasso, often lifted his imagery from the lexicon of European art and by revisiting works, jolted the viewer into reacting to it afresh."&lt;ref name=anna/&gt; If the disintegration of the great traditions of painting could already be detected in Olympia, the evidence of that decrepitude was plainly that much further advanced in Les Demoiselles. And insofar as it calls the very notion unified style, and so the possibility of finish, into question, the painting's ruptured aspect made it serve the purpose of signifying a moment of rupture particularly well. The evolution of Cubism was impelled by a realization of "the conventional rather than the imitative nature of representation", as art history professor Christine Poggi succinctly phrases it; and a corollary of that realization was "that style can be a kind of mask, to be worn at will", so that "there was no reason to observe the law of unity".&lt;ref name=anna/&gt;

===Did they have to be whores?===

The employment of the disenfranchised female as visual icon within the art world is a fact that feminist critics have diagnosed, as the avant-garde's testing of cultural limits, where the female body, as symptomatic of a visual regime where "Woman" serves as "the very ground of representation, both object and support of a desire which, intimately bound up with power and creativity, is the moving force of culture and history."&lt;ref name=anna/&gt; The ability of male artists to form new expressive modes of representation filled with dynamic power is not a new concept within art history; Duncan in particular emphasizes and exposes the relationship between art historians and the avant-garde painters of the post modern era in that art historians emphasize the notion: "that avant-garde art consists of so many movements of individual artistic freedom, a freedom evidenced in the artist's capacity for innovation"&lt;ref name="Duncan, Carol 1982" /&gt; and in this freedom both artist and historian are freed to analyze and construct work in a larger structure without recognizing the social constraints and responsibilities of the past and their impact on contemporary society. Duncan questions where does this innovation arise? Is it completely unmotivated? A gift from God? We may never know. Picasso in discussing the work was often resistant to acknowledge any guidance in context; favouring instead to address it in a way which ranged from vague, humorous and sarcastic. For example, when "speaking to Kahnweiler in December 1933, Picasso recalled the jokes he and his friends bandied about the women in the ''Demoiselles'' painting, identifying one of them as Picasso's girlfriend, Fernande, another as Marie Laurencin, a third as the grandmother of his poet friend Max Jacob-"all in a brothel in Avignon!" &lt;ref name="Steinberg, Leo 1988"/&gt;

Picasso in choosing his subject matter with the intention of creating a new visual language as addressed by Barr that "The ''Demoiselles'' is a transitional picture, a laboratory or, better, a battlefield of trial and experience; but it is also a work of formidable, dynamic power unsurpassed in European art of its time" &lt;ref name="Foster, Hal 1907"/&gt; Did the work have to be a representation of whores? Couldn't the Proto-Cubist effects previously described have been accomplished just as easily with a cast of card players?" &lt;ref name="Steinberg, Leo 1988"/&gt; According to various critical sources such as Steinberg, Chave, Mullins, Rubins and other critics of ''Les Demoiselles'' the answer is no. They had to be whores. If the viewer is able to fully understand the disquieting effect created by Picasso in their viewing of the work, this reshaping of power could only have been accomplished by the role of Woman or as labelled by Edwin Mullins; Man-Eaters. This is due to the entity of Woman existing as the symbolic embodiment of the natural world in its beauty and ferocity to exist in contrast and outside of the hegemonic structures created by man. As such, a picture of a dangerous woman is powerful because it is the icon of a man's innermost terrors."&lt;ref name="Mullins, Edwin B 1985"&gt;Mullins, Edwin B. "Man-Eaters." The Painted Witch: How Western Artists Have Viewed the Sexuality of Women. New York: Carroll &amp; Graf, 1985. 39-56. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As, Woman is a creature which threatens to usurp the power and control of her male counterpart through the employment of her sex; described by Freud as Castration Anxiety. The anxiety present in Les Demoiselles presumes as virtually every critic who has addressed Les Demoiselles the picture's intended viewer is male and heterosexual. As conventionally, both the act of painting and that of viewing have been described as phallic acts, acts of penetration performed on that passive receptacle, the blank field of the canvas and the critic Jean Clair once pithily proclaimed, "The gaze is the erection of the eye."' Such metaphors and the general conceit of penetration as a trope for knowing implicitly exclude the female artist and viewer, as such and from a masculinist vantage point, the work would be read as a horror story, but from a feminist one it could be, to the contrary, a fable or even a good omen of vengeance won against male tyranny.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Chave, Anna C. "New Encounters with Les Demoiselles d'Avignon: Gender, Race, and the Origins of Cubism." The Art Bulletin, vol. 76, no. 4, 1994, pp. 597–611. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3046058.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The trauma of the gaze===

Freudian analysis is a fairly recent step in literature devoted to the painting. Several psychoanalytic scenarios dealing with the "primal scene" and the "castration complex" apply well to ''Les Demoiselles D'Avignon''. They help us understand both the suppression of the "memento mori" allegory and the brutality of the finished picture.&lt;ref name="Foster, Hal 1907"/&gt; According to Sigmund Freud the female body figures in male fantasy are mapped as a castrated body, ''Les Demoiselles'' do not simply represent a figure of impotence; rather, woman becomes phallic through her association with this powerful fantasmatic energy. As Steinberg and others see them, Picasso's demoiselles are eminently phallic: the prostitute second from left "arrives like a projectile"; the one in the centre is "a pillar nude"; the crouching figure at the right evokes "a jumping jack"; and all the women "start up like jerked puppets."&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; To construct the female figure as a phallus is, in Freudian terms, a fetishistic strategy, a gesture at once of recognition and disavowal of the alarming fact that women have no penises. Numerous critics have framed Picasso's act in creating ''Les Demoiselles'' in related terms, as a self-ministering ploy to exorcise his private "demons," his fear of women and others. "My first exorcism-painting," the artist once called the picture, in an oft-quoted statement.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; The demons within the work however, represented are mere fissions of danger. As, the images presented are merely paintings on canvas and rather than putting the viewer at risk of physical harm allow them to address their anxiety within the sanitized gallery space.&lt;ref name="Mullins, Edwin B 1985"/&gt; Freud's short text Medusa's head with all its multitude of meanings - Including the notion that Medusa's head is the female sex organ - the sight of which arouses castration anxiety in the young male; the image of castration itself (decapitation); and the denial of castration, on the one hand by the multiplication of penises (her hair consists of snakes) and, on the other, by its power to turn the spectre to stone, in other words, into an erect, albeit dead, phallus.&lt;ref name="Foster, Hal 1907"/&gt;

===Rubin, Seckel, Cousins===
The 1994 book ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' by [[William Rubin]], Helene Seckel and Judith Cousins represents an in-depth analysis of the work and its genesis. Rubin suggests that some of the figure's faces symbolize the disfigurements of [[syphilis]], and that the painting was created following a series of brothel visits by Picasso, who was then temporarily separated from his mistress [[Fernande Olivier]]. Rubin interprets the painting as expressing the artist's [[atheism]], his willingness to risk anarchy for freedom, his fear of disease and illness, and, most forcefully, 'his deep-seated fear and loathing of the female body, which existed side by side with his craving for and ecstatic idealization of it.'&lt;ref&gt;Frey, Julia.

[[Jacques Doucet (fashion designer)|Jacques Doucet]] had seen the painting at the Salon d'Antin, yet remarkably seems to have purchased ''Les Demoiselles'' without asking Picasso to unroll it in his studio so that he could see it again.&lt;ref name="Bohm-Duchen" /&gt; André Breton later described the transaction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I remember the day he bought the painting from Picasso, who strange as it may seem, appeared to be intimidated by Doucet and even offered no resistance when the price was set at 25,000 francs: "Well then, it's agreed, M. Picasso." Doucet then said: "You shall receive 2,000 francs per month, beginning next month, until the sum of 25,000 francs is reached.&lt;ref name="Bohm-Duchen" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Richardson quotes Breton in a letter to Doucet about ''Les Demoiselles'' writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt; through it one penetrates right into the core of Picasso's laboratory and because it is the crux of the drama, the center of all the conflicts that Picasso has given rise to and that will last forever....It is a work which to my mind transcends painting; it is the theater of everything that has happened in the last 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;John Richardson, with Marilyn McCully, ''A Life Of Picasso The Triumphant Years, 1917–1932'', Albert A. Knopf 2007, p. 244, {{ISBN|978-0-307-26666-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ultimately, it seems Doucet paid 30,000 francs rather than the agreed price.&lt;ref name="Bohm-Duchen" /&gt; A few months after the purchase Doucet had the painting appraised at between 250,000 and 300,000 francs. Richardson speculates that Picasso, who by 1924 was on the top of the art world and didn't need to sell the painting to Doucet, did so and at that low price because Doucet promised ''Les Demoiselles'' would go to the [[Louvre]] in his will. However, after Doucet died in 1929 he did not leave the painting to the Louvre in his will, and it was sold like most of Doucet's collection through private dealers.&lt;ref name="Bohm-Duchen" /&gt;

In November 1937 the [[Jacques Seligmann &amp; Company|Jacques Seligman &amp; Co.]] art gallery in New York City held an exhibition titled "20 Years in the Evolution of Picasso, 1903–1923" that included ''Les Demoiselles.'' The [[Museum of Modern Art]] acquired the painting for $24,000. The museum raised $18,000 toward the purchase price by selling a [[Edgar Degas|Degas]] painting and the rest came from donations from the co-owners of the gallery [[Germain Seligman]] and Cesar de Hauke.&lt;ref&gt;Fluegel, 309&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City mounted an important Picasso exhibition on 15 November 1939 that remained on view until 7 January 1940. The exhibition entitled: ''Picasso:40 Years of His Art,'' was organized by [[Alfred H. Barr]] (1902–1981), in collaboration with the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The exhibition contained 344 works, including the major and then newly painted ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' and its studies, as well as ''Les Demoiselles.''&lt;ref&gt;Fluegel, 350&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In July 2007, ''[[Newsweek]]'' published a two-page article about ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' describing it as the "most influential work of art of the last 100 years".&lt;ref name=Newsweek&gt;Plagens, Peter. ''[http://www.newsweek.com/2007/06/23/which-is-the-most-influential-work-of-art-of-the-last-100-years.html Which Is the Most Influential Work of Art of the Last 100 Years?]'', Art, Newsweek, 2 July/9 July 2007, pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic [[Holland Cotter]] argued that Picasso "changed history with this work. He'd replaced the benign ideal of the Classical nude with a new race of sexually armed and dangerous beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/arts/design/11picasso.html|title=When Picasso Changed His Tune|last=Cotter|first=Holland|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 February 2011|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is prominently featured in the 2018 season of the television series ''[[Genius (U.S. TV series)|Genius]]'' which focuses on Picasso's life and work.

==Painting materials==
In 2003, an examination of the painting by [[x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]] performed by conservators at the Museum of Modern Art confirmed the presence of the following pigments: [[lead white]], [[bone black]], [[vermilion]], [[cadmium yellow]], [[cobalt blue]], [[emerald green]], and native earth pigments (such as brown [[ochre]]) that contain iron.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/explore/conservation/demoiselles/ Les Demoiselles d’Avignon: Conserving a modern masterpiece], Website of Museum of Modern Art, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://colourlex.com/project/picasso-les-demoiselles-d-avignon/ Pablo Picasso, 'Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'] ColourLex&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7375">'''Mythos''' is the term used by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (c. 335 BCE) for the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of an [[Tragedy#Performance_of_Greek_tragedies|Athenian tragedy]]. It is the first of the six elements of tragedy that he gives.

== Variations on plot ==
“In ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' 13 and 14, Aristotle turns from the discussion of the three separate parts of the plot to a consideration of the plot as a whole composed of these three parts”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 160&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Poetics'' 13, Aristotle states his idea that the purpose of tragedy is the arousal of pity and fear.  According to Belfiore, even though Aristotle uses one set of criteria for good plots in ''Poetics'' 13 and a different set in ''Poetics'' 14, “these two accounts are more consistent with one another than is often thought”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 161&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle defines plot in chapter 13 of ''Poetics'' as a variation of two different “change types” and three different “character types”.  A tragic plot is a movement or change between the end points of good and bad fortune, because of that there are two possible kinds of change: change that begins in good fortune and ends in bad fortune, and change that begins in bad fortune and ends in good fortune.  The three possible “character types” are the characters of “decent” people, people “outstanding in excellence and justice”; “evil people”; and the “in-between man”.  Of the six logically possible outcomes, Aristotle lists only four.  Aristotle contends in ''Poetics'' 13 that the most desirable plot involves ‘An in-between person who changes from good to bad fortune, due to [[hamartia]], “error.”  Additionally, Aristotle states that the plot in which ‘An evil person changes from bad to good fortune,’ is the most untragic of all because it is not philanthropic, pitiable, or fearful.’  ''Poetics'' 13 deals with good and bad combinations of character types and change. Conversely, ''Poetics'' 14 discusses good and bad combinations of a pathos with the knowledge or ignorance of the agent.  “Ranked from worst to best, by Aristotle, these are the four logical possibilities of [[pathos]]:

1. A pathos is about to occur, with knowledge, but does not occur.

2. A pathos occurs, with knowledge.

3. A pathos occurs, in ignorance.

4. A pathos is about to occur, in ignorance, but does not occur”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 171&lt;/ref&gt;

The emotional effect peculiar to the tragic action is therefore that of promoting the experience of feelings such as pity and terror, which constitute the ultimate end at which the representation of the mythos aims.&lt;ref name="Rizzoli 11"&gt;Rizzoli 11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aristotle's mythos vs. the modern interpretation of plot ==
Aristotle’s notion of mythos in ''Poetics'' differs from the modern interpretation of plot most prominently in its role in drama. According to Elizabeth Belfiore’s ''Tragic Pleasures; Aristotle on Plot and Emotion'', Aristotle believed that “plot is essential to tragedy, ethos [character] is second to plot”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore, Elizabeth. "Narratological Plots and Aristotle's Mythos." Arethusa 33 (2000): 37-70.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believes that “psychological and ethical considerations are secondary to the events themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 40&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle’s view focuses nearly all of his attention on the events of the plot, which, in turn, leaves the characters to become merely conveyors of situations rather than humans with convictions and motives. According to [[Meir Sternberg]], Aristotle “restricts the well-made epic or play to a ‘whole’ (holos) action, with ‘beginning, middle, and end’ linked throughout by necessary or probable sequence, so that nothing will follow its cutoff point”&lt;ref&gt;[[Meir Sternberg|Sternberg, Meir]]. "Universals of Narrative and Their Cognitivist Fortunes (II)." ''[[Poetics Today]]'' 24 (2003): 517-638.&lt;/ref&gt;). Aristotle’s definition of plot states that every event portrayed and every action taken is a logical progression from previous events.  Aristotle’s focuses on mythos (plot) as opposed to a focus on ethos (character) or “conflict either in the sense of struggle within a person or in the sense of the clashing of opposed principles”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 64&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle explains that tragedy imitates the actions and lives of human beings rather than human beings themselves.&lt;ref&gt;1450.a:16-17&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle concerns himself with the universally logical events of a plot, rather than the specific and often illogical conflicts between characters associated with those events.

[[German idealism|German idealist]] philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]] believed that tragedy consists of the conflicts between each character’s ethical justification and the resolution toward a greater rational good.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, Mark W. "Introduction to Hegel's Theory of Tragedy." PhaenEx 1 (2006): 11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel’s viewpoint places character conflict as the central focus of tragedy, in clear contradiction to Aristotle’s plot-centric theory of tragedy. According to Meir Sternberg, modernist dramatic theory endorses the “open ending, and poststructuralism for preaching endless indeterminacy,” which is most noticeable in the modern absurdist theater.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg 519&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, Sternberg asserts that Aristotle’s viewpoint directs all complex endings and forms of closure into simple cause-and-effect sequences.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg 524&lt;/ref&gt;

As well, many of Aristotle’s conclusions directly oppose those of twentieth century narratologists such as [[Vladimir Propp]], who “reverses Aristotle's theory that ‘tragedy is imitation not of human beings but of actions,’ by writing that stories are about characters who act”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 45&lt;/ref&gt; Propp also argues that basic story elements, which he defines as functions, “are in fact ethically colored, either in themselves or because they are defined in terms of a character who has specific ethical qualities”.&lt;ref&gt;Belfiore 46&lt;/ref&gt; Propp’s viewpoint directly conflicts with that of Aristotle in ''Poetics'' because Aristotle states that drama consists of a logical sequence of events that is not affected by ethical dilemmas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9654">The '''National Society of Arts and Letters''', known as the NSAL, is an American non-profit group founded in 1944 as a [[women's organization]] to assist promising young artists through arts [[competitions]], [[scholarships]] and other [[career]] opportunities.&lt;ref name="NSAL-history"&gt;NSAL, [http://www.arts-nsal.org/history.shtml "The History of NSAL"] (NSAL website, last visited July 16, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara McCormick, [http://www.bocaratontribune.com/national-society-of-arts-and-letters-hosts-afternoon-tea/ "National Society of Arts and Letters Hosts Afternoon Tea"], ''Boca Raton Tribune'', March 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomington-proclamation"&gt;[http://bloomington.in.gov/documents/viewDocument.php?document_id=2719 "National Society of Arts and Letters Day"] (May 13, 2008) - Proclamation by City of Bloomington, Indiana, dated May 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Men were later admitted to the organization, and have been an important and enriching addition.

==National Career Awards Competition==
The National Career Awards Competition, organized by the NSAL is held each year in one of the following categories: visual arts, [[dance]], [[drama]], [[literature]], [[music]] or [[musical theater]]. Participants in the National Career Awards Competition compete at the local chapter level for a series of monetary awards. First-place winners of the Local Chapter Competitions are sent to the NSAL National Competition, which is held each spring during the Society’s annual meeting. Participants in the National Competition compete for a first place award of $15,000, and a series of other awards that can total another $10,000 or more.

The competitions are designed to offer exposure for young artists who want to be heard and seen by professional critics, managers, producers, teachers, the media, and patrons of the arts.

During its history, the competitions organized by the NSAL have benefitted Oscar-winning actress and dancer [[Shirley MacLaine]] and international opera star [[Jessye Norman]] among others. In 1998, non-citizens were permitted full membership privileges, thereby extending a more inviting, inclusive image to the organization.

All competitions are adjudicated by nationally recognized men and women in the arts. A [[master class]] is conducted by judges for the National Career Awards Competitions. Opportunities for one-on-one sessions and individual critiques are also encouraged.

==History==
Begun by a group of civic-minded women who wanted to encourage young talent in the arts, the National Society of Arts and Letters determined from its inception that the best way to accomplish that goal was to sponsor competitions and offer scholarships in the categories of art, music and literature.&lt;ref name="NSAL-history" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dance.uiuc.edu/events/national-society-of-arts-and-letters "National Society of Arts and Letters"], "Events" (Announcements), University of Illinois Dept. of Dance (last visited July 15, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 1944, they met at the home of the future first National President, Mollie Davis Nicholson, to found a group that specified it was non-partisan, non-political and non-profit-making. The [[Chevy Chase]], [[Maryland]] Chapter was organized that year and became the Washington, D.C. Chapter on March 31, 1945, with Dorothy Nicholson Bates Stabell as its first president and founder.

A second chapter, the [[Chicago]] Chapter, was started by Francesca Falk Miller Nielsen, also in October 1944. In 1945, both chapters awarded scholarships: one in piano, three in voice (Washington) and one in pipe organ (Chicago).

On June 30, 1945, the first national conference of the National Society of Arts and Letters was held in Chicago. By this time, eight chapters had been formed: [[Washington, D.C.]], Chicago, [[Florida]], [[Colorado]], [[North Dakota]], [[California]], [[Texas]] and [[Kentucky]]. The bylaws provided membership to women qualified in the arts who were U.S. citizens. Artist member Emma W. Slack designed the insignia. Young artists were to be encouraged by receipt of donor gifts, chapter prizes, scholarships and exhibitions of their work or talent arranged by a chapter.

By 1946 four more chapters had started: [[Arkansas]], [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]] and [[New Jersey]]. A convention was held in Washington, D.C., between April 15–16 of that year, at the [[Mayflower Hotel]] in Washington, D.C. [[First Lady of the United States|American First Lady]] [[Bess Truman]], initiated the festivities with a reception at the [[White House]].&lt;ref name="NSAL-history" /&gt;

As growth continued, Francesca Falk Miller Nielsen, the second National President, introduced and edited the newsletter. It was planned to issue it three times a year. A [[Certificate of Incorporation]], was issued July 29, 1949 and [[tax-exempt status]], was recorded November 7, 1949. By 1949 both dance and drama categories had been added to the competitions. By 1951, 25 chapters had been started.

In October 1994 members gathered together for a gala celebration of the Societies' 50th anniversary. The Central [[Illinois]] Chapter hosted the 60th Anniversary celebration in 2005 with performances by former contestants from 1959-2002. There was also a video featuring Dorothy Nicholson Stabell, daughter of one of the founders.

Today there are 20 NSAL Chapters in 17 states.

==Master classes==
Part of the National competitions are the master classes conducted by judges in each art category. One-on-one sessions are also offered and encouraging critiques of each contestant are provided by the judges.

The National Society of Arts and Letters classifies the arts into six different categories: Art, Dance, Drama, Literature, Music and Musical Theatre; various sub-categories exist within each category. The annual National Competitions rotate among these six categories with the particular sub-category selected by the membership.

Master classes have been conducted in all the arts categories beginning in 2000. They have been conducted for NSAL by their judges and guest teachers including:
* Larry Leichman (co-owner of [[Arbor Books]]), literature
* Joel Revzen, [[Nathan Gunn]] and Gayletha Nichols, singing
* Robert and Louise McCall, art
* Brian Palmer, assistant professor of dance and Chair of the Division of Theatre and Dance at [[Jacksonville University]], dance
* [[Terence Knapp]], acting and theater
* Mark Hoebee, Associate Director of [[Paper Mill Playhouse]], theater
* [[George Pinney]] co-creator of Blast!
* Jane Alderman
* Karen Azenberg, [[choreographer]], dance
* Marek Cholewa, dance
* [[Lucine Amara]] of the [[Metropolitan Opera]], music
* Sarah Caldwell [[Dramatic Soprano]], Maestra, opera
* Alfonso Montecino, concert pianist, music
* Lori Belilove, [[modern dance]]
* Cynthia Bringle, pottery
* Professor [[Josip Novakovich]], writing.

==Awards==
Since the first national competition in 1951, NSAL has presented more than 4,000 awards to young artists. Chapter competitions are usually held in various artistic categories including the one special category specified for the National Competition for that year; only the first-place winners from the chapter competitions in this category advance to the National Competition.

Early on in the history of NSAL, the Nicholson/Nielsen Trust Fund was established to provide permanent support for awards to be given annually to ranking finalists in the National Career Award Competition. The principal of the Fund remains intact while the income is used to provide awards each year in one of the six rotating art categories which NSAL highlights in its National Competition.

Individuals and corporations may also endow a named award by contributing to the Fund. Current awards available from tax-exempt gifts to this Fund totaling $10,000 or more include:

NSAL First Place Award of $10,000 or more is in memory of Mollie Davis Nicholson and Francesca Falk Miller Nielson, founders of the Society. The Estelle Campbell Award is presented to the second-place winner. The Mary Peery Fife Memorial Award is given in the category of Dance. The Catherine A. M. Cavanaugh Award is given in the Literature Category. Other awards include the Dorothy and Bruce Strong Award and the Mollie Davis Nicholson Award

A second important activity of NSAL is the annual Winston Scholarship Program for visual artists and vocalists. Each year, scholarships totaling $18,000 - $20,000 are awarded to artists in these fields who are sixteen to twenty-two years of age. Supported by an endowment from Shirley Rabb Winston, these scholarships are used for special study in the recipient’s field.

Notable recipients of NSAL awards have included [[Malcolm Frager]] (pianist),&lt;ref name="bloomington-proclamation" /&gt; [[Shirley MacLaine]] (actor),&lt;ref name="NSAL-history" /&gt; [[Jessye Norman]] (opera singer; winner of a NSAL contest),&lt;ref name="NSAL-history" /&gt; [[Menahem Pressler]] (Gold Medal of Merit from the National Society of Arts and Letters),&lt;ref&gt;[http://menahempressler.org/?page_id=381 MenahemPressler.org], last visited 2012/07/16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Balanchine]] (1980 Gold Medal of Merit recipient&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sab.org/school/history/balanchine_biography.php Balanchine Biography], School of American Ballet at Lincoln Center] (last visited July 16, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Penrith Hoard''' is a dispersed [[hoard]] of 10th century silver [[penannular brooch]]es found at Flusco Pike, Newbiggin Moor, Near [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] in [[Cumbria]], and now in the [[British Museum]] in London. The largest "thistle brooch" was discovered in 1785 and another in 1830, with the bulk of items being recovered in two groups close to each other by archaeologists in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Silver 'thistle' brooch | publisher=[[British Museum]] | url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/silver_thistle_brooch.aspx | accessdate=2010-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether all the finds made close to each other were originally deposited at the same time remains uncertain, but it is thought likely that at least the brooches were.  The brooches are thought to have been deposited in about 930.

==Discoveries==
[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 014-crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The "brambled" terminal of the largest brooch in the main picture.]]  
The earliest surviving finds were discovered in what was already called the "Silver Field" on Newbiggin Moor by a small boy in 1785, the name suggesting that earlier finds, now lost, had been made. In 1830 another smaller thistle brooch was found. Although the exact find spot is not known, this brooch is strongly suspected to have also come from the "Silver Field".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/cnwrs/papers%20on%20the%20web/arch%20conf%20synopses%201999.rtf Synopses of papers given at the 26th Annual Archaeology Conference, 6 March 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231456/http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/cnwrs/papers%20on%20the%20web/arch%20conf%20synopses%201999.rtf |date=5 June 2011 }}, University of Lancaster Centre for North-West Regional Studies. Retrieved 6 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The usual reason for a hoard being "disbursed" is that routine farming operations like ploughing can move some items of a single hoard before they are discovered.

Later archaeological investigations in 1989 at the same spot revealed other silver items that confirmed that this was a dispersed hoard and not a solitary loss of one brooch. Two groups of items were found in nearby fields: one consisted of five Viking brooches, with fragments of two more, and the other of more than fifty items comprising coins, [[ingot]]s, jewellery and [[hacksilver]] (jewellery and other silver pieces chopped up) of a very similar date.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=3242725&amp;partid=1&amp;output=Places%2f!!%2fOR%2f!!%2f30930%2f!%2f30930-3-1%2f!%2fExcavated%2fFindspot+Penrith%2f!%2f%2f!!%2f%2f!!!%2f&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database%2fadvanced_search.aspx&amp;currentPage=2&amp;numpages=10 British Museum collection database] "ingot/hacksilver", item from the second hoard.&lt;/ref&gt;  The brooches were declared to be "[[treasure trove]]" at an inquest held in Penrith on 23 July 1990, and entered the British Museum in 1991, joined by the other hoard in 2009.

==Context==
The penannular brooch, originally a common utilitarian clothes fastening, normally of [[base metal]], in [[Roman Britain]] developed in the post-Roman period into highly elaborate and decorative marks of status in Ireland and Scotland, made in precious metals and often decorated with gems, and worn by men and women.  When the Vikings began to raid and settle the British Isles, they took to wearing these brooches, but now in plain silver.  The thistle and bossed types represented in the hoard were the most popular styles, both developing out of earlier Celtic styles.

It has been speculated that the hoard, with items strongly suggesting an Irish connection, is connected with the events of 927, a date which matches the style of the finds.  In that year "the kings of Strathclyde and Scotland came south to Penrith to pay homage to [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]]".  Also in the area with his army was the troublesome [[Norse-Gael]] [[king of Dublin]], [[Gofraid ua Ímair]], or Gothfrith.  Athelstan made the kings, who had apparently been associating with pagan Vikings like Gothrith, renounce idolatry, but "Gothfrith and company had slipped away in order to attack [[Viking York|York]]".&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Campbell, 224&lt;/ref&gt;  After briefly making himself [[king of Northumbria]] there, he was chased out and replaced by Athelstan later in the year, and went back to Ireland.  At some point during these manoevres the hoards may have been deposited.

==Items discovered==

The large thistle brooch soon passed to the [[Leverian Museum]], a private museum in [[Leicester Square]] in London. In 1787 a print of it was published, claiming that it was the insignia of the [[Knights Templar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/britain/enlightenment_archaeology/silver_thistle_brooch.aspx British Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213230940/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/britain/enlightenment_archaeology/silver_thistle_brooch.aspx |date=2011-02-13 }} ''Enlightenment: The Birth of Archaeology, Silver 'thistle' brooch''&lt;/ref&gt;  It was bought by the British Museum in 1909 (M&amp;ME 1909,6-24,2).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=65058&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=Penrith+Hoard&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=6 British Museum collection database] Large silver brooch (M&amp;ME 1909,6-24,2).&lt;/ref&gt;

The brooch discovered in 1830, the largest in the group illustrated, entered the museum in 1904 (M&amp;ME 1904,1102.3). One terminal is missing, and the pin is 52&amp;nbsp;cm long. In 1989 two further incomplete thistle brooches and pieces from three bossed-type brooches were found, which are seen with the 1830 brooch in the group illustration above.  The most complete of the 1989 group (illustrated left) has a [[rune|runic]] [[futhark]] scratched on the reverse of the hoop.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1615235&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=Penannular+Penrith&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=1 British Museum collection database] brooch (M&amp;ME 1991,0109.2).&lt;/ref&gt;  The other two have [[interlace (art)|interlace]] around the bosses on the terminals.

It is thought likely that all these brooches were originally deposited together and have been dispersed and damaged by ploughing.

[[File:Plot v. story en.png|right|thumb|300px|Plot and Story.  Plot is the cause‐and‐effect sequence of events in a story.&lt;ref name="dibell" /&gt;]]

'''Plot''' refers to the sequence of events inside a [[narrative|story]] which affect other events through the principle of [[Causality|cause and effect]]. The causal events of a plot can be thought of as a series of sentences linked by "and so". Plots can vary from simple structures such as in a traditional [[ballad]] to complex interwoven structures sometimes referred to as an ''imbroglio''. The term ''plot'' can serve as a verb and refer to a character planning future actions in the story.

In the narrative sense, the term highlights the important points which have important consequences within the story, according to Ansen Dibell.&lt;ref name="dibell"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ansen Dibell, Ph.D.|title=Plot|date=1999-07-15|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|series=Elements of Fiction Writing|pages=5 f.|isbn=978-0-89879-946-0|quote=Plot is built of significant events in a given story – significant because they have important consequences. Taking a shower isn't necessarily plot... Let's call them incidents ... Plot is the things characters do, feel, think or say, that make a difference to what comes afterward.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is similar in meaning to the term ''storyline''.&lt;ref&gt;''Random House Dictionary.'' "[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/plot?s=t plot]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionaries.'' "[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/storyline?q=storyline storyline]."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
English novelist [[E. M. Forster]] described plot as the cause-and-effect relationship between events in a story. According to Forster, "''The king died, and then the queen died,'' is a story, while ''The king died, and then the queen died of grief,'' is a plot."&lt;ref name="prince"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prince|first=Gerald|title=A Dictionary of Narratology|publisher=University of Nebraska Press.|edition=Revised|date=2003-12-01|page=73|isbn=978-0-8032-8776-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wales|first=Katie|title=A Dictionary of Stylistics|series=Longman Linguistics|publisher=Routledge|edition=3|date=2011-05-19|page=320|isbn=978-1-4082-3115-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E.M. Aspects of the Novel. Mariner Books. (1956) {{ISBN|978-0156091800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider the following:

::#The prince searches for Cinderella with the glass shoe
::#Cinderella's sisters tried the shoe on but it does not fit
::#The shoe fits Cinderella's foot so the prince finds her

The first event is causally related to the third event, while the second event, though descriptive, does not directly impact the outcome. As a result, according to Dibell, the plot can be described numerically as 1→3 while the story can be described as 1→2→3. A story orders events from beginning to end in a time sequence.&lt;ref name="dibell" /&gt; Teri Shaffer Yamada agrees that a plot does not include memorable [[Scene (drama)|scenes]] within a story which do not relate directly to other events but only "major events that move the action in a narrative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Teri Shaffer Yamada, Ph.D.|title=ELEMENTS OF FICTION|publisher=[[California State University, Long Beach]]|url=http://www.csulb.edu/~yamadaty/EleFic.html|accessdate=2014-12-20|archivedate=2014-12-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220115428/http://www.csulb.edu/~yamadaty/EleFic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the 1997 film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', when Rose climbs on the railing at the front of the ship and spreads her hands as if she's flying, this scene is memorable but does not directly influence other events, so it may not be considered as part of the plot. Another example of a memorable scene which is not part of the plot occurs in the 1980 film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', when Han Solo is frozen in carbonite.&lt;ref name="dibell" /&gt; Steve Alcorn, a fiction-writing coach, said the main plot elements of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' could be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name="alcorn"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Alcorn|title=Know the Difference Between Plot and Story|publisher=Tejix|url=http://www.tejix.com/en/PaperPlot.html|accessdate=2014-08-24|archivedate= 2014-08-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823193203/http://www.tejix.com/en/PaperPlot.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fabula and syuzhet ===
{{Main|Fabula and syuzhet}}
The literary theory of Russian Formalism in the early 20th century divided a narrative into two elements: the ''fabula'' (фа́була) and the ''syuzhet'' (сюже́т). A fabula is the events in the fictional world, whereas a syuzhet is a perspective of those events. Formalist followers eventually translated the fabula/syuzhet to the concept of story/plot. This definition is usually used in narratology, in parallel with Forster's definition. The ''fabula'' (story) is what happened in chronological order. In contrast, the ''syuzhet'' (plot) means a unique sequence of discourse that was sorted out by the (implied) author. That is, the syuzhet can consist of picking up the fabula events in non-chronological order; for example, fabula is &lt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, …, a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;, syuzhet is &lt;a&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;.

== Structure ==
{{See also|Dramatic structure|Three-act structure}}
Today screenwriters generally combine plot with plot structure into what is called a [[Film treatment|treatment]], sometimes referred to as the three-act structure, in which a film is divided into three acts: the ''set-up'', the ''confrontation'' and the ''resolution''. Acts are connected by two [[plot point]]s or turning points, with the first turning point connecting Act I to Act II, and the second connecting Act II to Act III. The conception of the three-act structure has been attributed to American screenwriter [[Syd Field]] who described plot structure in this tripartite way for film analysis.

==Aristotle==
The Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]], writing in the fourth century BC in his classic book ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|The Poetics]]'', considered plot or ''mythos'' as the most important element of drama, even more important than character.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mack et al.|1985|pp=843–844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle wrote that a [[tragedy]], a type of plot, could be divided into three parts: a beginning, a middle, and an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mack et al.|1985|p=844}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also believed that the events of the plot must causally relate to one another as being either necessary or probable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mack et al.|1985|pp=846–847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the utmost importance is the plot's ability to arouse emotion in the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] of the audience, he thought. In [[tragedy]], the appropriate emotions are [[fear]] and [[pity]], emotions which he considers in his [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]. (Aristotle's work on comedy has not survived.)

Aristotle goes on to consider whether the tragic character [[pathos|suffers (pathos)]], and whether the tragic character commits the error with knowledge of what he is doing. He illustrates this with the question of a tragic character who is about to kill someone in his family.

::The worst situation [artistically] is when the personage is with full knowledge on the point of doing the deed, and leaves it undone. It is odious and also (through the absence of suffering) untragic; hence it is that no one is made to act thus except in some few instances, e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[Haemon]] and [[Creon]] in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''. Next after this comes the actual perpetration of the deed meditated. A better situation than that, however, is for the deed to be done in ignorance, and the relationship discovered afterwards, since there is nothing odious in it, and the discovery will serve to astound us. But the best of all is the last; what we have in [[Cresphontes]], for example, where [[Merope (wife of Cresphontes)|Merope]], on the point of slaying her son, recognizes him in time; in [[Iphigenia]], where sister and brother are in a like position; and in [[Helle (mythology)|Helle]], where the son recognizes his mother, when on the point of giving her up to her enemy.([http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-15.html Poetics book 14])

== Freytag ==
[[File:Freytags pyramid.svg|right|thumbnail|265px|Freytag's pyramid]]
{{Main|Dramatic structure}}
In 1863, Gustav Freytag, a German writer, advocated a model based upon Aristotle's theory of tragedy. This is now called "Freytag's pyramid," which divides a drama into five parts, and
provides function to each part.  These parts are: exposition (originally called introduction), rising action (rise), climax, falling action (return or fall), and denouement (catastrophe).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exposition ===
The first phase in Freytag's pyramid is the exposition, which introduces the characters, especially the main character, also known as the protagonist. It shows how the characters relate to one another, their goals and motivations, as well as their moral character. During the exposition, the protagonist learns their main goal and what is at stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=115-121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rising action ===
Rising action is the second phase in Freytag's five-phase structure. It starts with a conflict, for example, the death of a character. The inciting incident is the point of the plot that begins the conflict. It is the event that catalyzes the protagonist to go into motion and to take action. Rising action involves the buildup of events until the climax.

In this phase, the protagonist understands his or her goal and begins to work toward it. Smaller problems thwart their initial success and their progress is directed primarily against these secondary obstacles. This phase demonstrates how the protagonist overcomes these obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=125-128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climax ===
The climax is the turning point or highest point of the story. The protagonist makes the single big decision that defines not only the outcome of the story, but also who they are as a person. Freytag defines the climax as the third of the five dramatic phases which occupies the middle of the story.

At the beginning of this phase, the protagonist finally clears away the preliminary barriers and engages with the adversary. Usually, both the protagonist and the antagonist have a plan to win against the other as they enter this phase. For the first time, the audience sees the pair going against one another in direct or nearly direct conflict.

This struggle usually results in neither character completely winning or losing. In most cases, each character's plan is both partially successful and partially foiled by their adversary. The central struggle between the two characters is unique in that the protagonist makes a decision which shows their moral quality, and ultimately decides their fate. In a tragedy, the protagonist here makes a poor decision or a miscalculation that demonstrates their tragic flaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=128-130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Falling action ===
According to Freytag, the falling action phase consists of events that lead to the ending. Character's actions resolve the problem. In the beginning of this phase, the antagonist often has the upper hand. The protagonist has never been further from accomplishing their goal. The outcome depends on which side the protagonist has put themselves on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=133-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denouement===
In this phase the protagonist and antagonist have solved their problems and either the protagonist or antagonist wins the conflict. The conflict officially ends. Some stories show what happens to the characters after the conflict ends and/or they show what happens to the characters in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Freytag|1900|pp=137-140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot devices ==

{{Main|Plot device}}

A plot device is a means of advancing the plot in a story. It is often used to motivate characters, create urgency, or resolve a difficulty. This can be contrasted with moving a story forward with dramatic technique; that is, by making things happen because characters take action for well-developed reasons. An example of a plot device would be when the cavalry shows up at the last moment and saves the day in a battle. In contrast, an adversarial character who has been struggling with himself and saves the day due to a change of heart would be considered dramatic technique.

Familiar types of plot devices include the ''[[deus ex machina]]'', the [[MacGuffin]], the [[red herring]], and [[Chekhov's gun]].

== Plot outline ==
A plot outline is a prose telling of a story which can be turned into a screenplay. Sometimes it is called a "one page" because of its length. It is generally longer and more detailed than a standard synopsis, which is usually only one or two paragraphs, but shorter and less detailed than a treatment or a step outline. In comics, the roughs refer to a stage in the development where the story has been broken down very loosely in a style similar to storyboarding in film development. This stage is also referred to as storyboarding or layouts. In Japanese manga, this stage is called the ''nemu'' (pronounced like the English word "name"). The roughs are quick sketches arranged within a suggested page layout. The main goals of roughs are:

* to lay out the flow of panels across a page
* to ensure the story successfully builds suspense
* to work out points of view, camera angles, and character positions within panels
* to serve as a basis for the next stage of development, the "pencil" stage, which are detailed drawings in a more polished layout which will, in turn, serve as the basis for the inked drawings.

In fiction writing, a plot outline is a laundry list of scenes with each line being a separate plot point, and the outline helps give a story a "solid backbone and structure".

==A-Plot==
An ''A-Plot'' is a [[film|cinema]] and [[television]] term referring to the plotline that drives the story. This does not necessarily mean it is the most important, but rather the one that forces most of the action.

==Plot summary==
A plot summary is a brief description of a piece of literature that explains what happens. In a plot summary, the author and title of the book should be referred to. Also, it is no more than a paragraph long while summarizing the main points of the story. {{needs citation|date=December 2017}}

The '''Prague Philharmonia''' (''Pražská komorní filharmonie'', abbreviation: PKF; literal translation, "Prague Chamber Philharmonia") is an orchestra based in [[Prague]], the [[Czech Republic]].  The orchestra gives concerts in several venues in Prague, including the Dvořák Hall of the [[Rudolfinum]], the Church of St. Simon and Juda, the Švanda Theatre (Smíchov) and the Salon Philharmonia.  The orchestra receives government and civic sponsorship from the Czech Ministry of Culture, the City of Prague and the Prague 1 Municipal Authority.  The orchestra contains 52 musicians, as of the 2015-2016 season.

[[Jiří Bělohlávek]] founded the orchestra in 1993, after his resignation as chief conductor of the [[Czech Philharmonic]] the previous year.  The Czech Ministry of Defence had offered funding for training 40 young musicians to act as their own music ensemble, to replace the [[Prague Symphony Orchestra]] in that capacity.  Bělohlávek decided to form a new chamber orchestra instead with the funds, and had auditioned musicians for the orchestra.  However, the ministry withdrew its funding the next year.  Bělohlávek subsequently secured private funding for the orchestra,&lt;ref name="Ashley"&gt;{{cite news | author=Tim Ashley | title=The sound of freedom | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/mar/01/artsfeatures | work=The Guardian | date=2001-03-01 | accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made its public debut in 1994.  Bělohlávek served as the orchestra's first music director and chief conductor, from 1994 to 2005.  He led the orchestra in its debut at [[The Proms]] in London in July 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Erica Jeal | title=Prague Philharmonia (review of Prom 4, 2004) | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/jul/24/classicalmusicandopera.proms2004 | work=The Guardian | date=2004-07-24 | accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bělohlávek subsequently held the title of conductor laureate of the orchestra from 2005 until his death in 2017.

The Swiss conductor [[Kaspar Zehnder]] became the orchestra's second chief conductor in 2005, and [[Jakub Hrůša]] simultaneously became principal guest conductor.  Zehnder stepped down from the chief conductorshp in June 2008 at the expiration of his contract.  In March 2008, the orchestra announced the appointment of Hrůša as their third chief conductor, effective in September 2008.  Hrůša held the post through the 2014-2015 season.  In October 2014, the orchestra announced the appointment of [[Emmanuel Villaume]] as its fourth chief conductor, effective with the 2015-2016 season, with an initial contract of 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Raymond Johnston | title=PKF - Prague Philharmonia names new conductor | url=http://www.praguepost.com/142-culture/42210-pkf-prague-philharmonia-names-new-conductor | work=Prague Post | date=2014-10-22 | accessdate=2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Radio in Ireland}}
===Background===
After the [[Irish Free State]] was formed and the [[Irish Civil War]] was concluded, the new state set up a single radio channel named [[2RN]] in 1926, launched by [[Douglas Hyde]]. This was ran by the [[Irish Post Office]] and was not a private enterprise. The radio program, operating out of [[Dublin]], largely served the [[Anglophone]] population and at best reached as far as [[County Tipperary]]; a situation which did not change until more powerful transmitters were adopted in the 1930s at [[Athlone]].&lt;ref name="wat97"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/handle/10197/5703|title=A History of Irish Language Broadcasting: National Ideology, Commercial Interest and Minority Rights|author=Iarfhlaith Watson|date=1997|publisher=UCD Press|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those involved in setting up 2RN and [[J. J. Walsh]] ([[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs]] from 1923 to 1927) discussed the possibility of setting up an [[Irish-language]] radio service for the ''[[Gaeltacht]]'' community and more widely were sympathetic to Irish culture which included language revival, but the project was frustrated due to economic reasons and came to little.&lt;ref name="rte"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rte.ie/archives/2017/0228/856014-raidio-na-gaeltachta/|title=Local Radio Service at Last for An Gaeltacht 1972|author=Féach|date= 6 March 1972|publisher= RTÉ Archives|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|text=If we do not revive and develop Irish, we must inevitably be assimilated by one of these two communities ([[United Kingdom]] or the [[United States]]), or by the combined power by which they must eventually form and in that case our name and tradition and history will vanish out of human ken and our national individuality will be lost.|author=[[P. S. O'Hegarty]]|source=''Secretary of the Department for Posts and Telegraphs'', 1924.&lt;ref name="ma"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://mro.massey.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10179/1864/02_whole.pdf|title=Te Reo Pāho: Māori radio and language revitalisation|author=Rangiānehu Matamua|date=2006|publisher=Massey University|accessdate=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Éamon de Valera.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Éamon de Valera]], [[Taoiseach]] and later [[President of Ireland]], supported the idea of establishing a ''Gaeltacht'' radio station.]]
As the Irish language was valued as part of Irish national identity and a marker of the young state's independence, there were some broadcasts in the language such as ''Nuacht'' and ''Tréimhseachán Teann'' (shows with English equivalents), the latter written by [[Séamus Ó Néill]] and [[Ciarán Ó Nualláin]] (brother of [[Brian Ó Nualláin]]). These featured alongside focus on [[Gaelic games]], [[Irish traditional music]] and [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic religious]] programming as part of a general [[nation-building]] content focus. In the 1940s, there were shows which sought to proactively teach the language such as ''Is Your Irish Rusty?'' and ''Listen and Learn''.&lt;ref name="wat"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/handle/10197/5633/Watson_2002_Irish_Language_Broadcasting._Media_Culture_&amp;_Society.pdf?sequence=1|title=Irish-language broadcasting: history, ideology and identity|author=Iarfhlaith Watson|date= 2002|publisher=Sage Publications|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish-language programming suffered from a shortage of materials and for audience figures. In 1943, [[Taoiseach]] [[Éamon de Valera]] – whose wife [[Sinéad Ní Fhlannagáin]] was a keen ''[[Conradh na Gaeilge]]'' activist – promoted the idea of a ''Gaeltacht'' station again, but there was no breakthrough.&lt;ref name="rte"/&gt; By this time, 2RN had become ''[[Radio Éireann]]'' and still only had [[RTÉ Radio 1|one channel]], with limited broadcasting hours, often in competition for listeners with [[BBC Radio]] and [[Radio Luxembourg]].

In the 1950s, a general [[liberalisation]] and [[commercialisation]], indeed [[Americanisation]] began to occur in Ireland, as a push was made to move Ireland from a rural-agrarian society with a protectionist cultural policy, towards a [[market economy]] basis, with [[supply and demand]] the primarily basis of public communications. This brought Ireland into line culturally with the [[Western powers]] and eventually paved the way for its entrance into the [[European Economic Community]]. In 1960, [[RTÉ]] was established and direct control of communications moved from a government ministry position to a non-governmental [[Director-General of RTÉ|RTÉ Director-General]] position, first filled by the American, Edward Roth. Previous cultural policies, including broadcasting in Irish, reduced in percentage, as ratings and profit became key. Eventually, in the late 1960s, a civil rights movement in the ''Gaeltacht'', particularly Conamara emerged, seeking development and services for Irish-speakers, including a radio service. Out of the {{lang|ga|[[Gluaiseacht Chearta Siabhialta na Gaeltachta]]}}'s advocacy came the [[Irish pirate radio|pirate radio]] station ''[[Saor Raidió Chonamara]]'' in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ulir.ul.ie/bitstream/handle/10344/4561/OhIfearnain_2000_Irish.pdf;sequence=1|title=Irish Language Broadcast Media: The Interaction of State Language Policy, Broadcasters and their Audiences|author=Tadhg Ó hIfearnáin |date= 2000|publisher=University of Limerick|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set the subsequent discourse for Irish-language and ''Gaeltacht'' issues as a [[civil rights]] and [[minority rights]] imperative.

===Foundation===
[[File:Raidío na Gaeltachta, Casla - geograph.org.uk - 1269978.jpg|thumb|240px|Raidió na Gaeltachta headquarters in [[Casla]], [[County Galway]]. It is located in the [[Conamara]] Gaeltacht.]]
[[Gerry Collins (politician)|Gerry Collins]], the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, announced in the ''[[Dáil]]'' in February 1971 that a new radio station for the ''Gaeltacht'' would be created. ''Raidió na Gaeltachta'' began broadcasting at 3pm on 2 April 1972 as part of an [[Easter Sunday]] programming. During the very first broadcast, the main station at [[Casla]], [[County Galway]] was not yet finished and the studios in [[County Kerry]] and [[County Donegal]] were still in construction, so it was broadcast from [[Galway]]. The first ''Ceannaire'' (Controller) Pádraic Ó Raghallaigh opened the show, which was followed by a recording from President Éamon de Valera. A recording of [[Seán Ó Riada]]'s Irish-language [[Mass (music)|Mass]], ''Ceol an Aifrinn'' (which includes the hymn ''[[Ag Críost an Síol]]'') from the ''Seipéal Mhic Dara'' at [[Carraroe]] was also played.

At foundation, the station began with a staff of seven, including six former teachers and a businessman: Ó Raghallaigh, Breandán Feiritéar, Timlín Ó Cearnaigh, Máirtín Ó Fátharta, Seán Ó Tuairisg, Maidhc P. Ó Conaola, [[Mícheál Ó Sé]] and Feardorcha Ó Colla.&lt;ref name="it"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.irishtimes.com/news/raidi%C3%B3-r%C3%A9alteanna-raidi%C3%B3-na-gaeltachta-marks-40-years-1.493375|title=Raidió réalteanna: Raidió na Gaeltachta marks 40 years|author=Lorna Siggins|date= 2 April 2012|publisher= [[Irish Times]]|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, ''Raidió na Gaeltachta'' broadcast for only two hours a day&lt;ref name="gp"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gaelport.com/default.aspx?treeid=37&amp;NewsItemID=7887|title=RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta celebrates 40 years on the air|author=|date= 3 April 2012|publisher= Gaelport|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was only available in or near the three largest ''Gaeltacht'' districts. The local studio at [[Derrybeg]] in [[Gweedore]], County Donegal, under the direction of Ulstermen, Ó Cearnaigh and Ó Colla, aided the native Irish music scene there. In the 1970s, ''Raidió na Gaeltachta'' gave early coverage to [[Clannad]] and [[Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh]] (later the singer for [[Altan (band)|Altan]]). These groups would gain popularity not only in Ireland, but on the international stage, selling millions of records during the 1980s especially.&lt;ref name="it"/&gt; The station was dedicated to bringing the listener general news, both national and international (which, in the [[The Troubles|context]] of the times meant Donegal reporters with names ''as Gaeilge'' having to cross [[British Army]] checkpoints into [[Northern Ireland]]), as well as [[Gaelic sports]] coverage and more localised affairs of significance to the community in the ''Gaeltacht''.&lt;ref name="it"/&gt;

===Recent===
Following the putting in place of a fourth RTÉ national radio transmitter network (used for [[RTÉ lyric fm]]), the station expanded to 24 hours from 1 October 2001. Listenership figures are hard to come by, as the station does not make payments to be included covered in the [[Joint National Listenership Research|JNLR]] listenership survey. It is claimed that – as it doesn't carry advertising (the only Irish radio station not to do so) – paying to be included in a survey organised mainly for the benefit of the Irish advertising industry would be a pointless waste of scarce funds. It is generally believed that listenership is high amongst fluent Irish speakers but its appeal among those learning the language is not as high as [[TG4]] because (despite being available nationally) it is widely perceived as being oriented (as its name suggests) towards [[Gaeltacht]] residents.

For many years it was the only Irish-language broadcaster in the country; in recent years it has been joined by a television service, Telefís na Gaeilge ([[TG4]]), and by regional community radio stations: [[Raidió na Life]] in Dublin, [[Raidió Fáilte]] in Belfast and [[Raidió Rí-Rá]].

In March 2005, RTÉ announced that RnaG would allow songs with English lyrics to be played between 21:00 and 01:00, as part of a new popular music strand. In April 2005, it was announced that the name of this strand would be ''Anocht FM'' (Tonight FM). On weeknights the strand includes a new programme, ''Géill Slí'' (Give Way), as well as the existing long-running ''An Taobh Tuathail'' slot. ''Anocht FM'' will also be broadcast at weekends with different programmes. The new service was launched on 2 May 2005. The first track with English-language lyrics played was ''[[Blister in the Sun]]'' by the [[Violent Femmes]], chosen by public vote.

==Locations==
RnaG is based in [[Casla]], Co. Galway. It also has studios at [[Gaoth Dobhair]] (''Gweedore''), Co. Donegal; [[Ballynagall|Baile na nGall]] in [[Ard na Caithne]], Co. Kerry; [[Castlebar]], Co. Mayo; with a smaller studio in [[An Rinn]], County Waterford and the [[RTÉ Radio Centre]] in [[Dublin]]. The station is operated by RTÉ, but has a separate advisory council, Comhairle Raidió na Gaeltachta, which is appointed by the RTÉ Authority. RTÉ also appoints the Ceannaire, or Controller, of RnaG, who has day-to-day responsibility for the service.

===Funding===
The station received a total budget of €11.3 million for 2015.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

===Audience===
According to the 2011 [[Joint National Listenership Research|JNLR]] survey, RnaG has a weekly listenership of 100,000 which equates to a 3% market share.

This is similar to Welsh-language [[BBC Radio Cymru]], which has 116,000 listeners and a 2.4% share.&lt;ref&gt;https://static.rasset.ie/documents/about/18280-rte-languagescheme-bilingual-eng-v4-screen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-33794230|title=BBC Cymru Wales loses listeners|first=Huw|last=Thomas|date=6 August 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional Arts Commission is the largest funder of arts in the St. Louis region.&lt;ref name="rft-rac-2018"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.riverfronttimes.com/stlouis/the-regional-arts-commission-is-making-big-changes-with-a-bold-plan-to-transform-st-louis/Content?oid=24544473 | title=The Regional Arts Commission Is Making Big Changes, with a Bold Plan to Transform St. Louis | first=Paul | last=Friswold | date=19 September 2018 | accessdate=23 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAC has awarded more than 7,000 grants totaling more than US$300 million.&lt;ref name="rft-rac-2018" /&gt;

In 2018, the commission received $6.4 million in tax money. $3.8 million were awarded through a grants process to the arts community including 125 organizations, including the largest grantee at US$413,276 for the [[St. Louis Symphony]], and the smallest grant of US$500 to an individual working the arts. Another large portion of that money is used for a program called the Community Arts Training Institute, a program to teach people how to use use arts to effect change in their community. RAC also supports local conferences, events and workshops. And the rest of the funds support operations including salaries and building costs.&lt;ref name="rft-rac-2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stlpr-rac-2018-funds"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/regional-arts-commission-awards-38-million-grants-cuts-many-groups#stream/0 | title=Regional Arts Commission awards $3.8 million in grants, but cuts many groups | author=Jeremy D. Goodwin | date=11 July 2018 | accessdate=23 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current director is [[Felicia Shaw]] since 2015. She worked previously at San Diego's Commission for Arts and Culture as a program director. She is originally from St. Louis and moved back to St. Louis in 2018 to lead RAC.

== History ==

The Regional Arts Commission was founded in 1985.&lt;ref name="rac-official-about" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stlpublicradio-rac-2018-report" /&gt;

In 2015, Felicia Shaw took over as the director from the previous one, Jill McGuire.&lt;ref name="stlpr-rac-2018-funds" /&gt;

== Criticism ==

Shaw arrived on the job in 2015, and made it a priority to improve the transparency of the granting process and make a more fair system for dispersal of funds:

:"That anyone had the impression that their tax money was locked up in a system of nepotism, whether that's true or not, was unsustainable," Shaw explains.&lt;ref name="rft-rac-2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stlpr-rac-2018-funds" /&gt;

== Evoke, The Big Reveal and Creative Vision for St. Louis ==

In 2018, RAC led a series of sessions to get feedback from the local St. Louis community, called "Evoke", or the "Evoke Sessions".

In 2018, RAC announced in press event titled, ''The Big Reveal'', the first comprehensive creative vision for St. Louis, a 90-page report and website, created through a US$250,000 study paid for from RAC's marketing budget and corporate donations.&lt;ref name="stlpublicradio-rac-2018-call" /&gt;&lt;ref name="racstl-vision-2018"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://vision.racstl.org/vision/ | title=Regional Arts Commission calls for St. Louis arts groups to tackle social ills | author=Jeremy D.

In 2018, effects of the change in granting process effected some groups.&lt;ref name="stltoday-rac-2018-change"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/regional-arts-commission-changes-leave-theater-troupes-concerned-about-funding/article_b1984051-2132-52ff-8ce5-ee10277c555f.html| title=Regional Arts Commission changes leave theater troupes concerned about funding | first=Calvin | last=Wilson | date=17 August 2018 | accessdate=23 September 2018 | work=[[St. Louis Post Dispatch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major '''Robert Gill''' (1804–1879)&lt;ref name="Tombstone"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buckland"&gt;{{harvnb|Buckland|1906|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an army officer, [[antiquarian]], painter and photographer in [[British India]].  He is best known for his paintings copying the [[fresco]]es of the [[Ajanta caves]].  Gill was the first painter&lt;ref group=upper-alpha&gt;{{harvnb|Upadhyay|1994|p=1}} notes that Fide Jesus, a native, had drawn and lithographed these paintings before Robert Gill (c. 1836) those were published in 1847.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;–  after their rediscovery in 1819&amp;nbsp;–  to make extensive copies of the Buddhist cave paintings, which mostly date to the 5th century CE. His surviving copies and drawings remain significant in Ajanta studies as the originals have significantly deteriorated since his time.&lt;ref name="Patel"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Divia {{ndash}} Curator, Asian Department |last1=Patel |last2=Costaras |first2=Nicola {{ndash}} Head Paintings Conservator |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-52/conserving-the-copies-of-the-ajanta-cave-paintings-at-the-v-and-a/ |journal=Conservation Journal |title=Conserving the copies of the Ajanta cave paintings at the V&amp;A |publisher=[[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] |date=Spring 2006 |issue=52 |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Family and military service===
Gill was born in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], London, the son of a stockbroker. He joined the [[Madras Army|44th Madras Native Infantry]] as a cadet in 1824 and became an [[ensign (military rank)|ensign]] on 6 May 1825. Promotion to Lieutenant followed in September 1826, and to Captain on 6 May 1840; finally he was promoted to Major.  On 25 May 1841, he married Frances Flowerdew Rickerby at [[St Luke's Church, Chelsea]], in London.&lt;ref&gt;Parish registers of St Luke's, Chelsea.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madras Military Fund records (1808–1862)&lt;/ref&gt;  He was discharged as an invalid on 1 October 1852.&lt;ref name="RootsWeb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon, 234–238"&gt;Gordon, 234–238&lt;/ref&gt; His first child, a daughter called Frances Eliza Minchin Gill (1842-1930), was born in Madras. His first son, the soldier, explorer and intelligence officer [[William John Gill]] (1843-1882), was born in [[Bangalore]].  A second daughter, Rose Matilda Gill, was born in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] in 1845 but died when less than three weeks old. A second son, the lawyer Robert Thomas Gill (1847-1927) was born in [[Jalna, Maharashtra|Jaulnah]], as was a third daughter, Lucy Annie Gill (1849-1903). Robert Gill may have had several children who died in infancy by his first Indian mistress, Paro. He had two daughters by his second Indian mistress: Mildred Mary Gill (1866-1923) and Annie Gill (c.1864-1934).&lt;ref&gt;Family history research by Tony Hadland, a descendant of Robert Gill.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Gill was a member of [[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|The Royal Asiatic Society]], and this association was eventually parlayed into copying the murals that had first been published in a lecture by [[James Fergusson (architect)|James Fergusson]] to the Bombay branch of the Society, and later inclusion and illustration in his book in [[Indian rock-cut architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Fergusson's book was ''The Rock-cut Temples of India'', published in 1845. Gibson, pp 230–234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohatgi"/&gt; From 1844, Gill was taken away from military service to copy the Ajanta murals for the [[Asiatic Society of Bombay]], at an additional salary of 200 [[rupee]]s a year.  He spent thirty years measuring, mapping, cataloguing, photographing, and painting in the caves, despite dangers from wild animals and the local [[Bhil people]].&lt;ref name="Rohatgi"/&gt;

Arriving at Ajanta in early 1845, he completed an initial survey and inspection, submitting a report the same year. He began to ship completed paintings back to London in 1847, where many were exhibited at the museum of the [[East India Company]].  A number of them were reproduced, somewhat crudely, in an article in 1849 in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 235&lt;/ref&gt; He had copied about 30 of the principal [[fresco]]es on canvas at almost full-size by 1863, when the painting phase of his work largely ended; these works were sent to London.&lt;ref name="Gordon, 234–238"/&gt; Unfortunately, twenty-five of his pictures were burnt during the 1866 fire at [[The Crystal Palace]], where they were on loan and being exhibited.&lt;ref name="Buckland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohatgi"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Pauline |last1=Rohatgi |first2=Pheroza |last2=Godrej |date=March 2009 |chapter-url=http://www.illwa.org/chapter_8.htm |chapter=Reflections of Change |title=Indian Life and Landscapes by Western Artists |publisher=Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS) |location=Mumbai |access-date=24 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907050817/http://www.illwa.org/chapter_8.htm |archive-date=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was destroyed by a fire in a storeroom in the South Kensington Museum (now the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]) in 1885.  This was the same fire that destroyed most of the next generation of Ajanta copies, just completed by a team from the Bombay School of Art. None of Gill's lost copies had been photographed.  The four surviving Gill copies are in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London; a number of his drawings are in the [[British Library]].&lt;ref name="Gordon, 234–238"/&gt;

Gill remained based at Ajanta for the rest of his life, also making tours to other ancient sites in India. He took up photography, including [[stereoscopy]], in about 1856, and much of his photographic work is published in two books, ''The Rock-Cut Temples of India'',&lt;ref name="Bonhams"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/16200/lot/383/ |first1=James |last1=Ferguson |work=India and Beyond in Books and Photography |date=9 April 2008|format=[[Albumen print]]s|title=The Rock Cut Temples of India |publisher=[[Bonhams]] Auctioneer |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''One Hundred Stereoscopic Illustrations of Architecture and Natural History in Western India'', with notes by [[James Fergusson (architect)|James Fergusson]].&lt;ref name="Buckland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon, 234–238"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohatgi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, 236–238; {{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho0001000s4u00455000.html |first1=Robert |last1=Gill |title=General view of Buddhist Caves II-XXVI, Ajanta|date=26 March 2009 |format=Photographic print |publisher=British Library |accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=One hundred stereoscopic illustrations of architecture and natural history in western India |first1=Robert, photographer |last1=Gill |first2=James, description |last2=Fergusson |year=1864 |publisher=Cundall, Downes |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gill's surviving photographs, drawings, and paintings are constantly cited by scholars of Ajanta and [[Indian art]] generally, as they have preserved the memories of original painted surfaces that have undergone significant flaking.  Accelerated deterioration began immediately upon the caves' rediscovery starting in 1819. According to the Victoria and Albert Museum, even in Gill's time the original cave paintings could be seen suffering damage from frequent, unsupervised visitation and also from "swarms of bees and bats."&lt;ref name="Patel"/&gt; Gill's works also record the condition of the stonework at the time; some sections have since been lost, such as the portico to Cave 1,&lt;ref&gt;Compare [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho0001000s4u00462000.html Gill's photo] with a [[:File:AjantaHoehle1VerandaPanorama.jpg|modern view]]&lt;/ref&gt; and others considerably repaired and tidied.  Many of his plans, drawings, and photographs are available online at the [[British Library]] and other places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/index.html Search page for British Library online collections]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and burial===
Like many other British Indian officers of those days, Gill was an avid hunter and killed about 150 [[tigers]], mostly on foot.&lt;ref name="Buckland"/&gt; He died in 1879&lt;ref name="Tombstone"/&gt; while being transported from Ajanta to [[Bhusawal]] in a very ill condition,&lt;ref name="Buckland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohatgi"/&gt; and was buried at the Catholic Cemetery at Bhusawal.&lt;ref name="Gordon, 234–238"/&gt;

==Modern interpretations==
In 2012, a [[Marathi language]] film, [[Ajintha (film)|Ajintha]], was made based on his work and love story with a native girl Paro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajinthathefilm.com|title=Ajintha-the film|last=|first=|date=|year=2012|website=|publisher=Chandrakant Production Pvt.

'''Robert Wyland''' (born July 9, 1956), commonly known as '''Wyland''', is an American artist best known for his 100 [[List of Whaling Walls|''Whaling Walls'']], large outdoor murals featuring images of life-size whales, and other sea life.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Whitney (9 June 1997).

[[File:Edouard Manet 078.jpg|right|thumb|''Rochefort's Escape'']]
'''''Rochefort's Escape''''' ({{lang-fr|L'évasion de Rochefort|link=no}}) is a painting by [[Édouard Manet]] painted in around 1881, currently in the [[Kunsthaus Zürich]]. It depicts the 1874 escape of [[Victor Henri Rochefort, Marquis de Rochefort-Luçay]] from captivity in [[New Caledonia]] to which he had been sentenced for his role in the [[Paris Commune]]. The genre of [[history painting]] traditionally dealt with historic and mythological topics, and ''Rochefort's Escape'' is considered highly significant for its depiction of an event still fresh in public memory. A second smaller version of the painting is in the [[Musée d'Orsay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire_id/levasion-de-rochefort-315.html?no_cache=1|title=Musée d'Orsay: Edouard Manet Rochefort's Escape|publisher=Musée d'Orsay|accessdate=21 August 2016|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:QuietClubbing Gatsby Party 4.08.16.jpg|thumb|QuietClubbing Gatsby Party in New York on April 8, 2016]]
A '''silent disco''' or '''silent rave''' is an event where people dance to music listened to on wireless [[headphone]]s.&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/silent+disco|title=silent disco - Definition of silent disco in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than using a [[speaker system]], music is broadcast via a radio transmitter with the signal being picked up by wireless headphone receivers worn by the participants. Those without the headphones hear no music, giving the effect of a room full of people dancing to nothing.

In the earliest days of silent discos, before 2005, there would be only one channel available to listen to music through. Over time, the technology moved along to where there were two, and later technology allowed for a third channel that three separate DJs could broadcast over at the same time.

Silent discos are popular at music festivals as they allow dancing to continue past noise curfews. Similar events are "mobile clubbing" gatherings, where a group of people dance to the music on their personal music players.

==History==
[[Image:Silent house party san francisco.jpg|thumb|left|A silent house party in [[San Francisco, California]]]]
An early reference in fiction is the 1969 Finnish science-fiction film ''Ruusujen Aika'' (''A Time of Roses''), where characters wear headsets during a party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138764/|title= IMDb "A Time of Roses"|publisher=|accessdate=|last=|first= | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was used by eco-activists in the early 1990s, utilizing headphones at outdoor parties to minimize noise pollution and disturbance to the local wildlife.

In 1994, the [[Glastonbury Festival]] linked its on-site radio station to the video screen sited next to the Main Stage, allowing festival goers to watch late night [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] football and music videos on the giant screen after the sound curfew by using their own portable radios. The idea was the brainchild of the project manager from Proquip, who supplied the giant screen, and engineers from Moles Recording Studio in [[Bath, Somerset]], who were working with Radio Avalon.

In May 2000, [[BBC]] Live Music held a "silent gig" at [[Chapter Arts Centre]] in [[Cardiff]], where the audience listened to a band, Rocketgoldstar, and various DJs through headphones.&lt;ref name="BBC Music Live events unfold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/764290.stm|title=BBC News - ENTERTAINMENT - BBC Music Live events unfold|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2002 artist Meg Duguid hosted ''Dance with me...''  a silent dance party at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago]] where she created an outdoor club installation complete with velvet ropes and glow rope in which a DJ spun a transmission to wireless headsets that audience members put on and danced to.&lt;ref&gt;http:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Molzahn|first1=Laura|title=Summer Solstice Celebration|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/summer-solstice-celebration/Content?oid=908938|website=Chicago Reader|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://megduguid.com/section/149646-Dance-with-me.html|title=Dance with me...|website=megduguid.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Duguid threw a second dance party at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago]] the following year, entitled Dueling DJs where two DJS simultaneously spun two separate musical transmissions various wireless headsets that audience members put on and danced to.  This performance was repeated the following year (2004) at the [[Chicago Cultural Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dueling DJs @ Cultural Center|url=http://www.gapersblock.com/slowdown/archives/2004/12/|website=Gapers Block: Slow Down Archive|accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "silent disco" has been in existence since at least 2005 with [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] advertising such an event that year with DJ’s [[Motion Potion]], Quickie Mart and DJ medi4 and headphones provided by KOSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Netherlands, the traveling arts and culture festival De Parade already featured a "stille disco" [silent disco] earlier, for example in 2003. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmitz|first1=Jowi|title=Amsterdams Parade-publiek bekijkt zichzelf|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2003/08/05/amsterdams-parade-publiek-bekijkt-zichzelf-7649080-a812311|website=NRC.nl|publisher=NRC|accessdate=21 May 2018|language=Dutch|date=5 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch DJs Nico Okkerse and Michael Minton have been described as "the pioneers ... in the legend of silent disco" because they started "stille disco" events in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert|title=A quiet night out|url=https://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/music/a-quiet-night-out-1.499140|website=The National|publisher=The National|accessdate=21 May 2018|date=19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Okkerse claims his company 433fm.com "created Silent Disco in 2002"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nico Okkerse|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nico-okkerse-0b0191b/|website=LinkedIn|publisher=LinkedIn|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its site does have photos from such events going back to at least 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Festival de Parade Museumpark|url=http://www.radio433.com/foto/detail.php?book=20030620&amp;taal=|website=Radio433.com|publisher=433fm.com|accessdate=21 May 2018|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HUSHconcerts]] (previously, Silent Frisco) was the first company to produce a multi-city Silent Disco tour in 2008 with Silent Soundclash &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/jun/14/meltdownmassiveattack|title=Meltdown: Silent disco, big noise|last=Ojumu|first=Akin|date=2008-06-14|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; kicking off at [[Winter Music Conference]] in Miami, followed by Atlanta, Athens, Savannah, Wilmington NC, Charlottesville Va, Baltimore, New York City, Syracuse, Pittsburgh and St. Louis. During this tour, the company became the first to produce American silent discos on a beach (Miami Beach) and a boat (the Rocksoff Cruise in New York Harbor).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/news/2010/04/02/silent-soundclash-rana-eric-krasno-chapter-2-among-cruises-on-rocks-off-calendar|title=Silent Soundclash, RANA, Eric Krasno &amp; Chapter 2 Among Cruises on Rocks Off Calendar|website=www.jambands.com|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oxford Dictionary Online]] added the term "silent disco" to their website in February 2011.&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary" /&gt; As interest has increased, there has been a rise in the number of companies organizing parties and providing events with wireless headphones. Some companies have offered home kits.&lt;ref name="craze"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/6142360/Silent-disco-craze-spreads.html|title=Silent disco craze spreads|last=Johnston|first=Ian|date=6 September 2009|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile clubbing==
Another type of silent party, known as mobile clubbing, involves the gathering of a group of people in an unconventional location to dance to music which they provide themselves via a [[Portable audio player|portable music device]], such as an [[MP3 player]], listened to on headphones.  These [[flash mob]] gatherings may involve hundreds of people, transforming public spaces into temporary clubbing areas, in which dancers listen to their personal playlists.  To an observer it would appear that the participants are dancing for no apparent reason. Mobile clubbing events are organized using mass-emails, word-of-mouth or [[social networking]] websites such as [[Facebook]], or a combination of these methods.

The first event, organised by London-based artists Ben Cummins (also founder of Pillow Fight Club) and Emma Davis, was at London's [[Liverpool Street Station]] in September 2003.&lt;ref name="Mobile Clubbing website"&gt;[http://www.mobile-clubbing.com/Seedsprouts/MobileClubbing/Display/EventList.aspx?period=past Mobile Clubbing website] retrieved on 2009-02-28&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next five months there were a further five events at other London train stations including [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo]], [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] and [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]].&lt;ref name="Mobile Clubbing Instructions"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070501081916/http://www.mobile-clubbing.com/eventsWeb/public/mobileclubbing/mcInstructions.aspx Mobile Clubbing Instructions] retrieved on 2007-05-01&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2008 there had been more than twenty of these events at similar venues throughout London, mostly train station concourses or other public spaces that lend themselves to expressive dancing and rapid dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=409998&amp;in_page_id=1770|title=i-Pod flashmobbers dance in their hundreds at station|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An event in 2007 at [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]], [[London]] involved 4,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 4,000 flash mob dancers startle commuters at Victoria | first = Tim | last = Stewart | work = [[Evening Standard]] | date = 2007-04-05 | accessdate = 2007-05-03 | url = https://www.standard.co.uk/news/4000-flash-mob-dancers-startle-commuters-at-victoria-7203786.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was broken up by police two hours later.

A headphone concert is a [[live music]] performance where the audience, in the same venue as the performing artist, listens to the music through headphones.&lt;ref name="plug2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=[:]plug[:] (2005)|url=http://deletist.info/|work=deletist.info |accessdate=2016-08-23| date=2005-08-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050924230826/http://deletist.info/|archivedate=2005-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea originated in 1997 when [[Erik Minkkinen]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Sister Iodine]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="placard2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=the placard headphone festival|url=http://www.leplacard.org/|work=leplacard.org |accessdate=2005-10-26| date=2005-08-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026233655/http://www.leplacard.org/|archivedate=2005-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; an electronic artist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://v2.nl/archive/people/erik-minkkinen|title=Erik Minkkinen|website=V2_Institute for the Unstable Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/76850-Erik-Minkkinen|title=Erik Minkkinen|website=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Paris]], streamed a live concert from his closet over the internet to three listeners in Japan.&lt;ref name="wiredbyo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Axline|first=Keith|title=Fest Rocks With BYO Headphones|url=http://archive.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2005/08/68682|work=Wired.com entertainment music news|publisher=wired magazine|accessdate=2016-08-23|date=2005-08-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823160820/http://archive.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2005/08/68682|archivedate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept led to a decentralized organization known as ''le placard'' ("the Cupboard"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/#fr/en/Placard|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed anybody to establish a streaming or listening room.&lt;ref name="wiredbyo"/&gt;

The first headphone concert taking place in front of a live audience took place March 20, 1999, at the [[South by Southwest]] festival in [[Austin, Texas]]. The American psychedelic band [[The Flaming Lips]] used an FM signal generator at the venue and handed out mini [[FM radio]] receivers and headphones to each member of the audience. A normal speaker system was also used so the sound could also be felt. This continued on their "International Music Against Brain Degeneration Revue" tour with mixed results, with technical problems including dead batteries and intoxicated audience members having trouble tuning to the correct frequency.&lt;ref name="warner press archive"&gt;{{cite web|last=Booker|first=Scott|title=Partly Accurate Flaming Lips News|url=http://www.wbr.com/flaminglips/cmp/marnov99.htm|work=Archived News Relating To The Flaming Lips|accessdate=2013-02-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329221215/http://www.wbr.com/flaminglips/cmp/marnov99.htm|archivedate=2007-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another headphone concert was performed in the [[Chapter Arts Centre]], [[Cardiff]] in April 2000 by [[Rocketgoldstar]].&lt;ref name="BBC Music Live events unfold" /&gt;

Later headphone concerts used specially designed wireless 3-channel headphones, better in-house custom made transmitters and no speakers or any live PA in the venue.  Major events hosting headphone concerts included the 2005 [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[2010 Shift Festival]] in Switzerland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spirgi|first=Dominique|title=2010 Shift Festival english program|url=http://www.shiftfestival.ch/en/shift-2010/program/headphone-concerts/|work=2010 Shift Festival website|publisher=Shift  Electronic Arts Festival   Postfach CH-4023 Basel Switzerland|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2011-12 [[Van's Warp Tours]] across North America, [[Sensoria Music &amp; Film Festival|Sensoria 2012]] in [[Sheffield, UK]], the 2012 [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] in Tennessee and the [[Hoxeyville Music Fest]] in Michigan.&lt;ref name="knoxnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brimer|first=Adam|title=Bonnaroo Silent Disco Day 1|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/photos/galleries/2012/jun/07/day-1-thursday-at-bonnaroo-2012/46908/|work=knox news|publisher=Knoxnews.com|accessdate=Dec 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Kid Koala]] performed a "Space Cadet Headphone Concert tour" around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/04/kid_koala_space_cadet_headphone_experience_april_4_review.php | title = Live: Kid Koala's Space Cadet Headphone Experience Crashes In Brooklyn - New York - Music - Sound of the City | accessdate = 2013-02-21 | last = Mlynar | first = Phillip | date = 2012-04-05 | publisher = [[Village Voice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of the headphone concert involves live bands competing for the audience, who are able to choose which band's frequency to receive. In August 2008, the first silent [[Battle of the Bands]] was held at [[Barfly (club)|The Barfly]] music venue in [[Cardiff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejoycollective.co.uk/blog/uncategorized/preview-silent-gig-featuring-kutosismuscle-club-and-others-barfly-wed-13th-august|title= Silent Gig featuring Kutosis/Muscle Club and others @ Barfly : Wed 13th August |publisher=Joy Collective|accessdate=2008-08-08|last=|first= | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event featured bands going directly head-to-head, with a stage at each end of the venue, allowing gig-goers to choose which group they wished to listen to.

==Silent theatre==
Theatre and performance companies are now beginning to exploit silent disco technology as well. In 2009, with the help of SilentArena Ltd, Feral Productions began using an experimental approach – a mixture of narrative-led performance, [[sound art]] and guided exhibit. Their first performance, ''The Gingerbread House'', took the audience from The [[Courtyard, Hereford]] on a journey through a [[multi-storey car park]] in the centre of Hereford. In 2010, their second show, ''Locked (Rapunzel’s Lament)'', took place in a children’s playground, also in Hereford. Silent theatre techniques are now being used by companies in Liverpool, Birmingham and Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/leisure/reviews/4715331.Thinking_out_of_the_dramatic_box/ |title=The Gingerbread House breaks dramatic boundaries in Hereford |accessdate= |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.herefordtimes.com/leisure/theatre/8383794.New_theatre_group___s_hoping_for_another_fairytale_ending_at_The_Courtyard_in_Hereford/ |title=Feral Productions' hoping for another fairytale ending at The Courtyard in Hereford |accessdate= |last= |first= |coauthors= |date= |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 [[Lincoln Center]] staged a production of the [[Rocky Horror Picture Show]] utilizing Quiet Events Headphones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quiet Theater|url=https://quietevents.com/quiet-theater/|website=Quiet Events|publisher=Quiet Events|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where an audience wearing headphones could switch between the audio for the live performance and the soundtrack of the film version being projected behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = ‘Rocky Horror’ at Lincoln Center, With Headphones|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/10/movies/rocky-horror-in-central-park-with-headphones.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-08-09|access-date = 2015-09-25|issn = 0362-4331|first = Dave|last = Itzkoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Silent street shows ==
Street performers have used the concept as a solution to overcome bans on amplification and loudspeakers on the street. In 2016, Irish band [[Until April]] began using this for their shows on the street while touring in Germany and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/86139/galway-duo-find-novel-way-to-overcome-amplifier-bans-on-continental-europe|title=Galway duo find novel way to overcome amplifier bans on continental Europe|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Singapore Arts Festival''' ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: 新加坡艺术节) is an annual arts festival held in [[Singapore]]. Organised by the [[National Arts Council Singapore|National Arts Council]], it is one of the most significant events in the regional [[arts]] scene.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The festival, usually held in mid-year for a stretch of one month, incorporates [[theatre arts]], [[dance]], [[music]] and [[visual arts]], among other possibilities. Besides local participants, approximately 70% of the events are put up by international artists.

Today, the Singapore Arts Festival is no longer managed by the National Arts Council. It has a new name and new direction under [http://www.sifa.sg Singapore International Festival of Arts] (SIFA), organised by Arts House Limited and commissioned by National Arts Council. In 2014 - 2017, the Festival Director for Singapore International Festival of Arts is Ong Keng Sen. He designed a two-part festival with a pre-festival of ideas [https://web.archive.org/web/20161231172823/https://sifa.sg/theopen/ The O.P.E.N]. (Open, Participate, Engage, Negotiate). The O.P.E.N. runs from June - July and thereafter followed by the main festival SIFA in August and September. Details on the new Singapore International Festival of Arts can be found at [http://www.sifa.sg www.sifa.sg].

== History ==
The Singapore Arts Festival started in 1977 as a national arts festival to celebrate local arts from the diverse communities in Singapore. Over the last three decades, the Festival has played a symbiotic and catalytic role in the development of the artistic and cultural life of Singapore. It has helped to transform the city’s cultural landscape, turning it into one of Asia’s major cultural capitals today. It has influenced local artists as well as increasing public awareness and demand for the arts, spawning new cultural platforms, events, and movements that help underpin the lively cultural scene in present Singapore.  It was formed in 1999 when the existing Festival of Asian Performing Arts and the Festival of Arts were merged as an annual event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_474_2005-01-24.html | title=Singapore dance festivals | accessdate=March 31, 2011 | publisher=[[National Library Board]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215091906/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_474_2005-01-24.html | archivedate=December 15, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne''''' ({{lang-fr|Les patineurs à Longchamp}}) is an oil-on-canvas landscape painting by the French artist [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], created during the winter of 1868. The painting depicts a snowscape with a large number of Parisians, young and old, spending leisure time on a frozen park lake. Due to Renoir's strong dislike of cold temperatures and snow, the piece is one of his few [[Winter landscapes in Western art|winter landscape]]s.

==Background==
[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] (1841–1919) first met landscape painters [[Alfred Sisley]] (1839–1899), [[Claude Monet]] (1840–1926), and figure painter [[Frédéric Bazille]] (1841–1870) at the [[Atelier|art studio]] of Swiss artist [[Charles Gleyre]] in 1861.  In addition to their friendship, all would prove influential in Renoir's work. For the next several years, Renoir attended the [[École des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref name="moffett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vollard"/&gt;  He first exhibited a large painting at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1863, but destroyed his work. That same year, Renoir was living in a studio with Bazille who introduced him to [[Paul Cézanne]] (1839–1906) and [[Camille Pissarro]] (1830–1903).

An early painting, ''The Cabaret of Mère Anthony'' (1866), represents for Renoir "some of the most agreeable memories" of his life with friends at a village inn during this time.  He soon moved to the village of Chailly near [[Bourron-Marlotte|Marlotte]] and the [[forest of Fontainebleau]], and began working with model [[Lise Tréhot]] who posed for him between 1866 and 1872. Renoir began painting at La Grenouillère, a popular middle class day resort with a floating dance hall, in late 1868.&lt;ref name="moffett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vollard"&gt;Vollard, Ambroise (1925). ''Renoir: An Intimate Record''.  Courier Corporation. pp. 9–20. {{ISBN|978-0-486-26488-2}}. {{oclc|23082906}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like Monet and several other Impressionists, Renoir worked ''[[en plein air]]'', painting outdoors, but unlike Monet, who was known for painting in the cold and snow, Renoir was not fond of cold temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Karlins, N. F. (July 7, 1999). "[http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/features/karlins/karlins7-7-99.asp Winter in New York]".  ''Artnet''. Retrieved March 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Years later, he told art dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]] that he could not stand the cold: "But then, even if you can stand the cold, why paint snow?  It is a blight on the face of Nature."&lt;ref name="vollard"/&gt; Although it is unknown when his symptoms began, Renoir was known to suffer from [[rheumatoid arthritis]] from at least 1892 onward, an affliction which would severely restrict his artistic production in late life.&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/315/7123/1704|title=How Renoir coped with rheumatoid arthritis|work=BMJ|accessdate=November 23, 2015|date=December 20, 1997|first=Annelies|last=Boonen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description== 
Renoir, who was then 26 years old, painted ''Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne'' in the public park of [[Bois de Boulogne]] in Paris ''en plein air'' during the cold winter month of January 1868.&lt;ref name="sweeney"/&gt;  Newspaper accounts of the time recorded freezing temperatures allowing people to walk across the [[Seine]] and ice skate on rivers and streams.&lt;ref name="moffett"/&gt;  Due to Renoir's dislike of cold temperatures, it is one of the few winter landscapes he completed aside from a few minor studies.&lt;ref name="aic"&gt;Groom, Gloria. Jill Shaw (ed). (2014). "[https://publications.artic.edu/renoir/reader/paintingsanddrawings#section/135636 Cat. 8 Seascape, 1879: Curatorial Entry]". ''Renoir Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago''. Art Institute of Chicago. Paragraph 2, Footnote 2. {{ISBN|978-0-86559-270-4}}. {{oclc|886893978}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the painting, the park itself was relatively new, with construction beginning in 1852 under a public works program led by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]] under the direction of [[Napoleon III]]. Under [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris#Green space - the parks and gardens of Haussmann|Haussmann's renovation of Paris]],  the Bois de Boulogne was completed in 1858.&lt;ref name="moffett"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bailey"&gt;Bailey, Colin B. Christopher Riopelle (2007). ''Renoir Landscapes: 1865–1883''. National Gallery London. p. 43. {{ISBN|978-1-85709-322-3}}. {{oclc|72868889}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene is thought to have been painted near the ''Lac pour le patinage'' (Skating Lake), an artificial lake.&lt;ref&gt;Renoir Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago. [https://publications.artic.edu/renoir/reader/paintingsanddrawings#section/135638/135638_anchor Cat. 10  Near the Lake, 1879/80].&lt;/ref&gt; Renoir chose the park because he preferred painting crowds.&lt;ref name="sweeney"&gt;Sweeney, Jim (Jan–Feb 1999). "The Impressionists Paint Winter: A Special Effect". ''Weatherwise'' (Taylor &amp; Francis Group) 52 (1): 22. {{doi|10.1080/00431679909604257}}. {{issn|0043-1672}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting has an unfinished, sketch-like quality to it, in the style of a [[pochade]], but the brushwork is bold and the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] fully realized.&lt;ref name="herbert"/&gt;  The scene represents the western part of the park, using an elevated perspective. The theme evokes older Dutch [[ice skating]] landscapes made popular by painters like [[Hendrick Avercamp]] (1585–1634).&lt;ref name="moffett"&gt;[[The Phillips Collection|Moffett, Charles S.]] (ed). Lisa Portnoy Stein (1999). ''Impressionists in Winter: Effets de Neige''.

''Impressionism: Art, Leisure, and Parisian Society''. Yale University Press. pp. 147–150. {{ISBN|978-0-300-05083-7}}. {{oclc|16925240}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several dogs can be seen in the work, reflecting Renoir's thematic interest in the lives of the Parisian bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, James Henry (2003). ''Impressionist Cats &amp; Dogs: Pets in the Painting of Modern Life''. Yale University Press. pp. 73, 83. {{ISBN|978-0-300-09873-0}}. {{oclc|185936357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motif of social leisure depicted in the piece would come to define Renoir's subsequent work.&lt;ref name="moffett"/&gt;

==Other work==
[[File:Auguste Renoir - Snow-covered Landscape - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|259px|''Snowy Landscape'' (1870–75), [[Musée de l'Orangerie]], Paris]]
There are at least four known snowscapes by Renoir: ''Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne'' (1868); ''Winter Landscape'' (1868); ''Snowy Landscape'' (1870–75); and another work also titled ''Snowy Landscape'' (1875).&lt;ref group=note&gt;As cited in ''Renoir: Paintings and drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago'', paragraph 2, footnote 2: "The four known winter scenes are Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne (1868; Collection of William I. Koch [Dauberville 110]); Winter Landscape (1868; sold, Christie's, New York, Nov. 10, 1987, lot 4 [Dauberville 172]); Snowy Landscape (c. 1875; Musée National de l'Orangerie, Paris [Dauberville 177]); and Snowy Landscape (1875; sold, Sotheby's, London, Feb. 6, 2008, lot 326)."&lt;/ref&gt; Along with ''Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne'', Renoir would return to the imagery of the Bois de Boulogne years later with a large painting called ''The Morning Ride'' (1873), alternatively titled ''Madame Henriette Darras'', which was rejected by the Salon in that year.&lt;ref name="herbert"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Robert.

[[File:Ekaterina Vilkova and Igor Voynarovsky.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shooting a scene for the 2008 Russian film ''[[Stilyagi (2008 film)|Stilyagi]]]]

'''Stilyagi''' ({{lang-rus|стиляги|p=sʲtʲɪˈlʲæɡʲɪ}}, {{literally}} "stylish, style hunters") were members of a youth [[counterculture]] from the late 1940s until the early 1960s in the [[Soviet Union]].  A '''stilyaga''' ({{lang-rus|стиляга|p=sʲtʲɪˈlʲaɡə}}), was primarily distinguished by snappy clothing—preferably foreign-label, acquired from ''[[fartsovshchik]]s''—that contrasted with the communist realities of the time, and their fascination with ''[[zagranitsa]]'', modern Western music and fashions corresponding to that of the [[Beat Generation]]. English writings on Soviet culture variously translated the derogatory term as "[[dandy|dandies]]", "[[wikt:fashionista|fashionista]]s", "[[beatnik]]s", "[[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hipsters]]", "[[zoot suit]]ers", etc.

Today, the stilyagi phenomenon is regarded as one of the Russian historical social trends which further developed during the late Soviet era (notably the [[Brezhnev stagnation|Stagnation Period]]) and allowed "informal" views on life, such as [[hippie]]s, [[punk subculture|punk]]s and [[Rapping|rappers]].

==Characteristics==
Their [[apolitical]] views, neutral or negative attitudes toward Soviet [[morality]], and their open admiration of modern, especially American, lifestyles were key characteristics that slowly developed during the 1950s.

At the dawn of the [[phenomenon]], the stilyagi look was rather a caricature, inspired by movies from abroad of recent years. It resembled the [[zoot suit]] but combined different bright colors. By the late fifties, the look had evolved into something more elegant and stylish. Typical stilyagi wear included narrow pants, long jackets, narrow ties, bright-colored shirts, and thick soled shoes.

Usually stilyagi enjoyed popular American music of the 1940s, especially [[swing music|swing]] and [[boogie-woogie]], especially the music of [[Glenn Miller]], [[Benny Goodman]] and the soundtrack from the film ''[[Sun Valley Serenade]]''. The "serenade" instantly became a cult among stilyagi, and one of its songs, the famous "[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]", served as their unofficial anthem. Stilyagi developed their own styles of dance originating from [[boogie-woogie (dance)|boogie-woogie]] and later also adopted [[rock-n-roll]].

==History and legacy==
[[File:Rock on Bones2.jpg|thumb|300px|"Rock on the bones"]]
The first stilyagi were from the generation of young adults in their early twenties who had lived through the hard times of [[Great Depression|economic crisis]] and [[World War II]], leaving them perturbed about the future of their lives. Many of the young men returning from the army were heavily influenced by the contact with the foreign countries and modern [[Fads and trends|trends]] at the time. As a result, many of them wore clothes based on images from abroad (early 1940s [[romance film]]s, daily newspapers and photographs) and young women later adopted styles from modern female stereotypes too.

The main cause of this phenomenon was the struggle between [[capitalism]] and [[communism]]-led societies. The enforced uniformity of the Soviet thought and the heavy weight of its [[dictatorship]] were the only politically correct form of view, lifestyle and [[emotional expression|self-expression]] permitted during [[Stalinism]]. Therefore, the stilyagi sought to follow the modern ideology and morality in order to avoid Soviet pressure and its influence on society.

The stilyagi were largely repressed until [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death in 1953, which let the style grow into a [[counterculture]]. By 1955, the stilyagi had acquired both respect and contempt from many layers of society (especially the then emerging Soviet [[upper-middle class]], known as "[[intelligentsia]]") and were frowned upon in political instances, but had grown too many in number to be repressed. Thus, instead of trying to get rid of them, the media and politics, including journalism, eagerly mocked their style by portraying them as ridiculous as opposed to "normal" parts of Soviet society.

In the mid-1950s, many people were arrested for making musical recordings on [[Ribs (recordings)|"bones"]] (developed [[X-ray]] films).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jazz on Bones: X-Ray Sound Recordings|url=http://www.kk.org/streetuse/archives/2006/08/jazz_on_bones_xray_sound_recor_1.php|publisher=kk.org|accessdate=29 December 2010|date=August 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jazz-Rock Counterculture is Born|url=http://www.powerhat.com/tusovka/tus.ch1.html#howyoung-records |work=The Historical Political Development of Soviet Rock Music|accessdate=29 December 2010|author=Tracy Donovan Drake |archiveurl = https://swap.stanford.edu/20090621074303/http%3A//www%2Epowerhat%2Ecom/tusovka/tus%2Ech1%2Ehtml |archivedate = June 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those found guilty of manufacturing and distributing such recordings received from three to five years of imprisonment in [[labour camp]]s for [[profiteering (business)|profiteering]].

In the late 1950s, the catchphrase "Today he dances jazz, but tomorrow [he] will sell [his] homeland" (Сегодня он танцует джаз, а завтра Родину продаст), became the stilyagi's signature and the key idea underlying their social protest. Stilyagi were recognized as an official musical, artistic and pop culture movement that later took on further modern influences, notably [[rockabilly]], [[rock-n-roll]] and [[pop rock]] musical genres.

Following the [[6th World Festival of Youth and Students|international festival of 1957]], however, the USSR became more open to modern culture. The official ban on jazz music was removed, and many records became available in stores from the 1960s. Admiration of modern music, especially the rock-n-roll wave of the sixties, met more tolerance from official ideology and little active resistance. All this contributed to the decline of the movement in the early sixties, as former stilyagi abandoned the lifestyles of their youth, while the next generation felt no need to follow such a lifestyle in order to enjoy modern culture or a nonpolitical way of life.

The influence of the stilyagi movement on Soviet-Russian culture is tremendous. Many of today's most respected Russian musicians, writers, film editors and other cultural personalities belonged to the movement, or shared its free, bohemian lifestyle. There is a 2008 Russian comedy musical film, ''[[Stilyagi (film)|Stilyagi]]'', about this subculture.

{{ about|the Wisconsin mansion|the 1965 song|Summer Wind}}

'''Summerwind''', formerly known as '''Lamont Mansion''', is a ruined [[mansion]] on the shores of West Bay Lake in [[Vilas County, Wisconsin|Vilas County]], [[Wisconsin]]. Located on private land, its ruins are closed to the public. A number of [[urban legends]] and [[ghost story|ghost stories]] in [[popular culture]] have contributed to its reputation as a [[haunted house]].&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Beth|last2=Norman|first2=Michael|title=Ghosts had a favorite haunt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19851021&amp;id=Y24aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VioEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7137,598546|accessdate=24 October 2014|work=Excerpts from "Haunted Heartland"|publisher=Milwaukee Journal|date=October 21, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legends ==
According to popular accounts, Summerwind was built in the early 20th century as a fishing lodge on the edge of West Bay Lake in [[Vilas County, Wisconsin|Vilas County]], in northeastern [[Wisconsin]], and in 1916, purchased by [[Robert P. Lamont|Robert Patterson Lamont]]. According to some stories circulated, Lamont employed Chicago architects for the remodeling. Some versions of the story name the architects as [[Thomas Tallmadge|Tallmadge and Watson]]. Supposedly the renovations took two years to complete.&lt;ref name="QCT2"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Quad-City Times]]''|title=Summerwind: More ghostly than ever |first=Bill|last=Wundram|date=October 29, 1995|url=http://qctimes.com/news/opinion/editorial/columnists/bill-wundram/summerwind-more-ghostly-than-ever/article_15955edb-9e1e-5fa2-9e9d-4d07361011df.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]''|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/corey-schjoth/haunted-travel-wisconsins_b_5021201.html|title=Haunted Travel: Wisconsin's Most Notorious Haunted House |first=Corey|last=Schjoth|date=March 25, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legends include claims that Lamont fired a pistol at a [[ghost]] one night and was so frightened that he and his family abandoned the house. Other legends include claims that subsequent owners Arnold and Ginger Hinshaw were so disturbed by hauntings that Arnold suffered a "nervous breakdown" and Ginger attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="QCT1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Quad-City Times]]''|url=http://qctimes.com/news/opinion/editorial/columnists/bill-wundram/haunted-house-keeps-visitors-wondering/article_0434804e-eccb-51b1-8a18-cc3b71d20b7b.html|title=Haunted house keeps visitors wondering|first=Bill|last=Wundram|date=October 28, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WCT"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Wisconsin Trails]]'' / ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]''|url=http://www.wisconsintrails.com/travel/Wisconsins-10-most-haunted-places-228389291.html|title=Travel – Wisconsin's 10 most haunted places|first=Chad|last=Lewis|date=2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SW1&gt;{{cite book  | last =Godfrey | first =Linda S. | title =Strange Wisconsin: More Badger State Weirdness| publisher =Big Earth Publishing | year =2007 | page = 59 | isbn =978-1-931599-85-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jRBPbFHCoV4C&amp;pg=PA59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Raymond Bober ==
Although most Land O' Lakes natives refer to the property as Lamont's mansion, supernatural tales first disseminated by Ginger Hinshaw's father Raymond Bober claim the mansion was haunted and refer to it as "Summerwind".&lt;ref name="Lightning" /&gt; Some versions of the story claim that Bober purchased the property only to abandon it because the mansion's rooms had the supernatural power to change shape and dimensions at will. In 1979, Bober (writing under the [[pen name]] "Wolfgang Von Bober"), authored a book called ''The Carver Effect: A Paranormal Experience'' in which he claimed the mansion was haunted by 18th century explorer [[Jonathan Carver]].&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=boberbook&gt;{{cite book |last=Von Bober |first=Wolffgang |title=''The Carver Effect: A Paranormal Experience'' |publisher=Stackpole Books |year=1979 |isbn=0-8117-0329-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bober's narrative, the property was often unoccupied due to alleged [[supernatural]] activity and the Hinshaws could not get workers to enter the home to do remodeling work.&lt;ref name=101wismist&gt;{{cite book |last=Balousek |first=Marv |title=101 Wisconsin Unsolved Mysteries |publisher=Badger Books |date=2000-11-15 |isbn=1-878569-70-8|page= 17-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However according to one of Bober's neighbors, Bober did not live in the mansion, never spent the night in it and instead lived in a trailer on the property. At least two previous residents reportedly denied claims that the house was haunted and locals claimed the haunting stories did not begin until Bober's book was published.&lt;ref name="Razed" /&gt; A 1980 Life magazine photo essay including Summerwind among "Terrifying Tales of Nine Haunted Houses" apparently spread the supernatural tales originated in Bober's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Terrifying Tales of Nine Haunted Houses |first= Henry (Photographer) |last= Groskinsky |journal= Life Magazine |date= November 1980 |page= 152}} [http://theweirdusmessageboard.yuku.com/topic/2474/Life-Magazine-Haunted-House-Article-November-1980]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to author Marv Balousek, locals never believed the home was haunted and were dismayed when the home became somewhat of a supernatural [[tourist attraction]].&lt;ref name=101wismist /&gt;

== Fire ==
In 1985, officials for the Town of [[Land O' Lakes, Wisconsin|Land O' Lakes]] made an attempt to demolish the vacant home. The Vilas County Sheriff said it was a staging area for local teens who burglarized or vandalized nearby cottages.&lt;ref name="Razed" /&gt; This attempt failed, but the abandoned mansion was later destroyed by fire following a lightning strike on June 19, 1988. Later that week, fire officials reported that the fire was not suspicious and arson was not suspected since neighbors reported being awakened when lightning struck the vacant home. However, fire officials also said that teenagers frequently used the location for parties and that they may have left a fire burning.&lt;ref name="Lightning" /&gt;

== Potential restoration ==
In 2014, owners Harold and Babs Tracy and the Fox Valley Ghost Hunters sought funding to rebuild the mansion as a [[bed and breakfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/ghost-fans-hope-to-rebuild-mansion--haunting-and-all-b99381544z1-281025652.html |title= Ghost fans hope to rebuild mansion — haunting and all |first= Jim |last= Stingl |newspaper= Milwaukee Journal |location= [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin |date= 30 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.vilascountynewsreview.com/lifestyle/group-looking-rebuild-summerwind-sets-benefit |title= Group looking to rebuild Summerwind sets benefit |newspaper= Vilas County News-Review |date= 30 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wjfw.com/stories.html?sku=20141028184624&amp;display=video |title= Paranormal group speaking on historic Summerwind mansion |first= Hayley |last= Tenpas |website= WJFW TV-12 |location= [[Rhinelander, Wisconsin]] |date= 28 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Accordionist''''' is a 1911 [[painting]] by [[Pablo Picasso]].  As stated by the title, the painting is meant to portray a man playing an [[accordion]].  The division of three-dimensional forms into a two-dimensional plane indicate that the painting is in the style of [[analytic cubism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Voorhies|first=James|title=Pablo Picasso (1881-1973)|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pica/hd_pica.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] | year=2000 |accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed by Picasso and [[Georges Braque]] between 1907 and 1914.  The onset of cubism is possibly due to Picasso and Braque rebelling against centuries of traditional, realistic art that imitates the natural world.

In earlier stages of analytic cubism, such as Picasso's ''Carafe, Jug and Fruit Bowl'', Picasso begins to break up the subject matter and alter the sense of depth.  However, in earlier work there is still a defined sense of the subject's shape and volume.  The picture plane is distorted, but not to the same extent as later paintings such as ''The Accordionist'' which verge on complete abstraction.  Also differentiating early and late analytical cubism is the use of color.  In ''Carafe, Jug and Fruit Bowl'' Picasso uses color to define the table cloth, bowls, and fruit, allowing the viewer to easily discern the subject matter, despite the slight flattening and separation of the picture plane.  ''The Accordionist'' on the other hand is almost monochromatic which further camouflages the subject.

== The painting ==
''The Accordionist'' is 51.25&amp;nbsp;inches tall and 35.25&amp;nbsp;inches wide, painted in oil on canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Avgikos|first=Jan|title=Pablo Picasso|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/3426 |publisher=[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] |accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composition consists of a multitude of geometric shapes of various sizes and content. The shapes most densely populate the middle of the painting, fanning out in a kind of triangle shape from the top to the bottom of the painting.  Since there is no obvious subject, this composition leads the viewer’s eye around the painting in an attempt to decipher the content.

Also focused toward the center of the painting are the dark colors, which aid in drawing the viewer in to explore the painting. Picasso utilized the drab, muted tones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rewald|first=Sabine|title=Cubism|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cube/hd_cube.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to place the emphasis on the subject. Picasso’s dull palette also lends itself well to the piecing together of the different perspectives of the same subject.

== Interpretation ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
In the top middle portion of the painting there is a cluster of curvaceous shapes.  These shapes seem to form the face of the accordion player, which then leads down to the player’s body that expands out from neck to shoulders to the rest of the body.  Following the face down the painting, there is a large right angle that protrudes from the upper portion of the painting, which seems to be the player’s arm.  The arm is bent in such a manner that suggests the player is resting his arm on the arm of a chair and is sitting down.  Further suggesting that the player is seated is the round shape to the right of Picasso’s signature in the bottom left portion of the painting.  This shape looks as if it could represent the embellishment on the bottom of a chair leg.

The same kind of shape is seen on the right side of the painting and the spacing between the two encourages the viewer to see the shapes as legs to an armchair.  A little further up from the second chair leg one can see the beginnings of the accordion.  There is one fragment that has three small circles lined up in a vertical row next to what seems to be the last three fingers on a person’s hand. From the title, it can be assumed that this represents someone playing the accordion. Moving left from the hand and keys, there is a series of rectangular shapes, probably meant to depict the folds in an accordion.  The keys and folds around the player’s hand are shown from multiple viewpoints, which make it difficult to determine the exact direction of the accordion.

'''''The Case for Israel''''' is a 2003 book by [[Alan Dershowitz]], a law professor at [[Harvard University]]. The work is a response to common [[criticism of Israel|criticisms of Israel]].

''The Case for Israel'' was a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|

==Summary==
The book is divided into several chapters, each of which addresses what Dershowitz identifies as being particularly strong accusations and myths about Israel, such as "Israel is the 'prime' human rights violator in the world" and "Israel is the cause of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]." Each chapter is divided into several sections. "The Accusation" states a common criticism of Israel, "The Accusers" lists several quotations from critics supporting the accusation, "The Reality" contains a short statement contradicting the accusation, and "The Proof" contains Dershowitz's explanation of his viewpoint. [[Edward Said]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] are among the critics that he quotes the most heavily. The research assistants mentioned in the book's acknowledgements include Natalie Hershlag, the birthname of the actress [[Natalie Portman]].&lt;ref&gt;Dershowitz (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UG4_QXdpFQUC&amp;pg=PP11&amp;lpg=PP11 p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/111297/natalie-portman-and-scarlett-johansson-at-dnc "Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson at DNC"] by Yair Rosenberg, ''[[Tablet Magazine]]'', 5 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"What Natalie knows" by Evgenia Peretz, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Dershowitz has released a sequel in 2005 championing the [[two-state solution]]. The book, ''[[The Case for Peace]]'', explains what he believes is needed to be done in order to achieve peace in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].

==Norman Finkelstein's allegations of fraud==
{{see also|Dershowitz–Finkelstein affair}}
The political scientist and author [[Norman Finkelstein]] has claimed the book is a "hoax"&lt;ref name=FinkelsteinHoaxPage&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finkelstein|first1=Norman G|title=THE DERSHOWITZ HOAX|url=http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=4&amp;ar=1|publisher=Norman G.

After a heated exchange between the two on ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', in which Finkelstein repeatedly accused Dershowitz of plagiarism and questioned his credentials to teach at Harvard University,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|i-ndY4Rilyg|Finkelstein versus Dershowitz debate, part 1 of 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein released a book, ''Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History'', whose second part is about ''The Case for Israel''. The book lists many examples of text that Finkelstein claims Dershowitz to have lifted from Peters. A Harvard Law School investigation led by former Harvard president [[Derek Bok]] found the plagiarism charges to be without merit. Finkelstein later agreed to delete all references to "plagiarism" from his book, instead writing that Dershowitz "lifted" or "appropriated" text from Peters, but said he only did it to avoid a lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3113826,00.html |title=Dershowitz in plagiarism spat – Israel Jewish Scene, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/07/09/academic_fight_heads_to_print/|title=Academic fight heads to print|work=The Boston Globe|date=2005-07-09|accessdate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Oxford University]]'s professor of international relations [[Avi Shlaim]], Finkelstein's charge of plagiarism "is proved in a manner that would stand up in court.".&lt;ref name=THE2005&gt;{{cite news|title=The good Jewish boys go into battle|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/the-good-jewish-boys-go-into-battle/200412.article|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=2005-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the feud between Dershowitz and Finkelstein, Dr. Frank Menetrez, a former Editor-in-Chief of the [[UCLA Law Review]], published an analysis of the charges made against Finkelstein by Dershowitz, finding no merit in any single charge, and that, on the contrary, "Dershowitz is deliberately misrepresenting what Finkelstein wrote".&lt;ref name="Menetrez2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Menetrez|title=Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-semitism and the Abuse of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qc6Tn-C2B5UC&amp;pg=PA363|accessdate=26 May 2013|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24989-9|pages=363–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow-up analysis he concluded that he could find 'no way of avoiding the inference that Dershowitz copied the quotation from Twain from Peters's ''From Time Immemorial'', and not from the original source', as Dershowitz claimed.&lt;ref name="Menetrez2008"/&gt;

Michael Desch, political science professor at [[University of Notre Dame]] observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not only did Dershowitz improperly present Peters's ideas, he may not even have bothered to read the original sources she used to come up with them. Finkelstein somehow managed to get uncorrected page proofs of ''The Case for Israel'' in which Dershowitz appears to direct his research assistant to go to certain pages and notes in Peters's book and place them in his footnotes directly (32, col. 3).&lt;ref name=Desch&gt;[[Michael Desch|Michael C. Desch]], [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=98 "The Chutzpah of Alan Dershowitz,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327143707/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=11&amp;ar=98 |date=2006-03-27 }} ''[[The American Conservative]]'' 5 December 2005, online posting, ''normanfinkelstein.com'', accessed 10 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although repeatedly being approached by third parties to debate the book, Dershowitz refused on the ground that he had a "longstanding policy against debating [[Holocaust]] deniers, revisionists, trivializers or minimizers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Finkelstein|first=Norman G.|title=Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qc6Tn-C2B5UC&amp;pg=PR49|date=1 May 2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24989-9|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The St. Cecilia Altarpiece''''' is an [[oil painting]] by Italian [[High Renaissance]] painter [[Raphael]]. Completed in his later years, around 1516-1517, the painting depicts [[Saint Cecilia]], the [[patron saint]] of musicians and [[Church music]], listening to a choir of angels in the company of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]], [[John the Apostle|St. John the Evangelist]], [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and [[Mary Magdalene]]. Commissioned for a church in [[Bologna]], the painting now hangs there in the [[Pinacoteca Nazionale (Bologna)|Pinacoteca Nazionale]], or National Painting Gallery.  According to Vasari the musical instruments strewn about Cecilia's feet were not painted by Raphael, but by his student, [[Giovanni da Udine]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Vasari, ''Le vite de' piu eccellenti pittori, scultori ed architettori,'' ed. G. Milanesi, Milan, 1906, VI, 551.  Late in his career Raphael typically assigned portions of his works to assistants.  On this point see Andrea Emiliani," L'estasi di Santa Cecilia," in ''L'estasi di Santa Cecilia di Raffaello da Urbino nella Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna,'' ed. Andrea Emiliani, Bologna: Alfa, 1983, i-xciii,&lt;/ref&gt;

English [[Romantic poet]] [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Percy Shelley]] described the painting as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The central figure, St. Cecilia, seems rapt in such inspiration as produced her image in the painter's mind; her deep, dark, eloquent eyes lifted up; her chestnut hair flung back from her forehead — she holds an organ in her hands — her countenance, as it were, calmed by the depth of its passion and rapture, and penetrated throughout with the warm and radiant light of life. She is listening to the music of heaven, and, as I imagine, has just ceased to sing, for the four figures that surround her evidently point, by their attitudes, towards her; particularly St. John, who, with a tender yet impassioned gesture, bends his countenance towards her, languid with the depth of emotion. At her feet lie various instruments of music, broken and unstrung.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters from Italy''; quoted in Singleton (1899), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
The altarpiece was commissioned for a chapel dedicated to St. Cecilia at the Augustinian church of [[San Giovanni in Monte]] in Bologna. According to [[Vasari]] the work was commissioned by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Lorenzo Pucci]] in 1513.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, IV, 349, and III, 545; Vasari (1987), 303-304; Champlin and Perkins (1913), 261.  Pucci family documents ascribe the commission to Cardinal Lorenzo's nephew, Antonio, a canon of Florence Cathedral.  O. Pucci, "La santa Cecilia di Raffaello d'Urbino," ''Rivista Fiorentina'', I, June, 1908, 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the extraordinary popularity of the painter at this time in his career, it is likely that only such a highly placed church authority could have had any hope of hiring him.  The patron of the chapel itself, however, was Elena Duglioli dall'Olio, an aristocratic Bolognese woman who would later be beatified for her piety.  She was a close friend of Antonio Pucci, Cardinal Lorenzo's nephew, and most art historians today agree that the Pucci must have served as her agents and advisers with Raphael and that the painting was more likely commissioned for her around 1516, when construction on the chapel was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Stanislaw Mossakowski, "Raphael's ''St. Cecilia.'' An Iconographical Study," ''Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte,'' 31 (1968), 1-2; Gabriella Zarri, "L'altra Cecilia: Elena Duglioli dall'Olio (1472-1520)," in ''La Santa Cecilia di Raffaello: Indagini per un dipinto,'' ed. Andrea Emiliani (Bologna: Alfa, 1983), 81-118; Carla Bernardini, "Antefatti Bolognese: Una traccia," in ''L'estasi di Santa Cecilia di Raffaello da Urbino nella Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna,'' ed. Andrea Emiliani, Bologna: Alfa, 1983, 2-19. Historian [[Eugène Müntz]] suggested in his 1882 biography of the artist that Elena Duglioni was inspired to build a chapel by a vision, but conveyed her inspiration to her kinsman [[Antonio Pucci (cardinal)|Antonio Pucci]], who footed the bill for the chapel and convinced his uncle Lorenzo to commission the work. Müntz (1882), 525.&lt;/ref&gt; Duglioli had a particular devotion to the cult of St. Cecilia and had been given a relic (her knucklebone) by the papal legate to Bologna, [[Francesco Adiosi|Cardinal Francesco Alidosi]].  She struggled to live a chaste life in emulation of the early Christian saint and persuaded her husband not to consummate their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Mossakowski, 2; Roger Jones and Nicholas Penny, ''Raphael,'' New Haven:  Yale University Press, 1983, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was looted to [[Paris]] in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;Champlin and Perkins (1913), 261.&lt;/ref&gt; While there, it was [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas]]. In 1815, the painting was returned to Bologna where, after cleaning, and was hung in the [[Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna]]. The painting's condition is poor, as it has been damaged by repainting over the years.

==Iconography==
St. Cecilia's companions are identified in part by their attributes. Immediately to her right, John the Evangelist has an eagle, his usual symbol,&lt;ref&gt;Nici (2008), 155.&lt;/ref&gt; peeking out around his robes. Beside him, Paul leans on the sword with which he had come to be identified in medieval art.&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie (2007), 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine of Hippo holds his [[crosier]]. Mary Magdalene holds the alabaster jar by which she is most commonly identified.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner (2007), 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

The iconography of the altarpiece is unusual in that rather than portraying a figure or figures to be worshipped, it represents the act of worship itself. Each of the saints was associated with visions - as was Elena Duglioni herself - and the celestial choir that opens above the saints' heads is closely associated with the patron's own devotions, in which music was an important element.&lt;ref&gt;Mossakowski, 3-4; Jones and Penny, 146; Wolfgang Osthoff, "Raffael und die Musik", in ''Raffael in seiner Zeit'', ed. Volker Hoffman
Nurnberg: Verlag Hans Carl, 1987, 155-88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cecilia was associated with music from the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Connolly, ''Mourning into Joy:  Music, Raphael, and St. Cecilia'', New Haven:  Yale University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; but the broken instruments here appear to refer to the abandonment of earthly pleasures that resulted from Cecilia's devotion to the sacred.  In this painting she personifies religious music as a route to union with God.&lt;ref&gt;Mossakowski, 5-6, suggests the broken instruments represent "the secular music of the wedding rejected by St. Cecilia."  He goes on to note that instrumental music had, since the time of the Greeks, been less esteemed than vocal music.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting further celebrates the theme of chastity.  St. Cecilia's simple belt is a traditional Renaissance symbol for chastity;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=E.|last= Wind|title= Pagan Mysteries in the Renaissance|location= New York City|year= 1958|page= 123, note 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; John the Evangelist was the patron saint of virginity; and Paul praised celibacy in I Corinthians.  Thus the painting's iconography is closely tied to the life of the patron on many levels.&lt;ref&gt;Mossakowski further analyzes the painting as an expression of erudite [[Humanism in Italy|humanist]] ideas,&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an engraving of the painting by [[Marcantonio Raimondi]]: it differs significantly from the work, and some scholars have suggested that it reflects a lost sketch for the altarpiece.&lt;ref&gt;Müntz (1882), p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt; In it Raphael depicted the angels with instruments as well — harp, triangle and violin — and the figures are in very different poses. Augustine (wearing his [[mitre]]) and Paul look downward; John looks out towards the viewer; the Magdalene looks upward to the angelic host, as Cecilia does.  Raimondi's engravings are frequently known to alter Raphael's works, however, so it is not impossible that it represents a free variant of the finished altarpiece rather than a copy of a sketch of Raphael's initial intentions.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kristeller, "Marc-Antonios Beziehungen zu Raffael",  ''Jahrbuch der Preussischen Kunstsammlungen'', XXVIII (1907), 219-221, 228; M. Pittaluga, ''L'incisione italiana nel Cinquecento,'' 1928, pp. 144, 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Human Stain''''' is a 2003 [[drama film]] directed by [[Robert Benton]]. Its screenplay, by [[Nicholas Meyer]], is based on the [[The Human Stain|novel of the same name]] by [[Philip Roth]]. The film stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] and [[Nicole Kidman]].

==Plot==
In the late 1990s, writer [[Nathan Zuckerman]] ([[Gary Sinise]]) has settled in a lakeside [[New England]] cabin following his second divorce and a battle with [[prostate cancer]]. His quiet life is interrupted by Coleman Silk ([[Anthony Hopkins]]), a former dean and professor of classics at local Athena College, who was forced to resign after being accused of making a [[racist]] remark in class. Coleman's wife died suddenly following the scandal, and he wants to avenge his loss of career and companion by writing a book about the events with Nathan's assistance.

The project is placed on the back burner when Coleman has an affair with Faunia Farley ([[Nicole Kidman]]), a considerably younger, semi-literate woman who supports herself by working menial jobs, including at the college. Their relationship is threatened by the faculty members who forced Coleman from his job and by Faunia's [[stalker]] ex-husband Lester ([[Ed Harris]]), a mentally unbalanced [[Vietnam War]] veteran who blames her for the deaths of their children in an accident. Flashbacks of Coleman's life reveal to the audience his secret: he is an African American who has "[[passing (sociology)|passed]]" as a white Jewish man for most of his adult life.

===Critical response===
''The Human Stain'' received mixed reviews. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 41% of 148 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with a [[rating average]] of 5.5 out of 10. The site's consensus is that "Though the acting is fine, the leads are miscast, and the story is less powerful on screen than on the page."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/human_stain/ "The Human Stain"], Rotten Tomatoes&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', A.O. Scott called it "an honorable B+ term paper of a movie: sober, scrupulous and earnestly respectful of its literary source . . . The filmmakers explicate Mr. Roth's themes with admirable clarity and care and observe his characters with delicate fondness, but they cannot hope to approximate the brilliance and rapacity of his voice, which holds all the novel's disparate elements together. Without the active intervention of Mr. Roth's intelligence . . . the story fails to cohere . . . At its best - which also tends to be at its quietest - ''The Human Stain'' allows you both to care about its characters and to think about the larger issues that their lives represent. Its deepest flaw is an inability to link those moments of empathy and insight into a continuous drama, to suggest that the characters' lives keep going when they are not on screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= |author= A.O. Scott |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9505E4D81430F932A05753C1A9659C8B63|title=Movie Review - FILM REVIEW; Secrets of the Skin, And of the Heart | work = NYTimes.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' observed, "We have to suspend disbelief over the casting, but that's easier since we can believe the stories of these people. Not many movies probe into matters of identity or adaptation. Most movie characters are like [[List of Greek mythological figures|Greek gods]] and [[comic book]] heroes: We learn their roles and powers at the beginning of the story, and they never change. Here are complex, troubled, flawed people, brave enough to breathe deeply and take one more risk with their lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031031/REVIEWS/310310303/1023|title=The Human Stain Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2003) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', [[Mick LaSalle]] called it "a mediocre movie . . . [that] falls victim to a fatal lack of narrative drive, suspense and drama. Kidman and Hopkins are wrong for their roles, and that, combined with a pervading inevitability, cuts the film off from any sustained vitality. The result is something admirable but lifeless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/10/31/DD231134.DTL|title='Human Stain' doesn't quite wash / Philip Roth adaptation a nice effort but ultimately unbelievable|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Stratton]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' described it as "an intelligent adaptation of Philip Roth's arguably unfilmable novel powered by two eye-catching performances . . . A key problem Benton is unable to avoid is that Hopkins and Miller don't look (or talk) the least bit like one another. Miller, who gives a strong, muted performance, convinces as a light-skinned African-American in a way Hopkins never does, which is not to suggest that the Welsh-born actor doesn't give another intelligent, powerful portrayal. It's just that the believability gap looms large."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117921675.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0|title=Review: ‘The Human Stain’|first=David|last=Stratton|date=3 September 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] said, "Hopkins and Kidman . . . are both as mesmerizing as they are miscast . . . ''The Human Stain'' is heavy going. It's the flashes of dramatic lightning that make it a trip worth taking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/_/id/5947821/rid/5947822/|title=Movie Review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Times]]'' of London called it "sapping and unbelievable [[melodrama]] . . . an unforgivably turgid lecture about [[political correctness]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7943-971961,00.html|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Veryl Goodnight''' (born January 26, 1947) is a [[sculptor]] and since 2006 has been living in [[Mancos]], [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haydenhaysgallery.com/artist_biography/292/689/Veryl-Goodnight.html Veryl Goodnight moved 2006 to Mancos Colorado] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329172936/http://www.haydenhaysgallery.com/artist_biography/292/689/Veryl-Goodnight.html |date=March 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is known for her equine sculpture - in particular a realistic depiction of horses, often in an [[American frontier|American West]] context.&lt;ref name="aaea.net"&gt;[http://www.aaea.net/aaeamembers/goodnight/default.htm Veryl Goodnight is Member of the American Academy of Equine Art, Inc] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330162548/http://www.aaea.net/aaeamembers/goodnight/default.htm |date=March 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was inducted into the [[National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cowgirl.net/portfolios/veryl-goodnight/|title=Veryl Goodnight - Cowgirl Hall of Fame &amp; Museum|last=|first=|date=|work=Cowgirl Hall of Fame &amp; Museum|access-date=13 May 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Veryl was born in [[Ashland, Ohio]], on January 26, 1947, but her family moved to [[Lakewood, Colorado]] when she was only a few weeks old. As a young child living in the West, she fell in love with horses. Her parents could not afford to buy her one of her own, but Veryl continued to think and dream about horses. When she was very little she would sculpt horses out of snow.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Honi. Creative Rider. The Trail Rider.  2005; 16: 46-55.&lt;/ref&gt; She received from her parents her first set of professional paints when she was in third grade, and soon her home was filled with equine [[drawing]]s and [[painting]]s.&lt;ref name=horse&gt;Reynolds, Gretchen.  All the Pretty Horses.  Southwest Art.  2006; July issue: 159-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
In 1965, Veryl had the opportunity for a scholarship to study art at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]],&lt;ref name=horse/&gt; but declined because she did not wish to study [[abstract art]], which was the predominant form being taught at that time.  She attended business school in [[Denver]] instead.  During her 20s she held a steady job as a secretary while she continued to study art in her spare time. Her mentors included artists James Disney, Ned Jacob, Ken Bunn, and Jon Zahourek. She learned painting, bronze sculpture, and horse anatomy and began making and selling sculptures for a living.

== ''The Day the Wall Came Down'' ==
[[Image:TheDaytheWallcamedown.jpg|thumb|"The Day the Wall Came Down" in College Station, Texas]]
She is best known for her piece ''The Day the Wall Came Down'', a tribute to the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]]. It features five horses jumping over the rubble of the Berlin Wall.

There are two copies of the sculpture. The first, finished in 1997, is located at the [[George Bush Presidential Library]] in College Station, Texas.&lt;ref name=pc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verylgoodnight.com/PC.html|title=Veryl Goodnight: Biography|website=harwellfunderburk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, finished in 1998, was given as a gift from the [[United States|United States of America]] to [[Germany]] and is located at Clayallee near the [[Allied Museum]] in the former American sector of Berlin.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; Each sculpture weighs approximately seven tons and measures 30 feet long by 18 feet wide by 12 feet high.&lt;ref&gt;Kadash-Swan, Kathy.

'''William Kilburn''' (1745–1818) was an illustrator for [[William Curtis]]' [[Flora Londinensis]], as well as a leading designer and printer of calico. A few hundred originals of his water colour designs make up the ''Kilburn Album'', housed at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alistairkilburn.co.uk/|title=Alistair Kilburn, Artist - HOME PAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Kilburn was the son of a Dublin architect and was an apprentice to a calico printer, but spent his spare time engraving and sketching. He moved to [[Bermondsey]] after his father's death, and found living quarters near Curtis's nursery. Within a short while his skills were being used in the ''Flora Londinensis''. He soon returned to calico printing, becoming financially successful.

Kilburn was the chief petitioner in March 1787, requesting [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] for design copyright protection in the textile industry. At that time Kilburn was a calico printer at Wallington in Surrey. Ralph Yates, who was a London warehouseman, regularly sold Kilburn's designs to the firm of Peel &amp; Co. in [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] in [[Lancashire]], who would copy the design and produce a cheaper fabric that appeared in shops within a few days. Consequently, the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] proposed a [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] to control the plagiarism, a step meeting furious objections from [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Aberdeen]], [[Manchester]] and [[Lancashire]], who felt that their trade would collapse. The bill was passed in May 1787 ''"An Act for the Encouragement of the Arts of designing and printing Linens, Cottons, Callicoes and Muslins by vesting the Properties thereof in the Designers, Printers, Proprietors for a limited Time."'' This "limited Time" was a period of two months from the date of first publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=871159|title=William Kilburn and the Earliest Copyright Acts for Cotton Printing Designs|first=Ada K.|last=Longfield|date=1 January 1953|publisher=|journal=The Burlington Magazine|volume=95|issue=604|pages=230–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many of Kilburn's works are available for viewing at The Victoria and Albert Museum, in South Kensington, London. An archive of Kilburn patterns are also available from the online V&amp;A archives.

The '''[[Türkiye İş Bankası|İş Bank]] commercial featuring [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]''', the founder of [[Turkey]], first aired on Turkish television channels on 10 November 2007, coinciding with the 69th commemoration of Atatürk's death in 1938. This is reportedly the first commercial featuring Atatürk.&lt;ref name="Haberturk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haber5.com/haber.php?haber_id=298719|title=Atatürk'lü reklam filminin kamera arkası (video)|accessdate=2007-11-11|language=Turkish|publisher=[[Haber Türk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The commercial features a dialogue between a young boy and Atatürk working in a [[rose garden]]. A thorn pricks Atatürk's finger. The boy asks how a thorn ''can'' prick Atatürk's hand. Atatürk replies with the question: "can it not prick?" The boy further asks how Atatürk's hand ''can'' bleed. Atatürk replies with the question: "can it not bleed?" Shocked, the boy inquires whether he isn't Atatürk? Atatürk replies that he is indeed Atatürk. The boy, still shocked, replies "but...". Atatürk interrupts and explains that if one is going to grow a rose, one will suffer pain, one's hand will bleed, sun will make one sweat, there will be people putting to the gardener that the roses in the garden will never die, and that there will be people confronting the gardener on how a rose is supposed to be grown. Atatürk continues by saying that the boy should be asking him just one question: "Do I want to make this place a rose garden? Do I want to grow the world's most beautiful roses in this garden?" Atatürk further adds that if the boy really wishes it to be so, "he wouldn't care about neither the thorns that prick nor the words said". Atatürk continues by saying that whoever it might be, all he would care about is the scent of the rose garden. Atatürk concludes by asking, whether the boy understood the lesson and the boy acknowledges this. The commercial concludes with the statement "We respectfully commemorate Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of our country and bank".&lt;ref name="Haberturk"/&gt;

The commercial was directed by [[Gürkan Kurtkaya]] and was shot in black and white giving it a historic feel with the slogan "the roses you have grown are mourning" ({{lang-tr|Yetiştirdiğin güller bugün matemdeler}}).&lt;ref name="Haberturk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aksam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aksam.com.tr/haber.asp?a=98052,8|title=Atatürk belgeseli gibi reklam filmi|accessdate=2007-11-11|language=Turkish|publisher=[[Akşam]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071112012132/http://www.aksam.com.tr/haber.asp?a=98052,8 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preparations for the commercial lasted three weeks. The actual filming itself lasted 3 days. A technical team made out of 50 people took part in the filming. For the details of the era, [[Rıdvan Akar]] was consulted.&lt;ref name="Aksam"/&gt;

The role of the boy was acted by [[Hakan Büyüktopçu]] and the role of Atatürk was acted by [[Haluk Bilginer]]. Prior to the shooting, [[Haluk Bilginer]] received a natural make-up lasting hours.&lt;ref name="Haberturk"/&gt; Including the test shootings, Bilginer spent a total of 40 hours in the make-up room. The make-up work was conducted by [[Vittorio Sodano]] and his team. For one week, the make-up team worked in [[Italy]] for preparations and worked for another week in the set during the shootings. To convert Bilginer's face to Atatürk, first a cast was made of his face. Hair and eyebrow pieces that were prepared in Italy were put in their places by [[Suzan Kardeş]] after a 2-day worth work on them. The costumes were based on a photo from June 21, 1936 of Atatürk. Designer [[Nalan Türkoğlu]] and her team of six people created ten costumes in one week.&lt;ref name="Aksam"/&gt;

To find a suitable location for the take representing the features of the era, three separate teams searched [[İstanbul]], [[Edirne]], [[Bursa]], [[İzmir]], and [[Antalya]]. Finally [[Paşabahçe]] was the location agreement concluded with.&lt;ref name="Aksam"/&gt; A special set was made for the filming, and the take of the 107-second commercial started in the morning and lasted till later that night. After each take, Bilginer went behind camera and had inspected each plan.&lt;ref name="Haberturk"/&gt;

The resemblance of [[Haluk Bilginer]] to Atatürk featured heavily in the comments by reviewers.&lt;ref name="Hurriyet 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/7665192.asp|title=Herkes bu reklam filmini konuşuyor|accessdate=2007-11-11|language=Turkish|publisher=[[Hürriyet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting in the role of Atatürk for the first time, Bilginer himself stated that he was honored by the role and that he was very excited about getting to play it.&lt;ref name="Aksam"/&gt;

The commercial also established a candidate for the debated role of Atatürk in the upcoming movie on Atatürk.&lt;ref name="Hurriyet 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videogaleri.hurriyet.com.tr/Video.aspx?s=5&amp;vid=1838|title=Atatürk'lü reklam filmi duygulandırdı (video)|accessdate=2007-11-11|language=Turkish|publisher=[[Hürriyet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Costner]], who was in Turkey for a concert, declined this post, reportedly asking whether there wasn't a Turkish actor for the role.&lt;ref name="Haberturk"/&gt; The commercial portraying [[Turkey]] as a rose garden also demonstrates the difficulties Atatürk coped with in founding the republic and [[Atatürk's Reforms|his reforms]].&lt;ref name="ozturk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ozturkler.com/tr/index.php?deger=hgoster&amp;id=195076|title=İş Bankası'nın Atatürk reklamı herkesi ağlattı|accessdate=2007-11-11|language=Turkish|publisher=ozturkler.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
