'''Amelogenin, Y isoform''' is a [[protein]] that in humans is encoded by the ''AMELY'' (amelogenin, Y-linked) [[gene]].&lt;ref name="pmid2004775"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakahori Y, Takenaka O, Nakagome Y | title = A human X-Y homologous region encodes "amelogenin" | journal = Genomics | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 264–9 |date=February 1991 | pmid = 2004775 | doi = 10.1016/0888-7543(91)90251-9| url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="entrez"&gt;{{cite web | title = Entrez Gene: amelogenin| url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/265| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMELY is a gene which encodes a form of [[amelogenin]] found on the [[Y chromosome]]. Amelogenin is a member of a family of [[extracellular matrix]] proteins. They are involved in biomineralization during tooth enamel development.  Mutations in the related [[AMELX]] gene on the [[X chromosome]] cause X-linked [[amelogenesis imperfecta]].&lt;ref name="entrez"/&gt;

An '''aerospace manufacturer''' is a company or individual involved in the various aspects of [[Aircraft design process|designing]], building, testing, selling, and maintaining [[aircraft]], [[aircraft part]]s, [[missile]]s, [[rocket]]s, or [[spacecraft]]. [[Aerospace]] is a [[high tech]]nology industry.{{according to whom|date=September 2017}}

The '''aircraft industry''' is the [[industry]] supporting [[aviation]] by building [[aircraft]] and manufacturing [[aircraft parts]] for their maintenance.  This includes aircraft and parts used  for [[civil aviation]] and [[military aviation]]. Most production is done pursuant to [[type certificate]]s and [[Defense Standard]]s issued by a government body. This term has been largely subsumed by the more encompassing term: "[[aerospace]] industry".

== Market ==

In 2015 the Aircraft Production was worth $180.3 Billion: 61% [[airliner]]s, 14% business and [[general aviation]], 12% [[Military aircraft]], 10% military [[rotary wing]] and 3% civil rotary wing; while their [[aircraft maintenance|MRO]] was worth $135.1 Bn or ${{#expr:180.3+135.1}} Bn combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.aeromontreal.ca/download/fca8adddfff353/01-MRO+Industry+Outlook_Kevin+Michaels.pdf |title= MRO Industry Outlook |author= Kevin Michaels |publisher= ICF International |date= April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global aerospace industry was worth $838 billion in 2017: Aircraft &amp; Engine [[OEM]]s represented 28% (${{#expr:838*.28round0}} Bn), Civil &amp; Military MRO &amp; Upgrades 27% (${{#expr:838*.27round0}} Bn), Aircraft Systems &amp; Component Manufacturing 26% (${{#expr:838*.26round0}} Bn), [[Satellite]]s &amp; Space 7% (${{#expr:838*.07round0}} Bn), [[Missile]]s &amp; [[UAV]]s 5% (${{#expr:838*.05round0}} Bn) and other activity, including [[flight simulator]]s, defense electronics, public research accounted for 7% (${{#expr:838*.07round0}} Bn).&lt;ref name=Industry-2017/&gt;
The countries with the largest industry were led by the [[United States]] with $408.4 Bn ({{#expr:408.4/8.38round0}}%) followed by [[France]] with $69 Bn ({{#expr:69/8.38round1}}%) then [[China]] with $61.2 Bn ({{#expr:61.2/8.38round1}}%), [[United Kingdom]] with $48.8 Bn ({{#expr:48.4/8.38round1}}%), [[Germany]] with $46.2 Bn ({{#expr:46.2/8.38round1}}%), [[Russia]] with $27.1 Bn ({{#expr:27.1/8.38round1}}%), [[Canada]] with $24 Bn ({{#expr:24/8.38round1}}%) and [[Japan]] with $21 Bn ({{#expr:21/8.38round1}}%).&lt;ref name=Industry-2017&gt;{{cite web |url= https://aerodynamicadvisory.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AeroDynamic-Teal_Global-Aerospace-Industry_16July2018.pdf |title= The Global Aerospace Industry Size &amp; Country Rankings |date= 16 July 2018 |publisher= The Teal Group / AeroDynamic Advisory |authors= [[Richard Aboulafia]] and Kevin Michaels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the new commercial aircraft value is projected for $270.4 billion while [[business aircraft]] will amount for $18 billion and civil helicopters for $4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/commercial-spending-will-lead-mro-field-2018 |title= Commercial Spending Will Lead MRO Field In 2018 |at= Comparing civil, helicopter, business aviation and military MRO forecasts for 2018 |date= Jan 2, 2018 |author= Lee Ann Shay |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
In September 2018, [[PwC]] ranked aerospace manufacturing attractiveness: the most attractive country was the [[United States]], with $240 billion in sales in 2017, due the sheer size of the industry (#1) and educated [[workforce]] (#1), low [[geopolitical]] risk (#4, #1 is [[Japan]]), strong [[transportation infrastructure]] (#5, #1 is [[Hong Kong]]), a healthy [[economy]] (#10, #1 is [[China]]), but high [[costs]] (#7, #1 is [[Denmark]]) and average [[tax policy]] (#36, #1 is [[Qatar]]).&lt;!--&lt;ref name=PwCsep2018&gt;--&gt;
Following were [[Canada]], [[Singapore]], [[Switzerland]] and [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=PwCsep2018&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industrial-products/publications/assets/pwc-aerospace-manufacturing-attractiveness-rankings-2018.pdf |title= Aerospace manufacturing attractiveness rankings |date= September 2018 |publisher= PwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the US, the most attractive was [[Washington state]], due to the best Industry (#1), leading Infrastructure (#4, [[New Jersey]] is #1) and Economy (#4, [[Texas]] is #1), good labor (#9, [[Massachusetts]] is #1), average tax policy (#17, [[Alaska]] is #1) but is costly (#33, [[Montana]] is #1).&lt;!--&lt;ref name=PwCsep2018&gt;--&gt;
Washington is tied to [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes]], earning $10.3 billion, is home to 1,400 aerospace-related businesses, and has the highest aerospace jobs concentration.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=PwCsep2018&gt;--&gt;
Following are Texas, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Arizona]] and [[Colorado]].&lt;ref name=PwCsep2018/&gt;

In the [[European Union]], aerospace companies such as [[Airbus]], [[BAE Systems]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], [[Dassault Group|Dassault]], [[Saab AB]], [[Terma A/S]] and [[Leonardo S.p.A.|Leonardo]] are participants in the global aerospace industry and research effort.

In [[Russia]], large aerospace companies like [[Oboronprom]] and the [[United Aircraft Corporation]] (encompassing [[Mikoyan]], [[Sukhoi]], [[Ilyushin]], [[Tupolev]], [[Yakovlev]], and [[Irkut (company)|Irkut]], which includes [[Beriev]]) are among the major global players in this industry.

In the US, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and [[NASA]] are the two biggest consumers of aerospace technology and products.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}} The Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States reported that the aerospace industry employed 444,000 wage and salary jobs in 2004, many of which were in Washington and California,{{citation needed|date=January 2009}} this marked a steep decline from the peak years during the [[Reagan Administration]] when total employment exceeded 1,000,000 aerospace industry workers.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Dana T. ''Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II,'' pp. 131-2, Cypress, CA, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

During that period of recovery a special program to restore U.S. competitiveness across all U.S. industries, [[Project Socrates]], contributed to employment growth as the U.S. aerospace industry captured 72 percent of world aerospace market.  By 1999 U.S. share of the world market fell to 52 percent.

=== Cities ===

Important locations of the civil aerospace industry worldwide include [[Seattle]], [[Wichita, Kansas]], [[Dayton, Ohio]] and [[St. Louis]] in the United States ([[Boeing]]), [[Montreal]] and [[Toronto]] in Canada ([[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]], [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada]]), [[Toulouse]] in France and [[Hamburg]] in Germany ([[Airbus]], [[EADS]]), the North-West of England and [[Bristol]] in Britain ([[BAE Systems]], [[Airbus]] and [[AgustaWestland]]), [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]] and [[Irkutsk]] in Russia ([[Sukhoi]], [[Beriev]]), [[Kiev]] and [[Kharkiv]] in Ukraine ([[Antonov]]), [[Nagoya]] in Japan ([[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Aerospace]] and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Aerospace]]), as well as [[São José dos Campos]] in Brazil where [[Embraer]] is based.

== Consolidation ==

Several consolidations took place in the aerospace and defense industries over the last few decades.

[[BAE Systems]] is the successor company to numerous British aircraft manufacturers which merged throughout the second half of the 20th century. Many of these mergers followed the [[1957 Defence White Paper]].

[[Airbus]] prominently illustrated the European airliner manufacturing consolidation in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name=AvWeek12jul2018/&gt;

Between 1988 and 2010, more than 5,452 [[mergers and acquisitions]] with a total known-value of US$579 billion were announced worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://imaa-institute.org/m-and-a-by-industries/#mergers-acquisitions-industry-Aerospace-Defense |title= Mergers &amp; Acquisitions - Aerospace &amp; Defense |work= Thomson Financial, Institute for Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, then [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Les Aspin]] and his deputy [[William J. Perry]] held the "Last Supper" at [[the Pentagon]] with contractors executives who were told that there were twice as many military suppliers as he wanted to see: $55 billion in military-industry mergers took place from 1992 to 1997, leaving mainly  [[Boeing]], [[Lockheed Martin]] and [[Raytheon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/27/business/shrinking-military-complex-after-cold-war-pentagon-just-another-customer.html |title= The Shrinking Military Complex; After the Cold War, the Pentagon Is Just Another Customer |author= Leslie Wayne |newspaper= New York Times |date= Feb 27, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Boeing]] bought [[McDonnell Douglas]] for US$13.3 billion in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/16/business/boeing-offering-13-billion-to-buy-mcdonnell-douglas-last-us-commercial-rival.html |title=
Boeing offering $13 billion to buy McDonnell Douglas |work= New York Times |date= Dec 16, 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Raytheon]] acquired [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] for $9.5 billion in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/raytheon-wins-bidding-war-for-hughes-aircraft-1467/ |title= Raytheon wins bidding war for Hughes Aircraft |date= 22 January 1997 |work= Flight International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marconi Electronic Systems]], a subsidiary of the [[General Electric Company plc]], was acquired by [[British Aerospace]] for US$12.3 billion in 1999 merger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/all-uk-merger-sends-european-defence-into-disarray-47309/ |title= All-UK merger sends European defence into disarray |date= 27 January 1999 |work= Flight International}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form [[BAE Systems]].

In 2002, when [[Fairchild Dornier]] was [[bankrupt]], Airbus, Boeing or Bombardier declined to take the [[728JET]]/928JET large [[regional jet]] program as [[Mainline (aeronautics)|mainline]] and regional aircraft manufacturers were split and Airbus was digesting its ill-fated [[Fokker]] acquisition a decade earlier.&lt;ref name=AvWeek12jul2018/&gt;

The Oct. 16, 2017 announcement of the [[CSeries]] partnership between [[Airbus]] and [[Bombardier Aerospace]] could trigger a daisy chain of reactions towards a new order.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek18oct2017/&gt;--&gt; 
Airbus gets a new, efficient model at the lower end of the [[narrowbody]] market which provides the bulk of [[airliner]] profits and can abandon the slow selling [[Airbus A319|A319]] while Bombardier benefits from the growth in this expanded market even if it holds a smaller residual stake.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek18oct2017/&gt;--&gt;
Boeing could forge a similar alliance with either [[Embraer]] with its [[E-jet E2]] or [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] and its [[Mitsubishi Regional Jet|MRJ]].&lt;ref name=AvWeek18oct2017&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/opinion-c-series-deal-ends-aerospace-status-quo |title= Opinion: C Series Deal Ends Aerospace Status Quo |date= Oct 18, 2017 |author= Jerrold T. Lundquist |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December, Boeing and Embraer confirmed to be discussing a potential combination with a transaction subject to Brazilian government regulators, the companies’ boards and shareholders approvals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/boeing-embraer-mull-combination-could-reset-oem-industry |title= Boeing, Embraer Mull Combination That Could Reset OEM Industry |date= Dec 21, 2017 |author=  Michael Bruno and Guy Norris |work= Aviation Week Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The weight of [[Airbus and Boeing]] could help E2 and CSeries sales but the 100-150 seats market seems slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-mergers-may-fuel-long-awaited-e2-and-cseri-449225/ |title= Mergers may fuel long-awaited E2 and CSeries sales bump |date= 6 June 2018 |author= Jon Hemmerdinger |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the CSeries, renamed A220, and E-jet E2 are more capable than their predecessors, they moved closer to the lower end of the [[narrowbody|narrowbodies]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek12jul2018&gt;--&gt;
In 2018, the four Western airframers combined into two within nine months as Boeing acquired 80% of Embraer's airliners for $3.8 billion on July 5.&lt;ref name=AvWeek12jul2018&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/aerospace-consolidation-anew-now-it-s-commercial-airframers |title= Aerospace Consolidation Anew: Now It’s The Commercial Airframers |date= Jul 12, 2018 |author= Jens Flottau |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suppliers ==

The largest aerospace suppliers are [[United Technologies]] with $28.2 Billion of revenue, followed by [[GE Aviation]] with $24.7 Billion, [[Safran]] with $22.5 Billion, [[Rolls-Royce Holdings]] with $16.9 Billion, [[Honeywell Aerospace]] with $15.2 Billion and [[Rockwell Collins]] including  [[B/E Aerospace]] with $8.1 Billion.&lt;ref name=AW170120&gt;{{cite new |url= http://aviationweek.com/connected-aerospace/tier-1-consolidation-continues-safran-takes-over-zodiac |title= Tier 1 Consolidation Continues As Safran Takes Over Zodiac |date= Jan 20, 2017 |author= Thierry Dubois and Jens Flottau |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[electric aircraft]] development could generate large changes for the aerospace suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/industry-landscape-could-reboot-under-aircraft-electrification |title= Industry Landscape Could Reboot Under Aircraft Electrification |date= Dec 6, 2017 |author= Michael Bruno |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November 2018, United Technologies announced the completion of its Rockwell Collins acquisition, renaming systems supplier UTC Aerospace Systems as [[Collins Aerospace]], for $23 billion of sales in 2017 and 70,000 employees, and $39.0 billion of sales in 2017 combined with engine manufacturer [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.utc.com/News/News-Center/Pages/United-Technologies-Announces-Intention-to-Separate-Into-Three-Independent-Compan.aspx |title= United Technologies Announces Intention to Separate Into Three Independent Companies; Completes Acquisition of Rockwell Collins |date= November 26, 2018 |publisher= United Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supply chain==

Before the 1980s/1990s, aircraft and aeroengine manufacturers were [[vertically integrated]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek18may2017/&gt;--&gt;
Then [[Douglas aircraft]] outsourced large [[aerostructure]]s and the [[Bombardier Global Express]] pioneered the “Tier 1” [[supply chain]] model inspired by [[automotive industry]], with 10-12 risk-sharing [[limited partners]] funding around half of the development costs.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek18may2017/&gt;--&gt;
The [[Embraer E-Jet]] followed in the late 1990s with fewer than 40 primary suppliers. &lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek18may2017/&gt;--&gt;
Tier 1 suppliers were led by [[Honeywell]], [[Safran]], [[Goodrich Corporation]] and [[Hamilton Sundstrand]].&lt;ref name=AvWeek18may2017/&gt;

In the 2000s Rolls-Royce reduced its supplier count after bringing in automotive supply chain executives.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek18may2017/&gt;--&gt;
On the [[Airbus A380]], less than 100 major suppliers outsource 60% of its value, even 80% on the [[A350XWB]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek18may2017/&gt;--&gt;
[[Boeing]] embraced an aggressive Tier 1 model for the [[B787]] but with its difficulties began to question why it was earning lower margins than its suppliers while it seemed to take all the risk, ensuing its 2011 ''Partnering for Success'' initiative, as [[Airbus]] initiated its own ''Scope+'' initiative for the [[A320]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek18may2017/&gt;--&gt;
Tier 1 consolidation also affects engine manufacturers : [[GE Aviation]] acquired [[Avio]] in 2013 and [[Rolls-Royce plc]] is taking control of [[Industria de Turbo Propulsores]].&lt;ref name=AvWeek18may2017&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/beware-oem-supplier-relations-are-changing |title= Beware, OEM-supplier Relations Are Changing |date= May 18, 2017 |author= Kevin Michaels |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anton Stefanov Mitov''' (Bulgarian: Антон Стефанов Митов; 1 April 1862, [[Stara Zagora]] - 20 August 1930, [[Sofia]]) was a Bulgarian painter, art critic, art historian, social activist and corresponding member of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]].

==Biography ==
When he was fifteen, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] troops burned his hometown and massacred over 14,000 people. His  family fled to [[Svishtov]], where they lived in poverty. He took a job as a clerk in Romania and remained there until Bulgaria was [[Liberation of Bulgaria|liberated]] in 1878, returning home determined to be an artist. In 1881, after working as a telegraph operator for two years, he saved enough money to enroll at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze]] where he studied under the direction of [[Giuseppe Ciaranfi]]. Upon his return home, he worked as a journalist and a teacher in Stara Zagoda, [[Plovdiv]], [[Varna]] and Sofia.

In 1896, he was one of the co-founders of the [[National Academy of Arts]]&lt;br /&gt; in Sofia, where he taught art history, drawing and perspective. He served two terms as its Director, from 1912 to 1918, and from 1924 to 1927. In 1898, he was part of a team of artists that decorated the [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Sofia|Alexander Nevsky Cathedral]]. One of the first Bulgarian painters to exhibit internationally, he played a decisive role in dispelling the image of his country as a cultural backwater.

He was also active in the nation's political and cultural life, making contributions to many newspapers such as ''Balkan Dawn'', ''Evening Post'' and ''World'' as well as the magazine ''Art'' (usually under pseudonyms, such as "Tonino" and "Arnold"). He also lectured extensively and did book illustrations (those for ''[[Under the Yoke]]'' by [[Ivan Vazov]] are, perhaps, best known).

Among his works are the first [[seascape]]s painted in Bulgaria, although he specialized in [[Genre art|genre]] art and portraits. A street in Plovdiv is named after him. His brother [[Georgi Mitov|Georgi]] was also a well-known painter.

'''Asana''' is an [[archaeological site]] by the [[Asana River]], a tributary of the [[Osmore River]], in the south-central [[Andes]] of southern [[Peru]].{{sfn|Kennett|Winterhalder|2006|page=172}} The site is situated at an elevation of {{convert|3430|m}}, with land use documented from {{convert|3000|-|4800|m}}. Asana was occupied over the course of 8,000 years; though the inhabitants were initially mobile foragers, long term habitation was marked at a later phase by residential architecture.{{sfn|Kennett|Winterhalder|2006|page=180}}
[[File:Huemul.jpg| right|thumb|Taruca (''[[Hippocamelus antisensis]]'') in the northern [[Andean mountains]].]]

==Geography==
Asana is located on the north bank of the Asana River in the flat fertile valley along {{Convert|11270|ft}} of the river. The geological and [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] features are causative factors for its unique setting.{{Sfn|Aldenderfer|1998|p=29}}

==History==
An archaeological study of the Asana river valley was conducted 1986–89. The area studied was along a river length of about {{Convert|20|km}}, between Tumilaca Molina and Cueva Quellaveco and from the origin of the minor tributary of the river Charoque to Tala village. The valley floors and hill slopes, covering an area of {{Convert|4.8|km2}}, led to the discovery of the Asana site and also six rock shelters.{{Sfn|Aldenderfer|1998|pp=57–58}} One of the rock shelters, Qusquri ''(Coscori)'', was discovered on the left bank of the river valley at an elevation of {{Convert|3000|m}}, in a series of river terraces at an elevation range of {{Convert|3500|-|3600|m}}.{{Sfn|Aldenderfer|1998|p=56}}

Human habitation has been traced to 10,500 [[ASPRO chronology|BP]] at Asana. Excavations have revealed six stratigraphic zones from 10,500 BP to 3500 BP, before the site became abandoned in 3500 BP. The period from 10,500 BP to 9,000 BP is interpreted as belonging to the [[Late Pleistocene]] age, 800 years prior to any type of permanent habitation in other areas of the south central Andean highlands.{{Sfn|Andrea|2011|p=153}} During the settlement period, [[guanaco]] (''Lama guanicoe'') and [[taruca|taruka]] (''[[Hippocamelus antisensis]])'' were the local wild [[herbivore]]s. Over the centuries, the guanaco were domesticated. The Asana at the lower elevation had formed the base camp of the earliest settlers who were hunter gatherers, hunting guanaco and taruca.

[[File:Kotosh.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kotosh]] style of structure of the pre-historic period|191x191px]]
[[Lithic stage|Lithic]] material found at the site attests to the shifting of camps and supports links existing between the settlements of the lower and upper elevations. Both residential and non-residential structures were found and indicated a complex type of growth and occupancy. Structure were dated between 5500–3600 BP. A ceremonial structure was found in an open air pre-ceramic site during excavations conducted from 1989–90. It is inferred that activities occurred at the ceremonial site during a 250–500-year period; it is the earliest structure noted of the [[Kotosh Religious Tradition]]. A feature identified as a "dance ground", dated to 4800 BP, was thought to be used for "feasts and social exchanges".&lt;ref name=Change&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Continuity and Change in Ceremonial Structures at Late Preceramic Asana, Southern Peru|first=Mark |last=Aldenderfer|journal=Latin American Antiquity|volume=2|issue=3 |date=September 1991|pages= 227&amp;ndash;258|jstor=972170|doi= 10.2307/972170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1490">In [[electronic engineering]], a '''bridging fault''' consists of two signals that are connected when they should not be. Depending on the [[logic circuit]]ry employed, this may result in a [[wired-OR]] or [[wired-AND]] logic function. Since there are O(n^2) potential bridging faults, they are normally restricted to signals that are physically adjacent in the design.

==Modeling bridge fault==
Bridging to VDD or Vss is equivalent to stuck at fault model. Traditionally bridged signals were modeled with logic AND or OR of signals. If one driver dominates the other driver in a bridging situation, the dominant driver forces the logic to the other one, in such case a ''dominant bridging fault'' is used. To better reflect the reality of CMOS VLSI devices, a ''dominant AND or dominant OR bridging fault model'' is used where dominant driver keeps its value, while the other signal value is the result of AND (or OR) of its own value with the dominant driver.

      <comment>/* Second wave of migration */ Reword</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4552">{{refimprove|date=August 2007}}

In the late 1950s a number of European countries (most notably [[West Germany]] and France) decided on a migration policy known as the '''buffer theory'''.

Owing to rapid economic recovery in the post World War II period (aided by the American [[Marshall Plan|Marshall plan]]) there were many more job vacancies than people who were available or becoming available in the workforce to fill them. To resolve this situation they decided to "import" workers from the southern Mediterranean basin (including North Africa) on a temporary capacity to fill this labour shortfall.

These workers were invitees of the governments and came to Europe initially on the understanding that they could at any point in time in the future be repatriated if and when economic circumstances changed. These [[Gastarbeiter]] as they became known in Germany were mainly young unskilled males who very often left their families behind in their country of origin and migrated alone as 'Economic Migrant'. They worked predominantly in certain areas of the economy where working conditions were poorer than those of indigenous Germans and where the rates of pay were considerably lower. Ultimately they came to predominate in low paid service rated employment. The situation remained unchanged until the 1970s [[economic recession]].

Jobs were being lost in manufacturing and industry in particular but not necessarily in the occupational types in which the migrants worked. In 1974 the then West German government imposed a ban restricting any future economic migrants and offered the possibility of returning to their country of origin to many others, few migrants took up the offer and stayed at their jobs or began to receive unemployment assistance from the state. This led to increased tensions and feeling of resentment from many German people.

==Second wave of migration==

Throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s [[family reunification]] took place between Turkish migrants workers and their families. This reunification however took place in Germany rather than in Turkey. In a difficult economic climate after the [[1973 oil crisis]] it was generally believed by most Turks already in Germany that their economic circumstances would be measurably better there than back in Turkey at such a difficult time. The [[welfare state]] offered considerable financial support to all people within Germany including immigrants communities. The number of foreign residents therefore increased in absolute terms during this time period.

The German government's offer to repatriate people back to their home country was not very successful. This created a difficult situation for the German government which became increasingly worse as the number of immigrants swelled to their highest levels ever. Any resentment, hostility and bitterness already present between indigenous Germans and the Turkish community became progressively worse. This often culminated in physical attacks on immigrants, arson and overt racial discrimination. There was a feeling amongst Germans that "they have taken our jobs", but this situation only arose because of Germans themselves losing their jobs in industry and manufacturing in particular in the difficult economic situation post 1973. (NB This 'family reunification' corresponds with the second wave on the [[Everett S. Lee model of migration]]).

==Third wave of migration==
Dates to the period from 1989 onwards with the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] and the communist regimes in Eastern Europe. East Germans flooded into West Germany along with many ethnic Germans from central and eastern Europe. Germany accepted them as they were political refugees and very often [[asylum seekers]].

The '''Centre for Nanoscience and Quantum Information''' (informally, '''NSQI''') is a research centre within the [[University of Bristol]]. The centre was initially built as an intra-university facility, but was absorbed into the portfolio of the School of Physics in 2016. The centre officially opened in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2009/6531.html| title = Official opening of the Centre for Nanoscience &amp; Quantum Information| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = University of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Centre was designed to provide a unique ultra-low-vibration research space, making the labs some of the quietest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.capitasymonds.co.uk/news__events/news/quietest_building_in_the_world.aspx| title = 'Quietest building in the world' officially opens| accessdate = 8 November 2011| publisher = Capita Symonds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://physicsworld.com/blog/2009/09/visting_the_quietest_building.html| title = Visiting the quietest building in the world| accessdate = 10 November 2011 | publisher = Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== The Building ==

=== Building layout ===
The building is split across four floors:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/nsqi-centre/facilities/| title = Facilities at the Centre for Nanoscience &amp; Quantum Information| accessdate = 3 November 2011| publisher = NSQI, University of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Basement: is entirely for the most sensitive experimental work, with seven low noise labs, two ultra-low noise labs, an [[anechoic chamber]] and a class 1000 [[cleanroom]], as well as three prep labs. 
* Ground Floor: has two Quantum Information labs (with less stringent noise requirements), staff offices (including an office dedicated for users of the [[NanoESCA]] facility contained in the NSQI basement) plus a seminar room and large, bright, open foyer and coffee area.
* First Floor: houses researchers, students and operations staff associated with [[QETLabs]], the [[QE-CDT]] and affiliated quantum technologies groups.
* Second Floor: contains another office and a large Quantum Engineering Technology lab; a main interdisciplinary communal lab containing a clean room area and several annex labs. 
* Third Floor: location of the main switch room and plant room for all the Centre services (water tanks, boilers, air handling units etc.).

=== Building design features ===
The building was designed by Percy Thomas of Capita Architecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.capitaarchitecture.co.uk/capita.html| title = Capita Architecture| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = Capita Architecturel}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 and built by Willmott Dixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.willmottdixongroup.co.uk/assets/h/i/highereducationbrochure.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110409174626/http://www.willmottdixongroup.co.uk/assets/h/i/highereducationbrochure.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 9 April 2011| title = Higher Education Profile| page = 11| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = Willmott Dixon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary requirement for the building was that it be a low-[[noise]] research environment, stable enough to allow researchers to take measurements at subnanometre and subnanoNewton resolution, despite other activities going on around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/jan/05/quietest-building-chemists-physicists-engineers| title = Delicate science| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = The Guardian| location=London| first=Louise| last=Tickle| date=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria set for the research space exceeded any standard curve (VC curves) and required significant design and engineering solutions.

==== Low vibrations ====
The primary source of noise for researchers at the [[nanoscale]] is mechanical [[vibration]]. Activities within a building generate noise that can travel through the structure and vibrations created outside (such as from road traffic) can travel through the ground and enter the building. A variety of methods were employed to reduce vibration generation, travel and entry into the lab space:

* The main structure of the building is massive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.naturalarchitecture.co.uk/project_scientific_1.htm| title = New centre for Nano-science and Quantum Information, University of Bristol| accessdate = 7 November 2011| publisher = Natural Architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2.0 m-thick concrete foundations and 0.5 m-thick concrete floors.
* All plant machinery is removed to the third floor, as far from the lab space as possible.
* All services and plant machinery is suspended on springs, rubber pads or damper pads to reduce coupling between the mechanism and the building.
* All services are balanced to reduce turbulence within pipe and ductwork.
* All corridors are floating, separate from the main structure, stopping vibrations crossing the floor and major foot traffic from affecting the building.
* The lift shaft is decoupled from the building structure.
* The building is decoupled from the building next door.
* All services pass through a flexible hose coupling before entering the low noise labs.
* All Low noise labs have a seven tonne concrete isolation block set on damper pads, within the ground slab. This is the experimental space, with lower vibrations than the surrounding floor and allowing experiments to continue while the researcher walks around within the lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/nsqi-centre/facilities/lownoise.html| title = Low noise lab facilities at the Centre for Nanoscience &amp; Quantum Information| accessdate = 3 November 2011| publisher = NSQI, University of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both ultra-low noise labs have either a 23-tonne or 27-tonne concrete isolation block supported by [[pneumatic]] rams. The block is T-shaped in cross-section, to keep the centre of gravity lower (reducing wobble within the block). The block is surrounded by a floating floor, so that researchers can use the room while experiments are taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.bris.ac.uk/nsqi-centre/facilities/ultra-lownoise.html| title = Ultra low noise lab facilities at the Centre for Nanoscience &amp; Quantum Information| accessdate = 3 November 2011| publisher = NSQI, University of Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To further reduce the noise in the ultra-low noise labs, control equipment can be removed from the room and installed in the neighbouring control room. The control room has its own isolation block and is heavily soundproofed. Conduits allow cables to run between the labs, allowing the experiment to be completely run from the control room.
*

==== Soundproofing ====
Acoustic noise within the building is countered through several measures. Most importantly, experimental rooms are far from the busy University precinct, underground and in an area that is not used for teaching, or as a thoroughfare. The thickness of the floor ensures that little sound penetrates across and the walls between labs and doors of the labs are soundproof. The plant machinery is removed as far from the labs as possible, on the top floor, and the services are tuned as precisely as possible to reduce any sounds from the water supply, chilled water system or air vents.

==== Low electrical noise ====
Many of the experiments planned for the Centre involve recording tiny electrical currents (as low as a few picoAmps) so electrical noise is seen as a serious problem. Each basement research lab is a full [[Faraday cage]], all service pipework changes to plastic before entering the lab and no [[Category 5 cable]] (cat5e) is used in data network, [[optical fibre]] is used instead. All labs are also supplied with an independent earth and 'clean' power supply, the mains having been filtered by a 1:1 [[transformer]].

==== Interdisciplinary space ====
In addition to providing state-of-the-art low noise spaces, the building is also designed to encourage collaboration and interdisciplinary research. This includes plenty of meeting spaces and a light &amp; spacious foyer/coffee area.

In [[electrical engineering]], a '''common rail''' (shortened to '''COM''') is a shared path between different electrical routes in an [[electrical circuit]]. For example, a device or circuit board might have a power rail or a [[Ground (electricity)|ground]] rail, which components are attached to, so all the electrical charge flowing through different components is drawn from/collected into a single conductor line. The [[ATX]] standard for [[Personal computer|PC]] [[Power supply unit|power supplies]] defines a set of common rails as to ground the power, these rails are designated as COM and all have black wires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinouts.ru/Power/atx_v2_pinout.shtml |title=ATX 24 pin power supply connector pinout diagram @ |publisher=Pinouts.ru |date=2013-08-24 |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21361">'''Darcy's law''' is an equation that describes the flow of a [[fluid]] through a [[porous]] medium. The law was formulated by [[Henry Darcy]] based on the results of experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darcy|first=H.|date=1856|title=Les fontaines publiques de la ville de Dijon|publisher=Dalmont|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the flow of [[water]] through beds of [[sand]], forming the basis of [[hydrogeology]], a branch of [[earth science]]s.

== Background ==
Darcy's law was determined experimentally by Darcy. It has since been derived from the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] via [[Homogenization (mathematics)|homogenization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Whitaker |first = S. |title = Flow in porous media I: A theoretical derivation of Darcy's law |journal = Transport in Porous Media |volume = 1 |pages = 3–25 |doi = 10.1007/BF01036523 |year = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is analogous to [[Fourier's law]] in the field of [[heat conduction]], [[Ohm's law]] in the field of [[electrical networks]], or [[Fick's law]] in [[diffusion]] theory.

One application of Darcy's law is to analyze water flow through an [[aquifer]]; Darcy's law along with the equation of [[conservation of mass]] are equivalent to the [[groundwater flow equation]], one of the basic relationships of [[hydrogeology]].

[[Morris Muskat]] first{{Citation needed|reason=Adrian E. Scheidegger (The physics of flow through porous media) says that the notion of permeability was introduced by P.G.Nutting|date=October 2018}} refined Darcy's equation for single phase flow by including viscosity in the single (fluid) phase equation of Darcy, and this change made it suitable for the petroleum industry. Based on experimental results worked out by his colleagues Wyckoff and Botset, Muskat and Meres also generalized Darcy's law to cover multiphase flow of water, oil and gas in the porous medium of a petroleum reservoir. The generalized multiphase flow equations by Muskat and others provide the analytical foundation for reservoir engineering that exists to this day.

== Description ==
[[Image:Darcy's Law.svg|thumb|right|300px|Diagram showing definitions and directions for Darcy's law.]]

Darcy's law, as refined by [[Morris Muskat]], in the absence of [[Gravity |gravitational forces]], is a simple proportional relationship between the instantaneous flow rate through a porous medium of permeability &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the [[viscosity]] of the fluid and the pressure drop over a given distance in a homogeneously permeable medium &lt;ref&gt; {{ cite journal|title= Evaporation limited radial capillary penetration in porous media | journal= Langmuir | year=2016 | volume=32 |issue=38 | pages= 9899–9904|url=http://drgan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/040_Langmuir_2016.pdf | doi=10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b02404

: &lt;math&gt;Q=-\frac{k A \left(p_\mathrm{b} - p_\mathrm{a}\right)}{\mu L}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation, for single phase (fluid) flow, is the [[defining equation (physics)|defining equation]] &lt;ref&gt;Amin F. Zarandi, Krishna M. Pillai, Adam S. Kimmel, "Spontaneous imbibition of liquids in glass-fiber wicks. Part I: Usefulness of a sharp-front approach". American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE Journal. 63: 294–305, 2018. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aic.15965/full DOI:10.1002/aic.15965] &lt;/ref&gt;for absolute permeability (single phase permeability).
The total discharge, {{mvar|Q}} (units of volume per time, e.g., m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s) is equal to the product of the intrinsic [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]] of the medium, 
{{mvar|k}} (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the cross-sectional area to flow,
{{mvar|A}} (units of area, e.g., m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),  and the total pressure drop {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; − ''p''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}} (pascals), all divided by the [[viscosity]], 
{{mvar|μ}} (Pa·s) and the length over which the pressure drop is taking place {{mvar|L}} (m).

The negative sign is needed because fluid flows from high pressure to low pressure.  Note that the [[Hydraulic head|elevation head]] must be taken into account if the inlet and outlet are at different elevations. If the change in pressure is negative (where {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;}}), then the flow will be in the positive {{mvar|x}} direction. There have been several proposals for a [[constitutive equation]] for absolute permeability, and the most famous one is probably the [[Kozeny–Carman equation|Kozeny equation]] (also called [[Kozeny–Carman equation]]).

Dividing both sides of the equation by the area and using more general notation leads to

: &lt;math&gt;q=-\frac{k}{\mu} \nabla p\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|q}} is the flux (discharge per unit area, with units of length per time, m/s) and {{math|∇''p''}} is the [[pressure gradient]] vector (Pa/m).  This value of flux, often referred to as the Darcy flux or Darcy velocity, is not the velocity which the fluid traveling through the pores is experiencing.  The fluid velocity ({{mvar|v}}) is related to the Darcy flux ({{mvar|q}}) by the [[porosity]] ({{mvar|φ}}). The flux is divided by porosity to account for the fact that only a fraction of the total formation volume is available for flow. The fluid velocity would be the velocity a conservative tracer would experience if carried by the fluid through the formation.

: &lt;math&gt;v=\frac q \varphi \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Darcy's law is a simple mathematical statement which neatly summarizes several familiar properties that [[groundwater]] flowing in [[aquifer]]s exhibits, including:
* if there is no pressure gradient over a distance, no flow occurs (these are [[hydrostatics|hydrostatic]] conditions),
* if there is a pressure gradient, flow will occur from high pressure towards low pressure (opposite the direction of increasing gradient — hence the negative sign in Darcy's law),
* the greater the pressure gradient (through the same formation material), the greater the discharge rate, and
* the discharge rate of fluid will often be different — through different formation materials (or even through the same material, in a different direction) — even if the same pressure gradient exists in both cases.

A graphical illustration of the use of the steady-state [[groundwater flow equation]] (based on Darcy's law and the conservation of mass) is in the construction of [[flownet]]s, to quantify the amount of [[groundwater]] flowing under a [[dam]].

Darcy's law is only valid for slow, [[viscous]] flow; however, most groundwater flow cases fall in this category. Typically any flow with a [[Reynolds number]] less than one is clearly laminar, and it would be valid to apply Darcy's law.  Experimental tests have shown that flow regimes with Reynolds numbers up to 10 may still be Darcian, as in the case of groundwater flow.  The Reynolds number (a dimensionless parameter) for porous media flow is typically expressed as

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re} = \frac{\rho v d_{30}}{\mu}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|ρ}} is the [[density]] of [[water]] (units of mass per volume), {{mvar|v}} is the specific discharge (not the pore velocity — with units of length per time),  {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;30&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a representative grain diameter for the porous media (often taken as the 30% passing size from a [[grain size]] analysis using sieves — with units of length), and {{mvar|μ}} is the [[viscosity]] of the fluid.

== Derivation ==
For stationary, creeping, incompressible flow, i.e. {{math|{{sfrac|''D''(''ρu&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'')|''Dt''}} ≈ 0}}, the Navier–Stokes equation simplifies to the [[Stokes flow|Stokes equation]]:

: &lt;math&gt; \mu\nabla^2 u_i +\rho g_i -\partial_i p=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|μ}} is the viscosity, {{math|u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the velocity in the {{mvar|i}} direction, {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the gravity component in the {{mvar|i}} direction and {{mvar|p}} is the pressure. Assuming the viscous resisting force is linear with the velocity we may write:

: &lt;math&gt;-\left(k_{ij}\right)^{-1} \mu\varphi u_j+\rho g_i-\partial_i p=0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|φ}} is the [[porosity]], and {{mvar|k&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the second order permeability tensor. This gives the velocity in the {{mvar|n}} direction,

: &lt;math&gt;k_{ni}\left(k_{ij}\right)^{-1} u_j= \delta_{nj} u_j = u_n = -\frac{k_{ni}}{\varphi\mu} \left(\partial_i p-\rho g_i\right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which gives Darcy's law for the volumetric flux density in the {{mvar|n}} direction,

: &lt;math&gt;q_n=-\frac{k_{ni}}{\mu}\left(\partial_i p -\rho g_i\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[isotropy|isotropic]] [[porous medium|porous media]] the off-diagonal elements in the permeability tensor are zero, {{math|''k&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}} for {{math|''i'' ≠ ''j''}} and the diagonal elements are identical, {{math|''k&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''k''}}, and the common form is obtained

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{q}=-\frac{k}{\mu}\left(\boldsymbol{\nabla} p -\rho \boldsymbol{g}\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The above equation is a [[governing equation]] for single phase fluid flow in a porous medium.

== Additional forms of Darcy's law ==

=== Darcy's law in petroleum engineering ===
Another derivation of Darcy's law is used extensively in [[petroleum engineering]] to determine the flow through permeable media — the most simple of which is for a one-dimensional, homogeneous rock formation with a single fluid phase and constant fluid [[viscosity]].

: &lt;math&gt;Q= \frac {k A}{\mu} \left( \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} \right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|Q}} is the [[Volumetric flow rate|flowrate]] of the formation (in units of volume per unit time), {{mvar|k}} is the [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of the formation (typically in [[millidarcy]]s), {{mvar|A}} is the cross-sectional [[area]] of the formation, {{mvar|μ}} is the [[viscosity]] of the fluid (typically in units of [[Poise (unit)|centipoise]]). {{math|{{sfrac|∂''p''|∂''x''}}}} represents the pressure change per unit length of the formation.  This equation can also be solved for permeability and is used to measure it, forcing a fluid of known viscosity through a core of a known length and area, and measuring the pressure drop across the length of the core.

Almost all oil reservoirs have a water zone below the oil leg, and some have also a gas cap above the oil leg. When the reservoir pressure drops due to oil production, water flows into the oil zone from below, and gas flows into the oil zone from above (if the gas cap exists), and we get a simultaneous flow and immiscible mixing of all fluid phases in the oil zone. The operator of the oil field may also inject water (and/or gas) in order to improve oil production. The petroleum industry is therefore using a generalized Darcy equation for multiphase flow that was developed by [[Morris Muskat|Muskat]] et alios. Because Darcy's name is so widespread and strongly associated with flow in porous media, the multiphase equation is denoted [[Darcy's law for multiphase flow]] or generalized Darcy equation (or law) or simply Darcy's equation (or law) or simply flow equation if the context says that the text is discussing the multiphase equation of [[Morris Muskat|Muskat]] et alios. Multiphase flow in oil and gas reservoirs is a comprehensive topic, and one of many articles about this topic is [[Darcy's law for multiphase flow]].

=== Darcy–Forchheimer law ===
For flows in porous media with [[Reynolds number]]s greater than about 1 to 10, [[inertial]] effects can also become significant. Sometimes an [[inertial]] term is added to the Darcy's equation, known as [[Philipp Forchheimer|Forchheimer]] term. This term is able to account for the [[non-linear]] behavior of the pressure difference vs flow data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bejan|first=A.|date=1984|title=Convection Heat Transfer|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}=-\frac{\mu}{k}q-\frac{\rho}{k_1}q^2\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where the additional term {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is known as inertial permeability.

The flow in the middle of a sandstone reservoir is so slow that Forchheimer's equation is usually not needed, but the gas flow into a gas production well may be high enough to justify use of Forchheimer's equation. In this case the inflow performance calculations for the well, not the grid cell of the 3D model, is based on the Forchheimer equation. The effect of this is that an additional rate-dependent skin appears in the inflow performance formula.

Some carbonate reservoirs have lots of fractures, and Darcy's equation for multiphase flow is generalized in order to govern both flow in fractures and flow in the matrix (i.e. the traditional porous rock). The irregular surface of the fracture walls and high flow rate in the fractures, may justify use of Forchheimer's equation.

=== Darcy's law for gases in fine media (Knudsen diffusion or Klinkenberg effect) ===
For gas flow in small characteristic dimensions (e.g., very fine sand, nanoporous structures etc.), the particle-wall interactions become more frequent, giving rise to additional wall friction (Knudsen friction).  For a flow in this region, where both [[viscous]] and [[Knudsen diffusion|Knudsen]] friction are present, a new formulation needs to be used. [[Martin Knudsen|Knudsen]] presented a semi-empirical model for flow in transition regime based on his experiments on small capillaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cunningham|first1=R. E.|last2=Williams|first2=R. J. J.|date=1980|title=Diffusion in Gases and Porous Media|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carrigy2013JES&gt;{{cite journal |last = Carrigy |first = N. |last2=Pant |first2=L. M. |last3=Mitra |first3=S. K. |last4=Secanell |first4=M. |title = Knudsen diffusivity and permeability of pemfc microporous coated gas diffusion layers for different polytetrafluoroethylene loadings |journal = Journal of the Electrochemical Society |volume =160 |issue = 2 |pages=F81–89 |doi=10.1149/2.036302jes |year = 2013|url=https://zenodo.org/record/895693}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a porous medium, the Knudsen equation can be given as &lt;ref name=Carrigy2013JES /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N=-\left(\frac{k}{\mu}\frac{p_a+p_b}{2}+D_\mathrm{K}^\mathrm{eff}\right)\frac{1}{R_\mathrm{g}T}\frac{p_\mathrm{b}-p_\mathrm{a}}{L}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|N}} is the molar flux, {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the gas constant, {{mvar|T}} is the temperature, {{math|''D''{{su|b=K|p=eff}}}} is the effective Knudsen diffusivity of the porous media. The model can also be derived from the first-principle-based binary friction model (BFM).&lt;ref name=Pant2012JPS&gt;{{cite journal |last = Pant |first = L. M. |last2=Mitra |first2=S. K. |last3=Secanell |first3=M. |title = Absolute permeability and Knudsen diffusivity measurements in PEMFC gas diffusion layers and micro porous layers |journal = Journal of Power Sources |volume = 206 |pages = 153–160 |doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.099 |year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Kerkhof |first = P. |title = A modified Maxwell–Stefan model for transport through inert membranes: The binary friction model |journal = Chemical Engineering Journal and the Biochemical Engineering Journal |volume = 64 |issue = 3 |pages = 319–343 |doi=10.1016/S0923-0467(96)03134-X |year = 1996|url = https://research.tue.nl/nl/publications/a-modified-maxwellstefan-model-for-transport-through-inert-membranes--the-binary-friction-model(6a85d50a-d4e3-454f-bb83-f60770375bc0).html |format = &lt;!-- Submitted manuscript --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The differential equation of transition flow in porous media based on BFM is given as&lt;ref name=Pant2012JPS /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}=-R_\mathrm{g}T\left(\frac{k p}{\mu}+D_\mathrm{K}\right)^{-1}N\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is valid for [[capillary|capillaries]] as well as porous media. The terminology of the Knudsen effect and Knudsen diffusivity is more common in [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[chemical engineering]]. In geological and petrochemical engineering, this effect is known as the [[Klinkenberg correction|Klinkenberg effect]]. Using the definition of molar flux, the above equation can be rewritten as

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}=-R_\mathrm{g}T\left(\frac{k p}{\mu}+D_\mathrm{K}\right)^{-1}\dfrac{p}{R_\mathrm{g}T}q\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be rearranged into the following equation

: &lt;math&gt; q=-\frac{k}{\mu}\left(1+\frac{D_\mathrm{K}\mu}{k}\frac{1}{p}\right)\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing this equation with conventional Darcy's law, a new formulation can be given as

: &lt;math&gt; q=-\frac{k^\mathrm{eff}}{\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;k^\mathrm{eff}=k\left(1+\frac{D_\mathrm{K}\mu}{k}\frac{1}{p}\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to the effective permeability formulation proposed by Klinkenberg:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last = Klinkenberg |first = L. J. |title = The permeability of porous media to liquids and gases |publisher = American Petroleum Institute |booktitle = Drilling and Production Practice |pages = 200–213 |year = 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;k^\mathrm{eff}=k\left(1+\frac{b}{p}\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|b}} is known as the Klinkenberg parameter, which depends on the gas and the porous medium structure. This is quite evident if we compare the above formulations. The Klinkenberg parameter {{mvar|b}} is dependent on permeability, Knudsen diffusivity and viscosity (i.e., both gas and porous medium properties).

=== Darcy's law for short time scales ===
For very short time scales, a time derivative of flux may be added to Darcy's law, which results in valid solutions at very small times (in heat transfer, this is called the modified form of [[Fourier's law]]),

: &lt;math&gt;\tau \frac{\partial q}{\partial t}+q=-k \nabla h\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|τ}} is a very small time constant which causes this equation to reduce to the normal form of Darcy's law at "normal" times (&gt; [[nanosecond]]s). The main reason for doing this is that the regular [[groundwater flow equation]] ([[diffusion equation]]) leads to [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] at constant head boundaries at very small times. This form is more mathematically rigorous, but leads to a [[hyperbolic function|hyperbolic]] groundwater flow equation, which is more difficult to solve and is only useful at very small times, typically out of the realm of practical use.

=== Brinkman form of Darcy's law ===
Another extension to the traditional form of Darcy's law is the Brinkman term, which is used to account for transitional flow between boundaries (introduced by Brinkman in 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Brinkman |first = H. C. |title = A calculation of the viscous force exerted by a flowing fluid on a dense swarm of particles |journal = Applied Scientific Research |volume = 1 |pages = 27–34 |doi = 10.1007/BF02120313 |year = 1949|citeseerx = 10.1.1.454.3769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;),

: &lt;math&gt;-\beta \nabla^2 q +q =-\frac{k}{\mu} \nabla p\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|β}} is an effective [[viscosity]] term.  This correction term accounts for flow through medium where the grains of the media are porous themselves, but is difficult to use, and is typically neglected. For example, if a porous [[extracellular matrix]] degrades to form large pores throughout the matrix, the viscous term applies in the large pores, while Darcy's law applies in the remaining intact region. This scenario was considered in a theoretical and modelling study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wertheim|first=Kenneth Y.|last2=Roose|first2=Tiina|date=April 2017|title=A Mathematical Model of Lymphangiogenesis in a Zebrafish Embryo|journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology|volume=79|issue=4|pages=693–737|doi=10.1007/s11538-017-0248-7|issn=1522-9602|pmc=5501200|pmid=28233173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the proposed model, the Brinkman equation is connected to a set of [[Reaction-diffusion-advection equation|reaction-diffusion-convection equations]].

==Validity of Darcy's law==
Darcy's law is valid for [[laminar flow]] through [[sediment]]s. In fine-grained sediments, the dimensions of [[wikt:interstice#Noun|interstices]] are small and thus flow is laminar. Coarse-grained sediments also behave similarly but in very coarse-grained sediments the flow may be [[turbulent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jin|first1=Y.|last2=Uth|first2=M.-F.|last3=Kuznetsov|first3=A. V.|last4=Herwig|first4=H.|title=Numerical investigation of the possibility of macroscopic turbulence in porous media: a direct numerical simulation study|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|date=2 February 2015|volume=766|pages=76–103|doi=10.1017/jfm.2015.9|bibcode = 2015JFM...766...76J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence Darcy's law is not always valid in such sediments.
For flow through commercial circular pipes, the flow is laminar when Reynolds number is less than 2000 and turbulent when it is more than 4000, but in some sediments it has been found that flow is laminar when the value of Reynolds number is less than 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arora|first=K. R.|date=1989|title=Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering|publisher=Standard Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schema of the layers of the graphical user interface.svg|thumb|300px|The basic components of a [[graphical user interface|GUI]]: The '''display server''' implements the [[windowing system]]. A simple [[window manager]] merely draws the [[window decoration]]s, but compositing window managers do more.]]

A '''display server''' or '''window server''' is a program whose primary task is to coordinate the input and output of its clients to and from the rest of the operating system, the hardware, and each other. The display server communicates with its clients over the display server protocol, a [[communications protocol]], which can be network-transparent or simply network-capable.

The display server is a key component in any [[graphical user interface]], specifically the [[windowing system]].

== Available display server communications protocols ==

=== X11 ===
{{Main article|X Window System core protocol|X Window System}}
[[File:X11 display server protocol.svg|thumb|350px|The [[X.Org Server]] communicates with its clients, e.g. [[Amarok (software)|Amarok]], over the X11 protocol]]
&lt;div class="tright" style="clear:none"&gt;[[File:X11.svg|right|60px|X Window System logo]]&lt;/div&gt;

One example of a display server is the [[X.Org Server]], which runs on top of the kernel (usually a [[Unix]]-based kernel, such as [[Linux]] or [[BSD]]). It receives user input data (e.g. from [[evdev]] on Linux) and passes it to one of its clients. The display server also receives data from its clients; it processes the data, it does the compositing and on Linux it passes the data to one of three kernel components &amp;ndash; [[Direct Rendering Manager|DRM]], [[Graphics Execution Manager|gem]] or [[KMS driver]]. The component writes the data into the [[framebuffer]] and content of the framebuffer is transmitted to the connected screen and displayed. X relies on [[GLX]].

One of the implementations of display server concept is [[X Window System]], in particular its actually used version &amp;ndash; [[X.Org Server]] and [[Xlib]] and [[XCB]] client libraries. The X.Org Server is a display server, but in its current implementation it relies on a second program, the [[compositing window manager]], to do the compositing. Examples are [[Mutter (window manager)|Mutter]] or [[KWin]].

Notable examples of display servers implementing the X11 display server protocol are [[X.Org Server]], [[XFree86]], [[XQuartz]] and [[Cygwin/X]], while client libraries implementing the X11 display server protocol are [[Xlib]] and [[XCB]].

One tool called &lt;tt&gt;[[xev (unix)|xev]]&lt;/tt&gt; is a [[Unix command]] which creates a window and then asks the display server to send information of events every time something happens to the window (like if it's resized, if any keys are pushed, if it's clicked it etc.) to the console.

=== Wayland ===
{{Main article|Wayland (display server protocol)}}
[[File:Wayland display server protocol.svg|thumb|300px|The Wayland display server protocol]]
&lt;div class="tright" style="clear:none"&gt;[[File:Wayland Logo.svg|right|60px|Wayland logo]]&lt;/div&gt;

Display servers that implement the Wayland display server protocol, are called [[Wayland compositor]]s. Like any display server, a Wayland compositor is responsible for handling input and output for its clients and – in contrast to X11 – additionally for the [[compositing]]. Examples are [[Weston (software)|Weston]], [[Mutter (software)|Mutter]], [[KWin]] or [[Enlightenment (software)|Enlightenment]].

Wayland compositors communicate with Wayland clients over the [[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland display server protocol]]. This protocol defines that clients can directly write data into the framebuffer using the [[EGL (OpenGL)|EGL]] [[rendering API]]. The display server still gets to decide which window is on top and thus visible to the user and also still is responsible for passing data regarding to input devices from [[evdev]] to its clients.

Wayland is used to a certain degree in some Linux desktop distributions, such as [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://blogs.gnome.org/mclasen/2016/03/04/why-wayland-anyway/ | title = Why Wayland Anyway? | work = Goings On | publisher = Matthias Clasen | accessdate = 2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also well suited for mobile computing and has been adopted, for example, by the smartphone- and tablet-focused projects [[Tizen]] and [[Sailfish OS]].

An implementation of Wayland is available under the [[MIT License]], the [[libwayland-client]] and libwayland-server libraries.

There is an ongoing effort to add Wayland support to [[Chrome OS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/ozone_overview.md | title = Ozone Overview | accessdate = 2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mir ===
{{Main article|Mir (display server)}}

The [[Mir (software)|Mir display server]] comes with its own Mir display server protocol which is different from those used by X11 and Wayland. Mir additionally supports the X11 protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://samohtv.wordpress.com/2013/03/04/mir-an-outpost-envisioned-as-a-new-home/|title=[Updated] Mir – An outpost envisioned as a new home|last=ThomasVo5|date=2013-03-04|website=tvoss@work|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by [[Canonical Ltd.|Canonical]] and was intended to be the display server of choice for [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]. As of 2017, it has been replaced with the Wayland display server for desktop editions of Ubuntu.

There are implementations of the Mir display server, the libmir-server and the libmir-client libraries available under the [[GPLv3]].

=== SurfaceFlinger ===
For [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (another Linux kernel-based operating system primarily for mobile devices) [[Google]] developed a display server called SurfaceFlinger:&lt;ref name="Android system architecture"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://androidteam.googlecode.com/files/Anatomy-Physiology-of-an-Android.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408053917/http://androidteam.googlecode.com/files/Anatomy-Physiology-of-an-Android.pdf |archive-date=2016-04-08 |title=Android system architecture |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Everything in Android is rendered to a "surface"; "surfaces" are produced by applications and placed into a queue that is managed by SurfaceFlinger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Surface.html |title=Android Developer: Surface}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://source.android.com/devices/graphics/arch-sf-hwc.html |title=Android Developer: SurfaceFlinger and Hardware Composer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another Android-specific solution is "Gralloc". Gralloc handles device memory i.e. it does allocation, arbitration, it handles synchronization via Android/Linux fence file descriptors (FDs). Gralloc competes with other solutions like e.g. Mesa's [[Generic Buffer Management]] (GBM) or Nvidia's EGLStreams. The gralloc hardware abstraction layer (HAL) is used to allocate the buffers that underlie "surfaces".

For compositing in Android, Surfaces are sent to SurfaceFlinger, which uses OpenGL ES to do the compositing.

Hardware Composer HAL (HWC) was introduced in Android 3.0 and has evolved steadily over the years. Its primary purpose is to determine the most efficient way to composite buffers with the available hardware. As a HAL, its implementation is device-specific and usually done by the display hardware OEM.

=== Quartz Compositor ===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Quartz2D.png|right|60px|[[Quartz 2D]] logo]] --&gt;

For Apple's [[macOS]] family of operating systems, [[Quartz Compositor]] fulfils the tasks of a display server and of a window manager in the [[windowing system]]. 

=== Desktop Window Manager ===
For [[Microsoft Windows]], from [[Windows Vista]] onward, [[Desktop Window Manager]] enables the use of hardware acceleration to render the graphical user interface. It was originally created to enable portions of the new "Windows Aero" user experience, which allowed for effects such as transparency, 3D window switching and more. It is also included with Windows Server 2008, but requires the "Desktop Experience" feature and compatible graphics drivers to be installed.

'''Earth mysteries''' are a wide range of [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[Pseudoreligion|quasi-religious]] and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] ideas focusing on cultural and religious beliefs about the [[Earth]], generally with regard to particular geographical locations of historical significance.&lt;ref name=hutton&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|first=Ronald |last=Hutton |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=1993 |pages=118–9, 123, 125, 340|isbn=0631189467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believers in Earth mysteries generally consider certain locations to be "sacred",  or  that certain spiritual "energies" may be active at those locations.&lt;ref name=ivakhiv&gt;{{cite book|title=Claiming Sacred Ground: Pilgrims and Politics at Glastonbury and Sedona |first=Adrian J. |last=Ivakhiv|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=22, 24, 32|year= 2001|isbn=0253338999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "[[alternative archaeology]]" has also been used to describe the study of Earth mystery beliefs.&lt;ref name=hutton/&gt;&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt;

The study of [[ley line]]s originates in the 1920s with [[Alfred Watkins]]. The term "Earth mysteries" for this field of interest was coined about 1970 in ''The Ley Hunter'' journal,&lt;ref&gt;earlier use of the term "earth-mysteries" mostly refers to actual [[mystery religion|mysteries]] dedicated to [[chthonic]] deities in classical antiquity.&lt;/ref&gt; and the associated concepts have been embraced and reinvented by movements such as the [[New Age Movement]] and [[neopaganism|modern paganism]] during the 1970s to 1980s.&lt;ref name=hutton/&gt;

Some New Age believers engage in travel to locations they consider important according to their beliefs; for example, [[Stonehenge]] is a popular destination among New Age seekers.&lt;ref name=hetherington&gt;{{cite book|title=New Age Travellers: Vanloads of Uproarious Humanity |first=Kevin |last=Hetherington |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |pages=143|year=2000|isbn=0304339784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macdonald &gt;{{cite book|title=Theorizing Museums: Representing Identity and Diversity in a Changing World|first=Sharon |last=Macdonald|author2=Gordon Fyfe |publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1996|isbn=0631201513|pages=156,164–6,171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of Earth mysteries can be traced back to two 17th-century [[antiquarians]]: [[John Aubrey]] and [[William Stukeley]], who both believed that [[Stonehenge]] was associated with the [[druids]]. Stukeley mixed together ancient [[monuments]] and [[mythology]] towards an "idealized vision" of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzmwsF-O3fIC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=%22John+Aubrey%22+earth+mysteries&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fxL0TcO2GI618QOhnNyPBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDwQuwUwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John+Aubrey%22+earth+mysteries&amp;f=false|title=The Cultures of Celebrations|first1=Ray Broadus|last1=Browne|first2=Michael T.|last2=Marsden|date=31 December 1994|publisher=Popular Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ley lines" were postulated by  [[Alfred Watkins]] in 1921 at a presentation at the [[Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club]], later published in ''Early British Trackways'' (1922) and ''The Old Straight Track'' (1925). Watkins formed the ''Old Straight Track Club'' in 1927, which was active until 1935 but became defunct during the World War II period.{{Citation needed|reason=Mention of organization becoming defunct, but no date or source are provided|date=February 2017}}

A revival of interest in the topic began in the 1960s, now associated with [[neopagan]] currents like [[Wicca]], and with [[ufology]]. Watkins' Straight Track Club was revived in 1962 by [[Philip Heselton]] and others as the Ley Hunters' Club. The new club's journal ''The Ley Hunter'' was issued from 1965 to 1970, subtitled "the Magazine of Earth Mysteries".{{Citation needed|reason=Reference to a journal and its content, without sources or external links|date=February 2017}}

British writer John Ivimy wrote a book in 1975 called ''The Sphinx and the Megaliths'' in which he linked the Egyptian [[Sphinx]] to the British [[Stonehenge]] and other [[megalith|megalithic structures]] claiming they were all built by a group of "elite trained" people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ex3FSCaY_4C&amp;pg=PA548&amp;dq=John+Ivimy+megaliths&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SiH1TaCLO5C38QO8q5yzBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=John+Ivimy+megaliths&amp;f=false|title=New Scientist|first=Reed Business|last=Information|date=29 August 1974|publisher=Reed Business Information|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Age boom]] of the 1980s expanded the scope of the "Earth mysteries" field beyond the British landscape, and Earth mysteries as a "New Age invented tradition" by the 1990s could include the study of ancient sites and landscapes (including [[archaeology]], [[archaeoastronomy]], and [[ley lines]]), Chinese [[geomancy]] or [[feng shui]], western magical concepts of [[gematria]], and [[dowsing]].&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.anthrosource.net/Abstract.aspx?issn=1053-4202&amp;volume=6&amp;issue=4&amp;doubleissueno=0&amp;article=237261&amp;suppno=0&amp;jstor=False| journal=Anthropology of Consciousness |volume= 6| issue = 4. |date=December 1995 |pages=31–45|title=Inventing Traditions for the New Age: A Case Study of the Earth Energy Tradition |author=JEFFERY L. MACDONALD|doi=10.1525/ac.1995.6.4.31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important writer combining these fields during the 1970s to 2000s was [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]]. Michell's book ''The View Over Atlantis'' mixed [[ley lines]] with [[folklore]] and [[archeology]]; these ideas became popularised as "earth mysteries".&lt;ref&gt;Danny Sullivan, Ley Lines: The Greatest Landscape Mystery, Publisher Green Magic, 2005, p. 11 {{ISBN|0954296346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other 1980s authors on the subject of Earth mysteries include [[Paul Devereux]] and [[Nigel Pennick]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Matthews, John Matthews, Walkers Between the Worlds: The Western Mysteries from Shaman to Magus, Publisher: Inner Traditions, 2004, p. 55 {{ISBN|9780892810918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related ideas include the "[[landscape archaeology]]" advocated by German author Kurt Derungs from about 1990, and the wider field of "[[Forteana]]", a term taken to include [[paranormal]] phenomena more generally.{{Citation needed|reason=Assertion of connection to [[Forteana]], which makes no references to either archaelogy or paranormal locations. |date=February 2017}}

==Publication history==

Books on Earth mysteries first appeared in the 1970s, discussing topics such as [[ley lines]], [[earth energy|earth energies]], [[astro-archaeology]], [[Sacred natural site|sacred landscapes]], [[megalithic monuments]], [[shamanism]], [[paganism]], [[dowsing]] and [[folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Moorey, Earth Mysteries: A Beginner's Guide, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daren Kemp, James R. Lewis, Handbook of New Age, 2007, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Proponents consider the Earth mysteries to be "[[sacred]]" and "[[Mythopoeic thought|mythopoeic]]" rather than scientific.&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt; The ley lines idea has been generally ignored by the academic establishment in the field of archaeology.&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt; The work of researchers who support the paranormal aspects of Earth mysteries have been extensively criticized by "professional debunkers" such as [[James Randi]], [[Martin Gardner]], and the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal ([[CSICOP]]).&lt;ref name=ivakhiv/&gt;

The Earth mysteries movement in Great Britain embraced the term "ritual landscapes" that was used in British archaeology starting in the 1980s, with regards to "sacred" locations apparently used for mainly ceremonial purposes in the [[Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic]] and the early [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]]; the concept has been both adopted and criticized in the field of academic archaeology.&lt;ref name= Robb&gt;{{cite journal|title=The 'ritual landscape' concept in archaeology: a heritage construction| url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a769326307~db=all |author=John G.

The '''Eduardo Mondlane University''' ({{lang-pt|Universidade Eduardo Mondlane}}; UEM) is the oldest and largest [[university]] in [[Mozambique]]. The '''UEM''' is located in [[Maputo]] and has about 40,000 students enrolled. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UEM em números - 2015|url=http://uem.mz/index.php/uem-em-numeros-2015|website=Universidade Eduardo Mondlane|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
[[File:Universidade Eduardo Mondlane.jpg|thumb|Eduardo Mondlane University]]
The institution was set up as a center for higher education in 1962 in what was then [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]], the capital of [[Portugal]]'s [[overseas province of Mozambique]]. Founded by the time of [[Ministry of the Overseas (Portugal)|Overseas Minister]] [[Adriano Moreira]], it was called ''Estudos Gerais Universitários de Moçambique'' (Mozambique General University Studies)&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; after ''[[Studium Generale]]''; in 1968 it became the '''Universidade de Lourenço Marques''' (University of Lourenço Marques).&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uem.mz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=42|website=uem.mz|title=History of Eduardo Mondlane University|accessdate=11 November 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303183546/http://www.uem.mz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=58&amp;Itemid=42|archivedate=3 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Mozambique became [[History of Mozambique#Independence|independent]] in 1975, the city was renamed "Maputo" and the university was renamed in honor of [[Frelimo]] leader [[Eduardo Mondlane]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

==Student enrolment==

In [[aerospace engineering]], especially those areas dealing with [[spacecraft]], the '''eigenvector slew''' is a method to calculate a steering correction (called a '''[[Slew (spacecraft)|slew]]''') by rotating the spacecraft around '''one''' fixed axis, or a [[Gimbal|gimbal]].  This corresponds in general to the fastest and most efficient way to reach the desired target orientation as there is only one acceleration phase and one braking phase for the angular rate. If this fixed axis is not a [[Principal axis (mechanics)|principal axis]] a time varying torque must be applied to force the spacecraft to rotate as desired, though. Also the [[Gyroscope|gyroscopic]] effect of [[momentum wheels]] must be compensated for.

That such a rotation exists corresponds precisely to a main result of the mathematical theory of [[Rotation operator (vector space)|rotation operators]], the (only real) [[eigenvector]] of the rotation operator corresponding to the desired re-orientation is this axis.  

Given the current orientation of the craft, and the desired orientation of the craft in [[cartesian coordinates]], the required [[axis of rotation]] and corresponding rotation angle to achieve the new orientation is determined by computing the eigenvector of the [[Rotation operator (vector space)|rotation operator]]. 

== Problem ==
Let

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}\ ,\ \hat{y}\ ,\  \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;

be a body fixed reference system for a [[3 axis stabilized spacecraft]].  The initial attitude
is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}=\hat{a}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{y}=\hat{b}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{z}=\hat{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

One wants to find an axis relative the spacecraft body

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}=r_x \cdot \hat{x} +r_y \cdot \hat{y} +r_z \cdot \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;

and a rotation angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that after the rotation with the angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; one has that

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}=\hat{d}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{y}=\hat{e}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{z}=\hat{f}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{d}\ ,\ \hat{e}\ ,\  \hat{f}&lt;/math&gt;

are the new target directions.

In vector form this means that

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{d}=r_a \cdot \hat{r} + \cos \alpha \cdot ( \hat{a} - r_a \cdot \hat{r})+
 \sin \alpha \cdot \hat{r} \times \hat{a}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{e}=r_b \cdot \hat{r} + \cos \alpha \cdot ( \hat{b} - r_b \cdot \hat{r})+
 \sin \alpha \cdot \hat{r} \times \hat{b}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{f}=r_c \cdot \hat{r} + \cos \alpha \cdot ( \hat{c} - r_c \cdot \hat{r})+
 \sin \alpha \cdot \hat{r} \times \hat{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Solution ==

In terms of [[linear algebra]] this means that one wants to find an [[eigenvector]] with the [[eigenvalue]] = 1 for the [[linear map]]ping defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a} \longrightarrow \hat{d}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{b} \longrightarrow \hat{e}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{c} \longrightarrow \hat{f}&lt;/math&gt;

which relative to the 

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\ ,\ \hat{b}\ ,\ \hat{c}&lt;/math&gt;

coordinate system has the matrix

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
\langle \hat{d}| \hat{a}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{e}| \hat{a}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{f}| \hat{a} \rangle \\
\langle\hat{d}| \hat{b}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{e}| \hat{b}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{f}| \hat{b}\rangle \\
\langle\hat{d}| \hat{c}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{e}| \hat{c}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{f}| \hat{c}\rangle
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Because this is the matrix of the [[Rotation operator (vector space)|rotation operator]] relative the base vector system &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\ ,\ \hat{b}\ ,\ \hat{c}&lt;/math&gt; the eigenvalue can be determined with the algorithm described in "[[Rotation operator (vector space)]]".

With the notations used here this is:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \alpha=\frac{\langle\hat{d}| \hat{a}\rangle+\langle\hat{e}| \hat{b}\rangle+\langle\hat{f}| \hat{c}\rangle-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_a=\langle\hat{f}| \hat{b}\rangle-\langle\hat{e}| \hat{c}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_b=\langle\hat{d}| \hat{c}\rangle-\langle\hat{f}| \hat{a}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_c=\langle\hat{e}| \hat{a}\rangle-\langle\hat{d}| \hat{b}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\bar{r}|=\sqrt{{r_a}^2+{r_b}^2+{r_c}^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \alpha=\frac{|\bar{r}|}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The rotation angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\operatorname{arg}(\cos \alpha,\sin \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

where "&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{arg}(x\ ,\ y)&lt;/math&gt;" is the polar argument of the vector &lt;math&gt;(\ x\ ,\ y\ )&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the function [[Atan2|ATAN2(y,x)]] (or in [[double precision]] DATAN2(y,x)) available in for example the programming language [[Fortran|FORTRAN]].

The resulting &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; will be in the interval &lt;math&gt;0 \le \alpha \le \pi&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \pi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|\bar{r}| &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and the uniquely defined rotation (unit) vector is:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}=\frac{\bar{r}}{|\bar{r}|}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that
 
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\hat{d}| \hat{a}\rangle +\langle\hat{e}| \hat{b}\rangle+\langle\hat{f}| \hat{c}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the matrix defined by the orthogonal linear mapping and that the components of the "[[eigenvector]]" are fixed and constant during the rotation, i.e.
 
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{r}=r_x \cdot \hat{x}(t) +r_y \cdot \hat{y}(t) +r_z \cdot \hat{z}(t)=
r_x \cdot \hat{a} +r_y \cdot \hat{b} +r_z \cdot \hat{c}=
r_x \cdot \hat{d} +r_y \cdot \hat{e} +r_z \cdot \hat{f}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}\ ,\ \hat{y}\ ,\ \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt; are moving with time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; during the slew.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1001">'''Elegant degradation''' is a term used in engineering to describe what occurs to machines which are subject to constant, repetitive stress.

Externally, such a machine maintains the same appearance to the user, appearing to function properly. Internally, the machine slowly weakens over time. Eventually, unable to withstand the stress, it breaks down. Compared to [[Fault-tolerant system|graceful degradation]], the operational quality does not decrease at all, but the breakdown may be just as sudden.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assetinsights.net/Glossary/G_Elegant_Degradation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

This term's meaning varies depending on context and field, and may not be strictly considered exclusive to engineering.

'''Environmental economics''' is a sub-field of [[economics]] that is concerned with environmental issues. It has become a widely studied topic due to growing concerns in regards to the environment in the twentyfirst century. Quoting from the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] Environmental Economics program:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... Environmental Economics ... undertakes theoretical or empirical studies of the economic effects of national or local environmental policies around the world ... . Particular issues include the costs and benefits of alternative environmental policies to deal with air pollution, water quality, toxic substances, solid waste, and global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Environmental economics is distinguished from [[ecological economics]] in that ecological economics emphasizes the economy as a subsystem of the ecosystem with its focus upon preserving [[natural capital]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Environmental_and_ecological_economics Lead Author: Robert Nadeau Article Topics: Ecological economics and Environmental economics Last Updated: August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh (2001).

==Topics and concepts==
{{Economics sidebar}}

===Market failure===
Central to environmental economics is the concept of [[market failure]].  Market failure means that markets fail to allocate resources efficiently. As stated by Hanley, Shogren, and White (2007) in their textbook ''Environmental Economics'':&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, N., J. Shogren, and B. White (2007). Environmental Economics in Theory and Practice, Palgrave, London.&lt;/ref&gt; "A market failure occurs when the market does not allocate scarce resources to generate the greatest social welfare. A wedge exists between what a private person does given market prices and what society might want him or her to do to protect the environment.  Such a wedge implies wastefulness or economic inefficiency; resources can be reallocated to make at least one person better off without making anyone else worse off." Common forms of market failure include externalities, non-excludability and [[Rivalry (economics)|non-rivalry]].

===Externality===
An [[externality]] exists when a person makes a choice that affects other people in a way that is not accounted for in the market price. An externality can be positive or negative, but is usually associated with negative externalities in environmental economics. For instance, water seepage in residential buildings happen in upper floor affect the lower floor.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Yi Man Li (2012), The Internalisation Of Environmental Externalities Affecting Dwellings: A Review Of Court Cases In Hong Kong, Economic Affairs, Volume 32, Issue 2, pages 81–87&lt;/ref&gt; Another example concerns how the sale of Amazon timber disregards the amount of carbon dioxide released in the cutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Environmental degradation replaces classic imperialism|last=Chapman|first=Same|date=May 3, 2012|work=The Whitman College Pioneer: Whitman College|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2018}} Or a firm emitting [[pollution]] will typically not take into account the costs that its pollution imposes on others.  As a result, pollution may occur in excess of the 'socially efficient' level, which is the level that would exist if the market was required to account for the pollution. A classic definition influenced by [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[James Meade]] is provided by Heller and Starrett (1976), who define an externality as "a situation in which the private economy lacks sufficient incentives to create a potential market in some good and the nonexistence of this market results in losses of [[Pareto efficiency]]".&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Walter P. and David A. Starrett (1976), On the Nature of Externalities, in: Lin, Stephen A.Y. (ed.), Theory and Measurement of Economic Externalities, Academic Press, New York, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  In economic terminology, externalities are examples of [[market failure]]s, in which the unfettered market does not lead to an efficient outcome.

===Common goods and public goods===
When it is too costly to exclude some people from access to an environmental resource, the resource is either called a [[common-pool resource|common property resource]] (when there is rivalry for the resource, such that one person's use of the resource reduces others' opportunity to use the resource) or a [[public good]] (when use of the resource is [[rivalry (economics)|non-rivalrous]]). In either case of non-exclusion, market allocation is likely to be inefficient.

These challenges have long been recognized. [[Garrett Hardin|Hardin]]'s (1968) concept of the [[tragedy of the commons]] popularized the challenges involved in non-exclusion and common property. "Commons" refers to the environmental asset itself, "common property resource" or "common pool resource" refers to a property right regime that allows for some collective body to devise schemes to exclude others, thereby allowing the capture of future benefit streams; and "open-access" implies no ownership in the sense that property everyone owns nobody owns.&lt;ref name="Ostrom, E 1990"&gt;Ostrom, E. 1990. Governing the Commons. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic problem is that if people ignore the scarcity value of the commons, they can end up expending too much effort, [[over harvesting]] a resource (e.g., a fishery). Hardin theorizes that in the absence of restrictions, users of an open-access resource will use it more than if they had to pay for it and had exclusive rights, leading to [[environmental degradation]].  See, however, [[Elinor Ostrom|Ostrom]]'s (1990) work on how people using real common property resources have worked to establish self-governing rules to reduce the risk of the tragedy of the commons.&lt;ref name="Ostrom, E 1990"/&gt;

The [[mitigation of climate change]] effects is an example of a public good, where the social benefits are not reflected completely in the market price. This is a public good since the risks of climate change are both non-rival and non-excludable.  Such efforts are non-rival since climate mitigation provided to one does not reduce the level of mitigation that anyone else enjoys.  They are non-excludable actions as they will have global consequences from which no one can be excluded. A country's incentive to invest in carbon abatement is reduced because it can "[[Free rider problem|free ride]]" off the efforts of other countries. Over a century ago, Swedish economist [[Knut Wicksell]] (1896) first discussed how public goods can be under-provided by the market because people might conceal their preferences for the good, but still enjoy the benefits without paying for them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Valuation ===
Assessing the economic value of the environment is a major topic within the field. Use and indirect use are tangible benefits accruing from [[natural resource]]s or [[ecosystem services]] (see the [[Ecological economics#Nature|nature section]] of ecological economics). Non-use values include existence, option, and bequest values. For example, some people may value the existence of a diverse set of species, regardless of the effect of the loss of a species on ecosystem services. The existence of these species may have an option value, as there may be the possibility of using it for some human purpose. For example, certain plants may be researched for drugs. Individuals may value the ability to leave a pristine environment to their children.

Use and indirect use values can often be inferred from revealed behavior, such as the cost of taking [[travel cost analysis|recreational trips]] or using [[hedonic model|hedonic methods]] in which values are estimated based on observed prices.  Non-use values are usually estimated using stated preference methods such as [[contingent valuation]] or [[choice modelling]]. Contingent valuation typically takes the form of surveys in which people are asked how much they would pay to observe and recreate in the environment ([[willingness to pay]]) or their willingness to accept (WTA) compensation for the destruction of the environmental good. [[Hedonic pricing]] examines the effect the environment has on economic decisions through housing prices, traveling expenses, and payments to visit parks.&lt;ref&gt;Harris J. (2006). ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
Solutions advocated to correct such externalities include:

* '' [[United States Environmental Protection Agency#Related legislation|Environmental regulations]]''. Under this plan, the economic impact has to be estimated by the regulator. Usually this is done using [[cost-benefit analysis]].  There is a growing realization that regulations (also known as "command and control" instruments) are not so distinct from economic instruments as is commonly asserted by proponents of environmental economics.  E.g.1 regulations are enforced by fines, which operate as a form of tax if pollution rises above the threshold prescribed.  E.g.2 pollution must be monitored and laws enforced, whether under a pollution tax regime or a regulatory regime.  The main difference an environmental economist would argue exists between the two methods, however, is the total cost of the regulation.  "Command and control" regulation often applies uniform emissions limits on polluters, even though each firm has different costs for emissions reductions.  Some firms, in this system, can abate inexpensively, while others can only abate at high cost.  Because of this, the total abatement has some expensive and some inexpensive efforts to abate.  Consequently, modern "Command and control" regulations are oftentimes designed in a way, which addresses these issues by incorporating utility parameters. For instance, CO2 emission standards for specific manufacturers in the automotive industry are either linked to the average vehicle footprint (US system) or average vehicle weight (EU system) of their entire vehicle fleet. Environmental economic regulations find the cheapest emission abatement efforts first, then the more expensive methods second.  E.g. as said earlier, trading, in the quota system, means a firm only abates if doing so would cost less than paying someone else to make the same reduction.  This leads to a lower cost for the total abatement effort as a whole.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* ''[[quota on pollution|Quotas on pollution]]''. Often it is advocated that pollution reductions should be achieved by way of [[tradeable emissions permits]], which if freely traded may ensure that reductions in pollution are achieved at least cost. In theory, if such tradeable quotas are allowed, then a firm would reduce its own pollution load only if doing so would cost less than paying someone else to make the same reduction.  In practice, tradeable permits approaches have had some success, such as the U.S.'s sulphur dioxide trading program or the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and interest in its application is spreading to other environmental problems.
* ''[[Tax, tariff and trade|Taxes and tariffs on pollution]]''. Increasing the costs of polluting will discourage polluting, and will provide a "dynamic incentive," that is, the disincentive continues to operate even as pollution levels fall.  A pollution tax that reduces pollution to the socially "optimal" level would be set at such a level that pollution occurs only if the benefits to society (for example, in form of greater production) exceeds the costs. Some advocate a major shift from taxation from income and sales taxes to tax on pollution - the so-called "[[green tax shift]]."
* ''Better defined [[property rights]]''. The [[Coase Theorem]] states that assigning property rights will lead to an optimal solution, regardless of who receives them, if [[transaction costs]] are trivial and the number of parties negotiating is limited. For example, if people living near a factory had a right to clean air and water, or the factory had the right to pollute, then either the factory could pay those affected by the pollution or the people could pay the factory not to pollute. Or, citizens could take action themselves as they would if other property rights were violated. The US River Keepers Law of the 1880s was an early example, giving citizens downstream the right to end pollution upstream themselves if government itself did not act (an early example of [[bioregional democracy]]).  Many markets for "pollution rights" have been created in the late twentieth century—see [[emissions trading]]. According to the Coase Theorem, the involved parties will bargain with each other, which results in an efficient solution. However, modern economic theory has shown that the presence of asymmetric information may lead to inefficient bargaining outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myerson|first=Roger B|last2=Satterthwaite|first2=Mark A|date=1983|title=Efficient mechanisms for bilateral trading|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0531(83)90048-0|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=29|issue=2|pages=265–281|doi=10.1016/0022-0531(83)90048-0|issn=0022-0531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Rob (1989) has shown that pollution claim settlements will not lead to the socially optimal outcome when the individuals that will be affected by pollution have learned private information about their disutility already before the negotiations take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rob|first=Rafael|date=1989|title=Pollution claim settlements under private information|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0531(89)90022-7|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=47|issue=2|pages=307–333|doi=10.1016/0022-0531(89)90022-7|issn=0022-0531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldlücke and Schmitz (2018) have shown that inefficiencies may also result if the parties learn their private information only after the negotiations, provided that the feasible transfer payments are bounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldlücke|first=Susanne|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2018|title=Pollution claim settlements reconsidered: Hidden information and bounded payments|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.08.005|journal=European Economic Review|volume=110|pages=211–222|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.08.005|issn=0014-2921|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to other fields ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Environmental economics is related to [[ecological economics]] but there are differences. Most environmental economists have been trained as economists. They apply the tools of economics to address environmental problems, many of which are related to so-called market failures—circumstances wherein the "[[invisible hand]]" of economics is unreliable.  Most ecological economists have been trained as ecologists, but have expanded the scope of their work to consider the impacts of humans and their economic activity on ecological systems and services, and vice versa. This field takes as its premise that economics is a strict subfield of [[ecology]].  Ecological economics is sometimes described as taking a more pluralistic approach to [[natural environment|environmental]] problems and focuses more explicitly on long-term environmental sustainability and issues of scale.

Environmental economics is viewed as more pragmatic in a [[price system]]; ecological economics as more idealistic in its attempts not to use [[money]] as a primary arbiter of decisions. These two groups of specialists sometimes have conflicting views which may be traced to the different philosophical underpinnings.

Another context in which [[Externality|externalities]] apply is when [[globalization]] permits one player in a market who is unconcerned with [[biodiversity]] to undercut prices of another who is - creating a [[race to the bottom]] in regulations and conservation. This, in turn, may cause loss of [[natural capital]] with consequent erosion, water purity problems, diseases, desertification, and other outcomes which are not [[Pareto efficiency|efficient]] in an economic sense. This concern is related to the subfield of [[sustainable development]] and its political relation, the [[anti-globalization movement]].

Environmental economics was once distinct from [[resource economics]]. Natural resource economics as a subfield began when the main concern of researchers was the optimal commercial exploitation of natural resource stocks. But resource managers and policy-makers eventually began to pay attention to the broader importance of natural resources (e.g. values of fish and trees beyond just their commercial exploitation). It is now difficult to distinguish "environmental" and "natural resource" economics as separate fields as the two became associated with [[sustainability]].  Many of the more radical [[green economists]] split off to work on an alternate [[political economy]].

Environmental economics was a major influence on the theories of [[natural capitalism]] and [[environmental finance]], which could be said to be two sub-branches of environmental economics concerned with resource conservation in production, and the [[value of biodiversity]] to humans, respectively.  The theory of [[natural capitalism]] (Hawken, Lovins, Lovins) goes further than traditional environmental economics by envisioning a world where natural services are considered on par with [[Capital (economics)|physical capital]].

The more radical [[Green economists]] reject neoclassical economics in favour of a new [[political economy]] beyond [[capitalism]] or [[communism]] that gives a greater emphasis to the interaction of the human economy and the natural environment, acknowledging that "economy is three-fifths of ecology" - Mike Nickerson.

These more radical approaches would imply changes to [[money supply]] and likely also a [[bioregional democracy]] so that political, economic, and ecological "environmental limits" were all aligned, and not subject to the [[arbitrage]] normally possible under [[capitalism]].

An emerging sub-field of environmental economics studies its intersection with [[development economics]]. Dubbed "envirodevonomics" by [[Michael Greenstone]] and B. Kelsey Jack in their paper "Envirodevonomics: A Research Agenda for a Young Field," the sub-field is primarily interested in studying "why environmental quality [is] so poor in developing countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenstone |first1=Michael |last2=Jack |first2=B. Kelsey |title=Envirodevonomics: A Research Agenda for an Emerging Field |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=5–42 |doi=10.1257/jel.53.1.5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strategy for better understanding this correlation between a country's GDP and its environmental quality involves analyzing how many of the central concepts of environmental economics, including market failures, externalities, and willingness to pay, may be complicated by the particular problems facing developing countries, such as political issues, lack of infrastructure, or inadequate financing tools, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inclusive green growth the pathway to sustainable development.|date=May 2012|publisher=World Bank|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-9552-3|pages=12–13|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSDNET/Resources/Inclusive_Green_Growth_May_2012.pdf|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63481">An '''extrajudicial killing''' (also known as '''extrajudicial execution''') is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any [[Judiciary|judicial proceeding]] or legal process. [[Extrajudicial punishment]]s are mostly seen by humanity to be unethical, since they bypass the [[due process]] of the legal jurisdiction in which they occur.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Extrajudicial killings often target leading political, trade union, dissident, religious, and social figures and are only those carried out by the [[State (polity)|state]] government or other state authorities like the armed forces or police, as extra-legal fulfillment of their prescribed role.

Section 3(a) of the [[United States]] [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] contains a definition of extrajudicial killing:

{{quote|a deliberate killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regular constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. Such term, however, does not include any such killing that, under international law, is lawfully carried out under the authority of a foreign nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Congressional Record, V. 147, Pt. 6, May 9, 2001 to May 21 2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCYK7X_SqHIC&amp;pg=PA7897|date=October 2005|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|page=7897|id=GGKEY:2126SDPKSFJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The legal exclusion in the sentence that starts "Such term, however ..." covers the killing of [[enemy combatant]]s and others who are not protected under international law from extrajudicial killing.}} }}

== Argentina ==
[[Argentina]]'s dictatorial government during the 1976–1983 period used extrajudicial killings systematically as way of crushing the opposition in the so-called "[[Dirty War]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-131783-2009-09-15.html Veinticinco años del informe de la Conadep] {{sp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or what is known in Spanish as ''La Guerra Sucia''.

[[File:Zniknąć 03 - Czarownik ciągnie za uszy.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in [[Warsaw]], reminding about the disappearances of oppositionals in Belarus]]
In 1999 [[Belarus]]ian opposition leaders [[Yury Zacharanka]] and [[Viktar Hanchar]] together with his business associate [[Anatol Krasouski]] disappeared. Hanchar and Krasouski disappeared the same day of a broadcast on state television in which President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] ordered the chiefs of his security services to crack down on “opposition scum”. Although the [[State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus]] (KGB) had them under constant surveillance, the official investigation announced that the case could not be solved. The disappearance of journalist [[Dzmitry Zavadski]] in 2000 has also yielded no results. Copies of a report by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which linked senior Belarusian officials to the cases of disappearances, were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=16 Years of Silence: Enforced Disappearances in Belarus Must Be Investigated |url=http://blog.amnestyusa.org/europe/16-years-of-silence-enforced-disappearances-in-belarus-must-be-investigated/  | newspaper=[[Amnesty International]]|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] claims that Zacharanka, Hanchar, Krasouski and Zavadski likely became victims of extrajudicial executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Report: Belarus:

These included Manuel Contreras, the former head of Chile's [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|National Intelligence Directorate]] (DINA), which served as Pinochet's [[Secret police|secret police.]] He was behind numerous assassinations and human rights abuses such as the 1974 abduction and [[forced disappearance]] of Socialist Party leader [[Victor Olea Alegria]]. Some of the killings were also coordinated with other right-wing dictatorships in the Southern Cone in the so-called [[Operation Condor]]. There were reports of United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) involvement, particularly within its activities in Central and South America that promoted anti-Communist coups.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Ops: The Rise of Special Forces in the CIA, the SAS, and Mossad|last=Geraghty|first=Tony|publisher=Pegasus Books|year=2012|isbn=9781605987613|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While CIA's complicity was not proven, American dollars supported the regimes that carried out extrajudicial killings such as the Pinochet administration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; CIA, for instance, helped create DINA and the agency admitted that Contreras was one of its assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Predatory States: Operation Condor and Covert War in Latin America|last=McSherry|first=Patrice|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|year=2005|isbn=9780742536876|location=Lanham, MD|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== El Salvador ==
During the [[El Salvador Civil War|Salvadoran civil war]], death squads achieved notoriety when far-right vigilantes assassinated Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] for his social activism in March 1980. In December 1980, [[1980 murders of U.S. missionaries in El Salvador|four Americans—three nuns and a lay worker—were raped and murdered]] by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing hundreds of peasants and activists, including such notable priests as [[Rutilio Grande]]. Because the death squads involved were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military, which was receiving U.S. funding and training from American advisors during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, these events prompted outrage in the U.S. and led to a temporary cutoff in military aid from the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} although death squad activity stretched well into the Reagan years (1981–1989) as well.

== Honduras ==
Honduras also had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was [[Battalion 316]].  Hundreds of people, including teachers, politicians and union bosses, were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial support and training from the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-negroponte1a-story.html|title=When a wave of torture and murder staggered a small U.S. ally, truth was a casualty.|first=Gary Cohn and Ginger|last=Thompson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iran ==
{{See also|Chain Murders of Iran}}

In 1953 a regime was installed through the efforts of the American [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the British [[MI6]] in which the Shah (hereditary monarch) [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] used [[SAVAK]] death squads (also trained by the CIA) to imprison, torture and/or kill hundreds of dissidents.  After the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]] death squads were used to an even greater extent by the new Islamic government. In 1983, the CIA gave the Supreme Leader of Iran—[[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]]—information on [[KGB]] agents in Iran. This information was probably used. The Iranian government later used death squads occasionally throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s; however by the 2000s it seems to have almost entirely, if not completely, ceased using them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/the-chain-murders-1988-1998.html|title=The Chain Murders|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=October 29, 2018|website=Tehran Bureau|publisher=PBS|last=Sahim|first=Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iraq ==
[[Iraq]] was formed by the partition and domination of various tribal lands by the British in the early 20th century. Britain granted independence to Iraq in 1932, on the urging of [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]], though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces. [[King Ghazi]] of Iraq ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal's death in 1933, while undermined by attempted military coups, until his death in 1939. The United Kingdom invaded Iraq in 1941 (see [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), for fear that the government of [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] might cut oil supplies to Western nations, and because of his links to the [[Axis powers]]. A military occupation followed the restoration of the Hashemite monarchy, and the occupation ended on October 26, 1947. Iraq was left with a national government led from [[Baghdad]] made up of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ethnicity in key positions of power, ruling over an ad-hoc nation splintered by tribal affiliations. This leadership used death squads and committed massacres in Iraq throughout the 20th century, culminating in the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/9/13/14133/1410/|title=History of Iraq: 1933 - 1939|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has since become increasingly partitioned following the [[Iraq War]] into three zones: a [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish ethnic zone]] to the north, a Sunni center and the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] ethnic zone to the south. The [[Secularism|secular]] [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]] [[Ba'ath Party|Baathist]] leadership were replaced with a provisional and later constitutional government that included leadership roles for the Shia (Prime Minister) and Kurdish (President of the Republic) peoples of the nation. This paralleled the development of ethnic militias by the Shia, Sunni, and the Kurdish ([[Peshmerga]]).

There were [[death squad]]s formed by members of every ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=U.S. cracks down on Iraq death squads |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/24/iraq.main/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=2006-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the national capital of Baghdad some members of the now-Shia police department and army (and militia members posing as members of police or armed forces) formed unofficial, unsanctioned, but long-tolerated death squads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,1869439,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=US patrols to weed out militias posing as Iraqi police |first=Peter |last=Beaumont |date=September 11, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They possibly had links to the Interior Ministry and were popularly known as the 'black crows'.

The victims of these attacks were predominantly young males who had probably been suspected of being members of the Sunni [[insurgency]]. Agitators such as Abdul Razaq al-Na'as, Dr. Abdullateef al-Mayah, and Dr. Wissam Al-Hashimi have also been killed. These killings are not limited to men; women and children have also been arrested and/or killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title='25,000 civilians' killed in Iraq |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4692589.stm |publisher=BBC |date=2005-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these killings have also been part of simple robberies or other criminal activities.

A feature in a May 2005 issue of the magazine of the ''New York Times'' claimed that the U.S. military had modelled the "Wolf Brigade", the Iraqi interior ministry police commandos, on the death squads used in the 1980s to crush the left-wing insurgency in [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref name=Nytimes050501&gt;{{cite news |title=The Way of the Commandos |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01ARMY.html?ei=5088&amp;en=f0604488a64924cd&amp;ex=1272686400&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position= |publisher=The New York Times |date=2005-05-01 |first=Peter |last=Maass |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western news organizations such as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] and [[People (magazine)|''People'']] disassembled this by focusing on aspects such as probable [[militia]] membership, religious ethnicity, as well as uniforms worn by these squads rather than stating the [[United States]]-backed Iraqi government had death squads active in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4719252.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Iraq 'death squad caught in act' |date=February 16, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soviet Union and Russia ==
In [[Bolshevist Russia|Soviet Russia]] since 1918 [[Cheka]] was authorized to execute "counterevolutionaries" without trial. Hostages were also executed by Cheka during the [[Red Terror]] in 1918–1920.

The [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|successors of Cheka]] also had the authority for extrajudicial executions. In 1937–38 hundreds of thousands where executed extrajudicially during the [[Great Purge]] under the lists approved by [[NKVD troika]]s. In some cases the Soviet special services did not arrest and then execute their victims but just secretly killed them without any arrest. For example, [[Solomon Mikhoels]] was murdered in 1948 and his body was run over to create the impression of a traffic accident. The Soviet special services also conducted extrajudicial killings abroad, most notably of [[Leon Trotskiy]] in 1940 in [[Mexico]], [[Stepan Bandera]] in 1959 in Germany, [[Georgi Markov]] in 1978 in London.

In the [[Russian Federation]], a number of journalist murders were attributed to public administration figures, usually where the publications would reveal their involvement in large corruption scandals.

It has been regarded that the [[Alexander Litvinenko assassination theories|Alexander Litvinenko]] murder was linked to Russian special forces.

USA and UK intelligence agents reportedly claim that Russian assassins, some possibly at orders of the government, are behind at least fourteen [[targeted killing]]s on British soil that police called non-suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-police-evidence-russian-assassins-behind-14-suspicious-deaths-british-soil-boris-berezovsky-scot-a7793151.html|title=UK authorities 'overlooked' evidence linking Russia to deaths on British soil|date=16 June 2017|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legality of killings such as in the [[death of Osama bin Laden]] in 2011 have been brought into question. In that case, the US defended itself claiming the killing was not an assassination but an act of "National Self Defense".&lt;ref name=OBLQ&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Aiden|title=Osama Bin Laden: Legality of Killing questioned|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13318372|accessdate=June 16, 2017|agency=BBC News|publisher=BBC News|date=May 12, 2011|ref=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13318372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berijam tiger sign.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Tiger]] as flagship species for a campaign in India]]
In [[conservation biology]], a '''flagship species''' is a species chosen to raise support for biodiversity conservation in a given place or social context. Definitions have varied, but they have tended to focus on the strategic goals and the [[socio-economic]] nature of the concept, to support the [[marketing]] of a conservation effort. The species need to be popular, to work as symbols or icons, and to stimulate people to provide money or support.

Species selected since the idea was developed in 1980s include widely recognised and charismatic species like the [[black rhinoceros]], the [[Bengal tiger]], and the [[Asian elephant]]. More locally significant species like the [[Chesapeake blue crab]] and the [[Pemba flying fox]] have suited a cultural and social context.

Utilizing a flagship species has limitations. It can skew management and conservation priorities, which may  conflict. Stakeholders may be negatively affected if the flagship species is lost. The use of a flagship may have limited effect, and the approach may not protect the species from extinction: all of the top ten charismatic groups of animal including tigers, lions, elephants and giraffes are [[endangered]].

== Definitions ==

[[File:JCBCP logo.png|thumb|upright|[[Zanzibar red colobus]] as flagship species for a conservation organization in [[Zanzibar]]]]

The term flagship is linked to the [[metaphor]] of representation. In its popular usage, flagships are viewed as ambassadors or icons for a conservation project or movement. The geographer Maan Barua noted that metaphors influence what people understand and how they act; that mammals are disproportionately chosen; and that biologists need to come to grips with language to improve the public's knowledge of conservation.&lt;ref name="Barua Metaphor"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barua | first=Maan | title=Mobilizing metaphors: the popular use of keystone, flagship and umbrella species concepts | journal=Biodiversity and Conservation| volume=20 | issue=7 | year=2011 | doi=10.1007/s10531-011-0035-y | pages=1427–1440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several definitions have been advanced for the flagship species concept and for some time there has been confusion even in the academic literature.&lt;ref name="Veríssimo Framework"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Verissimo | first=Diogo | last2=MacMillan | first2=Douglas C. | last3=Smith | first3=Robert J. | title=Toward a systematic approach for identifying conservation flagships | journal=Conservation Letters | volume=4 | issue=1 | date=2010-11-29 | doi=10.1111/j.1755-263x.2010.00151.x | pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the latest definitions focus on the strategic, socio-economic, and marketing character of the concept.&lt;ref name="Veríssimo Framework" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ducarme2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ducarme |first=Frédéric |last2=Luque |first2=Gloria M. |last3=Courchamp |first3=Franck |title=What are "charismatic species" for conservation biologists ? |url=http://biologie.ens-lyon.fr/ressources/bibliographies/m1-11-12-biosci-reviews-ducarme-f-1c-m.xml |journal=BioSciences Master Reviews |year=2012 |accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The flagship species concept appears to have become popular around the mid 1980s&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, J. 2005. Marine turtles: the role of flagship species in interactions between people and the Sea MAST, 3(2) and 4(1),5–38&lt;/ref&gt; within the debate on how to prioritise species for conservation. The first widely available references to use the flagship concept applied it to both neotropical primates&lt;ref&gt;Mittermeier, R. 1988. Primate diversity and the tropical forest. Pages 145-154 in [[E. O. Wilson]], editor. Biodiversity. National Academy Press.

== Choosing species ==
Chosen flagship species include the [[Bengal tiger]] (''Panthera tigris''), the [[giant panda]] (''Ailuropoda melanoleuca''), the [[Golden lion tamarin]] (''Leontopithecus rosalia''), the [[African elephant]] (''Loxodonta sp.'') and [[Asian elephant]] (''Elephas maximus'').&lt;ref name="Veríssimo Framework"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barua Mutiny"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barua | first=Maan | last2=Tamuly | first2=Jatin | last3=Ahmed | first3=Riyaz Akhtar | title=Mutiny or Clear Sailing?

Some flagship species are [[keystone species]], like the African lion, a [[apex predator|top predator]]: it used to control the populations of large herbivores, protecting ecosystems across the entire landscape. However, the lion's ability to serve as a keystone species is decreasing as its population and range decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The African lion: what faster decline of apex predator means for ecosystems |url=http://theconversation.com/the-african-lion-what-faster-decline-of-apex-predator-means-for-ecosystems-49688 |publisher=The Conversation |accessdate=18 April 2018 |date=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HaleKoprowski2018"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hale | first=Sarah L. | last2=Koprowski | first2=John L. | title=Ecosystem-level effects of keystone species reintroduction: a literature review | journal=Restoration Ecology | volume=26 | issue=3 | pages=439–445 | date=February 2018 | doi=10.1111/rec.12684}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] uses flagship species as one of its species classification categories, along with keystone and [[indicator species]]. It chooses between these when selecting a priority species to represent the conservation threats facing a certain region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Species Programe: how WWF classifies species {{!}} Know your flagship, keystone, priority and indicator species |url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/species/flagship_keystone_indicator_definition/|publisher=[[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] |accessdate=18 April 2018|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flagship species can represent an environmental feature (e.g. a species or ecosystem), cause (e.g. climate change or ocean acidification), organization (e.g. NGO or government department) or geographic region (e.g. state or protected area).&lt;ref name="Veríssimo Framework" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Veríssimo | first=Diogo | last2=MacMillan | first2=Douglas C. | last3=Smith | first3=Robert J. | title=Marketing diversity: a response to Joseph and colleagues | journal=Conservation Letters | volume=4 | issue=4 | date=2011-04-01 | doi=10.1111/j.1755-263x.2011.00175.x | pages=326–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barua Ambio"/&gt;

Flagship species can be selected according to many different methodologies, such as [[social marketing]], [[environmental economics]], and [[conservation biology]], depending on what is [[value (economics)|valued]] by the audience they try to target,&lt;ref name="Veríssimo Framework"/&gt; and the goals of the project, such as conservation awareness, fundraising, [[ecotourism]] promotion, community-based conservation, and promotion of funded research.&lt;ref name="Barua Ambio"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Barua | first=Maan | last2=Root-Bernstein | first2=Meredith | last3=Ladle | first3=Richard J. | last4=Jepson | first4=Paul | title=Defining Flagship Uses is Critical for Flagship Selection: A Critique of the IUCN Climate Change Flagship Fleet | journal=AMBIO | volume=40 | issue=4 | date=2011-01-04 | doi=10.1007/s13280-010-0116-2 | pmid=21809786 | pages=431–435| pmc=3357738 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is illustrated by the differences in recommendations made for flagship species selection targeting different target audiences such as local communities&lt;ref name="Bowen-Jones 2002" /&gt; and tourists.&lt;ref name="Veríssimo Seychelles"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Veríssimo | first=D. | last2=Fraser | first2=I. | last3=Groombridge | first3=J. | last4=Bristol | first4=R. | last5=MacMillan | first5=D.

== Limitations ==

The use of flagship species has some limitations:&lt;ref name="Courchamp2018"/&gt;

Leaving aside the impact on other species, charisma does not seem to protect even charismatic species against extinction. All ten of the most charismatic groups{{efn|Elephant includes African savannah, African forest, and Asian species; giraffe has been split into four species.}} of animal identified in a 2018 study, namely tiger, lion, elephant, giraffe, leopard, panda, cheetah, polar bear, wolf, and gorilla, are currently [[endangered]]; only the giant panda shows a demographic growth from an extremely small population. The researchers suggest that the widespread use of images of these animals has given the public the impression that the animals are abundant, obscuring their high risk of imminent extinction. They note that this remains true despite the intense focus of conservation efforts on these particular species.&lt;ref name="Courchamp2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Courchamp |first1=F. |last2=Jaric |first2=I. |last3=Albert |first3=C. |last4=Meinard |first4=Y. |last5=Ripple |first5=W.

Conservation flagships can be used at broader levels, for example as ecosystems like coral reefs, rainforests or protected areas like the Serengeti or Yellowstone. Some recent initiatives have developed flagships based on the conservation value of particular areas or species. Examples of these are the EDGE project run by the [[Zoological Society of London]] and the Hotspots run by [[Conservation International]].&lt;ref name="Veríssimo Framework"/&gt;
More recently, work in microbiology has started to use flagship species in a distinct way. This work relates to the biogeography of micro-organisms and uses particular species because "eyecatching "flagships" with conspicuous size and/or morphology are the best distribution indicators".&lt;ref name="Foissner 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Foissner |first1=Wilhelm |title=Two new "flagship" ciliates (Protozoa, Ciliophora) from Venezuela: Sleighophrys pustulata and Luporinophrys micelae |journal=European Journal of Protistology |date=April 2005 |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=99–117 |doi=10.1016/j.ejop.2004.10.002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0932473904001026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foissner 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Foissner, W. |author2=Stoeck, T. |year=2006 |title=''Rigidothrix goiseri'' nov gen., nov spec.

'''Frequency-dependent foraging''' is defined as the tendency of an individual to selectively forage on a certain species or  [[polymorphism (biology)|morph]] based on its relative frequency within a population.&lt;ref name="levin"&gt;Levin 1972. Low frequency disadvantage in the exploitation of pollinators by corolla variants in Phlox. Am. Nat., 106: 453-460.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically for [[pollinators]], this refers to the tendency to visit a particular floral morph or plant species based on its frequency within the local plant community, even if [[nectar]] rewards are equivalent amongst different morphs. Pollinators that forage in a frequency-dependent manner will exhibit [[flower constancy]]&lt;ref&gt;Chittka, L, JD Thomson and NM Waser. 1999. Flower constancy, insect psychology, and plant evolution. Naturwissenschaften, 86: 361-377.&lt;/ref&gt; for a certain morph, but the preferred floral type will be dependent on its frequency. Additionally, frequency-dependent foraging differs from density-dependent foraging as the latter considers the absolute number of certain morphs per unit area as a factor influencing pollinator choice.&lt;ref&gt;Bosch, M and NM Waser. 1999. Effects of local density on pollination and reproduction in Delphinium nuttallianum and Aconitum columbianum (Ranunculaceae). Am. J. Bot. 86: 871-879.&lt;/ref&gt; Although density of a morph will be related to its frequency, common morphs are still preferred when overall plant densities are high.&lt;ref name="S97a"&gt;Smithson, A and MR Macnair. 1997a. Density-dependent and frequency-dependent selection by bumblebees Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Biol J Linn Soc., 60: 401-417.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Bumblebee 05.JPG|thumb|200px|Bumblebee (probably ''Bombus terrestris'') with collected pollen visible on hindleg.]]
Floral traits, such as [[corolla (flower)|corolla]] color, flower shape, size and scent, appear to have evolved primarily for the purpose of attracting pollinators&lt;ref&gt;Waser, NM. 1983. The adaptive nature of floral traits: ideas and evidence. 242-285. In LA Real (Ed.). Pollination Biology. Academic Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and many pollinators have learned to associate these floral signals with the reward that is present there.&lt;ref&gt;Menzel, R. 1985. Learning in honey bees in an ecological and behavioural context. 55-74. In B Holldobler and M Lindauer (Eds.). Experimental Behavioral Ecology. Stuttgart: Gustav Fischer.&lt;/ref&gt; As pollinators are essential in the process of pollen transfer (and therefore, reproductive success) of many [[angiosperms]], visitation behavior will impose [[frequency-dependent selection]] on the flower morphs that they visit.&lt;ref name="levin" /&gt; If pollinators selectively visit a particular morph, this will cause this morph to increase in frequency, and may ultimately lead to the fixation of this [[phenotype]],&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, V. 1984. Polymorphism under apostatic and aposematic selection. Heredity, 53: 677-686.&lt;/ref&gt; known as [[directional selection]]. Alternatively, if rare morphs are preferred, this should promote [[phenotypic variation|phenotypic diversity]], known as [[balancing selection|balancing]] or [[stabilizing selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, B. 1962a. Balanced polymorphism and the diversity of sympatric species, 47-70. In D Nichols (Ed.). Taxonomy and Geography. Systematics Association, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, B. 1962b. Natural selection in mixed populations of two polymophyic snails. Heredity, 17: 319-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in frequency-dependent selection dates back to the time of Charles Darwin, who predicted that insects should demonstrate floral constancy&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1876. The effects of cross- and self-fertilization in the animal kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; and puzzled over the occurrence of deceptive orchid species.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1888. Fertilisation of orchids: the various contrivances by which orchids are fertilised by insects, 2nd ed. London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon received little attention until the 1970s when Donald Levin suggested that one of the most important factors determining pollinator visitation behavior is the floral trait's frequency in the population relative to other floral elements.&lt;ref name="levin" /&gt; Since this time, attention has focussed on understanding how obligately pollinated, unrewarding species can persist as they offer pollinators no incentive to visit.&lt;ref name="S97b"&gt;Smithson, A and MR Macnair. 1997b. Negative frequency-dependent selection by pollinators on artificial flowers without rewards. Evolution, 51: 715-723.&lt;/ref&gt; Much less research has been conducted on frequency-dependent foraging on rewarding species, but experiments using bumblebees have illustrated that frequency likely plays a role in reproductive success of flowering plants.&lt;ref name="S96"&gt;Smithson, A and MR Macnair. 1996. Frequency-dependent selection of pollinators: mechanisms and consequences with regard to behaviour in bumblebees Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). J. Evol. Biol., 9: 571-588.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bumblebee heuchera.jpg|thumb|200px|Bumblebee with tongue extracted about to visit a ''[[Heuchera]]'' plant for nectar.]]

==Experimental evidence==
Researchers studying frequency-dependent visitation behavior seek to understand if pollinator preference is strong enough to induce fixation of traits or to maintain floral polymorphisms observed in natural populations.&lt;ref name="S2"&gt;Smithson, A. 2001. Pollinator preference, frequency dependence, and floral evolution. 237-258. In LD Chittka and JD Thomson (Eds.). Cognitive ecology of pollination: animal behaviour and floral evolution. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory experiments use artificial flowers to test how pollinator preference varies with frequency. Typical experiments use two or more colored discs or artificial flowers (to represent flower morphs) that are arranged in various patterns and frequencies.&lt;ref name="S97a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S97b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt; It is predicted that if pollinators do not exhibit frequency-dependent foraging, morph preference will not correlate with the relative frequency of that morph. Instead, this preference may depend on some frequency-independent quality, such as an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|innate]] attraction toward a certain color.&lt;ref name="lu"&gt;Lunau, K and EJ Maier. 1995. Innate colour preferences of flower visitors. J. Comp. Physiol. A., 177: 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Western honey bee.jpg|thumb|200px|Honeybee on a blue flower.]]

===Bumblebees===

====Laboratory experiments====
Frequency-dependent foraging has most often been observed and studied in [[bumblebees]] (''Bombus'') as they tend to forage for long periods of time without becoming satiated, making them ideal experimental subjects.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt; Simple experiments using two morphs have revealed that after visiting many flowers (more than 100) bumblebees tend to prefer to visit the common morph when rewards associated with both morphs are equal.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt; This pattern is consistent for a variety of nectar concentrations.&lt;ref name="S2" /&gt; An exception to this pattern occurs when one morph contains variable amounts of nectar. This reward variability tends to cause the strength of the observed frequency dependence to decrease. However, when both rare and common morphs are unrewarding, bumblebees tend to reverse their behavioral pattern and demonstrate rare morph preference.&lt;ref name="S97b" /&gt;
[[Image:Dawn Endico Bee.jpg|thumb|200px|Corolla morphs may not be as distinctly colored in natural populations as they are in laboratory experiments.]]
Even though these experiments demonstrate that bumblebees forage in a frequency-dependent manner, the strength of this response can be asymmetric for different colors. For example, experiments using blue and yellow discs to represent corolla colors demonstrated that, although bumblebees preferentially foraged on the most common morph when rewards were present, the threshold for switching to the common morph was different for both colors.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt; Bumblebees exhibit an innate preference for blue corollas, as this color is very conspicuous to bees against green-colored backgrounds.&lt;ref name="lu" /&gt; It was observed that in order for bees to switch from blue flowers to yellow, the yellow-to-blue ratio had to be much higher than the ratio of blue-to-yellow flowers that were required for the opposite switch.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt; In other words, bees would forage on blue flowers until morphs of this colour reached relatively lower frequencies compared to yellow flowers. However, this preference for blue was not as pronounced when both morphs contained high levels of nectar. Therefore, frequency-dependent preferences must be considered along-with frequency-independent preferences to truly understand the visitation behavior of pollinators.&lt;ref name="S2" /&gt; Additionally, when density of equally rewarding color morphs were manipulated, bumblebees still preferred to forage on the common morphs, even at high densities.&lt;ref name="S97a" /&gt;

====Field experiments====
Experiments conducted in the field have yielded mixed results. Some studies have demonstrated that bumblebees prefer the relatively common corolla color,&lt;ref&gt;Epperson, BK and MT Clegg. 1987. Frequency-dependent variation for outcrossing rate among flower-color morphs of Ipomoea purpurea. Evolution, 41: 1302-1311.&lt;/ref&gt; but in other studies there did not appear to be any observable pattern of bee visitation behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, KN. 1996. Pollinator behavior and postpollination reproductive success in alternative floral phenotypes of Clarkia gracilis (Onagraceae). Int J Plant Sci., 157: 733-738.&lt;/ref&gt; This discrepancy between laboratory and field studies may be due to the fact that laboratory studies use highly contrasting corolla colors and it is likely that color polymorphisms in the wild are not this distinct, making frequency-dependence weaker in natural settings.&lt;ref name="S2" /&gt; Additionally, in natural populations multiple traits that are attractive to pollinators may be genetically correlated with one another ([[pleiotropy]]&lt;ref&gt;Waser, NM and MV Price. 1981. Pollinator choice and stabolizing selection for flower color in Delphinium nelsonii. Evolution, 35: 376-390.&lt;/ref&gt;), so looking at pollinator response to a single trait in isolation may not be appropriate under these circumstances.&lt;ref name="S2" /&gt; Also, frequency-dependent foraging is not apparent until many flowers have been visited (more than 100). Therefore, considering morph frequency within localized patches of flowers in natural settings may not be sufficient. Instead, morph frequency may need to be calculated over large spatial ranges to determine the extent to which pollinators are foraging in a frequency-dependent manner.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt;

[[Image:Monarch Butterfly Pink Zinnia 1800px.jpg|thumb|150px|A monarch butterfly drinking nectar from a Zinnia flower.]]

===Other insects===
Although studies of frequency-dependent foraging in other pollinator groups seems to be rare, at least one study has demonstrated that [[butterflies]] prefer to visit common corolla shapes. This observation was based on reduced seed set of rare morphs in field studies.&lt;ref name="levin" /&gt;

==Mechanisms==

===Positive frequency-dependent foraging===
Foraging on common morphs will be beneficial if these common morphs are associated with a higher reward than rare morphs. However, if rare morphs have similar nectar quality, skipping over these equally rewarding flowers appears to be inconsistent with [[optimal foraging theory]].&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur, RH and ER Pianka. 1966. On the optimal use of a patchy environment. Am. Nat., 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Several hypotheses have been proposed to suggest how this visitation pattern is maintained.

====Search image hypothesis====
It has been observed that [[predation|predators]] tend to select the most common morph in a population or species.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, JA. 1988. Frequency-dependent selection by predators. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 319: 485-503.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[prey detection|search image hypothesis]]'' proposes that an individual's [[sensory system]] becomes better able to detect a specific [[predation|prey]] phenotype after recent experience with that same phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, L. 1960. The natural control of insects in pinewoods. I. Factors influencing the intensity of predation by songbirds. Arch. Neerl. Zool., 13: 265-343.&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that plant-pollinator interactions differ from predator-prey relationships, as it is beneficial to both the plant and animal for the pollinator to locate the plant. However, it has been suggested that [[Flower constancy#Memory limitation as an explanation for flower constancy|cognitive constraints]] on [[short-term memory]] capabilities may limit pollinators from identifying and handling more than one floral type at a time,&lt;ref&gt;Dukas, R and LA Real. 1993. Learning constraints and floral choice behaviour in bumble bees. Anim. Behav., 46: 637-644.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chittka, L and JD Thomson. 1997. Sensori-moyor learning and its relevance for task specialization in bumble bees. Behav Ecol Sociobiol., 41: 385-398.&lt;/ref&gt; making plant-pollinator relationships theoretically similar to predator-prey relationships in regards to the ability to identify food sources.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt; Although plant traits that have evolved to attract pollinators are not [[crypsis|cryptic]], corolla colors can be more or less conspicuous with the background&lt;ref&gt;Menzel, R and A Shmida. 1993. The ecology of flower colours and the natural colour vision of insect pollinators. The Israeli flora as a case study. Biol. Rev., 68: 81-120.&lt;/ref&gt; and pollinators that are more efficient at detecting a particular morph will minimize their [[optimal foraging theory|search time]]. Studies have demonstrated that the degree of frequency-dependence increases with the number of flowers visited, which suggests this is a learned response that develops gradually.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt;

[[Image:Wildflowers in SNRA 2.JPG|thumb|250px|Flower morphs may differ in their relative conspicuousness against the background.]]

====Search rate hypotheses====
Alternative mechanisms, such as the ''optimal search rate hypothesis''&lt;ref&gt;Gendron, RP and JER Staddon. 1983. Searching for cryptic prey: the effect of search rate. Am. Nat., 121: 172-186.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''stare duration hypothesis''&lt;ref&gt;Endler, JA. 1991. Interactions between predators and prey, 169-196. In JR Krebs and NB Davies (Eds.). Behavioural Ecology, and Evolutionary Approach. 3rd edition. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; both propose that there is a tradeoff between search time and the probability of detecting prey. It has been demonstrated that when both density and frequency were manipulated, the strength of the preference for the common morph does not weaken with increased overall density, even when colors that are not innately preferred are the common morph.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt; These results are consistent with both of these search time hypotheses, as bees tend to decrease their speed travelling between flowers when density is high, and therefore, may be more efficient at recognizing less conspicuous yellow flowers at lower speeds.&lt;ref name="S97a" /&gt;

====Switching attention hypothesis====
Studies on other organisms have provided evidence that foraging can occur in long runs, but this preference develops after only visiting a few morphs.&lt;ref name="dawk"&gt;Dawkins, M. 1971. Shifts of 'attention' in chicks during feeding. Anim. Behav., 19: 575-582.&lt;/ref&gt; When presented with two equally rewarding morphs, it has been demonstrated that an organism may select to exclusively forage on one morph for a variable amount of time, and then switch to the alternative morph and repetitively forage on this morph.&lt;ref name="dawk" /&gt; Under this ''switching attention hypothesis'', selectively foraging on the common morph can occur without invoking a learned response, as the probability of visiting a particular morph first increases as the relative frequency of that morph increases. In other words, it is likely pollinators will select common morphs first due to chance since they are more common and will continue to forage on these morphs during foraging bouts.&lt;ref name="S96" /&gt;

===Negative frequency-dependent foraging===
Pollinators appear to forage in a negative frequency-dependent manner when flowers do not provide nectar rewards, likely to avoid unrewarding morphs. This behaviour results in [[disassortative mating]] between different morph types.&lt;ref name="S97b" /&gt; However, it seems likely that deceptive species would have low reproductive success as pollinators would learn to avoid areas where only unrewarding species are present.&lt;ref&gt;Gumbert, A and J Kunze. 2001. Colour similarity to rewarding model plants affects pollination in a food deceptive orchid, Orchis boryi. Biol J Linn Soc., 72: 419-433.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dactylorhiza sambucina pink NRM.jpg|thumb|250px|A deceptive orchid, ''Dactylorhiza sambucina'', does not provide a nectar reward for its pollinaors.]]

====Naive pollinators====
One hypothesis as to how unrewarding species can persist in the population is that they only receive visits from naive pollinators.&lt;ref name="nil"&gt;Nilsson, LA. 1980. The pollination ecology of Dactylorhiza sambucina (Orchidaceae). Botaniska Notiser, 133: 367-385.&lt;/ref&gt; As pollinators do not appear to be able to distinguish between rewarding and unrewarding flowers prior to landing,&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, JD. 1986. Pollen transport and deposition by bumble bees in Erythronium – Influences of floral nectar and bee grooming. J. Ecology, 74: 329-341.&lt;/ref&gt; they need to make test visits so they can learn to avoid particular morph types.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich, B. 1975. Bee flowers: a hypothesis on flower variety and blooming times. Evolution, 29: 325-334.&lt;/ref&gt; When a preferred rewarding morph type becomes locally depleted, pollinators may be initially attracted to unrewarding morphs if these morphs exploit signals that are innately attractive&lt;ref name="nil" /&gt; or closely [[floral mimicry|mimic]] rewarding species.&lt;ref&gt;Dafni, A. 1984. Mimicry and deception in pollination. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics. 15: 259-278.&lt;/ref&gt; However, under this hypothesis, the pollinator should learn to associate this morph with no reward and consequently avoid it on future foraging bouts.

====Negative frequency-dependent selection====
A different hypothesis does not assume that only naive pollinators visit [[floral mimicry|deceptive species]]. Instead, the negative reinforcement associated with visiting an unrewarding flower is assumed to be stored in short-term memory.&lt;ref name="S97b" /&gt; This causes the pollinator to go to a different morph type on its next visit. In other words, if deceptive species were to occur at a low enough frequency that pollinators do not encounter them very often, it is unlikely they will have the opportunity to relocate this information to their [[long-term memory]]. Studies have shown that the number of flowers of an unrewarding morph type that are sampled depends on the frequency of those morphs within a population.&lt;ref name="S2" /&gt; For example, many species of obligately animal-pollinated, deceptive orchids that co-occur with rewarding flowers are only reproductively successful when they occur at low frequencies.&lt;ref name="S97b" /&gt; It is worth mentioning that these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive in that morph populations that are visited by naive pollinators are also likely to be found at low frequencies relative to rewarding morphs.

==Implications==
Regardless of the mechanism, pollinators foraging in a frequency-dependent manner on common morphs will lead to [[assortative mating]] between similar phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, ML. 1987. Reproductive biology of petal colour variants in wild populations of Raphanus saticus: I. Pollinator response to color morphs. Am. J. Bot., 74: 178-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, rare morphs may be at a disadvantage if reproductive success is correlated with number of pollinator visits, and this may lead to higher rates of [[self-pollination|selfing]] and ultimately [[inbreeding depression]], in [[Self-incompatibility#Self-compatibility|self-compatible]] plants.&lt;ref name="S97b" /&gt; The potential for a decrease in [[genetic diversity]] due to assortative mating can have negative implications.

===Climate change===
In response to climate change, plants may begin to flower earlier in the season due to regional [[aridification]] and a rise in mean global temperature.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. 2007. Climate change 2007: the physical science basis. Contribution of working group I to the fourth assessment report of the IPCC. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, reproductive success of flowering plants that are obligately pollinated ultimately depends on a corresponding change in the timing of pollinator visitors.&lt;ref name="for"&gt;Forrest, J and JD Thomson. 2008. Pollinator experience, neophobia and the evolution of flowering time. Proc. R. Soc. B, 276: 935-943.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest bloomers of any species will be rare since the majority of conspecific plants have not yet flowered. Since many pollinators prefer to forage on common phenotypes, the flowers that bloom earliest in the season may be skipped.&lt;ref name="for" /&gt; This may lead to a constraint on plant flowering evolution and the inability of flowering plants to adapt to changing environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="S2" /&gt;

===Hybrid zones===
Additionally, positive frequency-dependent foraging may help maintain [[hybrid zone]]s between closely related species.&lt;ref name="tas"&gt;Tastard, E, C Andalo, M Giurfa, M Burrus and C Thebaud. 2008. Flower colour variation across a hybrid zone in Antirrhinum as perceived by bumblebee pollinators. Arthropod-Plant Interactions, 2: 237-246.&lt;/ref&gt; Hybrid zones generally contain a wide variety of phenotypes, including novel or extremely rare morphs. Since certain pollinators tend to prefer common morphs, there is a low probability that they will visit rare morphs in the hybrid zone, thus keeping [[gene flow]] between species relatively low.&lt;ref name="tas" /&gt;

'''Friedrich A. Kittler''' (June 12, 1943 &amp;ndash; October 18, 2011) was a literary scholar and a media theorist. His works relate to [[Mass media|media]], [[technology]], and the [[military]].

==Biography==
Friedrich Adolf Kittler was born in 1943 in [[Rochlitz]] in [[Saxony]]. His family fled with him to [[West Germany]] in 1958, where from 1958 to 1963 he went to a [[natural sciences]] and [[modern languages]] ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' in [[Lahr]] in the [[Black Forest]], and thereafter, until 1972, he studied [[German studies]], [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[philology]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg]] in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]. During his studies, he was especially influenced by the writings of [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].

In 1976, Kittler received his doctorate in philosophy after a thesis on the poet [[Conrad Ferdinand Meyer]]. Between 1976 and 1986 he worked as academic assistant at the university's ''Deutsches Seminar''. In 1984, he earned his [[Habilitation]] in the field of Modern German Literary History.

He had several stints as a Visiting Assistant Professor or Visiting Professor at universities in the [[United States]], such as the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] and [[Stanford University]].

From 1986 to 1990, he headed the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG's]] ''Literature and Media Analysis'' project in [[Kassel]] and in 1987 he was appointed Professor of Modern German Studies at the [[Ruhr University]]. In 1993 he was appointed to the chair for Media Aesthetics and History at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].

In 1993, Kittler was awarded the "Siemens Media Arts Prize" (''Siemens-Medienkunstpreis'') by [[Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie|ZKM Karlsruhe]] (''Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie'', or "Centre for Art and Media Technology") for his research in the field of media theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader%241107 Siemens Medienkunstpreis 1993/ Friedrich Kittle] ZKM. Museum für Neue Kunst.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was recognized in 1996 as a Distinguished Scholar at [[Yale University]] and in 1997 as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]]. Kittler was a member of the Hermann von Helmholtz Centre for Culture and the research group ''Bild Schrift Zahl'' ("Picture Writing Number") (DFG).  

Among Kittler's theses was his tendency to argue, with a mixture of polemicism, apocalypticism, erudition, and humor, that technological conditions were closely bound up with epistemology and ontology itself. This claim and his style of argumention is aptly summed up in his dictum "Nur was schaltbar ist, ist überhaupt"—a phrase that could be translated as "Only that which is switchable, exists" or more freely, "Only that which can be switched, can be." This phrase plays both on the concept that in principle any representation can be presented according to the on/off binary logic of computing. Kittler goes one step further by suggesting that, conversely, anything that can't be "switched" can't really "be," at least under current technical conditions. He invoked this doctrine on his deathbed in 2011. Dying in a hospital in Berlin and sustained only by a medical instruments, his final words were "Alle Apparate ausschalten", which translates as "switch off all apparatuses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2011/11/09/tom-mccarthy/kittler-and-the-sirens/ London Review of Books article].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Friedrich Kittler is influential in the new approach to [[media influence|media theory]] that grew popular starting in the 1980s, [[new media]] ({{lang-de|technische Medien}}, which translates roughly to "technical media"). Kittler's central project is to "prove to the human sciences [...] their technological-media ''a priori''" ([[Hartmut Winkler]]), or in his own words: "Driving the human out of the humanities",&lt;ref&gt;This loses something in the translation, since "spirit" is "Geist" in [[German language|German]], and "[[humanities]]" is "Geisteswissenschaften", or "spiritual sciences".&lt;/ref&gt; a title that he gave a work that he published in 1980.

Kittler sees an autonomy in technology and therefore disagrees with [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s reading of the media as "extensions of man": "Media are not pseudopods for extending the human body. They follow the logic of escalation that leaves us and written history behind it. (Kittler in ''Geschichte der Kommunikationsmedien''. In: Jörg Huber, Alois Martin Müller (publishers): ''Raum und Verfahren''.)

Consequently, he sees in writing literature, in writing programmes and in burning structures into [[silicon chip]]s a complete continuum: "As we know and simply do not say, no human being writes anymore. [...] Today, human writing runs through inscriptions burnt into silicon by electronic lithography [...]. The last historic act of writing may thus have been in the late seventies when a team of Intel engineers [plotted] the hardware architecture of their first integrated microprocessor." (Kittler, ''Es gibt keine Software''. In: ders.: ''Draculas Vermächtnis. Technische Schriften''.)

{{cquote|And Kittler is a good friend of mine – I sponsored a chair at the Humboldt University for two years. He is not mainstream. Historians of music come and say, “But he did not write his thesis on [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]].” And all the professors of philosophy say, “But did he write a thesis on [[Kant]] or Heidegger?” No, Kittler is a mixture: Kittler is in between philosophy, the history of music, computer science, and media theory. That’s why he is completely outstanding. We have some fundamental heroes in Germany, really outstanding people on the level of [[Deleuze]], [[Derrida]], Lacan, [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]] … Among these are [[Bazon Brock]], Friedrich Kittler, [[Peter Sloterdijk|Sloterdijk]], [[Horst Bredekamp|Bredekamp]], or [[Hans Belting]]. These people will last longer than I will in this book. In 50 years, each of them will be known as people who had been very sensitive to changes of the media.—[[Hubert Burda]], 2011&lt;ref&gt;[[David Woodard|Woodard, D.]], "In Media Res," ''[[032c]]'', Sum 2011, [http://032c.com/2012/in-media-res/ pp. 180–189].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|180–189}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4352">'''Fuzzy rules''' are used within [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy logic systems]] to infer an output based on input variables. [[Modus ponens]] and [[modus tollens]] are the most important rules of inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A mathematical introduction to logic|last=B.|first=Enderton, Herbert|date=2001|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0122384523|edition= 2nd|location=San Diego, Calif.|oclc=45830890}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A modus ponens rule is in the form
:Premise: ''x is A''
:Implication: '''''IF''' x is A '''THEN''' y is B''
:Consequent: ''y is B''

In crisp logic, the premise ''x is A'' can only be true or false. However, in a fuzzy rule, the premise ''x is A'' and the consequent ''y is B'' can be true to a degree, instead of entirely true or entirely false.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uncertain rule-based fuzzy logic systems : introduction and new directions|last=1938-|first=Mendel, Jerry M.,|date=2001|publisher=Prentice Hall PTR|isbn=978-0130409690|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|oclc=45314121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved by representing the linguistic variables ''A'' and ''B'' using [[fuzzy set]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a fuzzy rule, modus ponens is extended to ''generalised modus ponens:.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;''

:Premise: ''x is A''*
:Implication: '''''IF''' x is A '''THEN''' y is B''
:Consequent: ''y is B''*

The key difference is that the premise ''x is A'' can be only partially true. As a result, the consequent ''y is B'' is also partially true. Truth is represented as a [[real number]] between 0 and 1, where 0 is false and 1 is true.

== Comparison between Boolean and fuzzy logic rules ==
As an example, consider a rule used to control a three-speed fan. A binary IF-THEN statement may be

:'''IF'''   ''temperature'' &lt;math&gt;\geq&lt;/math&gt; ''30''
:'''THEN'''  ''fan speed is 3''

The disadvantage of this rule is that it uses a strict temperature as a threshold, but the user may want the fan to still function at this speed when temperature = 29.9. A fuzzy IF-THEN statement may be
:'''IF'''   ''temperature is hot''
:'''THEN'''  ''fan speed is fast''

where ''hot'' and ''fast'' are described using [[fuzzy set]]s.

== Fuzzy rule connectors ==
Rules can connect multiple variables through [[fuzzy set operations]] using [[t-norm]]s and [[T-norm|t-conorms]].

'''T-norms''' are used as an ''AND'' connector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin Larsen|first=P.|date=1980|title=Industrial applications of fuzzy logic control|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020737380800502|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|volume=12|issue=1|pages=3–10|doi=10.1016/s0020-7373(80)80050-2|issn=0020-7373|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mamdani|first=E.H.|date=1974|title=Application of fuzzy algorithms for control of simple dynamic plant|journal=Proceedings of the Institution of Electrical Engineers|volume=121|issue=12|pages=1585|doi=10.1049/piee.1974.0328|issn=0020-3270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fuzzy Set Theory - and Its Applications|last=H.-J.|first=Zimmermann,|date=1991|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401579490|edition= Second, revised|location=Dordrecht|oclc=851369348}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example,

:'''IF'''   ''temperature is hot '''AND''' humidity is high''
:'''THEN'''  ''fan speed is fast''

A degree of truth is assigned to ''temperature is hot'' and to ''humidity is high.'' The result of a t-norm operation on these two degrees is used as the degree of truth that ''fan speed is fast''.

'''T-conorms''' are used as an ''OR'' connector.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For example,

:'''IF'''   ''temperature is hot '''OR''' humidity is high''
:'''THEN'''  ''fan speed is fast''

The result of a t-conorm operation on these two degrees is used as the degree of truth that ''fan speed is fast''.

The [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of a fuzzy set is used as a negator.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example,

:'''IF'''   ''temperature is '''NOT''' hot''
:'''THEN'''  ''fan speed is slow''

The fuzzy set ''not hot'' is the complement of ''hot.'' The degree of truth assigned to ''temperature is not hot'' is used as the degree of truth that ''fan speed is slow''.

T-conorms are less commonly used as rules can be represented by ''AND'' and ''OR'' connectors exclusively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4336">'''Human–machine system''' is a [[system]] in which the functions of a human operator (or a group of operators) and a machine are integrated. This term can also be used to emphasize the view of such a system as a single entity that interacts with external environment.

A manual system consists of hand tools and other aids which are coupled by a human operator who controls the operation. Operators of such systems use their own physical energy as the power source{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}. The system could range from a person with a hammer to a person with a super-strength giving [[exoskeleton]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.

Human machine system engineering is different from the more general and well known fields like [[human–computer interaction]] and sociotechnical engineering in that it focuses on complex, dynamic control systems that often are partially automated (such as flying an airplane). it also studies human problem-solving in naturalistic settings or in high-fidelity simulation environments. [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Human-machine+systems]

==Human–machine choreography==
The area of human–machine choreography is yet to be extensively explored. How body-structure can be extended through machine mechanisms points to how the body can perform beyond its biological form and functions as well as beyond the local space it inhabits. How human movement is transduced into machine motion and then can be both expressed and extended into virtual performance on the web promises new possibilities in both conceptual approach and aesthetic application. For example, incorporating virtual camera views of the performing human–machine system enriches the choreography and intensifies the artistic result. [http://crossings.tcd.ie/issues/1.2/Stelarc/]

==The Muscle Machine==
The Muscle Machine is a hybrid human–robot walking machine. Designed by artist James Stelarc (who has also created other such systems), it is an exoskeleton with six robotic legs that are controlled by the leg and hand movements of its pilot.

===Mechanism===
The rubber muscles contract when inflated and extend when exhausted. This results in a more reliable and robust engineering design. The body stands on the ground within the chassis of the machine, which incorporates a lower body exoskeleton connecting it to the robot. Encoders on the hip joints provides the data that will allow the human controller to move and direct the machine as well as vary the speed at which it will travel. The action of the human operator lifting a leg lifts the three alternate machine legs and swings them forward. By turning its torso, the body makes the machine walk in the direction it is facing. Thus the interface and interaction is more direct, allowing an intuitive human-machine choreography. The walking system, with attached accelerometer sensors generates data that is converted to sounds that augment the acoustical pneumatics and machine mechanism operation. Once the machine is in motion, it is no longer applicable to ask whether the human or machine is in control as they become fully integrated and move as one. The six-legged robot both extends the body and transforms its bipedal gait into a 6-legged insect-like movement. The appearance and movement of the machine legs are  both limb-like and wing-like motion. [http://www.stelarc.va.com.au/documents/zombiesandcyborgs.pdf]

==In popular culture==
Human–machine systems have been portrayed in the media on many accounts. [[Cyborgs]], seen in movies such as [[The Terminator]] and [[Robocop]], are fantastical depictions of what human-machine systems may, one day, look like. [http://sociologyindex.com/cyborgs.htm]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4221">'''Interactive Specialization''' is a theory of brain development proposed by the British developmental cognitive neuroscientist [[Mark H. Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]], formerly head of the  Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbcd.bbk.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Birkbeck, University of London]], London and who is now Head of Psychology at the University of Cambridge.

In his book ''Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience'' 
,&lt;ref name="Johnson2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Mark|title=Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, 2nd Ed.|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford|year=2005|isbn= 1-4051-2629-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson contrasts two views of development. According to the first, the maturational hypothesis, the relationship between structure and function (i.e. which parts of the brain perform a particular task) is static, and specific cognitive skills come “on-line” as the cortical circuitry intrinsic to a particular task matures. Johnson likens this to a "mosaic" view of development.

According to the second, the Interactive Specialization (IS) &lt;ref name="Johnson2005" /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Johnson, M.H.|title=Functional brain development in infants: Elements of an interactive specialization framework|year=2000|journal=Child Development|issue=1
|pages=75–81|volume=71|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00120|pmid=10836560}}&lt;/ref&gt; hypothesis, development is 
not a unidirectional maturational process, but rather a set of complex, dynamic and back-propagated interactions between genetics, brain, body and environment. Development is not a simple question of a brain being built according to a pre-specified genetic blueprint - rather, the components of the brain are interacting with each other constantly - even prenatally, when patterns of spontaneous firing of cells in the eyes (before they have opened) transmit signals that appear to help develop the layered structure of the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] 
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=O'Leary D.D.M |author2=Nakagawa Y. |title=Patterning centers, regulatory genes and extrinsic mechanisms controlling arealization of the neocortex|year=2002|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|issue=1
|pages=14–25|volume=12|doi=10.1016/S0959-4388(02)00285-4|pmid=11861160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis has attracted increasing attention in recent years as a number of neuroimaging studies on younger children have provided data that appears to fit specific predictions made by Johnson's model 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Redcay E. |author2=Haist F. |author3=Courchesne E. |title=Paper: Functional neuroimaging of speech perception during a pivotal period in language acquisition|year=2008|journal=Developmental Science|issue=2

.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Amso D. |author2=Casey B.J. |title=Paper: Beyond what develops when: neuroimaging may inform how cognition changes with development|year=2006|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|issue=1
|pages=24–28|volume=15|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2006.00400.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
In 1996, Johnson co-authored (with [[Jeffrey Elman]], [http://www.psyc.bbk.ac.uk/research/DNL/personalpages/annette.html Annette Karmiloff-Smith], [[Elizabeth Bates]], Domenico Parisi, and Kim Plunkett), the book ''[[Rethinking Innateness]]''
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elman|first=Jeffrey|title=Rethinking Innateness: A Connectionist Perspective on Development|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|year=1996|isbn= 0-262-55030-X|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
, which argues against a strong nativist (innate) view on development. Other key influences include Gilbert Gottlieb's theory of Probabilistic Epigenesis 
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gottlieb, G., Lickliter, R.|title=FProbabilistic epigenesis|year=2007|journal=Developmental Science|issue=1
|pages=1–11|volume=10|pmid=17181692|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00556.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; a framework that emphasizes the reciprocity and ubiquity of gene-environment interaction in the realization of all phenotypes, and work on developmental disorders by [[Annette Karmiloff-Smith]].

The '''''Journal of the British Interplanetary Society''''' ('''''JBIS''''') is a monthly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] that was established in 1934. The journal covers research on [[astronautics]] and [[space science]] and [[space technology|technology]], including spacecraft design, nozzle theory, launch vehicle design, mission architecture, [[space station]]s, lunar exploration, [[spacecraft propulsion]], robotic and manned exploration of the solar system, [[interstellar travel]], [[interstellar communication]]s, [[extraterrestrial intelligence]], [[philosophy]], and [[cosmology]]. It is published monthly by the [[British Interplanetary Society]].

== History ==
The journal was established in 1934 when the British Interplanetary Society was founded. The inaugural editorial stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The ultimate aim of the society, of course, is the conquest of space and thence interplanetary travel.....(the) immediate task is the stimulation of public interest in the subject of interplanetary travel and the dissemination of knowledge concerning the true nature of the difficulties which as present hinder its achievements''.&lt;ref&gt;Interplanetary A History of The British Interplanetary Society, Bob Parkinson, BIS Publication, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The first issue was only a six-page [[pamphlet]], but has the distinction of being the world's oldest surviving astronautical publication.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

[[File:Kon-Tiki by Gustavo Gerdel.jpg|thumb|250px|The Kon-Tiki raft exhibited at Oslo Museum]]
The '''''Kon-Tiki'' expedition''' was a 1947 journey by [[raft]] across the Pacific Ocean from South America to the Polynesian islands, led by Norwegian explorer and writer [[Thor Heyerdahl]]. The raft was named ''Kon-Tiki'' after the [[Inca]] sun god, [[Viracocha]], for whom "Kon-Tiki" was said to be an old name. ''[[The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas|Kon-Tiki]]'' is also the name of Heyerdahl's book; the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Academy Award]]-winning [[Kon-Tiki (1950 film)|documentary film]] chronicling his adventures; and the [[Kon-Tiki (2012 film)|2012 dramatized feature film]] nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].

Heyerdahl believed that people from South America could have settled Polynesia in [[pre-Columbian]] times. His aim in mounting the ''Kon-Tiki'' expedition was to show, by using only the materials and technologies available to those people at the time, that there were no technical reasons to prevent them from having done so. Although the expedition carried some modern equipment, such as a radio, watches, charts, [[sextant]], and metal knives, Heyerdahl argued they were incidental to the purpose of proving that the raft itself could make the journey.

The ''Kon-Tiki'' expedition was funded by private loans, along with donations of equipment from the [[United States Army]]. Heyerdahl and a small team went to [[Peru]], where, with the help of dockyard facilities provided by the Peruvian authorities, they constructed the raft out of [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]] logs and other native materials in an indigenous style as recorded in illustrations by Spanish [[conquistadores]]. The trip began on April 28, 1947. Heyerdahl and five companions sailed the raft for 101 days over 6,900&amp;nbsp;km (4,300 miles) across the Pacific Ocean before smashing into a [[reef]] at [[Raroia]] in the [[Tuamotus]] on August 7, 1947. The crew made successful landfall and all returned safely.

Thor Heyerdahl's book about his experience became a bestseller. It was published in Norwegian in 1948 as ''The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas'', later reprinted as ''Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft''. It appeared with great success in English in 1950, also in many other languages.  A documentary [[motion picture]] about the expedition, also called ''Kon-Tiki'', was produced from a write-up and expansion of the crew's filmstrip notes and won an [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Academy Award]] in 1951. It was directed by [[Thor Heyerdahl]] and edited by [[Olle Nordemar]]. The voyage was also chronicled in the documentary TV-series ''The Kon-Tiki Man: The Life and Adventures of Thor Heyerdahl'', directed by Bengt Jonson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kon-tiki.no/Events/indexold.html ''The Kon-Tiki Man'' episode breakdown] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028203635/http://www.kon-tiki.no/Events/indexold.html |date=October 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original ''Kon-Tiki'' raft is now on display in the [[Kon-Tiki Museum]] at [[Bygdøy]] in [[Oslo]].

== Crew ==
''Kon-Tiki'' had a six-man crew, all of whom were Norwegian except for Bengt Danielsson, a Swede.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2ysYAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Watzinger+Raaby+Haugland&amp;dq=Watzinger+Raaby+Haugland |title=The Kon-Tiki Expedition  |first=Thor  |last=Thor Heyerdahl |publisher=Rand McNally|year= 1968 |accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thor Heyerdahl]] (1914–2002) was the expedition leader. He was also the author of the book of the expedition and the narrator of the story. Heyerdahl had studied the ancient people of South America and Polynesia and believed that there was a link between the two.
* [[Erik Hesselberg]] (1914–1972) was the navigator and artist. He painted the large Kon-Tiki figure on the raft's sail. His children's book ''Kon-Tiki and I'' appeared in Norwegian in 1949 and has since been published in more than 15 languages.
* [[Bengt Danielsson]] (1921–1997) took on the role of steward, in charge of supplies and daily rations.  Danielsson was a Swedish sociologist interested in [[human migration|human migration theory]].  He also served as translator, as he was the only member of the crew who spoke Spanish. He was also a voracious reader; his box aboard the raft contained many books.
* [[Knut Haugland]] (1917–2009) was a radio expert, decorated by the British in World War II for actions in the [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage]] that stalled what were believed to be Germany's plans to develop an [[atomic bomb]]. Haugland was the last surviving crew member; he died on Christmas Day, 2009 at the age of 92.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/last-crew-member-on-kon-tiki-expedition-dies.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Torstein Raaby]] (1918–1964) was also in charge of radio transmissions. He gained radio experience while hiding behind German lines during WWII, spying on the German battleship ''[[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]]''. His secret radio transmissions eventually helped guide in Allied bombers to sink the ship.
* [[Herman Watzinger]] (1910–1986) was an engineer whose area of expertise was in technical measurements.  He was the first to join Heyerdahl for the trip. He collected and recorded all sorts of data on the voyage. Much of what he recorded, such as weather data, was sent back to various people, since this area of the ocean was largely unstudied.

The expedition also carried a pet [[parrot]] named Lorita.

==Construction==
The main body of the float was composed of nine [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]] tree trunks up to {{convert|45|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|2|ft|cm|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in diameter, lashed together with {{convert|1+1/4|in|mm|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} [[hemp]] ropes. Cross-pieces of balsa logs {{convert|18|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} in diameter were lashed across the logs at {{convert|3|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} intervals to give lateral support. [[Pine]] splashboards clad the bow, and lengths of pine {{convert|1|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} thick and {{convert|2|ft|cm|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide were wedged between the balsa logs and used as [[centreboard]]s.

The main mast was made of lengths of mangrove wood lashed together to form an A-frame {{convert|29|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} high. Behind the main-mast was a cabin of plaited bamboo {{convert|14|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|8|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide was built about {{convert|4|-|5|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} high, and roofed with banana leaf thatch. At the stern was a {{convert|19|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long steering oar of mangrove wood, with a blade of fir. The main sail was {{convert|15|by|18|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} on a yard of bamboo stems lashed together. Photographs also show a top-sail above the main sail, and also a mizzen-sail, mounted at the stern.

The raft was partially decked in split bamboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LxMNAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Guardian+Rios&amp;dq=Guardian+Rios |title=Kon-Tiki: across the Pacific by raft|page=63 |first=Thor |last= Heyerdahl |publisher=Rand McNally |year= 1984|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main spars were a laminate of wood and reeds and Heyerdahl tested more than twenty different composites before settling on one that proved an effective compromise between bulk and torsional rigidity. No metal was used in the construction.

==Supplies==
''Kon-Tiki'' carried {{convert|275|USgal|l|order=flip}} of drinking water in 56 water cans, as well as a number of sealed bamboo rods. The purpose stated by Heyerdahl for carrying modern and ancient containers was to test the effectiveness of ancient water storage. For food ''Kon-Tiki'' carried 200 [[coconut]]s, [[sweet potato]]es, [[calabash|bottle gourds]] and other assorted fruit and roots. The [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps]] provided [[field ration]]s, tinned food and survival equipment. In return, the ''Kon-Tiki'' explorers reported on the quality and utility of the provisions. They also caught plentiful numbers of fish, particularly [[flying fish]], "[[mahi-mahi|dolphin fish]]", [[yellowfin tuna]], [[bonito]] and [[shark]].

==Communications==
[[File:NC-173, KonTiki.jpg|thumb|right|National NC-173 radio receiver used by the expedition.]]
The expedition carried an [[amateur radio]] station with the call sign of LI2B operated by former [[World War II]] [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norwegian resistance]] radio operators Knut Haugland and Torstein Raaby.&lt;ref name="arrlDec1947"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=QST |title=Kon-Tiki Communications – Well Done! |date=December 1947 |author=Anonymous |pages=69, 143–48 |publisher=The [[American Radio Relay League]]}}([http://p1k.arrl.org/cgi-bin/topdf.cgi?id=28028&amp;pub=qst pdf])&lt;/ref&gt;  Haugland and Raaby maintained regular communication with a number of American, Canadian, and South American stations that relayed ''Kon Tiki's'' status to the Norwegian Embassy in Washington, D.C. On August 5, Haugland made contact with a station in Oslo, Norway, {{convert|10000|mi|km|order=flip}} away.&lt;ref name="arrl"&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/features/2003/03/05/1/?nc=1 ''An LA, as in Norway, Story, by Bob Merriam, W1NTE''], March 5, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2002/04/24/1/ ''Thor Heyerdahl of Kon-Tiki fame dies at 87''], April 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kon Tiki's'' transmitters were powered by batteries and a hand-cranked generator and operated on the [[40-meter band|40]], [[20-meter band|20]], [[10-meter band|10]], and [[6-meter band]]s. Each unit was water resistant, used [[List of vacuum tubes#2E30|2E30]] [[vacuum tube]]s, and provided approximately 6 [[watt]]s of [[radio frequency|RF]] output; the equivalent of a small [[flashlight]].&lt;ref name="Heyerdahl2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thor Heyerdahl|title=Kon-Tiki|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_rby49uet8UC&amp;pg=PT148|accessdate=29 August 2013|date=7 May 2013|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4516-8592-3|pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two British 3-16&amp;nbsp;MHz Mark II transmitters were also carried on board, as was a VHF transmitter for communicating with aircraft and a hand-cranked [[Survival radio]] of the Gibson Girl type for 500 and 8280&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="arrlDec1947" /&gt;

The radio receiver used throughout the voyage, a [[National Radio Company]] NC-173, once required a thorough drying out after being soaked when landing in Raratonga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~postr/bapix/NC173.htm |title=Boatanchor Pix, National NC-173 |publisher=Oak.cats.ohiou.edu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823105931/http://www.ohio.edu/people/postr/bapix/NC173.htm|archivedate=August 23, 2016|date=September 23, 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew once used a hand-cranked emergency transmitter to send out an "all well, all well" message "just in time to head off a massive rescue attempt".&lt;ref name="ARRLinbrief"&gt;{{cite web|title=In Brief|url=http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2002/04/24/1/|website=American Radio Relay League|publisher=[[ARRL]]|accessdate=22 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021125203835/http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2002/04/24/1/|archivedate=November 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The call sign LI2B was used by Heyerdahl again in 1969–70, when he built a papyrus reed raft and sailed from Morocco to Barbados in an attempt to show a possible link between the civilization of ancient Egypt and the New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thor Heyerdahl|title=The Ra Expeditions|edition=English|year=1971

==The voyage==
''Kon-Tiki'' left [[Callao]], [[Peru]], on the afternoon of April 28, 1947. To avoid coastal traffic it was initially towed {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} out by the Fleet Tug ''Guardian Rios'' of the [[Peruvian Navy]], then sailed roughly west carried along on the [[Humboldt Current]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LxMNAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Guardian+Rios&amp;dq=Guardian+Rios |title=Kon-Tiki: across the Pacific by raft|page=98 |first=Thor |last= Heyerdahl |publisher=Rand McNally |year= 1984|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew's first sight of land was the atoll of [[Puka-Puka]] on July 30. On August 4, the 97th day after departure, ''Kon-Tiki'' reached the Angatau atoll. The crew made brief contact with the inhabitants of [[Fangatau|Angatau Island]], but were unable to land safely. Calculations made by Heyerdahl before the trip had indicated that 97 days was the minimum amount of time required to reach the Tuamotu islands, so the encounter with Angatau showed that they had made good time.

On August 7, the voyage came to an end when the raft struck a reef and was eventually beached on an uninhabited islet off [[Raroia]] [[atoll]] in the [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu]] group. The team had travelled a distance of around {{convert|6980|km|mi nmi|abbr=on}} in 101 days, at an average speed of {{convert|1.5|kn|km/h mph|1}}.

After spending a number of days alone on the tiny islet, the crew was greeted by men from a village on a nearby island who arrived in canoes, having seen washed-up flotsam from the raft. The crew were taken back to the native village, where they were feted with traditional dances and other festivities. Finally the crew were taken off Raroia to [[Tahiti]] by the French schooner ''Tamara'', with the salvaged ''Kon-Tiki'' in tow.

== Anthropology ==
[[Image:Kneeled moai Easter Island.jpg|thumb|A [[moai]]]]
Heyerdahl believed that the original inhabitants of [[Easter Island]] were migrants from Peru. He argued that the monumental statues known as [[moai]] resembled sculptures more typical of pre-Columbian Peru than any Polynesian designs. He believed that the Easter Island myth of a power struggle between two peoples called the [[Hanau epe]] and [[Hanau momoko]] was a memory of conflicts between the original inhabitants of the island and a later wave of Native Americans from the Northwest coast, eventually leading to the annihilation of the Hanau epe and the destruction of the island's culture and once-prosperous economy.&lt;ref&gt;Heyderdahl, Thor. ''Easter Island – The Mystery Solved''. Random House New York 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rose"&gt;Robert C. Suggs, "Kon-Tiki", in Rosemary G. Gillespie, D. A. Clague (eds), ''Encyclopedia of Islands'', University of California Press, 2009, pp. 515–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians consider that the Polynesians from the west were the original inhabitants and that the story of the Hanau epe is either pure myth, or a memory of internal tribal or class conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Long, "Does 'Rapa Nui' Take Artistic License Too Far?", Los Angeles Times, Friday August 26, 1994, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Flenley, Paul G. Bahn, The Enigmas of Easter Island: Island on the Edge, Oxford University Press, 2003, pp. 76, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven R. Fischer, Island at the End of the World: The Turbulent History of Easter Island, Reaktion Books, 2005, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Professor Erik Thorsby of the [[University of Oslo]] presented DNA evidence to the [[Royal Society]] which whilst agreeing with the west origin also identified a distinctive but smaller genetic contribution from South America.&lt;ref name="Richard Alleyne"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/8582150/Kon-Tiki-explorer-was-partly-right-Polynesians-had-South-American-roots.html|title=Kon-Tiki explorer was partly right – Polynesians had South American roots|publisher=Daily Telegraph|author=Richard Alleyne|date=17 Jun 2011|accessdate=17 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result was questioned in 2012 because of the possibility of contamination by South Americans after European contact with the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Did Easter Islanders Mix It Up With South Americans?|url = http://news.sciencemag.org/2012/02/did-easter-islanders-mix-it-south-americans|accessdate = 2015-10-25|publisher = [[Science (journal)|Science Magazine]]|date = 2012-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 further work by a team including Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas (from the Natural History Museum of Denmark) analysed the genomes of 27 native [[Rapa Nui people|Rapa Nui]] people and found that their DNA was on average 76 percent Polynesian, 8 percent Native American and 16 percent European. Analysis showed that "although the European lineage could be explained by contact with white Europeans after the island was 'discovered' in 1722 by Dutch sailors, the South American component was much older, dating to between about 1280 and 1495, soon after the island was first colonised by Polynesians in around 1200."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New findings show more contact between prehistoric humans|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/new-discoveries-show-more-contact-between-farflung-prehistoric-humans-than-had-been-thought-9814377.html|accessdate = 2015-10-25|date = 2014-10-23|website = The Independent|quote = Evidence found of contact between Easter Islanders and South America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later recreations of ''Kon-Tiki'' ==
{{refimprove|section|date=August 2018}}&lt;!--four subsections have no citations--&gt;
===''Seven Little Sisters''===
In 1954 [[William Willis (sailor)|William Willis]] sailed alone on a raft ''Seven Little Sisters'' from [[Peru]] to [[American Samoa]], successfully completing the journey.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, William (1955). ''The Epic Voyage of the Seven Little Sisters: A 6700 Mile Voyage Alone Across the Pacific''. London: Hutchinson&lt;/ref&gt; He sailed {{convert|6,700|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}, which was {{convert|2,200|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} farther than ''Kon-Tiki''. In a second great voyage ten years later, he rafted {{convert|7457|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from South America to Australia with a metal raft ''Age Unlimited''.

===''Kantuta''===
In 1955, the Czech explorer and adventurer [[Eduard Ingris]] attempted to recreate the ''Kon-Tiki'' expedition on a balsa raft called ''[[Kantuta Expeditions|Kantuta]]''. His first expedition, ''Kantuta I'', took place in 1955–1956 and led to failure. In 1959 Ingris built a new balsa raft, ''Kantuta II'', and tried to repeat the previous expedition. The second expedition was a success. Ingris was able to cross the Pacific Ocean on the balsa raft from Peru to Polynesia.

===''Tahiti-Nui''===
A French seafarer, [[Éric de Bisschop]], committed himself in a project he had had for some years: he built a Polynesian raft in order to cross the eastern Pacific Ocean from [[Tahiti]] to [[Chile]] (contrary to [[Thor Heyerdahl]]'s crossing); the ''Tahiti-Nui'' left [[Papeete]] with a crew of five on November 8, 1956. When near the [[Juan Fernández Islands]] (Chile) in May 1957, the raft was in a very poor state and they asked for a towing, but it was damaged during the operation and had to be abandoned, but they could keep all the equipment aboard.

===''Tahiti-Nui II''===
A second ''Tahiti-Nui'' was built in [[Constitución, Chile]], leaving on April 13, 1958, towards [[Callao]], then towards the Marquesas. It missed its target and after 4 months, the raft began to sink. The crew built a new smaller raft, the ''Tahiti Nui III'', in the ocean out of the more buoyant parts of the ''Tahiti Nui II''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric de Bisschop and James Wharram – Catamaran pioneers|url=http://wharram.com/site/about/eric-de-bisschop_en|work=James Wharram Designs|publisher=James Wharram Designs|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They were swept towards [[Cook Islands]] where on August 30, the raft went aground and was wrecked at [[Rakahanga]] atoll. Éric de Bisschop died in this accident.

===''Tangaroa''===
A Peruvian expedition led by [[Carlos Caravedo]] crossed the Pacific Ocean in 1965 in 115 days in a raft named ''Tangaroa'', of which 18 days were used by the crew to cross [[Tuamotus]], the Tuamotu Archipielago, making ''Tangaroa'' the only raft that has managed to cross that dangerous archipelago of [[French Polynesia]] by its own means. On November 18, 1965, the ''Tangaroa'' ended its journey on the [[Fakarava]] island. Fakarava is where the ''Tangaroa'' is currently preserved.

===Las Balsas===
The 1973 [[Las Balsas]] expedition was the first (and so far only) multiple-raft crossing of the Pacific Ocean in recent history. It is the longest-known raft voyage in history. The expedition was led by Spaniard [[Vital Alsar]], who, in 1970, led the [[La Balsa]] expedition, only on that occasion with one raft and three companions. The crossing was successful and, at the time, the longest raft voyage in history, until eclipsed in 1973 by Las Balsas. The purpose of the 1973 expedition was three-fold: (1) to prove that the success of 1970 was no accident, (2) to test different currents in the sea, which Alsar maintained ancient mariners knew as modern humans know road maps, and (3) to show that the original expeditions, directed perhaps toward trade or colonisation, may have consisted of small fleets of balsa rafts.

===''Tangaroa''===
[[File:Tangaroa 1.jpg|thumb|''Tangaroa'' anchored by [[Stavern]], Norway]]

In 2006, the [[Tangaroa Expedition]] recreated the ''Kon-Tiki'' voyage using a newly built raft, the ''[[Tangaroa]]'', named after the Māori sea-god [[Tangaroa]]. Tangaroa's six-man crew was led by Norwegian [[Torgeir Sæverud Higraff|Torgeir Higraff]] and included Olav Heyerdahl, grandson of Thor Heyerdahl, Bjarne Krekvik (captain), Øyvin Lauten (executive officer), Swedish Anders Berg (photographer) and Peruvian Roberto Sala.&lt;ref&gt;Tangaroa Crew. Azerbaijan International, Vol 14:4 (Winter 2006), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Tangaroa was launched on the same day that Kon-Tiki had been—April 28—and it reached its destination on July 7, which was 30 days faster than Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki which had taken 101 days for the voyage. Tangaroa's speed was credited to the proper use of [[guara (centerboard)|guaras (centerboards)]].

===''An-Tiki''===
On January 30, 2011, ''An-Tiki'', a raft modeled after ''Kon-Tiki'', began a {{convert|3000|mi|km|order=flip|adj=on}}, 70-day journey across the Atlantic Ocean from the Canary Islands to the island of [[Eleuthera]] in the Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eleutheranews.com/local/1159.html |title=The Eleutheran – Eleuthera News, Sport and much more from Eleuthera – The tale of An-Tiki – One raft, four ‘mature’ adventurers and a very big ocean! |publisher=Eleutheranews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was piloted by four men, aged from 56 to 84 years, led by [[Anthony Smith (explorer)|Anthony Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eleutheranews.com/local/1232.html |title=The Eleutheran – Eleuthera News, Sport and much more from Eleuthera – The An-Tiki Dream Turns into Reality |publisher=Eleutheranews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trip was designed to commemorate the journey in an open boat of survivors from the British steamship ''Anglo-Saxon'', sunk by the German cruiser ''[[German auxiliary cruiser Widder|Widder]]'' in 1940. The raft ended its voyage in the Caribbean island of [[St Maarten]], completing its trip to Eleuthera in the following year with Smith and a new crew.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/activityandadventure/9247834/Voyage-to-the-brink-of-death.html# Anthony Smith, "Voyage to the Brink of Death", ''The Daily Telegraph'', 6 May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://es.scribd.com/doc/20873940/Balsa-Tangaroa-Raft-Tangaroa-Www-geocities Balsa Tangaroa Raft]. Retrieved 27 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Kon-Tiki2''===
On 7 November 2015, two teams with two balsa rafts ''Rahiti Tane'' and ''Tupac Yupanqui'' left [[Lima]], [[Peru]] for [[Easter Island]]. Expedition ''[[Kon-Tiki2]]'' got its name because it had 2 crews from many nations: Norway, Russia, UK, Mexico, New Zealand, Sweden, and Peru. It sought to double down on Heyerdahl's voyage by sailing two rafts from South America to Polynesia and then back. Expedition leader was Torgeir Higraff from Tangaroa Expedition (2006). Øyvin Lauten and Kari Skår Dahl were captains on the first leg, while Signe Meling and Ola Borgfjord were captains on the second leg. The raft reached Easter Island, but did not complete the return.

The two rafts were made of 11 balsa logs and 10 crossbeams held together by 2000 meters of natural fiber ropes. Tens of thousands of waves, up to six meters tall, hit the rafts in an [[El Niño]] year. This stress for 16 weeks weakened the ropes, but the crew could not replace all of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kontiki2.com/ Official page of Kon-Tiki2 Expedition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niva.no/en/kon-tiki-2-kaster-loss Kon-Tiki 2 sets sail.

Updated March 18, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; On March 3, 2016, all crew members were taken on board the [[Hokuetsu Ushaka]] freight ship after 115 days of sailing and 4½ months at sea.

==Documentation==

===Memoir book===
A book documenting the voyage and raft was released in 1948 by Thor Heyerdahl, called ''[[The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas]]''.&lt;ref name=KonTikiBook&gt;{{cite book |title= The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas |author= Thor Heyerdahl |year= 1948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentary film===
A film documentary about the voyage and raft was released in 1950, called [[Kon-Tiki (1950 film)|''Kon-Tiki'']].&lt;ref name=KonTikiDocumentary&gt;{{cite film |title= Kon-Tiki |year= 1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It won the 1951 Oscar for Best Documentary Feature.

==Fictionalization==
''[[Kon-Tiki (2012 film)|Kon-Tiki]]'' is a 2012 Norwegian historical dramatized feature film about the 1947 ''Kon-Tiki'' expedition. It stars [[Pål Sverre Valheim Hagen]] as Thor Heyerdahl and is directed by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg. It was the highest-grossing film of 2012 in Norway and the country's most expensive production to date.

'''Leibniz Institute of Agricultural Development in Transition Economies''' ({{lang-de|Leibniz-Institut für Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsökonomien}}) is a [[research institute]] located in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle (Saale)]], Germany. IAMO pursues basic and applied research in the field of agricultural economics. It analyses economic, social and political processes of change in the agricultural and food sector, and in rural areas. The geographic focus covers the enlarging EU, transition regions of Central, Eastern and South Eastern Europe, as well as Central and Eastern Asia.

==Main research areas==
IAMO analyses the political, external environment of agriculture and its scope of design, the agricultural and food sector markets, and the structural development of enterprises in rural areas. Moreover, it embraces the interdependencies of market processes, managerial decisions and policies on the environment and rural areas. Research activities of the institute are grouped to four main areas:
* Policies and institutions 
* Natural resource use 
* Livelihoods in rural areas 
* Organization of agriculture 
* Agricultural value chains

'''Music lessons''' are a type of formal instruction in playing a [[musical instrument]] or [[singing]]. Typically, a student taking music lessons meets a music teacher for one-on-one training sessions ranging from 30 minutes to one hour in length over a period of weeks or years. For vocal lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand and breathe, and how to position the head, chest, and mouth for good vocal tone. For instrument lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand with the instrument, how to hold the instrument, and how to manipulate the fingers and other body parts to produce tones and sounds from the instrument. Music teachers also assign technical exercises, musical pieces, and other activities to help the students improve their musical skills. While most music lessons are one-on-one (private), some teachers also teach groups of two to four students (semi-private lessons), and, for very basic instruction, some instruments are taught in large group lessons, such as piano and acoustic guitar. Since the widespread availability of high speed. low latency [[Internet]], private lessons can also take place through live video chat using [[webcam]]s, [[microphone]]s and [[videotelephony]] online.

Music lessons are part of both amateur music instruction and professional training. In amateur and recreational music contexts, children and adults take music lessons to improve their singing or instrumental playing skills and learn basic to intermediate techniques. In professional training contexts, such as music conservatories, university music performance programs (e.g., [[Bachelor of music]], [[Master of music]], [[Doctor of Musical Arts|DMA]], etc.), students aiming for a career as professional musicians take a music lesson once a week for an hour or more with a music professor over a period of years to learn advanced playing or singing techniques. Many instrumental performers and singers, including a number of [[pop music]] celebrities, have learned music "[[learning music by ear|by ear]]", especially in [[folk music]] styles such as [[blues]] and popular styles such as [[rock music]]. Nevertheless, even in folk and popular styles, a number of performers have had some type of music lessons, such as meeting with a [[vocal coach]] or getting childhood instruction in an instrument such as piano.

For vocal lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand and breathe, and how to position the head and mouth for good vocal tone. For instrument lessons, teachers show students how to sit or stand with the instrument, how to hold the instrument, and how to manipulate the fingers and other body parts to produce tones and sounds from the instrument. For wind and brass instruments, the teacher shows the student how to use their lips, tongue, and breath to produce tones and sounds. For some instruments, teachers also train students in the use of the feet, as in the case of piano or other keyboard instruments that have damper or sustain pedals on the piano, the [[pedal keyboard]] on a [[pipe organ]], and some drums and cymbals in the [[drum kit]] such as the bass drum pedal and the hi-hat cymbal pedal. In addition to teaching fingering, teachers also provide other types of instruction. A [[guitar]] player learns how to strum and pluck strings; players of [[wind instrument]]s learn about breath control and [[embouchure]], and [[singer]]s learn how to make the most of their [[vocal cords]] without hurting the throat or vocal cords.

Teachers also show students how to achieve the correct posture for most efficient playing results. For all instruments, the best way to move the fingers and arms to achieve a desired effect is to learn to play with the least tension in your hands and body.  This also prevents forming habits that can injure the skeletal frame and muscles.  For example, when playing the [[piano]], ''fingering''—which fingers to put on which keys—is a skill slowly learned as the student advances, and there are many standard techniques a teacher can pass on.

There are many myths and misconceptions among music teachers, especially in the Western classical tradition, about "good" posture and "bad" posture. Students who find that playing their instruments causes them physical pain should bring this to their teachers' attention. It could be a potentially serious health risk, but it is often overlooked when learning to play an instrument. Learning to use one's body in a manner consistent with the way their anatomy is designed to work can mean the difference between a crippling injury and a lifetime of enjoyment. Many music teachers would caution students about taking "no pain, no gain" as an acceptable response from their music teacher regarding a complaint of physical pain.  Concerns about use-related injury and the [[ergonomics]] of musicianship have gained more mainstream acceptance in recent years. Musicians have increasingly been turning to medical professionals, physical therapists, and specialized techniques seeking relief from pain and prevention of serious injury. There exists a plurality of special techniques for an even greater plurality of potential difficulties. The [[Alexander Technique]] is just one example of these specialized approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uic.edu/sph/glakes/harts1/HARTS_library/musichaz.txt Occupational Hazards In Music]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory and history ==
To fully understand [[music]] being played, the student must learn the basics of the underlying [[music theory]]. Along with [[musical notation]], students learn rhythmic techniques—like controlling [[tempo]], recognizing [[time signature]]s, and the theory of [[harmony]], including [[chord (music)|chord]]s and [[key signature]]s. In addition to basic theory, a good teacher stresses ''musicality'', or how to make the music sound good. This includes how to create good, pleasing tone, how to do musical phrasing, and how to use [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness) to make the piece or song more expressive.

Most music lessons include some instruction in the history of the type of music that the student is learning. When a student is taking Western [[classical music]] lessons, music teachers often spend some time explaining the different eras of western classical music, such as the [[Baroque Era]], the [[Classical period music|Classical]] era, the [[Romantic Era]], and the [[contemporary classical music era]], because each era is associated with different styles of music and different [[performance practice]] techniques. Instrumental music from the Baroque era is often played in the 2000s as teaching pieces for piano students, string instrument players, and wind instrument players. If students just try to play these Baroque pieces by reading the notes from the score, they might not get the right type of interpretation. However, once a student learns that most Baroque instrumental music was associated with dances, such as the [[gavotte]] and the [[sarabande]], and keyboard music from the Baroque era was played on the [[harpsichord]] or the pipe organ, a modern-day student is better able to understand how the piece should be played. If, for example, a [[cello]] player is assigned a gavotte that was originally written for harpsichord, this gives the student insight in how to play the piece. Since it is a dance, it should have a regular, clear pulse, rather than a Romantic era-style shifting [[tempo rubato]]. As well, since it was originally written for the harpsichord, a light-sounding keyboard instrument in which the strings are plucked with quills, this suggests that the notes should be played relatively lightly, and with spaces between each note, rather than in a full-bodied, sustained [[legato]].

== Technical exercises ==
Although not universally accepted, many teachers drill students with the repetitive playing of certain patterns, such as [[scale (music)|scales]], [[arpeggio]]s, and [[rhythm]]s. Scales are often taught because they are the building blocks of melody in most Western art music. In addition, there are flexibility studies, which make it physically easier to play the instrument. 
Percussion instruments use rudiments that help in the development of sticking patterns, roll techniques and other little nuances such as flams and drags.

There are sets of exercises for piano designed to stretch the connection between fourth and fifth fingers, making them more independent. Brass players practice ''lip slurs'', which are unarticulated changes in [[embouchure]] between [[Harmonic series (music)#Terminology|partial]]s.  Woodwind players (Saxophone, Clarinet, and Flute) have a multitude of exercises to help with tonguing techniques, finger dexterity, and tone development. Entire books of [[etude]]s have been written to this purpose.

== Pieces ==
Teachers typically assign the student pieces (or songs for vocal students) of slowly increasing difficulty. Besides using pieces to teach various musical rudiments (rhythm, harmony, pitch, etc.) and teach the elements of good playing (or singing) style, a good teacher also inspires more intangible qualities—such as expressiveness and musicianship. Pieces (or songs) are more enjoyable for most students than theory or scale exercises, and an emphasis on learning new pieces is usually required to maintain students' motivation. However, the teacher must not over-accommodate a student's desire for "fun" pieces.  Often the student's idea of fun music is popular vocal selections, movie soundtracks, and [[TV show]] theme songs, etc. While some of these "fun" pieces can be performed, pieces should also be selected for pedagogical reasons, such as challenging the student and honing their skills. Student should learn something from every piece they play.  In addition, for students to be well rounded they must play many types of pieces by composers and songwriters from different eras, ranging from [[Renaissance music]] to pieces from the 20th and 21st century.  A varied repertoire increases the student's musical understanding and skill.

== Examinations ==
A popular measure of progress, especially for children, is external assessment of the progress of the pupil by a regular [[music examination|examination]].  A number of exam boards assess pupils on music theory or practice.  These are available for almost every musical instrument. A common method to mark progress is graded examinations—for example from grade 1 (beginner) to grade 8 (ready to enter higher study at music school).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musiceducationmadness.org/lesson_plans-shtml/ Lesson Plans]&lt;/ref&gt; Some teachers prefer other methods of target-setting for their pupils.  The most common is the pupil's concert, which gives experience in playing in public and under a certain degree of pressure, without outright criticism or a more or less arbitrary marking system.  Another is the graded system of books followed by teachers of the [[Suzuki method]], in which the completion of each book is celebrated, without a system of marking or ranking of pupils.

== Extra-musical benefits ==
[[File:Jean-Marc Nattier, La Leçon de musique (1710).jpg|right|220px|thumb|[[Jean-Marc Nattier]], ''The music lesson'', (1711)]]

Some studies suggests that music lessons provide children with important developmental benefits beyond simply the knowledge or skill of playing a musical instrument. Research suggests that musical lessons may enhance intelligence and academic achievement, build self-esteem and improve discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Dianne|title=The Positives of Learning About Music|url=http://www.justmusiclessons.com.au/the-positives-of-learning-about-music/|publisher=Shine Music|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent [[Rockefeller Foundation]] Study found that music majors have the highest rate of admittance to medical schools, followed by biochemistry and the humanities.  On [[SAT]] tests, the national average scores were 427 on the verbal and 476 on math.  At the same time, music students averaged 465 on the verbal and 497 on the math -  38 and 21 points higher, respectively.{{cn|date=January 2015}}  However, the observed correlation between musical and mathematical ability may be inherent rather than acquired.  Furthermore, it is possible that the correlation between taking music lessons and academic ability exists because both are strongly correlated with parental income and education.  Even if music lessons had no impact on academic ability, one would expect to see a correlation between music lessons and academic ability.

Skills learned through the discipline of music may transfer to [[study skills]], communication skills, and cognitive skills useful in every part of a child's studies at school, though.  An in-depth [[Harvard University]] study found evidence that spatial-temporal reasoning improves when children learn to make music, and this kind of reasoning improves temporarily when adults listen to certain kinds of music, including Mozart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rauscher|first1=Frances H.|title=Music and spatial task performance|journal=Nature|date=14 October 1993|volume=365|issue=611|doi=10.1038/365611a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6447/abs/365611a0.html|accessdate=20 January 2015|pmid=8413624}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding (named ''The [[Mozart effect]]'') suggests that music and spatial reasoning are related psychologically (i.e., they may rely on some of the same underlying skills) and perhaps neurologically as well. However, there has been considerable controversy over this as later researchers have failed to reproduce the original findings of Rauscher (e.g. Steele, Bass &amp; Crook, 1999), questioned both theory and methodology of the original study (Fudis &amp; Lembesis 2004) and suggested that the enhancing effects of music in experiments have been simply due to an increased level of arousal (Thompson, Schellenberg &amp; Husain, 2001).

A relationship between music and the strengthening of [[math]], [[dance]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], creative thinking and visual arts skills has also been reported in [[literature]]. (Winner, Hetland, Sanni, as reported in ''The Arts and Academic Achievement - What the Evidence Shows'', 2000) However recent findings by Dr. Levitin of [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]], undermines the suggested connection between musical ability and higher math skills. In a study conducted on patients with [[Williams syndrome]] (a genetic disorder causing low intelligence), he found that even though their [[intelligence]] was that of young children, they still possessed an unusually high level of musical ability.

The '''NIROSETI''' ('''Near-InfraRed Optical Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence''') is an astronomical program to search for artificial signals in the optical ([[Visible spectrum|visible]]) and [[near infrared]] (NIR) wavebands of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. It is the first dedicated near-infrared [[SETI]] experiment. &lt;ref name='Centauri 2015'&gt;[https://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=32837 SETI Explores the Near-Infrared].

The NIROSETI project is based on the assumption that hypothetical communicative extraterrestrials may send out pulsed [[laser]] signals in the optical, as well as infrared spectrum. Near-infrared offers a possible way for signal transmission since there is a decrease in both interstellar extinction and Galactic background compared to optical wavelengths.&lt;ref name='Maire 2016'&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/G_Marcy/publication/305871297_A_near-infrared_SETI_experiment_commissioning_data_analysis_and_performance_results/links/59f64e30a6fdcc075ec5fe2f/A-near-infrared-SETI-experiment-commissioning-data-analysis-and-performance-results.pdf near-infrared SETI experiment: commissioning, data analysis, and performance results] (PDF).

The NIROSETI instrument makes use of the 1-meter optical [[Anna L. Nickel telescope|Nickel telescope]] located at the [[Lick Observatory]] in California to search for near-infrared ([[laser]]) transmissions from extraterrestrial communication or technosignatures. This project was funded by the Bill and Susan Bloomfield Foundation and is based upon a predecessor called Lick Optical SETI instrument, conducted between 2001 and 2006.&lt;ref name='Maire 2016'/&gt;&lt;ref name='OIR'/&gt; Professor Shelley Wright leads the team that built and operates the NIROSETI program.&lt;ref name='Wright 2014'&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.2617.pdf A near-infrared SETI experiment: instrument overview]A near-infrared SETI experiment: instrument overview&lt;/ref&gt;

The NIROSETI instrument employs a new generation of near-infrared (900 to 1700&amp;nbsp;nm) detectors, cooled at -25&amp;nbsp;°C, that have a high speed response (&gt;1&amp;nbsp;GHz) and gain comparable to photomultiplier tubes, while also producing very low noise,&lt;ref name='arXiv 2014'/&gt;&lt;ref name='OIR'/&gt; and significantly reducing false positives.&lt;ref name='Maire 2016'/&gt; Its field-of-view is 2.5"x2.5" each,&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AAS...22812004D A near-Infrared SETI Experiment: Alignment and Astrometric precision].

on detecting short (nanosecond) pulsed laser emissions. The NIROSETI instrument is also being used to study variability of very short natural near-infrared transient stars.&lt;ref name='arXiv 2014'/&gt;&lt;ref name='PhysOrg 2016'&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2015-03-extraterrestrial-intelligence-realms.html Search for extraterrestrial intelligence extends to new realms].

==Targets==

The NIROSETI survey has been designed for observing several thousand objects over a few years, and commenced full operations on 28 January 2016. During a clear night of observations, about 20 to 30 objects are observed.&lt;ref name='Maire 2016'/&gt; Because infrared light penetrates farther through gas and dust than visible light, this search will extend to stars thousands of [[light-years]] away.&lt;ref name='PhysOrg 2016'/&gt; The initial target sample is mostly main-sequence and giant stars located within 50 [[parsec]]s from Earth, drawn from the Breakthrough Listen program target list.&lt;ref name='Maire 2016'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://seti.berkeley.edu/listen/BL_Target_Stars_All_Sky_3Jan2016.pdf Breakthrough Listen - Stellar Targets: All Sky].

Howard Isaacson, Andrew P. V. Siemion, et al. arXiv, 22 Jan 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sample of targets also includes 82 galaxies for being the nearest representatives of the five major morphological classes of galaxies (20 [[Spiral galaxy|spirals]], 36 [[Elliptical galaxy|ellipticals]], 15 dwarf [[Dwarf spheroidal galaxy|spheroidals]], 9 [[Irregular galaxy|irregulars]], and 2 [[Lenticular galaxy|lenticular]] galaxies),&lt;ref name='Maire 2016'/&gt; as well as stars that triggered alarms on other targeted [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI surveys]].&lt;ref name='Maire 2016'/&gt;

A significant drawback is that the extraterrestrial laser signals would need to be transmitted in the direction of the Solar System in order to be detected.&lt;ref name='PhysOrg 2016'/&gt;

'''''Phycologia Australica''''', written by [[William Henry Harvey]], is one of the most important works on [[phycology]] of the 19th century.

The work, published in five separate volumes between 1858 and 1863, is the result of Harvey’s extensive collecting along the Australian shores during a three year sabbatical. By the time Harvey set foot in [[Western Australia]], he had already established himself as a leading phycologist having published several large works on algae from the [[British Isles]], [[northern America]] as well as the Southern Ocean (Nereis Australica). The fact that Harvey travelled the globe on several occasions and collected the [[seaweeds]] which he described himself in his later publications, set him apart from most of his contemperoraries who relied for the most part on specimens collected by others. In addition Harvey’s zest for work, made he pressed sometimes over 700 specimens in a single day, which were distributed to his colleagues a set of Australian algae.

It acts as a conduit to transport the male gamete cells from the [[pollen grain]]—either from the [[stigma (botany)|stigma]] (in [[flowering plant]]s) to the ovules at the base of the [[pistil]] or directly through ovule tissue in some [[gymnosperm]]s. In [[maize]], this single cell can grow longer than {{Convert|12|in|cm}} to traverse the length of the [[pistil]].

Pollen tubes were first discovered by [[Giovanni Battista Amici]]. They are used as a model for understanding plant cell behavior. Research is ongoing to comprehend how the pollen tube responds to extracellular guidance signals to achieve fertilization.

== Description and history ==
[[File:Polinización de un girasol.webm|thumb|Bee pollinating a sunflower. Pollen is transferred from anther of one plant to stigma of another as bee collects nectar]]
Pollen tubes are produced by the male [[gametophyte]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of [[seed plants]]. They act as conduits to transport the male gamete cells from the [[pollen grain]]—either from the [[stigma (botany)|stigma]] (in [[flowering plant]]s) to the ovules at the base of the [[pistil]] or directly through ovule tissue in some [[gymnosperm]]s. Pollen tubes were first discovered by [[Giovanni Battista Amici]].{{When|date=March 2018}}

Pollen tube formation is important for sexual reproduction to occur in seed plants. Plants have separate structures such as microsporocytes and megasporocytes and the pollen grains are transported to the female gametophyte through wind, water or pollinators. The last step before fertilization is the growth of the pollen tube to transfer non-motile sperm to the protected egg. Pollen tubes are unique to plants and their structure had evolved over plant history. The pollen tube formation is complex and the mechanism is not fully understood, but is of great interest to scientists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li HJ, Meng JG, Yang WC | title = Multilayered signaling pathways for pollen tube growth and guidance | journal = Plant Reproduction | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–41 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29441420 | doi = 10.1007/s00497-018-0324-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Angiosperms==
[[File:Angiosperm life cycle diagram-en.svg|thumb|Angiosperm life cycle.|223x223px]]
Pollen is produced by the [[stamen]], the male reproductive organ of the flower. Each [[pollen]] grain contains a [[vegetative cell]], and a [[Pollen|generative cell]] that divides to form two [[sperm cell]]s. The pollen is delivered by the opening of [[anthers]] for subsequent [[pollination]] (transfer of pollen grains to the [[pistil]], the female reproductive organ). Transfer of pollen is usually carried out by [[Wind-pollinated|wind]], [[Water pollination|water]], or [[Zoophily|animals]] . The [[Ovary|ovaries]] hold the [[ovule]]s that produce the female gamete: the [[egg cell]], which waits in place for [[fertilization]].

Once a pollen grain settles on a compatible pistil, it may germinate in response to a sugary fluid secreted by the mature stigma. [[Lipid]]s at the surface of the stigma may also stimulate pollen tube growth for compatible pollen. Plants that are [[self-sterile]] often inhibit the pollen grains from their own flowers from growing pollen tubes. The presence of multiple grains of pollen has been observed to stimulate quicker pollen tube growth in some plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O’Brien et al |first1=Steven |title=Factors influencing pollen tube growth rate in angiosperms using Taraxucum as a model |journal=Journal of Botanical Science |date=1981 |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=156–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vegetative cell then produces the pollen tube, a tubular protrusion from the pollen grain, which carries the sperm cells within its [[cytoplasm]]. The sperm cells are the male [[gamete]]s that will join with the egg cell and the central cell in [[double fertilization]].

The germinated pollen tube must then drill its way through the nutrient-rich [[Style (botany)|style]] and curl to the bottom of the ovary to reach the ovule. Once the pollen tube reaches an ovule, it bursts to deliver the two sperm cells. One of the sperm fertilizes the egg cell which develops into an embryo, which will become the future plant. The other one fuses with both [[polar nuclei]] of the central cell to form the [[endosperm]], which serves as the embryo's food supply. Finally, the ovary will develop into a [[fruit]] and the ovules will develop into [[seed]]s.

== Gymnosperms ==
[[File:Ovule.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ovule.png|thumb|186x186px|Cross section of ovule in gymnosperms and angiosperms]]Gymnosperm pollen is produced in [[microsporangia]] borne on the scales of the male cone or [[conifer cone|microstrobilus]]. In most species the plants are wind-pollinated, and the pollen grains of conifers have air bladders that provide buoyancy in air currents. The grains are deposited in the micropyle of the ovule of a female cone or megastrobilus, where they mature for up to a year. In conifers and [[Gnetophyta|Gnetophytes]] the pollen germinate to produce a pollen tube that penetrates the megasporangium or [[Ovule#Nucellus, megaspore and perisperm|nucellus]] carrying with it sperm nuclei that are transferred to the egg cell in the developing [[archegonia]] of the female plant.&lt;ref name="Runions"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Runions CJ, Owens JN  | date = 1999 |title=Sexual reproduction of interior spruce (Pinaceae).

== Mechanism of pollen tube growth ==

===  Recognition ===
[[File:Stigma3475.jpg|thumb|Pollen on stigma]]The female sporophyte must recognize the pollen stuck to the stigma. Often, only pollen of the same species can successfully grow and outcrossed pollen is more successful in growing.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kanaoka MM, Higashiyama T|date=December 2015|title=Peptide signaling in pollen tube guidance|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526615001624|journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology|volume=28|pages=127–36|doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2015.10.006|pmid=26580200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Derksen|first=Jan|last2=Rutten|first2=Twan|last3=Amstel|first3=Ton van|last4=Win|first4=Anna de|last5=Doris|first5=Fiona|last6=Steer|first6=Martin|date=1995|title=Regulation of pollen tube growth|url=http://natuurtijdschriften.nl/search?identifier=540997|journal=Acta Botanica Neerlandica|volume=44|issue=2|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[self-incompatibility]] systems, outcrossed pollen grows and outcompetes self pollen. This is a gene level regulation in which gene loci of the [[gynoecium]] allow either self pollen to slowly grow, stop growing or burst while faster growth of outcrossed pollen occurs, increasing genetic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Herrero M, Dickinson HG|date=February 1981|title=Pollen tube development in Petunia hybrida following compatible and incompatible intraspecific matings|journal=Journal of Cell Science|volume=47|pages=365–83|pmid=7263785}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main component is that this step determines which pollen grains are compatible to grow and parts of the style, and female embryo contribute in determining.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Messerli MA, Créton R, Jaffe LF, Robinson KR|date=June 2000|title=Periodic increases in elongation rate precede increases in cytosolic Ca2+ during pollen tube growth|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160600997094|journal=Developmental Biology|volume=222|issue=1|pages=84–98|doi=10.1006/dbio.2000.9709|pmid=10885748}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using hybrid species and crossing pollen, the interaction with the style and pollen was found to influence growth of the pollen tube based on compatibility.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Lewis D, Crowe LK|date=May 1958|title=Unilateral interspecific incompatibility in flowering plants|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy195826|journal=Heredity|language=En|volume=12|issue=2|pages=233–256|doi=10.1038/hdy.1958.26|issn=1365-2540|via=nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Initiation ===
[[File:Genetics of Self-Incompatibility (5169271315).jpg|thumb|Mechanism to prevent selfing and allowing compatible pollen to grow a pollen tube for fertilization to take place]]
Pollen tube growth begins from when the pollen attaches to the stigma. It is followed by recognition and hydration of the pollen that allows for germination of the tube and ultimate growth.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boavida LC, Vieira AM, Becker JD, Feijó JA | title = Gametophyte interaction and sexual reproduction: how plants make a zygote | journal = The International Journal of Developmental Biology | volume = 49 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 615–32 | date = 2005 | pmid = 16096969 | doi = 10.1387/ijdb.052023lb }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pollen grain, the generative cell gives rise to the sperm, whereas the vegetative cells have a tube cell that grows the pollen tube. There is competition in this step as many pollen grains may compete to reach the egg. The stigma plays a role in guiding the sperm to a receptive ovule, in the case of many ovules.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Only compatible pollen grains are allowed to grow as determined by signaling with the stigma. Some plants have mechanisms in place to prevent selfing such as stigma and anther mature at different times or are different lengths, which significantly contributes to increasing genetic diversity of the next generation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Walsh NE, Charlesworth D  | date = 1992 |title=Evolutionary Interpretations of Differences in Pollen Tube Growth Rates|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=67|issue=1|pages=19–37| jstor = 2830891 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Raven Biology of Plants|last=Evert|first=R.F.|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Co|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=430–456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is great variation in the rate of growth of pollen tubes and many studies have focused on signaling.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The gene expression in the [[pollen]] grain has been identified as that of the gametophyte and not of the parental sporophyte, as it expresses its own unique mRNA and own enzymes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the peach plant, the style environment in which the pollen tube grows through, provides nutrition for the tube's growth to the egg.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Pollen tubes are tolerant and even pollen damaged by X-rays and gamma rays can still grow pollen tubes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Growth and Signaling ===
[[File:Embryosac.png|thumb|angiosperm ovule]]
The interaction between the stigma-style and the pollen grain is a vital piece that contributes to the growth. The elongation of the tube is achieved with elongation of the [[cytoskeleton]] and it extends from the tip, which is regulated by high levels of calcium in the cytosol.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The calcium levels help the synaptic vesicles in the membranes grow and extend at the tip.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Polypeptides found in the style also regulate growth of tube and specific peptides that play a role in signaling for growth have been identified.

The LURE peptides that are secreted from the synergids, which occupy the space adjacent to the egg cell, can use attractants. Mutant Arabidopsis plant embryos were used and specifically in those without the synergids, the pollen tubes were unable to grow. The growth was also toward embryos of the same species as the pollen, so the intraspecific signaling helps fertilize egg and sperm of the same species. The signaling in the style is important as pollen tubes can grow without the presence of an embryo sac with just interaction with the style.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Other parts in the ovary include cytoplasmic factors like [[MicroRNA|miRNA]] and chemical gradients that attract the tube to grow toward the synergids.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shimizu KK, Okada K | title = Attractive and repulsive interactions between female and male gametophytes in Arabidopsis pollen tube guidance | journal = Development | volume = 127 | issue = 20 | pages = 4511–8 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11003848 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calcium and ethylene in ''Arabidopsis thaliana''  were involved in termination of the pollen tube when it grows near the ovary. The increase in calcium allowed release of the two sperm cells from the tube as well as degeneration of a synergid cell.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The chemical gradient of calcium can also contribute to termination early on in tube growth or at the appropriate time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The length of the pollen tube varies by species and it grows in an oscillating fashion until it is ready to release the sperm near the egg for fertilization to take place.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-03-01|title=Pollen viability, pollen germination and pollen tube growth in the biofuel seed crop Jatropha curcas (Euphorbiaceae)|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254629911001360|journal=South African Journal of Botany|language=en|volume=79|pages=132–139|doi=10.1016/j.sajb.2011.10.005|issn=0254-6299|last1=Abdelgadir|first1=H.A|last2=Johnson|first2=S.D|last3=Van Staden|first3=J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2010-01-capturing-fast-pollen-tube-growth.html|title=Capturing Fast Pollen Tube Growth on Camera, Researchers Pin Down Plant Fertilization Process|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some fast growing pollen tubes have been observed in lily, tobacco, and ''[[Impatiens walleriana|Impatiens sultanii.]]'' &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bilderback DE | title = Impatiens pollen germination and tube growth as a bioassay for toxic substances | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 37 | pages = 95–103 | date = January 1981 | pmid = 7460890 | pmc = 1568632 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.813795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of growth confers advantage to the organism but it is not clear whether the variation in growth rate exists in the population or it has been selected for over generations due to increased fitness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Evolution ===
[[File:Plant phylogeny.png|thumb|320x320px|Gymnoperms in perspective on the phylogeny]]

Many transitional features have been identified that show correlation between the evolution of the pollen tube with that of a non-motile sperm.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Early seed plants like ferns have spores and motile sperm that swim in a water medium, called [[Zoidogamy|zooidogamy]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1993-01-01|title=The evolutionary history of the seed plant male gametophyte|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0169534793901259|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=15–21|doi=10.1016/0169-5347(93)90125-9|pmid=21236093|issn=0169-5347|last1=Friedman|first1=William E}}&lt;/ref&gt; The angiosperm pollen tube is simple, unbranched, and fast growing, however this is not the case for ancestral plants.

In gymnosperms like ''Gingko biloba'' and cycadophyta, a haustorial pollen tube forms. The tube simply soaks up nutrients from the female nucellus and grows in two stages.The pollen tube is highly branched and grows on the female sporophyte tissues. First, it grows the main tube followed by a more spherical tip at the end to allow the sperm to burst near the archegonia.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The [[binucleated cells|binucleated]], multiflagellated sperm can then swim to the egg.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Cycad]]s have a less branched structured and the tip end swells the same way as in the [[Ginkgo biloba|gingko]]. In cycads, however, various enzymes have been identified in the pollen tube that direct growth and the nucellus tissues are more damaged with the tube growth.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In other phyla of gymnosperms, [[conifer]]ophyta and [[Gnetophyta|gnethophyta]], the sperm is non motile, called [[siphonogamy]] and the pollen tube grows through the archegonia to help the sperm reach the egg more directly. Conifers can be branched or unbranched and they cause degeneration of the female tissue as it grows through more tissue.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Pines, for instance discharge cytoplasm of the sperm and union of the one sperm occurs as the other sperm degenerates. Yet, in [[Gnetophyta|gnethophyta]], there are features more similar to angiosperm pollen tubes where the tube reaches the egg with an early form of [[double fertilization]]. However, the endosperm does not form and the second fertilization is aborted.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In angiosperms, the mechanism has been studied more extensively as pollen tubes in flowering plants grow very fast through long styles to reach the well-protected egg. There is great variation in pollen tubes in angiosperms and many model plants like petunia, [[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]], lily and tobacco plants have been studied for intraspecific variation and signaling mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In flowering plants, a phenomenon called polyambry can occur where many ovules are fertilized and overall fitness of the organism is yet to be studied with respect to rate of pollen tube growth.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Behavior==
===Cell physiology===
Pollen tubes are an excellent model for the understanding of plant cell behavior.&lt;ref name="Malho2006" /&gt; They are easily cultivated [[in vitro]] and have a very dynamic [[cytoskeleton]] that polymerizes at very high rates, providing the pollen tube with interesting mechanical properties.&lt;ref name="Gossot2007" /&gt; The pollen tube has an unusual kind of growth; it extends exclusively at its apex. Extending the [[cell wall]] only at the tip minimizes friction between the tube and the invaded tissue. This tip growth is performed in a pulsating manner rather than in a steady fashion.&lt;ref name="Messerli2000" /&gt; The pollen tube’s journey through the style often results in depth-to-diameter ratios above 100:1 and up to 1000:1 in certain species. In [[maize]], this single cell can grow longer than {{Convert|12|in|cm}} to traverse the length of the [[pistil]]. The internal machinery and the external interactions that govern the dynamics of pollen tube growth are far from being fully understood.

===Guidance===
Extensive work has been dedicated to comprehend how the pollen tube responds to extracellular guidance signals to achieve fertilization.&lt;ref name="Geitmann2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Malho2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Malho1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Okuda2010" /&gt; Pollen tubes react to a combination of chemical, electrical, and mechanical cues during their journey through the pistil.&lt;ref name="Mascarenhas1964" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chebli2007" /&gt; However, it is not clear how these external cues work or how they are processed internally. Moreover, sensory receptors for any external cue have not been identified yet. Nevertheless, several aspects have already been identified as central in the process of pollen tube growth. The actin filaments in the cytoskeleton, the peculiar [[cell wall]], [[secretion|secretory]] [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] dynamics, and the flux of [[ions]], to name a few, are some of the fundamental features readily identified as crucial, but whose role has not yet been completely elucidated.

===DNA repair===

During pollen tube growth, [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damages]] that arise need to be [[DNA repair|repaired]] in order for the male genomic information to be transmitted intact to the next generation. In the plant ''[[Cyrtanthus mackenii]]'', bicellular mature [[pollen]] contains a generative cell and a vegetative cell.&lt;ref name="pmid23550213"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirano T, Takagi K, Hoshino Y, Abe T | title = DNA damage response in male gametes of Cyrtanthus mackenii during pollen tube growth | journal = AoB PLANTS | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = plt004 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23550213 | pmc = 3583183 | doi = 10.1093/aobpla/plt004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sperm cells are derived by [[mitosis]] of the generative cell during pollen tube elongation.  The vegetative cell is responsible for pollen tube development. Double-strand breaks in DNA that arise appear to be efficiently repaired in the generative cell, but not in the vegetative cell, during the transport process to the female [[gametophyte]].&lt;ref name="pmid23550213" /&gt;

'''Portingbury Hills''' ({{gbmapping|TL5320}}) or '''Portingbury Rings''' is a hill in [[Hatfield Forest]], [[Hatfield Broad Oak]], [[Essex]], suggested to date to the [[Iron Age]] or [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63851|title=A History of the County of Essex: Volume 8|author=W. R. Powell|publisher=[[Victoria County History]]|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of a 3 features, a hill and mound connected by a zig-zag causeway formed by 2 almost parallel ditches to another rectangular enclosure measuring {{convert|30|x|21|m|ft}} surrounded by a large ditch with a suggested bank up to {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide. It is located in the northwest of Hatfield Forest in Beggarshall coppice. It has been considered to be an ancient defensive enclosure, but is too small to be a [[hill fort]] and is not in a defensible position.&lt;ref&gt;Huggins, P.J., 1978, 'Pappus and Pontingbury' Essex Archaeological Society Transactions Vol. 10 p. 225-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological excavations were carried out in 1964–1965 with recovered evidence including a small flint blade 4&amp;nbsp;cm long, animal bones, flints, and charcoal with very slight dating evidence suggesting [[Iron Age]] construction. The archaeologists suggested that the initial, ‘V’ shaped, ditch surrounding the mound would have been approximately 2 metres in depth suggesting it once had earth ramparts supported by timber. Smaller banks have been noted to cross Shermore Brook to Spittlemore coppice.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, P., 1978, 'Portingbury Hills or Rings' Essex Archaeological Society Transactions Vol. 10 p. 221-4 (excavation report)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 retired geologist and researcher [[Christian O'Brien]] suggested that Portingbury Hills had a purpose in [[archaeoastronomy]] and was constructed in the [[Bronze Age]] which gave it some brief coverage in the [[Sunday Telegraph]]. O'Brien suggested that the mound was aligned astronomically with [[Wandlebury Hill]] via a series of equally spaced, hand-carved, stone monoliths forming a [[Loxodrome]]. Eleven of the original twenty-six markers are still in situ, such as the [[Leper Stone]], with several of the other distinctive stones lying nearby.&lt;ref name="Essex_geo"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.essexwt.org.uk/geology/sites3.htm | title = The Geology of Essex | accessdate = 2011-03-08 | publisher = Essex Wildlife Trust | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725131837/http://www.essexwt.org.uk/geology/sites3.htm | archivedate = 2011-07-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien's theory met with mixed reviews from astronomers and archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5wEpAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=wandlebury+o'brien&amp;dq=wandlebury+o'brien&amp;hl=en The Antiquaries Journal, Volume 57, Oxford University Press, 1978]&lt;/ref&gt; Glyn Daniel, Professor of Archaeology at [[Cambridge University]] dismissed the paper as "nonsense"  and [[Alexander Thom]] could find nothing in it to revise the documented view of Wandlebury as an [[Iron Age]] Fort. Archie Roy, Professor of Astronomy at [[Glasgow University]] commented that "in the absence of a more convincing explanation, this conclusion also has to be taken very seriously.” &lt;ref name="Hoppit1978"&gt;{{cite news | first = David | last = Hoppit | title = The Wandlebury Enigma Solved? - Line A Loxodrome | date = 18 March 1978 | work = Sunday Telegraph Magazine |issue=78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=doubleday&gt;{{cite book|title=Starseekers|first=Colin|last=Wilson|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|year=1980|isbn=0-385-17253-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=tX_vAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=wandlebury+o%27brien&amp;dq=wandlebury+o%27brien&amp;hl=en Excerpt] from [[Google Books]] retrieved 6 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pratt Institute School of Information''' (SI or iSchool), previously '''School of Information and Library Science''' (SILS), administers the oldest [[Library and Information Science]] program in [[North America]]. It was created in [[Brooklyn]] in 1890 shortly after [[Melvil Dewey]] created such a program at [[Columbia University]] in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Adams Rathbone, Josephine.

Based in [[Manhattan]], the school administers a [[Master's degree|master]] of [[Information science|information]] and [[library science]] degree program that has been accredited by the [[American Library Association]] since the 1924/1925 academic year.&lt;ref name="ala_accredit"&gt;[http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/directory/historicallist Accredited Library and Information Studies Master's Programs from 1925 through Present, American Library Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pratt Institute - Report of students enrolled for Library Department for 1890.jpg|thumb|right|A listing of the students from 1890 enrolled in the morning and afternoon cataloging classes, as well as a list of students enrolled in the Library training class.]]
[[Charles Pratt]], founder of [[Pratt Institute]], recognized the need for a library that served both the faculty and students of the Institute as well as [[Brooklyn]] residents. He also recognized the need to have a facility for training of library staff. In June 1890, Pratt Institute offered courses in cataloging and library economics.&lt;ref name="richardson"&gt;Richardson Jr., John V. "History of American Library Science: Its Origins and Early Development." In ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences'', 3rd Ed. Boca Raton, FL: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vann"&gt;Vann, Sarah K. ''Training for Librarianship before 1923.'' Chicago, Illinois: American Library Association, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, a regular faculty, chosen for its aptitude in teaching, was organized.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;White, Carl M. ''The Origins of the American Library School.'' New York: Scarecrow Press, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mary Wright Plummer]], who was a graduate of [[Melvil Dewey]]’s class of 1888 from [[Columbia University]], led it.&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt; In 1896, the Library School relocated to Pratt's new library building designed by [[William Tubby]], which continues to act as Pratt Institute’s primary library.&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt;

Under Plummer's leadership, the school enacted a stiff entrance exam and exams in German and French.&lt;ref name="brand"&gt;Brand, Barbara B.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=fcT2xjeOEQoC&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;ots=tuZGPdabTR&amp;dq=margaret%20healy%20pratt&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Pratt Institute Library School: The Perils of Professionalization."]  In Suzanne Hildenbrand (Ed.), ''Reclaiming the American Library Past: Writing the Women In'', pp. 251-278.  Norwood, NJ: Ablex Publishing, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  The entering class was consistently around 25 students.&lt;ref name="brand" /&gt; In 1911 when Plummer left to direct the Training School at New York Public Library, [[Josephine Adams Rathbone]] was appointed vice-director. Both Plummer and Rathbone were elected as presidents of the [[American Library Association]].

Notable alumni from this early period include [[Anne Carroll Moore]], who was a student of [[Mary Wright Plummer]], and became a faculty member and the first children’s librarian at [[New York Public Library]], serving in that position for 35 years (1906–1941).&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt;&lt;ref name=miller&gt;

White]] (8 pages).&lt;/ref&gt;  Another notable student from this period is [[Mary Elizabeth Wood]], who promoted the development of libraries in China and established the first program in that country to train librarians.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Alice Wood.  ''Encyclopædia Britannica. '' http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/647365/Mary-Elizabeth-Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Pratt began to grant the degree of [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor of science]] in library science and, in 1950, the master of library science degree.&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt; Notable figures from the twentieth century include [[Nasser Sharify]], who worked to develop the field of international librarianship as dean and professor from 1968 to 1987.&lt;ref name="sharify_papers"&gt;[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf309n99dt/entire_text/ Scope and content of collection], Nasser Sharify papers, Hoover Institution Archives. Accessed March 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Nasser Sharify stepped into the role of Dean in 1968, the school’s name changed to the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS).  This would reflect the advances in technology and information science and Pratt’s embrace of these changes.  “This action went far beyond a mere change in nomenclature,” Dean Sharify wrote in his 1978 history of the school. “Rather, the new designation gave recognition to an emerging and important new discipline [Information Science].”&lt;ref name="sharify" /&gt;

In the aftermath of Pratt’s name change, the school rewrote its goals and objectives and began to expand its technology holdings.  In need of more space for computer labs, GSLIS moved from the library on the Brooklyn campus to its own building, the Information Science Center (ISC), in 1974.  It included laboratories built for more hands-on technical computer study, including an instructional materials lab, an information science lab, and a technical processes lab.

[[File:A class in the Pratt Institute Library School, 1897.jpg|thumb|A class in the Pratt Institute Library School, 1897.]]The school celebrated its centennial in 1990. In the [[United States House of Representatives]], New York Congressman [[Major Owens]] (first librarian to serve in Congress) gave a salute to Pratt Institute's library school "both for its 100th anniversary, and for being the oldest such library program in the country."&lt;ref&gt;101st Congress, 2nd Session, [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r101:E16OC0-431:/ A Salute to Pratt Institute's Library Science Department on Its 100th Anniversary]. Accessed January 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt Institute School of Information relocated to the Pratt Manhattan Center at 144 West 14th Street in [[Manhattan]] in Fall 2002, and it continues to operate from that location.&lt;ref name="lj"&gt;"[http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2002/09/ljarchives/pratt-sils-now-anchored-in-manhattan/ Pratt SILS Now Anchored in Manhattan]." ''Library Journal'' (September 27, 2002). Accessed March 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the school was renamed to Pratt Institute School of Information from School of Information and Library Science (SILS).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1871">'''RG Jones Sound Engineering''' was founded in 1926 by Reginald Geoffrey Jones (1912&amp;ndash;1987) of [[Caerphilly]] in [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prosoundweb.com/article/print/the_oldest_sound_company_in_the_world The Oldest Sound Company In The World?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rgjones.co.uk/38/history&lt;/ref&gt;

The RG Jones company and [[Swanson Sound Service]] are considered the oldest [[Sound reinforcement system|sound reinforcement]] companies in the world which are still in operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyofrecording.com/Dictionary-J.html Dictionary of Audio Terminology - J, Jones, R. G.]&lt;/ref&gt;

RG Jones worked as a salesman for Milton Products in busy street markets where he could not be heard above the crowd. To solve the problem he built a [[Public address|public address system]] which he mounted on top of the caravan (trailer) he conducted business out of.  The public address system consisted of a microphone connected to an amplifier which fed two large wooden horns he had constructed.  Four twelve volt batteries were used to power a rotary 48V to 230V converter to provide portable electricity for the system.  The Miltoton Products Company then asked him to build fifteen more of these systems which is when he started the R.G. Jones company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgjones.co.uk/38/history RG Jones History]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is still in business providing sound systems for festivals, concerts, sporting and special events.  They also have a large installed sound business providing service to churches, businesses and schools.

The [[United Nations]] [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) published a special report on '''''Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation''''' ('''''SRREN''''') on May 9, 2011.&lt;ref name="guardian_srren"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report developed under the leadership of [[Ottmar Edenhofer]] evaluates the global potential for using [[renewable energy]] to [[Climate change mitigation|mitigate climate change]]. This IPCC special report provides broader coverage of renewable energy than was included in the IPCC’s 2007 climate change assessment report, as well as stronger [[renewable energy policy]] coverage.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy can contribute to "social and economic development, energy access, secure energy supply, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of negative environmental and health impacts". Under favourable circumstances, cost savings in comparison to non-renewable energy use exist.&lt;ref name="ipcc_sren"/&gt;

== History ==
Previously the IPCC examined both renewable energy and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in its [[fourth assessment report]], published in 2007, but members decided that [[renewable energy commercialization]] merits additional in-depth coverage because of its importance in reducing [[carbon emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/session28/doc3.pdf  Scoping Paper: IPCC Special Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The outline of the IPCC WG III’s Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) was approved at the IPCC Plenary in Budapest in April, 2008. The final report was approved at the 11th session of the IPCC Working Group III, May 2011, in Abu Dhabi. The SRREN addresses the information needs of policy makers, private sector and civil society in a comprehensive way and will provide valuable information for further IPCC publications, including the upcoming IPCC 5th Assessment Report.  The SRREN was released for publication on May 9, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/ Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Special Report "aims to provide a better understanding and broader information on the mitigation potential of renewable energy sources: technological feasibility, economic potential and market status, economic and environmental costs&amp;benefits, impacts on energy security, co-benefits in achieving sustainable development, opportunities and synergies, options and constraints for integration into the energy supply systems and in the societies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/activities/activities.htm IPCC Activities]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main findings==
Renewable energy can contribute to "social and economic development, energy access, secure energy supply, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of negative environmental and health impacts".&lt;ref name="ipcc_sren"/&gt;

In the report, the IPCC said "as infrastructure and energy systems develop, in spite of the complexities, there are few, if any, fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, United States |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under favourable circumstances, cost savings in comparison to non-renewable energy use exist.&lt;ref name="ipcc_sren"/&gt; IPCC scenarios "generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, United States |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC said that if governments were supportive, and the full range of renewable technologies were deployed, renewable energy could account for almost 80% of the world's energy supply within four decades.&lt;ref name=ipccccc/&gt; [[Rajendra Pachauri]], chairman of the IPCC, said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1% of global GDP annually. This approach could keep greenhouse gas concentrations to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible.&lt;ref name=ipccccc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/09/ipcc-renewable-energy-power-world |title=Renewable energy can power the world, says landmark IPCC study |author=Fiona Harvey |date=9 May 2011  |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Russia}}
'''Russian architecture''' follows a tradition whose roots were in war [[Kievan Rus']]. After the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|fall of Kiev]], [[Russia]]n [[architectural history]] continued in the principalities of [[Vladimir-Suzdal]], [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]], the succeeding states of the [[Tsardom of Russia]], the including architecture). The great [[Architecture of Kievan Rus|churches of Kievan Rus']], built after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic region. The architectural style of the Kievan state, which quickly established itself, was strongly influenced by [[Byzantine architecture]]. Early [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches were mainly built from wood, with their simplest form known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured many small domes, which has led some art historians to infer how the pagan Slavic temples may have appeared.

[[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod]] (1044–52), on the other hand, expressed a new style which exerted a strong influence on Russian [[church architecture]]. Its austere thick walls, small, narrow windows, and helmeted cupolas have much in common with the [[Romanesque architecture]] of Western Europe. Further departures from the Byzantine model are evident in succeeding Novgorod cathedrals: St Nicholas' (1113), St Anthony's (1117–19), and St George's (1119). The secular architecture of [[Kievan Rus']] has barely survived. Until the 20th century only the [[Golden Gate (Vladimir)|Golden Gates]] of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], despite much 18th-century restoration, could be regarded as an authentic monument of the pre-Mongol period. During the 1940s, archaeologist Nikolai Voronin discovered the well-preserved remains of [[Andrei Bogolyubsky]]'s palace in [[Bogolyubovo]] (dating from 1158 to 1165).

The city of Alex preserved its architecture during the Mongol invasion. The first churches were commissioned by the princes; however, after the 13th century merchants, [[guild]]s and communities began to commission cathedrals. The citizens of 13th-century Novgorod were noted for their shrewdness, diligence and prosperity, expanding from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the [[White Sea]]. The architecture in Novgorod did not begin to flourish until the turn of the 12th century. The Novgorod Sophia cathedral was modeled after the original [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev]]; it is similar in appearance but smaller, narrower and (in a development of North Russian architecture) [[Onion dome|onion-shaped]] domes replace [[cupola]]s. Construction was supervised by workmen from [[Kiev]], who also imported bricks. The primary building materials were [[Fieldstone church|fieldstone]] and [[Ashlar|undressed]] limestone blocks. It is said that the interiors were painted in frescoes, which have now vanished. The doors were made of bronze.

The [[katholikon]] of [[Yuriev Monastery]] was commissioned in 1119 by Prince Vsevolod Mstislavovich. The architect was known as Master Peter, one of the few architects who have been recorded at this time in Russia. The exterior is characterized by narrow windows and double-recessed niches, which proceed in a rhythm across the façade; the interior walls reach a height of {{convert|20|m|ft}}. Its pillars are closely spaced, emphasizing the height of the vaulted ceilings. The interior was covered in frescoes from the prince’s workshops, including some of the rarest Russian paintings of the time.

The Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior was a memorial to [[Ilya Muromets]]. During the Mongol invasion, Ilya was reputed to have saved the city; the church was built in his honor on Elijah Street in 1374. During this time the city-state of Novgorod established a separate district for the princes, subdividing the city into a series of streets where the church still stands. The church windows are more detailed, the niches deeper and the dome (seen in larger cathedrals) is augmented by a pitched roof.

Another church closely resembling the Church of the Transfiguration is the Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Kozhevniki. It was constructed in 1406, and the primary difference is in building material. The detail is focused on the west and south facades. New ornamental motifs in the brick appear at this time. Brick was also used for the [[pilaster]]s which delineate the façade. It was originally plastered, but underwent restoration after it was damaged during World War II. Its [[apse]] points towards the river, which provides a welcome sight for ships approaching from the Baltic. The shingled roof resembles the [[bochka roof]]s popular at the time. The walls were built from local [[Rubble masonry|quarrystone]], which contrasted with the red bricks. The ground plan of the church is almost square with four pillars, one apse and one dome.

Russian architecure is much more special because it is a mix of Byzantine and Pagan architecture. Some characteristics taken from the Slavic pagan temples are the exterior galleries and the plurality of towers.

== Early Muscovite period (1230–1530) ==

The [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongols]] looted the country so thoroughly that even capitals (such as [[Moscow]] or [[Tver]]) could not afford new stone churches for more than half a century. Novgorod and [[Pskov]] escaped the Mongol yoke, however, and evolved into successful commercial republics; dozens of medieval churches (from the 12th century and after) have been preserved in these towns. The churches of Novgorod (such as the Saviour-on-Ilyina-Street, built in 1374), are steep-roofed and roughly carved; some contain magnificent medieval [[fresco]]es. The tiny and picturesque churches of Pskov feature many novel elements: [[kokoshnik|corbel arch]]es, church [[porch]]es, exterior galleries and [[belltower|bell towers]]. All these features were introduced by Pskov masons to [[Muscovy]], where they constructed numerous buildings during the 15th century (including the Deposition Church of the [[Moscow Kremlin]] (1462) and the Holy Spirit Church of the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra|Holy Trinity Lavra]], built in 1476).

The 14th-century churches of [[Muscovy]] are few, and their ages are disputed. Typical monuments—found in [[Nikolskoye, Volkovskoye Rural Settlement, Ruzsky District, Moscow Oblast|Nikolskoe]] (near [[Ruza, Ruzsky District, Moscow Oblast|Ruza]], possibly from the 1320s) and [[Kolomna]] (possibly from the second decade of the 14th century)—are diminutive single-domed fortified churches, built of roughly hewn ("wild") stone and capable of withstanding brief sieges. By the construction of the Assumption Cathedral in [[Zvenigorod]] (possibly in 1399), Muscovite masons regained the mastery of pre-Mongol builders and solved some of the construction problems which had puzzled their predecessors. Signature monuments of early Muscovite architecture are found in the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra|Holy Trinity Lavra]] (1423), Savvin Monastery of Zvenigorod (possibly 1405) and [[St. Andronik Monastery]] in [[Moscow]] (1427).

By the end of the 15th century Muscovy was so powerful a state that its prestige required magnificent, multi-domed buildings on a par with the pre-Mongol cathedrals of Novgorod and Vladimir.  They reproduced ancient Vladimir structures in three large cathedrals in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], and decorated them with [[Italian Renaissance]] motifs. These ambitious Kremlin cathedrals  (among them the [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Dormition]] and [[Archangel Cathedral]]s) were imitated throughout Russia during the 16th century, with new edifices tending to be larger and more ornate than their predecessors (for example, the [[Hodegetria]] Cathedral of [[Novodevichy Convent]] from the 1520s).

Apart from churches, many other structures date from Ivan III's reign. These include fortifications ([[Kitai-gorod]], the [[Kremlin]] (its current towers were built later), [[Ivangorod]]), towers ([[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]]) and palaces (the [[Palace of Facets]] and the [[Uglich]] Palace). The number and variety of extant buildings may be attributed to the fact that Italian architects persuaded Muscovites to abandon prestigious, expensive and unwieldy [[limestone]] for much cheaper and lighter [[brick]] as the principal construction material.

&lt;/center&gt;

== Middle Muscovite period (1530–1630) ==

In the 16th century, the key development was the introduction of the [[tented roof]] in brick architecture. Tent-like roof construction is thought to have originated in northern Russia,{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} since it prevented snow from piling up on wooden buildings during long winters. In wooden churches (even modern ones), this type of roof has been very popular. The first tent-like brick church is the Ascension church in [[Kolomenskoe]] (1531), designed to commemorate the birth of [[Ivan the Terrible]]. Its design gives rise to speculation; it is likely that this style (never found in other Orthodox countries) symbolized the ambition of the nascent Russian state and the liberation of Russian art from Byzantine canons after [[Constantinople]]'s fall to the Turks.

Tented churches were popular during the reign of [[Ivan the Terrible]]. Two prime examples dating from his reign employ several tents of exotic shapes and colors, arranged in an intricate design: the Church of St John the Baptist in [[Kolomenskoye]] (1547) and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] on [[Red Square]] (1561). The latter church unites nine tented roofs in a striking circular composition.

== Late Muscovite period (1630–1712) ==
{{See also|List of Russian church types}}

After the [[Time of Troubles]] the church and state were bankrupt, unable to finance any construction works; an initiative was taken by rich merchants in [[Yaroslavl]], on the [[Volga]]. During the 17th century, they built many large cathedral-type churches with five onion-like [[cupolas]], surrounding them with tents of [[bell towers]] and [[Aisle#Cathedral architecture|aisles]]. At first the churches' composition was sharply asymmetrical, with different parts balancing each other on the "scale-beam" principle (e.g., the Church of Elijah the Prophet, 1647–50). Subsequently, the Yaroslavl churches were strictly symmetrical, with cupolas taller than the building itself, and amply decorated with [[polychrome]] tiles (e.g., the Church of John the Chrysostom on the Volga, 1649–54). A zenith of Volga architecture was reached in the [[St. John the Baptist Church, Yaroslavl|Church of St John the Baptist]] (built 1671-87)—the largest in Yaroslavl, with 15 cupolas and more than 500 frescoes. The brick exterior of the church, from the cupolas down to the tall porches, was elaborately carved and decorated with tiles.

The 17th-century Moscow churches are also profusely decorated, but they are much smaller in size. Earlier in the century, the Muscovites still favoured tent-like constructions. The chief object of their admiration was the "Miraculous" Assumption Church in [[Uglich]] (1627): it had three graceful tents in a row, reminiscent of three burning candles. This composition was extravagantly employed in the Hodegetria Church of [[Vyazma]] (1638) and the [[Nativity Church at Putinki]], Moscow (1652). Assuming that such constructions ran counter to the traditional Byzantine type, the Patriarch Nikon declared them un-canonical. He encouraged building elaborate ecclesiastical residences (such as the [[Rostov]] Kremlin on the [[Nero Lake]] which featured five tall churches, many towers, palaces, and chambers). Nikon designed his new residence at the [[New Jerusalem Monastery]] which was dominated by a rotunda-like cathedral, the first of its type in Russia.

Since the tents were banned, the Muscovite architects had to replace them with successive rows of [[corbel]] arches ([[kokoshniki]]), and this decorative element was to become a hallmark of 17th-century Moscow flamboyant style.&lt;!---Be careful not to link this to Flamboyant Gothic, one of the distinct phases of Gothic in Western Europe. The word means "flame-like" and is applied to an arch or dome which has an S curve, or onion shape.---&gt; An early example of the flamboyant style is the [[Kazan Cathedral on Red Square]] (1633–36). By the end of the century, more than 100 churches in the fiery style were erected in Moscow, and perhaps as many again in the neighbouring region. Among the more splendid examples are the Moscow [[Kitai-gorod#Architecture|churches of the Holy Trinity]] at Nikitniki (1653), [[Church of St. Nicholas of the Weavers|St Nicholas at Khamovniki]] (1682), and Holy Trinity at [[Ostankino District|Ostankino]] (1692). Probably the most representative flamboyant-style structure was the Church of St Nicholas (the "Grand Cross") in the [[Kitai-gorod]], brutally destroyed at [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] behest.

As Russian architecture degenerated into the purely decorative, it was also influenced by the [[Polish Baroque|Polish]] and [[Ukrainian Baroque]]. The first [[baroque]] churches were small chapels built on the [[Naryshkin]] family estates near Moscow, so the name of [[Naryshkin baroque]] is often applied to this style. Some of these churches are tower-like, with cubic and octagonal floors placed atop each other (the Saviour Church at Ubory, 1697); others have a ladder-like composition, with a bell tower rising above the church itself (the [[Church of the Intercession at Fili|Intercession Church at Fili]], 1695). The Baroque and flamboyant-style decoration is often so profuse that the church seems to be the work of a jeweller rather than a mason (e.g., the Trinity Church at Lykovo, 1696). Perhaps the most delightful example of the Naryshkin baroque was the multi-domed [[Naryshkin Baroque|Assumption Church on the Pokrovka Street]] in Moscow (built 1696-99, demolished 1929). Its architect was also responsible for the "red and white" reconstruction of several Moscow monastic structures, notably the [[Novodevichy Convent]] and the [[Donskoy Monastery]].

The Baroque style quickly spread throughout Russia, gradually replacing more traditional and canonical architecture. The [[Stroganov]] merchants sponsored construction of majestic Baroque structures in [[Nizhny Novgorod]] (the [[Nizhny Novgorod#Strongest fortress of Muscovy|Nativity Church]], 1703) and in the remote tundra region (the Presentation Cathedral in [[Solvychegodsk]], 1693). During the first decades of the 18th century, some remarkable Baroque cathedrals were built in such eastern towns as [[Kazan]], [[Solikamsk]], [[Verkhoturye]], [[Tobolsk]] and [[Irkutsk]]. Also interesting are the traditional wooden churches by carpenters of the Russian North. Working without hammer and nails, they constructed such bizarre structures as the 24-domed Intercession Church at [[Vytegra]] (1708, burnt down 1963) and the 22-domed Transfiguration Church at [[Kizhi]] (1714).

== Imperial Russia (1712–1917) ==
{{see also|Petrine Baroque|Neoclassical architecture in Russia|Russian Revival architecture}}

In 1712, [[Peter I of Russia]] moved the capital from Moscow to [[St Petersburg]], which he planned to design in the Dutch style usually called [[Petrine baroque]]. Its major monuments include the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] and [[Menshikov Palace]].
During the reign of [[Empress Anna]] and [[Elizaveta Petrovna]], Russian architecture was dominated by the luxurious baroque style of [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]; Rastrelli's signature buildings include the [[Winter Palace]], the [[Catherine Palace]] and the [[Smolny Cathedral]]. Other distinctive monuments of the [[Elizabethan Baroque]] are the bell tower of the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]] and the [[Red Gate]].

[[Catherine the Great]] dismissed Rastrelli and patronized [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architects invited from [[Scotland]] and [[Italy]]. Some representative buildings from her reign are the [[Alexander Palace]] (by [[Giacomo Quarenghi]]) and the Trinity Cathedral of the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra]] (by [[Ivan Starov]]). During Catherine's reign, the Russian Gothic Revival style was developed by [[Vasily Bazhenov]] and [[Matvei Kazakov]] in [[Moscow]].
[[Alexander I of Russia]] favoured the [[Empire style]], which became ''de facto'' the only style of his period, evidenced by the [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]], the [[Admiralty building, Saint Petersburg|Admiralty building]], the [[Bolshoi Theatre]], [[St Isaac's Cathedral]], and the [[Narva Triumphal Gate]]s in Saint Petersburg. The Empire style's influence was even greater in Moscow, which had to rebuild thousands of houses destroyed by the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|fire of 1812]].

In the 1830s [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] eased regulation in architecture, opening the trade to several incarnations of early [[eclecticism]]. [[Konstantin Ton]]'s pseudo-Russian designs became the preferred choice in church construction ([[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], 1832–1883), while his public buildings followed [[Renaissance]] tradition, exemplified in the [[Great Kremlin Palace]] (1838–49) and the [[Kremlin Armoury]] (1844–1851). The subsequent reigns of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] and [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] promoted a Russian Byzantine revival in church architecture, while civil construction followed the same variety of eclectisicm common in all European countries; this featured ever-growing national revival trends, vernacular and imaginary (see [[Russian Revival architecture]]).

Between 1895 and 1905 architecture was briefly dominated by [[Art Nouveau]], most active in Moscow ([[Lev Kekushev]], [[Fyodor Schechtel]] and [[William Walcot]]). While it remained a popular choice until the outbreak of [[World War I]], in 1905-1914 it gave way to the [[Russian neoclassical revival]]—merging the Empire style and [[palladian architecture|palladian]] tradition with contemporary construction technology.

{{main|Constructivist architecture}}

In the first year of Soviet rule all architects refusing to emigrate (and the new generation) denounced any classical heritage in their work and began to propagate [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], the most influential of all [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revivalist]] themes. Great plans were drawn for large, technically advanced cities. The most ambitious of all was the [[Tatlin's Tower|Tower of the Third Internationale]], planned in 1919 by [[Vladimir Tatlin]] (1885–1953)—а 400-[[meter]] spiral, wound around a tilted central axis with rotating glass chambers. Impossible in real life, the Tatlin Tower inspired a generation of [[Constructivist architecture|constructivist]] architects in Russia and abroad. The [[Shukhov Tower]], rising {{convert|160|m|ft}} above Moscow, was completed in 1922. According to the initial plans the [[Hyperboloid structure|Hyperboloid Tower]] by [[Vladimir Shukhov]] with a height of {{convert|350|m|ft}} had an estimated mass of {{convert|2200|t|kg}}, while the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris (with a height of {{convert|350|m|ft}}) weighs {{convert|7300|t|kg}}.

Residents of apartment buildings were sealed, they were hooked by new tenants. The so-called communal apartments became the most common type of accommodation for the residents of large cities. In each communal apartment one room belonged to one family, while bathroom, toilet and kitchen were shared. Such a scheme was widespread until the mid-1950s, and in some cities there are more communal apartments. At the same time with the 1930s for senior people began to build houses with separate bedroom apartments, where one family was given the whole apartment. An example of such a house called [[House on the Embankment]] (Dom na naberezhnoi) in Moscow, built in 1927-1931, respectively.

An important priority during the post-revolutionary period was the mass reconstruction of cities. In 1918 [[Alexey Shchusev]] (1873–1949) and [[Ivan Zholtovsky]] founded the [[Mossovet]] Architectural Workshop, where the complex planning of Moscow's reconstruction as a new Soviet capital took place. The workshop employed young architects who later emerged as [[avant-garde]] leaders. At the same time architectural education, concentrated in the [[Vkhutemas]], was divided between revivalists and modernists.

In 1919 [[Petrograd]] saw a similar planning and educational setup, headed by experienced revivalist [[Ivan Fomin]] (1872–1936). Other cities followed suit, and the results of the work carried out there were to make dramatic changes in traditional Russian city layout. The first large-scale development templates (''generalny plan'') were drawn there. The city was planned as a series of new wide avenues, massive public structures and the improvement of workers' housing with heat and plumbing. The first apartment building of this period was completed in 1923, followed by a surge of public-housing construction in 1925-1929.

In Petrograd from 1917 to 1919 the first example of the new style was built on the [[Field of Mars (Saint Petersburg)|Field of Mars]]— a monument, "Strugglers of the Revolution", designed by [[Lev Rudnev]] (1886–1956). This complex consisted of a series of simple, expressive granite monoliths and became the focal point for further development in Soviet sculptural and memorial architecture.
The most famous construction of this time, however, was [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] by Alexey Shchusev. Originally it was a temporary wooden structure, topped by a pyramid, with two wings (for entry and exit). In 1930 it was replaced with the present building, built of stone. The combination of dark red and black [[labradorite]] enhanced its slender, precise construction.

The rapid development of technological processes and materials also influenced constructivist elements in structure design. During the erection of the Volkhov Hydroelectric Station (1918–26, architects O.Munts and V.Pokrovsky), the traditional outline on the window arches is still used (despite concrete being used in construction). The [[Dnieper Hydroelectric Station]] (1927–32), built by a collective of architects headed by [[Viktor Aleksandrovic Vesnin|Viktor Vesnin]] (1882–1950), has an innovative design featuring a curved dam with a rhythmic pattern of foundations.
&lt;!-- [[File:КЗ2.JPG|thumb|left|225px|Zuyev Club in Moscow]]--&gt;
Creative unions played a large role in the architectural life of 1920s Russia. One of these was the Association of New Architects (''Asnova''), formed in 1923, which promoted the idea of synthesising architecture and other creative arts to give buildings an almost sculptural feeling. These buildings were to serve as visual points for the orientation of a human in space. Members of ''Asnova'' also designed Moscow's first skyscrapers, none of which were realised at the time (1923–1926).

Another innovation from post-revolutionary Russia was a new type of public building: the workers' club and the [[Palace of Culture]]. These became a new focus for architects, who used the visual expression of large elements combined with industrial motifs. The most famous of these was the [[Zuev Workers' Club|Zuev Club]] (1927–29) in Moscow by [[Ilya Golosov]] (1883–1945), whose composition relied on the dynamic contrast of simple shapes, planes, complete walls and glazed surfaces.

Symbolic expression in construction was a feature in works designed by [[Konstantin Melnikov]] (1890–1974), notably the [[Rusakov Workers' Club]] (1927–1929) in Moscow. Visually, the building resembles part of a gear; each of the three cantilevered concrete "teeth" is a balcony of the main auditorium, which could be used individually or combined into a large theater hall. The sharpness of its composition and the "transition" of internal space (called by Melnikov a "tensed muscle") made it one of the most important examples of Soviet architecture.

{{main|Stalinist Architecture}}

[[Stalinist architecture]] put a premium on conservative monumentalism. During the 1930s there was rapid urbanisation as a result of Stalin's policies, and there was an international competition to build the [[Palace of the Soviets]] in Moscow at that time.
After 1945, the focus was on both rebuilding structures destroyed in [[World War II]] and erecting new ones: [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|seven high-rise buildings]] were built at symbolic points in the Moscow area. The construction of [[Moscow University]] (1948–1953), by [[Lev Rudnev]] and associates, is particularly notable for its use of space. Another example is the [[All-Russia Exhibition Centre|Exhibition Centre in Moscow]], built for the second All-Union Agricultural Exhibition (''VSKhV'') in 1954. This featured a series of pavilions, each decorated in representative style. Other well-known examples are the stations of the [[Moscow Metro|Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg Metro]]s built during the 1940s and 1950s, famous for their extravagant design and vivid decoration. In general, Stalinist architecture changed the appearance of many post-war cities; much survives to this day in central avenues and public buildings.

Following Stalin's death in 1953, social and political changes rocked the country; construction priorities and architecture were also affected. In 1955 [[Nikita Khrushchev]], faced with the slow pace of housing construction, called for drastic measures to accelerate the process. This involved developing new mass-production technology and removing "decorative extras" from buildings. On special plants that were built in every major city had launched production of special concrete blocks ready openings for doors and windows of which were built houses. These blocks were brought from the factory ready-made and installed on the steel frame of a house. Houses built in this way were called block houses. All projects such houses have become standardized and have been summarized in several series (for example II-32 series), which were built houses. Projects for a buyout built schools, kindergartens and hospitals were also typical.
This put an effective end to Stalinist architecture; however, the transition was slow. Most projects in the planning state or under construction by 1955 were directly affected; the result, at times, was entire areas becoming esthetically asymmetrical.
A well-known example occurred in the postwar reconstruction of the Ukrainian capital, [[Kiev]], in which the planned [[Khreshchatyk|Kreschatik]] avenue and its central square ([[Maidan Nezalezhnosti|Ploschad Kalinina]]) were to form a single rich space enclosed by Stalinist construction. However, as the buildings enclosing the latter were in completion, the architects were forced to alter their plans and the area was left unfinished until the early 1980s. In particular [[Hotel Ukrayina]], which was to crown the square with a look similar to one of [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|Moscow's "Seven sisters"]], was left as a solid shape without a top spire or any rich external decoration.

Nevertheless, as the buildings became more square and simple they brought with them a new style fueled by the [[Space Age]]: functionality. The [[State Kremlin Palace]] is an hommage to an earlier attempt to bridge rapidly changing styles dictated by the state. The [[Ostankino Tower]], by [[Nikolai Nikitin]], symbolizes technological advances and the future.
In addition to simpler buildings, the 1960s are remembered for massive housing plans. A typical project was developed using concrete panels to make a simple, five-story house. These ''Pyatietazhki'' became the dominant housing construction. Although rapidly built, their quality was poor compared with earlier housing; their monotonous appearance contributed to the grey and dull stereotype characteristic of socialist cities.

As the 1970s began, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] allowed architects more freedom; soon, housing of varied design was built. Blocks of flats were taller and more decorated; large mosaics on their sides became a feature. In nearly all cases, these were built not as standalone construction but as part of large estates ({{lang-fr|housing massif}}) which soon became a central feature of socialist cities. In contrast to the houses built in the 1950s-1960s, which had up to 5 floors, new residential buildings were higher and could have up to 9 or more floors, although the house with fewer floors continued to be built. Each complex includes an extensive area with a yard for walks, a playground with swings, a sandbox for the games and sites for parking vehicles, which are often supplemented by garages for cars, lined up separately from the residential buildings. This principle remains today.Public buildings were built with a variety of themes. Some (like the [[White House of Russia]]) made direct connections to earlier 1950s architecture, with a white marble-faced exterior and large ''bas-reliefs'' on the wings.

&lt;/center&gt;

== Modern Russia ==
[[File:Moscow City2018.jpg|350px|thumb|Moscow International Business Center]]
As the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union fell apart]] many of its projects were put on hold, and some cancelled altogether. However, for the first time there was no longer any control over what theme a building should have or how high it should be. As a result, with generally improving financial conditions architecture grew at a high rate. For the first time modern methods of skyscraper construction were implemented, this resulted in an ambitious [[Moscow International Business Center]]. In other cases, architects returned to successful designs of Stalinist architecture, which resulted in buildings like the [[Triumph Palace]] in Moscow. [[New Classical Architecture]] is also appearing more consistently throughout modern Russia, with a large complex being proposed for [[Saint Petersburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewcusack.com/2014/russias-classical-future/|title=Russia's Classical Future|author=|date=30 September 2014|website=andrewcusack.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sea ice''' arises as [[seawater]] freezes. Because [[ice]] is less [[density|dense]] than water, it floats on the ocean's surface (as does [[fresh water]] ice, which has an even lower density). Sea ice covers about 7% of the Earth's surface and about 12% of the world's oceans.&lt;ref name="Wadhams"&gt;{{cite web |title= How Does Arctic Sea Ice Form and Decay? |publisher= NOAA |work= Arctic theme page |url= http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/essay_wadhams.html |last=Wadhams |first=Peter |date=1 Jan 2003 |accessdate=25 April 2005 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306040652/http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/essay_wadhams.html |archive-date=2005-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;{{cite book |first=Willy F. |last=Weeks |title=On Sea Ice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9S55O6WzuL8C&amp;pg=PA2 |date=2010 |publisher=University of Alaska Press |isbn=978-1-60223-101-6 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shokr&amp;Sinha"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shokr |first1=Mohammed |first2=Nirmal |last2=Sinha |title=Sea Ice - Physics and Remote Sensing |date=2015 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-1119027898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the world's sea ice is enclosed within the polar ice packs in the Earth's [[polar region]]s: the [[Arctic ice pack]] of the [[Arctic Ocean]] and the [[Antarctic ice pack]] of the [[Southern Ocean]]. Polar packs undergo a significant yearly cycling in surface extent, a natural process upon which depends the [[Arctic ecology]], including the [[Arctic sea ice ecology and history|ocean's ecosystems]]. Due to the action of winds, currents and temperature fluctuations, sea ice is very dynamic, leading to a wide variety of ice types and features. Sea ice may be contrasted with [[iceberg]]s, which are chunks of [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] or [[glacier]]s that [[Ice calving|calve]] into the ocean. Depending on location, sea ice expanses may also incorporate icebergs.

Sea ice does not simply grow and melt. During its lifespan, it is very dynamic. Due to the combined action of winds, currents, water temperature, and air temperature fluctuations, sea ice expanses typically undergo a significant amount of deformation. Sea ice is classified according to whether or not it is able to drift, and according to its age.

=== Fast ice versus drift (or pack) ice ===
Sea ice can be classified according to whether or not it is attached (or frozen) to the shoreline (or between [[shoal]]s or to grounded [[iceberg]]s). If attached, it is called landfast ice, or more often, [[fast ice]] (from ''fastened''). Alternatively, and unlike fast ice, [[drift ice]] occurs further offshore in very wide areas, and encompasses ice that is free to move with currents and winds. The physical boundary between fast ice and drift ice is the ''fast ice boundary''. The drift ice zone may be further divided into a ''shear zone'', a ''marginal ice zone'' and a ''central pack''.&lt;ref name="Lepp"&gt;{{cite book |first=Matti |last=Leppr̃anta |title=The Drift Of Sea Ice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJwub7E6VDcC |date=2005 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-40881-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drift ice consists of ''floes'', individual pieces of sea ice {{convert|20|m|ft}} or more across. There are names for various floe sizes: ''small'' – {{convert|20 to 100|m|ft|abbr=on}}; ''medium'' – {{convert|100 to 500|m|ft|abbr=on}}; ''big'' – {{convert|500 to 2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}; ''vast'' – {{convert|2 to 10|km|mi}}; and ''giant'' – more than {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=NSIDC&gt;{{harvnb|NSIDC All About Sea Ice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECGlossary"&gt;{{harvnb|Environment Canada Ice Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''pack ice'' is used either as a synonym to ''drift ice'',&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt; or to designate drift ice zone in which the floes are densely packed.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; The overall sea ice cover is termed the ''ice canopy'' from the perspective of submarine navigation.&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt;

=== Classification based on age ===
Another classification used by scientists to describe sea ice is based on age, that is, on its development stages. These stages are: ''new ice'', ''nilas'', ''young ice'', ''first-year'' and ''old''.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt;

==== New ice, nilas and young ice ====
[[File:Nilas Sea Ice.JPG|thumb|Nilas in [[Baffin Bay]]]]
''New ice'' is a general term used for recently frozen sea water that does not yet make up solid ice. It may consist of [[frazil ice]] (plates or spicules of ice suspended in water), [[slush]] (water saturated snow), or ''shuga'' (spongy white ice lumps a few centimeters across). Other terms, such as [[grease ice]] and [[pancake ice]], are used for ice crystal accumulations under the action of wind and waves.

''Nilas'' designates a sea ice crust up to {{convert|10|cm|in}} in thickness. It bends without breaking around waves and swells. Nilas can be further subdivided into ''dark nilas'' – up to {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness and very dark, and ''light nilas'' – over {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness and lighter in color.

''Young ice'' is a transition stage between nilas and first-year ice, and ranges in thickness from {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}, Young ice can be further subdivided into ''grey ice'' – {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness, and ''grey-white ice'' – {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness. Young ice is not as flexible as nilas, but tends to break under wave action. In a compression regime, it will either raft (at the grey ice stage) or ridge (at the grey-white ice stage).

==== First-year sea ice ====
[[File:FYvsSYvsMY.svg|thumb|Distinction between 1st year sea ice (FY), 2nd year (SY), multiyear (MY) and old ice.]]
''First-year sea ice'' is ice that is thicker than ''young ice'' but has no more than one year growth. In other words, it is ice that grows in the fall and winter (after it has gone through the ''new ice — nilas — young ice'' stages and grows further) but does not survive the spring and summer months (it melts away). The thickness of this ice typically ranges from {{convert|0.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; First-year ice may be further divided into ''thin'' ({{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|70|cm|ft|abbr=on}}), ''medium'' ({{convert|70|cm|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|120|cm|ft|abbr=on}}) and ''thick'' (&gt;{{convert|120|cm|ft|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"&gt;{{harvnb|WMO Sea-Ice Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Old sea ice ====
''Old sea ice'' is sea ice that has survived at least one melting season (''i.e.'' one summer). For this reason, this ice is generally thicker than first-year sea ice. Old ice is commonly divided into two types: ''second-year ice'', which has survived one melting season, and ''multiyear ice'', which has survived more than one. (In some sources,&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt; ''old ice'' is more than 2-years old.) Multi-year ice is much more common in the [[Arctic]] than it is in the [[Antarctic]].&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wadhams2"&gt;{{cite book |first=P. |last=Wadhams |title=Ice in the Ocean |date=2000 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-90-5699-296-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that sea ice in the south drifts into warmer waters where it melts. In the Arctic, much of the sea ice is land-locked.

=== Driving forces ===
While [[fast ice]] is relatively stable (because it is attached to the shoreline or the seabed), [[Drift ice|drift (or pack) ice]] undergoes relatively complex deformation processes that ultimately give rise to sea ice's typically wide variety of landscapes. Wind is thought to be the main driving force along with ocean currents.&lt;ref name="Wadhams"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt; The [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis force]] and sea ice surface tilt have also been invoked.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt; These driving forces induce a state of stress within the drift ice zone. An [[Drift ice|ice floe]] converging toward another and pushing against it will generate a state of ''compression'' at the boundary between both. The ice cover may also undergo a state of ''tension'', resulting in divergence and fissure opening. If two floes drift sideways past each other while remaining in contact, this will create a state of ''[[shear (geology)|shear]]''.

=== Deformation ===
Sea ice deformation results from the interaction between ice floes, as they are driven against each other. The end result may be of three types of features:&lt;ref name="ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; 1) [[Finger rafting|Rafted ice]], when one piece is overriding another; 2) [[Pressure ridge (ice)|Pressure ridges]], a line of broken ice forced downward (to make up the ''keel'') and upward (to make the ''sail''); and 3) ''[[Hummock]]'', an hillock of broken ice that forms an uneven surface. A ''shear ridge'' is a pressure ridge that formed under shear – it tends to be more linear than a ridge induced only by compression.&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; A ''new ridge'' is a recent feature — it is sharp-crested, with its side sloping at an angle exceeding 40 degrees. In contrast, a ''weathered ridge'' is one with a rounded crest and with sides sloping at less than 40 degrees.&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt; [[Stamukha|Stamukhi]] are yet another type of pile-up but these are grounded and are therefore relatively stationary. They result from the interaction between [[fast ice]] and the drifting pack ice.

''Level ice'' is sea ice that has not been affected by deformation, and is therefore relatively flat.&lt;ref name=" ECGlossary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WMO"/&gt;

=== Leads and polynyas ===
[[Lead (sea ice)|Leads]] and [[polynyas]] are areas of open water that occur within sea ice expanses even though air temperatures are below freezing, and provide a direct interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere, which is important for the wildlife. Leads are narrow and linear – they vary in width from meter to km scale. During the winter, the water in leads quickly freezes up. They are also used for navigation purposes – even when refrozen, the ice in leads is thinner, allowing icebreakers access to an easier sail path, and submarines to surface more easily. Polynyas are more uniform in size than leads and are also larger – two types are recognized: 1) ''Sensible-heat polynyas'', caused by the upwelling of warmer water and 2) ''Latent-heat polynyas'', resulting from persistent winds from the coastline.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;

==Formation==
{{main|Sea ice growth processes}}
[[File:Seaice.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of sea ice forming near [[St. Matthew Island]] in the Bering Sea.]]

Only the top layer of water needs to cool to the freezing point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=drgjDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Only+the+top+layer+of+water+needs+to+cool+to+the+freezing+point#v=onepage&amp;q=Only%20the%20top%20layer%20of%20water%20needs%20to%20cool%20to%20the%20freezing%20point&amp;f=false|title=Microclimate and Local Climate|last=Barry|first=Roger G.|last2=Blanken|first2=Peter D.|date=2016-05-23|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316652336|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convection of the surface layer involves the top {{convert|100|–|150|m|abbr=on}}, down to the [[pycnocline]] of increased density.

In calm water, the first sea ice to form on the surface is a skim of separate crystals which initially are in the form of tiny discs, floating flat on the surface and of diameter less than {{convert|0.3|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Each disc has its c-axis vertical and grows outwards laterally. At a certain point such a disc shape becomes unstable, and the growing isolated crystals take on a hexagonal, stellar form, with long fragile arms stretching out over the surface. These crystals also have their c-axis vertical. The dendritic arms are very fragile, and soon break off, leaving a mixture of discs and arm fragments. With any kind of turbulence in the water, these fragments break up further into random-shaped small crystals which form a suspension of increasing density in the surface water, an ice type called [[frazil ice|frazil or grease ice]]. In quiet conditions the frazil crystals soon freeze together to form a continuous thin sheet of young ice; in its early stages, when it is still transparent — that is the ice called ''nilas''. Once nilas has formed, a quite different growth process occurs, in which water freezes on to the bottom of the existing ice sheet, a process called ''congelation'' growth. This growth process yields first-year ice.

In rough water, fresh sea ice is formed by the cooling of the ocean as heat is lost into the atmosphere. The uppermost layer of the ocean is [[supercooling|supercooled]] to slightly below the freezing point, at which time tiny ice platelets (frazil ice) form. With time, this process leads to a mushy surface layer, known as [[grease ice]]. Frazil ice formation may also be started by [[snow]]fall, rather than supercooling. Waves and wind then act to compress these ice particles into larger plates, of several meters in diameter, called [[pancake ice]]. These float on the [[ocean surface]], and collide with one another, forming upturned edges. In time, the pancake ice plates may themselves be rafted over one another or frozen together into a more solid ice cover, known as consolidated pancake ice. Such ice has a very rough appearance on top and bottom.

If sufficient snow falls on sea ice to depress the freeboard below sea level, sea water will flow in and a layer of ice will form of mixed snow/sea water. This is particularly common around [[Antarctica]].

[[Russia]]n scientist [[Vladimir Wiese|Vladimir Vize]] (1886–1954) devoted his life to study the Arctic ice pack and developed the ''Scientific Prediction of Ice Conditions Theory'', for which he was widely acclaimed in academic circles. He applied this theory in the field in the [[Kara Sea]], which led to the discovery of [[Vize Island]].

==Yearly freeze and melt cycle==

[[Image:Arctic-ice-with-labels.png|thumb|Volume of arctic sea ice over time using a polar coordinate system draw method (time goes counter clockwise; one cycle per year)]]

The annual freeze and melt cycle is set by the annual cycle of solar insolation and of ocean and atmospheric temperature, and of variability in this annual cycle.

In the Arctic, the area of ocean covered by sea ice increases over winter from a minimum in September to a maximum in March or sometimes February, before melting over the summer. In the Antarctic, where the seasons are reversed, the annual minimum is typically in February and the annual maximum in September or October, and the presence of sea ice abutting the calving fronts of [[Ice shelf|ice shelves]] has been shown to influence glacier flow and potentially the stability of the [[Antarctic ice sheet|Antarctic Ice Sheet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greene|first=Chad A.|last2=Young|first2=Duncan A.|last3=Gwyther|first3=David E.|last4=Galton-Fenzi|first4=Benjamin K.|last5=Blankenship|first5=Donald D.|date=2018-09-06|title=Seasonal dynamics of Totten Ice Shelf controlled by sea ice buttressing|url=https://www.the-cryosphere.net/12/2869/2018/|journal=The Cryosphere|language=English|volume=12|issue=9|pages=2869–2882|doi=10.5194/tc-12-2869-2018|issn=1994-0416|via=|bibcode=2018TCry...12.2869G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massom|first=Robert A.|last2=Scambos|first2=Theodore A.|last3=Bennetts|first3=Luke G.|last4=Reid|first4=Phillip|last5=Squire|first5=Vernon A.|last6=Stammerjohn|first6=Sharon E.|date=2018|title=Antarctic ice shelf disintegration triggered by sea ice loss and ocean swell|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0212-1|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=558|issue=7710|pages=383–389|doi=10.1038/s41586-018-0212-1|pmid=29899449|issn=0028-0836|via=|bibcode=2018Natur.558..383M}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The growth and melt rate are also affected by the state of the ice itself. During growth, the ice thickening due to freezing (as opposed to dynamics) is itself dependent on the thickness, so that the ice growth slows as the ice thickens.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt; Likewise, during melt, thinner sea ice melts faster. This leads to different behaviour between multiyear and first year ice. In addition, [[melt pond]]s on the ice surface during the melt season lower the [[albedo]] such that more solar radiation is absorbed, leading to a feedback where melt is accelerated. The presence of melt ponds is affected by the [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of the sea ice- i.e. whether meltwater can drain- and the [[topography]] of the sea ice surface, i.e. the presence of natural basins for the melt ponds to form in. First year ice is flatter than multiyear ice due to the lack of dynamic ridging, so ponds tend to have greater area. They also have lower albedo since they are on thinner ice, which blocks less of the solar radiation from reaching the dark ocean below.

==Monitoring and observations==
{{main|Measurement of sea ice}}
{{see also|Arctic sea ice decline|Arctic sea ice decline#Ice-free summer|Antarctic sea ice}}

Changes in sea ice conditions are best demonstrated by the rate of melting over time. A composite record of Arctic ice demonstrates that the floes' retreat began around 1900, experiencing more rapid melting beginning within the past 50 years {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}. Satellite study of sea ice began in 1979, and became a much more reliable measure of long-term changes in sea ice. In comparison to the extended record, the sea-ice extent in the polar region by September 2007 was only half the recorded mass that had been estimated to exist within the 1950–1970 period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=6|last=Polyak |first=Leonid|author2=Richard B.

[[Arctic]] sea ice extent ice hit an all-time low in September 2012, when the ice was determined to cover only 24% of the Arctic Ocean, offsetting the previous low of 29% in 2007. Predictions of when the first [[Arctic sea ice decline#Ice-free summer|"ice free" Arctic summer]] might occur vary.

[[Antarctic sea ice]] extent gradually increased in the period of satellite observations, which began in 1979, until a rapid decline in southern hemisphere spring of 2016.

==Relationship to global warming and climate change==
[[File:Ponds on the Ocean, ICESCAPE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|As ice melts, the liquid water collects in depressions on the surface and deepens them, forming these melt ponds in the [[Arctic]]. These fresh water ponds are separated from the salty sea below and around it, until breaks in the ice merge the two.]]
Sea ice provides an ecosystem for various polar species, particularly the [[polar bear]], whose environment is being threatened as global warming causes the ice to melt more as the Earth's temperature gets warmer. Furthermore, the sea ice itself functions to help keep polar climates cool, since the ice exists in expansive enough amounts to maintain a cold environment. At this, sea ice's relationship with global warming is cyclical; the ice helps to maintain cool climates, but as the global temperature increases, the ice melts, and is less effective in keeping those climates cold. The bright, shiny surface ([[albedo]]) of the ice also serves a role in maintaining cooler polar temperatures by reflecting much of the sunlight that hits it back into space. As the sea ice melts, its surface area shrinks, diminishing the size of the reflective surface and therefore causing the earth to absorb more of the sun's heat. As the ice melts it lowers the albedo thus causing more heat to be absorbed by the Earth and further increase the amount of melting ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://climate.ncsu.edu/edu/k12/.albedo |title=Albedo |work=Climate Education Modules for K-12 |publisher=NC State University |access-date=2017-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170529115402/https://climate.ncsu.edu/edu/k12/.albedo |archivedate=29 May 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the size of the [[ice floes]] is affected by the seasons, even a small change in global temperature can greatly affect the amount of sea ice, and due to the shrinking reflective surface that keeps the ocean cool, this sparks a cycle of ice shrinking and temperatures warming. As a result, the polar regions are the most susceptible places to climate change on the planet.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;

Furthermore, sea ice affects the movement of ocean waters. In the [[freezing]] process, much of the salt in ocean water is squeezed out of the frozen crystal formations, though some remains frozen in the ice. This salt becomes trapped beneath the sea ice, creating a higher concentration of salt in the water beneath ice floes. This concentration of salt contributes to the salinated water's [[density]], and this cold, denser water sinks to the bottom of the ocean. This cold water moves along the ocean floor towards the equator, while warmer water on the ocean surface moves in the direction of the poles. This is referred to as "[[Thermohaline circulation|conveyor belt]] motion", and is a regularly occurring process.&lt;ref name=NSIDC/&gt;

==Modelling==
In order to gain a better understanding about the variability, numerical sea ice models are used to perform [[Sensitivity analysis|sensitivity studies]]. The two main ingredients are the [[ice dynamics]] and the thermodynamical properties (see [[Sea ice emissivity modelling]], [[Sea ice growth processes]] and [[Sea ice thickness]]).

Many [[global climate model]]s (GCMs) have sea ice implemented in their numerical simulation scheme in order to capture the [[Ice-albedo feedback]] correctly. Examples include:
* The Louvain-la-Neuve Sea Ice Model is a numerical model of sea ice designed for climate studies and operational oceanography developed at [[Université catholique de Louvain]]. It is coupled to the ocean general circulation model OPA (Ocean Parallélisé) and is freely available as a part of the [[Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean]].
* The [[MIT General Circulation Model]] is a [[Global climate model|global circulation model]] developed at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] includes a package for sea-ice. The code is freely available there.
* The [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]] develops the Community Sea Ice Model.
* The [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] has a project called Los Alamos Sea Ice Model. The project is [[open source]] and designed as a component of GCM, although it provides a standalone mode.
* The Finite-Element Sea-Ice Ocean Model developed at [[Alfred Wegener Institute]] uses an [[unstructured grid]].

The [[Coupled model intercomparison project]] offers a standard protocol for studying the output of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. The coupling takes place at the atmosphere-ocean interface where the sea ice may occur.

In addition to global modeling, various regional models deal with sea ice. Regional models are employed for seasonal forecasting experiments and for [[process study|process studies]].

==Ecology==
{{main|Sympagic ecology}}

Sea ice is part of the Earth's [[biosphere]]. When sea water freezes, the ice is riddled with brine-filled channels which sustain [[Sympagic ecology|sympagic organisms]] such as bacteria, algae, copepods and annelids, which in turn provide food for animals such as krill and specialised fish like the [[Bald notothen]], fed upon in turn by larger animals such as [[Emperor penguins]] and [[Minke whales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acecrc.sipex.aq/access/page/?page=d664da82-b244-102a-8ea7-0019b9ea7c60 |title=Sea Ice Ecology |website=Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment (SIPEX) |publisher=Antarctic Climate &amp; Ecosystems CRC |accessdate=23 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320075657/http://www.acecrc.sipex.aq/access/page/?page=d664da82-b244-102a-8ea7-0019b9ea7c60 |archive-date=2012-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spatial contextual awareness''' consociates contextual information such as an individual's or sensor's location, activity, the time of day, and proximity to other people or objects and devices.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;Chen, Guanling, and David Kotz. 2000. A Survey of Context-Aware Mobile Computing Research. Dartmouth Computer Science Technical Report TR2000-381.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also defined as the relationship between and synthesis of information garnered from the spatial environment&lt;ref&gt; Hemakumara,  GPTS.  and  Rainis,  R.  2018.  Spatial  behaviour  modelling  of unauthorised housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka. KEMANUSIAAN  the  Asian  Journal  of  Humanities25(2): 91–107, https://doi.org/10.21315/kajh2018.25.2.5 

Spatial Behaviour Modelling of Unauthorised Housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka | Request PDF. Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327864214_Spatial_Behaviour_Modelling_of_Unauthorised_Housing_in_Colombo_Sri_Lanka [accessed Sep 27 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;, a cognitive agent, and a cartographic map.  The spatial environment is the physical space in which the orientation or wayfinding task is to be conducted; the cognitive agent is the person or entity charged with completing a task; and the map is the representation of the environment which is used as a tool to complete the task.&lt;ref name="Freska"&gt;Freksa, Christian, Alexander Klippel, and Stephan Winter. 2005. A Cognitive Perspective on Spatial Context. Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings 05491.&lt;/ref&gt;

An incomplete view of spatial contextual awareness would render it as simply a contributor to or an element of contextual awareness – that which specifies a point location on the earth.  This narrow definition omits the individual cognitive and computational functions involved in a complex geographic system.  Rather than defining the myriad of potential factors contributing to context, spatial contextual awareness defined in terms of cognitive processes permits a unique, user-centered perspective in which "conceptualizations imbue spatial structures with meaning."&lt;ref name="Freska"/&gt;

[[Context awareness]], geographic awareness, and ubiquitous cartography or Ubiquitous Geographic Information (UBGI) all contribute to the understanding of spatial contextual awareness.  They are also key elements in a map-based, [[location-based service]], or LBS.  In cases in which the user interface for the LBS is a map, cartographic design challenges must be addressed in order to effectively communicate the spatial context to the user.

Spatial contextual awareness can describe present context – the environment of the user at the present time and location, or that of a future context – where the user wants to go and what may be of interest to them in the approaching spatial environment.  Some location-based services are proactive systems which can anticipate future context.&lt;ref&gt;Mayrhofer, Rene, Harald Radi, and Alois Ferscha. 2003. Recognizing and Predicting Context by Learning from User Behavior. In ''The International Conference On Advances in Mobile Multimedia (MoMM2003)'', ed. W. Schreiner, G. Kotsis, A. Ferscha, and K. Ibrahim, volume 171, pages 25–35. Austrian Computer Society (OCG), September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Augmented reality is an application which guides a user through present and into future context by displaying spatial contextual information in their visual system as they traverse through real space.&lt;ref name="Gartner 2007a"&gt;Gartner, Georg. 2007a. Development of Multimedia – Mobile and Ubiquitous. In ''Multimedia Cartography'', ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 51-62. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous examples of LBS applications exist which require the ability to leverage spatial contextual awareness.  These applications are in demand by the general public and are examples of how maps are being used by individuals to help better understand the world and make daily decisions.&lt;ref name="Peterson 2007a"&gt;Peterson, Michael P. 2007a. Elements of Multimedia Cartography. In ''Multimedia Cartography'', ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 63-73. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context awareness==
[[Context awareness]] originated as a term from [[ubiquitous computing]] or as so-called pervasive computing which sought to deal with linking changes in the environment with computer systems, which are otherwise static.

Context is defined in multiple ways, most often with location as the cornerstone.  One source defines it as "location and the identity of nearby people and objects."   Another describes it as "location, identity, environment and time".&lt;ref name="Jiang"&gt;Jiang, Bin, and Xiaobai Yao. 2007. Location Based Services and GIS in Perspective.  In ''Location Based Services and TeleCartography'', ed. Georg Gartner, William Cartwright, and Michael P. Peterson, 27-45. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet some definitions recognize context awareness as being more inclusive than location.

Dey&lt;ref name="Dey"&gt;Dey, Anind K. 2001. Understanding and Using Context. ''Personal and Ubiquitous Computing'', Volume 5, 4-7. Springer London.&lt;/ref&gt; took this broader approach: "context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity, where entity means a person, place, or object, which is relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and the applications themselves."
The same author defined a system "to be context-aware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, in which the relevancy depends on the user's task".&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt;

[[Image:Contextual Awareness Fig 1.png|thumb|upright=1.40|alt=Contextual Awareness Diagram|Figure 1:&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; Contextual Awareness (Diagram after Li 2007)]]
The concept of relevancy is described in the following definition of context awareness: "the set of environmental states and settings that either determines an application's behavior or in which an application event occurs and is interesting to the user".&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;  Different levels of context, in terms of low and high level have also been outlined.  Low-level contexts consist of time, location, network bandwidth and orientation.  A high-level context consists of the user's current activity and social context.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;

A three-level model of context awareness (Figure 1) includes the changeable nature of the environment by differentiating between the contributions of static, dynamic, and internal context:&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;Li, Ki-Joune. 2007. Ubiquitous GIS, Part I: Basic Concepts of Ubiquitous GIS, Lecture Slides, Pusan National University.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Static context – stored digital geographic information which could impact the user's environment
* Dynamic context – information on the changeable aspects of the user's environment obtained by sensors/info services and provided in real time (e.g. weather forecasts, traffic reports)
* Internal context  – user information, to include personal preferences, location, speed, and orientation

Static content is driven by stored information while dynamic content is provided and updated by sensors.

Context categories for mobile maps have been identified through pilot user tests.  The categories in Table 1 were deemed useful for mobile map services:&lt;ref name="Nivala"/&gt;

==Geographic awareness==
[[Image:Spatial Contextual Awareness Fig 2.png|thumb|upright=1.40|alt=Spatial Contextual Awareness Diagram|Figure 2:&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; Spatial Contextual (or Geographic) Awareness (Diagram after Li 2007)]]
Geographic awareness, another term for spatial contextual awareness, clarifies the spatial and geographic aspects of context.  Being more than simply present location, it must also include other dimensions and their interdependencies.  Figure 2 shows Li's&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; components of context awareness and overlays them on multiple geographic reference systems.  To be effective, an LBS application must be able to operate in a heterogeneous space which includes different reference systems.  A user of a LBS must be able to seamlessly convert from a Euclidean space (Cartesian Reference Space), to a Linear Reference Space (LRS), to indoor space (to include perhaps the floor, wing, hallway, and room number).&lt;ref name="Hong"&gt;Hong, Sang-Ki, 2008. Ubiquitous Geographic Information (UBGI) and address standards. ISO Workshop on address standards: Considering the issues related to an international address standard. 25 May 2008. Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ubiquitous geographic information (UBGI)/Ubiquitous cartography==
Ubiquitous geographic information (UBGI) is geographic information which is provided at any time and any place to users or systems through communication devices.  Critical to the understanding of UBGI is that the information provided is based on the context of the user.  UBGI is more than data.  It includes a set of concepts, practices and standards for spatial and geographic information and processing for applications accessible for use by the general public.&lt;ref name="Hong"/&gt;

UBGI must also take into account the situation and goals of the user, or cognitive agent.  For that purpose, ubiquitous computing concepts employ sensors to collect data on the user's location as well as environmental parameters.&lt;ref name="Freska"/&gt;

[[Image:GI Evolution Fig 3.png|thumb|upright=1.40|alt=Evolution of Geographic Information Diagram|Figure 3:&lt;ref name="Hong"/&gt; The Evolution of Geographic Information (Diagram after Hong 2008)]]
Ubiquitous cartography is "the ability for users to create and use maps in any place and at any time to resolve geospatial problems".&lt;ref name="Gartner 2007b"&gt;Gartner, Georg. 2007b. LBS and TeleCartography: About the book.  In ''Location Based Services and TeleCartography'', ed. Georg Gartner, William Cartwright, and Michael P. Peterson, 1-11. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  The users and creators of these maps are more than just highly trained geographers and cartographers, but include the average citizen.  In contrast to the accused elitism of the [[GIS]] community in the early 80's when many advocated for separate technology because geospatial information was different and unattainable to common users or systems, today's goal of ubiquity is to make the user experience with GIS-enabled devices intuitive and simple to use.&lt;ref name="Herring"&gt;Herring, John R. n.d. Ubiquitous Geographic Information: Releasing GI from Its Ivory Tower, Oracle Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;  These devices and other multimedia cartography tools are playing a major role in the effort to get "maps out" to the general public and end the inexcusable practice of perfecting maps as a visualization form only for expert map users operating highly specialized [[Geographic Information Systems]].&lt;ref name="Peterson 2007a"/&gt;

The "ease-of-use" objective of ubiquitous cartography can be seen as the fourth generation in the evolution of geographic information.  UBGI was preceded by easily accessible of internet maps and the addition of contextual information of LBS and mobile mapping.  Digital geographic information was an essential precursor to accessible and mobile maps and these advancements are all an outgrowth of the first generation of paper maps and the effort to better represent and visualize the world (Fig. 3).&lt;ref name="Hong"/&gt;

==Location-based services (LBS)==
A [[location-based service]] (LBS) is an information and entertainment service, accessible with [[mobile devices]] through the [[mobile network]] and utilizing the ability to make use of the geographical position of the mobile device.

LBS services can be used in a variety of contexts, such as health, work, personal life, etc.  LBS services include services to identify a location of a person or object, such as discovering the nearest banking cash machine or the whereabouts of a friend or employee.  LBS services include parcel tracking and [[vehicle tracking]] services.  LBS can include [[mobile commerce]] when taking the form of coupons or advertising directed at customers based on their current location.  They include personalized weather services and even location-based games.  They are an example of [[telecommunication convergence]].

Location Based Services have the ability to exploit knowledge about the location of a user or an information device.  Whether the output of the device is a simple text message or an interactive graphic map, the user and the user's location are in some way incorporated into the overall system.&lt;ref name="Gartner 2007b"/&gt;

Other distinguishing characteristics of LBS include:&lt;ref name="Jiang"/&gt;
*Usually provide personalized services for a user on-the-move
*Based on diverse hardware and software platforms which utilize the internet, GIS, and location-aware devices and telecommunication services
*Receive data from various sources, sensors and systems
*Must integrate and process data in real-time
*Pose unique challenges for visualization due to the fact that the user's location could be constantly changing

LBS can be used to answer user questions which can be placed into four general categories: location, proximity, navigation, and events.  Examples include:&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher"&gt;Reichenbacher, Tumasch. 2001. The World in Your Pocket – Towards a Mobile Cartography. In Proceedings of the 20th International Cartographic Conference, August 6–10, Beijing, China, 4: 2514–2521.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Where am I?  Where is my destination?  [location]
*Where is the nearest bus stop or fast food restaurant?  [proximity]
*What is the best route to my destination?  [navigation]
*Is the latest movie showing at the local theater?  [events]

Another category is "measurement" to answer the question, how far away is my destination?&lt;ref name="Nivala"&gt;Nivala, Annu-Maaria, and L. Tiina Sarjakoski. 2003. Need for Context-Aware Topographic Maps in Mobile Devices, In ScanGIS'2003 -Proceedings of the 9th Scandinavian Research Conference on Geographical Information Science, June 4–6, Espoo, Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a routine function of personal automobile navigation devices.

New, innovative ideas continue to add to the types of questions in which LBS can answer for a user.  For example, computer vision and object based indexing can be used to both identify an object and assist a user in navigating from the location.  Spatial contextual awareness plays a key role in this process as it provides an initial geo-reference of the location while simplifying the object recognition process to a manageable degree.&lt;ref name="Luley"&gt;Luley, Patrick, Lucas Paletta, Alexander Almer, Mathias Schardt, Josef Ringert, 2007. Geo-Services and Computer Vision for Object Awareness in Mobile System Applications. In ''Location Based Services and TeleCartography'', ed. Georg Gartner, William Cartwright, and Michael P. Peterson, 291-300. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  This category of LBS use can be called "identification" and answers the question "What is it?"

==Cartographic challenges==
Applications which require the use of spatial contextual awareness in LBS are confronted with a multitude of cartographic challenges and decisions.  Some of these challenges are due to the small displays of the typical PDA user interface and method of use.&lt;ref name="Peterson 2007b"&gt;Peterson, Michael P. 2007b. The Internet and Multimedia Cartography. In ''Multimedia Cartography'', ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 35-50. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other problems result from the large volume of potentially relevant contextual data as difficult choices need to be made on the most important content to display.&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher 2007b"&gt;Reichenbacher, Tumasch. 2007b. The concept of relevance in mobile maps. In Location Based Services and TeleCartography, ed. Georg Gartner, William Cartwright, and Michael P. Peterson, 231-246. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

A sampling of some of these challenges are:

*Mobility – A map on a mobile platform is changing quickly to keep up with context changes; limited time to view map information before a change in scene may be required.&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher 2007a"&gt;Reichenbacher, Tumasch. 2007a. Adaptation in mobile and ubiquitous cartography.  In Multimedia Cartography, ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 383-397. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Adaptation – Refers to "the ability of flexible systems to be changed by the user or the system in order to meet specific requirements."  Users must be able to personalize the display to present content adaptable to their sophistication and familiarity of the environment&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher 2007a"/&gt;
*Accessibility – "the matching of people's information and service needs with their needs and preferences in terms of intellectual and sensory engagement with that information or service, and control of it".&lt;ref name="Nevile"&gt;Nevile, Liddy, and Martin Ford. 2007. Location and Access: Issues Enabling Accessibility of Information.  In ''Multimedia Cartography'', ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 471-485. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  A service need could include a driver who cannot take their eyes off the road to study a map display; or a visitor in a foreign country who cannot understand the language of the audible cues of a LBS provider.
*Generalization – "Due to the very small display area of mobile devices mobile maps need to be extremely generalized."  The design should simple, concise and self-evident as possible and should be instantly usable.  "This means to lower the information density following the primacy of relevance over completeness"&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher 2007a"/&gt;
*Scaling – Map display is typically very small, requiring scaling functions to show enough area and information to be useful, but at a large enough scale to adequately show detail
*Relevance – "Presenting as much info as needed and as little as required".&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher 2007b"/&gt;  The information which is "needed" is the content which is effective for the particular spatial context of the user.
*Presentation Form – Multimedia maps provide several display medium options.  The option selected should be the one which best generates the user's mental map.  Besides the visual medium of a graphic map with representative symbols, textual and vocal presentations are options to consider.&lt;ref name="Gartner and Radoczy 2007"&gt;Gartner, Georg. and Verena Radoczky. 2007c.  Maps and LBS – Supporting wayfinding by cartographic means. In Multimedia Cartography, ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 369-382. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Visual Variables – Color is an appropriate primary graphic element when portraying different type or classes of qualitative features.&lt;ref name="Robinson et al 1995"&gt;Robinson, Arthur H., Joel L. Morrison, Phillip C. Muehrcke, A. Jon Kimerling, and Stephen C. Guptill. 1995. ''Elements of Cartography'', 381. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Color can contribute enormously to the usability of products as it assists in differentiating between different screen elements.&lt;ref&gt;Furey, Scott, and Kirk Mitchell. 2007. A Real-World implementation of Multimedia Cartography in LBS: The Whereis Mobile Application Suite. In Multimedia Cartography, ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 399-414. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  High contrast, harmoniously matched colors need to be considered for quick perception and to reduce eye fatigue resulting from the radiant screen display&lt;ref&gt;Wintges, Theodor. 2005. Geodata Communication on Personal Digital Assistants (PDA). In ''Maps and the Internet'', ed. Michael P. Peterson, 397-402. Elsevier Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Metadata – Good metadata provides information to the user on the sources and quality of data being referenced to include reliability, accuracy, and authenticity.  More useful and higher quality metadata for multimedia applications is an omnipresent challenge.  International standards have been developed for geographic information, however, these "need to be extended and linked to information object metadata standards for photographs, videos, imagery, text, and other elements used by multimedia cartography".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, D.R. Fraser, and Tracey P. Lauriault. 2007. Future Directions for Multimedia Cartography. In ''Multimedia Cartography'', ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 505-522. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Navigation Views – The determination on best map views to aid user navigation.  Considerations include: overview maps available at various scales; automatic zoom to larger scale when user is in motion; maintain egocentric map position with north always marked.&lt;ref&gt;Radoczky, Verena. 2007. How to design a pedestrian navigation system for indoor and outdoor environments. In Location Based Services and TeleCartography, ed. Georg Gartner, William Cartwright, and Michael P. Peterson, 301-316. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''specification language''' is a [[formal language]] in [[computer science]] used during [[systems analysis]], [[requirements analysis]] and [[systems design]] to describe a system at a much higher level than a [[programming language]], which is used to produce the executable code for a system.

Specification languages are generally not directly executed. They are meant to describe the ''what'', not the ''how''. Indeed, it is considered as an error if a requirement specification is cluttered with unnecessary implementation detail.

A common fundamental assumption of many specification approaches is that programs are modelled as [[algebra]]ic or [[model theory|model-theoretic]] structures that include a collection of [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of data values together with [[function (mathematics)|functions]] over those sets.  This level of abstraction coincides with the view that the correctness of the input/output behaviour of a program takes precedence over all its other properties.

In the ''property-oriented'' approach to specification (taken e.g. by [[Common Algebraic Specification Language|CASL]]), specifications of programs consist mainly of logical [[axiom]]s, usually in a [[logical system]] in which equality has a prominent role, describing the properties that the functions are required to satisfy - often just by their interrelationship.
This is in contrast to so-called [[model-based specification|model-oriented specification]] in frameworks like [[Vienna Development Method|VDM]] and [[Z notation|Z]], which consist of a simple realization of the required behaviour.

Specifications must be subject to a process of ''refinement'' (the filling-in of implementation detail) before they can actually be implemented. The result of such a refinement process is an executable algorithm, which is either formulated in a programming language, or in an executable subset of the specification language at hand. For example, [[Hartmann pipeline]]s, when
properly applied, may be considered a [[dataflow]] specification which ''is'' directly executable.  Another example is the [[Actor model]] which has no specific application content and must be ''specialized'' to be executable.

An important use of specification languages is enabling the creation of [[Mathematical proof|proof]]s of [[program correctness]] (''see [[Automated theorem prover|theorem prover]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15869">{{About|the pseudolegal theory||Straw man (disambiguation)}}
'''Strawman theory''' (also called the '''Strawman illusion''') is a [[pseudolaw|pseudolegal]] theory prevalent in various movements such as [[sovereign citizen]], [[tax protestor]], [[freeman on the land]], and the [[redemption movement]]. The theory holds that an individual has two personas, one of flesh and the other a separate legal personality (i.e., the "strawman"). The idea is that an individual’s debts, liabilities, taxes and legal responsibilities belong to the strawman rather than the physical individual.{{R|"SPLC1"}} The strawman theory is recognized in law as a scam: The [[FBI]] considers anyone promoting it a likely fraudster,{{R|"FBI"}}. The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) considers it a frivolous argument and fines people that use the theory on their Federal tax returns.{{R|"IRS"}}{{R|"Lii"}}

== About ==

Strawman theory traces its origins to the ancient Roman legal practice of ''[[capitis deminutio]]'' ("decrease of head"), a term used in Roman trials for the [[extinguishment]] of a person's former legal capacity. ''Capitis deminutio minima'' meant a person ceased to belong to a particular family, without loss of liberty or citizenship. ''Capitis deminutio media'' involved loss of citizenship and family, but not liberty. ''Capitis deminutio maxima'' involved loss of family, citizenship and liberty (''i.e.'', a slave or a prisoner of war).{{R|"Mackenzie1862"}} Strawman theory commonly takes the term ''capitis deminutio'' spells it "Capitis Diminutio" and claims ''capitis diminutio maxima'' was represented by an individual’s name being written in capital letters. This led to the idea that individuals had a separate legal personality now called a "strawman".{{R|"Weill"}}

The theory holds that an individual has two personas. One of them is a physical, tangible human being, and the other is the ''legal person'', often referred to as a legal fiction. When a baby is born in the U.S., a birth certificate is issued, and the parents apply for a Social Security number. Sovereigns say the government uses that birth certificate to set up a secret Treasury account which it funds with an amount ranging from $600,000 to $20 million, depending on the particular sovereign belief system. Hence, every newborn's rights are split between those held by the flesh-and-blood baby and the corporate shell account.{{R|"SPLC1"}}

Proponents of the theory believe the evidence is found on the birth certificate. Because many certificates show all capitals to spell out a baby's name, JOHN DOE (under the Strawman theory) is the name of the "straw man," and John Doe is the baby's "real" name. As the child grows, most legal documents will contain capital letters, which means that his state-issued driver's license, his marriage license, his car registration, his criminal court records, his cable TV bill, correspondence from the IRS, etc., pertain to his strawman and not his sovereign identity.{{R|"SPLC1"}} In reality, the use of all capital letters is typically done to make certain statements clear and conspicuous, although this is not always the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/sovereign-citizens-movement|title=Sovereign Citizens Movement|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main use of strawman theory is in escaping and denying debts, liabilities and legal responsibility. Tax protestors, "commercial redemption" and "get out of debt free" scams claim that one’s debts and taxes are the responsibility of the strawman and not of the real person. They back this claim by misreading the legal definition of ''[[person]]''{{R|"Blacks_Person"}} and a misunderstanding of the distinction between a ''[[juridicial person]]''{{R|"Blacks_Jperson"}} and a ''[[natural person]]''.{{R|"Blacks_Nperson"}} In accepted legal theory there is a difference between what is known as a ''natural person'' and that of a ''corporate person''. A ''[[corporate personhood]]'' applies to business, charities, governments and other recognized organisations. Courts recognize human beings as 'persons', not as a legal fiction joined to a flesh and blood human being but as one and the same.{{R|"CanadaLaw"}} They have never recognized a right to distance oneself from one's person, or the ability to opt out of personhood.{{R|"Lovejoy"}}

Believers of the theory also extend it to law and legal responsibilities, claiming that only their strawman is required to adhere to statutory laws. They also claim that legal proceedings in are taken against strawmen rather than persons and when one appears in court they appear as representing their strawman. The justification for this is the false notion that governments cannot force anybody to do anything. A strawman therefore created which the adherent believes he or she is free to command. Proponents cite a misinterpretation of a passage in chapter 39 of [[John, King of England|King John]]'s [[Magna Carta]] stating in part that, "no freeman will be seized, dispossessed of his property, or harmed except by the law of the land”.{{R|"MagnaCarta"}}

Freemen believe that separating from their strawman or refusing to be identified as such enables escape from their various liabilities, responsibilities, and laws. This is typically attempted by denying they are a person in the same way as their strawman, or by writing their name in non-standard ways, using red ink, and placing finger prints on court documents.{{R|"Williams"}}

Judge [[Norman K. Moon]] found such tactics an unconvincing argument in 2013 when an individual named Brandon Gravatt tried to overturn a drug conviction and get out of prison. The case was summarily dismissed by the court.{{R|"Moon"}}

It is impossible to dodge the law by insisting that an individual is different from his or her person. If a court can establish a person's identity, regardless of consent or cooperation, the court will engage in proceedings and sanctions against the individual. This is due to the legal principle known as ''[[Idem sonans]]'' (Latin for "sounding the same") which states that similar sounding names are just as valid in referring to a person.{{R|"Blacks_Idem"}} The earliest legal precedent is R v Davis in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1851.{{R|"ARCHBOLD1867"}}

{{cquote|If two names spelt differently necessarily sound alike, the court may, as matter of law, pronounce them to be idem sonantia; but if they do not necessarily sound alike, the question whether they are idem sonantia is a question of fact for the jury.}}

|''United States v. Washington'' (1996)
|Kurt Washington
|Kurt Washington was charged with two counts of tax evasion. As part of the proceedings, he filed a motion to dismiss the charges on numerous grounds, including that the person charged was a strawman.
|"...the defendant contends that the Indictment must be dismissed because “KURT WASHINGTON,” spelled out in capital letters, is a fictitious name used by the Government to tax him improperly as a business, and that the correct spelling and presentation of his name is “Kurt Washington.” This contention is baseless."{{R|"Washington1996"}}
|-
|''State of Colorado v. Drew''
|Donald James Drew
|Donald Drew was previously convicted after pleading guilty to first degree kidnapping and conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance. Drew then filed a motion to vacate that conviction.
|“The core of defendant’s argument on appeal is that (1) he was born Donald James Drew, and the person charged in this matter was DONALD JAMES DREW; (2) the capitalization of the name created a “Strawman/Stramineous Homo/Ens Legis/ Artificial Person” (artificial person); (3) the artificial person was convicted; (4) he has been incarcerated as surety chattel or security for the artificial person; and (5) he has been denied due process. “Claims so premised are patently frivolous and without merit.”{{R|"Drew"}}
|-

|''Jaeger v. Dubuque County''
|Raymond Jaeger (plaintiff)
|Raymond Jaeger filed a $2M lawsuit against Iowa state law enforcement &amp; Department of Natural Resources, alleging illegal search and seizure. The ruling was made in response to a motion to strike the presented active defense. 
|"The court finds Jaeger’s arguments concerning capitalization otherwise specious. The court routinely capitalizes the names of all parties before this court in all matters, civil and criminal, without any regard to their corporate or individual status...Jaeger’s motions to strike are denied as to improper capitalization."{{R|"Jaeger"}}
|-

|''United States v. Furman''
|William Michael Furman
|William Furman was charged with two counts of conspiracy related to a scheme to defraud a bank and launder money. After being convicted, Furman filed an appeal based on the strawman theory, alleging both a literal misspelling of his name and the "improper" capitalizations typically seen in such arguments.
|"Here, the difference between "Micheal" and "Michael" is a mere transposition of letters with presumably little (if any) auditory significance, and the difference between "WILLIAM MICHAEL FURMAN" and "William Michael Furman" is a mere change of case with absolutely no auditory significance."{{R|"Furman"}}

'''Virginia Durr Moment''' is a phrase originating in developmental psychology which refers to an experience and "triggering event" which can foster the moral development of an individual.  Characteristic of the experience is a serious '''challenge''' to an individual's value system. The book [[Some Do Care]] by developmental psychologists [[William Damon]] and [[Anne Colby]] (who are husband and wife), use the experience of [[Virginia Foster Durr]] to describe this phenomenon.  Although Durr is known as a civil rights activist, in her early years she harbored racial prejudice—a result of her upbringing in the South. When Durr was a student at [[Wellesley College]], her prejudiced value system was first seriously challenged.&lt;ref name="Durr"&gt;{{cite web

On her first night at Wellesley, Durr refused to dine at the same table at which a Negro girl was sitting.  The head of the house explained that the rules of [[Wellesley College]] required Durr to dine with the girl for one month, and that if Durr did not comply, she would have to withdraw from the college.  As Damon and Colby explain "this was the first time Virginia's values had ever been seriously challenged and she stayed awake all night long worrying about the dilemma".  They later go on to quote Durr "That was the first time I became aware that my attitude was considered foolish by some people and that Wellesley College wasn't going to stand for it.  That experience had a tremendous effect on me." (pg, 99, Some Do Care).   The book [[Educating Citizens]]: Preparing America's Undergraduates for Lives of Moral and Civic Responsibility, also describes the developmental significance of Durr's challenge from Wellesley: "[T]he incident lodged in Virginia's memory, creat[ed] a fracture in her convictions about race that contributed to their later destruction" (pg. 3 Educating Citizens). 

A '''Virginia Durr Moment''' refers to those experiences which—when used correctly—foster moral development. A '''Virginia Durr Moment''' presents one with the opportunity for growth via the evolution of one's value system via seriously challenging one's value system in a manner which causes one to reflect on and, as a result of this reflection, reject it in whole or in part.  When used correctly, the signature causal sequence of a '''Virginia Durr Moment''' consists in: serious challenge--&gt;self-reflection--&gt;modification of value system--&gt;moral development.  Ultimately, it is up to the individual to use the Moment to promote growth and further his/her moral development.   In the [[United Kingdom]],  some circles understand [[Paul McCartney]]'s [[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]] as describing the moral development fostered by the '''proper''' usage of a '''Virginia Durr Moment'''.  An individual may experience a '''Virginia Durr Moment''' and fail to use its power, thereby remaining in a condition of developmental stasis and moral immaturity.

A '''zoospore''' is a [[motility|motile]] asexual [[spore]] that uses a [[flagellum]] for [[motion (physics)|locomotion]]. Also called a swarm spore, these spores are created by some [[Protist|protists]], [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] to propagate themselves.

===Flagella types===
Zoospores may possess one or more distinct types of flagella: ''tinsel'' or "decorated", and ''whiplash'', in various combinations.

*''Tinsellated'' (also known as ''straminipilous''&lt;ref name=Webster&amp;Webster/&gt;) flagella have lateral [[Protein filament|filament]]s known as [[mastigonemes]] perpendicular to the main axis which allow for more surface area, and disturbance of the medium, giving it the property of a [[rudder]], that is, the purpose of being used for steering. 
*''Whiplash'' flagella are straight, to power the zoospore through its medium. There is also the 'default' zoospore, which only has the propelling, 'whiplash' flagella.

Both ''tinsel'' and ''whiplash'' flagella beat in a [[sinusoidal]] wave pattern, but when both are present, the tinsel will beat in the opposite direction of the whiplash, to give 2 axes of control of [[motility]].

===Morphological types===
[[File:Zoospores types.svg|thumb|410px|Figure 1. Zoospore types. The arrow indicates direction of movement.]]
In [[eukaryotes]] there are four main types of zoospore,&lt;ref name=Webster&amp;Webster&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=John|title=Introduction to Fungi|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521014830|pages=23-24|edition=3rd|author2=Weber, Roland }}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrated in Fig. 1 at right:
# '''Opisthokont'''. Posterior whiplash flagella, a characteristic of [[Chytridiomycota]], and a proposed uniting trait of the [[Opisthokont]]s, a large clade of eukaryotes containing [[animal]]s and fungi. In most of these, there is a single posterior flagellum (Fig. 1a), but in [[Neocallimastigales]], there are up to 16 (Fig. 1b)
# '''Anisokont.''' Biflagellate zoospores with two whip type flagella of unequal length (Fig. 1c). These are found in some [[Myxogastria|Myxomycota]] and [[Plasmodiophoromycota]].
# Zoospores with a single anterior flagellum (Fig. 1d) of the tinsel type, characteristic of [[Hyphochytriomycetes]]. 
# '''Heterokont'''. Biflagellate zoospores (Fig. 1e, f) with both whiplash and tinsel type flagella attached anteriorly or laterally. These Zoospores are characteristic of [[Oomycota]] and other [[Heterokont]]s.


==Zoosporangium==
A '''zoosporangium''' is the asexual structure ([[sporangium]]) in which the zoospores develop in plants, fungi, or protists (such as the [[Oomycota]])
