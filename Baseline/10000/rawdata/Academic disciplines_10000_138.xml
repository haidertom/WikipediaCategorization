'''20th-century Western painting''' begins with the heritage of late-19th-century painters [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and others who were essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century, [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Matisse's second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflected Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]].

Initially influenced by Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin, and other late-19th-century innovators, [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907; see gallery) Picasso created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] inventions. [[Analytic cubism]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'', was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2014/cubism-the-leonard-lauder-collection ''Cubism: The Leonard A. Lauder Collection'', The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Cubist Epoch"&gt;Douglas Cooper, [https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up "The Cubist Epoch"], pp. 11–221, 232, Phaidon Press Limited 1970 in association with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crystal Cubism]] was a distilled form of Cubism consistent with a shift between 1915 and 1916 towards a strong emphasis on flat surface activity and large overlapping geometric planes, practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[Henri Laurens]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Fernand Léger]] and several other artists into the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987"&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916&amp;ndash;1928'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years between 1910 and the end of World War I and after the heyday of cubism, several movements emerged in Paris. [[Giorgio de Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade, a member of the jury at the [[Salon d'Automne]], where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and Salon d’Automne, where his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], and others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]]. ''[[The Song of Love (Giorgio de Chirico)|Song of Love]]'' (1914) is one of the most famous works by de Chirico and is an early example of the surrealist style, though it was painted ten years before the movement was "founded" by [[André Breton]] in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/works/80419 The Museum of Modern Art, MoMA Highlights, New York, revised 2004, originally published 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first two decades of the 20th century, as Cubism evolved, several other important movements emerged; [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]] ([[Giacomo Balla|Balla]]), [[Abstract art]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]), [[Der Blaue Reiter]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky]] and [[Franz Marc]]), [[Bauhaus]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] and [[Paul Klee|Klee]]), [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], ([[Robert Delaunay|Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka|Kupka]]), [[Synchromism]] ([[Morgan Russell|Russell]] and [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright|Macdonald-Wright]]), [[De Stijl]] ([[Theo van Doesburg|van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]), [[Suprematism]] ([[Malevich]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Tatlin]]), [[Dadaism]] ([[Duchamp]], [[Picabia]] and [[Jean Arp|Arp]]), and [[Surrealism]] ([[Giorgio de Chirico|de Chirico]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]] and [[Max Ernst|Ernst]]). Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from [[Modernist]] [[architecture]] and [[design]], to [[avant-garde]] film, theatre and [[modern dance]] and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from [[photography]] and [[concrete poetry]] to advertising art and fashion. Van Gogh's painting exerted great influence upon 20th-century [[Expressionism]], as can be seen in the work of the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], [[Die Brücke]] (a group led by German painter [[Ernst Kirchner]]), and the Expressionism of [[Edvard Munch]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Chaim Soutine]] and others.

[[Wassily Kandinsky]], a Russian painter, [[printmaker]] and art [[theorist]], is generally considered the first important painter of [[Modern Art|modern]] [[abstract art]]. As an early [[modernist]], in search of new modes of visual expression, and spiritual expression, he theorized—as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]]—that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled (as the example in the above gallery) ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art''. [[Piet Mondrian]]'s art was also related to his spiritual and philosophical studies. In 1908 he became interested in the theosophical movement launched by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] in the late 19th century. Blavatsky believed that it was possible to attain a knowledge of nature more profound than that provided by empirical means, and much of Mondrian's work for the rest of his life was inspired by his search for that spiritual knowledge. Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Swedish painter [[Hilma af Klint]], Russian painter [[Kazimir Malevich]], and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]]. [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism).&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; His later works were more abstract, reminiscent of Paul Klee. His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color, and a clear love of experimentation of both depth and tone. At the invitation of Kandinsky, Delaunay and his wife the artist [[Sonia Delaunay]], joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of abstract artists, in 1911, and his art took a turn to the abstract. Still other important pioneers of abstract painting include [[Czechs|Czech]] painter, [[František Kupka]] as well as American artists [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright]] and [[Morgan Russell]] who, in 1912, founded [[Synchromism]], an art movement that closely resembles [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Robert.

Les Fauves (French for ''The Wild Beasts'') were early-20th-century painters, experimenting with freedom of expression through color. The name was given, humorously and not as a compliment, to the group by art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]]. [[Fauvism]] was a short-lived and loose grouping of artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. Fauvists made the subject of the painting easy to read and exaggerated perspectives. A prescient prediction of the Fauves was expressed in 1888 by [[Paul Gauguin]] to [[Paul Sérusier]]:

''"How do you see these trees? They are yellow. So, put in yellow; this shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure [[ultramarine]]; these red leaves? Put in [[vermilion]]."''

The leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]]—friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers. Ultimately Matisse became the ''yang'' to Picasso's ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;''The "Wild Beasts" Fauvism and its Affinities,'' [[John Elderfield]], Museum of Modern Art 1976, {{ISBN|0-87070-638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fauvism, as a movement, had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907. The Fauves had only three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse, ''The Green Line'' (above), caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight; art as a decoration was his purpose and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], [[André Derain]] went to London and produced a series of paintings like ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' (above) in the Fauvist style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Rosenthal (publisher)|Tom Rosenthal]], reviewing Derain's London paintings on show at the Courtauld Gallery, ''The Independent'' 4 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MunchDerToddesMarat1907.JPG|thumb|left|[[Edvard Munch]], ''Death of Marat I'' (1907), an example of [[Expressionism]]]]
By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, soon it was replaced by [[Cubism]] on
the critics radar screen as the latest new development in [[Contemporary Art]] of the time.
In 1907 [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in La Falange, said, "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;''Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism'' William Rubin, published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, copyright 1989, {{ISBN|0-87070-676-4}} p.348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Der Blaue Reiter was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with [[Die Brücke]], a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members of [[Die Brücke]] were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Later members included [[Max Pechstein]], [[Otto Mueller]] and others. This was a seminal group, which in due course had a major impact on the evolution of modern art in the 20th century and created the style of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name=bruckemuseumbrucke&gt;[http://www.bruecke-museum.de/englbleyl.htm "The Artists' Association 'Brücke'"], Brücke Museum. Retrieved 7 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer ''Portrait of [[Alexander Sakharoff]],'' 1909 is in the gallery above, [[Marianne von Werefkin]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others founded the [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting ''Last Judgement'' from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved.

The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. It is also claimed that the name could have derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses and Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the colour of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 Der Blaue Reiter, Tate Glossary] retrieved August 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics encompassing several important and related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the [[avant-garde]] art being made in Western, Eastern, and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Expressionist styles are related to those of both Surrealism and Symbolism and are each uniquely and somewhat eccentrically personal. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Brücke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of [[Expressionist]] and Symbolist painters. Artists as interesting and diverse as [[Marc Chagall]], whose painting ''[[I and the Village]],'' (above) tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Käthe Schmidt Kollwitz]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and some of the Americans abroad like [[Marsden Hartley]], and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as an intense [[Surrealist]] [[sculptor]], he made intense expressionist paintings as well.
In the USA during the period between World War I and World War II painters tended to go to Europe for recognition. [[Modernist]] artists like [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], created reputations abroad. While [[Patrick Henry Bruce]],&lt;ref&gt;Agee and Rose, 1979, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; created [[cubist]] related paintings in Europe, both [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Gerald Murphy]] made paintings that were early inspirations for American [[pop art]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2007/08/06/070806craw_artworld_schjeldahl New Yorker article, accessed online November 11, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Craven, ''American Art: History and Culture,'' p.464.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm accessed online August 28, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017051233/http://jasonkaufman.com/articles/stuart_davis_american_modernist.htm |date=October 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marsden Hartley]] experimented with [[expressionism]]. During the 1920s photographer [[Alfred Stieglitz]] exhibited [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[Alfred Henry Maurer]], [[Charles Demuth]], [[John Marin]] and other artists including European Masters [[Henri Matisse]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Pablo Picasso]], at his New York City gallery ''[[the 291]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/modart_2.shtm National Gallery of Art, retrieved November 11, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe masters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] continued developing their narrative styles independent of any movement.

[[Marcel Duchamp]] came to international prominence in the wake of the New York City [[Armory Show]] in 1913 where his ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase]]'' became the cause celebre. He subsequently created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''[[Large Glass]]'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp (who was soon to renounce artmaking for [[chess]]) became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zürich, Switzerland]], during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in [[art]] through [[anti-art]] cultural works. [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several [[Dadaists]] are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Hopkins|title=Dada and Surrealism: A Very Short Introduction|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280254-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 [[André Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]].'' The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly,'' (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the [[Dada]] movement through 1919 in [[Zürich]] and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[René Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. [[Joan Miró]]'s ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' of 1923–1924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Miró's first [[Surrealist]] [[masterpiece]].&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. "[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923–1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=2008-09-25 }}". [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] display caption. Retrieved on 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The more abstract [[Joan Miró]], [[Jean Arp]], [[André Masson]], and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.

Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in [[Latin America]], the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works.

Dalí and [[René Magritte|Magritte]] created some of the most widely recognized images of the movement. The 1928/1929 painting ''This Is Not A Pipe'' by Magritte is the subject of a [[Michel Foucault]] 1973 book, ''This is not a Pipe'' (English edition, 1991), that discusses the painting and its paradox. Dalí joined the group in 1929, and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.

Surrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth by stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, in order to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, and perception, sometimes evoking empathy from the viewer, sometimes laughter and sometimes outrage and bewilderment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.bnf.fr/fr/14451967/andre_breton_manifeste_du_surrealisme/ André Breton, ''Manifeste du surréalisme'', various editions], BnF, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;

1931 marked a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: in one example liquid shapes become the trademark of Dalí, particularly in his ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', which features the image of watches that sag as if they are melting. Evocations of time and its compelling mystery and absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79018''The Persistence of Memory''] in the MoMA Online Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of this style – a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological – came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the [[Modernism|modernist]] period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be "made whole with one's individuality."&lt;ref&gt;'André Breton, ''Manifestoes of Surrealism'', transl. Richard Seaver and Helen R. Lane (Ann Arbor, 1971), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Durozoi, History of the Surrealist Movement, transl. Alison Anderson (Chicago, 2002), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Max Ernst studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings, such as ''Murdering Airplane'' (1920), may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]]''. The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=4133&amp;searchid=19833&amp;tabview=text From the Tate Modern]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s [[André Masson]]'s work was enormously influential in helping the young artist [[Joan Miró]] find his roots in the new Surrealist painting. Miró acknowledged in letters to his dealer [[Pierre Matisse]] the importance of Masson as an example to him in his early years in Paris.

Long after personal, political and professional tensions have fragmented the Surrealist group into thin air and ether, Magritte, Miró, Dalí and the other Surrealists continue to define a visual program in the arts. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Méret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Grégoire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]] among others.

During the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], the European art scene was characterized by Surrealism, late Cubism, the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], Dada, [[Neue Sachlichkeit]], and Expressionism; and was occupied by masterful [[modernist]] color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]].

[[American Scene painting]] and the [[Social Realism]] and [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world in the USA. Artists like [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent. In Latin America besides the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Rufino Tamayo]] from Mexico, the [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] with [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] paintings by [[Frida Kahlo]] began a renaissance of the arts for the region, with a use of color and historic, and political messages. [[Frida Kahlo]]'s Symbolist works also relate strongly to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. The psychological drama in many of Kahlo's self-portraits (above) underscore the vitality and relevance of her paintings to artists in the 21st century.

In Germany [[Neue Sachlichkeit]] ("New Objectivity") emerged as [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others associated with the [[Berlin Secession]] politicized their paintings. The work of these artists grew out of expressionism, and was a response to the political tensions of the [[Weimar Republic]], and was often sharply satirical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=193 Neue Sachlichkeit, Tate glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public for his 1933 mural, ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'', in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Lenin]] and other [[communist]] imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff. The film ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' includes a dramatization of the controversy. [[Frida Kahlo]] (Rivera's wife's) works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are [[Self portrait|self-portraits]], which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds. Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her paintings' bright colors and dramatic symbolism. [[Christian]] and [[Jewish]] themes are often depicted in her work as well; she combined elements of the classic religious Mexican tradition—which were often bloody and violent—with [[surrealist]] renderings. While her paintings are not overtly Christian—she was an avowed communist—they certainly contain elements of the macabre Mexican Christian style of religious paintings.

During the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to [[Surrealism]], including [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. University of Edinburgh Press. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] town of [[Gernika]] was the scene of the "[[Bombing of Gernika]]" by the Condor Legion of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque Government and the Spanish Republican government. The town was devastated, though the Biscayan assembly and the Oak of Gernika survived. Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.

In its final form, ''Guernica'' is an immense black and white, 3.5 metre (11&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and 7.8 metre (23&amp;nbsp;ft) wide mural painted in oil. The mural presents a scene of death, violence, brutality, suffering, and helplessness without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint in black and white contrasts with the intensity of the scene depicted and invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/cubism/Pablo-Picasso.html Pablo Picasso – Biography, Quotes &amp; Paintings], retrieved 14 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Picasso painted the mural sized painting called ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' in protest of the bombing. The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then Scandinavia, then London in 1938 and finally in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. The painting went on a tour of museums throughout the US until its final return to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City where it was exhibited for nearly thirty years. Finally in accord with [[Pablo Picasso]]'s wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.

During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, through the years of World War II American art was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]] (as seen above) in the work of [[Grant Wood]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and several others. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a painting by [[Edward Hopper]] that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. It is currently in the collection of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The scene was inspired by a [[diner]] (since demolished) in [[Greenwich Village]], Hopper's home neighborhood in [[Manhattan]]. Hopper began painting it immediately after the attack on [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by Grant Wood from 1930. Portraying a [[pitchfork]]-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting, like [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Christopher Morley]], they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the onset of the Great Depression, the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

===Abstract expressionism===

[[Image:No. 5, 1948.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Jackson Pollock]], ''[[No. 5, 1948]],'' [[Abstract Expressionism]]]]
[[File:No 61 Mark Rothko.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mark Rothko]], ''[[No. 61 (Rust and Blue)]],'' 1953, 115 cm × 92 cm (45 in × 36 in). [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]]]]
The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], Surrealism, [[Joan Miró]], Cubism, [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s [[The Art of This Century Gallery]], as well as other factors.

Post-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]]. It is seen as combining the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]] and Synthetic Cubism. Abstract expressionism, [[Action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].

Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for Abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]]. Another important ear&lt;nowiki&gt;ly m&lt;/nowiki&gt;anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the "all over" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

Additionally, abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. As seen above in the gallery ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'', [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]]'', [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV'', [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1][[National Gallery of Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street,'' 1950 as with [[Jackson Pollock]] and other Abstract Expressionists, was labelled an [[Action Painting|action painter]] because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] (gallery) can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and [[Color field|Color field painting]].
[[Image:Dugmore-5313 hi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Edward Dugmore]], ''Untitled'', 1954, 84 x 51 inches, San Francisco Bay area school of [[abstract expressionism]]]]
Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early twentieth century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or of the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. An exception might be the drip paintings of Pollock.
Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[Social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]] but also by the [[Socialist Realism|Social Realists]] of Mexico such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of those painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early 1940s at galleries in New York like [[The Art of This Century Gallery]]. The late 1940s through the mid-1950s ushered in the [[McCarthy era]]. It was after World War II and a time of political conservatism and extreme artistic [[censorship]] in the United States. Some people have conjectured that since the subject matter was often totally abstract, Abstract expressionism became a safe strategy for artists to pursue this style. Abstract art could be seen as apolitical. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders. However those theorists are in the minority. As the first truly original school of painting in America, Abstract expressionism demonstrated the vitality and creativity of the country in the post-war years, as well as its ability (or need) to develop an aesthetic sense that was not constrained by the European standards of beauty.

Although Abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the San Francisco Bay area. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an [[all-over painting|"all-over"]] approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of [[Action painting]], while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the Color Field painters. Many other artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]], [[Nicolas Carone]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.

During the 1950s, Color Field painting initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Adolph Gottlieb]]. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. [[Art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early to mid-1960s, ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]] – all moving in a new direction. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. In ''Mountains and Sea,'' from 1952, a seminal work of [[Colorfield painting]] by [[Helen Frankenthaler]] the artist used the stain technique for the first time.

In Europe there was the continuation of Surrealism, Cubism, Dada and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to Abstract expressionism) and [[Art Informel|Informalism]] took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Pierre Soulages]] among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.

Eventually abstract painting in America evolved into movements such as [[Neo-Dada]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism]] and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. As a response to the tendency toward abstraction imagery emerged through various new movements, notably [[Pop art]].

===Realism, Landscape, Figuration, Still-Life, Cityscape===
[[File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Hopper]], ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942), [[Cityscape]]]]
During the 1930s through the 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Abstract Expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction allowing imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery; practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], [[Elaine de Kooning]] and others. Along with [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges Braque]], and other 20th-century masters. The figurative work of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Lucian Freud]] [[Andrew Wyeth]] and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism. One of the most well-known images in 20th-century American art is Wyeth's painting, ''[[Christina's World]]'', currently in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. It depicts a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at and crawling towards a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house. This [[tempera]] work, done in a [[realist visual arts|realist]] style, is nearly always on display at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York.&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78455''Christina's World''] in the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] Online Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arshile Gorky]]'s portrait of what may be his friend [[Willem de Kooning]] (left) is an example of the evolution of [[Abstract Expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.

After World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. In 1952 [[Michel Tapié]] authored the book ''Un Autre art'' which gave name and voice to [[Art Informel|Informalism]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s [[Jean Dubuffet|Dubuffet]] (who was always a figurative artist), and [[Nicolas de Staël|de Staël]], abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël 's work was quickly recognised within the post-war art world, and he became one of the most influential artists of the 1950s. His return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël 's late work – in particular his thinned, and diluted oil on canvas abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. [[Nicolas de Staël]]'s bold and intensely vivid color in his last paintings predict the direction of much of contemporary painting that came after him including Pop art of the 1960s.

[[File:Greencocacola.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Andy Warhol]], 1962, [[Pop Art]]]]

[[Pop art]] in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s set the table for Pop art in America. In New York City during the mid-1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works and the work of Larry Rivers, were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion and the combining of mundane materials into their work. The innovations of Johns' specific use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the [[American Flag]]; Rivers paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]], and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]] gave rise to a radical new movement in [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as Pop art.

Pop art is exemplified by artists: [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein used oil and [[Magna paint]] in his best known works, such as ''[[Drowning Girl]]'' (1963), which was appropriated from the lead story in [[DC Comics]]' ''Secret Hearts'' #83. (''Drowning Girl'' now is in the collection of [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]].&lt;ref name="rlf-Hendrickson31"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickson| 1988| p= 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Also featuring thick outlines, bold colors and [[Ben-Day dots]] to represent certain colors, as if created by photographic reproduction. Lichtenstein would say of his own work: Abstract Expressionists "put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'' the first major Pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. Sidney Janis mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery at 15 E. 57th Street. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in the fall of 1962 a historically important and ground-breaking ''[[New Painting of Common Objects]]'' exhibition of Pop art, curated by [[Walter Hopps]] at the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] sent shock waves across the Western United States. ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' (sometimes referred to as ''32 Campbell's Soup Cans'') is the title of an [[Andy Warhol]] [[work of art]] that was produced in 1962. It consists of thirty-two canvases, each measuring 20&amp;nbsp;inches in height x 16&amp;nbsp;inches in width (50.8 x 40.6&amp;nbsp;cm) and each consisting of a painting of a [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soup]] can—one of each [[canned soup]] variety the company offered at the time. The individual paintings were produced with a semi-mechanised [[silkscreen]] process, using a non-[[painterly]] style. They helped usher in [[Pop art]] as a major [[art movement]] that relied on themes from [[popular culture]]. These works by [[Andy Warhol]] are repetitive and they are made in a non-painterly commercial manner.

Earlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected Abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.&lt;ref&gt;Topics in American Art since 1945, ''Pop art the words'', p.119-122, by [[Lawrence Alloway]], copyright 1975 by W.W.Norton and Company, NYC {{ISBN|0-393-04401-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of [[David Hockney]] whose paintings emerged from England during the 1960s like ''[[A Bigger Splash]],'' and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], are considered seminal examples in the movement.

While in the downtown scene in New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of Pop art. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront, and the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. Later [[Leo Castelli]] exhibited other American artists including the bulk of the careers of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and his use of Benday dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction and seen in ordinary [[comic books]] and in paintings like ''Drowning Girl'', 1963, in the gallery above. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and Pop Artists like [[Alex Katz]] (who became known for his parodies of portrait photography and suburban life), [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and the others.

During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Color Field]] painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of [[Abstract expressionism]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with [[Outsider art|Art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L’Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949](=engl in: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Court les rues,'' 1962, by [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[New Realism]], allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like [[Pop art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] (a prime example is Diebenkorn's ''Cityscape I,(Landscape No. 1),'' 1963, Oil on canvas, 60 1/4 x 50 1/2 inches, collection: [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]), and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]]. The [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1,'' 1963 is a typical example were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in [[California]]. Although throughout the 20th-century painters continued to practice [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and use imagery, practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[Milton Avery]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], and others. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[John Baeder]], and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists, many of them affiliated with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of writers, including [[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], and [[James Schuyler]]. Many of his paintings were set in or around the family summer house on [[Great Spruce Head Island, Maine]].

Neo-Dada is a movement that started 1n the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. Featuring the emergence of combined manufactured items, with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting. This trend in art is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others were important pioneers of both abstraction and Pop Art; creating new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Colorfield painting]], his work can serve as a bridge between [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Colorfield painting]], and [[Minimal Art]]. Two influential teachers [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]] introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. [[Josef Albers]] is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas. Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists. His own paintings form the foundation of both [[hard-edge painting]] and Op art.


[[Josef Albers]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]],&lt;ref&gt;Terry Fenton, online essay about [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[acrylic paint]], [http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials] accessed 30 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Larry Zox]], and [[Al Held]] are artists closely associated with [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well. [[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], Neil Williams, David Novros, Paul Mogenson, are examples of artists associated with [[Minimalism]] and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, minimalists, and [[Hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The [[Bykert Gallery]], and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Minimalism]] and [[shaped canvas]] painting in New York City during the 1960s.

In 1965, an exhibition called ''[[The Responsive Eye]]'', curated by William C. Seitz, was held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in New York City. The works shown were wide ranging, encompassing the Minimalism of [[Frank Stella]], the Op art of Larry Poons, the work of [[Alexander Liberman]], alongside the masters of the Op Art movement: [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Bridget Riley]] and others. The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships. Op art, also known as optical art, is a style present in some paintings and other works of art that use [[optical illusion]]s. Op art is also closely akin to [[geometric abstraction]] and [[hard-edge painting]]. Although sometimes the term used for it is perceptual abstraction.
Op art is a method of painting concerning the interaction between illusion and picture plane, between understanding and seeing.&lt;ref&gt;John Lancaster. ''Introducing Op Art'', London: BT Batsford Ltd, 1973, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Op art works are abstract, with many of the better known pieces made in only black and white. When the viewer looks at them, the impression is given of movement, hidden images, flashing and vibration, patterns, or alternatively, of swelling or warping.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Color Field painting clearly pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Color Field painting is related to [[Post-painterly abstraction]], [[Suprematism]], Abstract Expressionism, [[Hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]].

Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists made references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image. [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]] along with [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Morris Louis]] and several others was a member of the [[Washington Color School]] painters who began to create [[Color Field painting]]s in Washington, D.C. during the 1950s and 1960s, ''Black, Grey, Beat''is a large vertical stripe painting and typical of Gene Davis's work.

[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, [[minimalism|minimalists]], and [[Hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. From 1960 [[Frank Stella]] produced paintings in [[aluminum]] and [[copper]] paint and are his first works using [[shaped canvas]]es (canvases in a shape other than the traditional rectangle or square), often being in L, N, U or T-shapes. These later developed into more elaborate designs, in the ''Irregular Polygon'' series (67), for example. Also in the 1960s, Stella began to use a wider range of colors, typically arranged in straight or curved lines. Later he began his ''Protractor Series'' (71) of paintings, in which [[circle|arcs]], sometimes overlapping, within square borders are arranged side-by-side to produce full and half circles painted in rings of concentric color. ''Harran II,'' 1967, is an example of the ''Protractor Series''. These paintings are named after circular cities he had visited while in the Middle East earlier in the 1960s. The Irregular Polygon canvases and Protractor series further extended the concept of the [[shaped canvas]].

The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for Color Field painting, [[shaped canvas]] painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against abstract expressionisms' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.

Another related movement of the late 1960s, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Connecticut 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web] retrieved June 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;[[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Postminimalism]] (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of [[Artforum]] in 1969)&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt; sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. Postminimalism often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to Dada and Surrealism is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"/&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[Conceptual Art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth Art]], [[Video]], [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]], along with the continuation of [[Fluxus]], Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, [[Hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal Art]], Op art, Pop art, [[Photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[Contemporary Art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. The New Art: It's Way, Way Out, Newsweek 29 July 1968: pp.3,55–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction,'' exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lyrical Abstraction]] shares similarities with Color Field painting and Abstract Expressionism especially in the freewheeling usage of paint – texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in Abstract Expressionism and Color Field painting. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from Abstract Expressionism and Action Painting of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in Action Painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in [[Lyrical Abstraction]] as exemplified by the 1971 [[Ronnie Landfield]] painting ''Garden of Delight'' (above), there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.
During the 1960s and 1970s artists as powerful and influential as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Al Held]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like [[Brice Marden]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Ronnie Landfield]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Dan Christensen]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], [[Mino Argento]] and dozens of others produced vital and influential paintings.

===Monochrome, minimalism, postminimalism===

Kelly was a pioneer of [[hard-edge painting]] in the 1940s and 1950s.]]

Artists such as [[Larry Poons]]—whose work related to Op Art with his emphasis on dots, ovals and after-images bouncing across color fields—[[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Kenneth Noland]], Ralph Humphrey, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Robert Ryman]] had also begun to explore stripes, [[monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge]] formats from the late 1950s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism Britannica.com], "Minimalism"&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in Minimalism to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal—as demonstrated by [[Robert Mangold]], who understood the concept of the shape of the canvas and its relationship to ''objecthood''—there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of Minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values.  He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including Jasper Johns, Dan Flavin and Lee Bontecou. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman,  Jim Long, ''George Ortman''], The Brooklyn Rail, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

In a much more general sense, one might find European roots of Minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s painters in the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the movement DeStijl, in [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivists]] and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. American painters such as [[Brice Marden]] and [[Cy Twombly]] show a clear European influence in their ''pure'' abstraction, minimalist painting of the 1960s. Ronald Davis polyurethane works from the late 1960s pay homage to the ''Broken Glass'' of [[Marcel Duchamp]]''.

This movement was heavily criticised by high modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some anxious critics thought Minimalist art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of Minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried (Art Critic)|Michael Fried]], a Greenbergian critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the Minimalist work of art, particularly Minimalist sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's participation in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of Minimal art.

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art: "The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature."

Still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by [[monochrome painting]] and [[hard-edge painting]] inspired by Ad Reinhardt, [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], and [[Ellsworth Kelly]]. Artists as diverse as Agnes Martin, Al Held, [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, [[minimal art]], hard-edge painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in [[abstract expressionism]], [[neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and postminimal painting.

===Neo-expressionism===
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;

In the late 1960s the [[abstract expressionist]] painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery. His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' 1973, seen above in the gallery is an example of Guston's final and conclusive return to representation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/philip-guston-1231 Philip Guston, the Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/movement-neo-expressionism.htm the art story, neo=expressionism]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 Tate online glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 1990s the [[Stuckists]], a group that emerged late in 1990s respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination. All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]]. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries. This type of art continues in popularity into the 21st century, even after the art crash of the late 1980s.

During the late 1970s in the United States painters who began working with invigorated surfaces and who returned to imagery like [[Susan Rothenberg]] gained in popularity, especially as seen above in paintings like ''Horse 2,'' 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Plagens, Peter. ''A Matter of Horsepower'', ''Newsweek'', Retrieved June 9, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s American artists like [[Eric Fischl]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] (who began as a [[graffiti artist]]), [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], and Italian painters like [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], among others defined the idea of [[Neo-expressionism]] in America.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian and John Glaves-Smith. ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art''. Oxford University Press (2009), p. 503-504&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner), in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colours and banal colour harmonies. The veteran painters [[Philip Guston]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with slightly younger artists like [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Damien Hirst]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Keith Haring]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5508">[[Rao Sahib]] '''Abraham Pandithar''' ({{lang-ta|ஆபிரகாம் பண்டிதர்}}, 2 August 1859 – 31 August 1919) was a [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[musicologist]], composer and a traditional medicine practitioner from [[Tirunelveli]], who is celebrated for his patronage of numerous Tamil musicians and his influential studies concerning the origins and evolution of traditional Tamil music.

==Biography==
Abraham Pandithar was born in Sambavar Vadakarai near Surandai in [[Tirunelveli district]] to a Tamil [[Christian]] family, the son of Muthusamy Pandithar and Annammal of the [[Pandithar Maruthuvar caste]]. He studied at the CVES Normal Teachers Training School at [[Dindigal]] and in 1876, became a teacher in the same college. He belonged to a family of doctors and became interested in [[Siddha medicine]].

In 1879, he went to Suruli hills to research herbs growing there. There he met the [[Siddha]]r Karunandhar and became his student. After completing his studies he went to [[Tanjore]] and worked as a Tamil teacher in Lady Napier Girls School. His wife Gnanavadivu Ponnammal  was the headmistress in the same school. In 1890, he left his teaching job to do research on medicine full-time. He started a farm outside Tanjore for growing medicinal plants. He named it Karanandhapuram after his teacher. It was called as Pandithar thottam (Pandithar's farm) by the locals. He also started a clinic - the  Karunanidhi Medical Hall at his residence in Tanjore. In 1909, the colonial government awarded him the "Rao Sahib" title. In 1911, Gnanavadivu died and Pandithar married Bhagyammal.&lt;ref name=hindu1/&gt;

The publication of ''[[Silapathikaram]]'' by [[U. V. Swaminatha Iyer]] in 1892, made Pandithar interested in [[Ancient Tamil music|Tamil music]] and he started studying it. He learnt traditional music as he is part of the Navithar Community, from Sadayandi Bhattar and western classical music from Tanjore A. G. Pichaimuthu pillai. He did extensive research on the origins and form of Tamil music. He established the ''Sangeetha Vidhyalaya Mahajana Sangam'' - a music association and organised six music conferences during 1912–1914. In 1917, he published his research into Tamil music as ''Karunamirdha Sagaram'', a 1346-page book, that remains a seminal work in the field till today. He also published ''Karunamirdha Sagara Thirattu'' - a collection of Tamil practice songs (musicians of that period trained using [[Telugu language|Telugu]] songs). He also translated several ''[[Keerthana]]is'' into Tamil. He attended the All India Music Conference held at Baroda in 1916 and presented his research there.&lt;ref name=hindu1&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother of all Music Conferences|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2005/12/16/stories/2005121603150300.htm|accessdate=14 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=16 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Renowned work of Tamil scholar lauded|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/01/stories/2007090160960600.htm|accessdate=14 March 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|date=1 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a prolific composer and composed several kritis in chaste ragas in praise of [[Jesus Christ]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=V.

== Death ==
Pandithar died in 1919.

== Descendants ==
His family continued his research -  His son Varaguna Pandiyan Pandithar wrote the Tamil musical research work Paanarkaivazhi and his daughter Maragathavalli Duraipandian Pandithar completed part 2 of ''Karunamirdha Sagaram''. His grandson D. A.

'''''Angst und Vorurteil: AIDS-Ängste als Gegenstand der Vorurteilsforschung''''' (German: "Fear and prejudice: AIDS paranoia from the view of scientific prejudice studies") is a sociology book written by German sociologist, ethnologist, and sexologist [[Gisela Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg]] that was first published in 1989.

== Background ==

In 1988, due to her former scientific achievements Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg was appointed member of the parliamentary inquiry commission ''Enquetekommission AIDS'' that was formed in order to research into the disease's social, cultural, legal, and public health care consequences and challenges. While the commission's 1990 final report focussed entirely on bio-chemical epidemiology and prevention, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's influence was incorporated mostly into its 1989 preliminary report dealing rather with sociological, cultural, and legal aspects.

The book ''Angst und Vorurteil - AIDS-Ängste als Gegenstand der Vorurteilsforschung'' was based on the work of the ''Enquetekommission AIDS'', as well as Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's own final report brought forth in parliamentary hearings and towards the [[Cabinet Kohl III|Helmut Kohl administration]].

== Content ==

=== ''Leibfeindlichkeit'', natural disasters, and epidemics ===

In ''Angst und Vorurteil'', Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg on the one hand supplements the structural history of Western ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' (repression of sensuality) she related at a fuller scope in ''[[Tabu Homosexualität]]'' before, by pointing out in ''Angst und Vorurteil'' further aspects she had already brushed on in ''Der pädophile Impuls'' four years earlier. According to ''Angst und Vorurteil'', an important derivational motivation of ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' was an intense connotation that was at first numinous, then mythological, then religious in nature, of sexual deviance with divine punishments for it, particularly natural disasters and epidemics. An obvious, exemplary line originated from the [[Old Testament]] where [[leprosy]] was God's just answer to sensual sins, especially sins of the flesh; by the Medieval Age, the [[Black Death]] had taken the former place of leprosy in ecclesiastical dogma. Just when early science dawned, [[syphilis]] came from across the ocean to the Old World, perpetuating the ancient cultural notions repressive towards sensuality by seemingly confirming the idea that lose sexual morals resulted in severe epidemics of fatal diseases.

Western society's own cultural misconception of sexuality only supported perpetuation of these ancient cultural notions, as this misconception saw sexuality as purely procreative and thus purely penetrative in nature, whereas any non-penetrative sexual activity, while actually running a lower risk of STD infection, was regarded as deviant and sinful. Thereby Western science was barred from even just slightly disposing all the religious and cultural superstitions pertaining to sexuality that the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] did away with in most any other field beside sexuality. Finally, the next significant loosening of traditional Western mores occurring after WWII, caused by penicillin and the anti-baby pill, was rolled back effectively in quite a similar reactionary process when HIV and AIDS arrived during the early 1980s, with quite similar cultural patterns as before of rationalizing derivations as ideological justifications, such as moral panics and witch hunts concerning factual or putative sexual minorities aka deviants.

=== Prejudice studies, sexuality, and ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' ===

On the other hand, in ''Angst und Vorurteil'' Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg gives a thorough, comprehensive description of post-WWII scientific prejudice studies, particularly regarding the re-inforcement of traditional Western ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' (prejudices directed against factual or putative sexual deviance) triggered by HIV, and chronicles the field's academic history from its roots.

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's understanding of prejudice therein is largely informed by [[Frankfurt School|Critical Theory]] and its concept of the ''[[Authoritarian personality]]'' (also see ''[[Right-wing authoritarianism]]''), but also incorporates, among other schools of prejudice studies, ''[[Labeling theory]]'' by [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Howard S. Becker]], ''[[Social identity theory]]'' by [[Henri Tajfel]] and [[John Turner (psychologist)|John Turner]], ''[[Frustration aggression theory|Frustration-Aggression hypothesis]]'' by [[John Dollard]] and [[Neal E. Miller]], ''[[observational learning|Social learning theory]]'' by [[Albert Bandura]], as well as ''[[dispositif]]'' and ''[[discourse analysis]]'' by [[Michel Foucault]].

=== Prejudice's main function: In-group cohesiveness ===

As one important pattern of prejudice can be named, according to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg, that prejudice's main social function is creating and maintaining the in-group's [[group cohesiveness|social cohesiveness]], united against a constructed foe or enemy identity (''Feindbild'') tagged on marginalized out-groups that are thus perceived as threatening and must be overcome by harsh measures correlating to how outrageous and abominable these minorities are perceived by the majority in-group.

Without such a negative out-group identity, there is no cohesiveness for the majority in-group which itself is based on the Authoritarian personality type, and indeed the positive in-group identity is only created as a response to the constructed negative out-group identity. The majority in-group conceives itself, its own role and identity, as direct opposite of these marginalized out-groups down to every detail; filthy sinners and other outsiders or aliens, who are basically regarded as evil incarnate and often tagged with dehumanizing, partly zoomorphic attributes, are contrasted with good, decent, law-abiding citizens, as the most dichotomous, yet most basic socio-cultural and socio-psychological distinction in Western and [[Proto-Indo-European society|Indo-European]] culture and civilization since the beginning of the [[Iron Age]].

Regarding the dehumanizing and zoomorphic attributes given to social out-groups, it is important to remember the influential cultural precursor quintessentially found in the archetype of the non-human, demonic, shape-shifting ''nithing'' fiend from ''Tabu Homosexualität'' (see [[Tabu Homosexualität|the book's own article]]).

=== The Authoritarian personality ===

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg links this in-group vs. out-group conflict model closely with neo-Freudian psychology, particularly the psychological apparatus of [[Id, ego, and super-ego]] and the defense mechanism of [[psychological projection]], in its socio-cultural interpretation of the Authoritarian personality type brought forth by Critical Theory. Early on, from earliest childhood, people's socialization consists of internalizing the difference of "good" and "evil" impulses, resulting in a psychological apparatus where those impulses labeled as the most "evil" and "filthiest" are separated from conscious ego by work of the super-ego consisting of the most forcefully internalized social values, and by means of [[psychological repression]] the repressed impulses turn into the unconscious Id.

The more forceful and restrictive the socialization, the more authoritarian a super-ego will result, and the behavioral result of internalizing these restrictive traditional values is at first learning to masochistically deny and repress certain impulses, then later on the continuously pent-up frustration is acted out as sadistically passing on these restrictive values on to others, which in case of the in-group's intention to inflict in-group values upon a minority out-group as a whole shows as discrimination all over [[Allport's Scale]].

Providing convenient targets for the Authoritarian personality's outlet, the negative out-group identity is created as a convenient [[psychological projection|projection screen]] made out of the repressed impulses; lowering the inhibition threshold for all kinds of discrimination including structural violence and even physical violence, the minority out-group is tagged with all kinds of negative attributes, partly dehumanizing, partly pathologizing, partly such mental and behavioral attributes that are factually harmful.

This process only works because the out-group is defined by not only imaginary or constructed attributes, but also by its factual attributes. The conscious mind of Authoritarian in-group members cannot even distinguish on the one hand between the out-group's factual and imaginary attributes, perceiving either as equally real. On the other hand, these in-group members are mentally incapable of distinguishing between any of the constructed imaginary attributes, as out-group members stereotypically appear to them as altogether and nothing but pathological, menacing, dangerous, abominable, and criminal, or, in a word, plain ''evil''.

=== Prejudice resembles intrusive thoughts, discrimination is OCD ===

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg thus defines Authoritarian prejudice as socially learned manifest, recurring [[intrusive thoughts]] (''Zwangsvorstellungen'') that may spill over into [[Allport's Scale]] discrimination, including violent hate crimes, as a form of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive behavior]] (''Zwangshandlung''; also see [[Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]]). Due to what Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg terms "distorted perception" (''verzerrte Wahrnehmung'', relating to Altemeyer's ''compartmentalized thinking'') of constructed social reality, the prejudiced aggressor regards themselves as a rectifying, maybe curing agent, as an upholder of "natural order" and "society", and/or as protector of people they perceive as "victims" of the discriminated.

=== The Authoritarian and numinous characteristics of prejudice ===

Although ethnocentric prejudice is often pseudo-scientifically rationalized in Western modernity, it is inherently both modern Authoritarian and archaically [[numinous]] (i. e. a form of ''irrational'' related to [[magical thinking]]), in such that the following characteristics apply to prejudice:

*'''''"Das Vorurteil sucht seine eigene Bestätigung"''''' ("Prejudice seeks to self-corroborate"): The slightest imaginary or factual hint towards any individual out-group member conforming to prejudice is taken as undeniable corroborating evidence for the prejudice being justified (also see ''self-maintenance of prejudice'' below),
*'''Moral absolutism''': Particular prejudices are often presented in public and private discourse as an absolute, unquestionable social consensus, as the bare minimum standards of any civilized society, with a wide number of irrational ethnocentric derivations provided as rationalizations, and
*'''Guilt-by-association''': Any critic of prejudice is quickly suspected a sympathizer, even closeted member of the particular out-group.

=== Self-maintenance of prejudice: Prejudice, cognition, and social identity ===

As the human mind's cognitive structures are naturally disposed to both consciously and unconsciously gather and process information constantly in order to relate to the outside world, to oneself, and to one's own relations to the world (in other words, man constantly seeks and constructs sense, meaning, association, and belonging in order to understand and cope) also and most foremost in a social sense ("Who am I, and how do I relate to the social continuum around me?"), and because individual cognitive capabilities are as limited as that the individual is required to widely rely on social conventions in everyday life (which in combination with decreased instinctual drives is the origin of cognitive disposition towards ''social learning'' in primates), Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg posits that if no more positive social identity relating to one's traits is available, then even the most negative social identity, no matter with what aggressive and harmful behavior it is associated, is preferred to total loss of identity.

As also individual social identity, i. e. what social group(s) an individual identifies with due to their traits, is socially learned, it is that the more Authoritarian and hostile the prejudiced discourse on a particular out-group, the fewer positive social identities are available to be acquired by individual out-group members. Therefore, the behavior-guiding individual social identity of out-group members is strongly influenced by the stigmatizing labels applied by the majority in-group, and prejudice may yield the very pathological traits, the very aggressive, harmful, even criminal behavior in individual out-group members that out-groups are said to indulge in. In short, the majority in-group's dominant prejudices can thereby result in a self-fulfilling prophecy, a process which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg dubs "self-maintenance of prejudice" (''Selbststabilisierung des Vorurteils''). For this reason, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg dedicated ''Angst und Vorurteil'' to the prefaced motto ''Minderheitenschutz ist Mehrheitenschutz'' ("Protecting minorities (from prejudice) helps protect the majority.")

Furthermore, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg expressly incorporates structural violence of the state, including involuntary medico-therapeutical intervention, as a form of discrimination, considering it a regulating, standardizing ''[[dispositif]]'' motivating further discrimination by "vigilant" individuals. Due to laws born out of ethnocentric prejudice, their potential to motivate "vigilant" hate crimes, and the tendency of dominant severe prejudice to self-fulfill, another prominent adage of the book is ''Falsche Gesetze zeitigen echte Verbrechen'' ("False laws ripen into true crimes.") which is also included in Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's 1972 fiction novel ''Deutschlands Hoffnung'', and her 1985/88 work ''Der pädophile Impuls''.

=== Sexual deviance and prejudice ===

Throughout Western history, particularly factual or putative sexual deviance could only be seen as pathologically and thus counter-naturally motivated, harmful and corrupting in its consequences, criminal according to the laws, heinous and despicable to any decent person's sentience and morals, basically just plain ''evil''. Most social out-groups in history were constructed by associating them with lewdness and sexual deviance, or, due to taboo making sexual deviance unmentionable directly, by means of cultural codifications for such that Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg related in detail after chronicling their cultural origins in ''Tabu Homosexualität''.

Such cultural codes for lewdness and sexual deviance particularly included sadism, insidiousness, madness, weakness, cowardice, untrustworthiness, obsessive lying, betrayal, treason, evil sorcery, satanism, witchcraft, intoxicating drugs and poisoning potions, laziness, stubbornness, waywardness, incorrigibility, physical diseases and ailments (especially limping). These cultural codifications always have been, until the present day, largely identical with the imaginary, or constructed, attributes that sexual minorities were, and are, tagged with.

Additional such codifying associations were patterned according to particular sexual deviances, in such that these particular sexual minorities were perceived as either biologically or mentally faulted in a way that associated them with those social groups or social categories that their particular sexuality was regarded as naturally belonging to; for instance, gay males were regarded as effeminate, i. e. womanish, as women were regarded as the only category of people that could legitimately feel sexual desire towards men.

=== Countering strategies ===

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg criticizes as ineffective the traditional approach to prejudice of assuming that personal contact with out-group members might decrease prejudice towards their group, by pointing out, for instance, the societal situation of Jewish people in [[Austria-Hungary]] prior to [[World War I]]. Even though the percentage of Jews in population was much lower in the [[German Empire]] and thus Germans had much fewer personal contacts with Jews, [[anti-Semitism]] was much more common and radical in Austria-Hungary than it was in Germany at the time. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg explains this pattern as due to above-mentioned ''self-maintenance of prejudice'', the fact that ''prejudice seeks to self-corroborate'', and prejudice's tendency to self-fulfill.

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg lists three assumptively more effective countering strategies:
*Authorities, institutions, and the mass media must provide the general public with less biased, less emotional, and less scandalizing information regarding discriminated out-groups.
*More positive social identities relating to the particular factual traits of out-groups must be constructed and brought to attention both of the general public and individual out-group members.
*Collaborative goals must be provided in order to unite the majority in-group and minority out-groups for the same causes.

'''''The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation''''', a [[style guide]], prescribes the most widely used [[legal citation]] system in the United States. ''The Bluebook'' is compiled by the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' Association, the ''[[Columbia Law Review]]'', the ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]'', and the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''. Currently, it is in its 20th edition. It is so named because its cover is blue.

''The Bluebook'' is taught and used at a majority of [[Law school in the United States|U.S. law schools]], and is also used in a majority of [[United States federal courts|U.S. federal courts]]. Alternative legal citation style guides exist, including the ''[[Maroonbook]]'' and the ''[[ALWD Citation Manual]]''. There are also several "house" citation styles used by legal publishers in their works.

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] uses its own unique citation style in its opinions, even though most of the justices and their [[law clerk]]s obtained their [[Legal education in the United States|legal education]] at law schools that use ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref name="Salmon1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salmon|first1=Susie|title=Shedding the Uniform: Beyond 'A Uniform System of Citation' to a More Efficient Fit|journal=Marquette Law Review|date=2016|volume=99|page=792|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5289&amp;context=mulr|accessdate=28 April 2017|publisher=Marquette University|location=Milwaukee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many [[state court (United States)|state courts]] have their own citation rules that take precedence over ''The Bluebook'' for documents filed with those courts. Some of the local rules are simple modifications to ''The Bluebook'' system, such as [[Maryland]]'s requirement that citations to Maryland cases include a reference to the official Maryland reporter. [[Delaware]]'s [[Supreme Court of Delaware|Supreme Court]] has promulgated rules of citation for unreported cases markedly different from ''The Bluebook'' standards, and custom in that state as to the citation format of the [[Delaware Code]] also differs from ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courts.delaware.gov/forms/download.aspx?id=39368 Rule 14(g)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190900/http://courts.delaware.gov/forms/download.aspx?id=39368 |date=2016-03-03 }}, Rules of the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware.&lt;/ref&gt; In other states, notably [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Texas]], and [[Michigan]], the local rules are different from ''The Bluebook'' in that they use their own style guides. Attorneys in those states who practice both in federal court and state court must be able to switch seamlessly between citation styles depending upon whether their work product is intended for a federal or state court. Since 2008, [[California]] rules of court have allowed citations in Bluebook form as well as the state's own style manual,&lt;ref&gt;Cal. Rule of Court 1.200&lt;/ref&gt; but many practitioners and courts continue to recommend following the ''California Style Manual'' in California courts.&lt;ref name="Salmon2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salmon|first1=Susie|title=Shedding the Uniform: Beyond 'A Uniform System of Citation' to a More Efficient Fit|journal=Marquette Law Review|date=2016|volume=99|page=791|url=http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5289&amp;context=mulr|accessdate=28 April 2017|publisher=Marquette University|location=Milwaukee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online subscription version of ''The Bluebook'' was launched in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20131009085954/http://www.law.yale.edu/news/6288.htm The Bluebook Legal Citation Guide Now Available Online]'', {{smallcaps|Yale Law School}}, (Feb. 22, 2008) (archived from [http://www.law.yale.edu/news/6288.htm original] Oct. 9, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; A mobile version was launched in 2012 within the rulebook app, an app that allows lawyers, scholars, judges, law students, paralegals, and others involved in the legal profession to reference federal and state court rules, codes, and style manuals on iPad and other mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Law Librarianship in the Digital Age}} 142 (Ellyssa Kroski ed. 2013); Gabriella Khorasanee, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20131206163441/https://blogs.findlaw.com/technologist/2013/08/theres-an-app-for-that-top-10-apps-for-law-students.html?DCMP=NWL-pro_top There's An App For That: Top 10 Apps for Law Students]'', {{smallcaps|Findlaw.com}}, (Aug. 23, 2013) (archived from [https://blogs.findlaw.com/technologist/2013/08/theres-an-app-for-that-top-10-apps-for-law-students.html?DCMP=NWL-pro_top original] Dec. 6, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

According to Harvard, the origin of ''The Bluebook'' was a pamphlet for proper citation forms for articles in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' written by its editor, [[Erwin Griswold]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hurt, ''The Bluebook at Eighteen: Reflecting and Ratifying Current Trends in Legal Scholarship'', 82 {{smallcaps|Ind. L.J.}} 49, 51-52 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to a recent study by two [[Yale]] librarians,&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Shapiro &amp; Julie Graves Krishnaswami, ''The Secret History of the Bluebook'', [http://www.minnesotalawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ShapiroKrishnaswami_ONLINEPDF.pdf 100 {{smallcaps|Minn. L. Rev.}} 1563] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard's claim is incorrect. They trace the origin of ''The Bluebook'' to a 1920 publication by [[Karl N. Llewellyn]] at Yale on how to write law journal materials for the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Karl N. Llewellyn, The Writing of a Case Note}} (1920). This booklet had a blue cover, which Shapiro and Krishnaswami point out is "appropriate for its University," whose official color is blue.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors point out that some of the material in the 1926 first edition of ''The Bluebook'' (as well as that in a 1922 Harvard precursor to it published as ''Instructions for Editorial Work'') duplicate material in the 1920 Llewellen booklet and its 1921 successor, a blue pamphlet that the ''Yale Law Journal'' published as ''Abbreviations and Form of Citation''.&lt;ref&gt;According to Shapiro and Krishnaswami:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Bluebook'' 1 (1926) has approximately 30 sentences in common with ''Yale Law Journal'' ’s ''Abbreviations and Form of Citation'' (1921), as well as many of the sample citations, all of the proofreading signs, and virtually all of the items in the long list of abbreviations. They both begin with the same sentence: “This pamphlet does not pretend to include a complete list of abbreviations or all the necessary data as to form.” The subtitle of the ''Bluebook'' is “Abbreviations and Form of Citation.” The ''Jones v. Smith'' Connecticut citation that is the basic case citation example used by the Yale precursors back to Llewellyn-Field is the basic case example used in Bluebook 1. The Haines ''Yale Law Journal'' citation that is the basic periodical citation example used by the Yale precursors back to Llewellyn-Field is the basic periodical example used in ''Bluebook'' 1. Most of the section on treatises is identical between 1921 and 1926.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years before the first edition of ''The Bluebook'' appeared, Yale, Columbia, and several other law journals "worked out a tentative citation plan," but Harvard initially opposed it "because of skepticism as to the results to be attained and in part because of a desire not to deviate from our forms especially at the solicitation of other Reviews." Eventually, Harvard "reversed course" and joined the coalition by 1926. According to Judge [[Henry J. Friendly]], "Attorney General [Herbert] Brownell, whom I had known ever since law school—he was Editor-in-Chief of the ''Yale Law Journal'' the year I was at the ''Harvard Law Review'' and he and I and two others [from Columbia and Pennsylvania] were the authors of the first edition of the ''Bluebook''."&lt;ref&gt;David M. Dorsen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z9ctStY3580C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false {{smallcaps|Henry Friendly, Greatest Judge of His Era}}] 71 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover of the 1926 ''A Uniform System of Citation'' was green. The color was "brown from the second (1928) edition through the fifth (1936) edition. It was only with the sixth (1939) edition that it became blue."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Shapiro and Krishnaswami.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, the cover of the book was changed from brown to a "more patriotic blue" allegedly to avoid comparison with a color associated with [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Darby Dickerson, ''An Un-Uniform System of Citation: Surviving with the New Bluebook'', 26 {{smallcaps|Stetson L. Rev.}} 53, 58-60 (1996). According to Shapiro and Krishnaswami, however, "The abandonment of brown is often attributed to the association of that color with Nazi Germany in the 1930s, but that idea appears to trace to a joke by Alan Strasser," in [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/hcrcl12&amp;id=515&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;terms=Alan%20Strasser&amp;termtype=phrase&amp;set_as_cursor=10 ''Technical Due Process: ?''], 12 {{smallcaps|Harv. C.R.-C.L. Rev.}} 507, 508 (1977). Strasser states, referring to the eleventh edition's change of cover color to white with a blue border promising a "new life," that "the 1939 ''Blue Book'' had electrified the nation by parading patriotic blue covers instead of the Germanic brown ones that had disgraced the 1936 edition." ''Id''. (footnote omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; The eleventh edition, published in 1967, was actually white with a blue border.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160302144344/http://blawg.law.sc.edu/2015/07/13/all-the-fun-facts-about-the-bluebook/ ''All the Fun Facts about the Bluebook''].&lt;/ref&gt; The cover color returned to blue in the twelfth edition of 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Strasser, at 508. Strasser states that the first printing was a "timid" blue-gray but later printings were a "more self-assured" navy blue. ''Id''. n.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The full text of the first (1926) through the fifteenth (1991) editions are available on the official website.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20120716192512/https://www.legalbluebook.com/public/introduction.aspx Introduction]'', {{smallcaps|Bluebook.com}}, (2010), (archived from the [https://www.legalbluebook.com/public/introduction.aspx original] June 24, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Bluebook'' uses two different styles.  The first is used by practitioners in preparing court documents and memoranda, while the second is used primarily in academic settings, such as [[law reviews]] and journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Deborah E. Bouchoux}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RJ4vlBrWu0MC&amp;pg=PR4&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=cite+checker+bouchoux&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Yd6_SArt3B&amp;sig=uWjCbuvyeYJSxn0kLnnTwy7kz-g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9ppr1vPDKAhVKOSYKHdmVC4cQ6AEIQDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=cite%20checker%20bouchoux&amp;f=false {{smallcaps|Cite-Checker: A Hands-on Guide to Learning Citation Form}}] 9 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter uses specific formatting to identify types of references, such as the use of [[small caps]] for books, newspapers, and law reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; A rule of thumb used by many is to see if the formatting can be reproduced on a [[typewriter]]—if so, it is used by practitioners, if it requires typesetting, it is used for academic articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, ''The Bluebook'' was "the main guide and source of authority" on legal references for the past 90 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|William H. Putman}}, {{smallcaps|Legal Research, Analysis, and Writing}} 468 (4th ed. 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is recognized as the "gold standard" for legal references in the United States, even though it originally was designed only to help teach law students how to cite cases and other legal material.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although other citation systems exist, they have limited acceptance, and in general, ''The Bluebook'' is followed in legal citation as the most widely accepted citation style.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Putman}}, at 468; {{smallcaps|Bouchoux}}, at 2; Kroski, at 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some states have adopted ''The Bluebook'' in full, while others have partially adopted ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Putman}}, at 468-69.&lt;/ref&gt;  States such as Texas have supplements, such as the "Greenbook", that merely address citation issues unique to Texas and otherwise follow ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Brandon D. Quarles &amp; Matthew C. Cordon}}, {{smallcaps|Legal Research for the Texas Practitioner}} 16 (2003); {{smallcaps|The Greenbook: Texas Rules of Form}} iv (12th ed. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==

=== Federal ===
The [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] issues a style guide that is designed to supplement ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Solicitor General's Style Guide}} 1 (Jack Metzler ed. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  This guide focuses on citation for practitioners, so as an example, only two type faces are used for law reviews, normal and italics.&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, at 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other changes are also minor, such as moving ''supra'' from before the page referenced to after the page number.&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, at 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The guide does state that unless explicitly specified otherwise, ''The Bluebook'' rule takes precedence in the event of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Metzler, at 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State ===
California used to require use of the ''California Style Manual''.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Edward W. Jessen}}, {{smallcaps|California Style Manual}} 1 (4th ed. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the [[California Supreme Court]] issued a rule giving an option of using either the ''California Style Manual'' or ''The Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;2013 Calif. R. of Ct. 1.200; {{smallcaps|The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation}} 30 (Mary Miles Prince ed., 19th ed. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  The two styles are significantly different in citing cases, in use of ''Ibid'' or ''Id.'' (for ''{{lang|la|Idem}}''), and in citing books and journals.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://libguides.law.ucla.edu/loader.php?type=d&amp;id=92912 Legal Research and Writing Manual]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'', {{smallcaps|UCLA School of Law}} (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  Michigan uses a separate official citation system, issued as an administrative order of the Michigan Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;Elan S. Nichols, ''Checklists for Drafting, Formatting, and Submitting Litigation and Other Documents: Instructive Material for Law Students Practicing in Law School Clinics, and Reminders for the Practicing Attorney and Her Staff'', 15 {{smallcaps|T.M. Cooley J. Prac. &amp; Clinical L.}} 57, 58 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary difference is that the Michigan system "omits all periods in citations, uses italics somewhat differently, and does not use 'small caps.'"&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, at 58 n.3.&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted, Texas merely supplements ''The Bluebook'' with items that are unique to Texas courts, such as citing to cases when Texas was an independent republic,&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Greenbook}}, at 101.&lt;/ref&gt; petition and writ history,&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Greenbook}}, at 20-26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Texas Attorney General|Attorney General]] Opinions,&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|The Greenbook}}, at 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt; and similar issues.

== Reception ==

=== Criticism of ''Bluebook''{{'}}s prolixity ===

At over 500 pages for the 19th edition, ''The Bluebook'' is significantly more complicated than the citation systems used by most other fields. Legal scholars have called for its replacement with a simpler system.&lt;ref name=yale&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''[http://www.yalelawjournal.org/review/the-bluebook-blues The Bluebook Blues]'', 120 {{smallcaps|Yale L.J.}} 850-861 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Chicago]] uses the simplified "[[Maroonbook]]",&lt;ref&gt;80 {{smallcaps|[http://lawreview.uchicago.edu/page/maroonbook The University of Chicago Manual of Legal Citation]}} 1 (Bradley G. Hubbard, Taylor A.R. Meehan, &amp; Kenneth A. Young eds. 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; and even simpler systems are in use by other parties.

Judge [[Richard Posner]] is "one of the founding fathers of ''Bluebook'' abolitionism, having advocated it for almost twenty-five years, ever since his 1986 ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]'' article&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''[http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2797&amp;context=journal_articles Goodbye to the Bluebook]'', 53 {{smallcaps|Chi. L. Rev.}} 1343 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject." In a 2011 ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' article, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation'' exemplifies hypertrophy in the anthropological sense. It is a monstrous growth, remote from the functional need for legal citation forms, that serves obscure needs of the legal culture and its student subculture.&lt;ref name=yale /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He wrote that a cursory look at the Nineteenth Edition "put [him] in mind of Mr. [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Kurtz]]’s dying words in ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''—'The horror! The horror!' "&lt;ref name=yale /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Post called it "the most boring piece of intellectual property imaginable." Adam Liptak described it as "a comically elaborate thicket of random and counterintuitive rules about how to cite judicial decisions, law review articles and the like [that] is both grotesque and indispensable." [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/09/the-new-and-much-improved-bluebook-caught-in-the-copyright-cross-hairs/ ''The new (and much improved) ‘Bluebook’ caught in the copyright cross-hairs''], {{smallcaps|Washington Post}}, ''The Volokh Conspiracy'' (Feb. 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Posner personally uses a far simpler citation system based largely on the First Edition of the ''Bluebook''. This system, which he includes in a manual he provides for his law clerks, was reprinted in the aforementioned ''Yale Law Journal'' article. At the time of the article, his citation system was 885 ''words'' long, or about two printed pages—far shorter than the 511 pages of the Nineteenth Edition, the 640 pages of the then-current ''ALWD Citation Manual'', or the over 1,000 pages of the ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Manual of Style]]''.&lt;ref name=yale /&gt;

=== ''BabyBlue'' copyright controversy ===

Another dispute is over the copyright status of ''The Bluebook''.  Open-source advocates claim that ''The Bluebook'' is not protected under copyright because it is a critical piece of legal infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;In addition, according to NYU Professor Christopher Sprigman, "the copyright for the 10th edition of the tome, published in 1958, was never renewed, and .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. that means it is in the public domain." See [http://abovethelaw.com/2016/02/yale-law-students-support-the-end-of-the-bluebook/?rf=1 ''Yale Law Students Support The End Of The Bluebook''], {{smallcaps|Above the Law}} (Feb. 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers who represent the Bluebook publishing consortium claim that the "carefully curated examples, explanations and other textual materials" are protected by copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[American Bar Association]] | title=Legal minds differ on whether The Bluebook is subject to copyright protection | date=February 1, 2015 | author=Leslie A. Gordon | url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/legal_minds_differ_on_whether_the_bluebook_is_subject_to_copyright_protecti | access-date=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group led by Professor Christopher J. Sprigman at NYU Law School has been preparing a "public-domain implementation of the ''Bluebook''{{’}}s Uniform System of Citation." which his group calls ''BabyBlue''. However, a law firm (Ropes &amp; Gray) representing the Harvard Law Review Association (HLRA) sent him a letter stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e believe that ''[[BabyBlue]]'' may include content identical or substantially similar to content or other aspects of ''The Bluebook'' that constitute original works of authorship protected by copyright, and which are covered by various United States copyright registrations.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

[M]y client has been and remains concerned that the publication and promotion of such a work may infringe the Reviews’ copyright rights in ''The Bluebook'' and ''The Bluebook'' Online, and may cause substantial, irreparable harm to the Reviews and their rights and interests in those works.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

[I]t is our client’s position that the title ''BabyBlue'', or any title consisting of or comprising the word “Blue,” when used on or in connection with your work, would so resemble the ''BLUEBOOK'' Marks as to be likely, to cause confusion, mistake, and/or deception…Accordingly, and to avoid any risk of consumer confusion, my client respectfully demands that you agree (i) not to use the title or name ''BabyBlue'', or any other title or name including the word “blue,” for your work.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;Letter quoted in Jacob Gershman, [https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/12/28/bluebook-critics-incite-copyright-clash/?mod=WSJBlog ''Bluebook Critics Incite Copyright Clash''], {{smallcaps|Wall Street Journal Law Blog}} (Dec. 28, 2015), and in Mike Masnick, ''Harvard Law Review Freaks Out, Sends Christmas Eve Threat Over Public Domain Citation Guide''], in {{smallcaps|Techdirt}} (Dec. 28, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to the HLRA letter to Sprigman, over 150 students, faculty, staff and alumni of Harvard Law School signed a petition in support of ''BabyBlue''. Yale and NYU students added their separate petitions supporting ''BabyBlue''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hlrecord.org/2016/02/harvard-law-review-should-welcome-free-citation-manual-not-threaten-lawsuits/ ''Harvard Law Review Should Welcome Free Citation Manual, Not Threaten Lawsuits''], {{smallcaps|Harvard Law Record}} (Feb. 16, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; A posting in the ''Harvard Law Record'' commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The intellectual property claims that the HLR Association made may or may not be spurious. But independent of that, the tactics employed by the HLR Association’s counsel in dealing with Mr. Malamud and Prof. Sprigman are deplorable. The Harvard Law Review claims to be an organization that promotes knowledge and access to legal scholarship. It is a venerated part of the traditions of Harvard Law School. But these actions by the Harvard Law Review speak of competition and not of justice.&lt;ref name="''id''."&gt;''Id''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The posting also suggested that HLRA should "redirect the money it spends on legal fees ($185,664 in 2013)" to a more worthy purpose.&lt;ref name="''id''."/&gt;

David Post commented: "It’s copyright nonsense, and Harvard should be ashamed of itself for loosing its legal hounds to dispense it in order to protect its (apparently fairly lucrative) publication monopoly."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/02/09/the-new-and-much-improved-bluebook-caught-in-the-copyright-cross-hairs/ ''The new (and much improved) ‘Bluebook’ caught in the copyright cross-hairs''], {{smallcaps|Washington Post}}, ''The Volokh Conspiracy'' (Feb. 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2016, it was announced that the project had changed its name to the ''[[Indigo Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Michael|title=Response|url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2806393/Harvard-Response-20160331.pdf|publisher=public.resource.org|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial controversy ==

Revenues from the sale of the ''Bluebook'' are estimated "in the millions of dollars."&lt;ref&gt;Fred R. Shapiro and Julie Graves Krishnaswami, [http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=308111088105096097087001004108109007054027040080070045096086028073001068126123008002126026116029049096000076016091095116108107016036036048035081098124089024081068068022023075002115125103105125088011113029091090012067007071118120093113072117092124096115&amp;EXT=pdf ''The Secret History of the Bluebook''].&lt;/ref&gt; For the first 50 years, the Harvard Law Review kept 100 percent of the revenues.&lt;ref name="''id''."/&gt; In 1974, the editors of the ''[[Columbia Law Review|Columbia]]'' and ''[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]]s'' and the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' apparently discovered this, due to an indiscretion.&lt;ref&gt;According to Joan G. Wexler, Dean and then President of [[Brooklyn Law School]], some members of the ''Harvard Law Review'' disclosed to her at a lunch one day in [[San Francisco]] where they were all summer associates "[w]hat a cash cow" the ''Bluebook'' was for their review. She consulted Professor [[Ralph S. Brown]] at Yale Law School, who taught copyright, and he said "sue them!" See Shapiro and Krishnaswami.&lt;/ref&gt; They complained that Harvard was illegally keeping all profits from the first eleven editions, estimated to total $20,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;W. Duane Benton, ''Developments in the Law – Legal Citation'', 86 {{smallcaps|Yale}} L.J. 197, 202 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; After they threatened to sue, and considerable wrangling, Harvard agreed with them to split the revenue: 40 percent for Harvard, 20 percent each for Columbia, Pennsylvania, and Yale; Harvard would continue to provide the production and distribution services.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Legal technology and future ==

The ''Bluebook'' has also been affected by the disruptions to the legal industry due to [[legal technology]].&lt;ref name="LawTechToday"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goodman|first1=Bob|title=Four Areas of Legal Ripe for Disruption by Smart Startups|url=http://www.lawtechnologytoday.org/2014/12/smart-startups/|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Law Technology Today|date=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the [[startup company]] LegalEase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LegalEase official website|url=https://www.legaleasecite.com/bluebook-citation-generator}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched a [[legal citation]] generator that enables its users to create citations in the ''Bluebook'' format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyberg|first1=Cheryl|title=Bluebook 101 Online Citation Generators|url=http://guides.lib.uw.edu/c.php?g=375743&amp;p=2550183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Butts Up''' (A.K.A. "Spread Eagle", "A-Ball", "Asses Up", "Assies' Rehab &amp; Tea", "Suey", "Balliver Shagnasty's Revenge", "Balls Deep", "Ballsies", "Beartrap"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7WVaMZAu2PEC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22Butt+ball%22+game+ball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UUIkUYjGK6TI0AHKwoGACg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Butt%20ball%22%20game%20ball&amp;f=false Children's Folklore: A Handbook], p.75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A2xc-rivz5oC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=%22Butt+ball%22+game+ball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UUIkUYjGK6TI0AHKwoGACg&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Butt%20ball%22%20game%20ball&amp;f=false When Play Was Play: Why Pick-Up Games Matter], p 76&lt;/ref&gt; , "Blackjack" (along with many other colloquial names)) is a North American [[elementary school]] children's [[playground]] game originating in the 1950s or earlier. It is slightly similar to the game Screen Ball. Butts Up or Booties Up began in the 1940s or 1950s as a penalty phase of various city street games. Butts Up is played with a ball (such as a [[tennis ball]], [[handball]], or [[racquetball]]) on a paved surface against a wall, with a variable number of participants—usually more than three and often likely to exceed ten. Butts Up tends to be played during [[Recess (break)|recess]], before or after school. {{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}. Popular in New England is another frequent variation of [[wallball]] that usually differs a lot from the more widely known 'Butts Up'.

Players determine the variations of the game prior to start of play. Some of the rules of the game very loosely resemble the rules of [[baseball]] and [[racquetball]].

==Object of the game==
The object of the game is to be the last player remaining in the game after all other players are out.

In some variations of the game, there is no specific object of the game. Play continues until time runs out. In this variation, when players are "out" three times, they must lean against the wall and wait to be hit by the ball ("Butts Up"). See below for more on this.

==Rules of the game==
The first player, usually the tennis ball owner, starts the game or "breaks the ice" (see terminology below) by throwing the ball against the wall with the objective of having the ball hit the wall without hitting the ground first.

After the ball makes contact with the wall and bounces off the ground at least once, any of the players, including the thrower, may then try to catch the ball. If catcher mishandles the ball and the ball touches the ground, the catcher must try to touch the wall before another player fields and throws the ball against the wall. If the ball touches the wall before the catcher, the catcher is out and must face various consequences. In some places, instead of hitting the wall you have to throw it '''at''' the catcher.

If the ball is caught before hitting the [[Road surface|pavement]], the thrower is penalized with one "out", much like baseball. Some refer to this as a "cobra", or "ace". After three outs a player leaves the game. Sometimes alternate words, such as "wall," are used instead. In some cases, such as in [[New York City]], the catcher has to "peg" the thrower, while the thrower trys to touch the wall, if the thrower misses, the throwers doesn't get an out.

If the thrower's ball bounces before hitting the wall, the thrower must run to the wall and touch the wall before an opponent can pick up the ball and throw it to the wall. If the original thrower doesn't make contact with the wall before the ball reaches the wall, the original thrower is out. If the thrower reaches for the ball, but has it bounce off his fingers and onto the pavement, this counts as missing the throw, and he must run to the wall.

In one variation of the game, a runner who does not reach the wall before the thrown ball hits must, in addition to receiving an out, stand facing the wall and allow the thrower to "peg" him or her with the ball (usually with all possible force).
[[File:Buttsup.jpg|thumbnail|In the "Blue Gooch" variation of the game, the player who is "out" must keep their legs apart, so the thrower has a chance at shooting them in the perineum.]]
In another variation, when a player is "out" three times, he or she must lean against the wall, bent over with his butt in the air—hence the name of the game—and wait for the ball to be thrown at him. Other players take turns throwing the ball until he is hit. If he doesn't look back, the thrower must lob the ball in the air, but if he does, the thrower may peg him with as hard a throw as he likes. Also, in this version, the thrower must hit the player as he is running to the wall, rather than hitting the wall, to get the runner out.

The game continues until all but one player have received three outs and left the game. This form of the game is referred to as "three–out elimination".

In [[New York City]], the game is usually called "Asses Up", and the game is played exactly the same, the only major difference is that when ever a kid is "out", or doesn't touch the wall before the ball or is hit with the ball by another player, instead of eliminated after three "outs", they get eliminated when they complete the word "Asses Up" with each "out" is a letter in the game (I.e. A-S-S-E-S-U-P). This is similar with spelling out "Horse" in [[Basketball]]. Also, the term "Reach" is used when a catcher is far away, and the ball is usually thrown at the thrower as an alternative to "pegging" (usually when smaller kids are playing).

In a variation practiced widely in [[Santa Clara County, California]] elementary schools as late as the mid-1980s, each time a player earned an out, his "butt was up," and he would stand with hands against the wall, waiting to be pegged by the player who threw him out.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} If the player is hit in the "target area," he is convicted of the out, and gets a letter (B-U-T-T, for example), and leaves the game. In this variation, at the ice breaker's discretion, play may pass by number, i.e., Player 1 breaks the ice, then Player 2 must retrieve and throw the ball, followed by Player 3, etc. In more physical games, the ball is not required to bounce after touching the wall, and aggressive players will stand near the wall, within arms' reach, pegging other players and quickly touching the wall, then retrieving the ball and throwing the other player out. Other rules included "handsies", which prohibits players from touching the ball with both hands at once (the ball could be tossed in the air and caught with the other hand, but typically a great show was made of this feat in order to avoid even the appearance of a foul). Also, a player with ball in hand must keep one foot planted at all times, or, in the interest of justice, if a player was stranded well beyond throwing or relay distance (see "Savies"), he could take one large step toward the wall. If a player realizes he has mishandled the ball and thus must "hit the wall," and deliberately "spikes" the ball to frustrate others' attempts to throw him out, his butt is automatically up; at the other players' discretion, they may each take a turn at throwing that player out. The attack does not cease simply because a pegger has successfully scored in the target area; each player throws nonetheless, usually with intent to cause injury or disfigurement.

In more recent variations of the game, a player only receives an out if he or she is actually hit by the peg, rather than receiving it for having to be on the wall. Also, if a player wins without having gotten an out, the win is called a 'lockdown'.

In New England, specifically the Tri-State Area, another version of Wall Ball was invented. In this variation two or more people line up to take turns hitting the ball. The ball must bounce first, then hit the wall, then bounce; the next person in line must hit the ball before its second bounce on the ground, then the ball must hit the wall, then bounce. This repeats for however many people there are. It is usually played with three outs, but the number could vary depending on the amount of people. There are also many variations in each school, but the overall premise is usually the same. Wall Ball in New England is usually considered a separate game from Butts Up. In some areas in Westchester county, this variant is called "Watermelon", which is named for the legal action of going completely under the ball as a hit.

In a Maryland version of wallball, the icebreaker starts the game, with all other players nearby. Players are allowed to catch the ball if it has not bounced, as well as catching other players' throws. Failing to catch the ball, taking too long to get a handle on the ball or any other type of "bobbling" is the "bobblers" cue to touch the wall. If a player is relatively far from the wall while holding the ball, other players may call "wallball" (hence the name), meaning the player with the ball has ten seconds to hit the wall, without moving or bouncing the ball off the ground. If a player is out, he must stand on the wall and get pegged by the player who got him out. If the peg is successful (player hit), play continues with the icebreaker throwing the ball first. If the peg is unsuccessful (player not hit), other players have the opportunity to get the thrower out. No penalty besides pegging occurs from an out. Fouls include kicking the ball, preventing a player from getting you out (kicking or throwing the ball after bobbling as opposed to dropping it), tampering with a throw or interfering with a peg (interference can also occur if a player running to touch the wall is obstructed by another player.) Interference is determined by the other players in the game.

Yet another playground version of the game (popular in southern Arizona) simply had all the participants apart from the first player line up against the wall, with the immediate goal of the first player to hit a participant with the ball (typically as hard as possible) and thus make that participant "it".  This version resembles dodge ball but with the wall limiting the possible dodging moves to two dimensions rather than three.  Any participant who strayed too far away from the wall during play was "punished" by a penalty shot, where the thrower would aim solely at him or her and throw the ball as hard as possible, although a hit in this case did not make the person "it".  When a player became "it" by legal means, he or she assumed the role of "thrower".  The object of this game—like many other playground games—was simply to inflict pain on classmates, and was thus often played in relatively obscure or off-limits areas of the playground.

Another version of wallball is that the ball is catchable off the wall and the catching player can move about freely as long as they throw the ball within the next few seconds. If the ball bounces very far away from the wall the other players may call "challenge" to the player with the ball. A call of challenge means the player may not move and must throw the ball and try to hit the wall. If the player chooses to drop the ball at his/her feet then the player is automatically out. The thrower, however, may choose to simply throw it at an object that would cause the ball to be hard to get before the thrower can be thrown out, possibly causing a successive number of challenges until a suitable throw has been made. If a player catches the ball they may run to the wall and place both their off hand and foot on the wall and call "bulldog." If the player does this they can freely throw the ball at whomever they wish. If they hit another player then the hit player must touch the wall before they are thrown out. "Bulldogs" are usually frowned upon by other players and considered a cheap way of getting other players out. If a player has committed a double touch another player may call the foul and is allowed a throw at the person. The offending player must be "spread eagle" as it is called, against the wall and may not move. The thrower is not allow a full force throw unless the person moves or flinches as it is usually taken from a short distance. This can either result in a peg or a double throw depending on the rules. If the thrower makes a full force throw without the offender moving then the thrower must be pegged by the original offender. In some games the thrower on "spread eagle" must touch the wall or they too will be out, unless they missed and hit the wall.

==Terminology==
*'''Black Mail or Reach''': Once the ball is caught (usually from a long distance) any player may yell "Black Mail!" The player with the ball must now throw the ball to the wall without moving feet.
*'''Break the Ice''': To start the game by making the first throw regardless of ball ownership.
* '''Savies''' or '''Taxis''': If a player feels he is too far from the wall to throw the ball and make wall contact, the thrower can throw the ball to another player and hope the receiver will wait until the thrower has run to the wall and touched it. However, savies can backfire if the catcher betrays the thrower by throwing the ball to the wall before the thrower has run and touched the wall. In some places, there is no betrayal as, if you save them they don't have to run.
*'''Chicken Drops''': An alternative to Savies. If a player is too far from the wall to make a complete pass to hit the wall, he can drop the ball at his feet and head to the wall as quickly as he can to make contact. If another player picks up the ball that player can throw the runner out by getting the ball to the wall before the runner. This technique is frowned upon by Butts Up enthusiasts.
*'''Double Touch''': The act of a player touching the ball twice, resulting in an automatic out. Typically this occurs when the ball is bobbled or tripped over.
*'''Handsies''': (Some variations) The act of a player touching the ball with both hands at once, resulting in an obligation to "hit the wall".
*'''Hit the Wall''': Alternative terminology for a player's obligation, upon committing "handsies," "chicken drops," "traveling," or other offense, failure to accomplish which before any other player has thrown the player out by causing it to hit the wall results in an out or the runner's butt being "up".
*'''Peg''': A player throws the ball at another player, usually resulting in an out for both players.
*'''Self-Out''': A player throws the ball to the wall and then catches it before the ball hits the pavement. This rule is optional and can be determined by the players prior to the start of the game.
*'''Self-Peg''': A thrower's ball bounces off the wall and hits the thrower. In this case the thrower must run to the wall and touch the wall before an opponent picks up the ball and throws it to the wall.
*'''Stripping''': In more physical iterations of the game, a player may attempt to strip the ball from the hand of another player. If successful, both players must run to the wall to avoid earning an out.
*'''Tie Goes to the Runner''': If there is a dispute among the players about whether a runner is safe or out, and the decision for and against is a 50/50 tie among players, the runner stays in the game.
*'''Traveling''': The act of a player moving both feet with ball in hand.
*'''Lockdown''': Occurs when a player wins the game without having gotten out.
*'''Poison''': When someone catches the ball without the ball hitting the ground. If they say "poison" the "poisoned" person must run to the wall before the person who caught the ball throws it to the wall.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form is also used in music, in which it falls in the general category of [[Antiphon|antiphony]].

==African cultures==
In [[Africa]]n cultures, call-and-response is a widespread pattern of democratic participation—in public gatherings, in the discussion of civic affairs, in religious rituals, as well as in vocal and instrumental [[music]]al expression (see [[call and response (music)|call and response in music]]). African bondsmen and bondswomen in the Americas continued this practice over the centuries in various forms of expression—in religious observance; public gatherings; even in children's rhymes; and, most notably, in music in its multiple forms: [[blues]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[jazz]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] and [[go-go]].{{citation needed|date=May 2008}} Many work songs sung on plantations by enslaved men and women also incorporate the call and response format. [[African-American Women Work Songs]] incorporate the call and response format, a format that fosters dialogue. In contemporary African-American worship services, where call and response is pervasive, a pastor will call out to his congregants to engage an enthusiastic response.  For example "Can I get an Amen?" or "Raise your hands and give Him praise!"

Call and response is derived from the historical African roots that served as the foundation for African American cultural traditions. The call and response format became a diasporic tradition, and it was part of Africans and African Americans creating a new, unique tradition in the United States. &lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Dena J., ''Sinful Tunes and Spirituals: Black Folk Music to the Civil War.'' Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1977. &lt;/ref&gt; 

While slave masters encouraged conversion of slaves to Christianity, African slaves still practiced their own form of religious celebration, which was called [[Christian views on slavery|Slave Christianity]]. But [[antiphony]], a kind of call and response in Anglican worship, was also part of formal services in the South for centuries. African Americans put that tradition to their own use, as well as picking themes from Christianity that meant the most to them. 

Several analysts{{who|date=May 2011}} have assessed the ecstatic spirituality expressed in worship of African-American slaves. They noted two major elements: call and response, and the [[ring shout]]. The latter is considered a metamorphosis of exuberant song and dance at the height of tribal or religious celebration. Participants move in a counterclockwise circle (the direction the sun moves south of the equator, from where the majority of sub-Saharan slaves had been taken).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2858">The '''Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI)''' carries out research and development for agriculture in the Caribbean region. Its headquarters are on the campus of the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI), at [[Saint Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago|St. Augustine]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and it also has national offices throughout the region.

==History==
CARDI’s roots are to be found in the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture (ICTA), run by the British in Trinidad. In 1955 a Regional Research Centre (RRC) was established as part of ICTA. With withdrawal of British funding foreseen in the late-1960s, RRC’s staff was transferred to the Faculty of Agriculture of UWI. The RRC had become particularly known for carrying out soil surveys and for the production of soil maps of Caribbean countries, as well as for research on traditional food crops and on pests, diseases and weed management.
Within the context of the [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]], which promoted regional cooperation, the region’s Heads of Government appointed a team to examine both RRC and regional agricultural research in general. This concluded that RRC should be replaced by a new regional organization that would be independent of UWI and be responsible to the [[CARICOM]] Standing Committee of Ministers of Agriculture. Following acceptance of these recommendations CARDI was established in 1975. &lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.cardi.org/welcome-to-cardi/history/|website=CARDI|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;At its inception, 12 CARICOM member countries signed the agreement to establish CARDI: Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St Kitts–Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago. These provide funds for the Institute’s core budget, while funding for projects comes from donor agencies.  &lt;ref name="History" /&gt;
==Activities==
CARDI is charged with a wide range of development activities, in addition to the strengthening of regional collaboration for agricultural research. These include the upgrading of facilities for intra-regional agricultural trade and transport and the evaluation of investment opportunities, as well as the provision of market intelligence.  Emphasis is placed on [[Root vegetables|roots]] and [[tubers]], cereals and pulses, hot peppers, fruits and vegetables and small [[ruminants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commodities &amp; Themes|url=http://www.cardi.org/commodities-themes/|website=CARDI|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Command and control''' or '''C2''' is a "set of organizational and technical attributes and processes ... [that] employs human, physical, and information resources to solve problems and accomplish missions" to achieve the goals of an organization or enterprise, according to  a 2015 definition by [[military science|military scientists]] [[Marius Vassiliou]], [[David S. Alberts]] and [[Jonathan R. Agre]],&lt;ref&gt;Vassiliou, Marius, David S. Alberts, and Jonathan R. Agre (2015). "C2 Re-Envisioned: the Future of the Enterprise."

Versions of the [[United States Army]] [[List of United States Army Field Manuals|''Field Manual 3-0'']] circulated circa 1999, define C2 in a [[military]] organization as the exercise of [[authority]] and direction by a properly designated [[commanding officer]] over assigned and attached [[Armed forces|forces]] in the accomplishment of a [[Military operation|mission]].&lt;ref&gt;''para''&amp;nbsp;5-2, [[List of United States Army Field Manuals#FM 3-0|United States Army Field Manual: FM&amp;nbsp;3–0]]&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book |author=Headquarters, Department of the Army |authorlink=United States Department of the Army#Headquarters, Department of the Army |title=FM&amp;nbsp;3–0, Operations |date=14 June 2001 |place=Washington, DC |publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office|GPO]] |oclc=50597897 |url=http://155.217.58.58/cgi–bin/atdl.dll/fm/3-0/fm3-0.exe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020219134603/http://155.217.58.58/cgi-bin/atdl.dll/fm/3-0/fm3-0.exe | archivedate=19 February 2002 |deadurl=yes |format=PDF inside [[Zip (file format)|ZIP]]–[[Self-extracting archive|SFX]] |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;br/&gt;[https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-0.pdf Newer versions of FM 3-0] do not define ''Command and control'', even though they use the term extensively.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Builder, Carl H., Bankes, Steven C., Nordin, Richard, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/2006/MR775.pdf "Command Concepts – A Theory Derived from the Practice of Command and Control"], MR775, [[RAND]], {{ISBN|0-8330-2450-7}}, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1988 [[NATO]] definition, command and control is the exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated individual over assigned resources in the accomplishment of a common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modelling Command and Control: Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork |author1=Neville Stanton |author2=Christopher Baber |author3=Don Harris |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |date=1 January 2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Modelling_Command_and_Control.html?id=chqJM48ZBBkC&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Australian Defence Force]] definition, similar to that of NATO, emphasises that C2 is the system empowering designated personnel to exercise lawful authority and direction over assigned forces for the accomplishment of missions and tasks.&lt;ref name=ADDP001&gt;{{cite web |title=ADDP 00.1 Command and Control |date=27 May 2009 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |pages=1–2 |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/adfwc/Documents/DoctrineLibrary/ADDP/ADDP_00_1_Command_and_Control.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Australian doctrine goes on to state: The use of agreed terminology and definitions is fundamental to any C2 system and the development of joint doctrine and procedures. The definitions in the following paragraphs have some agreement internationally, although not every potential ally will use the terms with exactly the same meaning.&lt;ref name=ADDP001/&gt;)

==Overview==

===US perspective===
The US ''[[Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/ DoD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms], www.dtic.mil&lt;/ref&gt; defines command and control as: "The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Also called C2. Source: JP 1".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/data/c/3226.html Command and control] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629002310/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/data/c/3226.html |date=29 June 2011 }}, Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, www.dtic.mil&lt;/ref&gt;

The edition of the ''Dictionary'' "As Amended Through April 2010" elaborates, "Command and control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications, facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and [[Military operation|operations]] in the accomplishment of the mission."&lt;ref name=JP12010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joint Chiefs of Staff (U.S.)|title=Joint Publication 1-02. Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms (As Amended Through 31 January 2011)|date=8 November 2010|entry=Command and Control|page=65|url=http://ra.defense.gov/Portals/56/Documents/rtm/jp1_02.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this sentence is missing from the "command and control" entry for the edition "As Amended Through 15 August 2014."&lt;ref name=JP12014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Joint Chiefs of Staff (U.S.)|title=Joint Publication 1-02. Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms (As Amended Through 15 August 2014)|date=8 November 2010|entry=Command and Control|page=44|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commanding officers are assisted in executing these tasks by specialized [[Staff (military)|staff officers]] and enlisted personnel. These ''military staff'' are a group of officers and enlisted personnel that provides a bi-directional [[information flow|flow of information]] between a [[Officer (armed forces)|commanding officer]] and subordinate [[military units]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The purpose of a military staff is mainly that of providing accurate, timely information which by category represents information on which command decisions are based. The key application is that of decisions that effectively manage unit resources. While information flow toward the commander is a priority, information that is useful or contingent in nature is communicated to lower staffs and units.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Computer security industry===
{{main article|Command and control (malware)}}
This term is also in common use within the [[computer security]] industry and in the context of [[cyberwarfare]]. Here the term refers to the influence an attacker has over a compromised computer system that they control. For example, a valid usage of the term is to say that attackers use "command and control infrastructure" to issue "command and control instructions" to their victims. Advanced analysis of command and control methodologies can be used to identify attackers, associate attacks, and disrupt ongoing malicious activity.&lt;ref&gt;Command Five Pty Ltd, [http://www.commandfive.com/papers/C5_APT_C2InTheFifthDomain.pdf "Command and Control in the Fifth Domain"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227035957/http://www.commandfive.com/papers/C5_APT_C2InTheFifthDomain.pdf |date=27 February 2012 }}, February 2012, www.commandfive.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivative terms==
There are a plethora of derivative terms which emphasise different aspects, uses and sub-domains of C2. These terms come with a plethora of associated abbreviations – for example, in addition to C2, command and control is also often abbreviated as C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and sometimes as C&amp;C.

==Command and control centers==
[[File:Soviet command ship SSV-33.jpg|thumb|The Soviet nuclear-powered command and control naval ship ''SSV-33 Ural''.]]
A '''command and control center''' is typically a secure room or building in a government, military or [[prison]] facility that operates as the agency's dispatch center, surveillance monitoring center, coordination office and alarm monitoring center all in one. Command and control centers are operated by a government or municipal agency.

Various branches of the [[US military]] such as the [[US Coast Guard]] and [[US Navy|Navy]] have command and control centers. They are also common in many large correctional facilities.

A command and control center that is used by a military unit in a deployed location is usually called a "command post".&lt;ref&gt;[http://peoc3t.monmouth.army.mil/cp/cpsi_cpp.html US Army PEO C3T – Project Manager, Command Posts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511155756/http://peoc3t.monmouth.army.mil/cp/cpsi_cpp.html |date=11 May 2010 }}, peoc3t.monmouth.army.mil&lt;/ref&gt; A warship has a [[Combat Information Center]] for tactical control of the ship's resources, but commanding a fleet or joint operation requires additional space for commanders and staff plus [[C4I]] facilities provided on a [[Flagship]] (e.g., aircraft carriers), sometimes a [[Command ship]] or upgraded logistics ship such as [[USS Coronado (AGF-11)|USS ''Coronado'']].

==Command and control warfare==
Command and control warfare encompasses all the military tactics that use communications technology. It can be abbreviated as C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;W. An older name for these tactics is "signals warfare", derived from the name given to communications by the military. Newer names include [[information operations]] and [[information warfare]].

The following techniques are combined:
* [[Operations security]] (OPSEC)
* [[Military deception]]
* [[Psychological operations]] (PSYOP)
* [[Electronic warfare]] (EW)
* [[Psychological warfare]]
* Cyber Operations
with the physical destruction of enemy communications facilities. The objective is to deny [[information]] to the enemy and so disrupt its [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] capabilities. At the same time precautions are taken to protect friendly command and control capabilities against retaliation.

In addition to targeting the enemy's [[Command and control (military)|command and control]], [[information warfare]] can be directed to the enemy's [[politics|politicians]] and other civilian communications.

==Early life==
Epstein was born in [[Milwaukee]] to William Polacheck &lt;ref&gt;I came a Stranger, by Hilda Polacheck&lt;/ref&gt; and Hilda Satt. She studied music at the [[University of Chicago]] and library science at the [[University of Illinois]], graduating in 1943. She worked as a cataloguer at the latter institution while completing her degree, and upon graduation was appointed the Senior Music Librarian at [[Newark Public Library]]. In 1946 she began working as a cataloguer and reviser for the [[Library of Congress]] music section.&lt;ref name=uc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bmrcsurvey.uchicago.edu/collections/2549|accessdate=15 November 2013|publisher=University of Chicago|title=Dena J. Epstein Papers}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending a period as a homemaker, she returned to the University of Chicago in 1964 as the Assistant Music Librarian, in which position she served for 22 years.&lt;ref name=mla/&gt;&lt;ref name=ban/&gt;

==Scholarship==
Beginning in 1955, Epstein began researching the historical origins of [[Slavery in the United States|American slave]] music.&lt;ref name=uc/&gt; Her 1977 book on the topic, ''Sinful Tunes and Spirituals: black folk music to the Civil War'', was awarded the Chicago Folklore Prize and the Simkins Prize of the Southern Historical Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sinful-Tunes-Spirituals-BLACK-American/dp/0252071506|accessdate=15 November 2013|publisher=Amazon|title=''Sinful Tunes and Spirituals''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other findings, Epstein demonstrated that the [[banjo]] emerged from the African slave tradition rather than rural white culture, a revelation that "shattered myths and sparked a remarkable revival of black string band music".&lt;ref name=ban&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utk.edu/news/2013/11/the-librarian-and-the-banjo/|accessdate=15 November 2013|publisher=University of Tennessee Knoxville|title=''The Librarian and the Banjo''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein received two [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] grants for her research, which was included in several musicology journals. She also published ''Music Publishing in Chicago Before 1871'' (1969) and ''I Came a Stranger: The Story of a Hull-House Girl'' (1989), an edited autobiography of her mother.&lt;ref name=mla&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/?EpsteinAward|accessdate=15 November 2013|publisher=Music Library Association|title=Dena Epstein Award for Archival and Library Research in American Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Epstein served as president of the [[Music Library Association]] (MLA) from 1977 to 1979, and was awarded the association's highest citation in 1986. MLA adjudicates a research award named after Epstein.&lt;ref name=mla/&gt;

Filmmaker Jim Carrier created ''The Librarian and the Banjo'' to document Epstein's contribution to American ethnomusicology. He noted that she "revolutionized our understanding of American music... we take for granted that African-American music is the tap root of popular American music. We owe much of that knowledge to this music librarian who set out to correct history".&lt;ref name=ban/&gt;

Epstein's papers and correspondence are held by [[Columbia College Chicago]]'s Center for Black Music Research.&lt;ref name=uc/&gt;

Epstein also appeared in the PBS documentary program American Experience "[http://www.shoppbs.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/filmmore/index.html Chicago, City of the Century]".  Her interview regarding her mother and conditions in the Near West Side Neighborhood at the turn of the 19th century appears on Disc 3: Battle for Chicago.

[[File:Endosymbiosis.PNG|thumb|200px|A representation of the [[endosymbiotic theory]]]]

An '''endosymbiont''' or '''endobiont'''&lt;ref name="KingDom"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Margulis |first1=Lynn |author1link=Lynn Margulis |last2=Chapman |first2=Michael J. |title=Kingdoms &amp; domains an illustrated guide to the phyla of life on Earth |date=2009 |publisher=Academic Press/Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-08-092014-6 |page=493 |edition=4th |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=9IWaqAOGyt4C&amp;pg=PA493 |accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is any [[organism]] that lives within the body or cells of another organism in a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] (formerly called symbiotic) relationship with the host body or cell, often but not always [[mutualism (biology)|to mutual benefit]].
The term '''endosymbiosis''' is from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: ἔνδον ''endon'' "within", σύν ''syn'' "together" and βίωσις ''biosis'' "living"). Examples are [[nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacteria]] (called [[rhizobia]]), which live in [[root nodule]]s on [[legume]] roots, single-cell [[algae]] inside reef-building [[coral]]s, and bacterial endosymbionts that provide essential nutrients to about 10–15% of insects.

Many instances of endosymbiosis are obligate; that is, either the endosymbiont or the host cannot survive without the other, such as the [[Siboglinidae|gutless marine worms]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Riftia]]'', which get nutrition from their endosymbiotic bacteria. The most common examples of obligate endosymbioses are [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. Some human parasites, e.g. ''[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]'' and ''[[Mansonella perstans]]'', thrive in their intermediate insect hosts because of an obligate endosymbiosis with ''[[Wolbachia]] spp.'' They can both be eliminated from said hosts by treatments that target this bacterium. However, not all endosymbioses are obligate and some endosymbioses can be [[symbiosis|harmful]] to either of the organisms involved.

Two major types of [[organelle]] in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic cells]], [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[plastid]]s such as [[chloroplast]]s, originated by [[symbiogenesis]] as bacterial endosymbionts.

===In marine invertebrates===

Extracellular endosymbionts are also represented in all four extant classes of [[Echinodermata]] ([[Crinoidea]], [[Ophiuroidea]], [[Echinoidea]], and [[Holothuroidea]]). Little is known of the nature of the association (mode of infection, transmission, metabolic requirements, etc.) but [[phylogenetic]] analysis indicates that these symbionts belong to the alpha group of the class [[Proteobacteria]], relating them to ''Rhizobium'' and ''Thiobacillus''. Other studies indicate that these [[subcuticular bacteria]] may be both abundant within their hosts and widely distributed among the Echinoderms in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burnett WJ, McKenzie JD |title=Subcuticular bacteria from the brittle star ''Ophiactis balli'' (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea) represent a new lineage of extracellular marine symbionts in the alpha subdivision of the class Proteobacteria |journal=Appl.

Some marine [[oligochaeta]] (e.g., ''[[Olavius]]'' and ''[[Inanidrillus]]'') have obligate extracellular endosymbionts that fill the entire body of their host. These marine worms are nutritionally dependent on their symbiotic [[chemoautotroph]]ic bacteria lacking any digestive or excretory system (no gut, mouth, or [[nephridia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dubilier, N.; Mülders, C.; Ferdelman, T. |title=Endosymbiotic sulphate-reducing and sulphide-oxidizing bacteria in an oligochaete worm |journal=Nature |volume=411 |issue=6835 |pages=298–302 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11357130 |doi=10.1038/35077067 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In protists===

''[[Mixotricha paradoxa]]'' is a protozoan that lacks mitochondria. However, spherical bacteria live inside the cell and serve the function of the mitochondria. ''Mixotricha'' also has three other species of symbionts that live on the surface of the cell.

''[[Paramecium bursaria]]'', a species of [[ciliate]], has a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with green alga called Zoochlorella. The algae live inside the cell, in the cytoplasm.

''[[Paulinella|Paulinella chromatophora]]'' is a freshwater [[amoeboid]] which has recently (evolutionarily speaking) taken on a [[cyanobacterium]] as an endosymbiont.

=== In insects ===

Scientists classify insect endosymbionts in two broad categories, 'Primary' and 'Secondary'. Primary endosymbionts (sometimes referred to as P-endosymbionts) have been associated with their [[insect]] hosts for many millions of years (from 10 to several hundred million years in some cases). They form obligate associations (see below), and display cospeciation with their insect hosts. Secondary endosymbionts exhibit a more recently developed association, are sometimes horizontally transferred between hosts, live in the [[hemolymph]] of the insects (not specialized bacteriocytes, see below), and are not obligate.&lt;ref&gt;P. Baumann, N. A. Moran and L. Baumann, Bacteriocyte-associated endosymbionts of insects in M. Dworkin, ed., ''The prokaryotes'', Springer, New York, 2000. http://link.springer.de/link/service/books/10125/&lt;/ref&gt;

Among primary endosymbionts of insects, the best-studied are the pea [[aphid]] (''[[Acyrthosiphon pisum]]'') and its endosymbiont ''[[Buchnera (proteobacteria)|Buchnera]] sp.'' APS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Douglas |first=A E |title=Nutritional interactions in insect-microbial symbioses: Aphids and their symbiotic bacteria Buchnera |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=43 |pages=17–38 |year=1998 |issn=0066-4170 |pmid=15012383 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.43.1.17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Douglas AE |title=Nutritional interactions in insect-microbial symbioses: Aphids and Their Symbiotic Bacteria ''Buchnera'' |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=43 |pages=17–37 |date=January 1998 |pmid=15012383 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.43.1.17 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.ento.43.1.17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shigenobu S, Watanabe H, Hattori M, Sakaki Y, Ishikawa H |title=Genome sequence of the endocellular bacterial symbiont of aphids Buchnera sp. APS |journal=Nature |volume=407 |issue=6800 |pages=81–6 |date=September 2000 |pmid=10993077 |doi=10.1038/35024074 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[tsetse fly]] ''Glossina morsitans morsitans'' and its endosymbiont ''[[Wigglesworthia glossinidia brevipalpis]]'' and the endosymbiotic [[protists]] in lower [[termite]]s. As with endosymbiosis in other insects, the symbiosis is obligate in that neither the bacteria nor the insect is viable without the other. Scientists have been unable to cultivate the bacteria in lab conditions outside of the insect. With special nutritionally-enhanced diets, the insects can survive, but are unhealthy, and at best survive only a few generations.

In some insect groups, these endosymbionts live in specialized insect cells called [[bacteriocyte]]s (also called ''mycetocytes''), and are maternally-transmitted, i.e. the mother transmits her endosymbionts to her offspring. In some cases, the bacteria are transmitted in the [[Egg (biology)|egg]], as in ''Buchnera''; in others like ''Wigglesworthia'', they are transmitted via milk to the developing insect embryo. In termites, the endosymbionts reside within the hindguts and are transmitted through [[trophallaxis]] among colony members.

The primary endosymbionts are thought to help the host either by providing nutrients that the host cannot obtain itself or by metabolizing insect waste products into safer forms. For example, the putative primary role of ''Buchnera'' is to synthesize [[essential amino acid]]s that the aphid cannot acquire from its natural diet of plant sap. Likewise, the primary role of ''Wigglesworthia'', it is presumed, is to synthesize [[vitamin]]s that the tsetse fly does not get from the [[blood]] that it eats. In lower termites, the endosymbiotic protists play a major role in the digestion of lignocellulosic materials that constitute a bulk of the termites' diet.

Bacteria benefit from the reduced exposure to [[predator]]s and competition from other bacterial species, the ample supply of nutrients and relative environmental stability inside the host.

Genome sequencing reveals that obligate bacterial endosymbionts of insects have among the smallest of known bacterial genomes and have [[genome reduction|lost many genes]] that are commonly found in closely related bacteria. Several theories have been put forth to explain the loss of genes. It is presumed that some of these genes are not needed in the environment of the host insect cell. A complementary theory suggests that the relatively small numbers of bacteria inside each insect decrease the efficiency of natural selection in 'purging' deleterious mutations and small mutations from the population, resulting in a loss of genes over many millions of years. Research in which a parallel [[phylogeny]] of bacteria and insects was inferred supports the belief that the primary endosymbionts are transferred only vertically (i.e., from the mother), and not horizontally (i.e., by escaping the host and entering a new host).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wernegreen JJ |title=Primer – Endosymbiosis: Lessons in Conflict Resolution |journal=PLoS Biol |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=e68 |year=2004 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020068 |url=http://www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020068 |pmid=15024418 |pmc=368163 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040414043954/http://www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0020068 |archivedate=14 April 2004 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wernegreen JJ |title=Genome evolution in bacterial endosymbionts of insects |journal=Nat.

Attacking obligate bacterial endosymbionts may present a way to control their insect hosts, many of which pests or carriers of human disease. For example, aphids are crop pests and the tsetse fly carries the organism ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]'' that causes African [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aksoy S, Maudlin I, Dale C, Robinson AS, O'Neill SL |title=Prospects for control of African trypanosomiasis by tsetse vector manipulation |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=29–35 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11137738 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1471-4922(00)01850-X |doi=10.1016/S1471-4922(00)01850-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other motivations for their study is to understand symbiosis, and to understand how bacteria with severely depleted genomes are able to survive, thus improving our knowledge of [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]].

Less is known about secondary endosymbionts. The pea aphid (''[[Acyrthosiphon pisum]]'') is known to contain at least three secondary endosymbionts, ''[[Hamiltonella defensa]]'', ''[[Regiella insecticola]]'', and ''[[Serratia symbiotica]]''. ''H. defensa'' aids in defending the insect from parasitoids. ''[[Sodalis glossinidius]]'' is a secondary endosymbiont of tsetse flies that lives inter- and intracellularly in various host tissues, including the midgut and hemolymph. Phylogenetic studies have not indicated a correlation between evolution of ''[[Sodalis]]'' and tsetse.&lt;ref&gt;Aksoy, S., Pourhosseini, A. &amp; Chow, A. 1995. Mycetome endosymbionts of tsetse flies constitute a distinct lineage related to Enterobacteriaceae. Insect Mol Biol. '''4''', 15-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike tsetse's P-symbiont ''Wigglesworthia'', though, ''Sodalis'' has been cultured ''in vitro''.&lt;ref&gt;Welburn, S.C., Maudlin, I. &amp; Ellis, D.S. 1987. In vitro cultivation of rickettsia-like-organisms from Glossina spp. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. '''81''', 331-335.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dinoflagellate endosymbionts ==

[[Dinoflagellate]] endosymbionts of the genus ''Symbiodinium'', commonly known as [[zooxanthella]]e, are found in [[corals]], [[mollusk]]s (esp. [[giant clam]]s, the ''Tridacna''), [[sea sponge|sponges]], and [[foraminifera]]. These endosymbionts drive the formation of [[coral reefs]] by capturing sunlight and providing their hosts with energy for [[carbonate]] deposition.&lt;ref name=Baker2003&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baker AC |title=FLEXIBILITY AND SPECIFICITY IN CORAL-ALGAL SYMBIOSIS: Diversity, Ecology, and Biogeography of Symbiodinium |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=34 |pages=661–89 |date=November 2003 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132417 |url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146%2Fannurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously thought to be a single species, molecular [[phylogenetic]] evidence over the past couple decades has shown there to be great diversity in ''Symbiodinium''. In some cases, there is specificity between host and ''Symbiodinium'' [[clade]]. More often, however, there is an ecological distribution of ''Symbiodinium'', the symbionts switching between hosts with apparent ease. When reefs become environmentally stressed, this distribution of symbionts is related to the observed pattern of [[coral bleaching]] and recovery. Thus, the distribution of ''Symbiodinium'' on coral reefs and its role in coral bleaching presents one of the most complex and interesting current problems in reef [[ecology]].&lt;ref name=Baker2003/&gt;

==Viral endosymbionts==
{{main|Endogenous retrovirus}}

The human genome project found several thousand [[endogenous retrovirus]]es, [[endogenous viral element]]s in the [[genome]] that closely resemble and can be derived from [[retrovirus]]es, organized into 24 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Villarreal LP |title=Persisting Viruses Could Play Role in Driving Host Evolution |journal=ASM News |date=October 2001 |publisher=American Society for Microbiology |url=http://newsarchive.asm.org/oct01/feature1.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508113235/http://newsarchive.asm.org/oct01/feature1.asp |archivedate=8 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbiogenesis and organelles ==
{{Main|Symbiogenesis}}

Symbiogenesis explains the origins of [[eukaryote]]s, whose cells contain two major kinds of [[organelle]], [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. The theory proposes that these organelles evolved from certain types of bacteria that eukaryotic cells engulfed through [[cytosis|endophagocytosis]]. These cells and the bacteria trapped inside them entered an endosymbiotic relationship, meaning that the bacteria lived within the eukaryotic cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sagan, Lynn |authorlink=Lynn Margulis |year=1967 |title=On the origin of mitosing cells |journal=[[J Theor Biol]] |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=255–274 |pmid=11541392 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(67)90079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Faith &amp; Politics Institute''' is a [[Washington, D.C.]] non-profit organization that serves members of Congress and congressional staff by offering experiential pilgrimages, reflection groups, retreats and public forums."  Through its bipartisan programs, the group "works to bridge racial, religious, and political divisions among elected officials, while promoting reflective and ethical leadership.&lt;ref name="mott"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613234556/http://www.mott.org/sitecore/content/Globals/Grants/2010/201000065_General+Purposes.aspx|title=Grants 2010|author=|date=13 June 2010|website=mott.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mott.org/grants/faith-and-politics-institute-congressional-conversations-on-race-program-development-200100932-01/&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1991, hundreds of members of Congress, Congressional staff, and their constituents have taken part in efforts "that encourage collaborative and visionary leadership practices and foster healing, civility, and respect."&lt;ref name="mott"/&gt;

The organization was headed by the Rev. Doug Tanner for the first 15 years of its existence, with Fr. Cletus Kiley taking over as president in 2006,&lt;ref name="kiley"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408161719/http://www.usccb.org/comm/archives/2006/06-071.shtml|title=Father Kiley to Head The Faith &amp; Politics Institute|author=|date=8 April 2006|website=USCCB - (Office of Media Relations)|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; succeeded in 2011 by the Rev.

While many Democratic and Republican Congressional Representatives work with the organization, including those on its Congressional Advisory Board, Representative [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], a former leader of the [[Civil rights movement]] in America, has played a special role in its programs, including its annual Civil Rights Pilgrimage to Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810103707/http://thecommongroundblog.com/2011/02/16/congressman-john-lewis-recieves-medal-of-freedom|title=Congressman John Lewis Recieves(sic) Medal of Freedom|author=|date=10 August 2011|website=The Common Ground Blog|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1991 to "provide bipartisan, bridge-building opportunities for political leaders to experience the spiritual power of conscience, courage, and compassion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114202005/http://www.nndb.com/org/014/000120651|title=Faith and Politics Institute|author=|date=14 November 2017|website=[[NNDB]]|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for the group resulted from an early "reflection group" that included Rep. [[Glenn Poshard]], Ms. Anne Bartley, Rev. Joe Eldridge, and Rev. Doug Tanner. Convinced of the importance of such opportunities for reflection, Tanner founded the Institute in 1991 "with the hope of providing opportunities for meaningful interactions and experiences among those who lead and serve our nation",
Some of the Institute's earliest efforts were linked to the "Common Ground" program, providing opportunities for staffers and members to help rebuild churches burned by arsonists in the mid-1990s.

In 1997, the organization expanded its programs when then-President Rev. Doug Tanner persuaded Representative [[Amo Houghton]] and Representative John Lewis (D-GA) to serve as the co-chairmen of the group's Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104040605/http://www.faithandpolitics.org/staff_and_board|title=Staff and Board|author=|date=4 January 2012|website=The Faith &amp; Politics Institute|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their involvement brought in many additional members and leaders of Congress interested in dialogue across party, religious, racial, and ideological lines, creating a "spiritual community of men and women who seek a better way to do the people's business."&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Board and Advisors==
The Board consists primarily of lobbyists, Government Relations professionals, and lawyers specializing in Government Regulation practices, representing such companies as [[Akin Gump, LLC]], [[Alston &amp; Bird LLP]], [[American Airlines]], [[American Bridge Company|American Bridge]], [[American Values Network]], [[Arent Fox]], [[Aspen Institute]], [[Association of American Publishers]], [[A Capitol Fourth|Capital Concerts Inc.]], [[Coca-Cola Company]], [[Covidien]], [[Eleison LLC]], [[Escambia Enterprises]], [[Federal City Council]], [[Fluor Corporation]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[General Motors]], [[Goldman Sachs Group]], [[Jewish Funds for Justice]], [[Alvin Radkowsky|Lightbridge Corporation]], [[Microsoft Corporation]], [[Moore Consulting]], [[National Association of Broadcasters]], [[National Democratic Institute]], [[Regions Financial]], [[The First Group]], [[The Memorial Foundation]], [[TwinLogic Strategies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Christina Wilkie | title=Lyft Prepares To Fight Ride Share Regulation By Hiring GOP-Linked Lobbyists | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/16/lyft-lobbying_n_5161322.html | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Health Group]], and [[Williams &amp; Jensen]], and others.&lt;ref name="leadership" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024103500/http://faithandpolitics.org:80/leadership/|title=Leadership|author=|date=24 October 2016|website=The Faith &amp; Politics Institute|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Board, the Institute includes a “Corporate Advisory Council” composed exclusively of Lobbyists and Government Relations professionals. The members are : Joyce Brayboy ([[The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.]]), Myra Dandridge ([[National Association of Broadcasters]]), Matt Gelman ([[Microsoft Corporation]]), Alison Jones ([[Ford Motor Company]]), Norma Kaehler ([[American Airlines]]), Janine Kellner ([[The Coca-Cola Company]]), David Marventano ([[Fluor Corporation]]), Melinda Maxfield ([[Williams &amp; Jensen PLLC]]), Chris Scribner ([[Regions Financial]]), Kyle Simmons ([[The First Group]]), Dan Turton ([[General Motors]]), Kimberly Woodard ([[The Memorial Foundation]])&lt;ref name="leadership"/&gt;

==Programs and activities==
Activities within these three broad areas include reflection groups, retreats, pilgrimages, and public forums.  The weekly reflection groups and occasional retreats are important opportunities seek to provide opportunities for men and women who work in the "fast-paced and charged atmosphere of Washington, D.C., to "connect their role with their greater calling as human beings." The public forums include lectures by well-known speakers "whose lives reflect moral courage in the political arena." The pilgrimages allow men and women from both houses of congress, along with staff members and special guests, to take part in trips that provide information, inspiration, and opportunities for reflection on the lessons to be learned from past struggles, such as the civil rights movement. The annual pilgrimage to Montgomery and Selma Alabama that includes a walk over the famous Edmund Pettus Bridge is an event led by Representative John Lewis, an early civil rights leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729220650/https://sites.google.com/a/faithandpolitics.org/11th-congressional-civil-rights-pilgrimage/|title=11th Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimage|author=|date=29 July 2016|website=The Faith &amp; Politics Institute|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other special activities include:
*The Lewis-Houghton Leadership Awards: recognizing leaders "who have exhibited qualities of conscience, courage and compassion in their roles as public servants."  
* United States-South Africa Faith and Politics Initiative: In May 2003, The Faith &amp; Politics Institute provided program conceptualization, planning, and coordination for the Congressional visit (CODEL) to South Africa, led by Reps. Houghton and Lewis. This visit provided an opportunity to compare lessons learned from America's civil rights movement and South Africa's fight against [[apartheid]], and established links for future dialogue.
* Saint Joseph's Day Breakfast: an annual breakfast program, including a speaker and awards ceremony, on [[Saint Joseph's Day]]. Because [[Saint Joseph]] is recognized by many as the patron saint of the worker, the Institute's St. Joseph's Day breakfast was founded "to raise awareness of the spiritual and moral issues that affect economic life in America." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208162421/http://events.constantcontact.com/register/event?oeidk=a07e2sl4qal23b8940c|title=St. Joseph's Breakfast|author=|date=8 February 2011|website=[[Constant Contact]]|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Congressional Reception: Every other year, this reception acknowledges both those who have supported the Institute's efforts and those who have been inspired by its programs.&lt;ref name="programs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223212750/http://www.faithandpolitics.org/programs_activities|title=Programs and Activities|author=|date=23 December 2011|website=The Faith &amp; Politics Institute|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faith &amp; Politics Institute just concluded its annual Congressional Pilgrimage to Alabama to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of "Bloody Sunday".  The Institute brought together an unprecedented number of Senators and Members of Congress in a bipartisan fashion to reflect on the Civil Rights struggle of the past.  There were over 100 lawmakers in attendance during the 3 day weekend including addresses and appearances by former President George W. Bush and President Obama in Selma, Alabama.

===Partnerships===
Through partnership efforts with other organizations, the Institute extends its reach by co-sponsoring special events that its basic missions. Some groups, like the [[Fetzer Institute]], partner with the Institute to support a wide variety of its programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927155517/http://www.fetzer.org/resources/resource-detail/?resource_id=2328|title=Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimages|author=|date=27 September 2011|website=Fetzer Institute|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others focus on specific events, including:
*Congressional Conversations on Race: co-sponsored with [[Search for Common Ground]], and founded on a belief in the need for the nation's leaders to recognize the spiritual nature of our nation's historic racial wounds, and work together toward healing.&lt;ref name="cc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326011953/http://congressionalconversations.com/|title=Congressional Conversations|author=|date=26 March 2018|website=congressionalconversations.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20150305013400/http://www.faithandpolitics.org/congressional-conversations-on-race/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Civil Rights Heroes: Buried but not forgotten: in partnership with Sewall-Belmont House, the District of Columbia, GLAAD, and the National Park Service, honored women and men buried in the Congressional Cemetery, who played key roles in advancing justice and equality for all. One of the men honored was Leonard Matlovich a [[Vietnam war]] veteran Tech Sergeant, who had spoken out against discrimination against gay and lesbian service personnel.
*Muslims in America: The Faith &amp; Politics Institute, along with the Newseum's Religious Freedom Education Project and Wesley Theological Seminary, hosted evening of storytelling and honest dialogue what it means to be Muslim-American in our contemporary context.

==Leadership==
The Reverend Doug Tanner was founder and first president of the organization. In 2006, Father Cletus Kiley, a priest of the Archdiocese of Chicago, at that time executive director of the Office of Priestly Life and Ministry of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), took over as president, with Tanner continuing to work as the group's "Senior Advisor."&lt;ref name="kiley"/&gt; The current president is the Rev. Mark J. Farr, previously the Senior Faith Director of the [[Points of Light Institute]].&lt;ref name="staff_and_board" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414035404/http://www.faithandpolitics.org/staff_and_board|title=Staff and Board|author=|date=14 April 2012|website=The Faith &amp; Politics Institute|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farr was selected for the position in January 2011 and officially began work as president on February 28, 2011.&lt;ref name="farr"/&gt;  Rob Liberatore, is the current Interim President and CEO while a national search is conducted for a new President.

Flocs appear as cloudy suspensions of cells floating in water, rather than attached to and growing on a surface like most biofilms.

In general, the mechanisms by which flocculating microbial aggregates hold together are poorly understood.

The '''Friedrich Ebert Foundation''' (''[[German language|German]]: '''Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung'''; Abbreviation: '''FES''''') is a German political [[Foundation (charity)|foundation]] associated with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), yet independent of it. Established in 1925 as the political legacy of [[Friedrich Ebert]], Germany's first democratically elected President, it is the largest and oldest of the German party-associated foundations. It is headquartered in [[Bonn]] and [[Berlin]], and has offices and projects in over 100 countries. It is Germany's oldest organisation to promote democracy, political education, and promote students of outstanding intellectual abilities and personality.
==History==
The FES was named for [[Friedrich Ebert]] (1871–1925), the Social Democratic [[President of Germany]], 1919-1925. In his [[Will (law)|will]], he specified that the proceeds from donations at his funeral should be used to create a foundation.  The SPD chairman at the time, [[Konrad Ludwig]], was given the responsibility of building this foundation, which he did a few days after Ebert's death in 1925.
The main concern of the foundation was to work against discrimination of workers in the area of education:
"The Friedrich Ebert Foundation pursues the goal of giving young, empowered [[proletarians]] government aid to fund an education at state-accredited institutions.  As a basic principle, only those people who have a recommendation from the party organisation will receive funding." (SPD Yearbook 1926)
By the end of 1931, 295 students had been funded with over 52,000 [[Deutsche Mark|marks]].  Unfortunately, at this point the funding of the foundation fell through, as a result of the [[Great Depression]].
The FES was a section of the Social Democratic Education and Culture Organisation, and was banned along with the party itself in 1933 by the [[Nazi]]s.
In 1946, the FES was reinstituted at the founding assembly of the Socialist German Student Federation. In 1954, the FES was restructured into a charitable organisation "for the advancement of democratic education". This established the FES as an independent, self-contained institute.
In addition to education programmes, the FES has also worked in the area of [[development aid]] since the 1960s.  In this effort, it has supported democracy and freedom movements, for instance in the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), and played an important role in overcoming dictatorial regimes in [[Greece]], [[Spain]], and [[Portugal]].  Thus it was not a coincidence that the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party of Portugal]] was formed in an FES school in the German town of [[Bad Münstereifel]].

==Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Academic Foundation==
The '''Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Academic Foundation''' ('''FES''') is one of eleven organizations for the promotion of young talents (Begabtenförderwerke) in Germany. Only 1% of German students achieve a scholarship at one of the eleven organizations (i.e. FES, [[Studienstiftung]], [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stipendiumplus.de/&lt;/ref&gt; It is financially funded and subsidized by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and supports students with outstanding academical and political achievements. Awards are granted after a multi-stage selection process and are based on grades, letters of recommendation, letters of motivation, political and social engagement as well as personality and character. Until today it has sponsored more than 12,000 grantees. Over 90% of those sponsored graduate with honours.  In 2005, there were 1,731 students in the programme, of which 51% were women.  Beyond the financial support, grantees also receive so-called ideational support, which comes from opportunities to attend political seminars, conferences, and other activities, which can be important job qualifications.  The FES kept its own conference center on the Venusberg in [[Bonn]] for these activities until its closure in 2009.  Each year, the grantees vote for a board during the nationwide conference at the Stresemann Institute in Bonn.  This board serves for the next full year as the representation of grantees for dialog with the foundation.  The FES maintains a website ([http://www.fes-stip.de] www.fes-stip.de) for networking among grantees, which includes a wide variety of mailing lists, services, and communications tools.

Students are assigned advisors who work with them for the length of their grants, and also belong to a student organisation.

==Further activities==
[[File:Bonn FES.jpg|thumb|250px|Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Bonn]]
Today, the Friedrich Ebert Foundation's main goals are to promote political and societal education of people from all walks of life in the spirit of democracy and pluralism, to enable young people the opportunity to study and do research through grants, and to work toward international understanding and cooperation.

The foundation employs several hundred employees in their offices in [[Bonn]] and [[Berlin]], as well as in 14 regional offices and an academy within Germany and in over 100 foreign agencies.  It is financed mainly through grants from the federal budget and the budgets of the various [[States of Germany|Bundesländer]].

Since 1971, foreign students have also had the opportunity to receive grants through solidarity funds.  Preference for these grants goes to people who are persecuted on political, racial or religious grounds.  Funding for this program comes exclusively from donations from current and former grantees.  The program have helped over 1,000 students.  Currently there are 31 students who are in the solidarity programme. Two grantees from this programme are chosen every year at the conference in Bonn to work on the steering committee of the fund.

The historical research center of the foundation also contains the Archive of Social Democracy and its libraries in Bonn and at the [[Karl Marx House]] in [[Trier]].  This is one of the largest collections of documents on [[social history]] and the history of the [[Labour movement|workers movement]].

Since 1982, the foundation has awarded a prize of 10,000 euro called "The Political Book" to promote noteworthy political books. The prize serves to remind people of the [[Nazi book burnings]] of May 10, 1933.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2105">'''Fuzzy electronics''' is an [[electronics|electronic]] technology that uses [[fuzzy logic]], instead of the two-state [[Boolean logic]] more commonly used in [[digital electronics]]. Fuzzy electronics is fuzzy logic implemented on dedicated hardware.  This is to be compared with fuzzy logic implemented in software running on a conventional processor. Fuzzy electronics has a wide range of applications, including [[control system]]s and [[artificial intelligence]].

==History==
The first fuzzy electronic circuit was built by Takeshi Yamakawa ''et al.'' in 1980 using discrete bipolar transistors.  The first industrial fuzzy application was in a cement kiln in Denmark in 1982.  The first [[VLSI]] fuzzy electronics was by Masaki Togai and Hiroyuki Watanabe in 1984.  In 1987, Yamakawa built the first analog fuzzy controller.  The first digital fuzzy processors came in 1988 by Togai (Russo, pp. 2-6).

'''Gandhigiri''' is a [[neologism]] in India which is used to express the tenets of [[Gandhism]] (the ideas of [[Mohandas Gandhi]] which include [[Satyagraha]], [[Mahatma Gandhi#Gandhi's principles|non-violence, and truth]]) in contemporary terms. The term became popular due to its usage in the 2006 [[Hindi language|Hindi]] film, ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Arunabha (December 23–29, 2006). "[http://www.epw.org.in/uploads/articles/10078.pdf Lage Raho Munna Bhai: Unravelling Brand Gandhigiri: Gandhi, the man, was once the message.

==Usage==
As a [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] expression in various languages in India including Marathi, Hindi and Tamil, "Gandhigiri" refers to the practice of the ideals of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref name="Ramachandaran"/&gt; It is a [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] form of [[Gandhism]]. ''Gandhism'' (or ''Gandhianism'') is a term which attempts to summarize the philosophies of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Basic tenets of Gandhism include ''[[satya]]'' (truth) and ''[[Satyagraha]]'': "Truth (satya) implies love, and firmness (agraha) engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force...that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or non-violence."&lt;ref name="essenfischer"&gt;{{cite book

{{cquote|Its root meaning is holding on to truth, hence truth-force. I have also called it Love-force or Soul-force. In the application of Satyagraha I discovered in the earliest stages that pursuit of truth did not admit of violence being inflicted on one's opponent but that he must be weaned from error by patience and sympathy. For what appears to be truth to the one may appear to be error to the other. And patience means self-suffering. So the doctrine came to mean vindication of truth not by infliction of suffering on the opponent but on one's self." &lt;ref name="gandhisatya61"&gt;{{cite book

==Popularization of term==
{{main|Lage Raho Munna Bhai}}

===Overview===
''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' is a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[Cinema of India|Indian]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[Comedy film|comedy]] directed by [[Rajkumar Hirani]] and produced by [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]].  [[Sanjay Dutt]] stars in this film as ''[[Munna Bhai]],'' a local don of [[Mumbai]] (Bombay), who begins to see the spirit of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Through his interactions with the image of Gandhi, Munna Bhai begins to practice what he calls ''Gandhigiri'' to help ordinary people solve their problems.

Some have argued that the thematic attention to Gandhi's theories in ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' has both revived an interest in ''[[Gandhism]]'' under the new term, ''Gandhigiri'' in [[India]]&lt;ref name="mridulatoi060929"&gt;{{cite news | first=Mridula| last=Chunduri| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-09-29/hyderabad/27786386_1_gandhigiri-gandhi-jayanti-gandhiji| title= Gandhigiri, a cool way to live| work=timesofindia.com|publisher=Times Internet Limited| date=2006-09-29| accessdate=2006-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and has likewise "made Gandhi suddenly hip. Inspired by the hit movie, Indians are increasingly embracing his philosophy, staging nonviolent protests, starting Web sites, handing out roses to enemies and putting on peaked white caps from the Gandhi era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Kim| last=Barker| url=https://www.bakwashack.ooo/2018/10/review-honor-8x-vs-realme-2-pro-vs-redmi-note-5-pro.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018201506/https://www.bakwashack.ooo/2018/10/review-honor-8x-vs-realme-2-pro-vs-redmi-note-5-pro.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2018-10-18| title=Bollywood film is a hit - and so, again, is Gandhi| work=chicagotribune.com| publisher=Chicago Tribune| date=2006-10-30| accessdate=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, according to reports, Gandhi is now a "new pop icon" in India&lt;ref name="reuters1002"&gt;{{cite news | first=Y.P.| last=Rajesh| url=http://news.scotsman.com/latest_entertainment.cfm?id=1458642006| title= Bollywood gangster comedy makes Gandhi new pop icon|work=Latest News - Entertainment| publisher=scotsman.com| date=2006-10-02| accessdate=2007-04-24}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as Arunabha Ghosh notes, "Gandhi, the man, was once the message. In the India of the post-[[P. V. Narasimha Rao#Economic reforms|liberalisation]] brand, Gandhigiri is the message."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Arunabha |last=Ghosh |url=http://www.epw.org.in/uploads/articles/10078.pdf |title=Lage Raho Munna Bhai: Unravelling Brand Gandhigiri: Gandhi, the man, was once the message.

Theories for this sudden revival vary. Some have suggested that this phenomenon could be attributed to the film simplifying Gandhi's "lofty ideals" and conveying them "in contemporary, colloquial language.&lt;ref name="reuters1002"/&gt; Others, according to ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', have  noted that the appeal of the film lies in the fact that "Gandhi gets his hands dirty. He appears as an apparition only visible to the wayward gangster, counselling him on how to help others deal with everyday problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mark| last=Sappenfield| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1003/p01s04-wosc.html| title=It took a comedy to revive Gandhi's ideals in India| work=csmonitor.com|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor| date=2006-10-03| accessdate=2006-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the reason, a 13 October 2006 article in ''The [[Boston Globe]]'', suggests that the revival has had a positive impact in India and states, "What America needs is a film that encourages people to take up Gandhigiri, [[Martin Luther King|Kinggiri]], or [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedygiri]]. If it worked for [[Bollywood]], it could work for [[Hollywood]]."&lt;ref name="Sharmaboston"&gt;{{cite news | first=Swati Gauri| last=Sharma| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/10/13/how_gandhi_got_his_mojo_back/| title=How Gandhi got his mojo back| work=boston.com|publisher=The New York Times Company |date=2006-10-13|accessdate=2006-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gandhigiri-style protests===
[[File:Marche sel.jpg|thumb|200px|Gandhi leading [[Salt Satyagraha]], a notable example of [[Satyagraha]]]] 
Since the release of the film, there have been instances where peaceful protests were either dubbed 'Gandhigiri' or the protesters have claimed that they have been inspired by the movie.  In the [[United States]] during July 2007, piles of flowers were sent to the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] office by individuals who were legally in the U.S. but caught in a [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]] backlog. This was an act of Gandhigiri (or [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] protest) copied from ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/gandhigiri-works-magic-for-indians-seeking-green-card/45233-2-7.html| title=Gandhigiri works magic for Indians seeking green card| work=[[CNN IBN]]|publisher=[[CNN IBN]] |date=2007-07-19|accessdate=2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been positive reactions to this event.  The USCIS shipped the flowers to the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] and Bethesda Naval hospitals. A 15 July 2007 editorial in ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' argued, "let's hope their protest gets results - because Americans are fortunate to have living among them people who are this ingenious, and this thoughtful of others, and this capable of channeling anger into beauty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=| last=| url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/bal-ed.flowers15jul15,0,5046454.story?coll=bal-opinion-headlines| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130117140605/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/bal-ed.flowers15jul15,0,5046454.story?coll=bal-opinion-headlines| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2013-01-17| title=Flower power| work=Baltimore Sun| publisher=[[Baltimore Sun]]| date=2007-07-15| accessdate=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 17, the USCIS announced that "it will accept applications from foreign professionals seeking permanent residency through an expedited process, reversing its earlier decision." USCIS Director, [[Emilio T. Gonzalez]] noted of the Gandhigiri protest, "The public reaction to the July 2 announcement made it clear that the federal government's management of this process needs further review [...] I am committed to working with Congress and the State Department to implement a more efficient system in line with public expectations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/gandhigiri-works-green-card-seekers-make-us-change-heart/45183-2.html| title='Gandhigiri works!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7623">The '''Gender Studies and Human Rights Documentation Centre''' (Gender Centre) is a non-profit, non-governmental organization that strives to address the issues of gender inequality in [[Ghana]].  Based in [[Accra]], Ghana, the Gender Centre has conducted studies on issues ranging from sexual and psychological violence against school girls to the ways in which social norms lead women to have a higher risk of HIV infection than men. The Centre works with local, national, and international organizations in its work towards addressing the problems facing women in Ghanaian society. The Gender Centre conducts research to provide both quantitative and qualitative data that will lead to new laws, fresh outlooks, and community discussions concerning women in this region of the world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[Dorcas Coker-Appiah]] is the executive director of the Gender Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gendercentreghana.org/?page_id=696|title=Staff|author=|date=|website=gendercentreghana.org|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanfeministforum.com/the-2nd-ghana-feminist-forum-a-personal-perspective/|title=The 2nd Ghana Feminist Forum: A Personal Perspective - African Feminist Forum|author=|date=29 August 2011|website=africanfeministforum.com|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Gender Studies and Human Rights Documentation Centre was founded in 1995. Since that time it has conducted numerous studies and published its findings in two books, ''Violence Against Women &amp; Children In Ghana'' and ''Gender Norms, Violence Against Women, HIV/AIDS, a Case Study In Ghana.''&lt;ref&gt;Both works can be purchased through the Gender Centre by contacting them through their website [http://www.gendercentreghana.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==

The Gender Centre publishes its research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gendercentreghana.org|title=Gender Studies &amp; Human Right Documentation Centre|author=|date=|website=www.gendercentreghana.org|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as manuals, a semiannual newsletter, and an annual report, for other organizations and individuals to use in striving to combat women's inequality.

===Nkyinkyim Anti-Violence Project===
The Gender Centre successfully conducted the Nkyinkyim Anti-Violence Project,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gendercentreghana.org/activitydetail.php?id=1 Retrieved 23 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which began in 1998 and continues today. The project aims to abolish [[violence against women]] through conducting community-based research and pursuing a grassroots approach in which meetings with traditional leaders, religious leaders, and community members lead to local teams responsible for raising awareness, dealing with domestic violence crises, and counseling women who have been victims of violence. The project initially began with 3 communities and expanded in 2005 to include a total of 18 communities around Ghana.

===Safe Schools Project===
The Safe Schools Project,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gendercentreghana.org/activitydetail.php?id=2 Retrieved 23 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) endeavors to address the pressing issue of sexual, physical, and psychological abuse of schoolgirls in Ghana. Over the course of two years the Gender Centre trained 120 counselors from thirty communities in the Central Region of Ghana to provide effective counseling to victimized school girls and to prevent further abuse by teachers and peers.

===Ghanaian Women and HIV/AIDS===
The Gender Centre's most recent work concerns women's susceptibility to contracting [[HIV]] due to certain social norms and gender roles that exist in Ghanaian society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gendercentreghana.org/activitydetail.php?id=6 Retrieved 23 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For this qualitative research project, interviewers were trained to ask probing questions and used tape recorders in order to encourage conversation flow with the anonymous interviewees. The final report, published by the Gender Centre, is meant to complement empirical evidence already existing about the rate of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] in [[West Africa]]. The Ghanaian government has adopted the popular ABCs of HIV prevention ([[abstinence, be faithful, use a condom]]), but the research by the Gender Centre shows that gender norms and domestic violence make this approach to combating the spread of HIV somewhat ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;''Gender Norms, Domestic Violence and Women's Vulnerability to HIV/AIDS.'' Gender Studies and Human Rights Documentation Centre.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in Ghana are traditionally sexually submissive, meaning that they are not always able to deny their male partners sex or insist on condom use. Men, on the other hand, are often free to take multiple sexual partners and even multiple wives. The practice of wife inheritance in which a widow will marry her deceased husband's relative can promote the spread of HIV as well, since the woman may have the virus herself or can contract it from her new husband's other wives or partners. Additionally, the social stigmatization faced by women already infected discourages them from revealing their positive status, putting others at risk for contracting the disease. After this initial research, the Gender Centre has been conducting meetings and workshops to raise awareness about how such social norms are putting women at a higher risk for contracting HIV. The Center endeavors to reverse these detrimental gender norms by holding support meetings in major cities all over the country and by running a series of radio shows about women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS conducted in the local languages of Twi, Ewe, and Wale, as well as English.

==Collaborations==

The Gender Centre has collaborated with other organizations and agencies as it works to promote awareness about the issues facing women in Ghana today.

'''Geometric abstraction''' is a form of [[abstract art]] based on the use of geometric forms sometimes, though not always, placed in [[Perspective (visual)|non-illusionistic]] space and combined into non-objective (non-representational) compositions. Although the genre was popularized by [[avant-garde]] artists in the early twentieth century, similar motifs have been used in art since ancient times.

==History==
Geometric abstraction is present among many cultures throughout history both as decorative motifs and as art pieces themselves. [[Islamic art]], in its prohibition of depicting religious figures, is a prime example of this geometric pattern-based art, which existed centuries before the movement in Europe and in many ways influenced this Western school. Aligned with and often used in the architecture of Islamic civilations spanning the 7th century-20th century, geometric patterns were used to visually connect spirituality with science and art, both of which were key to Islamic thought of the time.

==Scholarly analysis==
[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1939-1942 - Composition 10.jpg|thumb|alt=Piet Mondriaan abstract painting "Composition No. 10" from 1939–42|[[Piet Mondrian]], ''Composition No. 10'', 1939–42, oil on canvas]]
Throughout 20th-century art historical discourse, critics and artists working within the [[reductionism|reductive]] or pure strains of abstraction have often suggested that geometric abstraction represents the height of a non-objective art practice, which necessarily stresses or calls attention to the root plasticity and two-dimensionality of painting as an artistic medium. Thus, it has been suggested that geometric abstraction might function as a solution to problems concerning the need for modernist painting to reject the illusionistic practices of the past while addressing the inherently two dimensional nature of the picture plane as well as the canvas functioning as its support. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], one of the forerunners of pure non-objective painting, was among the first modern artists to explore this geometric approach in his abstract work. Other examples of pioneer abstractionists such as [[Kasimir Malevich]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] have also embraced this approach towards abstract painting. Mondrian's painting "Composition No. 10" (1939–1942) clearly defines his radical but classical approach to the construction of horizontal and vertical lines, as Mondrian wrote, "constructed with awareness, but not with calculation, led by high intuition, and brought to harmony and rhythm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mondrian's Philosophy of Visual Rhythm|last=Tosaki|first=Eiichi|publisher=Springer|year=2017|isbn=9402411984|location=|pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as there are both two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometries, the abstract sculpture of the 20th century was of course no less affected than painting by geometricizing tendencies. [[Georges Vantongerloo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=6091|title=The Collection: Georges Vantongerloo|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Bill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/14/obituaries/max-bill-85-painter-sculptor-and-architect-in-austere-style.html|author=Smith, Roberta|date=December 14, 1994|title=Max Bill, 85, Painter, Sculptor And Architect in Austere Style|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, are perhaps best known for their geometric sculpture, although both of them were also painters; and indeed, the ideals of geometric abstraction find nearly perfect expression in their titling (e.g., Vantongerloo's "Construction in the Sphere") and pronouncements (e.g., Bill's statement that "I am of the opinion that it is possible to develop an art largely on the basis of mathematical thinking.") Expressionist abstract painting, as practiced by artists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Clyfford Still]], and [[Wols]], represents the opposite of geometric abstraction.

==Relationship with music==

Abstract art has also historically been likened to [[music]] in its ability to convey emotional or expressive feelings and ideas without reliance upon or reference to recognizable objective forms already existent in reality. [[Wassily Kandinsky]] has discussed this connection between music and painting, as well as how the practice of classical composition had influenced his work, at length in his seminal essay ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art''.

[[Image:Water cycle.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[water cycle]], the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth affects how much water evaporates from oceans, and how long it is retained on land]]

The '''Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX)''' is a research program of the [[World Climate Research Programme]] intended to observe, comprehend and [[model (abstract)|model]] the Earth's [[water cycle]]. The experiment also observes how much energy the [[Earth]] receives, studies how much of that energy reaches surfaces of the Earth and how that energy is transformed. [[Sunlight]]'s energy [[evaporate]]s water to produce [[cloud]]s and [[rain]], and  dries out land masses after rain. Rain that falls on land becomes the water budget which can be used by people for [[agricultural]] and other processes.

GEWEX is a collaboration of researchers worldwide to find better ways of studying the water cycle and how it transforms energy through the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref name =  "GEWEX"&gt;[http://www.gewex.org/gewex_overview.html About GEWEX], Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment, World Climate Research Programme , Access date 06-22-2008&lt;/ref&gt; If the Earth's climates were identical from year to year, then people could predict when, where and what crops to plant. However, instability created by solar variation, weather trends, and chaotic events create weather that is unpredictable on seasonal scales. Through weather patterns such as [[drought]]s and higher rainfall these cycles impact [[ecosystem]]s and human activities.  GEWEX is designed to collect a much greater amount of data, and see if better models of that data can forecast weather and climate change into the future.

GEWEX is organized into several structures. As GEWEX was conceived projects were organized by participating factions, this task is now done by the International GEWEX Project Office (IGPO). IGPO oversees major initiatives and coordinates between national projects in an effort to bring about communication of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;NASA is the primary sponsor of IGPO&lt;/ref&gt; IGPO claims to support communication exchange between 2000 scientist and is the instrument for publication of major reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gewex.org/igpo.html International GEWEX Project Office (IGPO)]  GEWEX WCRP&lt;/ref&gt; The Scientific Steering Group organizes the projects and assigns them to panels, which oversee progress and provide critique. The Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project (CEOP) the 'Hydrology Project' is a major instrument in GEWEX.&lt;ref name = "CEOP"/&gt;  This panel includes geographic study areas such as the [[Climate Prediction Program for the Americas]] operated by [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]],&lt;ref&gt;(CPPA integrates what was formally GEWEX American Prediction Project - GAPP and Climate Variability and Predictability, U.S. CLIVAR.) [http://www.climate.noaa.gov/cpo_pa/cppa/ Climate Program Office], National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/ref&gt; but also examines several types of climate zones (e.g. high altitude and semi-arid).&lt;ref name = "CEOP"&gt;[http://www.ceop.net/ Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Another panel, the GEWEX Radiation Panel oversees the coordinated use of satellites and ground-based observation to better estimate energy and water fluxes. One recent result GEWEX's Radiation panel has assessed data on rainfall for the last 25 years and determined that global rainfall is 2.61&amp;nbsp;mm/day with a small [[statistic]]al variation. While the study period is short, after 25 years of measurement regional trends are beginning to appear.&lt;ref name="Precip"&gt;Gruber A and Levizzani V. [http://wcrp.wmo.int/documents/AssessmentGlobalPrecipitationReport.pdf Assessment of Global Precipitation Products] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718163512/http://wcrp.wmo.int/documents/AssessmentGlobalPrecipitationReport.pdf |date=2008-07-18 }} A project of the [[World Climate Research Programme]] Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Radiation Panel, WCRP-128 WMO/TD-No. 1430, May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The GEWEX Modeling and Prediction Panel takes current models and analyzes the models when [[climate forcing]] phenomena occur (global warming as an example of a 'climate forcing' event). GEWEX is now the core project of WCRP.&lt;ref name =  "GEWEX"/&gt;

==Goals and design==
[[Image:Solar-cycle-data.png|thumb|right|To determine energy budget and flux, scientists need to know the amount of radiation reaching the Earth.]]
Predicting weather change requires [[accurate]] data that is collected over many years, and the application of [[computational model|model]]s. GEWEX was conceived to respond to the need for observations of the Earth's [[radiation]] budget and clouds. Many preexisting techniques were limited to observations taken from land and populated areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kandel R.S.  |title= Satellite observation of the Earth Radiation Budget and clouds|journal=Space Science Reviews |volume=52 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–32 |date=February 1990|doi=10.1007/BF00704238 |url= |bibcode=1990SSRv...52....1K}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ignored the large amount of weather that occurs over the oceans and unpopulated regions, with key data missing from these areas. Since satellites orbiting the earth cover large areas in small time frames, they can better estimate climate where measurements are infrequently taken.  GEWEX was initiated by [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP) to take advantage of environmental satellites such as [[TRMM]], but now uses information from newer satellites as well as collections land based instruments, such as [[Baseline Surface Radiation Network|BSRN]].&lt;ref name = "GEWEX"/&gt; These land based instruments can be used to verify information interpreted from satellite.  GEWEX studies the long-term and regional changes in climate with a goal of predicting important [[seasonal]] weather patterns and climate changes that occurs over a few years.

| '''Sunlight and rain'''
|-
| column width = "350px" | The earth is made of matter, including water, which absorbs and emits energy into space. Should the earth not orbit a star, the water would freeze solid and little precipitation would occur because the rate of evaporation would be very low. If the earth were devoid of water, it would heat to great temperatures in the daytime and cool off more quickly at night. Therefore, water modulates heat energy by transitioning between ice, water, and steam. When heat is applied, ice becomes water and water becomes vapor-steam, absorbing heat energy. When cooling is applied, vapor condenses into water and water freezes into ice, releasing heat. While these are simple examples, rainfall results from a complex set of processes. When '''sunlight''' hits the oceans it forces liquid water into the vapor state at a rate dependent on surface temperatures, humidity, winds and pressure. At equilibration, water reaches 100% humidity, and during the day, the temperature rises, allowing more moisture to accumulate in the air. At night the temperature falls and water tends to form clouds, often resulting in ground fog in coastal areas.

At 100% humidity any loss of radiant energy from water causes vapor to condense into water. Circulation and convection can carry moist air upward in the air column, and this often cools moist air. The air forms water droplets, even in the heat of daytime, creating clouds. As the density of droplets in the clouds increase, the air can no longer support droplets and they fall as '''rain'''. More moist air can be drawn into clouds as energy is released, allowing the development of large thunderstorms. Prevailing winds are a factor in storm formation, particularly when changes occur. Tropical waves that develop in westerly flows around the Earth's semitropical and tropical region can organize into horizontal circles over the water, creating a cyclone. [[Image:Hurricane profile.svg|right|thumb|A cyclone showing the flow of moist air as it dissipates energy into the tropopause]]

A cyclone is a stereotype energy transfer system. It gathers steam off of warm water, and quickly moves it upwards releasing the energy into space. This causes the characteristic rain bands. The energy transferred is so great it gives rise to catastrophic winds, which disturb surface waters, increasing steam release, and also increase the rate at which moisture is drawn into the center. The heat of the water under the storm drops. Cyclones demonstrate how much latent energy is stored in the world's oceans.
&lt;br /&gt;
|-
|'''Fluxes, radiation and aerosols'''
|-
| column width = "350px" | The moisture for a cyclone can be defined as the warm water below the storm. As the cyclone leaves warm water its energy dissipates quickly. Less powerful, long-term rainfall generators can rely on moisture driven by warm waters far from greatest region of rainfall. In the tropics the energy came from, stored heat in ocean currents and moving thermoclines can provide sources far away, such as is seen in El-Nino. [[Image:Mississippi Flood 1993.PNG|thumb|left|Soil moisture as a factor in the great flood of 1993]] Another example is the floods that hit the Midwest U.S. in 1993. The energy that drove moisture into the air occurred in the Gulf, and strong winds and lack of cooling in coastal regions permitted the moisture to travel 1000 miles until conditions were ripe for rain. As the rain fell it cooled the air and dissipated heat, and as new moisture arrived, the process continued. When the sun did come out, it heated wet ground, which created more rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dirmeyer | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Brubaker | first2 = K.L. | year = 1999 | title = Contrasting evaporative moisture          sources during the [[drought of 1988]] and the flood of 1993 | url = | journal = J.

When the air reaches land, which may be warmer, there may be inadequate convection and other processes to create rains, and this can cause droughts. To better see these events progress, scientists need data and models to see what elements of the data are most useful in determining rainfall.

===Research goals===

The research interest of GEWEX is to study [[wikt:flux|fluxes]] of radiation at the Earth's surface, predict seasonal hydration levels of soils and develop accurate models of predicting energy and water budgets around the world. The project sets its goal as to improve, by an order of magnitude, the ability to model and therefore prediction hydration (rainfall and evaporation) patterns&lt;ref name =  "GEWEX"/&gt; GEWEX is linked to other WCRP projects such as Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate (SPARC) Project, and the Climate and Cryosphere Project through WCRP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/SPARC/index.html Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://clic.npolar.no/ Climate and Cryosphere (CliC)] World Climate Research Program and Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research&lt;/ref&gt; and thus shares information and goals with other WCRP projects. The goal becomes more important with the newer WCRP project, the [[Coordinated Observation and Prediction of the Earth System]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcrp.ipsl.jussieu.fr/ WCRP STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK 2005-2015] World Climate Research Program,      WCRP Strategic Support Unit, Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complexity of the experiment====
Aside from fluctuations of solar radiation, the sunlight that is transformed by the earth can vary greatly, some have concluded for instance, that ice-ages self-perpetuate once enough ice has accumulated in the polar regions to reflect enough radiation at high elevations to lower the global average temperature, whereas it takes an unusually warm period to reverse this state. Water usage by plants, herbivore activities can change albedo in the temperate and tropical zones. These trends in reflection are subject to change. Some have proposed extrapolating pre-GEWEX information using new information and measurements taken with pre-GEWEX technology.&lt;ref name="ams.allenpress.com"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kinter III JL and Shukla, J | title = The global hydrologic and energy cycles: suggestions for studies in the Pre-GEWEX period | journal = Bull. Amer. Meteor.

There are oscillations in oceanic currents, such as El-Niño and North Atlantic Oscillation, which alter the parts of the Earth's ice mass and land water availability. The experiment takes a sampling of climate, with some trends lasting a million years, and as paleo-climatology shows, can abruptly change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/abrupt/index.html|title=A Paleo Perspective Abrupt Climate Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
GEWEX is being implemented in phases. The first phase comprises information gathering, modeling, predictions, and advancement of observation techniques and is complete. The second phase addresses several scientific questions such as prediction capacity, changes in Earth's water cycle, and impact on water resources.

====First phase====
Phase I (1990–2002), also called the "Build-Up Phase", was designed to determine the hydrological cycle and energy fluxes by means of global measurements of atmospheric and surface properties. GEWEX was also designed to model the global hydrological cycle and its impact on the atmosphere, oceans and land surfaces. Phase I processes were to develop the ability to predict the variations of global and regional hydrological processes &amp; water resources, and their response to environmental change. It was also to advance the development of observing techniques, data management, and assimilation systems for operational application to long-range weather forecasts, hydrology, and climate predictions.

During Phase I GEWEX projects were divided into the three overlapping sectors.
# '''GEWEX Radiation Panel''' ('''GRP''') used satellite and ground-based sensing over long periods to determine to delineate natural variation and climate changing forces.
# '''GEWEX Modelling and Prediction Panel''' ('''GMPP'''): Model the energy and water budget of the earth and determine the predictability. Apply modeling to determine climate forcing events, or respond to climate forcing events by analysis of predictions.
# '''GEWEX Hydrometeorology Panel''' ('''GHP''') - Modeled and predicted changes in water cycle events on longer time scales (up to annual) using intensive regional studies to determine efficacy of data gathering and predictions. The Continental-Scale Experiments (CSEs) relied heavily on the following study areas that would eventually form the basis of the  '''Coordinated Enhanced Observing Period''' ('''CEOP'''):
::* Canada - Mackenzie river basin study area (MAGS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Special Issue on the Mackenzie Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment Studies 1994/95 Water Year|journal=Atmosphere-Ocean |volume=40 |issue=2– (Special Issue) |pages=91–278 |date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; -completed
::* United States - North American study area or GEWEX American Prediction Project(GAPP).
::* Brazil - Large-Scale Biosphere Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA)
::* Scandinavia - Baltic Sea Experiment (BALTEX)
::* Southern Africa - African Monsoon Multidisciplinary  Analysis  Project (AMMA)
::* Indopacific and Asia - GEWEX Asian Monsoon Experiment (GAME) - completed in 2005
::* Australia - Murray-Darling Basin Water Budget Project (MDB)
::But also:
::* Continental-scale - International Project (GCIP)
::* International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP)
CEOP projects interacted with other non-GEWEX projects like CLIVAR and CLiC

=====Results=====
The results of the build-up phase include 15 to 25 years of study, measured the indirect effects of [[aerosol]]s, compiled a correlated data set, some reductions in uncertainty&lt;ref name = "PI_res_Overview"&gt;[http://www.gewex.org/GEWEXAccompBroc.pdf GEWEX Phase I Overview] GEWEX, WCRP&lt;/ref&gt;  GEWEX claims the following accomplishments:  A long period data set of [[cloud]]s, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rain fall]], [[water vapor]], surface radiation, and aerosols with no indication of large global trends, but with evidence of regional variability, models showing increased precipitation, and showed the importance of regional factors, such as water and soil conservation in regional climate change. The Phase I also claims to have produced over 200 publications and 15 review articles.

The Mississippi watershed was part of the GEWEX Continental scale International Projects and as a result was well situated for the  analysis of the Great Flood of 1993 ([[Mississippi River]] and [[Red River Valley|Red River]] water sheds). The coordination between ground sensing observations and satellite information allowed more thorough analysis of events that led up to the flood. Researchers at the [[Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies]] (COLA) found that upstream [[soil moisture]] and a multifold increase of [[humidity|moist]] air flow from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the flooded regions was a major factor in excessive rainfall. The Global Land/Atmosphere System Study (GLASS) gave GEWEX investigators the ability to observe soil wetness over much of the worlds surface by correlating observations on the ground with information obtained by satellites. While the ability to show cause is important, the different conditions (soil wetness, global patterns) that were permissive for weather anomalies are the focus of Phase I, gathering information and learning how to use satellite information better.

[[Image:Aerosol mod 2006.jpg|thumb|left|Aerosol map from 2006 showing increased aerosols, likely fires, in developing countries]]

One of the biggest impact of the Aerosol analysis has been the demonstration of the fairly large impact of anthropogenic aerosols, smoke patterns, even daily ripples of aerosols can be observed off the coasts of some developing nations and extend hundreds of miles over surrounding oceans. Some have questioned whether this aerosol pollution is partly to blame for long-term drought in places like the African [[Sahel]].

=====Critique=====
One critique of the Build-up Phase data and predictions is that there needs to be better error descriptions. The global estimate of rainfall indicates that the [[confidence interval|confidence range]] is large relative to possible [[Trend estimation|trend]]s. The number of ground sensing stations (currently around 40) in the [[#Baseline Surface Radiation Network|BSRN]] is rather limited for global observation this affected the measurement of aerosols which are regionally dominant. The best measurements of aerosol pollution are obtained when cloud types are identified properly by satellite observation, therefore better cloud sensing strategies and models are need to provide the clearest real time data. Certain projects like GCIP allow have focused on continental scale observations provide better prediction for project areas; however, areas outside these project areas may lag in receiving forecasting improvements. Many of the deficiencies in Phase I are improvement areas within the objectives of Phase II of the project.&lt;ref name = "PI_res_Overview"/&gt; Currently scientist use NASA Aqua's Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) to evaluation soil moisture from space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2004/0729soilshowdown.html  ''Scientists' showdown with soil moisture at the O.K. corral''] Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA, July 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, except for focused observations the satellites data is not useful for global weather prediction. The proposed [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite]] would provide the detail of soil moisture information on a daily basis may provide the data needed for real time forecasting.&lt;ref name = "EGU2008-A-01922"&gt;Mecklenburg S, Kerr Y, Font J and Hahne A. [http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU2008/01922/EGU2008-A-01922.pdf?PHPSESSID= ''The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Mission - An overview'']. Geophysical Research Abstracts, Vol. 10, 2008,&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second phase====
Phase II, "Full Implementation" (2003–2012) of GEWEX is to "exploit new capabities" developed during phase I such as new satellite information and, increasingly, new models. These include changes in the Earth's energy budget and water cycle, contribution of processes in climate feedback, causes of natural variability, predicting changes on a seasonal or annual  timescales, and how changes impact water resources. Phase II of is designed to be active models that have use to regional resource managers in real time. Some phases, such as the GAME (GEWEX Asia Monsoon Experiment) are already completed .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyarc.nagoya-u.ac.jp/game/ GEWEX Asia Monsoon Experiment]&lt;/ref&gt; GEWEX has become an umbrella program for the coordination of studies and experiments around the world. Reports from the phase I are still being produced and it will be some time before the results of the second phase are available. The experiment is still in progress.

==Panels==
There are three panels in GEWEX: The Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project(CEOP), GEWEX Radiation Panel(GRP), and GEWEX Modeling and Prediction Panel(GMPP)

==Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project==
The Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project ('''CEOP''') is the largest of the panel projects. There are several regional project areas  most of these are now covered by CEOP

===Areas===
For CEOP which survey the hydroclimate for southern African (AMMA), Baltic Sea area (BALTEX), North America (CPPA), Eastern Amazonia (LBA), La Plate Basin (LBB), Asia (MAHASRI), Australia (MDB), and Northern Eurasia (NEEPSI).&lt;ref name = "CEOP"/&gt; In addition, CEOP coordinates the study of region types, such as cold, high altitude, monsoon, and semiarid climates&lt;ref name = "CEOP"/&gt; and collects and formulates modeling on global, regional scale including land surface and surface hydrology  modeling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gewex.org/islscp.html International Satellite Land         Surface Climatology Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Since GEWEX is an international cooperation it can utilize information from existing and planned satellites.

===Objectives===
The CEOP project has a number of energy budget and water cycle objectives. First is to produce more consistent research with better error definitions. Second is to better determine how energy flux and water cycles involve in feedback mechanisms. Third is to the predictability of important variables and improved parametric analysis to better model these processes. Forth, to collaborate with other hydrological science projects to create tools for assessing the water-system consequences of predictions and global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceop.net/ See Objectives CEOP/GEWEX]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Atmospheric Transmission.png|thumb|350px|right|Transformation of radiation that reaches the earth, the Red line indicates radiation that reaches the outer atmosphere, whereas the painted red area is the radiation as it reaches the surface, Aerosols can lower this even more]]

===GEWEX Radiation Panel===
GEWEX Radiation panel ('''GRP''') is a collaborative organization with a goal of reviewing theoretical and experimental knowledge of radiative processes within the climate system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grp.giss.nasa.gov/objectives.html  Objectives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705113459/http://grp.giss.nasa.gov/objectives.html |date=2008-07-05 }} Gewex Radiation Panel&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty percent of the energy that comes to Earth from the Sun is transformed by the earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bsrn.ethz.ch/ Background] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515125716/http://bsrn.ethz.ch/ |date=2008-05-15 }} Baseline Surface Radiation Network&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kiehl, J. T., and K. E.

Bull. Amer. Met. Soc., 78, 197-208&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of this collaboration is to determine how energy is transformed as it inevitably is radiated back into space.

====Global precipitation climatology project====
GPCP task was to estimate precipitation using satellites that was global including places where people were not present to take measurements. Secondarily the project was tasked with studying regional precipitation on seasonal to between year time scales. As the study period of the project increased past 25 years a third objective was added analyze long-term variation, such as that caused by [[global warming]]. Also, in a renewed effort for better data and with more observation satellites, the GPCP, hopes to gain insights to rainfall variation on 'weather'-scale, or 4-hour periods to daily time scales.&lt;ref name = "Precip" /&gt;

=====Precipitation Assessment Group=====
The Precipitation Assessment Group was assigned by the panel to evaluate data on precipitation emphasizing data in the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) product (GRP project).  The GRP prepares to assimilate data from GPCP diurnal variation data for better estimation of the global precipitation products.&lt;ref name="Precip" /&gt; The result of 25 years of measurement the global average precipitation rate is 2.61&amp;nbsp;mm per/day (about 0.1&amp;nbsp;inch/day) with about 1% uncertainty. The finding suggests there is no significant variation in mean annual rainfall.&lt;ref name="Precip" /&gt; Regional variation was separated from land and ocean and the land variation of received precipitation was greater than the ocean. Satellites used to train the dataset analysis have the flaw of not having inaccurate measurements of drizzle and snow, and lack measurements in isolated places and over oceans. The rainfall maps show the greatest absolute rainfall error over the tropical oceans in regions with the highest estimated rainfall. The report self-critiques two aspects: the lack of polar-crossing satellites at the beginning of the study and the inability to correlate new information and older information (ground-based measurements). The noticeable trends in the dataset were deemed insignificant with regard to issues like global warming, but some stand-out positive trends over the Indopacific region were notable (Bay of Bengal and Indochina) and negative trends over South Central [[Africa]].
[[Image:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|350px|left|A goal of GEWEX is to monitor radiation that is released at the '''top of the atmosphere''' and model how energy flows from earth surfaces back into space.]]

====Surface Radiation Budget project====
The SRB project under NASA/GEWEX took global radiation measurements to determine radiative energy fluxes. The energy that comes from the sun strikes the atmosphere and scatters, clouds and is reflected, the earth or water where heat and light are radiated back into the atmosphere or space. When water is struck heated surface water can evaporate carrying energy back into space through cloud formation and rain. The SRB project measured these processes by measuring fluxes at the Earth's surface, top-of-atmosphere with shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiation.

====Baseline Surface Radiation Network====
At the onset of GEWEX there was inadequate information on how radiation redistributed, both horizontally and vertically.

[[Baseline Surface Radiation Network|BSRN]] is a global system of less than 40 widely spread radiation measuring devices designed to measure changes in radiation at the Earth's surface. The information obtained is stored at the World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) at the ETH (Zurich).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bsrn.ethz.ch/ Baseline Surface Radiation Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515125716/http://bsrn.ethz.ch/ |date=2008-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global Aerosol Climatology Project====
Established by Radiation Sciences Program(NASA) and GEWEX in 1998 to analyze satellite and field data to determine the distribution of aerosols, how they are formed, transformed and transported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gacp.giss.nasa.gov/ Global Aerosol Climatology Project] Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NASA&lt;/ref&gt;

====GEWEX Cloud Assessment Project====
The GEWEX cloud assessment was initiated by the GEWEX Radiation Panel (GRP) in 2005 to evaluate the reliability of available, global, long-term cloud data products, with a special emphasis on ISCCP. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stubenrauch|first=Claudia|author2=GEWEX Cloud Assessment Team|title=Assessment of Global Cloud Datasets from Satellites: Project and Database Initiated by the GEWEX Radiation Panel|journal=Bull. Amer. Meteor. Soc.|date=2013|volume=94|pages=1031–1049|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00117.1|doi=10.1175/bams-d-12-00117.1|bibcode = 2013BAMS...94.1031S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GEWEX Modeling and Prediction Panel===
The GEWEX modeling and prediction panel ('''GMPP''') is charged with the task of finding better ways to use the data by other projects and other agencies. It oversees GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS), GEWEX Cloud System Study (GCSS),  and  Global Land/Atmosphere System Study(GLASS).  Climate forcing is a process of study which observes the contribution of irregular events, such a volcano eruption, greenhouse warming, solar variation, fluctuations in the Earth's orbit, long-term variation in the oceans circulation. The GMPP exploits these natural perturbations to test models developed that should predict what happens to global energy and water budgets with the perturbations.

====GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study====
GEWEX Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study ('''GABLS''') is a more recent addition to GEWEX. The study is tasked with understanding the physical properties of the atmospheric boundary layers for better models which include representation of boundary layers.

====GEWEX Cloud System Study====
GEWEX Cloud System Study ('''GCSS''') task is to individualize modeling for different types of cloud systems. GCSS identifies 5 types of cloud systems:boundary layer, cirrus, extra tropical layer, precipitating convective, and polar. These cloud systems are generally too small to be rationalized in large scale climate modeling, this results in inadequate development of equations resulting in greater statistical uncertainty in results. In order to rationalize these process the study observes cloud systems at single fixed positions on earth in order to better estimate their parameters. These four areas are: Azores and Madeira Islands, Barbados, Equatorial Western Pacific, and Atlantic Tropics. The initial data collection is complete, methods developed for land and aircraft based observations can be compared with satellite observations to that better models of cloud system identification can be made at smaller scales.

====Global Land/Atmosphere System Study====
Global Land/Atmosphere System Study('''GLASS''') tries to understand the impact on land surface parameters on atmosphere.  Changes in land as a result of natural and man-made activities results in the ability to alter local climate and affect wind and cloud formation.

===Critique===
 [[File:Winter-NAO-Index.svg|thumb|left|350px|The period of the North Atlantic Oscillation lasts several times longer than the length of the proposed time frame of the GEWEX study]]
The study period for GEWEX is 22 years, and while some climate oscillations are short, such as El-Nino, some climate oscillations last for decades, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation.&lt;ref&gt;''The North Atlantic Oscillation Climate Significance and Environmental Impacts'', J.W. Hurrell, Y. Kushnir, G. Ottersen, and M. Visbeck (Eds), Geophysical Monograph Series, 134, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Some have proposed extrapolating pre-GEWEX information using new information and measurements taken with pre-GEWEX technology.&lt;ref name="ams.allenpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940030849_1994030849.pdf ''Production of Global Long-Term Water data. Annual report'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The MAGS project, located in Northwestern Canada utilized indigenous peoples traditional experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Woo M  | title = Science Meets Traditional Knowledge: Water and Climate in the Sahtu (Great Bear Lake) Region, Northwest Territories, Canada | journal = Arctic | issue = 1 | pages = 37–46 | date = 2007 | pmid =  | doi = 10.14430/arctic263 |name-list-format=vanc| author2 = Modeste P | author3 = Blondin  | url = http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3143/Arctic60-1-37.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in other parts of the GEWEX study, these oscillations are an aspect of climate forcing, which allow testing of predictions and models. This modeling may be complicated by the fact that the North Atlantic Oscillation in switching state (see graph) as the effects of global warming are becoming more prominent. For example, 2006 and 2007 saw one of the most dramatic declines in Arctic Sea ice, a decline that was largely unpredicted and can shift the late summer albedo in the northern hemisphere. In 2008, sea ice extent decline has backed off from the previous years' trend, and researchers had forecast a strong La Nina event for late 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climate.the-environmentalist.org/2008/01/2008-temperature-prediction.html ''2008 Temperature Prediction''] Climate on The Environmentalist. The Environmentalist&lt;/ref&gt; However, unexpectedly the surface temperatures in the Eastern Pacific have already begun to rise to El-Nino temperature ranges, indicating the La Nina event may terminate unexpectedly. With this the loss of Northern Polar sea ice has begun to accelerate back toward the earlier trend. Such rapid and unexpected changes in climate-forcing events eventually suggest that modelers need to include parameters such as ocean temperature thermoclines, energy accumulation in the tropical oceans, sea ice extents in the polar regions, land glacial ice retraction in Greenland, and sheet ice and shelf ice remodeling in Antarctica. When multiple climate-forcing influences are acting simultaneously in which one of the events will eventually take dominance, lack of precedents from the past study of similar confluences of events, as well as knowledge of the uncertainty of sensitive 'switches' in the oceanic/atmospheric switches may affect the ability to provide accurate models and predictions. In addition, sampling points may be spread to monitor leading indicators in one common scenario may be useless during an oscillation where the pool of energy shifts to an unmonitored region so that the magnitude of the shift avoids computation.

[[Image:La Nina and Pacific Decadal Anomalies - April 2008.png|thumb|right|350px|Anomalies in April 2008. Note while the central Pacific tropics are under La-Nina, the Eastern Pacific is warming]] 
An example of climate-forcing anomalies might be used to describe the events of 1998 to 2002, a strong El-Nino/La Nina cycle. The onset of the cycle can be influenced by global warming, which facilitated a larger increase of warm water in the tropics, rapidly enough that the thermocline was tolerant. A thermocline is a sharp temperature drop at depth; it varies during the year, with location, and over long periods of time. As the thermocline depth increases El-Nino events are more likely; however, during the peak of the event energy is dissipated and the thermocline decreases depth, possibly to below normal levels so the a strong La-Nina event can results. The world's oceans, particularly the depths of the Atlantic, are believed to be a sink for {{CO2}} that is adsorbed at the polar regions, as this builds into the Pacific the upwelling and warming of water can bring {{CO2}}-rich waters trapped in the cold pressurized bottom layers to the surface. Local increases of {{CO2}} occur which allow more heat trapping; the La-Nina may be mild or aborted early in the process. However, if the return of the thermocline has enough momentum it could propel a strong La-Nina event that last for a few years. However, rapid cooling in the Arctic can allow for more {{CO2}} trapping and offset release of {{CO2}} during La-Nina in a specific area. The Pacific Decadal Anomaly (PDA See image) may influence the source, direction or momentum of rise of the cold water component of the thermocline.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=18012 La Nina and Pacific Decadal Oscillation Cool the Pacific] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602054936/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=18012 |date=2008-06-02 }} Earth Observatory Newsroom, NASA&lt;/ref&gt; The extent and duration of the PDA are yet unpredictable, and its modulating effects on El-Nino/La-Nina patterns can only be speculated. These unknowns affect the ability for climate modelers to predict and indicate climate-forcing models need to accurate a wider sampling of data to be predictive.

[[Image:Milankovitch Variations.png|thumb|left|350px|Scientist still don't know which of these cycles determines the onset of ice-ages and interglacial, were we headed into an ice-age or 50,000 years from now, see [[Milankovitch cycles]]]] There are also longer term cycles, the [[mini ice-age]] that preceded the [[medieval warm period]] may have been a transition to an ice age, the last ice-age lasted from ~130,000 years ago until the onset of the Holocene. This ice-age may have been aborted by other factors including global warming. Such a stalling of long-term cycles is believed to be a factor in the Dryas period, a warming interrupted by surface impacts of extraterrestrial origin may have occurred over hundreds of years.  But the anthropogenic greenhouse effects and changing insolation patterns may have unpredictable long-term effects. Reductions of glacial ice on land masses can cause isotatic rebounds, and may affect earthquakes and volcanism over a wide range. Rising sea levels can also affect patterns, and was seen in Indonesia, simply drilling a gas well in the wrong place may have touched off a mud volcano and there are some signs that this may precede a new caldera formation for a volcano. Over the very long term, the change in temperature of the Earth's crust on geothermal and volcanic processes is unknown. How this plays into climate-forcing events with magnitudes that are unpredictable is unknown.

The critiques at GEWEX can only be thrust at current results, which have added much more information about climate modeling that have created critiques, the major thrust of modeling was originally intended to be part of Phase II which will, after 4 years, produce its results. One of the major critiques of GEWEX phase I was land based measurements, which are now increasing. The other major critique is the inability to capture decadal rainfall events, events that frequently occur over a few hours. Therefore, more measurements documenting shorter time frames may provide essential data for almost continuous data set. Therefore, Phase II is mainly modeling with addition of more data as deemed lacking in Phase I. Many of the critiques above may be compensated for with better data requiring better models including insolation and changes in reflection. The problem with variation in ocean currents, particular with respect to thermocline depths requires more oceanography as part of the project, as with losses of ice and changes of climate on the ice edges.

He curated the major exhibit "Facing History: The Black Image in American Art 1710-1940" which dealt with the image of African-Americans in American art.

==Early life and education==
Guy C. McElroy was the son of Geraldine (née Woods) and George E. McElroy, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geraldine McElroy  Obituary  - Fairmont, West Virginia - Tributes.com|url=http://www.tributes.com/obituary/show/Geraldine-McElroy-89243121|website=www.tributes.com|accessdate=27 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised in his native Fairmont, West Virginia McElroy earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from local [[Fairmont State University|Fairmont State College]] in 1970. After he earned a master's degree in art history from the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1972, he acquired a second Master's in Mass Communications from Boston's [[Emerson College]] in 1975.

He held the position of [[Rockefeller Fellow]] in Museum Studies at the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]] from 1974 to 1975. He followed that position with several assistant curator roles in West and East Coast public galleries and museums. Beginning in 1978 McElroy spent 10 years at Washington, DC's [[Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site|Bethune Museum-Archive]], first as curator and then as assistant director. It was as adjunct curator of the Corcoran Gallery where he completed his work on "Facing History."

Becoming a quadriplegic after a 1987 New Mexico automobile accident, McElroy began using a wheelchair.

He died at 44, only five months after initial publication of the catalog for "Facing History,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McElroy|first1=Guy C.|last2=Gates|first2=Henry Louis|last3=Art|first3=Corcoran Gallery of|last4=Museum|first4=Brooklyn|title=Facing history: the Black image in American art, 1710-1940|publisher=Bedford Arts|isbn=9780938491385|page=vi|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Facing_history.html?id=1d1PAAAAMAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;" from a pulmonary embolism at [[George Washington University Hospital]] in Washington, DC having nearly completed a Ph.D. in art history from the [[University of Maryland]].

==Facing History==
"Facing History: The Black Image in American Art, 1710-1940," was the first public display by a major museum to showcase depictions of [[African-Americans]] in American art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kastor|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Kastor|first2=Elizabeth|title=GUY MCELROY, FACING HIS FUTURE|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1990/01/14/guy-mcelroy-facing-his-future/77b55f94-9116-4a11-92ff-905e3bc2c852/|accessdate=25 February 2017|work=The Washington Post|date=14 January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show examined ways in which American artists "reinforced a number of largely restrictive stereotypes of black identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guy C.

Both works by approximately 80&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=BOLLE|first1=SONJA|title=FACING HISTORY  by Guy C.

In McElroy's view these works depict the attitude of society toward African-Americans through the works themselves and the response they received in the marketplace. The works make overt political statements, as well as, address contemporary issues. Stereotypes, slavery and violence dominate the images. But as McElroy states in the show's catalog:

{{quote frame |quote=Depictions of black people can no longer rely on gross distortions of physiognomy or character to achieve racially motivated humor, but the symbolic power of visual images remains insidious. Jim Crow, Uncle Tom, Mammy, the Comic Darkey and Zip Coon no longer dominate images of African-Americans in painting and sculpture, but their ghosts live on in a host of popular mediums, most notably in the violence of action serials and the stereotyped behavior of television sitcoms.|author=Guy C.

==Citation style==
{{Main|Vancouver system}}

The citation style recommended by the ICMJE Recommendations, which is also known as the [[Vancouver system]], is the style used by the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (NLM), codified in ''[[Citing Medicine]]''.

References are numbered consecutively in order of appearance in the text&amp;nbsp;– they are identified by [[Arabic numerals]] enclosed in [[bracket|parentheses]].

Example of a journal citation:

==Manuscripts describing human interventional clinical trials==
URM includes a mandate for manuscripts describing human interventional trials to register a trial in a clinical trial registry (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov) and to include the trial registration ID in the abstract of the article. The URM also requires that this registration is done prior enrolling the first participant. A study of five high impact factor journals (founders of [[ICMJE]]) showed that only 89% of published articles (articles published during   2010-2011; about trials that completed in 2008) were properly registered prior enrolling the first participant.&lt;ref name=adherence&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huser | first1 = V. | last2 = Cimino | first2 = J.

==Disclosure of Competing Interests==
The ICMJE also developed a uniform format for disclosure of competing interests in journal articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Drazen JM, Van der Weyden MB, Sahni P, Rosenberg J, Marusic A, Laine C, Kotzin S, Horton R, Hébert PC, Haug C, Godlee F, Frizelle FA, de Leeuw PW, DeAngelis CD |title=Uniform format for disclosure of competing interests in ICMJE journals |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=361 |issue=19 |pages=1896–7 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19825973 |doi=10.1056/NEJMe0909052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ideological criticism''' is a method in [[rhetorical criticism]] concerned with critiquing texts for the dominant ideology they express while silencing opposing or contrary [[ideologies]]. It was started by a group of scholars roughly in the late-1970s through the mid-1980s at universities in the United States. Leading scholars of ideological criticism were Michael Calvin McGee at the University of Iowa and Phillip Wander at San Jose State University. Wander's 1983 article, "The Ideological Turn in Modern Criticism,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=Philip|date=March 1983|title=The ideological turn in modern criticism|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10510978309368110?journalCode=rcst19|journal=Central States Speech Journal|language=en|volume=34|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/10510978309368110|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his 1984 article, "The Third Persona: An Ideological Turn in Rhetorical Theory,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wander|first=Philip|date=December 1984|title=The third persona: An ideological turn in rhetorical theory|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10510978409368190|journal=Central States Speech Journal|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=197–216|doi=10.1080/10510978409368190|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt; remain two of the most important articles in the field. According to Sonja Foss, “the primary goal of the ideological critic is to discover and make visible the dominant ideology or ideologies embedded in an artifact and the ideologies that are being muted in it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice (3rd ed.)|last=Foss|first=|publisher=Waveland Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Long Grove, Illinois|pages=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Foss has also mentioned the contribution to ideological criticism of several theoretical schools, including [[Marxism]], [[structuralism]], [[cultural studies]], and [[postmodernism]].

==Ideograph==
A unit of analysis in ideological criticism, or what Foss calls "traces of ideology in an artifact," is the [[ideograph (rhetoric)|ideograph]].  It is a symbol representing an ideological concept and is more than what the symbol itself depicts.  Michael McGee, a renowned ideological critic, postulated that an “ideograph is an ordinary term found in political discourse” that “is a high-order abstraction representing collective commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal”.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|pp=462–463}}  Thus, McGee restricted ideographs to [[words]], words that “constitute a vocabulary of public motives, which authorize and warrant public actions”.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|p=479}}  McGee encourages the study of ideographs (such as “[[liberty]]” and “[[Political freedom|freedom]]”) to help identify the ideological position of a [[society]].  He argues such terms are used in [[discourse]] as a means of justifying problematic issues within a society.  The meaning of an ideograph is defined by a society and its [[culture]] and can change over time.  Ideographs need not be only positive in nature, but can be negative as well.  For example, [[Tyrant|tyranny]] and [[slavery]], can “guide behavior and belief negatively by branding unacceptable behavior."  McGee notes that to fully understand ideographs, they must be examined both “[[Historical linguistics|diachronically]]” as well as “[[Synchronic analysis|synchronically]].”  That is, ideographs need to be examined across time to determine how their meanings may have changed and all ideographs that are used in a given situation must be considered.

Who in [[democracy]] would be opposed to actions taken under the auspices of liberty and freedom?  To do so would, ideographically speaking, be undemocratic. Citizens of a democratic state are “conditioned” to believe that liberty and freedom are so fundamentally important that society expects those citizens to simply unquestioningly accept actions claiming to be in defense of liberty and freedom.  For example, even within the United States, the ideograph of freedom has changed.  At the time of the [[American Revolutionary War|American War of Independence]] (1775–1783), freedom meant breaking away from the tyrannical rule of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].  Today, freedom means many things including the freedom to pursue one's dreams and the freedom to be left alone.  People disagree about the freedoms that are most important: freedom to possess guns, freedom to make decisions that affect one's body, freedom from fear or violence, and freedom of movement.  Depending on one's ideological orientation, the ideograph of freedom represents many things, which is why it can be so powerfully used by politicians.  Ideographs succeed in political discourse because of their inability to be concretely understood.  

Ideographs need not be [[Linguistics|verbal]] only; they can be [[Visual communication|visual]] too.  In 1997, Janis Edwards and Carol Winkler expanded the idea of the ideograph to include visual images as well as written words.{{Sfn|Edwards and Winkler 1997|pp=289–310}}  They argue images can act as “a Visual reference point that forms the basis of arguments about a variety of themes and subjects” that are used by both “[[elite]]s and non-elites” alike.{{Sfn|Burgchardt|2005|pp=487–508}}  Like McGee’s textual ideographs, visual ideographs depict common values and goals in a given culture, recur in different contexts over time, and are used to validate arguments and [[Social practice theory|social practice]]s.  Edwards and Winkler mention images of people can act as ideographs too.  “In their construct, a person (character) is abstracted and elevated to the status of a cultural figure, and becomes a surface for the articulation of the political character, employing cultural ideals”.  Foss identifies the following steps in a piece of ideological criticism: 1) “formulate a [[research question]] and select an [[Social artifact|artifact]]”; 2) “select a [[unit of analysis]]” (which she calls “traces of ideology in an artifact”); 3) “analyze the artifact” (which, according to Foss, involves identifying the ideology in the artifact, analyzing the interests the ideology serves, and uncovering the strategies used in the artifact to promote the ideology); and 4) “write the critical essay”.

[[File:Wilcox.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] (1863–1935)]]

An '''illustration''' is a decoration, interpretation or visual explanation of a text, concept or process,&lt;ref&gt;cf. the freely available international [http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/hi/gnt/dsi Database of Scientific Illustrators 1450-1950] with 20 search fields and nearly 7000 entries of illustrators in science, medicine &amp; technology active prior to 1950&lt;/ref&gt; designed for integration in published media, such as posters, flyers, magazines, books, teaching materials, animations, video games and films.

The origin of the word “illustration” is late Middle English (in the sense ‘illumination; spiritual or intellectual enlightenment’): via Old French from Latin ''illustratio(n- )'', from the verb ''illustrate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/illustration|title=Oxford Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary illustration uses a wide range of styles and techniques, including [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]], [[collage]], [[Photomontage|montage]], [[digital design]], [[multimedia]], [[3D modelling]]. Most illustrators work on a freelance basis. 

Depending on the purpose, illustration may be expressive, stylised, realistic or highly technical.

[[Technical illustration|Technical]] and [[scientific illustration]] communicates information of a technical or scientific nature. This may include [[Exploded-view drawing|exploded view]]s, [[Cutaway drawing|cutaways]], fly-throughs, reconstructions, instructional images, component designs, [[diagrams]]. The aim is "to generate expressive images that effectively convey certain information via the visual channel to the human observer"&lt;ref name="ViGr05"&gt;Ivan Viola and Meister E. Gröller (2005). "[http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2005/Viola-05-Smart/Viola-05-Smart-Paper.pdf Smart Visibility in Visualization]". In: ''Computational Aesthetics in Graphics, Visualization and Imaging''. L. Neumann et al. (Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical and scientific illustration is generally designed to describe or explain subjects to a nontechnical audience, so must provide "an overall impression of what an object is or does, to enhance the viewer's interest and understanding".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industriegrafik.com/TIE1.htm Industriegrafik.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814125052/http://www.industriegrafik.com/TIE1.htm |date=2009-08-14 }} website, Last modified: June 15, 2002. Accessed february 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary illustration practice, 2D and 3D software is often used to create accurate representations that can be updated easily, and reused in a variety of contexts.

== Illustration as fine art ==
[[File:Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing. William Blake. c.1786.jpg|thumb|''Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing'' by [[William Blake]] (1786) ]]

In the art world, illustration has at times been considered of less importance than [[graphic design]] and fine art.

Today, however, due in part to the growth of [[graphic novel]] and [[video game]] industries, as well as increased use of illustration in magazines and other publications, illustration is now becoming a valued art form, capable of engaging a global market.

Original illustration art has been known to attract high prices at auction. The US artist [[Norman Rockwell]]'s painting "Breaking Home Ties" sold in a 2006 [[Sotheby's]] auction for USD15.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/media/norman-rockwell-art-rises-in-value-and-his-museum-gets-priced-o/19366251/ Norman Rockwell's Rising Value Prices Out His Museum] Zac Bissonnette, AOL Daily Finance, 2-22-10&lt;/ref&gt; Many other illustration genres are equally valued, with pinup artists such as [[Gil Elvgren]] and [[Alberto Vargas]], for example, also attracting high prices.

[[File:Fire-setting.jpg|thumb|An engraving by [[Georgius Agricola]] or [[Georgius Agricola|Georg Bauer]] (1494–1555), illustrating the mining practice of [[fire-setting]] ]]

Historically, the art of illustration is closely linked to the industrial processes of [[printing]] and [[publishing]].

=== Early history ===

The illustrations of medieval [[codices]] were known as [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminations]], and were individually hand drawn and painted. With the invention of the [[printing press]] during the 15th century, [[books]] became more widely distributed, often illustrated with [[woodcuts]].

1600s Japan saw the origination of [[Ukiyo-e]], an influential illustration style characterised by expressive line, vivid colour and subtle tones, resulting from the ink-brushed [[woodblock printing in Japan|wood block printing]] technique. Subjects included traditional folk tales, popular figures and every day life. [[Hokusai]]’s ''The Great Wave of Kanazawa'' is a famous image of the time.

During the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe, the main reproduction processes for illustration were [[engraving]] and [[etching]]. In 18th Century England, a notable illustrator was [[William Blake]] (1757–827), who used [[relief etching]]. By the early 19th century, the introduction of [[lithography]] substantially improved reproduction quality.

=== 19th Century ===

In Europe, notable figures of the early 19th Century were [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], [[George Cruikshank]], [[Dickens]] illustrator [[Hablot Knight Browne]], and, in France, [[Honoré Daumier]]. All contributed to both satirical and “serious” publications. At this time, there was a great demand for [[caricature]] drawings encapsulating social mores, types and classes.

The British humorous magazine [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] (1841–2002) built on the success of Cruikshank's [[Comic Almanac]] (1827–1840) and employed many well-regarded illustrators, including Sir [[John Tenniel]], the [[Dalziel Brothers]], and [[George du Maurier|Georges du Maurier]]. Although all fine art trained, their reputations were gained primarily as illustrators.

Historically, Punch was most influential in the 1840s and 1850s. The magazine was the first to use the term "[[cartoon]]" to describe a humorous illustration and its widespread use led to [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]] being known as the world's first "[[cartoonist]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Punch Magazine Changed Everything|url=http://illustrationchronicles.com/How-Punch-Magazine-Changed-Everything|website=Illustration Chronicles|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In common with similar magazines such as the Parisian [[Le Voleur]], Punch realised good illustration sold as well as good text. With publication continuing into the 21st Century, Punch chronicles a gradual shift in popular illustration, from reliance on caricature to sophisticated topical observation.

=== The "Golden Age" ===

From the early 1800s [[newspaper]]s, mass market [[magazine]]s, and illustrated books had become the dominant consumer media in Europe and the New World. By the 19th century, improvements in printing technology freed illustrators to experiment with color and rendering techniques. These developments in printing effected all areas of literature from cookbooks, photography and traveling guides, as well as children's books. Also, due to advances in printing, it became more affordable to produce color photographs within books and other materials. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Books: A Living History|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2011|isbn=9780500291153|location=London|pages=193-196}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900, almost 100 percent of paper was machine-made, and while a person working by hand could produce 60-100lbs of paper per day, mechanization yielded around 1,000lbs per day.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Broadview Anthology of Victorian Prose: 1832- 1901|last=Leighton|first=Mary Elizabeth|last2=Surridge|first2=Lisa|publisher=Broadview Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Peterborough, ON|pages=14|chapter=Victorian Print Media and the Reading Public}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the 50 year period between 1846 and 1916, book production increased 400% and the price of books was cut in half.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In [[America]], this led to a "golden age of illustration" from before the 1880s until the early 20th century. A small group of illustrators became highly successful, with the imagery they created considered a portrait of American aspirations of the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafoxsociety.com/what-was-the-golden-age-of-illustration/ The R. Atkinson Fox Society: What Was the Golden Age of Illustration?]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the best known illustrators of that period were [[N. C. Wyeth|N.C. Wyeth]] and [[Howard Pyle]] of the [[Brandywine School]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], and [[James Montgomery Flagg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1368">'''Judenporzellan''' (literally "Jewish Porcelain") is a designation for inferior [[porcelain]] produced by the [[Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin|Royal Porcelain Factory]] owned by [[Frederick the Great]] in the late 18th century. In order to increase business, he decreed in 1769 that a tax on Jews in the form of coerced purchases from his factory would be levied on Jews in order to obtain marriage, death, business and other certificates and permits (Glueck 1998). Some accounts claim that the twenty porcelain monkeys belonging to the heirs of [[Moses Mendelssohn]] (1729–1786) are Judenporzellan (Hartmann 2006), although some authorities doubt the authenticity of these family stories based on chronology and provenance—at least one of the monkeys is of [[Meissen]] manufacture (Todd 2003).

{{Critical pedagogy}}'''''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''''' is a 1977 book on [[education]], written by [[Great Britain|British]] social scientist and [[Cultural studies|cultural theorist]] [[Paul Willis]]. A [[Columbia University Press]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;edition, titled the "Morningside Edition," was published in the [[United States]] shortly after its reception.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning to Labor: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs|last=Willis|first=Paul|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1981|isbn=0-231-05357-6|location=New York, NY|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Willis's first major book, ''Learning to Labour'' relates the findings of his [[Ethnography|ethnographic study]] of [[Working class|working-class]] boys at a [[secondary school]] in [[England]]. In it, Willis attempts to explain the role of [[Youth|youths']] [[culture]] and [[socialization]] as mediums by which schools route working-class students into working-class jobs. [[Stanley Aronowitz]], in the preface to the Morningside edition, hails the book as a key text in [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[social reproduction]] theory about education, advancing previous work in education studies by [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] and [[Herbert Gintis|Herbert Gintis's]] [[Schooling in Capitalist America: Educational Reform and the Contradictions of Economic Life|Schooling in Capitalist America]], as well as work by [[Michael Apple]] and [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

''Learning to Labour'' has been recognized by [[Sociology|sociologists]], [[Critical pedagogy|critical pedagogues]], and researchers in education studies as a landmark study of schooling and culture, and is one of the most cited sociological texts in education studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Learning to Labor in New Times|last=Dolby|first=Nadine|last2=Dimitriadis|first2=Greg|last7=|publisher=Routledge Falmer|year=2004|isbn=0-415-94854-1|editor-last=Dolby|editor-first=Nadine|location=New York, NY|pages=1–2|chapter=Learning to Labor in New Times: An Introduction|quote=|editor-last2=Dimitriadis|editor-first2=Greg|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Arnot, Madeleine. "Male Working-Class Identities and Social Justice: A Reconsideration of Paul Willis's ''Learning to Labor'' in Light of Contemporary Research." ''Learning to Labor in New Times''. pp. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
''Learning to Labour'' represents Paul Willis's ethnographic [[Field research|fieldwork]] with twelve [[Working class|working-class]] British male students, attending their second-to-last year of schooling at "Hammertown Boys," a modern, boys-only school in a town in [[The Midlands|the British Midlands]]. Beginning in 1972, Willis followed the boys for about six months, observing their social behavior with each other and their school and interviewing them periodically. He also studied them at later points up until 1976. The makeup of Hammertown Boys, and Hammertown, is largely working-class, with some [[Immigration|immigrants]] from [[South Asia]] and the [[West Indies]]. At the time of the study, the local school system was expanding its infrastructure and exploring new pedagogical methods, thanks to the implementation of the [[Raising of school leaving age in England and Wales|Raising of School Leaving Age]] policies in September [[1972]] that were in line with [[education reform]]s that sought to keep youth in schools for a greater span of time, as well as offer them opportunities for gainful employment and [[Social mobility|socioeconomic mobility]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Willis's research was made possible by funding through the [[Social Science Research Council]]. Willis acknowledged the advice and support of members of the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] at the [[University of Birmingham]], including cultural theorist [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], in writing in the book.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Summary ==
''Learning to Labour'' is organized into two sections: ethnography and analysis. In Part One, Willis describes and analyzes the nonconformist counter-school culture produced by Hammertown Boys' [[White people|White]], working-class boys (called "lads"). In this section, he applies [[thick description]] and ethnographic analysis to the counter-school culture of the lads, recognizing the legitimacy and reality of the students' own interpretive accounts of schooling. In Part Two, Willis analyzes his own ethnography to produce a theoretical account of how counter-school culture plays a vital role in leading working-class students into subordinate, low-wage labor positions in adult life, fulfilling what he calls their "self-damnation."&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. pp. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Working-class youths' recognition of, and reaction against, the dominating, [[Discipline|disciplinary]] mechanisms of school help seal their future outcomes as workers, in turn enabling the social reproduction of [[Social class|class positions]].

=== Part One: Ethnography ===
Willis uses the [[qualitative research]] methods of participant observation and group interviews to study an informal (but socially cohesive) group of twelve lads at Hammertown Boys. He distinguishes between two distinct, informal groups of the working-class students at Hammertown Boys: lads and 'ear'oles. Whereas the lads are those nonconformist students who defy authority, 'ear'oles are those conformist students who invest themselves in formal learning and academic achievement, and therefore in the authority of teachers and the school system. The term "'ear'ole" recalls the earhole or [[earlobe]], signifying conformist students' passive reception of learning. This contrasts with lads' rowdy, active behaviour in school. The lads perceive themselves as more manly, more authentic, and more independent than the 'ear'oles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The lads informally socialise and organise themselves against the 'ear'oles and the school as an institution, producing a culture of nonconformity, rebellion, and opposition to their school's authority figures and strictures. It is not only important that the lads smoke and [[Heterosexuality|have sex with girls]], but are seen to smoke and recognized to have had sexual liaisons. Behaviours that define the forms of this culture, such as playing pranks on teachers, harassing conformist students, and refusing to inform teachers of each other's behaviour, also build a sense of solidarity and identity among their group. The lads' culture is also [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] and [[Racism|racist]], as girls and non-Whites are excluded from their informal group. It also strongly identifies with the actual, working-class environment from which it originates. In terms of working-class identity, their culture has much in common with the culture of working-class shop floors. This includes the active search for producing moments of excitement, disorder, and enjoyment in what is an otherwise boring, routine, and meaningless span of time of work for adult workers, and [[school discipline]] for students.

Over the course of their time as Hammertown Boys, the lads were recognised by school authorities as a distinct "anti-school group." However, when they were of age to legally leave school, in their fifth year in secondary school, few of them did.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. pp. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, as the lads took career-preparation lessons in school, they rejected the legitimacy of formal credentials and qualifications, prizing instead manual labour as superior to and more authentic than mental labour. This inverted the lessons' insinuation of mental labour’s being more desirable than [[manual labour]] by dint of its higher [[socioeconomic status]]. By the end of the ethnography, the lads were easily able to enter working-class jobs, including [[Plumber|plumbing]], [[Bricklayer|bricklaying]], and trainee [[Machinist|machine work]]. However, half of them left their job for another after one year of work, and one was unable to find work at all. Willis ended the ethnographic study in autumn 1976, with the lads routed into working-class labour with little hope of rising into the [[middle class]], even as they subjectively experienced manual labour and income as empowering. Willis writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;There is also a sense in which, despite the ravages -- fairly well contained at this point anyway -- manual work stands for something and is a way of contributing to and substantiating a certain view of life which criticises, scorns and devalues others as well as putting the self, as they feel it, in some elusive way ahead of the game. These feelings arise precisely from a sense of their own labour power which has been learnt and truly appropriated as insight and self-advance within the depths of the counter-school culture as it develops specific class forms in the institutional context. It is difficult to think how attitudes of such strength and informal and personal validity could have been formed in any other way. It is they, not formal schooling, which carry 'the lads' over into a certain application to the productive process. In a sense, therefore, there is an element of self-domination in the acceptance of subordinate roles in western capitalism. However, this damnation is experienced, paradoxically, as a form of true learning, appropriation and as a kind of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Part Two: Analysis ===
In the second half of ''Learning to Labour'', Willis synthesises his observations of the lads' counter-school culture at Hammertown Boys in order to produce a theory of social reproduction that integrates culture as a key element alongside education. He proposes that the working-class lads enter working-class jobs of their own apparent volition, but this is not to be understood as merely a psychological inclination toward these jobs, nor as merely the deterministic effect of capitalist [[ideology]] persuading them to select them. Rather, it is in school that the lads acquire a distorted [[class consciousness]] through their counter-school culture, in which they end up embracing working-class, manual labor as more affirming and authentic. A rebellious culture can successfully oppose the norms of capitalism transmitted in school, but the success is, in Willis's terms, a "pyrrhic victory," for they end up taking on working-class jobs as adults.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In his analysis, Willis defines and uses the following concepts: 
* '''Teaching paradigm:''' The teaching paradigm is the principal set of demands and incentives used by the school system. According to this paradigm, students consent to behave obediently and in deference to their teacher in exchange for promised credentials that will help them move upward socioeconomically. This paradigm, which helps the teacher with authority, implies the desirability of obedience, deference, and conformity for working-class students, and recalls the banking paradigm in [[Paulo Freire|Paulo Freire's]] ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of the Oppressed|last=Freire|first=Paulo|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2000|isbn=0-8264-1276-9|location=New York, NY|pages=72–75|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Willis notes the importance of teachers' winning from their students consent to the teaching paradigm, as their exchange-based authority does not permit them to directly impose it on students.
* '''Differentiation''' and '''integration''': Willis describes differentiation as the process by which working-class students reinterpret, invert, criticize, and reject the teaching paradigm as failing to meet their objective interests as members of the working class. Aspects of differentiation constitute, in part, the lads' counter-school culture. Integration is the opposite of differentiation, the process by which agents of the school system, such as teachers, attempt to legitimise the role of schooling in improving students' lives. The tug-of-war between differentiation and integration is, in Willis's observation, continually manifested through day-to-day contests between teachers attempting to maintain their authority and lads attempting to subvert it. 
* '''Penetration''' and '''limitation''': These struggles between the lads and teachers occasionally lead to penetration, which denotes the lads' insights into their own class condition, as interpreted through the lens of their counter-school culture. It is through penetrations that working-class youth recognise the illusions of the teaching paradigm, and more generally of [[liberal democracy]] and [[Capitalism|capitalism's]] promises of advancement through education. Willis notes, however, that penetrations are, for anyone immersed in their own culture, partial and disorganised, meaning that they are culturally, subjectively distorted, and unable to bloom into [[Political radicalism|politically radical]] class consciousness. Later, he describes this partiality as limitations. The limitations of penetrations grant the lads a sense of freedom, affirmation, solidarity, and empowerment in their rebellion and embrace of working-class identity. For example, that the lads understand the teaching paradigm's valuation of mental labour as superior to manual labour is a penetration; on the other hand, that they respond by culturally affirming manual labour over mental labour, as more sensual and authentic, shows the partiality of their perpetration. Willis also identifies limitations in the intersection of patriarchy and capitalism: The lads approach manual labour as a means to accomplish a [[Masculinity|masculine identity]], and identify [[gender]] [[domestic labor|domestic labour]] and mental labour as girlish and "[[Sissy|cissy]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. pp. 147-149.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''[[Ideology]]''': Drawing on the theory of [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], Willis argues that schools are also complicit in social reproduction as [[Ideological State Apparatus|state institutions for ideology]]. [[Career counseling]] programs in secondary school emphasise individual competition, promote the desirability of [[White-collar worker|white-collar labour]], and [[Reification (Marxism)|reify]] adult work as an inevitable and natural stage of life. Ideology also has the power to undo any successful penetrations, by acknowledging the facts of [[economic inequality]] and domination in the workplace by [[Supervisor|bosses]], without organising these facts in any kind of systematic framework of class, [[wage labour]], and exploitation. Ideology and penetration are at odds, and help determine the degree to which working-class youth identify with the working class. 
In ''Learning to Labour'', the informal, creative, counter-school culture of the lads is vital to understanding the reproduction of class structure. Willis notes that working-class cultures are distinct in that they have no stake in subscribing to the dominant capitalist ideology, and therefore have the potential to subvert it. Yet it is this subversion that routes the lads into working-class labour, seemingly of their own volition. They use culture to explain and interpret the structures of schooling and work that enfold them, but doing so also steers them into social reproduction.

Willis warns against an overtly deterministic mode of social reproduction, encouraging the consideration of culture in a mediating role. He also warns against policy that would focus strictly on changing culture as a means to change material outcomes in education and labour. ''Learning to Labour'' ends with several practical suggestions for changing education accordingly, including:
* Recognising the competition inherent to an educational [[meritocracy]] 
* Respecting the insights and logic of youth working-class culture 
* Communicating to students without denigrating their social identities 
* Discussing elements of students' own cultural forms, including wage labour, [[street fighting]], sexism, and rebellion 
* Recognising the limits of pedagogy and teaching paradigms in reaching disaffected working-class students, as well as the necessity of some authority in classrooms. Although Willis acknowledges the possibility of using radical pedagogical methods, he suggests they would be ineffective for students as the Hammertown Boys lads, who are likely to register a teacher's withdrawal from authority as simply their victory over him.
In his afterword to the Morningside Edition, Willis reflected that ''Learning to Labour'' contributed to the academic literature of education by advancing social reproduction theory and by asserting the complicity of both liberal educational policies and student in causing educational and socioeconomic inequality. While researchers must be skeptical of schools' purported role in improving social mobility, schools are not all-powerful in reproducing class:&lt;blockquote&gt;There may be a justified skepticism about liberal claims in education, but the "Reproduction" perspective moves too quickly to a simple version of their opposite. Apparently, education unproblematically does the bidding of the capitalist economy by inserting working class agents into unequal futures ... The actually varied, complex, and creative field of human consciousness, culture, and capacity is reduced to the dry abstraction of structural determination. Capital requires it, therefore schools do it! Humans become dummies, dupes, or zombies. Their innermost sensibilities are freely drawn on. The school is even the main site for this cosmic drawing; for all we are told of how this actually happens, schools may as well be "black boxes." This will not do theoretically. It certainly will not do politically. Pessimism reigns supreme in this, the most spectacular of secular relations of pre-determination.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Reception ==
''Learning to Labour'' was received with wide acclaim.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Aronowitz. "Foreword." ''Learning to Labor in New Times''. pp. x-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years after its original release,  Willis discussed his research with a variety of educators and community groups, who provided both support and criticism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An anthology of essays, titled ''Learning to Labour in New Times'', was published in 2004, growing from a 2002 [[American Educational Research Association]] meeting to recognise ''Learning to Labour''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s 25th anniversary. [[Jean Anyon]], Michael Apple, [[Peter McLaren]], and other academics contributed essays to the anthology, applying Willis's ethnography to contemporary issues of gender, race, [[neoliberalism]], [[Precarious work|work precarity]], [[globalization|globalisation]], media, and [[United States incarceration rate|mass incarceration in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Aronowitz. "Foreword." ''Learning to Labor in New Times''. pp. 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Black people|Black]] youth in United States schools develop cultures of oppositionality, collective identity, and "tough fronts," similar to the Hammertown lads, but are led to incarceration instead of working-class jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, Kathleen; Anyon, Jean.

In the wider field of cultural studies, ''Learning to Labour'' was recognized as an important text in [[youth studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postmodernism and Popular Culture|last=McRobbie|first=Angela|publisher=Routledge|year=1994|isbn=0-203-16833X|location=New York, NY|pages=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as working-class leisure and culture, whereas other contemporaneous leftist research in the social sciences tended to foreground employment, [[Trade union|labour unions]], and political organizations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McRobbie|first=Angela|year=1980|title=Settling Accounts with Subcultures: A Feminist Critique|journal=Screen Education|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Willis acknowledged that shortly after its first release, some right-wing policymakers and politicians sought to appropriate its findings to justify [[Tracking (education)|tracking]] and legitimate educational inequality.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. pp. 214-215.&lt;/ref&gt; While Willis repudiated this use of his work, he even more strongly criticised well-intending, liberal policies that sought to extirpate counter-school cultures: &lt;blockquote&gt;Besides, even in the worst case of interpretation and action taken on the book-the "oiling" paradigm-a cynical recognition of actual cultures is preferable to their attempted destruction as "pathological" cases, or their chimerical projection into shocking Satanic forms visited upon us from nowhere. "Solutions" based on such myths are likely to be cruel because their recipients were never seen as real people.&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs.'' p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Willis further advanced concepts of profane, working-class youth culture and symbolic labour in his 1990 book ''Common Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Common Culture|last=Willis|first=Paul|publisher=Open University Press|year=1990|isbn=0-8133-1097-0|location=Buckingham, UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, Peter; Scatamburlo-D'Annibale. "Paul Willis, Class Consciousness, and Critical Pedagogy." ''Learning to Labor in New Times''. pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
Researchers in education and [[cultural studies]], including [[Angela McRobbie]], criticized ''Learning to Labour'' for neglecting girls and conformist male students in its study. McRobbie wrote that Willis's study took little concern with the overt and violent sexism of the lads falling into a wider pattern of cultural studies' failure to prioritise gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McRobbie|first=Angela|date=2010|title=Reflections on Feminism, Immaterial Labour and the Post-Fordist Regime|journal=New Formations|volume=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism and Youth Culture: From Jackie to Just Seventeen|last=McRobbie|first=Angela|publisher=Unwin Hyman|year=1991|isbn=978-0333452646|location=Boston|pages=18|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reply, Willis acknowledged this sexism, but replied that he had indeed incorporated a construction of working-class [[masculinity]] as "self-entrapment."&lt;ref&gt;''Learning to Labour: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Willis's ethnography was also criticised for an unclear methodology, inviting questions of [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and generalization as a "fish 'n' chips ethnography.'"&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;West, Gord (1980). "Cries from the School Corridors of North York, Birmingham and Tyneside." ''This Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers also replied to ''Learning to Labour'' that cultures of resistance were absent in their own classrooms. In turn, Willis argued that such cultures are not immediately obvious, and may be interpreted as individualised behaviours. Moreover, studies of student culture require extensive fieldwork to generate [[Validity (statistics)|validity]], and quantitative methods such as surveys, which may produce greater reliability, cannot satisfactorily report on cultural forms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10409">'''Location theory''' has become an integral part of [[economic geography]], [[regional science]], and spatial economics. Location theory addresses questions of what economic activities are located where and why. Location theory or [[microeconomics|microeconomic theory]] generally assumes that agents act in their own self-interest. Firms thus choose locations that maximize their profits and individuals choose locations that maximize their utility.

==Origins==
While others should get some credit for earlier work (e.g., [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Etienne Bonnot de Condillac]], [[David Hume]], [[James Denham-Steuart|Sir James D. Steuart]], and [[David Ricardo]]), it was not until the publication of [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]]'s first volume of ''Der Isolierte Staat'' in 1826 that location theory can be said to have really gotten underway.&lt;ref&gt;Thünen, Johann Heinrich von. 1783–1850. ''Der Isolierte Staat in Beziehung auf Landwirtschaft und Nationalökonomie, oder Untersuchungen über den Einfluss, den die Getreidepreise, der Reichtum des Bodens und die Abgaben auf den Ackerbau ausüben, Vol. 1,.'' and ''Der Isolierte Staat..., Vol II: Der Naturgeässe Arbeitslohn und dessen Verhältnis zum Zinsfuss und zur Landrente, Part 1'' (Partial translation into English by Carla M. Wartenberg in 1966 as ''Isolated State.'' New York: Pergamon Press.) For more information, see [http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/9 Scott Crosier's ''Johann-Heinrich von Thünen: Balancing Land-Use Allocation with Transport Cost''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, Bernard W. 1960. ''The Frontier Wage'' Chicago: Loyola University Press. In pages 187–367 Dempsey has translated von Thünen 1863 piece ''Der Isolierte Staat, Vol II, Part 2'' as ''The Isolated State in Relation to Agriculture and Political Economy, Vol. II: The Natural Wage and Its Relation to the Rate of Interest and to Economic Rent.''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the prominent [[regional science|regional scientist]] [[Walter Isard]] has called von Thünen "the father of location theorists."&lt;ref&gt;Isard (1956, p. 27).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Der Isolierte Staat'', von Thünen notes that the costs of transporting goods consumes some of Ricardo's economic rent. He notes that because these transportation costs and, of course, economic rents, vary across goods, different land uses and use intensities will result with increased distance from the marketplace. However, the discussion was criticized since [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]] oversimplified the problem with his assumptions of, for example, isolated states or single cities.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, H. A. (1962). Transportation Costs and Plant Location: A Review of Principal Theories. ''Transportation Journal, 2''(2), 19–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tord Palander (1935) wrote: Market area division of two competing firms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PA5FalH0CeAC&amp;pg=PA676&amp;lpg=PA676&amp;dq=tord+polander&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QOdLjSbQpH&amp;sig=fpst81q6y8MWQA-dBLc8Rdzxonk&amp;hl=bs&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=saXrToP_Lqv74QTko_DoCA&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tord%20polander&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

A German hegemony of sorts seems to have taken hold in location theory from the time of von Thünen through to [[Walter Christaller]]'s 1933 book ''Die Zentralen Orte in Sűddeutschland'', which formulated much of what is now understood as [[central place theory]]. An especially notable contribution was made by [[Alfred Weber]], who published ''Über den Standort der Industrien'' in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Alfred. 1929. (translated by Carl J. Friedrich from Weber's 1909 book). ''Theory of the Location of Industries''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.  For more details see [http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/51 David Fearon's ''Alfred Weber: Theory of the Location of Industries, 1909''].&lt;/ref&gt; Working from a model akin to a physical frame adapted from some ideas by [[Pierre Varignon]] (a [[Varignon frame]]), Weber applies freight rates of resources and finished goods, along with the finished good's production function, to develop an algorithm that identifies the optimal location for manufacturing plant. He also introduces distortions induced by labor and both agglomerative and deglomerative forces. Weber then discusses groupings of production units, anticipating Lösch's market areas. 

[[Wilhelm Launhardt|Carl Wilhelm Friedrich Launhardt]] conceived much of that for which Alfred Weber received credit, prior to Weber's work. Moreover, his contributions are surprisingly more modern in their analytical content than are Weber's. This suggests that Launhardt was ahead of his time and not readily understood by many of his contemporaries. Whether Weber was familiar with Launhardt's publications remains unclear. Weber was most certainly influenced by others, most notably [[Wilhelm Roscher]] and [[Albert Schäffle]], who seem likely to have read Launhardt's work. Regardless, location theoretical thought blossomed only after Weber's book was published.

Literature on site selection theory used to look until recent years at the various issues only from a national point of view. By large, there are no international reviews to be found in these publications. In the US, a country in which industrial site selection played a role very early on, resulting in a very early search for methodical approaches, Edgar M. Hoover was one of the leading pioneers in the field of site analysis.  In his book “The Location of Economic Activity”,  Hoover compiled crucial criteria of industrial site selection as early as 1948 that still apply today. There were, however, some quite early attempts to combine theories of international trade with nationally oriented site theories in order to develop a site theory with an international perspective. One of these early authors was Ohlin (1952), followed by Sabathil (1969) , Moore (1978),   Tesch (1980),   and Goette (1994) .

Nevertheless, even to this day, this situation has only changed to some extent. Even though since the 1990s it has no longer been only major corporations that expand abroad, and any foreign direct investment results in a site selection, there are still very few well-researched studies on this topic. A specifically international site selection theory is still not discernible. Many current and more recent publications either review site decisions made by individual corporations or analyze them as reference cases. Other publications focus on a cost-specific approach largely driven by site relocations in the context of cost structure optimization within major corporations. However, these publications only rarely and at best cursorily deal with issues of construction and real estate aspects.

Theodor Sabathil’s 1969 dissertation is considered one of the early in-depth studies in the area of international site selection. Therein, Sabathil largely focused on country selection, which is part of the site selection process. In this context, Sabathil compiled a comprehensive catalogue of site factors and a theoretical approach to site selection; the latter does not go into great detail. Neither does Sabathil take any legal, natural, or cultural site factors into consideration. However, he discusses in particular company-specific framework conditions and psychological factors.&lt;ref&gt; Glatte, Thomas 2015. ''Location Strategies: Methods and their methodological limitations'' Journal for Engineering, Design and Technology, Volume 13, Issue 3, p. 435 - 462 &lt;/ref&gt;

The dissertation submitted in 1980 by Peter Tesch constitutes another milestone in the further development of international site theory. Tesch combines theories of international trade and investment with site theories. He is the first to include country-specific framework conditions in his analysis. The main basis for his comments on the various types of internationalization are location-specific competitive advantages. In this context, Tesch developed a catalogue of criteria for international site decisions grouped into three categories:
•	site factors affecting all company activities
•	availability and costs of the site factors impacting on the production factors
•	turnover-related site factors.

Thomas Goette’s 1994 study tries to classify important international site factors and to structure the process of international site selection. Goette distinguishes between economic site conditions (sales potential, competitive conditions, infrastructure and transportation costs, labor, monetary conditions), political site conditions (tax legislation, environmental protection, institutional market entry barriers, support of business, political risks), cultural site conditions (differences in language, mentality, religion, and the lack of acceptancy of foreign companies), and geographical site conditions (climate, topography). This study again demonstrates that an attempt to cover all aspects will result in loss of quality as all factors were not or could not be taken into consideration. Goette also theorizes that, in particular, industrial site decisions within companies are usually once-off and division-related decision-making processes. Based on this, Goette assumes a relatively low learning curve, and hence little potential for improvement for subsequent projects.

As one of the last major contributions, Thomas Glatte aimed to enhance and globalize the known systems in his book "International Production Site Selection" by providing a 10-staged selection process, suggesting selected methods for each selection stage and offering a comprehensive list of criteria for the practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;Glatte, Thomas 2013. ''Industrial Production Site Selection'' Expert Verlag, Renningen, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
Location theory has also been used outside of economics, for example in [[conservation biology]], where it can help to find areas that would be good to study, taking into account previous studies.&lt;ref name="Catalyst"&gt;{{cite web

In [[zoology]], '''mammalogy''' is the study of [[mammal]]s – a [[class (biology)|class]] of [[vertebrate]]s with characteristics such as [[homeotherm]]ic [[metabolism]], [[fur]], four-chambered [[heart]]s, and complex [[nervous system]]s. Mammalogy has also been known as "'''mastology'''," "'''theriology'''," and "'''therology'''." There are about 4,200 different species of mammals. The major branches of mammalogy include natural history, taxonomy and systematics, anatomy and physiology, ethology, ecology, and management and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/mammalogy|title=mammalogy {{!}} zoology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approximate salary of a mammalogist varies from $20,000 to $60,000 a year, depending on their experience.  Mammalogists are typically involved in activities such as conducting research, managing personnel, and writing proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mammalogist|url=http://www.aboutbioscience.org/careers/mammalogist|work=Bioscience Careers|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammalogy branches off into other taxonomically-oriented disciplines such as [[primatology]] (study of [[primates]]), and [[cetology]] (study of [[cetaceans]]). Like other studies, mammalogy is also  a part of zoology which is also a part of biology.

== List of mammalogy journals ==

This is a list of scientific journals broadly serving mammalogists. In addition, many other more general zoology, ecology and evolution, or conservation journals also deal with mammals, and several journals are specific to only certain taxonomic groups of mammals.

The '''Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI)''' is an independent nonprofit [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[research institute|research institution]] in [[Berkeley, California]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/for-visitors/directions|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded as a world leading mathematical center for collaborative research, drawing thousands of visiting researchers from around the world each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2004/12/06_chern.shtml|title=12.06.2004 - Renowned mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern, who revitalized the study of geometry, has died at 93 in Tianjin, China|website=www.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/our-mission|title=MSRI|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/programs/diversity/ProgramDescription_MSRI_2012v2.pdf|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bridgesmathart.org/mosaic/about-msri/|title= About MSRI|website=[[The Bridges Organization]] |access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/tag/msri/|title=MSRI |publisher=[[Simons Foundation]] |access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simonsfoundation.org/features/foundation-news/17-gauss-way/|title=17 Gauss Way |publisher=Simons Foundation|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MSRI was founded in 1982, and its funding sources include the [[National Science Foundation]], foundations, corporations, and more than 90 universities and institutions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/history|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/our-mission|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is located at 17 Gauss Way on the [[University of California, Berkeley]] campus, close to [[Grizzly Peak (Berkeley Hills)|Grizzly Peak]] (on the [[Berkeley Hills|hills]] overlooking [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History ==
The Mathematical Sciences Research Institute was founded in September 1982 by three UC Berkeley professors [[Shiing-Shen Chern]], [[Calvin C. Moore|Calvin Moore]], and [[Isadore Singer|Isadore M. Singer]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ias.edu/scholars/shiing-shen-chern|title=Shiing-Shen Chern|work=Institute for Advanced Study|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://math.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/isadore-m-singer-0|title=Isadore M. Singer |publisher=Department of Mathematics at University of California Berkeley |language=en|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shiing-Shen Chern acted as the founding Director of the institute and Calvin Moore acted as the founding Deputy Director. 

MSRI was originally located at the UC Extension Building at 2223 Fulton Street, and on April 1, 1985, MSRI moved into its current facility on Berkeley hills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Initially, MSRI paid rent for this new building to the [[University of California]]. However, since August 2000, it has occupied the building without the rental burden, as one of several contributions of the UC campus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Governance ==
MSRI is governed by a Board of Trustees consisting of up to 35 elected members and 7 ex-officio members: the Director of the Institute, the Deputy Director, the Chair of the Committee of Academic Sponsors, the co-Chairs of the Human Resources Advisory Committee and the co-Chairs of the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/governance-directory|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many mathematical institutes, MSRI has no permanent faculty or members, and its research activities are overseen by its Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC), a panel of distinguished mathematicians drawn from a variety of different areas of mathematical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/about-msri/governance-directory|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 10 regular members in the SAC, and each member serves a four-year term and is elected by the Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Research Activities==
MSRI hosts about 85 mathematicians and [[postdoctoral research fellow]]s each semester for extended stays and holds programs and workshops, which draw approximately 2,000 visits by mathematical scientists throughout the year.  The visitors come to MSRI to work in an environment that promotes creativity and the effective interchange of ideas and techniques. MSRI features two focused programs each semester, attended by foremost mathematicians and postdocs from the United States and abroad; the Institute has become a world center of activity in those fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/scientific/programs|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MSRI takes advantage of its close proximity to the [[University of California Berkeley]] and the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] and also collaborates nationally with organizations such as the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]].  The Institute’s prize-winning forty-eight thousand square foot building has views of the [[San Francisco Bay]]. After 30 years of activity, the reputation of the Institute is such that mathematicians make it a professional priority to participate in the Institute’s programs.{{fact|date=January 2018}} 

Because of its contribution to the nation’s scientific potential, MSRI’s activity is supported by the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Security Agency]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/support-msri|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private individuals, foundations, and nearly 100 Academic Sponsor Institutions, including the top mathematics departments in the United States, provide crucial support and flexibility. [[James Simons]], founder of [[Renaissance Technologies]] and a [[University of California, Berkeley]] mathematics alumnus, is a long-time supporter of MSRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/people/230|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education Programs ==
[[File:MSRI - Simons Auditorium 1.jpg|thumb|Simons Auditorium (MSRI)]]
MSRI also serves a wider community through the development of human scientific capital, providing postdoctoral training to young scientists and increasing the diversity of the research workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/education|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute also advances the education of young people with conferences on critical issues in mathematics education. Additionally, they host research workshops that are unconnected to the main programs, such as its annual workshop on [[K-12]] mathematics education ''Critical Issues in Mathematics Education.''   

During the summer, workshops for graduate students are held through the MSRI-UP program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/education/for-undergraduates/msri-up|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSRI sponsors programs for middle and high school students and their teachers as part of the [[Math_circles#Math_circles_in_North_America|Math Circles]] and Circles for Teachers that meet weekly in San Francisco, Berkeley, and Oakland.  It also sponsors the Bay Area Mathematical Olympiad (BAMO), the [[Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival]], and the U.S. team of young girls that competes at the [[China Girls Math Olympiad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msri.org/web/msri/public|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lectures given at MSRI events are videotaped and made available for free on the internet.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msri.org/web/msri/online-videos/special-productions-events|title=Mathematical Sciences Research Institute|last=MSRI|website=www.msri.org|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSRI has sponsored a number of events that reach out to the non-mathematical public, and its Simons Auditorium also hosts special performances of classical music. Mathematician [[Robert Osserman]] has held a series of public "conversations" with artists who have been influenced by mathematics in their work, such as composer [[Philip Glass]], actor and writer [[Steve Martin]], playwright [[Tom Stoppard]], and actor and author [[Alan Alda]].  MSRI also collaborates with local playwrights for an annual program of new short mathematics-inspired plays at Monday Night Playground at the [[Berkeley Repertory Theater]], and co-sponsored a series of mathematics-inspired films with UC Berkeley's [[Pacific Film Archive]] for MSRI's 20th anniversary. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It also created a series of [[mathematical puzzles]] that were posted among the advertising placards on [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|San Francisco Muni]] buses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49222">{{short description|A field of evolutionary biology that applies molecular population genetics, molecular phylogenetics, and genomics to traditional ecological questions}}
{{for|the scientific journal|Molecular Ecology}}
{{More citations needed|date=September 2014}}
'''Molecular ecology''' is a field of [[evolutionary biology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charlesworth|first1=Brian|title=Measures of Divergence Between Populations and the Effect of Forces that Reduce Variability|url=http://www.filogeografia.dna.ac/PDFs/Charlesworth_B_98_Fst.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is concerned with applying molecular [[population genetics]], [[molecular phylogenetics]], and more recently [[genomics]] to traditional [[ecology|ecological]] questions (e.g., species diagnosis, conservation and assessment of biodiversity, species-area relationships, and many questions in behavioral ecology).  It is virtually synonymous with the field of "Ecological Genetics" as pioneered by [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], [[E. B. Ford]], [[Godfrey Hewitt|Godfrey M. Hewitt]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miglani |title=Essentials of Molecular Genetics |date=2015 |publisher=Alpha Science International Limited |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These fields are united in their attempt to study genetic-based questions "out in the field" as opposed to the laboratory. Molecular ecology is related to the field of [[Conservation genetics]].

Methods frequently include using [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellites]] to determine gene flow and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] between populations. The development of molecular ecology is also closely related to the use of [[microarray|DNA microarrays]], which allows for the simultaneous analysis of the expression of thousands of different genes. [[Quantitative PCR]] may also be used to analyze [[gene expression]] as a result of changes in environmental conditions or different response by differently adapted individuals.

==Bacterial diversity==
Molecular ecological techniques have recently been used to study ''in situ'' questions of bacterial diversity.  This stems from the fact that many [[microorganisms]] are not easily obtainable as cultured [[Strain (biology)|strains]] in the laboratory, which would allow for identification and characterisation. It also stems from the development of [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR technique]], which allows for rapid amplification of genetic material.

The amplification of [[DNA]] from environmental samples using general of group-specific [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]] leads to a mix of genetic material that has to be sorted out before sequencing and identification. The classic technique to achieve this is through cloning, which involves incorporating the amplified DNA fragments into bacterial [[plasmid]]s. Techniques such as [[temperature gradient gel electrophoresis]], allow for a faster result. More recently, the advent of relatively low-cost, next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, such as [[454 life sciences|454]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] platforms, has allowed exploration of bacterial ecology in relation to continental-scale environmental gradients such as pH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lauber |first1=Christian L. |last2=Hamady |first2=Micah |last3=Knight |first3=Rob |last4=Fierer |first4=Noah |date=2009 |title=Pyrosequencing-based assessment of soil pH as a predictor of soil bacterial community structure at the continental scale |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=75 |issue=15 |pages=5111–5120 |doi=10.1128/AEM.00335-09 |pmc=2725504 |pmid=19502440}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was not feasible with traditional technology.

==Fungal diversity==

Exploration of fungal diversity ''in situ'' has also benefited from next-generation DNA sequencing technologies. The use of high-throughput sequencing techniques has been widely adopted by the fungal [[ecology]] community since the first publication of their use in the field in 2009.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Větrovský |first1=Tomáš |last2=Baldrian |first2=Petr |date=2013 |title=Analysis of soil fungal communities by amplicon pyrosequencing: current approaches to data analysis and the introduction of the pipeline SEED |journal=Biology and Fertility of Soils |volume=49 |issue=8 |pages=1027–1037 |doi=10.1007/s00374-013-0801-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to exploration of bacterial diversity, these techniques have allowed high-resolution studies of fundamental questions in fungal ecology such as [[phylogeography]],&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amend | first1 = AS | last2 = Seifert | first2 = KA | last3 = Samson | first3 = R | last4 = Bruns | first4 = TD | year = 2010 | title = Indoor fungal composition is geographically patterned and more diverse in temperate zones than in the tropics | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 107 | issue = 31| pages = 13748–13753 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1000454107 | pmid=20616017 | pmc=2922287}}&lt;/ref&gt; fungal diversity in forest soils,&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buéé | first1 = M | last2 = Reich | first2 = M | last3 = Murat | first3 = C | last4 = Morin | first4 = E | last5 = Nilsson | first5 = RH | last6 = Uroz | first6 = S | last7 = Martin | first7 = F | year = 2009 | title = 454 Pyrosequencing analyses of forest soils reveal an unexpectedly high fungal diversity | url = | journal = New Phytol | volume = 184 | issue = 2| pages = 449–456 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03003.x| pmid = 19703112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stratification of fungal communities in soil horizons,&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldrian | first1 = P | last2 = Kolarik | first2 = M | last3 = Stursova | first3 = M | last4 = Kopecky | first4 = J | last5 = Valaskova | first5 = V | last6 = Vetrovsky | first6 = T | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 2012 | title = Active and total microbial communities in forest soil are largely different and highly stratified during decomposition | url = | journal = ISME J | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 248–258 | doi=10.1038/ismej.2011.95| pmid = 21776033 | pmc = 3260513 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fungal [[Ecological succession|succession]] on decomposing plant litter.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Voříšková | first1 = J | last2 = Baldrian | first2 = P | year = 2013 | title = Fungal community on decomposing leaf litter undergoes rapid successional changes | url = | journal = ISME J | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 477–486 | doi=10.1038/ismej.2012.116| pmid = 23051693 | pmc = 3578564 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of fungal ecology research leveraging next-generation sequencing approaches involves sequencing of [[PCR]] [[amplicons]] of conserved regions of DNA (i.e. marker genes) to identify and describe the distribution of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic groups]] in the fungal community in question, though more recent research has focused on sequencing functional gene [[amplicons]]&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; (e.g. Baldrian et al. 2012&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;).

== Extra-pair fertilizations ==
In recent years, molecular data and analyses have been able to supplement traditional approaches of [[behavioral ecology]], the study of animal behavior in relation to its ecology and evolutionary history. One behavior that molecular data has helped scientists better understand is extra-pair fertilizations (EPFs), also known as [[Extra-pair copulation|extra-pair copulations (EPCs)]]. These are mating events that occur outside of a social bond, like monogamy and are hard to observe. Molecular data has been key to understanding the prevalence of and the individuals participating in EPFs.

While most bird species are socially monogamous, molecular data has revealed that less than 25% of these species are genetically monogamous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griffith|first=Simon C.|last2=Owens|first2=Ian P.

Without molecular ecology, identifying individuals that participate in EPFs and the offspring that result from EPFs would be impossible.

== Isolation by distance ==
[[Isolation by distance]] (IBD), like reproductive isolation, is the effect of physical barriers to populations that limit migration and lower gene flow.  The shorter the distance between populations the more likely individuals are to disperse and mate and thus, increase gene flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = Sewall | year = 1943 | title = Isolation by Distance | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 114–138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of molecular data, specifically allele frequencies of individuals among populations in relation to their geographic distance help to explain concepts such as, sex-biased [[Inbreeding avoidance|dispersal]], [[speciation]], and landscape genetics.

The [[Mantel test]] is an assessment that compares genetic distance with geographic distance and is most appropriate because it doesn't assume that the comparisons are independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Ecology|last=Freeland|first=Joanna|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-0-470-74833-6|location=|pages=135|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are three main factors that influence the chances of finding a correlation of IBD, which include sample size, metabolism, and taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jenkins | first1 = D. G. | last2 = Carey | first2 = M. | last3 = Czerniewska | first3 = J. | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2010 | title = A meta-analysis of isolation by distance: relic or reference standard for landscape genetics? | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06285.x | journal = Ecography | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 315–320 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, based on the meta-analysis, ectotherms are more likely than endotherms to display greater IBD.

== Metapopulation theory ==

[[Metapopulation]] theory dictates that a metapopulation consists of spatially distinct populations that interact with one another on some level and move through a cycle of extinctions and recolonizations (i.e. through dispersal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levins | first1 = R | year = 1969 | title = Some demographic and genetic consequences of environmental heterogeneity for biological control | url = | journal = Bulletin of the Entomological Society of America | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 237–240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common metapopulation model is the extinction-recolonization model which explains systems in which spatially distinct populations undergo [[stochastic]] changes in population sizes which may lead to extinction at the population level. Once this has occurred, dispersing individuals from other populations will immigrate and "rescue" the population at that site. Other metapopulation models include the source-sink model (island-mainland model) where one (or multiple) large central population(s) produces disperses to smaller satellite populations that have a population growth rate of less than one and could not persist without the influx from the main population.

Metapopulation structure and the repeated extinctions and recolonizations can significantly affect a population's genetic structure. Recolonization by a few dispersers leads to [[population bottlenecks]] which will reduce the [[effective population size]] (Ne), accelerate [[genetic drift]], and deplete genetic variation. However, dispersal between populations in the metapopulation can reverse or halt these processes over the long term. Therefore, in order for individual sub-populations to remain healthy, they must either have a large population size or have a relatively high rate of dispersal with other subpopulations. Molecular ecology focuses on using tests to determine the rates of dispersal between populations and can use [[molecular clocks]] to determine when historic bottlenecks occurred. As habitat becomes more fragmented, dispersal between populations will become increasingly rare. Therefore, subpopulations that may have historically been preserved by a metapopulation structure may start to decline. Using mitochondrial or nuclear markers to monitor dispersal coupled with population Fst values and allelic richness can provide insight into how well a population is performing and how it will perform into the future.

==Molecular clocks==
The molecular clock hypothesis states that DNA sequences roughly evolve at the same rate and because of this the dissimilarity between two sequences can be used to tell how long ago they diverged from one another. The first step in of using a molecular clock is it must be calibrated based on the approximate time the two lineages being study diverged. The sources usually used to calibrate the molecular clocks are fossils or known geological events in the past. After calibrating the clock the next step is to calculate divergence time by dividing the estimated time since the sequences diverged by the amount of sequence divergence. The resulting number is the estimated rate at which molecular evolution is occurring. The most widely cited molecular clock is a ‘universal’ mtDNA clock of approximately 2 per cent sequence divergence every million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = W. M. | last2 = Prager | first2 = E. M. | last3 = Wang | first3 = A. | last4 = Wilson | first4 = A. C. | year = 1982 | title = Mitochondrial DNA sequences of primates: tempo and mode of evolution | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 225–239 | doi=10.1007/bf01734101 | pmid=6284948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is referred to as a universal clock, this idea of "universal" clock is not really possible considering rates of evolution differ within DNA regions. Another drawback to using molecular clocks is that they ideally need to be calibrated from an independent source of data other than the molecular data. This poses a big problem for taxa that don’t fossilize or preserve well because its almost impossible to calibrate their molecular clocks. Despite these inconveniences, the molecular clock hypothesis is still used today, and has been successful in dating events happening as long ago as 65 million years such as the emergence of ancestral mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kumar | first1 = S. | last2 = Hedges | first2 = S. B. | year = 1998 | title = A molecular timescale for vertebrate evolution | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 392 | issue = | pages = 917–920 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mate choice hypotheses ==
The concept of [[mate choice]] explains how organisms select their mates based on two main methods; The Good Genes Hypothesis and Genetic Compatibility. 
The Good Genes Hypothesis, also referred to as the [[sexy son hypothesis]], suggests that the females will choose a male that produce an offspring that will have increased fitness advantages and [[genetic viability]]. Therefore, the mates that are more 'attractive" are more likely to be chosen for mating and pass on their genes to the next generation. In species which exhibit [[polyandry]] the females will search out for the most suitable males and re-mate until they have found the best sperm to fertilize their eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yasui |first1=Yukio |date=March 1997 |title=A "Good-Sperm" model can explain the evolution of costly multiple mating by females |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=149 |issue=3 |pages=573–584 |doi=10.1086/286006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Genetic compatibility is where mates are choosing their partner based on the compatibility of their genotypes. The mate which is doing the selecting must know their own genotype as well as the genotypes of potential mates in order to select the appropriate partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Puurtinen |first1=Mikael |last2=Ketola |first2=Tarmo |last3=Kotiaho |first3=Janne S. |date=April 2005 |title=Genetic compatibility and sexual selection |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=157–158 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.02.005 |pmid=16701361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic compatibility in most instances is limited to specific traits, such as the [[major histocompatibility complex]] in mammals, because of complex genetic interactions. This behavior is potentially seen in humans. A study looking at women's choice in men based on body odors concluded that the scent of the odors were influenced by the MHC and that they influence mate choice in human populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wedekind |first1=Claus |last2=Seebeck |first2=Thomas |last3=Bettens |first3=Florence |last4=Paeke |first4=Alexander J. |date=1995 |title=MHC-dependent mate preferences in humans |journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences |volume=260 |issue=1359 |pages=245–249 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1995.0087 |issn=0962-8452 |pmid=7630893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex-Biased Dispersal ==
Sex-biased dispersal, or the tendency of one sex to disperse between populations more frequently than the other, is a common behavior studied by researchers. Three major hypotheses currently exist to help explain sex-biased dispersal. The resource-competition hypothesis infers that the more philopatric sex (the sex more likely to remain at its natal grounds) benefits during reproduction simply by having familiarity with natal ground resources. A second proposal for sex-biased dispersal is the local mate competition hypothesis, which introduces the idea that individuals encounter less mate competition with relatives the farther from their natal grounds they disperse. And the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis suggests individuals disperse to decrease inbreeding.

Studying these hypotheses can be arduous since it is nearly impossible to keep track of every individual and their whereabouts within and between populations. To combat this time-consuming method, scientists have recruited several molecular ecology techniques in order to study sex-biased dispersal. One method is the comparison of differences between nuclear and mitochondrial markers among populations. Markers showing higher levels of differentiation indicate the more philopatric sex; that is, the more a sex remains at natal grounds, the more their markers will take on a unique I.D, due to lack of gene flow with respect to that marker. Researchers can also quantify male-male and female-female pair relatedness within populations to understand which sex is more likely to disperse. Pairs with values consistently lower in one sex indicate the dispersing sex. This is because there is more gene flow in the dispersing sex and their markers are less similar than individuals of the same sex in the same population, which produces a low relatedness value. FST values are also used to understand dispersing behaviors by calculating an FST value for each sex. The sex that disperses more displays a lower FST value, which measures levels of inbreeding between the subpopulation and the total population. Additionally, assignment tests can be utilized to quantify the number of individuals of a certain sex dispersing to other populations. A more mathematical approach to quantifying sex-biased dispersal on the molecular level is the use of spatial autocorrelation. This correlation analyzes the relationship between geographic distance and spatial distance. A correlation coefficient, or r value, is calculated and the plot of r against distance provides an indication of individuals more related to or less related to one another than expected.&lt;ref&gt;Freeland, Joanna; Kirk, Heather; Petersen, Stephen (2011).

A [[quantitative trait locus]] (QTL) refers to a suite of genes that controls a quantitative trait. A quantitative trait is one that is influenced by several different genes as opposed to just one or two.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Ecology|last=Freeland|first=Joanna|last2=Kirk|first2=Heather|last3=Peterson|first3=Stephen|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|year=2011|isbn=978-1-119-99308-7|location=West Sussex, UK|pages=169–172|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; QTLs are analyzed using Qst. Qst looks at the relatedness of the traits in focus. In the case of QTLs, clines are analyzed by Qst. A [[cline (biology)]] is a change in allele frequency across a geographical distance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This change in allele frequency causes a series of intermediate varying phenotypes that when associated with certain environmental conditions can indicate selection. This selection causes local adaptation, but high gene flow is still expected to be present along the cline.

For example, barn owls in Europe exhibit a cline in reference to their plumage coloration. Their feathers range in coloration from white to reddish-brown across the geological range of the southwest to the northeast.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antoniazza|first=Sylvain|last2=Burri|first2=Reto|last3=Fumagalli|first3=Luca|last4=Goudet|first4=Jérôme|last5=Roulin|first5=Alexandre|date=2010-07-01|title=Local adaptation maintains clinal variation in melanin-based coloration of European barn owls (Tyto alba)|journal=Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution|volume=64|issue=7|pages=1944–1954|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.00969.x|issn=1558-5646|pmid=20148951}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study sought to find if this phenotypic variation was due to selection by calculating the Qst values across the owl populations. Because high gene flow was still anticipated along this cline, selection was only expected to act upon the QTLs that incur locally adaptive phenotypic traits. This can be determined by comparing the Qst values to Fst ([[fixation index]]) values. If both of these values are similar and Fst is based on neutral markers then it can be assumed that the QTLs were based on neutral markers (markers not under selection or locally adapted) as well. However, in the case of the barn owls the Qst value was much higher than the Fst value. This means that high gene flow was present allowing the neutral markers to be similar, indicated by the low Fst value. But, local adaptation due to selection was present as well, in the form of varying plumage coloration since the Qst value was high, indicating differences in these non-neutral loci.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other words, this cline of plumage coloration has some sort of adaptive value to the birds.

== Fixation indices ==
[[Fixation indices]] are used when determining the level of genetic differentiation between sub-populations within a total population. F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; is the script used to represent this index when using the formula:
: &lt;math&gt; F_{ST} = \frac{ H_{T} - H_{S} } { H_{T} } &lt;/math&gt;
In this equation, H&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; represents the expected [[heterozygosity]] of the total population and H&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the expected heterozygosity of a sub-populations. Both measures of heterozygosity are measured at one loci. In the equation, heterozygosity values expected from the total population are compared to observed heterozygosity values of the sub-populations within this total population. Larger F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values imply that the level of genetic differentiation between sub-populations within a total population is more significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Freeland |first1=Joanna R. |last2=Kirk |first2=Heather |last3=Petersen |first3=Stephen D. |title=Molecular ecology |date=2011 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell (an imprint of John Wiley &amp; Sons) |location=Chicester |isbn=978-0-470-74833-6 |pages=131–135 |edition=2nd rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of differentiation is the result of a balance between [[gene flow]] amongst sub-populations (decreasing differentiation) and [[genetic drift]] within these sub-populations (increasing differentiation); however, some molecular ecologists note that it cannot be assumed that these factors are at equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woiwood |first1=Ian |last2=Reynolds |first2=D. R. |last3=Thomas |first3=C. D. |title=Insect Movement: Mechanisms and Consequences : Proceedings of the Royal Entomological Society's 20th Symposium |publisher=CABI |isbn=978-0-85199-781-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Insect_Movement.html?id=YeEq-797_2YC |language=en|year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; can also be viewed as a way of comparing the amount of inbreeding within sub-populations to the amount of inbreeding for the total population and is sometimes referred to as an inbreeding coefficient. In these cases, higher F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values typically imply higher amounts of inbreeding within the sub-populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inbreeding and Population Structure |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~dstratto/bcor102/readings/inbreeding.pdf |publisher=University of Vermont}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors such as selection pressures may also affect F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hu |first1=Xin-Sheng |last2=He |first2=Fangliang |title=Background selection and population differentiation |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |url=https://sites.ualberta.ca/~fhe/He-publications/Hu_He.JTB05.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.01.004 |pmid=15862590 |volume=235 |issue=2 |year=2005 |pages=207–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values are accompanied by several analog equations (F&lt;sub&gt;IS&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.).These additional measures are interpreted in a similar manner to F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values; however, they are adjusted to accompany other factors that F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; may not, such as accounting for multiple loci.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Introduction to Restoration Genetics: How is Genetic Diversity Distributed in Natural Populations? |url=https://www.nps.gov/plants/restore/pubs/restgene/2.htm |website=www.nps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inbreeding depression ==
[[Inbreeding depression]] is the reduced fitness and survival of offspring from closely related parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charlesworth|first1=Deborah|last2=Willis|first2=John|title=The genetics of inbreeding depression|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=November 2009|volume=10|issue=11|pages=783–796|doi=10.1038/nrg2664|url=http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v10/n11/full/nrg2664.html|accessdate=2016-12-12|pmid=19834483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inbreeding is commonly seen in small populations because of the greater chance of mating with a relative due to limited [[mate choice]]. Inbreeding, especially in small populations, is more likely to result in higher rates of [[genetic drift]], which leads to higher rates of homozygosity at all loci in the population and decreased [[heterozygosity]]. The rate of inbreeding is based on decreased heterozygosity. In other words, the rate at which heterozygosity is lost from a population due to genetic drift is equal to the rate of accumulating inbreeding in a population. In the absence of migration, inbreeding will accumulate at a rate that is inversely proportional to the size of the population.

There are two ways in which inbreeding depression can occur. The first of these is through '''dominance''', where beneficial alleles are usually dominant and harmful alleles are usually recessive. The increased homozygosity resulting from inbreeding means that harmful alleles are more likely to be expressed as homozygotes, and the deleterious effects cannot be masked by the beneficial dominant allele. 
The second method through which inbreeding depression occurs is through [[overdominance]], or heterozygote advantage. Individuals that are heterozygous at a particular locus have a higher fitness than homozygotes at that locus. Inbreeding leads to decreased heterozygosity, and therefore decreased fitness.

Deleterious alleles can be scrubbed by natural selection from inbred populations through [[genetic purging]]. As homozygosity increases, less fit individuals will be selected against and thus those harmful alleles will be lost from the population.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freeland|first1=Joanna|last2=Kirk|first2=Heather|last3=Peterson|first3=Stephen|title=Molecular Ecology|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=John Wiley &amp; Son Ltd, The Atrium, Southern Gate, Chichester, West Sussex, PO19 8SQ, UK|isbn=978-0-470-74834-3|pages=337–341|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outbreeding depression ==
Outbreeding depression is the reduced biological fitness in the offspring of distantly related parents. The decline in fitness due to outbreeding is attributed to a breakup of coadapted gene complexes or favorable epistatic relationships.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynch | first1 = Michael | year = 1991| title = The genetic interpretation of inbreeding depression and outbreeding depression | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 1991 | issue = 3| pages = 622–629 | doi=10.2307/2409915| jstor = 2409915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[inbreeding depression]], outbreeding depression places emphasis on interactions between loci rather than within them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Risks of outbreeding depression increase with increased distance between populations. If outbreeding is limited and the population is large enough selective pressure acting on each generation may be able to restore fitness. Selection acts on out bred generations using increased diversity to adapt to the environment. This may result in greater fitness among offspring than the original parental type.

== Conservation units ==
Conservation units are classifications often used in [[conservation biology]], [[conservation genetics]], and molecular ecology in order to separate and group different species or populations based on genetic variance and significance for protection.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Ecology|last=Freeland|first=Joanna|last2=Kirk|first2=Heather|last3=Petersen|first3=Stephen|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=978-0-470-74833-6|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|pages=332–333|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most common types of conservation units are:
* Management Units (MU): Management units are populations that have very low levels of [[gene flow]] and can therefore be genetically differentiated from other populations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  
* [[Evolutionarily significant unit]]s (ESU): Evolutionarily significant units are populations that show enough genetic differentiation to warrant their management as distinct units.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Conservation units are often identified using both neutral and non-neutral genetic markers, with each having its own advantages. Using neutral markers during unit identification can provide unbiased assumptions of [[genetic drift]] and time since reproductive isolation within and among species and populations, while using non-neutral markers can provide more accurate estimations of adaptive evolutionary divergence, which can help determine the potential for a conservation unit to adapt within a certain habitat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Because of conservation units, populations and species that have high or differing levels of genetic variation are can be distinguished in order to manage each individually, which can ultimately differ based on a number of factors. In one instance, [[Atlantic salmon]] located within the [[Bay of Fundy]] were given evolutionary significance based on the differences in genetic sequences found among different populations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandersteen Tymchuk|first=Wendy|last2=O’reilly|first2=Patrick|last3=Bittman|first3=Jesse|last4=Macdonald|first4=Danielle|last5=Schulte|first5=Patricia|date=2010-05-01|title=Conservation genomics of Atlantic salmon: variation in gene expression between and within regions of the Bay of Fundy|journal=Molecular Ecology|language=en|volume=19|issue=9|pages=1842–1859|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04596.x|pmid=20529070|issn=1365-294X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This detection of evolutionary significance can allow each population of salmon to receive customized conservation and protection based on their adaptive uniqueness in response to geographic location.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Phylogenies ==
Phylogenies are the evolutionary history of an organism, also known as [[Phylogeography]]. A [[Phylogenetic tree]] is a tree that shows evolutionary relationships between different species based on similarities/differences among genetic or physical traits. Phylogenies embrace aspects of both time (evolutionary relationships) and space (geographic distribution).&lt;ref name="Freeland, Joanna 2011"&gt;Freeland, Joanna, Stephen Petersen, and Heather Kirk. Molecular Ecology. 2nd ed. Chichester, West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically phylogeny trees include tips, which represent groups of descendent species, and nodes, which represent the common ancestors of those descendants. If two descendants split from the same node, they are called [[Sister groups]]. They also may include an [[outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]], a species outside of the group of interest.&lt;ref&gt;		"Reading trees: A quick review" Understanding Evolution. University of California Museum of Paleontology. 22 August 2008 &lt;http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/060101_batsars&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The trees depict [[clades]], which is a group of organisms that include an ancestor and all descendants of that ancestor. The [[maximum parsimony]] tree is the simplest tree that has the minimum number of steps possible.

Phylogenies confer important historical processes that shape current distributions of genes and species.&lt;ref name="Freeland, Joanna 2011"/&gt; When two species become isolated from each other they retain some of the same ancestral alleles also known as allele sharing. Alleles can be shared because of lineage sorting and hybridization. Lineage sorting is driven by genetic drift  and must occur before alleles become species specific. Some of these alleles over time will simply be lost, or they may proliferate. Hybridization leads to [[introgression]] of alleles from one species to another.

== Species concepts ==
Species concepts are the subject of debate in the field of molecular ecology. Since the beginning of taxonomy, scientists have wanted to standardize and perfect the way species are defined. There are many species concepts that dictate how ecologists determine a good species. The most commonly used concept is the [[biological species concept]] which defines a species as groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups (Mayr, 1942).&lt;ref name="Freeland, Joanna 2011" /&gt; This concept is not always useful, particularly when it comes to hybrids. Other species concepts include phylogenetic species concept which describes a species as the smallest identifiable monophyletic group of organisms within which there is a parental pattern of ancestry and descent.&lt;ref name="Freeland, Joanna 2011" /&gt; This concept defines species on the identifiable. It would also suggest that until two identifiable groups actually produce offspring, they remain separate species. In 1999, John Avise and Glenn Johns suggested a standardized method for defining species based on past speciation and measuring biological classifications as time dependent. Their method used temporal banding to make genus, family and order based on how many tens of millions of years ago the speciation event that resulted in each species took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Avise |first=John |last2=Johns |first2=Glenn |year=1999 |title=Proposal for a standardized temporal scheme of biological classification for extant species |journal=Evolution |volume=96 |issue=13 |pages=7358–7363 |pmc=22090 |pmid=10377419 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.13.7358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landscape Genetics ==
Landscape genetics is a rapidly emerging interdisciplinary field within molecular ecology. Landscape genetics relates genetics to landscape characteristics, such as land-cover use (forests, agriculture, roads, etc.), presence of barriers and corridors, rivers, elevation, etc. Landscape genetics is used to answer how landscape affects dispersal and gene flow.

Barriers are any landscape features that prevents dispersal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Barriers for terrestrial species can include mountains, rivers, roads, and unsuitable terrain, such as agriculture fields. Barriers for aquatic species can include islands or dams. Barriers are species specific; for example a river is a barrier to a field mouse, while a hawk can fly over a river. Corridors are areas over which dispersal is possible.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Corridors are stretches of suitable habitat and can also be man-made, such as overpasses over roads and fish ladders on dams.

Geographic data used for landscape genetics can include data collected by radars in planes, land satellite data, marine data collected by NOAA, as well as any other ecological data. In landscape genetics researchers often use different analyses to attempt to determine the best way for a species to travel from point A to point B. Least cost path analysis uses geographic data to determine the most efficient path from one point to another.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Circuit scape analysis predicts all the possible paths and the probability of each path's use between point A and point B. These analyses are used to determine the route a dispersing individual is likely to travel.

Landscape genetics is becoming an increasingly important tool in wildlife conservation efforts. It is being used to determine how habitat loss and fragmentation affects the movement of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holderegger|first=Rolf|last2=Wagner|first2=Helene H.|date=2008-03-01|title=Landscape Genetics|url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/3/199|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=58|issue=3|pages=199–207|doi=10.1641/B580306|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to determine which species need to be managed and whether to manage subpopulations the same or differently according to their gene flow.

'''Music acquisition''' is a theory or a term that has not yet been clearly or concisely defined, although there has been research done and attempts to prove that acquiring music, like language, is cognitively possible over time. Furthermore, the process of actually and gradually acquiring music has been carefully looked at yet not with enough information or cases to form a concrete definition or states with confidence that music acquisition is impossible or definitely possible. This theory itself is influenced by the concept and studies done on [[Language acquisition]] which is defined as the processes in which people acquire over time the cognitive ability to perceive and comprehend any language, but also, use and produce language as one form of expression. Some research conveys that the definition or attributes used for expression through language can also be used for expression through music or musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adrono|first1=T.

[[File:Château de Versailles, salon des nobles, Pygmalion priant Vénus d'animer sa statue, Jean-Baptiste Regnault.jpg|thumb|''[[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]]'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Regnault]], 1786, [[Musée national du château et des Trianons]]]]

'''Object sexuality''' or '''objectophilia''' is a form of [[sexuality]] focused on particular inanimate objects. Individuals with this preference may have strong feelings of attraction, love, and commitment to certain items or structures of their fixation.  For some, sexual or even close emotional relationships with humans are incomprehensible. Some object-sexual individuals also often believe in [[animism]], and sense reciprocation based on the belief that objects have souls, intelligence, and feelings, and are able to communicate.

== Research ==
In 2009 Amy Marsh, a clinical sexologist, surveyed the twenty-one English-speaking members of [[Erika Eiffel]]'s 40-strong OS Internationale about their experiences.&lt;ref name=ehjs&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ejhs.org/volume13/ObjSexuals.htm|title=Love Among the Objectum Sexuals|journal=Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality |volume=13|date=2010-03-01|first=Amy|last=Marsh}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half reported [[autism spectrum]] disorders: six had been diagnosed, four were affected but not diagnosed, and three of the remaining nine reported having "some traits."&lt;ref&gt;''N.B.'' There are only 20 responses, though the author claims 21 respondents.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marsh, "The emotions and experiences reported by OS people correspond to general definitions of sexual orientation," such as that in an [[American Psychological Association|APA]] article "on sexual orientation and homosexuality ... [which] refers to sexual orientation as involving 'feelings and self concept.'"

== OS awareness and advocacy==
In 2009, [[Erika Eiffel]] appeared on ''[[Good Morning America]]''&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; and the ''[[Tyra Banks Show]]''{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} with Amy Marsh to discuss her marriage to the [[Eiffel Tower]] and how her object love helped her become a world champion archer. Marsh shared the results of her survey and her belief that OS could be a genuine sexual orientation, and reasoned that if childhood trauma were a factor, that there would be more OS individuals. Eiffel, who  had adopted her [[surname]] after a 2007 "marriage" to the Eiffel Tower,&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|first1=Kate|last1=Snow|first2=Janann|last2=Brady|date=2009-04-08|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=7283494&amp;page=1|title=Woman Proves Love for Eiffel Tower With Commitment Ceremony}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded '''OS Internationale''', an educational website and international online community for those identifying or researching the condition to love objects.

Amanda Liberty told the [[Daily Mail]] in March 2012 that the [[Statue of Liberty]] "is my long-distance lover and I am blown away by how stunning she is. Other people might be shocked to think I can have romantic feelings for an object, but I am not the same as them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2110198/Im-head-heels-love-Statue-Liberty-Shop-assistant-got-new-flame.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=David | last=Baker | title='I'm head over heels in love with the Statue of Liberty': Shop assistant has got a new flame! | date=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later Reighner Deleighnie declared her love for a short marble statue of [[Adonis]] that she'd named "Hans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2119164/Carer-40-spends-day-400-Adonis-moulding-dubbed-Hans.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=I'm in love with a three-foot statue of Adonis: Carer, 40, spends every day with £400 moulding of the Greek god of desire she has dubbed 'Hans' | date=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==
Marsh sees OS-like behavior in classic literature.&lt;ref name=ehjs/&gt; In Victor Hugo’s ''The Hunchback of Notre Dame'',

{{quote|[Quasimodo] loved [the bells], caressed them, talked to them, understood them. From the carillon in the steeple of the transept to the great bell over the doorway, they all shared his love.

Claude Frollo had made him the bell ringer of Notre-Dame, and to give the great bell in marriage to Quasimodo was to give Juliet to Romeo.}}

[[File:Oib outside.jpg|thumb|Orient-Institut Beirut]]

The '''Orient-Institut Beirut''' (OIB) ({{lang-ar|المعهد الألماني للأبحاث الشرقية}}) is one of ten German Humanities Institutes Abroad which belong to the [[Max Weber Foundation]]. The OIB was established in 1961 by the [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft]] (German Oriental Society) and is part of the Max Weber Foundation since 2003. The OIB supports and promotes independent research on the historical and contemporary Middle East and the Arab world in cooperation with researchers and academic institutions throughout the region.

== History ==
The Orient-Institut Beirut was founded by the German Oriental Society in 1961. It was financed by the German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology, the [[Fritz Thyssen Foundation]] and the [[VolkswagenStiftung]]. Since 2003 the Orient-Institut Beirut belongs to the Max Weber Foundation – German Humanities Institutes Abroad. In 2009 the [[Orient-Institut Istanbul]] (OI Istanbul) – which had been a branch of the Beirut institute for 20 years – became an independent institution inside the Max Weber Foundation. The OIB, which conducts and supports research on historical and contemporary issues related to Lebanon and the Arab world, has increased his cooperation with academic partners in Egypt since 2010.

== Academic Profile and Tasks ==
The OIB is an interdisciplinary research institute. The study of social, religious, and intellectual history, as well as the study of literature, language and politics figures among the various projects undertaken at the institute. It is part of the OIB's mission to support young academic researchers. The Orient-Institut Beirut employs research associates and supports PhD students, post-docs, research projects, affiliated researchers, and scholars working on the Middle East. The OIB cooperates with numerous academic institutions and organizes academic events (lectures, symposia, and congresses)on a wide variety of issues related to the [[MENA]] region.

== Library ==
The library of the OIB is open for public use and offers 130.000 volumes and 1.700 periodicals. Its collection includes studies on religion, philosophy, and law as well as on literature, history and contemporary themes related to the Middle East. Material is gathered in Western languages, in Arabic and occasionally in Persian and Turkish. All this is supplemented by academic literature from various related disciplines, including political science, social anthropology and sociology. One of the richest resources of the OIB is its collections of periodicals covering politics, religion, and culture as well as several literary magazines published in the Middle East.

== Publication series ==
The OIB publishes two series of publications and one online-publication.
* In the series '''Bibliotheca Islamica''' ({{lang-ar|النشرات الإسلامية}}) manuscripts dating back from the 11th century onwards are edited as books.&lt;ref&gt;[//www.orient-institut.org/Library/Files/Uploaded%20Files/BI%20Liste%20dt.22.9.11_aktuell.pdf ''Bibliotheca Islamica'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[//www.orient-institut.org/Library/Files/Uploaded%20Files/BI%20Liste%20ar.7.9.11_aktuell.pdf ''النشرات الإسلامية''] {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critical editions include Arabic, Persian and Turkish texts - on topics ranging from history, prosopography, literature and theology to Sufism. 
* In the series '''Beiruter Texte und Studien''' (Beirut Texts and Studies) &lt;ref&gt;[//www.orient-institut.org/Library/Files/Uploaded%20Files/BTS-Liste%20Feb_2012.pdf ''Beiruter Texte und Studien'']&lt;/ref&gt; academic studies, monographs, and conference proceedings are published in German, English, Arabic and French.
* In cooperation with the Orient-Institut Istanbul, the OIB publishes the online series '''Orient-Institut Studies''' on perspectivia.net.&lt;ref&gt;[//www.perspectivia.net/content/publikationen/orient-institut-studies/1-2012/ ''Orient-Institut Studies'']&lt;/ref&gt; This series is meant to combine regional and trans-regional perspectives in Middle Eastern and Euro-Asian Studies.

{{Paleontology}}
'''Paleotempestology''' is the study of past [[tropical cyclone]] activity by means of geological proxies as well as historical documentary records. The term was coined by [[Kerry Emanuel]].

==Methods==

===Sedimentary proxy records===
Examples of proxies include [[overwash]] deposits preserved in the [[sediment]]s of coastal lakes and [[marsh]]es, [[Micropaleontology|microfossil]]s such as [[foraminifera]], [[pollen]], [[diatom]]s, [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[phytolith]]s contained in coastal sediments, wave-generated or flood-generated sedimentary structures or deposits (called [[tempestite]]s) in marine or [[lagoon]]al sediments, storm wave deposited [[coral]] shingle, shell, sand and shell and pure sand shore parallel ridges.

The method of using overwash deposits preserved in coastal lake and marsh sediments is adopted from earlier studies of paleotsunami deposits. Both [[storm]]s and [[tsunami]]s leave very similar if not identical sedimentary deposits in coastal lakes and marshes and differentiating between the two in a sedimentary record can be difficult. The first studies to examine prehistoric records of tropical cyclones occurred in Australia and the South Pacific during the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Baines1976"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; These studies examined multiple shore parallel ridges of coral shingle or sand and marine shells. As many as 50 ridges can be deposited at a site with each representing a past severe [[tropical cyclone]] over the previous 6,000 years. Tsunamis are not known to deposit multiple sedimentary ridges and therefore these features can be more easily attributed to a past storm at any given site.

===Markers in coral===
Rocks contain certain [[isotope]]s of [[chemical element|element]]s, known as natural tracers, which describe the conditions under which they formed.  By studying the [[calcium carbonate]] in coral rock, past sea surface temperature and hurricane information can be revealed.  Heavier [[oxygen]] isotopes ([[Oxygen-18|&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]]) decrease in relation to lighter oxygen isotopes ([[Oxygen-16|&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O]]) in coral during periods of very heavy [[rain]]fall.&lt;ref&gt;Nobu Shimizu. [http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=2437 If Rocks Could Talk...] Retrieved on 2006-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since hurricanes are the main source of extreme rainfall in the tropical oceans{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}, past hurricane events can be dated to the days of their impact on the coral by looking at the decreased &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O concentration within the coral.&lt;ref&gt;Anne L. Cohen and Graham D. Layne. [http://web.mit.edu/mit-whoi/www/research/mgg/coral_hurricane_signature.html Seeking a hurricane signature in coral skeleton.] Retrieved on 2006-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speleothems and tree rings===
Isotope studies in [[speleothem]]s and tree rings ([[dendrochronology]]) offers a means by which higher resolution records of long-term tropical cyclone histories can be attained.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Dana L. |year=2006 |title=Tree-ring isotope records of tropical cyclone activity |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |volume=103 |issue=39 |pages=14294&amp;ndash;14297 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0606549103 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=16984996 |pmc=1570183 |bibcode = 2006PNAS..10314294M |display-authors=etal}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the isotope records, the sedimentary records are too coarse in their resolution to register quasi-cyclic activity at decadal to centennial scales. These higher resolution records therefore offer a means for possibly differentiating between the natural variability of tropical cyclone behaviour and the effects of anthropogenically induced global [[climate change]].  Recent studies with [[stalagmite]]s in [[Belize]] shows that events can be determined on a week-by-week basis.&lt;ref name="Frappier2007"&gt;

Before the invention of the [[telegraphy|telegraph]] in the early to mid-19th century, news was as fast as the fastest horse or stagecoach or ship.  Normally, there was no advance warning of a tropical cyclone impact.  However, the situation changed in the 19th century as seafaring people and land-based researchers, such as Father Viñes in [[Cuba]], came up with systematic methods of reading the sky's appearance or the sea state, which could foretell a tropical cyclone's approach up to a couple days in advance.

One of the best documented storms is the [[Royal Charter Storm]] of 1859 which caused over 800 deaths in the UK alone. It led directly to the formation of the [[Meteorological Office]] under [[Robert Fitzroy]]. However, wind speed could not be measured accurately at the time, methods only becoming available after the [[Tay Bridge disaster]] of 1879.
One of the better sources for storms in and around [[Great Britain|Britain]] is the [[shipwreck]] statistics compiled annually by the [[Board of Trade]], but which have yet to be analysed in detail.

Michael Chenoweth used 18th century journals to reconstruct the climate of [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name="Chenoweth2003"&gt;

'''Peer Polity Interaction''' is a concept in [[archaeological theory]] developed by [[Colin Renfrew]] and [[John F. Cherry|John Cherry]], to explain change in society and [[material culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin Renfrew: ''Introduction: Peer Polity Interaction and Socio-Political Change.'' In: Colin Renfrew, John F. Cherry (Hrsg.) ''Peer Polity Interaction and Socio-Political Change''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1986, {{ISBN|0-521-11222-2}}, S. 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer-Polity Interaction models see the primary driver of change as the relationships and contacts between societies of relatively equal standing. According to the model set out by Renfrew,&lt;ref&gt;Colin Renfrew: ''Introduction: Peer Polity Interaction and Socio-Political Change.'' In: Colin Renfrew, John F. Cherry (Hrsg.) ''Peer Polity Interaction and Socio-Political Change''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1986, {{ISBN|0-521-11222-2}}, S. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; it encompasses three main sorts of interaction:

# Competition, including [[warfare]] and [[competitive consumption|competitive emulation]]
# 'Symbolic entrainment', where societies borrow symbolic systems wholesale from their neighbours, such as numerical systems, social structures and religious beliefs, because these fill a currently empty niche in their society.
# 'Transmission of innovation', where technology spreads by trade, gift-giving, and other forms of exchange.

'''Plumbosolvency''' is the ability of a [[solvent]], notably [[water]], to dissolve [[lead]]. In the public supply of water this is an undesirable property. In (usually older) consumers' premises plumbosolvent water can attack [[lead]] pipes and any lead in [[Solder#Lead_solder|solder]] used to join copper. 
Plumbosolvency of water can be countered by achieving a pH of 7.5 by increasing the [[pH]] with [[calcium hydroxide|lime]] or [[sodium hydroxide]] (lye), or by providing a protective coating to the inside of lead pipes by the addition of [[phosphate]] at the [[water treatment]] works.

While optimal pH for prevention of plumbosolvency is 7.5, performance remains very good in the range pH 7.2-7.6.
Achieving this pH has been shown to decrease population blood lead concentrations.(3, 4)

[[Water chlorination|Chlorinating]] water also reduces dissolved lead. It causes the interiors of lead pipes to become coated with [[Lead(II) chloride|lead chloride]], which is very insoluble in cold water. However, lead chloride is fairly soluble in hot water. For this reason, water that is to be used for drinking or the preparation of food should never be taken from a hot-water tap, if the water may have been in contact with lead. Water should be taken from a cold-water tap, and heated in a pan or kettle that does not contain lead or lead solder.

'''Public health''' is "the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting human [[health]] through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Charles-Edward Amory Winslow|Winslow, Charles-Edward Amory]]|title=The Untilled Field of Public Health |journal=Modern Medicine |date=1920 |volume=2 |pages=183–191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Analyzing the health of a population and the threats is the basis for public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdcfoundation.org/content/what-public-health|title=What is Public Health|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control Foundation|publisher=Atlanta, GA: Centers for Disease Control|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "public" in question can be as small as a handful of people, an entire village or it can be as large as several continents, in the case of a [[pandemic]]. "Health" takes into account physical, mental and social well-being. It is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, according to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/suggestions/faq/en/ Frequently asked questions]
from the "Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization" as adopted by the [[International Health Conference]], 1946&lt;/ref&gt; Public health is [[interdisciplinary]]. For example, [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]] and [[health services]] are all relevant. [[Environmental health]], [[community health]], [[behavioral health]], [[health economics]], [[public policy]], [[mental health]] and [[occupational safety and health|occupational safety]], gender issues in health, sexual and reproductive health are other important subfields.

Public health aims to improve the quality of life through prevention and treatment of [[disease]], including mental health. This is done through the [[Disease surveillance|surveillance]] of cases and [[health indicators]], and through the promotion of healthy behaviors. Common public health initiatives include promoting [[hand washing|handwashing]] and [[breastfeeding]], delivery of [[vaccination]]s, [[suicide prevention]] and distribution of [[condom]]s to control the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.

Modern public health practice requires [[multidisciplinarity|multidisciplinary teams]] of public health workers and professionals. Teams might include [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]], [[biostatistics|biostatisticians]], [[medical assistant]]s, [[public health nursing|public health nurses]], [[midwives]], [[microbiologist|medical microbiologists, economists, sociologists, geneticists and data managers.]]  Depending on the need [[environmental health officer]]s or [[public health inspector]]s, [[Bioethics|bioethicists]], and even [[veterinarian]]s, gender experts, sexual and reproductive health specialists might be called on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Joint Task Group on Public Health Human Resources |author2=Advisory Committee on Health Delivery &amp; Human Resources |author3=Advisory Committee on Population Health &amp; Health Security |publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada |title=Building the public health workforce for the 21st century |location=Ottawa |year=2005 |oclc=144167975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to [[health care]] and public health initiatives are difficult challenges in [[developing nations|developing countries]]. Public health infrastructures are still forming in those countries.

==Background==
The focus of a [[public health intervention]] is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the [[health promotion|promotion of healthy behaviors]], [[healthy community design|communities]] and [[environmental protection|environments]]. Many diseases are preventable through simple, nonmedical methods. For example, research has shown that the simple act of [[hand washing|handwashing]] with soap can prevent the spread of many contagious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap. [http://www.globalhandwashing.org/handwashing-resources ''Handwashing research''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216125536/http://globalhandwashing.org/handwashing-resources |date=16 December 2010 }}, accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, treating a disease or controlling a [[pathogen]] can be vital to preventing its spread to others, either during an outbreak of [[infectious disease]] or through [[food contamination|contamination of food]] or [[water contamination|water]] supplies. [[Behavior change (public health)|Public health communications programs]], [[vaccination]] programs and distribution of [[condom]]s are examples of common preventive public health measures. Measures such as these have contributed greatly to the health of populations and increases in life expectancy.

Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in both the developing world and in developed countries through local health systems and [[non-governmental organization]]s. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is the international agency that coordinates and acts on [[global health|global public health]] issues. Most countries have their own government public health agencies, sometimes known as ministries of health, to respond to domestic health issues. For example, in the [[United States]], the front line of public health initiatives are state and local [[health department]]s. The [[United States Public Health Service]] (PHS), led by the [[Surgeon General of the United States]], and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], headquartered in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], are involved with several international health activities, in addition to their national duties. In Canada, the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] is the national agency responsible for public health, emergency preparedness and response, and infectious and [[chronic disease]] control and prevention. The [[Public health system in India]] is managed by the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare of the government of India with state-owned health care facilities.

Most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of aging and other physical and mental health conditions. However, public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. "Public health principles and neurological disorders. In: ''Neurological Disorders: Public Health Challenges.'' Geneva; 2006 - http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/neurodiso/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Public health programs providing [[vaccination]]s have made strides in promoting health, including the eradication of [[smallpox]], a disease that plagued humanity for thousands of years.
[[File:Directors of Global Smallpox Eradication Program.jpg|thumb|Three former directors of the [[Smallpox#Eradication|Global Smallpox Eradication Programme]] read the news that smallpox had been globally eradicated, 1980]]

The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies core functions of public [[health]] programs including:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/about/role/en/ ''The role of WHO in public health''], accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* providing leadership on matters critical to health and engaging in partnerships where joint action is needed;
* shaping a [[research]] agenda and stimulating the generation, translation and [[dissemination]] of valuable knowledge;
* setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation;
* articulating ethical and [[evidence-based policy]] options;
* monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.

In particular, public health surveillance programs can:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/topics/public_health_surveillance/en/ ''Public health surveillance''], accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* serve as an [[early warning system]] for impending public health emergencies;
* document the impact of an intervention, or track progress towards specified goals; and
* monitor and clarify the epidemiology of health problems, allow priorities to be set, and inform [[public health policy|health policy]] and strategies.
* diagnose, investigate, and monitor health problems and health hazards of the community

Public health surveillance has led to the identification and prioritization of many public health issues facing the world today, including [[HIV/AIDS]], [[diabetes]], [[waterborne diseases]], [[zoonosis|zoonotic diseases]], and [[antibiotic resistance]] leading to the reemergence of infectious diseases such as [[tuberculosis]]. Antibiotic resistance, also known as drug resistance, was the theme of [[World Health Day|World Health Day 2011]]. Although the prioritization of pressing public health issues is important, Laurie Garrett argues that there are following consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Garrett Laurie | year = 2007 | title = The Challenge of Global Health | url = | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 86 | issue = 1| pages = 14–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When foreign aid is funnelled into disease-specific programs, the importance of public health in general is disregarded. This public health problem of [[stovepiping]] is thought to create a lack of funds to combat other existing diseases in a given country.

For example, the WHO reports that at least 220 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is projected that the number of diabetes deaths will double by the year 2030.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/ ''Diabetes Fact Sheet N°312'', January 2011]. Accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 2010 editorial in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', the authors opined that "The fact that [[type 2 diabetes]], a largely preventable disorder, has reached epidemic proportion is a public health humiliation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | title = Type 2 diabetes—time to change our approach | journal = The Lancet | volume = 375 | issue = 9733 | pages = 2193 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20609952 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61011-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of type 2 diabetes is closely linked with the growing problem of [[obesity]]. The WHO’s latest estimates as of June 2016 highlighted that globally approximately 1.9 billion adults were overweight in 2014, and 41 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/ ''Obesity and overweight Fact sheet N°311'', Updated June 2016.] Accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is the leading country with 30.6% of its population being obese. Mexico follows behind with 24.2% and the United Kingdom with 23%. Once considered a problem in high-income countries, it is now on the rise in low-income countries, especially in urban settings. Many public health programs are increasingly dedicating attention and resources to the issue of obesity, with objectives to address the underlying causes including [[healthy diet]] and [[physical exercise]].

Some programs and policies associated with public health promotion and prevention can be controversial. One such example is programs focusing on the prevention of [[HIV]] transmission through [[safe sex]] campaigns and [[needle-exchange programme]]s. Another is the control of [[tobacco smoking]]. Changing smoking behavior requires long-term strategies, unlike the fight against [[communicable diseases]], which usually takes a shorter period for effects to be observed. Many nations have implemented [[tobacco smoking#Public policy|major initiatives]] to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places. Proponents{{Who|date=May 2014}} argue by presenting evidence that smoking is one of the major killers, and that therefore governments have a duty to reduce the death rate, both through limiting [[Passive smoking|passive (second-hand) smoking]] and by providing fewer opportunities for people to smoke. Opponents{{Who|date=May 2014}} say that this undermines individual freedom and personal responsibility, and worry that the state may be emboldened to remove more and more choice in the name of better population health overall.

Simultaneously, while communicable diseases have historically ranged uppermost as a [[global health]] priority, [[non-communicable disease]]s and the underlying behavior-related risk factors have been at the bottom. This is changing, however, as illustrated by the [[United Nations]] hosting its first General Assembly Special Summit on the issue of non-communicable diseases in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. [https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs//2010/100513_Diseases.doc.htm ''Press Conference on General Assembly Decision to Convene Summit in September 2011 on Non-Communicable Diseases''.] New York, 13 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many health problems are due to maladaptive personal behaviors. From an [[evolutionary psychology]] perspective, over consumption of novel substances that are harmful is due to the activation of an evolved [[reward system]] for substances such as drugs, tobacco, alcohol, refined salt, fat, and carbohydrates. New technologies such as modern transportation also cause reduced physical activity. Research has found that behavior is more effectively changed by taking evolutionary motivations into consideration instead of only presenting information about health effects. The marketing industry has long known the importance of associating products with high status and attractiveness to others. Films are increasingly being recognized as a public health tool&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Uy Hoang, Stella B, May CI van S|title=What’s in the ‘Public Health Toolbox’|journal=JOJ Pub Health|year=2018|volume=3|issue=2|page=555607|url=https://juniperpublishers.com/jojph/pdf/JOJPH.MS.ID.555607.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, [[Public Health Film Festival|film festivals]] and [[International Public Health Film Competition|competitions]] have been established to specifically promote films about health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1757913915619120|pmid=26702114|title=Reflections on the United Kingdom's first public health film festival|journal=Perspectives in Public Health|volume=136|issue=1|pages=23–24|year=2016|last1=Botchway|first1=Stella|last2=Hoang|first2=Uy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, it has been argued that emphasizing the harmful and undesirable effects of tobacco smoking on other persons and imposing smoking bans in public places have been particularly effective in reducing tobacco smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Curtis and Robert Aunger.

===Applications in health care===
As well as seeking to improve population health through the implementation of specific population-level interventions, public health contributes to medical care by identifying and assessing population needs for [[health care]] services, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gillam Stephen|author2=Yates, Jan|author3=Badrinath, Padmanabhan |title=Essential Public Health : theory and practice |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |oclc=144228591}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Pencheon, David |author1=Pencheon, David |author2=Guest, Charles |author3=Melzer, David |author4=Gray, JA Muir |title=Oxford Handbook of Public Health Practice |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |oclc=663666786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Smith, Sarah |author2=Sinclair, Don |author3=Raine, Rosalind |author4=Reeves, Barnarby |title=Health Care Evaluation |series=Understanding Public Health |publisher=Open University Press |year=2005|oclc=228171855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sanderson, Colin J. |author2=Gruen, Reinhold |title=Analytical Models for Decision Making |series=Understanding Public Health |publisher=Open University Press |year=2006 |oclc=182531015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assessing current services and evaluating whether they are meeting the objectives of the [[health care system]]
* Ascertaining requirements as expressed by [[health care provider|health professionals]], the public and other stakeholders
* Identifying the most appropriate interventions
* Considering the effect on resources for proposed interventions and assessing their cost-effectiveness
* Supporting decision making in health care and planning health services including any necessary changes.
* Informing, educating, and empowering people about health issues

===Implementing effective improvement strategies===
To improve public health, one important strategy is to promote modern medicine and scientific neutrality to drive the public health policy and campaign, which is recommended by Armanda Solorzana, through a case study of the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s.  Soloranza argues that public health policy can't concern only politics or economics.  Political concerns can lead government officials to hide the real numbers of people affected by disease in their regions, such as upcoming elections. Therefore, scientific neutrality in making public health policy is critical; it can ensure treatment needs are met regardless of political and economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Birn | first1 = A. E. | last2 = Solórzano | first2 = A. | title = Public health policy paradoxes: Science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 9 | pages = 1197–1213 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10501641| pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00160-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of public health care clearly shows the global effort to improve health care for all.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} However, in modern-day medicine, real, measurable change has not been clearly seen, and critics argue that this lack of improvement is due to ineffective methods that are being implemented. As argued by Paul E. Farmer, structural interventions could possibly have a large impact, and yet there are numerous problems as to why this strategy has yet to be incorporated into the health system. One of the main reasons that he suggests could be the fact that physicians are not properly trained to carry out structural interventions, meaning that the ground level health care professionals cannot implement these improvements. While structural interventions can not be the only area for improvement, the lack of coordination between socioeconomic factors and health care for the poor could be counterproductive, and end up causing greater inequity between the health care services received by the rich and by the poor. Unless health care is no longer treated as a commodity, global public health will ultimately not be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} This being the case, without changing the way in which health care is delivered to those who have less access to it, the universal goal of public health care cannot be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farmer | first1 = P. E. | last2 = Nizeye | first2 = B. | last3 = Stulac | first3 = S. | last4 = Keshavjee | first4 = S. | title = Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = e449 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17076568 | pmc = 1621099 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason why measurable changes may not be noticed in public health is because agencies themselves may not be measuring their programs' efficacy. Perrault et al.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrault|first=Evan K.|last2=Inderstrodt-Stephens|first2=Jill|last3=Hintz|first3=Elizabeth A.|date=7 December 2017|title=Tracking Success: Outputs Versus Outcomes—A Comparison of Accredited and Non-Accredited Public Health Agencies' Community Health Improvement Plan objectives|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=43|issue=3|language=en|pages=1–8|doi=10.1007/s10900-017-0454-0|pmid=29218542|issn=0094-5145}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed over 4,000 published objectives from Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs) of 280 local accredited and non-accredited public health agencies in the U.S., and found that the majority of objectives - around two-thirds - were focused on achieving agency outputs (e.g., developing communication plans, installing sidewalks, disseminating data to the community).  Only about one-third focused on seeking measurable changes in the populations they serve (i.e., changing people's knowledge, attitudes, behaviors). What this research showcases is that if agencies are only focused on accomplishing tasks (i.e., outputs) and do not have a focus on measuring actual changes in their populations with the activities they perform, it should not be surprising when measurable changes are not reported. Perrault et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; advocate for public health agencies to work with those in the discipline of [[Health communication|Health Communication]] to craft objectives that are measurable outcomes, and to assist agencies in developing tools and methods to be able to track more proximal changes in their target populations (e.g., knowledge and attitude shifts) that may be influenced by the activities the agencies are performing.

=== Public Health 2.0 ===
''Public Health 2.0'' is a movement within public health that aims to make the field more accessible to the general public and more user-driven. The term is used in three senses.  In the first sense, "Public Health 2.0" is similar to "[[Health 2.0]]" and describes the ways in which traditional public health practitioners and institutions are reaching out (or could reach out) to the public through social media and [[health blog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Wilson, Kumanan |author2=Keelan, Jennifer  |date=May 2009 | title = Coping with public health 2.0 | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 180 | issue = 10 | pages = 1080 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.090696 | pmid = 19433834 | pmc = 2679846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Vance, K. |author2=Howe, W. |author3=Dellavalle, R.P. |date=April 2009 | title = Social internet sites as a source of public health information | journal = Dermatologic Clinics | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–136 | doi = 10.1016/j.det.2008.11.010 | pmid = 19254656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second sense, "Public Health 2.0" describes public health research that uses data gathered from social networking sites, search engine queries, cell phones, or other technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://governmentfutures.com/images/stories/documents/PublicHealth2-0NotesPRINT.pdf |title=Public Health 2.0: Spreading like a virus |accessdate=13 June 2011 |date=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent example is the proposal of statistical framework that utilizes online user-generated content (from social media or search engine queries) to estimate the impact of an influenza vaccination campaign in the UK.&lt;ref name=DMKD&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lampos |first=Vasileios |last2=Yom-Tov |first2=Elad |last3=Pebody |first3=Richard| last4=Cox |first4=Ingemar J. |date=2 July 2015 |title=Assessing the impact of a health intervention via user-generated Internet content |journal=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery | doi=10.1007/s10618-015-0427-9 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=1434–1457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third sense, "Public Health 2.0" is used to describe public health activities that are completely user-driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.publichealth2point0.ca |title=Public Health 2.0 FAQs |accessdate=13 June 2011 |author=DLSPH Conference Planning Committee | publisher=Public Health 2.0 Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the collection and sharing of information about [[environmental radiation]] levels after the March 2011 tsunami in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2011/04/201142317359479927.html |title=Crowdsourcing Japan's radiation levels |accessdate= 13 June 2011 |author = D. Parvaz |date=26 April 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases, Public Health 2.0 draws on ideas from [[Web 2.0]], such as [[crowdsourcing]], [[information sharing]], and [[user-centred design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Hardey, Michael |date=July 2008 | title = Public health and Web 2.0 | journal = Perspectives in Public Health | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 181–189 | doi=10.1177/1466424008092228}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many individual healthcare providers have started making their own personal contributions to "Public Health 2.0" through personal blogs, social profiles, and websites, other larger organizations, such as the [[American Heart Association]] (AHA) and United Medical Education (UME), have a larger team of employees centered around online driven health education, research, and training. These private organizations recognize the need for free and easy to access health materials often building libraries of educational articles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Developing countries==
[[File:MRT Myanmar.jpg|thumb|Emergency Response Team in [[Burma]] after [[Cyclone Nargis]] in 2008]]
There is a great disparity in access to [[health care]] and public health initiatives between [[developed nations]] and [[developing nations]]. In the developing world, public health infrastructures are still forming. There may not be enough trained [[health workforce|health workers,]] monetary resources or, in some cases, sufficient knowledge to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lincoln C Chen |author2=David Evans |author3=Tim Evans |author4=Ritu Sadana |author5=Barbara Stilwell |author6=Phylida Travis |author7=Wim Van Lerberghe |author8=Pascal Zurn |title=World Health Report 2006: working together for health |location=Geneva |publisher=WHO |year=2006 |oclc=71199185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jamison 15–22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jamison|first=D T|last2=Mosley|first2=W H|date=January 1991|title=Disease control priorities in developing countries: health policy responses to epidemiological change.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=81|issue=1|pages=15–22|doi=10.2105/ajph.81.1.15|pmid=1983911|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1404931}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a large majority of disease and mortality in the developing world results from and contributes to extreme poverty. For example, many African governments spend less than [[United States dollar|US$]]10 per person per year on health care, while, in the United States, the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] spent approximately US$4,500 per capita in 2000. However, expenditures on health care should not be confused with spending on public health. Public health measures may not generally be considered "health care" in the strictest sense. For example, mandating the use of seat belts in cars can save countless lives and contribute to the health of a population, but typically money spent enforcing this rule would not count as money spent on health care.

Large parts of the developing world remained plagued by largely preventable or treatable infectious diseases.  In addition to this however, many [[developing countries]] are also experiencing an epidemiological shift and polarization in which populations are now experiencing more of the effects of chronic diseases as life expectancy increases with, the poorer communities being heavily affected by both chronic and infectious diseases.&lt;ref name="Jamison 15–22"/&gt; Another major public health concern in the developing world is poor [[Maternal health|maternal]] and child health, exacerbated by [[malnutrition]] and poverty.  The [[WHO]] reports that a lack of [[Breastfeeding#Exclusive breastfeeding|exclusive breastfeeding]] during the first six months of life contributes to over a million avoidable child deaths each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/breastfeeding/en/index.html |title=10 facts on breastfeeding |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intermittent preventive therapy]] aimed at treating and preventing [[malaria]] episodes among pregnant women and young children is one public health measure in [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] countries.

Each day brings new front-page headlines about public health: emerging infectious diseases such as [[SARS]], rapidly making its way from China (see [[Public health in China]]) to Canada, the United States and other geographically distant countries; reducing [[health equity|inequities in health care access]] through publicly funded health insurance programs; the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] and its spread from certain high-risk groups to the general population in many countries, such as in [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|South Africa]]; the increase of [[childhood obesity]] and the concomitant increase in type II diabetes among children; the social, economic and health effects of [[adolescent pregnancy]]; and the public health challenges related to [[natural disaster]]s such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]], [[Hurricane Katrina|2005's Hurricane Katrina]] in the United States and the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].

Since the 1980s, the growing field of [[population health]] has broadened the focus of public health from individual behaviors and [[risk factor]]s to population-level issues such as [[health equity|inequality]], poverty, and education. Modern public health is often concerned with addressing determinants of health across a population. There is a recognition that our health is affected by many factors including where we live, genetics, our income, our educational status and our social relationships; these are known as "[[social determinants of health]]". The upstream drivers such as environment, education, employment, income, food security, housing, social inclusion and many others effect the distribution of health between and within populations and are often shaped by policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7JxutqCmctUC&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=health+policy+interventions+-+the+United+Nations#v=onepage&amp;q=health%20policy%20interventions%20-%20the%20United%20Nations&amp;f=false|title=Equity, Social Determinants and Public Health Programmes|last=Organization|first=World Health|date=2010|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241563970|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A social gradient in health runs through society. The poorest generally suffer the worst health, but even the middle classes will generally have worse health outcomes than those of a higher social stratum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Solid Facts: Social Determinants of Health |editor=Richard G. Wilkinson |editor2=Michael G. Marmot |publisher=WHO |year=2003 |oclc=54966941 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new public health advocates for population-based policies that improve health in an equitable manner.

=== Health aid in developing countries ===
{{Main|Aid}}Health aid to developing countries is an important source of public health funding for many developing countries.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendavid|first=Eran|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=Jay|year=2014|title=The Relationship of Health Aid to Population Health Improvements |journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=174|issue=6|pages=881–887|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.292 |pmc=4777302|pmid=24756557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health aid to developing countries has shown a significant increase after World War II as concerns over the spread of disease as a result of globalization increased and the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa surfaced.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Twumasi|first=Patrick|date=1 April 1981|title=Colonialism and international health: A study in social change in Ghana|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0160798781900375|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine.

==== International health aid debates ====
Debates exist questioning the efficacy of international health aid. Proponents of aid claim that health aid from wealthy countries is necessary in order for developing countries to escape the [[poverty trap]]. Opponents of health aid claim that international health aid actually disrupts developing countries' course of development, causes dependence on aid, and in many cases the aid fails to reach its recipients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, recently, health aid was funneled towards initiatives such as financing new technologies like antiretroviral medication, insecticide-treated mosquito nets, and new vaccines. The positive impacts of these initiatives can be seen in the eradication of smallpox and polio; however, critics claim that misuse or misplacement of funds may cause many of these efforts to never come into fruition.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Economic modeling based on the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] and the [[World Health Organization]] has shown a link between international health aid in developing countries and a reduction in adult mortality rates.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, a 2014-2016 study suggests that a potential confounding variable for this outcome is the possibility that aid was directed at countries once they were already on track for improvement.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; That same study, however, also suggests that 1 billion dollars in health aid was associated with 364,000 fewer deaths occurring between ages 0 and 5 in 2011.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Sustainable development goals ===
{{Further|Sustainable Development Goals}}
To address current and future challenges in addressing health issues in the world, the [[United Nations]] have developed the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] building off of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] of 2000 to be completed by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2015 - United Nations sustainable development agenda|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/#|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These goals in their entirety encompass the entire spectrum of development across nations, however Goals 1-6 directly address health disparities, primarily in developing countries.&lt;ref name=UN2015&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sustainable development goals - United Nations|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These six goals address key issues in [[Global health|global public health]]: [[Poverty]], Hunger and [[food security]], Health, Education, [[Gender equality]] and women's empowerment, and water and [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name=UN2015/&gt; Public health officials can use these goals to set their own agenda and plan for smaller scale initiatives for their organizations. These goals hope to lessen the burden of disease and inequality faced by developing countries and lead to a healthier future.

The links between the various sustainable development goals and public health are numerous and well established:
* Living below the poverty line is attributed to poorer health outcomes and can be even worse for persons living in developing countries where [[extreme poverty]] is more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NCCP {{!}} Child Poverty|url = http://www.nccp.org/topics/childpoverty.html|website = www.nccp.org|accessdate = 25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A child born into poverty is twice as likely to die before the age of five compared to a child from a wealthier family.&lt;ref name=UNhealth2015&gt;{{Cite web|title = Health - United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The detrimental effects of hunger and [[malnutrition]] that can arise from systemic challenges with food security are enormous. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that 12.9 percent of the population in developing countries is undernourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hunger and food security - United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Health challenges in the developing world are enormous, with "only half of the women in developing nations receiving the recommended amount of healthcare they need.&lt;ref name=UNhealth2015/&gt; 
* [[Educational equity]] has yet to be reached in the world. Public health efforts are impeded by this, as a lack of education can lead to poorer health outcomes. This is shown by children of mothers who have no education having a lower survival rate compared to children born to mothers with primary or greater levels of education.&lt;ref name=UNhealth2015/&gt; Cultural differences in the role of women vary by country, many gender inequalities are found in developing nations. Combating these inequalities has shown to also lead to better public health outcome. 
* In studies done by the [[World Bank]] on populations in developing countries, it was found that when women had more control over household resources, the children benefit through better access to food, healthcare, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Development Report|url = https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/2124|website = openknowledge.worldbank.org|accessdate = 25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Basic [[sanitation]] resources and access to clean sources of water are a basic [[Right to water|human right]]. However, 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water that is fecally contaminated, and 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation facilities like [[toilet]]s or [[pit latrine]]s.&lt;ref name=UNwater2015&gt;{{Cite web|title = Water and Sanitation - United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of these resources is what causes approximately 1000 children a day to die from [[Diarrhea|diarrhoel diseases]] that could have been prevented from better water and [[sanitation]] infrastructure.&lt;ref name=UNwater2015/&gt;

=== U.S. initiatives ===
{{Main|Global Health Initiatives}}The U.S. Global Health Initiative was created in 2009 by President Obama in an attempt to have a more holistic, comprehensive approach to improving global health as opposed to previous, disease-specific interventions.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8116.pdf|title=The U.S. Global Health Initiative|last=|first=|date=February 2011|website=Kaiser Family Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Health Initiative is a six-year plan, "to develop a comprehensive U.S. government strategy for global health, building on the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) to combat HIV as well as U.S. efforts to address tuberculosis (TB) and malaria, and augmenting the focus on other global health priorities, including neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH), family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH), nutrition, and health systems strengthening (HSS)".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The GHI programs are being implemented in more than 80 countries around the world and works closely with the [[United States Agency for International Development]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

There are seven core principles:

#Women, girls, and gender equality
#Strategic coordination and integration
#Strengthen and leverage key multilaterals and other partners
#Country-ownership
#Sustainability through Health Systems
#Improve metrics, monitoring, and evaluation
#Promote research and innovation&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The aid effectiveness agenda is a useful tool for measuring the impact of these large scale programs such as [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] and the [[Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation|Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]]  (GAVI) which have been successful in achieving rapid and visible results.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Global Fund claims that its efforts have provided antiretroviral treatment for over three million people worldwide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; GAVI claims that its vaccination programs have prevented over 5 million deaths since it began in 2000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Education and training==
Education and training of public health professionals is available throughout the world in Schools of Public Health, Medical Schools, Veterinary Schools, Schools of Nursing, and Schools of Public Affairs. The training typically requires a [[university degree]] with a focus on core disciplines of [[biostatistics]], [[epidemiology]], [[Health administration|health services administration]], [[health policy]], [[health education]], [[behavioral science]], gender issues, sexual and reproductive health, public health nutrition and [[environmental and occupational health]].&lt;ref name=mmwr4850&gt;U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services.

Operational structures are formulated by strategic principles, with educational and career pathways guided by competency frameworks, all requiring modulation according to local, national and global realities. It is critically important for the health of populations that nations assess their public health human resource needs and develop their ability to deliver this capacity, and not depend on other countries to supply it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1159/000354198| pmid=23969636| pmc=5586806|title = The Imperative of Public Health Education: A Global Perspective| journal=Medical Principles and Practice| volume=22| issue=6| pages=515–529|year = 2013|last1 = White|first1 = Franklin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools of public health: a US perspective===
In the [[United States]], the Welch-Rose Report of 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Welch|first1=William H.|last2=Rose|first2=Wickliffe|year=1915|title=Institute of Hygiene: Being a report by Dr. William H.

Even though schools of public health had already been established in [[Canada]], [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]], the United States had still maintained the traditional system of housing faculties of public health within their medical institutions.  A $25,000 donation from businessman [[Samuel Zemurray]] instituted the [[Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine|School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University]] in 1912 conferring its first doctor of public health degree in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darnell|first=Regna|title=Histories of anthropology annual|year=2008|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8032-6664-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyer|first=John Percy|title=Tulane: the biography of a university, 1834-1965|year=1966|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Yale School of Public Health]] was founded by [[Charles-Edward Avory Winslow]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/182530966|title=A history of Yale's School of Medicine : passing torches to others|last=1933-2013,|first=Burrow, Gerard N.,|date=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300132885|location=New Haven|oclc=182530966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]] became an independent, degree-granting institution for research and training in public health, and the largest public health training facility in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;The World Book Encyclopedia, 1994, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Education of the Physician: International Dimensions.

By 1922, schools of public health were established at [[Columbia university|Columbia]] and [[Harvard]] on the Hopkins model. By 1999 there were twenty nine schools of public health in the US, enrolling around fifteen thousand students.&lt;ref name=mmwr4850/&gt;&lt;ref name=PHP/&gt;

Over the years, the types of students and training provided have also changed. In the beginning, students who enrolled in public health schools typically had already obtained a medical degree; public health school training was largely a second degree for [[physician|medical professionals]]. However, in 1978, 69% of American students enrolled in public health schools had only a [[bachelor's degree]].&lt;ref name=mmwr4850/&gt;

===Degrees in public health===
{{Main|Professional degrees of public health}}

Schools of public health offer a variety of degrees which generally fall into two categories: professional or academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceph.org/pdf/Master_List.pdf|title=Schools of Public Health and Public Health Programs|date=11 March 2011|publisher=[[Council on Education for Public Health]]|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major postgraduate degrees are the [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH) or the [[Master of Science]] in Public Health (MSPH). Doctoral studies in this field include [[Doctor of Public Health]] (DrPH) and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) in a subspeciality of greater Public Health disciplines. DrPH is regarded as a professional degree and PhD as more of an academic degree.

Professional degrees are oriented towards practice in public health settings. The [[Master of Public Health]], [[Doctor of Public Health]], [[Doctor of Health Science]] (DHSc) and the [[Master of Health Administration|Master of Health Care Administration]] are examples of degrees which are geared towards people who want careers as practitioners of public health in health departments, managed care and community-based organizations, hospitals and consulting firms, among others. [[Master of Public Health]] degrees broadly fall into two categories, those that put more emphasis on an understanding of epidemiology and statistics as the scientific basis of public health practice and those that include a more eclectic range of methodologies.  A Master of Science of Public Health is similar to an MPH but is considered an academic degree (as opposed to a professional degree) and places more emphasis on scientific methods and research.  The same distinction can be made between the DrPH and the DHSc. The DrPH is considered a professional degree and the DHSc is an academic degree.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Academic degrees are more oriented towards those with interests in the scientific basis of public health and [[preventive medicine]] who wish to pursue careers in research, university teaching in graduate programs, policy analysis and development, and other high-level public health positions. Examples of academic degrees are the [[Master of Science]], [[Doctor of Philosophy]], [[Doctor of Science]] (ScD), and [[Doctor of Health Science]] (DHSc). The doctoral programs are distinct from the MPH and other professional programs by the addition of advanced coursework and the nature and scope of a [[dissertation]] research project.

In the United States, the Association of Schools of Public Health&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asph.org/ Association of Schools of Public Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911051643/http://www.asph.org/ |date=11 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; represents [[Council on Education for Public Health]] (CEPH) accredited schools of public health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceph.org Council on Education for Public Health]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delta Omega]] is the [[honor society]] for graduate studies in public health. The society was founded in 1924 at the [[Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]]. Currently, there are approximately 68 chapters throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deltaomega.org/ Delta Omega website] (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Doutielt3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The primitive nature of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] medicine rendered Europe helpless to the onslaught of the [[Black Death]] in the 14th century. Miniature from "The Chronicles of Gilles Li Muisis" (1272-1352). Bibliothèque royale de Belgique, MS 13076-77, f. 24v.]]
Public health has early roots in antiquity. From the beginnings of [[human civilization]], it was recognized that polluted [[water]] and lack of proper [[waste disposal]] spread communicable diseases (theory of [[miasma theory of disease|miasma]]). Early [[religion]]s attempted to regulate behavior that specifically related to health, from types of [[food]] eaten, to regulating certain indulgent behaviors, such as drinking [[alcohol]] or [[human sexual behaviour|sexual relations]]. [[leadership|Leaders]] were responsible for the health of their subjects to ensure social stability, [[wealth|prosperity]], and maintain order.

By [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, it was well understood that proper [[waste management|diversion of human waste]] was a necessary tenet of public health in urban areas. The [[History of China|ancient Chinese]] [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|medical doctors]] developed the practice of [[variolation]] following a [[smallpox]] epidemic around 1000 BC. An individual without the disease could gain some measure of immunity against it by inhaling the dried crusts that formed around lesions of infected individuals. Also, children were protected by [[inoculation|inoculating]] a scratch on their forearms with the pus from a lesion.

In 1485 the [[Republic of Venice]] established a permanent [[Venetian Magistrate for Health]] comprising supervisors of health with special attention to the prevention of the spread of epidemics in the territory from abroad. The three supervisors were initially appointed by the Venetian Senate. In 1537 it was assumed by the Grand Council, and in 1556 added two judges, with the task of control, on behalf of the Republic, the efforts of the supervisors.

However, according to [[Michel Foucault]], the plague model of [[governmentality]] was later controverted by the [[cholera]] model. A Cholera pandemic devastated Europe between 1829 and 1851, and was first fought by the use of what Foucault called "social medicine", which focused on flux, circulation of air, location of [[cemeteries]], etc. All those concerns, born of the [[miasma theory of disease]], were mixed with [[urbanism|urbanistic]] concerns for the management of populations, which Foucault designated as the concept of "[[biopower]]". The German conceptualized this in the ''[[Polizeiwissenschaft]]'' ("[[Police science]]").

===Modern public health===
The 18th century saw rapid growth in voluntary hospitals in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/History-Britains-Hospitals-Barry-Carruthers/dp/1857769058/ Carruthers, G. Barry. ''History of Britain's Hospitals'' (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the century brought the establishment of the basic pattern of improvements in public health over the next two centuries: a social evil was identified, private philanthropists brought attention to it, and changing public opinion led to government action.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482384/public-health/35547/National-developments-in-the-18th-and-19th-centuries|title=public health|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The cow pock.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|1802 caricature of [[Edward Jenner]] vaccinating patients who feared it would make them sprout cowlike appendages.]]
The practice of [[vaccination]] became prevalent in the 1800s, following the pioneering work of [[Edward Jenner]] in treating [[smallpox]]. [[James Lind]]'s discovery of the causes of [[scurvy]] amongst sailors and its mitigation via the introduction of [[fruit]] on lengthy voyages was published in 1754 and led to the adoption of this idea by the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Vale, Brian. "The Conquest of Scurvy in the Royal Navy 1793–1800: A Challenge to Current Orthodoxy". ''[[The Mariners' Mirror]]'', volume 94, number 2, May 2008, pp. 160–175.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were also made to promulgate health matters to the broader public; in 1752 the British physician Sir [[John Pringle (physician)|John Pringle]] published ''Observations on the Diseases of the Army in Camp and Garrison'', in which he advocated for the importance of adequate ventilation in the [[military]] [[barracks]] and the provision of [[latrine]]s for the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | pmid=5330009 | last=Selwyn | first=S | publication-date=July 1966| year=1966 | title=Sir John Pringle: hospital reformer, moral philosopher and pioneer of antiseptics | volume=10 | issue=3 | periodical=Medical History | pages=266–74 | pmc=1033606 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300011133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], living standards amongst the working population began to worsen, with cramped and unsanitary urban conditions. In the first four decades of the 19th century alone, [[London]]'s population doubled and even greater growth rates were recorded in the new industrial towns, such as [[Leeds]] and [[Manchester]]. This rapid [[urbanisation]] exacerbated the spread of disease in the large [[conurbation]]s that built up around the [[workhouse]]s and [[factory|factories]]. These settlements were cramped and primitive with no organized [[sanitation]]. Disease was inevitable and its incubation in these areas was encouraged by the poor lifestyle of the inhabitants. Unavailable housing led to the rapid growth of [[slum]]s and the [[per capita]] [[death rate]] began to rise alarmingly, almost doubling in [[Birmingham]] and [[Liverpool]]. [[Thomas Malthus]] warned of the dangers of overpopulation in 1798. His ideas, as well as those of [[Jeremy Bentham]], became very influential in government circles in the early years of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

====Public health legislation====
[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]] was a pivotal influence on the early public health campaign.]]
The first attempts at sanitary reform and the establishment of public health institutions were made in the 1840s. [[Thomas Southwood Smith]], physician at the [[London Fever Hospital]], began to write papers on the importance of public health, and was one of the first physicians brought in to give evidence before the [[Poor Law Commission]] in the 1830s, along with [[Neil Arnott]] and [[James Phillips Kay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Amanda J. Thomas|title=The Lambeth cholera outbreak of 1848-1849: the setting, causes, course and aftermath of an epidemic in London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XGLd5hQ1-8UC&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate=5 April 2012|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3989-8|pages=55–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith advised the government on the importance of [[quarantine]] and sanitary improvement for limiting the spread of infectious diseases such as [[cholera]] and [[yellow fever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret Stacey|title=The Sociology of Health and Healing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IAUjCaEtCoC&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=5 April 2012|date=1 June 2004|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=978-0-203-38004-8|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Samuel Edward Finer]]|title=The Life and Times of Sir Edwin Chadwick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JycOAAAAQAAJ|year=1952|publisher=Methuen|isbn=978-0-416-17350-5|pages=424–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poor Law Commission]] reported in 1838 that "the expenditures necessary to the adoption and maintenance of measures of prevention would ultimately amount to less than the cost of the disease now constantly engendered". It recommended the implementation of large scale government [[engineering]] projects to alleviate the conditions that allowed for the propagation of disease.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The [[Health of Towns Association]] was formed in [[Exeter]] on 11 December 1844, and vigorously campaigned for the development of public health in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Ashton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashton|first=John|author2=Ubido, Janet|title=The Healthy City and the Ecological Idea|journal=Journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine|year=1991|volume=4|issue=1|pages=173–181|url=http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2013|doi=10.1093/shm/4.1.173|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102422/http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|archivedate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its formation followed the 1843 establishment of the Health of Towns Commission, chaired by Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]], which produced a series of reports on poor and insanitary conditions in British cities.&lt;ref name=Ashton/&gt;

These national and local movements led to the [[Public Health Act 1848|Public Health Act]], finally passed in 1848. It aimed to improve the sanitary condition of towns and populous places in England and Wales by placing the supply of water, sewerage, drainage, cleansing and paving under a single local body with the General Board of Health as a central authority. The Act was passed by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[First Russell ministry|government]] of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], in response to the urging of [[Edwin Chadwick]]. Chadwick's seminal report on ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' was published in 1842&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=excerpt from ''Report...from the Poor Law Commissioners on an Inquiry into the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population of Great Britain'' (pp.369-372) (online source)|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chadwick2.html|last=Chadwick|first=Edwin|chapter=Chadwick's Report on Sanitary Conditions | year=1842| publisher=to The Victorian Web|location=added by Laura Del Col|accessdate=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed up with a supplementary report a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain.

[[Vaccination]] for various diseases was made compulsory in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1851, and by 1871 legislation required a comprehensive system of registration run by appointed vaccination officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue?sn=4127 |title=Decline of Infant Mortality in England and Wales, 1871-1948 : a Medical Conundrum|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further interventions were made by a series of subsequent [[Public Health Acts]], notably the [[Public Health Act 1875|1875 Act]]. Reforms included latrinization, the building of [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, the regular [[waste disposal|collection of garbage]] followed by [[incineration]] or disposal in a [[landfill]], the [[History of water supply|provision of clean water]] and the draining of standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.

The [[Infectious Disease (Notification) Act 1889]] mandated the reporting of infectious diseases to the local sanitary authority, which could then pursue measures such as the removal of the patient to hospital and the disinfection of homes and properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intrusive Interventions: Public Health, Domestic Space, and Infectious Disease Surveillance in England, 1840-1914|last = Mooney|first = Graham|publisher = University of Rochester Press|year = 2015|isbn = 9781580465274|location = Rochester, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the first public health organization based on a state health department and local boards of health was founded in [[New York City]] in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;United States Public Health Service, ''Municipal Health Department Practice for the Year 1923'' (Public Health Bulletin # 164, July 1926), pp.  348, 357, 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The science of [[epidemiology]] was founded by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 [[cholera]] outbreak in London. Dr. Snow believed in the [[germ theory]] of disease as opposed to the prevailing [[Miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]]. He first publicized his theory in an essay, ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'', in 1849, followed by a more detailed treatise in 1855 incorporating the results of his investigation of the role of the water supply in the [[Soho]] epidemic of 1854.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t1exE1cfKXIC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22institut+de+france%22+and+%22john+snow%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=4Kx7TNabHdOeOM_xgdQG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22institut%20de%20france%22%20and%20%22john%20snow%22&amp;f=false ''Concepts and practice of humanitarian medicine'' (2008) Par S.

By talking to local residents (with the help of [[Reverend Henry Whitehead]]), he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now [[Broadwick Street]]).  Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the [[Broad Street pump]] did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle.&lt;ref&gt;Vinten-Johansen, Peter,  ''et al.'' (2003). ''Cholera, Chloroform, and the Science of Medicine: A Life of John Snow''. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-513544-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow later used a [[dot distribution map|dot map]] to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump.  He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases.  He showed that the [[Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company]] was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the [[Thames]] and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography.  It is regarded as the founding event of the science of [[epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Berlin Johnson|Johnson, Steven]] (2006).

====Disease control====
[[File:Paul-Louis Simond injecting plague vaccine June 4th 1898 Karachi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Paul-Louis Simond]] injecting a plague vaccine in Karachi, 1898.]]
With the pioneering work in [[bacteriology]] of French chemist [[Louis Pasteur]] and German scientist [[Robert Koch]], methods for isolating the [[bacteria]] responsible for a given disease and vaccines for remedy were developed at the turn of the 20th century. British physician [[Ronald Ross]] identified the [[mosquito]] as the carrier of [[malaria]] and laid the foundations for combating the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://easternpanorama.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1123&amp;Itemid=10|title=:: Laboc Hospital - A Noble Prize Winner's Workplace|publisher=easternpanorama.in|accessdate=11 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105175214/http://easternpanorama.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1123&amp;Itemid=10|archivedate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] revolutionized [[surgery]] by the introduction of [[antiseptic]] [[surgery]] to eliminate [[infection]]. French epidemiologist [[Paul-Louis Simond]] proved that [[plague (disease)|plague]] was carried by [[flea]]s on the back of [[rat]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Marriott (1966) in “Plague. A Story of Science, Rivalry and the Scourge That Won't Go Away” {{ISBN|978-1-4223-5652-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cuban scientist [[Carlos J.

With onset of the [[epidemiological transition]] and as the prevalence of [[Infectious disease in the 20th century|infectious diseases decreased through the 20th century]], public health began to put more focus on [[chronic diseases]] such as [[cancer]] and [[heart disease]]. Previous efforts in many developed countries had already led to dramatic reductions in the [[infant mortality rate]] using preventative methods. In Britain, the infant mortality rate fell from over 15% in 1870 to 7% by 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=wps-48-2012.pdf&amp;site=24|title=The declines in infant mortality and fertility: Evidence from British cities in demographic transition |accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Country examples ===
====France====
[[French Third Republic|France 1871-1914]]  followed well behind Bismarckian Germany, as well as Great Britain, in developing the welfare state including public health.  Tuberculosis was the most dreaded disease of the day, especially striking young people in their 20s.  Germany set up vigorous measures of public hygiene and public sanatoria, but France let private physicians handle the problem, which left it with a much higher death rate.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Mitchell, ''The Divided Path: The German Influence on Social Reform in France After 1870'' (1991) pp 252-75 [https://www.amazon.com/Divided-Path-German-Influence-Social/dp/0807857432 excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;  The French medical profession jealously guarded its prerogatives, and public health activists were not as well organized or as influential as in Germany, Britain or the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Martha L. Hildreth, ''Doctors, Bureaucrats &amp; Public Health in France, 1888-1902'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alisa Klaus, ''Every Child a Lion: The Origins of Maternal &amp; Infant Health Policy in the United States &amp; France, 1890-1920'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there was a long battle over a [[public health law]] which began in the 1880s as a campaign to reorganize the nation's health services, to require the registration of infectious diseases, to mandate quarantines, and to improve the deficient health and housing legislation of 1850. However the reformers met opposition from bureaucrats, politicians, and physicians. Because it was so threatening to so many interests, the proposal was debated and postponed for 20 years before becoming law in 1902. Success finally came when the government realized that contagious diseases had a national security impact in weakening military recruits, and keeping the population growth rate well below Germany's.&lt;ref&gt;Ann-Louise Shapiro, "Private Rights, Public Interest, and Professional Jurisdiction: The French Public Health Law of 1902." ''Bulletin of the History of Medicine'' 54.1 (1980): 4+&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====

{{see also|United States Public Health Service}}

Modern public health began developing in the 19th century, as a response to advances in science that led to the understanding of, the source and spread of disease. As the knowledge of contagious diseases increased, means to control them and prevent infection were soon developed. Once it became understood that these strategies would require community-wide participation, disease control began being viewed as a public responsibility. Various organizations and agencies were then created to implement these disease preventing strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218224/|title=A History of the Public Health System|last=Health|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee for the Study of the Future of Public|date=1988|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Public health activity in the United States took place at the municipal level before the mid-20th century. There was some activity at the national and state level as well.&lt;ref&gt;John Duffy, ''The sanitarians: a history of American public health'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the administration of the second president of the United States [[John Adams]], the Congress authorized the creation of hospitals for mariners.  As the U.S. expanded, the scope of the governmental health agency expanded.
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Visiting_Nurse_Service_of_New_York_Logo.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Logo of the [[Visiting Nurse Service of New York]], founded by nursing pioneer [[Lillian Wald]] in 1893]] --&gt;
In the United States, public health worker [[Sara Josephine Baker]], M.D. established many programs to help the poor in New York City keep their infants healthy, leading teams of nurses into the crowded neighborhoods of [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] and teaching mothers how to dress, feed, and bathe their babies.

Another key pioneer of public health in the U.S. was [[Lillian Wald]], who founded the [[Henry Street Settlement]] house in New York.  The [[Visiting Nurse Service of New York]] was a significant organization for bringing health care to the urban poor.

Dramatic increases in average life span in the late 19th century and 20th century, is widely credited to public health achievements, such as [[vaccination]] programs and control of many infectious diseases including [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], [[diphtheria]], [[yellow fever]] and [[smallpox]]; effective health and safety policies such as [[road traffic safety]] and [[Occupational safety and health|occupational safety]]; improved [[family planning]]; [[tobacco control]] measures; and programs designed to decrease [[non-communicable disease]]s by acting on known risk factors such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment.

Another major public health improvement was the decline in the "urban penalty" brought about by improvements in [[sanitation]]. These improvements included [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of drinking water, filtration and [[sewage treatment]] which led to the decline in deaths caused by infectious [[waterborne diseases]] such as [[cholera]] and intestinal diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutler|first=David|author2=Grant Miller |title=The Role of Public Health Improvements in Health Advances: The Twentieth Century United States |journal=[[Demography (journal)|Demography]] |date=February 2004 |volume=42 |issue=1 |oclc=703811616 |doi=10.1353/dem.2005.0002|pages=1–22|pmid=15782893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The federal Office of Indian Affairs (OIA) operated a large-scale field nursing program. Field nurses targeted native women for health education, emphasizing personal hygiene and infant care and nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hancock Christin L | year = 2001 | title = Healthy Vocatoons:  Field Nursing and the Religious Overtones of Public Health | url = | journal = [[Journal of Women's History]] | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 113–137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mexico====
{{see also|Healthcare in Mexico#Public healthcare delivery}}
[[File:IMSS.jpg|thumb|right|Logo for the [[Mexican Social Security Institute]], a governmental agency dealing with public health.]]
Public health issues were important for the [[Spanish empire]] during the colonial era.  Epidemic disease was the main factor in the decline of indigenous populations in the era immediately following the sixteenth-century conquest era and was a problem during the colonial era. The Spanish crown took steps in eighteenth-century Mexico to bring in regulations to make populations healthier.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Cooper, ''Epidemic Disease in Mexico City, 1761-1813: An Administrative, Social, and Medical History''. Austin: University of Texas Press 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth century, Mexico was in the process of modernization, and public health issues were again tackled from a scientific point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriela Soto Laveaga and Claudia Agostoni, "Science and Public Health in the Century of Revolution," in ''A Companion to Mexican History and Culture'', William H. Beezley, ed. Blackwell Publishing 2011, pp. 561-574.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Agostoni, ''Monuments of Progress: Modernization and Public Health in Mexico City, 1876-1910''.

Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even during the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–20), public health was an important concern, with a text on hygiene published in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto J. Pani, ''La higiene en México''. Mexico: Imprenta de J. Ballescá 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Mexican Revolution, feminist and trained nurse [[Elena Arizmendi Mejia]] founded the [[Neutral White Cross]], treating wounded soldiers no matter for what faction they fought.

In the post-revolutionary period after 1920, improved public health was a revolutionary goal of the Mexican government.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Elaine Bliss, "The Science of Redemption: Syphilis, Sexual Promiscuity, and Reformism in Revolutionary Mexico City" ''[[Hispanic American Historical Review]]'' 79:1 1999, pp. 1-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Aréchiga Córdoba, "Educación, propaganda o 'Dictadura sanitaria'. Estrategias discursivas de higiene y salubridad pública en el México posrevolucionario, 1917-1934". Dynamis 25, 2005, pp. 117-143.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Mexican state promoted the health of the Mexican population, with most resources going to cities.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Mazzaferri, "Public Health and Social Revolution in Mexico." PhD dissertation, Kent State University 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Sowell, ''Medicine on the Periphery: Public Health in Yucatán, 1870-1960''. Lanham: Lexington Books 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Concern about disease conditions and social impediments to the improvement of Mexicans' health were important in the formation of the [[Eugenics in Mexico|Mexican Society for Eugenics]]. The movement flourished from the 1920s to the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Minna Stern, "Responsible Mother and Normal Children: Eugenics, Nationalism, and Welfare in Post-revolutionary Mexico, 1920-1940." ''Journal of Historical Sociology'' vol. 12, no. 4, December 1999, pp. 369-397.&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico was not alone in Latin America or the world in promoting [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Leys Stepan, ''The Hour of Eugenics: Race, Gender, and Nation in Latin America''. Ithaca: Cornell University Press 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Government campaigns against disease and alcoholism were also seen as promoting public health.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Pierce, "Fighting Bacteria, the Bible, and the Bottle: Projects to Create New Men, Women, and Children, 1910-1940" in ''Companion to Mexican History and Culture'', William H. Beezley, ed. Wiley-Blackwell Publishers, pp. 505-517.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Mitchell, ''Intoxicated Identities: Alcohol's Power in Mexican History and Culture''. Routledge 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] was established in 1943, during the administration of President [[Manuel Avila Camacho]] to deal with public health, pensions, and social security.

====Cuba====
{{see also|Timeline of healthcare in Cuba}}
Since the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]] the [[Cuban government]] has devoted extensive resources to the improvement of [[Healthcare in Cuba|health conditions]] for its entire population via universal access to health care. Infant mortality has plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;Pineo, “Public Health”, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuban medical internationalism]] as a policy has seen the Cuban government sent doctors as a form of aid and export to countries in need in Latin America, especially [[Mission Barrio Adentro|Venezuela]], as well as Oceania and Africa countries.

====Colombia and Bolivia====
Public health was important elsewhere in Latin America in consolidating state power and integrating marginalized populations into the nation-state.  In Colombia, public health was a means for creating and implementing ideas of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Hanni Jalil, "Curing a Sick Nation: Public Health and Citizenship in Colombia, 1930-1940." PhD dissertation, University of California, Santa Barbara 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bolivia, a similar push came after their 1952 revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Pacino, "Prescription for a Nation: Public Health in Post-Revolutionary Bolivia, 1952-1964." PhD dissertation, University of California, Santa Barbara 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Railway Technical Centre''' (RTC) in London Road, [[Derby]], England, was built by the [[British Railways Board]] in the early 1960s to be its technical headquarters. [[British Rail]] was able to announce that "The Railway Technical Centre at Derby is the largest railway research complex in the world."

The RTC centralised most of the technical services provided by the regional Chief Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineers (CM&amp;EE) to form the Department of Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineering (DM&amp;EE). In addition, it housed the newly formed [[British Rail Research Division]] which reported directly to the Board. The latter is well known for its work on the experimental [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT-E). At that early stage this was a concept vehicle, and in time the DM&amp;EE applied the new knowledge to existing practice in the design of the [[InterCity 125|High Speed Train]] (HST), the later prototype APT-P and other high-speed vehicles.

==History==
===Opening===
The Research Division was the first to move into the purpose-built accommodation on London Road. This was formed initially with personnel from other departments around the country, including the Electrical Research Division from [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], the Mechanical Engineers Research Section,  the Civil Engineering Research Unit (Track Lab), and the Chemical Research Unit, while the Scientific Services Division occupied the former [[LMS Scientific Research Laboratory]] building across the road known as Hartley House. The embryo RTC site (mainly Kelvin House and the Research Test Hall) was officially opened by the [[Duke of Edinburgh]] in May 1964.&lt;ref&gt;"British Railways Research Department Expanded" ''[[Railway Gazette International|Railway Gazette]]'' 5 June 1964 page 425&lt;/ref&gt; Later additional buildings were added: Trent House and Derwent House, the Advanced Projects lab, then Stephenson House, Lathkill House and finally Brunel House. 

===Department of Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineering===
In addition to the research employees, the RTC became the headquarters of the DM&amp;EE. This brought together engineers from the regional departments, together with its Drawing Offices, the Testing &amp; Performance Section and the Engineering Development Unit workshop (EDU) from [[Darlington]], the Workshops Division (which later became [[British Rail Engineering Limited]]) and it was also home to the Board's Central Purchasing Department. Strange to relate but the layout of equipment within the new workshop was as near as possible the same as the original. Following this came the Plastics Development Unit from [[Eastleigh]], which, among other innovations, was responsible for the design of the High Speed Train's streamlined cabs as well as the prototype [[British Rail Mark 3|Mark 3]] coach doors.

===Test tracks===
When research and testing required stretches of real railway line, the Research Division used the [[Old Dalby Test Track]], and at [[Mickleover]] in Derby and The High Marnham Test Track, the former LD&amp;ECR from Shirebrook to Tuxford where one of Network Rail's RIDC is located.

== RTC today ==
At [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatisation]], most of the facilities were taken over by commercial railway engineering companies, and it was marketed as the "rtc Business Park" renting space to a range of small consultancy firms. 

===Research===
The only facility which is still used for railway research is the moving-model aerodynamic test facility. 

===Repairs===
The former RTC site is also used by [[LORAM Maintenance of Way, Inc.#United Kingdom|LORAM]] to carry out repairs and maintenance on railway vehicles. It was also used by Rampart Carriage &amp; Wagon Services (RC&amp;WS) which went into liquidation in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/L-60495-1816069 |title=Rampart Carriage &amp; Wagon Services Ltd |publisher=Thegazette.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage===
A large part of the site is used as storage and an operating base by LORAM and [[Network Rail]], whose rolling stock on site forms part of Network Rail testing trains. Usual traction on these trains is either [[Colas Rail]] [[British Rail Class 37|class 37s]] or [[British Rail class 67|class 67s]]. The [[New Measurement Train]] and LORAM C21 Grinding/Rail Profile Trains are also maintained at this facility.

'''Sawdust''' or '''wood dust''' is a by-product or waste product of woodworking operations such as sawing, milling, planing, routing, drilling and sanding. It is composed of fine particles of wood. These operations can be performed by woodworking machinery, portable power tools or by use of hand tools.  Wood dust is also the byproduct of certain animals, birds and insects which live in wood, such as the [[woodpecker]] and [[carpenter ant]]. In some manufacturing industries it can be a significant fire hazard and source of occupational dust exposure. 

Sawdust is the main component of [[particleboard]]. Wood dust is a form of particulate matter, or [[particulates]]. Research on wood dust health hazards comes within the field of occupational health science, and study of wood dust control comes within the field of indoor air quality engineering.

==Formation==
Two waste products, dust and chips, form at the working surface during woodworking operations such as sawing, milling and sanding.  These operations both shatter lignified wood cells and break out whole cells and groups of cells. Shattering of wood cells creates dust, while breaking out of whole groups of wood cells creates chips. The more cell-shattering that occurs, the finer the dust particles that are produced. For example, sawing and milling are mixed cell shattering and chip forming processes, whereas sanding is almost exclusively cell shattering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol62/mono62-6.pdf IARC 1995. ''Wood Dust''. In ''IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans''. Volume 62: Wood Dust and Formaldehyde. Lyon, France: World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer, p.70.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
A major use of sawdust is for particleboard; coarse sawdust may be used for [[Pulp (paper)|wood pulp]]. Sawdust has a variety of other practical uses, including serving as a [[mulch]], as an alternative to clay [[litter box|cat litter]], or as a [[fuel]]. Until the advent of refrigeration, it was often used in [[Icehouse (building)|icehouses]] to keep ice frozen during the summer. It has been used in [[art|artistic displays]], and as [[scatter (modeling)|scatter]] in [[model railroading|miniature railroad]] and other models. It is also sometimes used to soak up liquid spills, allowing the spill to be easily collected or swept aside.  As such, it was formerly common on barroom floors.&lt;ref&gt;Felman, David (2005) "Why Did Bars Used to Put Sawdust on the Floor? Why Don't They Anymore?" ''Why Do Elephant's Jump?'' HarperCollins, New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3akztvHXlf0C&amp;pg=PA118 page 118], {{ISBN|978-0-06-053914-6}}, quoting Christopher Halleron, bartender and beer columnist.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to make [[Cutler's resin]]. Mixed with water and frozen, it forms [[pykrete]], a slow-melting, much stronger form of [[ice]].

Sawdust is used in the manufacture of [[Briquette|charcoal briquettes]]. The claim for invention of the first commercial charcoal briquettes goes to [[Henry Ford]] who created them from the wood scraps and sawdust produced by his automobile factory.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Harvey (2006) ''Wood: Craft, Culture, History'' Penguin Books, New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQzZri48QvcC&amp;pg=PT403 page 403], {{ISBN|978-1-1012-0185-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in food===
Cellulose, fibre starch that is indigestible to humans, and a filler in some low calorie foods, can be and is made from sawdust, as well as from other plant sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Nassauer, Sarah|title=Why Wood Pulp Makes Ice Cream Creamier |date=4 May 2011|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703834804576300991196803916|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no documentation&lt;ref&gt;Packing houses formerly purchased large quantities of sawdust for the cutting room floors, and still purchase sawdust for use as a fuel and flavoring in the smoking process.&lt;/ref&gt; for the persistent rumor, based upon [[Upton Sinclair]]'s novel ''[[The Jungle]]'', that sawdust was used as a filler in sausage, cellulose derived from sawdust was and is used for sausage casings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x6556e/X6556E03.htm|author=Savic, I. V.|title=Small-scale sausage production: Sausage Casings|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) | location    = Rome|date=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sawdust-derived cellulose has also been used as a filler in bread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bread Labels on Wood Fiber Draw Attack|date=9 October 1985|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-10-09/news/mn-16819_1_high-fiber-bread|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916223613/http://articles.latimes.com/1985-10-09/news/mn-16819_1_high-fiber-bread|archivedate=16 September 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When cereals were scarce, sawdust was sometimes an ingredient in Kommissbrot. [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] survivor, Dr. [[Miklós Nyiszli]], reports in ''Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account'' that the subaltern medical staff, who served [[Josef Mengele|Dr. Josef Mengele]], subsisted on "bread made from wild [[Chestnut#Nutrition|chestnuts]] sprinkled with sawdust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nyiszli, Miklos|title=Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account|chapter=3|date=2011|publisher=New York: Arcade Publishing|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health hazards ==
Airborne sawdust and sawdust accumulations present a number of health and safety hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statefundca.com/safety/safetymeeting/SafetyMeetingArticle.aspx?ArticleID=125
 | title=Wood Dust Exposure
 | publisher=State Compensation Insurance Fund | accessdate=April 30, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504235537/http://www.statefundca.com/safety/safetymeeting/SafetyMeetingArticle.aspx?ArticleID=125 | archivedate=May 4, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood dust becomes a potential health problem when, for example, the wood particles, from processes such as sanding, become airborne and are inhaled. Wood dust is a known human [[carcinogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/profiles/wooddust.pdf | title=Report on Carcinogens, Twelfth Edition, Wood Dust | accessdate=July 12, 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217080608/http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/profiles/WoodDust.pdf | archivedate=February 17, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/newhomeroc/roc10/wd_no_appendices_508.pdf | title=FINAL Report on Carcinogens Background Document for Wood Dust | accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain woods and their dust contain toxins that can produce severe allergic reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Meier, Eric|title=Wood Allergies and Toxicity|publisher=The Wood Database| url=http://www.wood-database.com/wood-articles/wood-allergies-and-toxicity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breathing airborne wood dust may cause allergic respiratory symptoms, mucosal and non-allergic respiratory symptoms, and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/wooddust/index.html United Startes Department of Labor: Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Wood Dust.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA, lists of carcinogenic factors are published by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). All these organisations recognize wood dust as carcinogenic in relation to the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/11_07_s5/pdf/43_11_07_s5_article.pdf Baran, S., &amp; Teul, I. 2007. Wood Dust: An Occupational Hazard Which Increases the Risk of Respiratory Disease. Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology 58, Suppl. 5, pp.43-50.]&lt;/ref&gt;

People can be exposed to wood dust in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, or eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for wood dust exposure in the workplace as 15&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; total exposure and 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an 8-hour workday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Wood dust|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0667.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Respirable particulates ===
As with all airborne [[particulates]], wood dust particle sizes are classified with regard to effect on the human respiratory system.  For this classification, the unit for measurement of particle sizes is the micrometre or micron (μm), where 1 micrometre = 1 micron. Particles below 50 μm are not normally visible to the naked human eye.&lt;ref&gt;Yuanhui Zhang, 2004. ''Indoor Air Quality Engineering''. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Particles of concern for human respiratory health are those &lt;100 μm (where the symbol &lt; means ‘less than’).

Zhang (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Yuanhui Zhang, 2004. ''Indoor Air Quality Engineering''. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; has defined the size of indoor particulates according to respiratory fraction:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Respiratory fraction !! Size range
|-
| Inhalable || ≤ 100 μm
|-
| Thoracic || ≤10 μm
|-
| Respirable || ≤4 μm
|-
| Diminutive || ≤0.5 μm
|}

Particles which precipitate in the vicinity of the mouth and eyes, and get into the organism, are defined as the inhalable fraction, that is total dust. Smaller fractions, penetrating into the non-cartilage respiratory tract, are defined as respirable dust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/11_07_s5/pdf/43_11_07_s5_article.pdf Baran, S., &amp; Teul, I. 2007. Wood Dust: An Occupational Hazard Which Increases the Risk of Respiratory Disease. Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology 58, Suppl. 5, pp.43-50.]&lt;/ref&gt; Dust emitted in the wood industry is characterized by the dimensional disintegration of particles up to 5&amp;nbsp;μm, and that
is why they precipitate mostly in the nasal cavity, increasing the risk of cancer of the upper respiratory tract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/11_07_s5/pdf/43_11_07_s5_article.pdf Baran, S., &amp; Teul, I. 2007. Wood Dust: An Occupational Hazard Which Increases the Risk of Respiratory Disease. Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology 58, Suppl. 5, pp.43-50.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exposure ===
The parameter most commonly used to characterize exposures to wood dust in air is total wood dust concentration, in mass per unit volume. In countries that use the metric system, this is usually measured in mg/m³ (milligram per cubic metre)&lt;ref&gt;[http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol62/mono62-6.pdf IARC 1995. IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans. Volume 62: Wood Dust and Formaldehyde. Lyon, France: World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer, p.66.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A study to estimate occupational exposure to inhalable wood dust by country, industry, the level of exposure and type of wood dust in 25 member states of the European Union (EU-25) found that in 2000–2003, about 3.6 million workers (2.0% of the employed EU-25 population) were occupationally exposed to inhalable wood dust. The highest exposure levels were estimated to occur in the construction sector and furniture industry.&lt;ref&gt;Kaupinnen, T., et.al. 2006 Occupational Exposure to Inhalable Wood Dust in the Member States of the European Union. Ann Occup Hyg (2006) 50 (6): 549-561.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancer ===
Wood dust is known to be a human carcinogen, based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans. It has been demonstrated through human epidemiologic studies that exposure to wood dust increases the occurrence of cancer of the nose (nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses). An association of wood dust exposure and cancers of the nose has been observed in numerous case reports, cohort studies, and case control studies specifically addressing nasal cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/newhomeroc/roc10/wd.pdf Final Report on Carcinogens. Background Document for Wood Dust. Meeting of the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors, December 13–14, 2000. Research Triangle Park, NC: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service National Toxicology Program / Durham, NC: Technology Planning and Management Corporation.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417232235/http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/newhomeroc/roc10/WD.pdf |date=2012-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other safety hazards of wood dust==
Water-borne [[bacteria]] digest organic material in leachate, but use up much of the available oxygen. This high "biological oxygen demand" can suffocate fish and other organisms. There is an equally detrimental effect on beneficial bacteria, so it is not at all advisable to use sawdust within home aquariums, as was once done by hobbyists seeking to save some expense on activated charcoal.

===Explosions and fire===
{{Main|Combustibility#Combustible dust|Dust explosion}}
Sawdust is flammable and accumulations provide a ready source of fuel.  Airborne sawdust can be ignited by sparks or even heat accumulation and result in explosions.

===Environmental effects===
At [[sawmill]]s, unless reprocessed into particleboard, burned in a sawdust burner or used to make heat for other milling operations, sawdust may collect in piles and add harmful [[leachate]]s into local water systems, creating an [[environmental hazard]]. This has placed small sawyers and environmental agencies in a deadlock.

Questions about the science behind the determination of sawdust being an environmental hazard remain for sawmill operators (though this is mainly with finer particles), who compare wood residuals to dead trees in a forest. Technical advisors have reviewed some of the environmental studies, but say most lack standardized methodology or evidence of a direct impact on [[wildlife]]. They don’t take into account large [[drainage area]]s, so the amount of material that is getting into the water from the site in relation to the total drainage area is minuscule.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Other scientists have a different view, saying the "dilution is the solution to pollution" argument is no longer accepted in environmental science. The decomposition of a tree in a forest is similar to the impact of sawdust, but the difference is of scale. Sawmills may be storing thousands of cubic metres of [[wood residues]] in one place, so the issue becomes one of concentration.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

But of larger concern are substances such as [[lignin]]s and [[fatty acid]]s that protect trees from predators while they are alive, but can leach into water and poison wildlife. Those types of things remain in the tree and, as the tree decays, they slowly are broken down. But when sawyers are processing a large volume of wood and large concentrations of these materials permeate into the runoff, the [[toxicity]] they cause is harmful  to a broad range of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/SO05/indepth/environment.asp Canadian Geographic Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428075135/http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/SO05/indepth/environment.asp |date=2006-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wood dust control==
To lower the concentration of airborne dust concentrations during woodworking, dust extraction systems are used. These can be divided into two types. The first are local exhaust ventilation systems, the second are room ventilation systems. Use of personal [[respirator]]s, a form of [[personal protective equipment]], can also isolate workers from dust.

===Local exhaust ventilation (LEV) systems===
These rely on air pulled with a suction force through piping systems from the point of dust formation to a waste disposal unit. LEV systems consist of four elements: dust hoods at the point of dust formation, ventilation ducts, an air cleaning device (waste separator or dust collector) and an air moving device (a fan, otherwise known as an impeller).&lt;ref&gt;Mutchler, J.E., 1973. ''Chapter 41: Local Exhaust Systems''. In: ''The Industrial Environment: its Evaluation and Control''. Washington: US Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NOISH). www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/74-177-w.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The air, containing dust and chips from the woodworking operation, is sucked by an impeller. The impeller is usually built into, or placed close to, the waste disposal unit, or dust collector.

Guidelines of performance for woodworking LEV systems exist, and these tie into occupational air quality regulations that exist in many countries. The LEV guidelines often referred to are those set by the ACIAH.

====Low Volume/High Velocity (LVHV) systems====
Low-volume/high-velocity capture systems are a specialised type of LEV that use an extractor hood designed as an integral part of the tool or positioned very close to the operating point of the cutting tool. The hood is designed to provide high capture velocities, often greater than 50&amp;nbsp;m/s (10,000 fpm) at the contaminant release point. This high velocity is accompanied by airflows often less than 0.02m3/s (50 cfm) resulting from the small face area of the hood that is used.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, W.A., et. al., 2004. ''Ventilation for Control of the Work Environment'', 2nd ed. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; These systems have come into favour for portable power tools, although adoption of the technology is not widespread. Festool is one manufacturer of portable power tools using LVHV ventilation integrated into the tool design.

===Room ventilation systems===
If suitably designed, general ventilation can also be used as a control of airborne dust. General ventilation can often help reduce skin and clothing contamination, and dust deposition on surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/occupational_health/publications/en/oehairbornedust.pdf WHO, 1999. Hazard Prevention and Control in the Work Environment: Airborne Dust. WHO/SDE/OEH/99.14. Geneva: World Health Organization, Department of Protection of the Human Environment, Occupational and Environmental Health. p.98.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air quality standards for respirable wood dust==
Within industry, many countries have air quality regulations. This is to help ensure that wood dust is extracted to a level that ensures specified maximum allowable residual airborne dust concentrations and worker exposure levels.

Winogradsky discovered the first known form of [[lithotrophy]] during his research with ''[[Beggiatoa]]'' in 1887.  He reported that ''Beggiatoa'' oxidized [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) as an energy source and formed intracellular [[sulfur]] droplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Winogradsky S | title = Über Schwefelbakterien| journal = Bot. Zeitung | volume = | issue = 45 | pages = 489–610| year = 1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This research provided the first example of lithotrophy, but not [[autotrophy]].

His research on [[nitrifying bacteria]] would report the first known form of [[chemotroph|chemoautotrophy]], showing how a lithotroph [[carbon fixation|fixes carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to make [[organic compound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Dworkin |first1= Martin |last2=Falkow|first2=Stanley| title= The Prokaryotes: A Handbook on the Biology of Bacteria: Proteobacteria: Gamma Subclass| year= 2006 | edition=3rd |publisher= Springer| page= 784| url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r21k000qn714j380/| isbn= 978-0-387-25496-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Winogradsky was born in [[Kiev]] (then in the [[Russian Empire]]). In this early stage of his life, Winogradsky was "strictly devoted to the [[Russian Orthodox Church|orthodox faith]]", though he later became irreligious.&lt;ref&gt;[[Selman Abraham Waksman|Waksman, Selman Abraham]]. 1953. ''Sergei N. Winogradsky: His Life and Work: The Story of a Great Bacteriologist''. Rutgers University Press. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory|Imperial Conservatoire of Music in St Petersburg]] in 1875 to study piano.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; However, after two years of music training, he entered the [[University of Saint Petersburg]] in 1877 to study chemistry under [[Menshutkin reaction|Nikolai Menshchutkin]] and botany under [[Andrei Famintsyn|Andrei Sergeevich Famintzin]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

He received a diploma in 1881 and stayed at the [[St. Petersburg University]] for a degree of master of science in botany in 1884. In 1885, he began work at the [[University of Strasbourg]] under the renowned botanist [[Anton de Bary]]; Winogradsky became renowned for his work on sulfur bacteria.

In 1888, he relocated to [[Zurich]], where he began investigation into the process of nitrification, identifying the genera ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' and ''[[Nitrifying bacteria|Nitrosococcus]]'', which oxidizes [[ammonium]] to [[nitrite]], and ''[[Nitrobacter]]'', which oxidizes nitrite to [[nitrate]].

He returned to St. Petersburg for the period 1891–1905, and headed the division of general microbiology of the Institute of Experimental Medicine; during this period, he identified the obligate anaerobe ''[[Clostridium|Clostridium pasteurianum]]'', which is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen.

In 1901, he was elected honorary member of the [[Moscow Society of Naturalists]] and, in 1902, corresponding member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]].

He retired from active scientific work in 1905, dividing his time between his private estate and Switzerland. In 1922, he accepted an invitation to head the division of agricultural bacteriology at the [[Pasteur Institute]] at an experimental station at [[Brie-Comte-Robert]], France, about 30&amp;nbsp;km from Paris. During this period, he worked on a number of topics, among them iron bacteria, nitrifying bacteria, [[nitrogen fixation]] by ''[[Azotobacter]]'', [[cellulose]]-decomposing bacteria, and culture methods for soil microorganisms. Winogradsky retired from active life in 1940 and died in Brie-Comte-Robert in 1953.

==Discoveries==
Winogradsky discovered various [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and parts of these cycles. These discoveries include
* His work on [[sulfur cycle|bacterial sulfate reduction]] for which he first became renowned, including the first known form of [[lithotrophy]] (in [[Beggiatoa]]).
* His work on the [[Nitrogen cycle]] including
** The identification of the [[obligate anaerobe]] ''[[Clostridium|Clostridium pasteurianum]]'' is a free living microbe capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen and not living in [[legume]] [[root nodule]]s.
** Chemosynthesis – his most noted discovery
** The [[Winogradsky column]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ogunseitan |first1= Oladele | title= Microbial Diversity: Form and Function in Prokaryotes| year= 2005 | edition=1st |publisher= Wiley| url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405144483.html| isbn= 978-1-4051-4448-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nitrogen Cycle.svg|thumb|350px|[[Nitrogen cycle]]]]

===Chemosynthesis===
Winogradsky is best known for discovering chemoautotrophy, which soon became popularly known as [[chemosynthesis]], the process by which organisms derive energy from a number of different [[inorganic compound]]s and obtain [[carbon]] in the form of [[carbon dioxide]]. Previously, it was believed that autotrophs obtained their energy solely from [[light]], not from reactions of inorganic compounds.  With the discovery of organisms that oxidized inorganic compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonium as energy sources, autotrophs could be divided into two groups: [[phototroph|photoautotrophs]] and chemoautotrophs.  Winogradsky was one of the first researchers to attempt to understand [[microorganisms]] outside of the medical context, making him among the first students of [[microbial ecology]] and [[environmental microbiology]].

The [[Winogradsky column]] remains an important display of chemoautotrophy and microbial ecology, demonstrated in microbiology lectures around the world.&lt;ref name="brock"&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:Syntagma01.png|right|thumb|300px]]
'''''Syntagma Musicum''''' is a book by the German musicologist [[Michael Praetorius]], published in [[Wittenberg]] and [[Wolfenbüttel]] in three parts between 1614 and 1620. It is one of the most commonly used research sources for the music theory of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Herbert2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herbert|first=Trevor|title=The Trombone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wy8bhvi2-j8C&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=28 March 2006|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-10095-2|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second work ''De Organographia'' illustrates and describes musical instruments and their use; becoming a valuable resource for the research and reconstruction of early instruments.

The three volumes (a fourth was in progress but never published) were:
* I: ''Musicae Artis Analecta''
* II: ''De Organographia''
* III: ''Termini musici''

WISDP is initiated and supported by advocates of UN Agenda 2030 and the 17 SDGs. They include UNESCO Hong Kong Association, UNESCO Office of Pacific States, UNESCO Chair in the Political Economy of Education]], the UNESCO Chair in [[TVET]] &amp; [[Lifelong Learning]], Members of Working Groups of UNPRME (UN [[Principles for Responsibility of Management Education), Members of UN Global Compact, and Members of UNOSSCO (UN Organization of South-South Cooperation).

== History ==
UNESCO Hong Kong Association (UNESCO HK)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.hk/index.php?charset=eng|title=UNESCO Hong Kong Association|website=www.unesco.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; is dedicated to facilitating and achieving UNESCO's mission, creating conditions for dialogue among [[civilizations]], cultures and peoples based upon respect for commonly shared values. It is through this dialogue that the world can achieve global visions of [[sustainable development]] encompassing observance of human rights, mutual respect and the alleviation of poverty. It strives to work towards the building of peace and to facilitate the sustainable development of society, economy and environment through education, sciences and culture.

The United Nation 2030 Agenda &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld/publication|title=Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development|author=|date=|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Sustainable Development was formed by 2015 and established 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (17 SDGs) and 169 work targets &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|author=|date=|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to push the sustainable development for year 2030 worldwide. To push and support the sustainable development of United Nations, a partner of UNESCO HK, WISDP was established in October, 2017 to cooperate with UNESCO HK to push and facilitate the development, planning and implementation of 17 SDGs. WISDP is a worldwide study and [[research institute]] to drive the training and professional recognition of sustainable development to industries, business, education and public service.

WISDP was registered in Hong Kong with the company name, WORLD INSTITUTE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PLANNERS LIMITED and was incorporated on 12-OCT-2017 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hkcompa.com/ny|title=- Hong Kong Business Directory|author=|date=|website=Hong Kong Business Directory|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[company limited by guarantee]]. WISDP was formally launched in February 2018 and partner with training institutes to provide different levels of sustainable development training to industries and business. WISDP also establish memberships and certification processes to recognize the training, experiences and contributions of sustainable development for individuals and organizations.

==Learned Society of Sustainable Development==
United Nations established the training and initiatives of sustainable development to keep the sustainability of the earth as well as the human development. Sustainable development implies economic growth together with the protection of environmental quality and social situation, each reinforcing the other. It is crucial to harmonize three core elements: economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. The earth is the home of human being and we need to protect make the sustainability of the earth through sustainable development culture and planning.

WISDP is a [[Learned Society]] fostering and advocating UN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] in accordance with the three components &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thwink.org/sustain/glossary/ThreePillarsOfSustainability.htm|title=The Three Pillars of Sustainability|author=|date=|website=www.thwink.org|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Environment, Society and Economy. Training is provided for professionals according to their needs and successful trainees are awarded professional membership from WISDP and UNESCO HK Association, and subject to adequate relevant work experience, they are entitled to become Certified Sustainable Development Planners (CSDP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisdp.org.hk/cert_csdp.htm|title=WISDP - Menu|author=|date=|website=www.wisdp.org.hk|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opportunities are provided for awardees to apply for Fellowship status after a number of years of [[continuing professional development]] (CPD).

In 2018, WISDP Divisions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisdp.org.hk/division.htm|title=WISDP - Menu|author=|date=|website=www.wisdp.org.hk|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  launched training programmes and lead to professional memberships. The training programmes incLuded Corporate Social responsibility (CSR), Sustainable Finance and Investment, Health Society and [[Wellness (medicine)|Wellness]], Early Childhood Education, Sustainability in Engineering and sustainable development in Insurance.

==Promotion and Recognition of Sustainable Development==
WISDP partnered with universities, training institutes and professional bodies to promote and develop sustainable development planning knowledge to business sector, industries and education. The study levels includes diploma, certificate and continuing professional development training.

WISDP also push and promote sustainable development to business organizations. WISDP support corporations to promote and implement sustainable leadership, processes, products, services as well as business strategies. Corporations may join the WISDP membership to cooperate with their sustainable development programmes and WISDP will award to the corporations, which contributed sustainable development to the industries and society.

WISDP is set up as a professional organization and membership &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisdp.org.hk/type_membership.htm|title=WISDP - Menu|author=|date=|website=www.wisdp.org.hk|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for practising sustainable development planning. Principally individual who support and experienced sustainable development planners may join the membership. WISDP offer various categories of membership to recognize different levels of sustainable development. WISDP welcome to people who are not practising but are interested in the profession or students who aspire to join the profession in the future.
