{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}

'''Applied aesthetics''' is the application of the branch of philosophy of aesthetics to cultural constructs.
{{TOC right}}

==Architecture and interior design==

Although structural integrity, cost, the nature of building materials, and the functional utility of the building contribute heavily to the design process, architects can still apply aesthetic considerations to buildings and related [[architecture|architectural]] structures. Common aesthetic design principles include ornamentation, edge delineation, texture, flow, solemnity, symmetry, color, granularity, the interaction of sunlight and shadows, transcendence, and harmony.

[[Interior design]]ers, being less constrained by structural concerns, have a wider variety of applications to appeal to aesthetics. They may employ color, color harmony, wallpaper, ornamentation, furnishings, fabrics, textures, lighting, various floor treatments, as well as adhere to aesthetic concepts such as [[feng shui]].

==Digital art==

A new art form struggling for acceptance is [[digital art]], a by-product of computer programming that raises new questions about what truly constitutes art.  Although paralleling many of the aesthetics in traditional media, digital art can additionally draw upon the aesthetic qualities of cross-media tactile relationships; interactivity; autonomous generativity; complexity and interdependence of relationships; suspense; and playfulness.

Artists working in this type of art are often forced to justify their use of a computer rather than a traditional medium, leading to, like the debate over Warhol's "Brillo Pad Boxes", a question of what constitutes art.

The criticisms of digital art are many. For example, graphics programs allow perfect shading to be achieved with little to no effort. In other types of programs, there is a sense that because of the variety of tools, filters, distortions, etc., that an artist has a veritable image factory at their disposal. The various criticisms ultimately come down to the issue of "what effort is the artist putting into their work?"

The 3d art community frequently references that while the programs they utilize render and shade the objects, their efforts are more akin to the sculptor or architect, presenting an aesthetically arranged, lighted, and textured scene. The users of the other programs such as Photoshop or Gimp point out that while they may have many tools at their disposal, the art itself must be that much more detailed and imaginative to stand out. In both cases there is the challenge of overcoming the barriers of limited technology and the lack of direct contact with one's medium.

==Education and social sciences==

Educators are also interested in how aesthetic designs influence the ways that students think and learn. Some historical figures like [[John Dewey]] have approached education through aesthetics. More recently, Elliot Eisner and jan jagodzinski have reopened the debate. Other researchers with [[postmodern]] or [[poststructural]] influences have done the same, these include Cleo H. Cherryholmes and [[Michel Foucault]]. Aesthetics in education has been linked to [[pragmatism]] as well as other areas of curriculum development and implementation.

See ''Understanding Curriculum," Chapter 11, Understanding Curriculum as Aesthetic Text, by William F. Pinar, William M. Reynolds, Patrick Slattery and Peter Taubman (1995) for more information.

==Fashion design==

[[Fashion design]]ers use a variety of techniques to allow people to express the truth about their unconscious minds by way of their clothing. To create wearable personality designers use fabric, cut, colour, scale, references to the past, texture, color harmony, distressing, transparency, insignia, accessories, beading and embroidery.
It is also used to find the average size of things, to make a product suitable for a high number of customers.

==Film, television, and video==

[[Film]] combines many diverse disciplines, each of which may have their own rules of aesthetics. The aesthetics of [[cinematography]] are closely related to still [[photography]], but the movement of the subject(s), or the camera and the intensities, colors, and placement of the [[lighting]] are highly important. [[Sound recording]], editing, and mixing are other, highly important areas of film, often closely related with the [[Film score|musical score]]. As in [[Theatre]], [[art direction]], in the design of the sets and shooting locations also applies, as well as [[costume design]] and [[makeup]]. All of these disciplines are closely inter-twined and must be brought together by the aesthetic sensibilities of the [[Film director|director]].

[[Montage sequence|Montage]], or editing is probably the one discipline unique to film, video, and television. The timing, rhythm and progression of shots form the ultimate composition of the film. This procedure is one of the most critical element of [[post production]], and incorporates sound editing and mixing, as well as the design and execution of digital [[special effects]].

In the case of a [[video installation]], the method of presentation becomes critical. The work may be screened on a simple [[video monitor|monitor]], projected on a wall or other surface, or incorporated into a larger sculptural installation. A video installation may also involve sound, with similar considerations to be made based on speaker design and placement, volume, and tone.

==Gastronomy==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2007}}
{{Original research|section|date=December 2007}}
Although [[culinary|food]] is a basic and frequently experienced commodity, careful attention to the aesthetic possibilities of foodstuffs can turn eating into [[gastronomy]]. Chefs inspire our aesthetic enjoyment through the visual sense using colour and arrangement; they inspire our senses of taste and smell using [[spices]], diversity/contrast, anticipation, seduction, and decoration/garnishes. In regard to [[drinking water]], there are formal criteria for aesthetic value including [[odour]], [[colour]], [[total dissolved solids]] and clarity. There are numerical standards in the [[United States|U.S.]] for aesthetic acceptability of these parameters.

Note, however, a use of a word translated to "culinary" in Adorno's aesthetics. Adorno distinguishes between technically accurate and "beautiful" musical interpretation, and an interpretation higher which brings out the "truth" in the musical text: interpretations more rehearsed, with more time for rehearsal, but which might sound strange to audiences pandered-to by popular conductors (perhaps in the way Glenn Gould enstranges the music of Beethoven).

Unfortunately for the ordinary reader of Adorno, this isn't something technical such as "original instruments". It is instead the work of art that doesn't pander to what the audience "wants"...its whims.

This is linked to a Marxist interpretation which instead of treating the audience as an all-powerful "customer" adopts a teacherly or even priestly stance "above" the mere audience, something only the most "snobbish" of French chefs would dare, proposing to teach it to like Higher Things.

There are rarefied forms of *haute* cuisine; but note that common sense usually has a horselaugh about precious Yuppies eating designer food which it withholds about concert-goers listening to Berg; your man in the street merely thinks the latter crowd to be odd jobs, and doesn't resent them, meaning that ethical judgements play a role in aesthetic judgements that specialists in ethics, and specialists in aesthetics, systematically disregard...but which artists such as Tolstoy regarded as central.

Based on Adorno's theory of the (merely) culinary as not being "art", this would seem to mean that it is a joke, for an Adornoite (if such a person exists meaningfully), to treat cooking as an art form or eating as art appreciation.

Monty Python would often reverberate with this sort of arcana in a strange way: in the Mr. Creosote passage of The Meaning of Life, an enormously fat man is persuaded by the fawning waiter to have one more sweet whereupon Mr. Creosote throws up all over the dining room. Note that the scene has more claims to be art, despite being nauseating, than designer food.

This MAY be an unconscious comment on any theory of art that blindly equates "fine dining" and a visit to the picture galleries, a sort of tourist equation in which picture galleries are overrun in fact by post-prandial Mr. Creosotes. Even the ordinary man in the street would say that the starving artist visiting the gallery has a "better" apprehension of the higher, more inner, more elusive aura of the art work than Mr. Creosote, which means that for some authors, including Adorno, there is a nexus between ethics (which nearly tracks aesthetics polyphonically, where we use "good" and "bad" in ethics to characterise people and their deeds, and in aesthetics to judge what to buy).

The possibility of a rejection of the culinary in art starts with Kant's theory of the sublime but does not end there; post Holocaust (with its Nazis playing Bach: with Adorno's questions about poetry after Auschwitz) the culinary, and whether the German officer enjoying a "fine" meal has much of anything to do with art, become important aesthetic questions.

A Marxist theory of art would probably conclude that the chef cannot be an artist, lacking autonomy and beholden to the customer, Mr. Creosote, in all regards.

==Humor==

{{Further|Humor|Jokes|Mathematical humor}}
There is a developed theory of the aesthetics of jokes and humor, including a mathematical and logical analysis.

==Industrial design==

[[Industrial Design]]: Designers need many aesthetic qualities to improve the marketability of manufactured products: smoothness, shininess/reflectivity, texture, pattern, curviness, color, simplicity, usability, velocity, symmetry, naturalness, and modernism.
The staff of the Design Aesthetics section focuses on design, appearance and the way people perceive products. Design aesthetics is interested in the appearance of products; the explanation and meaning of this appearance is studied mainly in terms of social and cultural factors. The distinctive focus of the section is research and education in the field of sensory modalities in relation to product design. These fields of attention generate design baggage that enables engineers to design products, systems, and services, and match them to the correct field of use.

==Information technology==

Aesthetics in [[information technology]] has focused upon the study of [[human-computer interaction]] and creating [[user-friendly]] devices and [[software applications]]. [[Software]] itself has aesthetic dimensions ("[[software aesthetics]]"), as do information-technology-mediated processes and experiences such as computer [[video games]] and [[virtual reality]] simulations. [[Digital culture]] is a distinct aesthetic to judge the appeal of digital environments such as [[Web browser]]s, [[website]]s, and icons, as well as visual and aural art produced exclusively with digital technologies. The notion of [[cyberspace]] has sometimes been linked to the concept of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].

Aesthetics in information technology do also apply to the act of designing [[software]] itself. Numerous [[programmers]] profess to experiencing a dimension of [[elegance]] in the functionality and structuring of software at the [[source code]] level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/front/node3.html Preface to the First Edition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a short, powerful expression that clearly expresses the intent of the code can be considered "beautiful" to the poor programmer charged with maintaining said code. This contrasts with code that is (as code all too often is) short, cryptic, unclear, and unnecessarily "clever". In-line documentation, while not strictly code, can be considered something a programmer would need to be good at in order to write beautiful code. Correctly done, documentation can accentuate the effect of beautiful code, when it is clear, concise, explains the intent of the programmer, and expands the understanding that one can gain by simply looking at the code. Comments that are redundant (only explain what the code already explains), cryptic, and overly long or short can detract from beautiful code. Aesthetics in programming can also have a practical level: Under the right conditions, elegant code can run faster and more efficiently, and (most importantly) be less prone to errors.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Knuth,  "Literate Programming", http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this would say that the need to justify "good design" by reference to "cost savings" means that "good design" isn't "art" insofar as art is autonomous, and many aestheticians would have to say that art emerges in applications only in excess of cost savings. In information technology, theorists of "user friendliness" have to justify their "user friendly" applications and often disregard basic statistics when most users like a system, but a significant minority hate it.

That is, they may discard the standard deviation of their data in order to sell a good design for the best price, and this has nothing to do with art insofar as art is a useful signifier (if you cost-justify everything you are a businessman and not an artist).

A folk phenomenon among real programmers is in fact their frequent hatred of practice described in books as best practice and good design. A Marxist theory of industrial "art" would ascribe this to alienation, in which subaltern programmers never produce code they own in any meaningful sense, with the problem that the same sort of alienation, soldiering, and bloody-mindedness appeared, it seems, in Soviet computing shops.

The most sophisticated writings on the topic of aesthetics are to be found in the late [[Edsger Dijkstra|Edsger Wybe Dijkstra's]] corpus of papers and notes on computing: in Dijkstra, the art is real, but Ying with respect to the Yang of applications; Dijkstra seemed to have refused any analysis of programming as other than applied mathematics and, strange to say, never pursued what Adorno (the midcentury theoretician of whom Dijkstra was apparently unaware) called a purely culinary elegance...despite the protests of others that his work was "hard to digest", in Adorno's words not very culinary.

Dijkstra's beauty refused the notion of accessibility as do many "artistic" works ancient and modern: it was hard as is the Grosse Fuge, Beethoven's syncopated and neo-primitive late movement. In fact, no aesthetician makes "user friendliness" canonical and necessary in a work of art, strange to say in an era when supposedly the masses rule through the market; for most art theorists, it is nice if the canaille can enjoy some pretty rondo of Mozart and whistle it on the street, but would deny that this property must be shared by the Masonic prelude and fugue or the Requiem mass.

This makes strange any claim that a programmer making his work "user friendly" to all comers is some sort of artist by virtue of that. For Dijsktra, truth was primary, and beauty the automatic result.

==Landscape design==

[[Landscape architecture|Landscape designers]] draw upon design elements such as axis, line, landform, horizontal and vertical planes, texture, and scale to create aesthetic variation within the landscape. They may additionally make use of aesthetic elements such as pools or fountains of water, plants, seasonal variance, stonework, fragrance, exterior lighting, statues, and lawns.

==Literature==

{{main|Literary merit}}
In [[poetry]], [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s and [[non-fiction]], authors use a variety of techniques to appeal to our aesthetic values. Depending on the type of writing an author may employ rhythm, illustrations, structure, time shifting, juxtaposition, dualism, imagery, fantasy, suspense, analysis, humor/cynicism, and thinking aloud.

==Maps==

Aesthetics in [[cartography]] relates to the visual experience of map reading and can take two forms: responses to the map itself as an aesthetic object (e.g., through detail, colour, and form) and also the subject of the map symbolised, often the landscape (e.g., a particular expression of terrain which forms an imagined visual experience of the aesthetic).

Cartographers make aesthetic judgments when designing maps to ensure that the content forms a clear expression of the theme(s). Antique maps are perhaps especially revered due to their aesthetic value, which may seem to be derived from their styles of ornamentation. As such, aesthetics are often wrongly considered to be a by-product of design. If it is taken that aesthetic judgments are produced within a certain social context, they are fundamental to the cartographer's symbolisation and as such are integral to the function of maps.

==Marketing==

As opposed to Industrial Design, which focuses on the aesthetic qualities of consumer products (see below), the use of aesthetics in marketing concerns itself with the "trade dress" of a product, such as its branding, its commercial representation, or the reputation of its producer. Marketing professionals may tickle the consumer's aesthetic appreciation of sassyness, [[sophistication]], color-harmony, stylishness, catchy jingles, slogans, craftsmanship, soothingness, attentiveness, authenticity, or the related perceived experiences associated with product consumption.

Marketing consists of intriguing the human mind to think in a direction where it would not have done so previously - or not without outside input. Human curiosity, self gain or mental adjustment is what drives marketing development itself.

==Mathematics==

{{Main|Mathematical beauty}}
{{Further|mathematical humor}}
The aesthetics of [[mathematics]] are often compared with music and poetry. Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] expressed his views on the indescribable beauty of mathematics when he said "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful." Math appeals to the "senses" of logic, order, novelty, elegance, and discovery. Some concepts in math with specific aesthetic application include sacred ratios in [[geometry]], the intuitiveness of axioms, the complexity and intrigue of fractals, the solidness and regularity of [[polyhedra]], and the [[serendipity]] of relating theorems across disciplines.  There is a developed aesthetic and theory of humor in [[mathematical humor]].

==Music==

{{main|Aesthetics of music}}
Some of the aesthetic elements expressed in [[music]] include lyricism, [[harmony]], hypnotism, emotiveness, temporal dynamics, volume dynamics, resonance, playfulness, color, subtlety, elatedness, depth, and mood (see [[musical development]]). Aesthetics in music are often believed to be highly sensitive to their context: what sounds good in modern [[rock music]] might sound terrible in the context of the early [[baroque music|baroque]] age.

==Neuroesthetics==

[[Cognitive science]] has also considered aesthetics, with the advent of [[neuroesthetics]], pioneered by [[Semir Zeki]], which seeks to explain the prominence of great art as an embodiment of biological principles of the brain, namely that great works of art capture the essence of things just as vision and the brain capture the essentials of the world from the ever-changing stream of sensory input. ''See also'' [[Vogelkop bowerbird]].

==Performing arts==

[[Theater|Performing arts]] appeal to our aesthetics of storytelling, grace, balance, class, timing, strength, shock, humor, costume, irony, beauty, drama, suspense, and sensuality. Whereas live stage performance is usually constrained by the physical reality at hand, film performance can further add the aesthetic elements of large-scale action, fantasy, and a complex interwoven musical [[film score|score]]. [[Performance art]] often consciously mixes the aesthetics of several forms. [[Role-playing games]] are sometimes seen as a performing art with an aesthetic structure of their own, called [[role-playing game theory|RPG theory]].

==Two-dimensional and plastic arts==

Aesthetic considerations within the [[visual arts]] are usually associated with the sense of [[visual perception|vision]]. A painting or sculpture, however, is also perceived spatially by recognized associations and context, and even to some extent by the senses of smell, hearing, and touch. The form of the work can be subject to an aesthetic as much as the content.

In painting, the aesthetic convention that we see a three-dimensional representation rather than a two-dimensional canvas is so well understood that most people do not realize that they are making an aesthetic interpretation. This notion is the basis of [[abstract impressionism]].

In the United States during the postwar period, the "push-pull" theories of [[Hans Hofmann]], positing a relation between color and perceived depth, strongly influenced a generation of prominent abstract painters, many of whom studied under Hofmann and were generally associated with [[abstract expressionism]]. Hofmann's general attitude toward abstraction as virtually a moral imperative for the serious painter was also extremely influential.

Some aesthetic effects available in visual arts include variation, juxtaposition, repetition, field effects, symmetry/asymmetry, perceived mass, subliminal structure, linear dynamics, tension and repose, pattern, contrast, perspective, 3 dimensionality, movement, rhythm, unity/Gestalt, matrixiality and proportion.

==Urban life==

[[Image:Clifton suspension bridge from hotwells 600.jpg|thumb|300px|Towns and cities have been planned with aesthetics in mind; here in [[Bristol]] (England), 19th century private sector development was designed to appear attractive.]]
Over half of mankind lives in cities; although it represents a lofty goal, [[urban planning|planning]] and achieving urban aesthetics ([[beautification]]) involves a good deal of historical luck, happenstance, and indirect gestalt. Nevertheless, aesthetically pleasing cities share certain traits: ethnic and cultural variety, numerous microclimates that promote a diversity of vegetation, sufficient public transportation, Public art and freedom of expression in the community in the forms of sculpture, [[graffiti]] and [[street art]], a range of build-out (or zoning) that creates both densely and sparsely populated areas, scenic neighboring geography (oceans or mountains), public spaces and events such as [[park]]s and [[parade]]s, musical variety through local radio or street musicians, and enforcement of laws that abate noise, crime, and pollution.

==Website Design==

Recent research suggests that the visual aesthetics of computer interface is a strong determinant of users’ satisfaction and pleasure. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses found that users’ perceptions consist of different main dimensions. Lavie and Tractinsky found two main dimension which they termed  “classical aesthetics”  and “expressive aesthetics”.&lt;ref&gt;Lavie, T., &amp; Tractinsky, N. (2004). Assessing Dimensions of Perceived Visual Aesthetics of Websites. International Journal of Human Computer Studies , 269-298.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''Classical Aesthetics'' - pertains to aesthetic notions that presided from antiquity until the 18th century. These notions emphasize orderly and clear design and are closely related to many of the 	design rules advocated by usability experts.
*''Expressive Aesthetics'' - created by the designers’ creativity and originality and by the ability to break design conventions.
While both dimensions of perceived aesthetic are drawn from a pool of aesthetic judgments, they are clearly distinguishable from each other. &lt;br /&gt;
In a recent study Moshagen and Thielsch found four core dimensions of website aesthetics:&lt;ref&gt;Moshagen, M. &amp; Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', 68 (10), 689-709.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Simplicity
* Diversity
* Colors
* Craftsmanship

Simplicity and diversity have repeatedly been treated as formal parameters of aesthetic objects throughout the history of empirical aesthetics. Colors are a very critical property of aesthetic objects. Craftsmanship addresses the skillful and coherent integration of the relevant design dimensions. While simplicity is highly correlated to classical aesthetics as mentioned by Lavie and Tractinsky, the other three factors could be treated as deeper differentiation of expressive aesthetics.

&lt;br /&gt;
'''Best practices for aesthetic Website Design'''&lt;br /&gt;
•	Create visual clues based on groupings; related items or links are grouped together while unrelated items are separated.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use headings and subheadings to allow visual scanning of content.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use headings, subheadings, font sizes, bold fonts and italic fonts in proportion to the importance of the item.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Align elements on a page so that they are all visually connected; size all elements on the page to create balance and unity; nothing should look out of place unless you have a specific reason for the effect.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Choose a font style that supports the site atmosphere and stick to it; limit styles to 2 at the most.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use images and photos for visual appeal and to communicate ideas.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use one set of design elements across your website.

'''Website Design Aesthetics and Credibility''' &lt;br /&gt;
Website design influences user’s perception of site credibility. One of the factors that influences whether users stay or go on a web page is the page aesthetics. Another reason may involve a user's judgment about the site's credibility. Findings indicate that when the same content is presented using different levels of aesthetic treatment, the content with a higher aesthetic treatment was judged as having higher credibility. We call this the amelioration effect of visual design and aesthetics on content credibility. Holmes suggests that this effect is operational within the first few seconds in which a user views a web page. Given the same content, a higher aesthetic treatment will increase perceived credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, J., &amp; Robins, D. (2008). Aesthetics and Credibility in Web Site Design. Information Processing and Management: an International Journal , 386-399.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{good article}}
[[File:Beowulf_The_Monsters_and_the_Critics_1936_title_page.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of ''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics, 1936]]
"'''''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics'''" was a 1936 lecture given by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] on [[literary criticism]] on the [[Old English language|Old English]] [[hero]]ic [[epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]''. It was first published as a paper in that year in the ''[[Proceedings of the British Academy]]'', and has since been reprinted in many collections.

Tolkien argues that the original poem has almost been lost under the weight of the scholarship on it; that ''Beowulf'' must be seen as a poem, not just as a historical document; and that the quality of its verse and its structure give it a powerful effect. He rebuts suggestions that the poem is an epic or exciting narrative, likening it instead to a strong masonry structure built of blocks that fit together. He points out that the poem's theme is a serious one, mortality, and that the poem is in two parts: the first on Beowulf as a young man, defeating [[Grendel]] and his mother; the second on Beowulf in old age, going to his death fighting the dragon.

The work has been praised by critics including the poet and ''Beowulf'' translator [[Seamus Heaney]]. [[Michael D. C. Drout]] called it the most important article ever written about the poem.&lt;ref name="Drout2007"/&gt; Scholars of Anglo-Saxon agree that the work was influential, transforming the study of ''Beowulf''.

==Overview==

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s essay "''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics", initially delivered as a lecture in 1936, is regarded as a formative work in modern ''[[Beowulf]]'' studies.&lt;ref name=Niles&gt;{{cite book|last1=Niles| author-link=John Niles (scholar)|first1=John D.|editor1-last=Bjork|editor1-first=Robert E.|editor2-last=Niles|editor2-first=John D.|article=''Beowulf'', Truth, and Meaning|title=A ''Beowulf'' Handbook|date=1998|publisher=U of Nebraska P|location=Lincoln, NE|isbn=0-8032-6150-0|page=5|quote=Bypassing earlier scholarship, critics of the past fifty years have generally traced the current era of ''Beowulf'' studies back to 1936 [and Tolkien's essay].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shippey&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shippey |first1=Thomas A. |author-link=Tom Shippey |editor1-last=Bjork |editor1-first=Robert E. |editor2-last=Niles |editor2-first=John D. |article=Structure and Unity |title=A ''Beowulf'' Handbook |date=1998  |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, NE |isbn=0-8032-6150-0 |page=163 |quote=[Tolkien's essay] was seized upon eagerly, even gratefully, by generations of critics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Le |first1=Alvin A. |editor1-last=Bjork |editor1-first=Robert E.|editor2-last=Niles |editor2-first=John D. |article=Symbolism and Allegory |title=A ''Beowulf'' Handbook |date=1998 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |isbn=0-8032-6150-0 |page=240 |quote=Tolkien's manifesto and interpretation have had more influence on readers than any other single study, even thought it has been challenged on just about every one of its major points.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lerer&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lerer |first1=Seth |author-link=Seth Lerer |editor1-last=Bjork |editor1-first=Robert E.|editor2-last=Niles |editor2-first=John D. |article=''Beowulf'' and Contemporary Critical Theory |title=A ''Beowulf'' Handbook |date=1998 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, Nebraska |isbn=0-8032-6150-0 |pages=328,330 |quote=[Tolkien's essay] may well be the originary piece of modern ''Beowulf'' criticism. . . .

Tolkien argues that rather than being merely extraneous, these elements are key to the [[narrative]] and should be the focus of study. In doing so he drew attention to the previously neglected [[Literature|literary]] qualities of the poem and argued that it should be studied as a [[work of art]], not just as a [[historical document]].&lt;ref name=Acocella/&gt; Later critics such as Hugh Magennis who agree with Tolkien on this point have cited him to defend their arguments.&lt;ref name=Magennis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Magennis |first1=Hugh| title=Translating Beowulf: Modern Versions in English Verse |pages=6, 15-17 |date=2011| publisher=D.S.Brewer |isbn=978-1843842613| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1BZss2TtTisC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay is a redacted version of a [[lecture series|series of lectures]] that Tolkien delivered to Oxford undergraduates in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Sharp&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sharp |first1=Tom |title=J. R. R. Tolkien, Beowulf and the Critics. Ed. Michael D. C. Drout (Review) |url=http://www.sfsu.edu/~medieval/Volume5/Beowulf.html |publisher=San Francisco State University |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notes for these lectures exist in two [[manuscript]] versions published together in 2002 as ''[[Beowulf and the Critics]]'', edited by [[Michael D. C. Drout]]; these offer some insight into the development of Tolkien's thinking on the poem, especially his much-quoted metaphor of the material of the poem as a tower.&lt;ref name=Sharp/&gt; "''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics" is available in various collections including the 1983 ''[[The Monsters and the Critics|The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays]]'' edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]].

==Tolkien's argument==
===Rebuttal of earlier critics===
[[File:William_Paton_Ker_by_Johnstone_Forbes-Robertson_Univ_Glasgow_Hunterian_Art_Gallery.jpg|thumb|upright|Tolkien's essay repeatedly responds to comments by [[William Paton Ker]]. Late 19th century portrait by [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson]]]]
Tolkien begins by noting that the original book has almost been lost under the extensive "&amp;#x202f;‘literature’&amp;#x202f;"&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [his inverted commas] on the subject. He explains that ''Beowulf'' had mainly been quarried as "an historical document",&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and that most of the praise and censure of the poem was due to beliefs that it was "something that it was ''not'' – for example, primitive, pagan, Teutonic, an allegory (political or mythical), or most often, an epic;"&lt;ref name=T7&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; or because the scholar would have liked it to be something else, such as "a heathen heroic [[Lai (poetic form)|lay]], a history of Sweden, a manual of Germanic antiquities, or a Nordic ''[[Summa Theologica]]''."&lt;ref name=T7/&gt; Tolkien gives an allegory of a man who inherits a field full of stone from an old hall. He builds a tower with some of it, but when people find the stones are older than the tower, they pull it down "to look for hidden carvings and inscriptions".&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien quotes at length what the scholar [[W. P. Ker]] thought of ''Beowulf'', namely that "there is nothing much in the story", and that "the great beauty, the real value, of ''Beowulf'' is in its dignity of style". Tolkien notes that Ker's opinion had been a powerful influence in favour of a paradoxical contrast between the poem's supposed defect in speaking of monsters, and (in Tolkien's words) its agreed "dignity, loftiness in converse, and well-wrought finish".&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien cites other critics, such as [[Raymond Wilson Chambers]] and [[Ritchie Girvan]], who objected to the poem's "wilderness of dragons" and its unworthy choice of theme. Tolkien finds it improbable that "a mind lofty and thoughtful", as evidenced by the quality of the poetry, "would write more than three thousand lines (wrought to a high finish) on matter that is really not worth serious attention".&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that heroic human stories had been held to be superior to myth, but argues that myth has a special value: "For myth is alive at once and in all its parts, and dies before it can be dissected."&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally Tolkien states directly "We do not deny the worth of the hero by accepting Grendel and the dragon."&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Man in a hostile world===
In Tolkien's view, the poem is essentially about a "man at war with the hostile world, and his inevitable overthrow in Time". The underlying tragedy is man's brief mortal life. [[Grendel]] and the dragon are identified as enemies of a Christian God, unlike the monsters encountered by [[Odysseus]] on his travels.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt; What had happened is that Northern courage, exultant, defiant in the face of inevitable defeat by "Chaos and Unreason" (Tolkien cites Ker's words), fuses with a Christian faith and outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Beowulf'' poet uses both what he knew to be the old heroic tradition, darkened by distance in time, along with the newly acquired Christian tradition. The Christian, Tolkien notes, is "hemmed in a hostile world", and the monsters are evil spirits: but as the transition was incomplete in the poem, the monsters remain real and the focus remains "an ancient theme: that man, each man and all men, and all their works shall die".&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolkien returns to the monsters, and regrets we know so little about pre-Christian [[English mythology]]; he resorts instead to [[Elder Edda|Icelandic myth]], which he argues must have had a similar attitude to monsters, men and gods. The Northern gods, like men, are doomed to die. The Southern ([[Ancient Roman religion|Roman]] and [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek]]) pagan gods were immortal, so to Tolkien (a Christian), the Southern religion "must go forward to philosophy or relapse into anarchy":&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; death and the monsters are peripheral. But the Northern myths, and ''Beowulf'', put the monsters, mortality and death in the centre. Tolkien is therefore very interested in the contact of Northern and Christian thought in the poem, where the scriptural [[Cain]] is linked to ''eotenas'' (giants) and ''ylfe'' (elves), not through confusion but "an indication of the precise point at which an imagination, pondering old and new, was kindled".&lt;ref name=T26&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem is, Tolkien states, "an historical poem about the pagan past, or an attempt at one", obviously not with modern ideas of "literal historical fidelity".&lt;ref name=T26/&gt; The poet takes an old plot (a marauding monster troubling the [[Scylding]] court) paints a vivid picture of the old days, for instance using the [[Old Testament]] image of the shepherd [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs of Israel]] in the ''folces hyrde'' (people's shepherd) of the Danes.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure: youth versus age===
{{further|On Translating Beowulf}}
[[File:Beowulf Cotton MS Vitellius A XV f. 132r.jpg|thumb|upright|First folio of the ''Beowulf'' manuscript, c. 975-1025]]

The general structure of the poem is then clear, writes Tolkien. "It is essentially a balance, an opposition of ends and beginnings. In its simplest terms it is a contrasted description of two moments in a great life, rising and setting; an elaboration of the ancient and intensely moving contrast between youth and age, first achievement and final death."&lt;ref name=T28&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Part A (youth) is lines 1 to 2199; part B (age) is lines 2200 to 3182 (the end).&lt;ref name=T28/&gt;

A secondary division of the poem occurs, Tolkien writes, at line 1887, after which all the earlier story is summarized, so a complete account of Beowulf's tragedy is given between 1888 and the end, but without the account of the gloomy court of [[Heorot]], or of the contrast between the young Beowulf and the old [[Hrothgar]].

The poem's metre, too, is founded on a balance of two halves to each line, "more like masonry than music".&lt;ref name=T30&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien argues that the poem is not meant to be an exciting narrative, nor a romantic story, but a word-picture, "a method and structure that ... approaches rather to sculpture or painting. It is a composition not a tune."&lt;ref name=T30/&gt; Far from being weakly structured, it "is curiously strong".&lt;ref name=T30/&gt; It

{{quote|is not an '[[epic poetry|epic]]', nor even a magnified '[[Lai (poetic form)|lay]]'. No terms borrowed from Greek or other literatures exactly fit: there is no reason why they should. Though if we must have a term, we should choose rather '[[elegy]]'. It is an heroic-elegiac poem; and in a sense all its first 3,136 lines are the prelude to a [[dirge]].&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===A singular effect===

Tolkien takes a moment to dismiss another criticism, that monsters should not have been made to appear in both halves. He replies he can see the point of no monsters, but not in complaining about their mere numbers; the poet could not, he argues, have balanced Beowulf's rise to fame through a war in [[Frisia]], against death by dragon. Similarly, he dismisses notions that the poem is primitive: it is instead a late poem, using materials left over from a vanished age:

{{quote|When new ''Beowulf'' was already antiquarian, in a good sense, and it now produces a singular effect. For it is now to us itself ancient; and yet its maker was telling of things already old and weighted with regret, and he expended his art in making keen that touch upon the heart which sorrows have that are both poignant and remote. If the funeral of Beowulf moved once like the echo of an ancient dirge, far-off and hopeless, it is to us as a memory brought over the hills, an echo of an echo. There is not much poetry in the world like this;&lt;ref name=T33&gt;Tolkien 1997, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tolkien finishes by arguing that ''Beowulf'' "has its own individual character, and peculiar solemnity;"&lt;ref name=T33/&gt; and would still be powerful even if it came from some unknown time and place; but that in fact its language, [[Old English]],

{{quote|has still essential kinship with our own, it was made in this land, and moves in our northern world beneath our northern sky, and for those who are native to that tongue and land, it must ever call with a profound appeal – until the dragon comes.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien 1997, pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reception==

===Scholars===

Scholars and critics agree on the work's wide influence. [[Tom Shippey]] wrote that the essay "was seized upon eagerly, even gratefully, by generations of critics".&lt;ref name=Shippey/&gt; [[Alvin A. Lee]] wrote that "Tolkien's manifesto and interpretation have had more influence on readers than any other single study, even though it has been challenged on just about every one of its major points."&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt; [[Seth Lerer]] wrote that the essay "may well be the originary piece of modern ''Beowulf'' criticism. … The strategies … control the fundamental assumptions of Old English scholarship for the next fifty years."&lt;ref name=Lerer/&gt; R.D. Fulk commented that "No one denies the historical importance of this lecture. … opening the way to the formalist principles that played such a vital role in the subsequent development of further ''Beowulf'' scholarship. … the methodology … remains a model for emulation.".&lt;ref name=Fulk/&gt; [[Bruce Mitchell (scholar)|Bruce Mitchell]] and Fred C. Robinson call it in their ''Beowulf, An Edition'' (1998) "the most influential literary criticism of the poem ever written".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Bruce |last2=Robinson |first2=Fred C. |title=Beowulf: An Edition |date=1998 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-0631172260}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Clark calls it "The most influential critical essay on the poem", stating it without qualification or justification as a known fact.&lt;ref name="BjorkNiles1998"&gt;{{cite book |author=Clark, George  |title=The Hero and the Theme |editor1=Bjork, Robert E. |editor2=Niles, John D. |work=A Beowulf Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SaFdpGdjvtoC&amp;pg=PA279 |year=1998 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=0-8032-6150-0 |page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Lapidge]] similarly names it "his widely influential critical discussion of the poem".&lt;ref name="Lapidge1996"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Lapidge |author-link=Michael Lapidge |title=Anglo-Latin Literature, 600-899 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTWO1z2nO1wC&amp;pg=PA273 |date=January 1996 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-1-85285-011-1 |page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar and translator [[Roy Liuzza]] commented that Tolkien's essay "is usually credited with re-establishing the [[fable|fabulous]] elements and heroic combats at the center of the modern reader's appreciation of the poem." Liuzza at once went on to write, however, that "the separation of the poem into 'mythical' and 'historical' elements is a false dichotomy". He argues that if myth can condense and hold the deepest sources of tension between self and the social order, and dramatises current ideologies by projecting them into the past, then even the hero Beowulf's mythic fights are at the same time throwing light on society and history.&lt;ref name=Liuzza&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liuzza|first1=Roy|author-link=Roy Liuzza|title=Beowulf: Facing page translation|date=2013|publisher=Broadview|location=Ontario, Canada|isbn=978-1-55481-113-7|page=17|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Patrick Wormald]] wrote of the essay: "it would be no exaggeration to describe [it] as one of the most influential works of literary criticism of that century, and since which nothing in ''Beowulf'' studies has been quite the same."&lt;ref name="Wormald2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wormald, Patrick |title=Times of Bede: Studies in Early English Christian Society and its Historian |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KiS5C5PTVvkC&amp;pg=PA35 |date=15 April 2008 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-470-69265-3 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wormald continues: "The arguments of Tolkien's paper were not universally accepted, and some of its effects would perhaps have been disowned by the author, but its general impact could be summarized by saying that most critics have learnt to take the ''Beowulf'' poet a great deal more seriously".&lt;ref name="Wormald2008"/&gt; Wormald added that

{{quote|Tolkien argued powerfully that, for the Germanic mentality that gave birth to the myth of ''[[Ragnarök]]'', the monsters of the poem were the ''only'' appropriate enemies for a great hero, and thus shifted ''Beowulf''  from the irrelevant fringes to the very centre of the Anglo-Saxon thought world. This naturally encouraged a pre-existent tendency to square the poem with what else was known of the 'serious' levels of Anglo-Saxon thought - chiefly the Latin scholarship of the Church. Secondly, Tolkien went far towards vindicating the structure of the poem by arguing that it was a balance of contrasting and interlocking halves. His thesis not only convinced many critics but inspired them to follow his example, with the result that Tolkien's own position has been outflanked. Whereas previous generations of scholars, Tolkien included, had been quite prepared to explain what they considered structural and stylistic blemishes as interpolations, modern writers seek evidence of artistic refinement in some of the poem's least promising features.&lt;ref name="Wormald2008"/&gt;}}

[[Michael D. C. Drout]] similarly describes the essay's importance and arguments, writing that it

{{quote|is the most important article ever written about ''Beowulf'' … Tolkien's shadow looms long over ''Beowulf'' scholarship. Much of this influence is because of the enormous success of [the essay], which is viewed as the beginning of modern ''Beowulf'' criticism. … Tolkien was so influential ... because he developed a big-picture reading of the poem that has found favour with several generations of critics. … [He] made the first widely accepted case for viewing ''Beowulf'' as aesthetically successful, and he showed how the monsters in ''Beowulf'' were symbolic (not allegorical) representations of chaos and night, set in opposition to stability and civilization. … Thus, Tolkien interpreted the theme of ''Beowulf'' to be that "man, each man and all men and all their works shall die," a theme consistent with the heathen past but one that "no Christian need despise." It was this theme, Tolkien argued, that brought the great dignity to the poem that even scholars who had regretted the monsters had noted.&lt;ref name="Drout2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Drout, Michael D. C. |author-link=Michael D. C. Drout |work=J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment | title=''Beowulf'': Tolkien's Scholarship |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B0loOBA3ejIC&amp;pg=PA60 |year=2007 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-96942-0|pages=59-60}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Drout then remarks on the paradoxical success of the essay:

{{quote|The massive influence of "[[The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son|The Homecoming]]" and "''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics" is in some ways ironic. The great majority of Tolkien's work on ''Beowulf'' was of the sort represented by the textual commentry in ''[[Finn and Hengest]]''—detailed, philological, historical, and infinitely painstaking. Yet the most influential of Tolkien's discussions of the poem are those in which he makes the greatest unsupported (or lightly supported) generalizations and in which he discusses the poem in the broadest possible terms. Tolkien would perhaps have seen a fundamental continuity between the detailed and philological and the broader and more interpret[at]ive work, but because of the accidents of publication—and because of Tolkien's great gift for rhetoric—only the latter has shaped the field of ''Beowulf'' criticism.&lt;ref name="Drout2007"/&gt;}}

[[John Niles (scholar)|John D. Niles]] observed that "Bypassing earlier scholarship, critics of the past fifty years have generally traced the current era of ''Beowulf'' studies back to 1936",&lt;ref name=Niles/&gt; meaning to Tolkien's essay, which he called "eloquent and incisive".&lt;ref name=Niles/&gt; Niles argued that the essay quickly came to be a starting point, as scholars from then on assumed—with Tolkien—that the poem was "an aesthetic unity endowed with spiritual significance."&lt;ref name=Niles/&gt; In Niles's view, Tolkien thought that the battles with monsters and the sombre, elegiac tone of the poem expressed the "artistic designs of a deep thinker, religiously enlightened, who let his mind play over a lost heroic world of the imagination",&lt;ref name=Niles/&gt;  in other words that the ''Beowulf'' poet was a man much like Tolkien. Niles cited George Clark's observation that Tolkien left ''Beowulf'' scholars with the "myth of the poet as brooding intellectual, poised between a dying pagan world and a nascent Christian one."&lt;ref name=Niles/&gt; Niles noted that Tolkien's view of the melancholic vision of the ''Beowulf'' poet, and of the heroic fatalism of the poem's leading characters, was not wholly new, but that his view of the poet himself as a hero was.&lt;ref name=Niles/&gt;

===Press===

[[Joan Acocella]], writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', calls it "a paper that many people regard as not just the finest essay on the poem but one of the finest essays on English literature."&lt;ref name=Acocella&gt;{{cite web |last1=Acocella| first1=Joan |title=Slaying Monsters: Tolkien's Beowulf |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/02/slaying-monsters | publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=23 November 2014| date=2 June 2014 |authorlink=Joan Acocella |quote=In his view, the meaning of the poem had been ignored in favor of archeological and philological study.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She adds that "Tolkien preferred the monsters to the critics."&lt;ref name=Acocella/&gt;

[[Regina Weinreich]], reviewing ''The Monsters and the Critics: And Other Essays'' in ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that the title essay "revolutionized the study of the early English poem ''Beowulf,'' in which a young hero crushes a human-handed monster called Grendel. Against the scorn of critics, Tolkien defends the centrality and seriousness of literary monsters, declaring his own belief in the symbolic value of such preternatural representations of sheer evil."&lt;ref name=Weinreich&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weinreich |first1=Regina |title=In Short: THE MONSTERS AND THE CRITICS: And Other Essays.

John Garth, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', describes the paper as "still well worth reading, not only as an introduction to the poem, but also because it decisively changed the direction and emphasis of Beowulf scholarship. Up to that point it had been used as a quarry of linguistic, historical and archaeological detail".&lt;ref name=Garth&gt;{{cite web |last1=Garth |first1=John |title=JRR Tolkien's translation of Beowulf: bring on the monsters |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/22/jrr-tolkien-translation-beowulf-monsters |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=23 November 2014 |date=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garth notes that

{{quote|Tolkien pushed the monsters to the forefront. He argued that they represent the impermanence of human life, the mortal enemy that can strike at the heart of everything we hold dear, the force against which we need to muster all our strength – even if ultimately we may lose the fight. Without the monsters, the peculiarly northern courage of Beowulf and his men is meaningless. Tolkien, veteran of the Somme, knew that it was not.&lt;ref name=Garth/&gt;}}

===Translator===
[[File:Seamus Heaney Photograph Edit.jpg|thumb|upright|The poet and ''Beowulf'' translator [[Seamus Heaney]] praised ''The Monsters and the Critics''.]]

Tolkien's paper was praised by the Irish poet [[Seamus Heaney]] in the introduction to his critically acclaimed [[translation]] of ''Beowulf''. He wrote that the "epoch-making paper"&lt;ref name=Heaney&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heaney |first1=Seamus |title=Beowulf |date=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Faber and Faber |isbn=0-571-20376-0 |page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; stood out in considering ''Beowulf'' as literature. Heaney argued that Tolkien "took for granted the poem's integrity and distinction as a work of art",&lt;ref name=Heaney/&gt; and showed how the poem achieved that status:

{{quote|Tolkien assumed that the poet had felt his way through the inherited material - the fabulous elements and the traditional accounts of a heroic past - and by a combination of creative intuition and conscious structuring had arrived at a unity of effect and a balanced order. He assumed, in other words, that the ''Beowulf'' poet was an imaginative writer rather than some kind of back-formation derived from nineteenth-century [[folklore]] and [[philology]].&lt;ref name=Heaney/&gt;}}

Heaney called the paper's literary treatment  "brilliant".&lt;ref name=Heaney/&gt; He suggested that it had changed the way that ''Beowulf'' was valued, and that it had started "a new era of appreciation" of the poem.&lt;ref name=Heaney/&gt;

===New light from Tolkien's ''Beowulf'' translation===

Tolkien's own translation of ''Beowulf'', published posthumously in 2014 as ''[[Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary]]'', has been linked to the essay.&lt;ref name=Acocella/&gt;&lt;ref name=Garth/&gt; Shippey has argued that the translation throws light on "what Tolkien really thought in 1936". Tolkien stated, for instance, that Beowulf was not an actual picture of Scandinavia around 500 AD, but was a self-consistent picture with the marks of design and thought. This might leave the reader wondering, commented Shippey, what exactly Tolkien meant by that. Shippey argued that there was evidence from the chronology given in the 2014 book, supported by the work of scholars such as Martin Rundkvist, that there was serious trouble among the eastern Geats, with migration and the taking over of mead-halls by new leaders, at that time, just as portrayed in the poem.&lt;ref name=Shippey2017&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shippey |first1=Tom |title=JRR Tolkien's Beowulf with Dr. Tom Shippey - Lecture 3 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl8-pYYLNFQ |publisher=Signum University |accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rundkvist&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rundkvist |first1=Martin |title=Mead-Halls of the Eastern Geats |url=http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/wp-content/blogs.dir/417/files/2012/04/i-622119bd51bd29c8f4006bdff70524df-Rundkvist%202011%20Mead-halls.pdf |accessdate=4 September 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316213745/http://scienceblogs.com/aardvarchaeology/wp-content/blogs.dir/417/files/2012/04/i-622119bd51bd29c8f4006bdff70524df-Rundkvist%202011%20Mead-halls.pdf |archivedate=16 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The origins of the Bhagavata Mela are in [[Kuchipudi]], another more ancient classical Indian dance, found in [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref name="BrandonBanham1997p79"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Projesh Banerji|title=Indian Ballet Dancing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5fXZKe3xHQAC&amp;pg=PA42|year=1983|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-0-391-02716-9|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion of the region by Islamic armies led to the fall of a Hindu empire, which triggered the mass migration of Hindu performance artist families to Tamil Nadu in 16th century, where the dance evolved into modern Bhagavata Mela.&lt;ref name="BrandonBanham1997p79"/&gt; Prior to its fall, the court records of the Deccan region based [[Vijayanagara Empire]] – known for its patronage of the Indian religions and arts – indicate that drama-dance troupes of ''Bhagavatas'' from Kuchipudi village performed at the royal court.{{Sfn|Ragini Devi|1990|pp=67-68}}{{Sfn|Reginald Massey|2004|pp=79-80}} The region saw wars and political turmoil, ending in the formation of Deccan Sultanates in 16th century.&lt;ref name="Latif2010p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bilkees I. Latif|title=Forgotten|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-SCyobP0koC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-306454-1|pages=132, 71–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the fall of Vijayanagara Empire and the destruction of temples and Deccan cities by the Muslim army around 1565, musicians and dance-drama artists migrated south, and Tanjore kingdom records indicate that some 500 such Kuchipudi artist families arrived from Andhra, were welcomed and granted land by the Hindu king Achyutappa Nayak, a settlement that grew to become modern [[Melattur, Tamil Nadu|Melattur]] near Tanjore (also called [[Thanjavur]]).&lt;ref name="BrandonBanham1997p79"/&gt;{{Sfn|Ragini Devi|1990|pp=67-68}} These families maintained their Kuchipudi-inspired dance drama culture, in a form called Bhagavata Mela.&lt;ref name="BrandonBanham1997p79"/&gt;

Kuchipudi declined and was a dying art in 17th-century Andhra,&lt;ref name="Latif2010p71" /&gt; but in 1678, the last Shia Muslim [[Nawab]] of [[Golkonda Sultanate|Golkonda]], [[Abul Hasan Qutb Shah]], saw a Kuchipudi performance and was so pleased that he granted the dancers lands around the Kuchipudi village, with the stipulation that they continue the dance-drama.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dances of India: A General Survey and Dancers' Guide|last=Massey|first=Reginald|last2=Massey|first2=Jamila|publisher=Tricolour Books|year=1989|isbn=0-948725-04-4|location=United Kingdom|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kuchipudi: Indian Classical Dance Art|last=Kothari|first=Sunil|last2=Pasricha|first2=Avinash|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=2001|isbn=9788170173595|location=India|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shia Sultanate was overthrown in 1687 by the Sunni Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]].&lt;ref name="Latif2010p71" /&gt; In order to regulate public and private morals, as well as end un-Islamic practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ahsan Jan Qaisar|author2=Som Prakash Verma|author3=Mohammad Habib|title=Art and Culture: Endeavours in Interpretation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hic3XnRU-VgC&amp;pg=PA7 |year=1996|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-315-1 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aurangzeb banned public performances of all music and dance arts, along with ordering the confiscation and destruction of musical instruments in Indian subcontinent under control of his [[Mughal Empire]].&lt;ref name="Eraly2000p408"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Eraly|title=Emperors of the Peacock Throne: The Saga of the Great Mughals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04ellRQx4nMC |year=2000|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-100143-2 |pages=408–409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohan Khokar|title=Traditions of Indian classical dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=prjnAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Peter Owen |isbn=978-0-7206-0574-7|pages=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deccan region saw wars and political turmoil with Mughal imperial expansion ending the Deccan Sultanates by the end of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Latif2010p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bilkees I. Latif|title=Forgotten|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-SCyobP0koC |year=2010|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-306454-1|pages=132, 71–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, more Bhagavatar community families moved south, invited by the newly established Maratha rajas in the Kaveri delta, to settle in and around Kumbakonam. These families maintained their Kuchipudi-inspired dance drama culture, in a form called Bhagavata Mela.&lt;ref name="BrandonBanham1997p79"/&gt;

==Repertoire==
The Bhagavata Mela is traditionally celebrated in Hindu temple grounds or next to a temple, starting after dusk and through the night, and like the original Kuchipudi artists, male [[Brahmin]]s were the artists who played the role of men and women characters in the underlying story.&lt;ref name="BrandonBanham1997p79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FisherShay2009p388"/&gt; Modern productions include both male and female artists, and has evolved to show influences of both Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam – the main classical dance of Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name=brandon10&gt;{{cite book|author1=James R. Brandon|author2=Martin Banham|title=The Cambridge Guide to Asian Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttnH5W9qoBAC&amp;pg=PA79|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58822-5|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all classical dances of India, the Bhagavata Mela incorporates sophisticated gestures as sign language combined with intricate footwork and acting (''abhinaya'') to communicate a religious story with spiritual message.&lt;ref name=rubin139/&gt;&lt;ref name=brandon10/&gt; These aspects of the Bhagavata Mela have roots in the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', the ancient Hindu text on performance arts.{{Sfn|Ragini Devi|1990|pp=67-68}} The performance includes ''Nritta'', ''Nritya'' and ''Natya''. The ''Nritta'' performance is abstract, fast and rhythmic aspect of pure dance.&lt;ref name=koskoff955/&gt; The ''Nritya'' is slower and expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate feelings, storyline particularly with spiritual themes.&lt;ref name=koskoff955&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellen Koskoff|title=The Concise Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: The Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=73MO0eiQD_EC&amp;pg=PA955 |year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-99404-0 |pages=955 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Natya'' is a play performed by a team of artists.{{Sfn|Reginald Massey|2004|pp=33-38, 83-84, 207-214}}&lt;ref name="NettlStone1998p516"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruno Nettl|author2=Ruth M. Stone|author3=James Porter et al|title=The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: South Asia : the Indian subcontinent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOlNv8MAXIEC&amp;pg=PA516|year=1998|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-8240-4946-1 |pages=516–521}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of ''abhinaya'' are also found in the ''Natyashastra'' text which describes basic units of dance, the gestures and movements that connect with the audience and aesthetically arouses joy in the spectator, and transports the individual into a super sensual inner state of being.{{Sfn|Ragini Devi|1990|pp=67-68}}{{Sfn|Tarla Mehta|1995|pp=3-5}}

The communication in Bhagavata Mela is in the form of expressive gestures (mudras or hastas) synchronized to music. The gestures and facial expressions convey the ''ras'' (sentiment, emotional taste) and ''bhava'' (mood) of the underlying story.&lt;ref name="BajajVohra2015p82"/&gt; Like other Hindu classical dances, the artist successfully expresses the spiritual ideas by paying attention to four aspects of a performance: ''Angika'' (gestures and body language), ''Vachika'' (song, recitation, music and rhythm), ''Aharya'' (stage setting, costume, make up, jewelry), and ''Sattvika'' (artist's mental disposition and emotional connection with the story and audience, wherein the artist's inner and outer state resonates).&lt;ref name="BajajVohra2015p82"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tanvi Bajaj |author2=Swasti Shrimali Vohra|title=Performing Arts and Therapeutic Implications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MRcCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-32572-7 |pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Abhinaya'' draws out the ''bhava'' (mood, psychological states).&lt;ref name="BajajVohra2015p82"/&gt;

The Bhagavata Mela stories are typically from the Hindu Epics or the [[Puranas]], with ''Prahlada Charitram'' being particularly popular.&lt;ref name=rubin139/&gt; The music is [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] style, and most of the underlying story is sung to the rhythm of the music while the dance artists perform.&lt;ref name=brandon10/&gt; The repertoire is aided by an orchestra of musical instruments, with [[mridangam]] (drum) and cymbals providing the beat, and flute, string instruments and harmonium completing the ensemble.&lt;ref name=brandon10/&gt;

'''Bon pour l'Orient''' (good enough for the [[Orient]]) is a [[French language|French]] condescending term that refers to the stamps affixed in the 19th century to the diplomas of students coming from [[Colony|colonial]] or [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] territories. These students were subjected to a less intensive level of education in [[Western world|Western]] educational institutions and obtained degrees which despite being useless in Europe, were deemed good enough to secure employment in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reporting the Middle East: The Practice of News in the Twenty-First Century|last=Harb|first=Zahera|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2017|isbn=1786721767|location=|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern use, the phrase pejoratively describes practices which although unacceptable in advanced Western countries, might be thought appropriate for less developed countries.

'''Brand New Theatre''', abbreviated '''BNT''', is the oldest student [[theater company]] at the [[University of Southern California]], and the only organization on campus to produce only student-written work. BNT was founded by Joe Douglass in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll104/id/154001/rec/164|title = Daily Trojan article on founding of Brand New Theater (see page 7):|date = November 15, 1996|access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow student [[playwrights]] the opportunity to see their work produced, and give student actors and directors the opportunity to shape a show in collaboration with its writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Charney|first=Amanda|title=The Land of Opportunity in Independent Student Productions|url=http://www.theatermania.com/los-angeles-theater/tmu/02-2012/the-land-of-opportunity-in-independent-student-pro_50190.html|publisher=Theater Mania|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BNT prioritizes the inclusion of [[undergraduate]] students from outside the [[USC School of Dramatic Arts]], and USC students from widely disparate [[Academic major|majors]] and departments have participated as actors, writers, directors, and producers for BNT shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Will|title=Independent Student Productions at USC|url=http://viterbivoices.usc.edu/will/independent-student-productions-at-usc/|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's name draws from the fact that it only produces original work; every show is brand new.

==One-Act Plays==
The productions for which they are best-known, BNT produces a series of [[One-act play|one-acts]] every [[semester]]. The organization curates submissions from throughout the student body, and a reading committee made up of BNT executives and student volunteers read every show and collectively select the one-acts that will together produce the strongest show; typically four are chosen. At this point, the playwrights participate in a writing workshop to finalize their scripts, and often remain involved in the drafting and production process in collaboration with their show's director and cast.

==Full-Length Show==
In 2012, BNT produced its first full-length student-written show, and has continued to do so every [[Spring (season)|Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brand New Theatre's "Get.That.Snitch." by Achilles Capone|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/461375392/brand-new-theatres-getthatsnitch-by-achilles-capon|publisher=KickStarter|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process is similar to that of the one-acts: submissions are called for, and a reading committee selects a single show to be produced.

===List of BNT Full-Length Productions===
*2012: '''Here's The Thing''' by Jake Minton
*2013: '''Get. That. Snitch.''' by Achilles Capone
*2014: '''Animal Stories''' by Molly Sharpe
*2015: '''The Adventurers Club''' by Kyle Bellar
*2016: '''Stars &amp; Shadows''' by Jonathan Stoller-Schoff
*2017: '''This Our Now''' by Olivia Cordell

==24-Hour Festival==
BNT also sponsors a 24-hour theater festival every [[Spring (season)|spring]]. From 10 pm to 10 am, individuals and teams work together to produce the script for a show or a series of shows based on a prompt. Then, from 10 am to 10 pm, the script is passed off to actors and producers, who memorize lines, block the show, acquire necessary [[Theatrical property|props]], [[costumes]], and [[Theatrical scenery|sets]], and rehearse the show. At 10 pm, the curtain goes up, exactly one day after the show was first conceived.

==Writers' Workshop==
In 2014, BNT will expand its one-acts writers workshop into an open forum that meets regularly, as a resource for student playwrights throughout USC to offer feedback and help to one another on scripts they're drafting. The workshop meets twice a month, and is not officially associated with the selection process for BNT's productions that year.

The '''City of Sydney flag''' is made up of a horizontal triband of three colours – white, gold and blue. It was designed in 1908. The top third of the flag features three designs. The flag is displayed in [[Town Hall, Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sydney's flag and flower|url=http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/learn/sydneys-history/civic-history/symbols-of-the-city/sydney-flag-and-flower|publisher=City of Sydney|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
In the top left are the arms belonging to [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney|Thomas Townshend, Viscount Sydney]], after whom the city was named. The English Naval Flag in the centre acknowledges the role [[Arthur Phillip]] played in [[Sydney]]'s foundation. The red cross is overlaid with a globe and two stars, the principal features of [[James Cook]]'s arms, which were granted as a posthumous honour for his service in mapping Australia. 

The arms in the top right belong to the first [[List of mayors, lord mayors and administrators of Sydney|Lord Mayor of Sydney]], [[Thomas Hughes (Sydney mayor)|Thomas Hughes]]. It was during his term of office that the title of Mayor became Lord Mayor, and the official coat of arms for the city was granted. The remaining field of the flag features a ship under full sail, an allusion to the prominence of Sydney as a maritime port.

'''''Clue'''''  is a 1985 American [[ensemble film|ensemble]] [[Mystery film|mystery]] [[comedy film]] based on the [[Cluedo|board game of the same name]]. The film was directed by [[Jonathan Lynn]], who collaborated on the script with [[John Landis]], and stars [[Eileen Brennan]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Madeline Kahn]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Michael McKean]], [[Martin Mull]], and [[Lesley Ann Warren]]. The film was produced by [[Debra Hill]].

In keeping with the nature of the board game, the theatrical release included three possible endings, with different theaters receiving one of the three endings. In the film's home video release, all three endings were included. The film initially received mixed reviews and did poorly at the [[box office]], ultimately grossing $14.6 million in the United States against its budget of $15 million,&lt;ref name="Clue 1985"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=clue.htm |title=Clue (1985) |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date=1988-07-05 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it later developed a [[cult following]].&lt;ref name= "Buzzfeed"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/something-terrible-has-happened-here-the-crazy-story-of-how |title='Something Terrible Has Happened Here': The Crazy Story of How 'Clue' Went from Forgotten Flop to Cult Triumph |publisher=Buzzfeed.com |date=2013-09-02 |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 1954, six strangers are invited to a dinner party at Hill House, a secluded New England mansion. They are met by the [[butler]], Wadsworth, who gives each of them a [[pseudonym]], with none of them knowing or being addressed by their real names. The guests – Colonel Mustard, Mrs. White, Mrs. Peacock, Mr. Green, Professor Plum, and Miss Scarlet – are served by Wadsworth and the maid, Yvette.

During dinner, a seventh guest, Mr. Boddy, arrives. Afterwards, Wadsworth reveals the real reason they are there: Mr. Boddy has been [[blackmail]]ing the other guests (as well as Wadsworth and his now-dead wife, it is later revealed) for some time now. The group is here to confront him and turn him over to the police.

Mr. Boddy, however, reminds them that if he is arrested, their guilty secrets for which he has been blackmailing them will be exposed. He then gives each of the other guests a different weapons as a gift (a [[candlestick]], a [[dagger]], a [[Water pipe|lead pipe]], a [[revolver]], a [[rope]], and a [[wrench]]), suggesting that one of them kill Wadsworth instead to avoid exposure and humiliation. When he turns out the lights, a gunshot rings out, and when the lights are turned back on, they find Mr. Boddy apparently dead with no visible trace as to how. Later, the cook Mrs. Ho is found dead, stabbed with the dagger, and Mr. Boddy's body disappears, only to be rediscovered dead again but with new injuries from the candlestick.

Wadsworth locks the weapons in the cupboard and is about to throw the key out when a stranded motorist arrives and is locked in the [[Living room|lounge]]. Wadsworth then throws the key out onto the blacktop. Colonel Mustard proposes they split into pairs and search the house to make sure no one else is there. While they are searching, the motorist is killed with the wrench by a figure that is presumed to be his former employer. Mustard and Scarlet find his corpse in the locked lounge and Yvette uses the revolver from the now-open cupboard to break the keyhole. A police officer investigating the motorist's abandoned car arrives and comes inside to use the phone. The guests resume their search of the mansion. The electricity is then turned off. Yvette, the cop, and a singing telegram girl are subsequently murdered with the rope, lead pipe, and revolver, respectively.

Wadsworth and the others regroup after he turns the electricity back on, and he reveals he knows who the murderer is. He proceeds to recreate the events of the night so far as to explain how the murders occurred. He reveals that the other five people who died with Mr. Boddy were his accomplices, who gave him vital information about the different guests. After an evangelist interrupts them, Wadsworth continues and shuts off the electricity again.

In the theatrical showing, at this point audiences would then be shown one of the three following endings after Wadsworth brings the lights back up. In the home media, all three endings were included, with "Ending A" and "Ending B" identified as possible endings but "Ending C" being how the events really occurred.

===Ending A===
Yvette murdered the cook and Mr. Boddy under orders from Miss Scarlet, for whom she once worked as a call girl. Miss Scarlet then killed her along with the other murder victims. She wanted to keep her business of extortion safe and now plans to sell the other guests' secrets. She intends to shoot Wadsworth, who asserts there are no more bullets in the gun. Wadsworth then reveals himself to be an undercover FBI agent, takes the gun from Miss Scarlet and apprehends her. The evangelist is revealed to be a police chief, who arrives with cops and agents. To prove that the gun was empty, Wadsworth fires it towards the ceiling. However, it still contained one bullet, and the gunshot brings down the hall chandelier right behind Colonel Mustard, narrowly missing him (again, the first time being when Yvette breaks the keyhole).

===Ending B===
Mrs. Peacock killed all the victims to cover up her engagement of bribes from foreign powers. Mrs. Peacock holds the others at gunpoint while she escapes to her car, but she is caught by the chief (the evangelist). Wadsworth reveals he is an undercover FBI agent planted to spy on her activities as to secure her arrest.

===Ending C===
Each murder was committed by a different person. Professor Plum killed Mr. Boddy in the hall with the candlestick, Mrs. Peacock killed the cook in the kitchen with the knife, Colonel Mustard killed the motorist in the lounge with the wrench (and picked out the key from Wadsworth's pocket), Mrs. White killed Yvette in the billiard room with the rope, and Miss Scarlet killed the cop in the library with the lead pipe. Mr. Green is therefore accused of killing the singing telegram girl, but Wadsworth reveals he killed her in the hall with the revolver, and that he is, in fact, the real Mr. Boddy (the man Professor Plum killed was his butler). With the witnesses to each of their secret activities dead and the evidence destroyed, Mr. Boddy now plans on continuing to blackmail them all. Mr. Green suddenly pulls out a revolver and kills Mr. Boddy. He reveals himself as an undercover FBI agent who has been on Mr. Boddy's case. He brings in the chief/evangelist to arrest the others.

==Production==

===Development===
The multiple-ending concept was developed by [[John Landis]], who claimed in an interview to have invited playwright [[Tom Stoppard]], writer and composer [[Stephen Sondheim]] and actor [[Anthony Perkins]] to write the screenplay. The script was ultimately finished by director Jonathan Lynn.&lt;ref name = Buzzfeed /&gt;

A fourth ending was filmed, but Lynn removed it because, as he later stated, "it really wasn't very good. I looked at it, and I thought, 'No, no, no, we've got to get rid of that.'"&lt;ref name="farr20120313"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abnormaluse.com/2012/03/abnormal-interview-my-cousin-vinny-director-jonathan-lynn.html | title=Abnormal Interviews: My Cousin Vinny Director Jonathan Lynn | publisher=Gallivan, White &amp; Boyd, P.A. | work=Abnormal Use: An Unreasonably Dangerous Products Liability Blog | date=2012-03-13 | accessdate=June 8, 2012 | author=Farr, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the unused fourth ending, Wadsworth committed all of the murders. He was motivated by his desire for perfection. Having failed to be either the perfect husband or the perfect butler, he decided to be the perfect murderer instead. Wadsworth reports that he poisoned the champagne the guests had drunk earlier so they would soon die, leaving no witnesses. The police and the FBI arrive, and Wadsworth is arrested. He breaks free and steals a police car, but his escape is thwarted when three police dogs lunge from the back seat. This ending is documented in ''Clue: The Storybook'', a tie-in book released in conjunction with the film.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, pp. 57-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
[[Carrie Fisher]] was originally contracted to portray Miss Scarlet, but withdrew to enter treatment for drug and alcohol addiction.&lt;ref name = ewbad&gt;[http://movieline.com/2011/12/14/bad-movies-we-love-clue/ Bad Movies We Love: ''Clue'']&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Lynn's first choice for the role of Wadsworth was [[Leonard Rossiter]], but he died before filming commenced. The second choice was [[Rowan Atkinson]], but it was decided that he wasn't well known enough at the time, so Tim Curry was eventually cast.

===Filming===
''Clue'' was filmed on [[sound stage]]s at the [[Paramount Pictures]] film studios in Hollywood. The set design is credited to Les Gobruegge, Gene Nollmanwas, and William B. Majorand, with set decoration by Thomas L. Roysden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088930/fullcredits#cast | title=Full cast and crew for Clue (1985) | accessdate=2007-08-15 | publisher=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; To decorate the interior sets, authentic 18th and 19th century furnishings were rented from private collectors, including the estate of [[Theodore Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/| title=80s Rewind, Clue (1985)| accessdate=2007-08-15| publisher=www.fast-rewind.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completion, the set was bought by the producers of ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', who used it as the fictional hotel ''The Carlton''.

All interior scenes were filmed at the Paramount lot, with the exception of the ballroom scene. The ballroom, as well as the driveway gate exteriors, were filmed on location at a mansion located in [[South Pasadena, California]]. This site was destroyed in a fire on October 5, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.fast-rewind.com/| title=Photos from Filming Location - 2003 | accessdate=2007-08-15| publisher=www.theartofmurder.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exterior shots of the Pasadena mansion were enhanced with [[matte painting]]s to make the house appear much larger, and these were executed by matte artist Syd Dutton, in consultation with [[Albert Whitlock]].

The color of each character's car is the same color as his or her playing piece from the original board game.

==Release==
The film was released theatrically on December 13, 1985. Theaters received one of the three endings, and some theaters announced which ending the viewer would see.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19851212/REVIEWS/512120301/1023 Clue Review] - Roger Ebert. December 12, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novelizations===
The [[novelization]] was written by [[Michael McDowell (author)|Michael McDowell]] based on the screenplay by Jonathan Lynn. There was also a children's adaptation entitled, ''Paramount Pictures Presents Clue: The Storybook'' written by Landis, Lynn, and [[Ann M. Martin|Ann Matthews]]. Both adaptations were published in 1985, and differ from the movie in that they feature a fourth ending cut from the final film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXhKPQAACAAJ |publisher=Google Books |title=Paramount Pictures Presents Clue: The Storybook |deadurl=no |accessdate=August 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this ending, Wadsworth says that he killed Boddy as well as the other victims, and then reveals to the guests that he has poisoned them all so that there will be no witnesses and he will have committed the perfect crime. As he runs through the house to disable the phones and lock the doors, the chief detective – who had earlier been posing as an [[Cluedo characters#The Inspector|evangelist]] (Howard Hesseman) – returns, followed by the police, who disarm Wadsworth. Wadsworth then repeats the confession that he had given earlier to the guests, physically acting out each scene himself. When he arrives at the part about meeting Colonel Mustard at the door, he steps through the door, closes it, and locks it, leaving all the guests trapped inside. The police and guests escape through a window, while Wadsworth attempts to make a getaway in a [[police car|police squad car]], only to hear the growling of a [[Doberman Pinscher]] from the backseat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McDowell|first=Michael|title=Paramount PIctures Presents Clue|year=1985|publisher=Fawcett Gold Medal|location=New York|isbn=0-449-13049-5|pages=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Matthews |first=Ann |last2=Lynn |first2=Jonathan |last3=Landis |first3=John |title=Paramount PIctures Presents Clue: The Storybook |year=1985 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0-671-61867-9 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
The movie was released to home video in [[VHS]] format in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] in 1986 and, on February 11, 1991, to other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/clue/?dvd_ver=1#sell_thru_main |title=Clue Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released on DVD in June 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/clue/?dvd_ver=7#sell_thru_main |title=Clue Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Blu-ray]] on August 7, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=8058 |title=Paramount Teases Four Upcoming Blu-ray Releases |publisher=Blu-ray.com |date=2012-01-18 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The home video, television broadcasts, and on-demand streaming by services such as [[Netflix]] include all three endings shown sequentially, with the first two characterized as possible endings but the third (Ending C) being the true one. The Blu-ray and DVD however, gives you the option to watch the endings separately (chosen randomly by the player), as well as the "home entertainment version" ending with all three of them stitched together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Clue Blu-ray|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Clue-Blu-ray/37011/|accessdate=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soundtrack===
In February 2011, La-La Land Records released John Morris' score for the film as a limited-edition soundtrack CD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lalalandrecords.com/Clue.html |title=La-La Land Records Clue Soundtrack |publisher=La-La Land Records |date= |accessdate=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film was initially received with mixed reviews. Janet Maslin of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote negatively of the film and stated that the beginning "is the only part of the film that is remotely engaging. After that, it begins to drag."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C05E3DE143BF930A25751C1A963948260 |title='Clue,' from Game to Film |publisher= |date=December 13, 1985 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, writing, "''Clue'' offers a few big laughs early on followed by a lot of characters running around on a treadmill to nowhere."&lt;ref name=siskel&gt;{{cite news |first=Gene |last=Siskel |title=Did The Butler Do It? Clue Offers 3 Answers |newspaper=The Chicago Tribune |date=December 13, 1985 |page=A |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-12-13/entertainment/8503260263_1_outlying-theaters-star-john-morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Siskel particularly criticized the decision to release the film to theaters with three separate endings, calling it a "gimmick" that would distract audiences from the rest of the film, concluding that "''Clue'' is a movie that needs three different middles rather than three different endings."&lt;ref name=siskel /&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film a 2 out of 4 stars review, writing that despite a "promising" cast, the film's "screenplay is so very, very thin that [the actors] spend most of their time looking frustrated, as if they'd just been cut off right before they were about to say something interesting."&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger (1985). "[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/clue-1985Clue review]", retrieved 2014-06-05&lt;/ref&gt; On [[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies]], both agreed that the "A" ending was the best while the "C" ending was the worst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siskel|first1=Gene|last2=Ebert|first2=Roger|title=At the Movies with Siskel &amp; Ebert|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP5c9AbfnR0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=19m7s|date=December 1985|quote=The best ending...is "A"...stay away from the worst which is "C".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film holds a 59% positive rating on the [[film-critic]]s aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 27 reviews, with an average score of 5.8/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/clue/ |title=Clue Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
''Clue'' has grossed $14.6 million in North America, just short of its $15,000,000 budget.&lt;ref name="Clue 1985"/&gt;

==Remake==
[[Universal Studios]] announced in 2011 that a new film based on the game was being developed. The film was initially dropped,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Katey Rich |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Clue-Movie-Dropped-By-Universal-But-Hasbro-Is-Still-Making-It-On-Their-Own-26034.html|title=Clue Movie Dropped By Universal, But Hasbro Is Still Making It On Their Own |publisher=Cinema Blend |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; then resumed as Hasbro teamed up with [[Gore Verbinski]] to produce and direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Michael Fleming |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118000533.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title=Gore Verbinski to develop 'Clue' |publisher=Variety |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, The Tracking Board reports that Hasbro has landed at [[20th Century Fox]] with Josh Feldman producing for [[Hasbro Studios]] and Ryan Jones serving as the executive producer while Daria Cercek is overseeing for Fox. The film will be a "worldwide mystery" with action-adventure elements, potentially setting up a possible franchise that could play well internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tracking-board.com/20th-century-fox-gets-a-clue-and-will-produce-classic-board-game-remake-with-hasbro-exclusive/|title=20TH CENTURY FOX GETS A "CLUE" AND WILL PRODUCE CLASSIC BOARD GAME REMAKE WITH HASBRO (EXCLUSIVE)|publisher=The Tracking Board|last=Lyons|first=Josh|date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, Fox announced that [[Ryan Reynolds]], who had established a three-year [[first look deal]] with the studio, would star in a live-action remake of ''Clue'', with [[Rhett Reese]] and [[Paul Wernick]], writers for the Reynolds-led ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'', its [[Deadpool 2|sequel]] and ''[[Life (2017 film)|Life]]'', as scriptwriters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2018/film/news/ryan-reynolds-clue-movie-fox-1202672829/ | title = Ryan Reynolds Signs First-Look Deal at Fox With 'Clue' Movie in the Works | author = Dave McNary| date = January 22, 2018 | accessdate = January 25, 2018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dahomey Amazons''' or '''''Mino''''', which means "our mothers," were a [[Fon people|Fon]] all-female military regiment of the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] in the present-day [[Republic of Benin]] which lasted until the end of the 19th century. They were so named by Western observers and historians due to their similarity to the mythical [[Amazons]] of ancient [[Anatolia]] and the [[Black Sea]].

==Origin==
[[File:Dahomey amazon2.jpg|right|frame|Dahomey Amazons in around 1890]]
King [[Houegbadja]] (who ruled from 1645 to 1685), the third King of [[Dahomey]], is said to have originally started the group which would become the Amazons as a corps of elephant hunters called the ''gbeto''.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=20}}

Houegbadja's son King [[Agaja]] (ruling from 1708 to 1732) established a female bodyguard armed with muskets. European merchants recorded their presence. According to tradition, Agaja developed the bodyguard into a militia and successfully used them in Dahomey's defeat of the neighbouring kingdom of [[Savi]] in 1727.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} The group of female warriors was referred to as ''Mino'', meaning "Our Mothers" in the [[Fon language]], by the male army of Dahomey.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=44}} Other sources contest that King Agaja's older sister Queen Hangbe was the ruler to establish the units, however some contest if Queen Hangbe actually existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180826-the-legend-of-benins-fearless-female-warriors|title=The legend of Benin’s fearless female warriors|last=Macdonald|first=Fleur|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26|date=2018-08-26|website=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of King [[Ghezo]] (ruling from 1818 to 1858), Dahomey became increasingly militaristic. Ghezo placed great importance on the army, increasing its budget and formalizing its structure from ceremonial to a serious military. While European narratives refer to the women soldiers as "Amazons", they called themselves ''ahosi'' (king's wives) or ''Mino'' (our mothers).{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} Europeans exchanged goods such as knives, bayonets, firearms and fabrics for prisoners that the Dahomey captured during wars and raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02fdq|title=Dahomey - Google Arts &amp; Culture|work=Google Cultural Institute|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recruitment==
[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|[[Seh-Dong-Hong-Beh]], a leader of the Amazons]]
Ghezo recruited both men and women soldiers from foreign captives, though women soldiers were also recruited from free Dahomean women, some enrolled as young as 8 years old.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} Other accounts indicate that the ''Mino'' were recruited from among the ''ahosi'' ("king's wives") of which there were often hundreds.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=38}} Some women in Fon society became soldiers voluntarily, while others were [[conscription|involuntarily enrolled]] if their husbands or fathers complained to the king about their behavior.

Membership among the ''Mino'' was supposed to hone any aggressive character traits for the purpose of war. During their membership they were not allowed to have children or be part of married life (though they were legally married to the king). Many of them were virgins. The regiment had a semi-sacred status, which was intertwined with the [[Fon people|Fon]] belief in [[Vodun]].

The ''Mino'' trained with intense physical exercise. They learnt survival skills and indifference to pain and death, storming [[acacia]]-thorn defenses in [[military exercises]] and executing prisoners.{{sfn|Dash|2011}} Discipline was emphasised.

Serving in the ''Mino'' offered women the opportunity to "rise to positions of command and influence" in an environment structured for individual empowerment.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} The ''Mino'' were also wealthy and held high status.{{sfn|Dash|2011}}

==Political role==
The ''Mino'' took a prominent role in the Grand Council, debating the policy of the kingdom. From the 1840s to 1870s (when the opposing party collapsed), they generally supported peace with [[Abeokuta]] and stronger commercial relations with England, favouring the trade in [[palm oil]] above that in slaves; this set them at odds with their male military colleagues.{{sfn|Yoder|1974}}

Apart from the Council, the [[Annual Customs of Dahomey]] included a parade and reviewing of the troops, and the troops swearing of an oath to the king. The celebrations on the 27th day of the Annual Customs  consisted of a mock battle in which the Amazons attacked a "fort" and "captured" the slaves within,{{sfn|Yoder|1974}} a custom recorded by the priest Francesco Borghero in his diaries.{{sfn|Dash|2011}}

==Combat and structure==
The women soldiers were rigorously trained and given uniforms. By the mid-19th century, they numbered between 1,000 and 6,000 women, about a third of the entire Dahomey army, according to reports written by visitors. These documented reports also indicated that the women soldiers suffered several defeats.

The women soldiers were said to be structured in parallel with the army as a whole, with a center wing (the king's bodyguards) flanked on both sides, each under separate commanders. Some accounts note that each male soldier had a female warrior counterpart.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} In an 1849/50 account by an Englishman, it was documented that the women that had three stripes of [[whitewash]] around each leg, were honored with marks of distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dahomey And The Dahomans: Being The Journals Of Two Missions To The King Of Dahomey And Residence At His Capital 1849 To 1850|last=Forbes|first=Frederick|publisher=Kessinger Publishing LLC|year=2010|isbn=978-1163235027|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women's army consisted of a number of regiments: huntresses, riflewomen, reapers, archers, and gunners. Each regiment had different uniforms, weapons and commanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/womeninafrica/women-soldiers-dahomey/pedagogical-unit/4|title=The women soldiers of Dahomey pedagogical unit 4 {{!}} Women|website=en.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter period, the Dahomean female warriors were armed with Winchester rifles, clubs and knives. Units were under female command. A 1851 published translation of a war chant of the women claims the warriors would chant, "a[s] the [[blacksmith]] takes an iron bar and by fire changes its fashion so have we changed our nature. We are no longer women, we are men."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Maeve|date=Spring 2010|title=The Amazon Warrior Women and the De/construction of Gendered Imperial Authority in Nineteenth-Century Colonial Literature|url=http://m.ncgsjournal.com/issue61/New%20PDFs/NCGS%20Journal%20Issue%206.1%20-%20The%20Amazon%20Warrior%20Woman%20-%20Maeve%20E.%20Adams.pdf|journal=Nineteenth-Century Gender Studies|volume=6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Conflict with neighbouring kingdoms===
The Dahomey kingdom was [[History of the Kingdom of Dahomey|often at war]] with its neighbors, and captives were needed for the [[History of slavery|slave trade]]. The Dahomey women soldiers fought in slave raids, as referenced in the Zora Neale Hurston non-fiction work  [[Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"|Baracoon]], and in the unsuccessful wars against [[Abeokuta]].

==Conflict with France==

=== First Franco-Dahomean War ===
European encroachment into West Africa gained pace during the latter half of the 19th century, and in 1890 King [[Béhanzin]] started fighting French forces in the course of the [[First Franco-Dahomean War]]. European observers noted that they "handled admirably" in hand to hand combat, but that they did not know how to use their flintlocks.{{sfn|Dash|2011}} The Amazons participated in one major battle: Cotonou, where thousands of Dahoney (including many Amazons) charged the French lines and engaged the defenders in hand-to-hand combat. Despite the compliments given to them by the Europeans, the Amazons were decisively crushed, with several hundred Dahomey troops being gunned down while 129 Dahomey were killed in melee combat within the French lines. The French lost 5 men killed and a few dozen wounded.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=195}} 

=== Second Franco-Dahomean War ===
According to Holmes, many of the French soldiers fighting in Dahomey hesitated before shooting or bayoneting the Amazons. The resulting delay led to many of the French casualties. By the end of the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]], special units of the Amazons were being assigned specifically to target French officers.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=|pp=205}} After several battles, the French prevailed in the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] and put an end to the independent Dahomean kingdom. The legionnaires were impressed by the boldness of the Amazons and later wrote about the "incredible courage and audacity." Against a military unit with decidedly superior weaponry and a longer bayonet, however, the Dahomey Amazons could not prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Yoder, John C. (1974). "Fly and Elephant Parties: Political Polarization in Dahomey, 1840-1870". The Journal of African History. 15 (3): 417–432. doi:10.1017/s0021853700013566. &lt;/ref&gt; During a battle with French soldiers at [[Second Franco-Dahomean War#Battle of Adégon|Adegon]] on October 6 during the second war, the bulk of the Amazon corps were wiped out in a matter of hours in hand-to-hand combat after the French engaged them with a bayonet charge. For the loss of 86 Regulars and 417 Amazons, the Dahomey only managed to kill 6 French troops in the melee.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=203}}

==Disbandment==
[[File:The célébration at Abomey(1908). - The veteran amazones( AHOSI ) of the Fon king Béhanzin, Son of Roi Gélé.jpg|Veterans at in 1908.|thumb|Veterans at the annual meeting in Abomay in 1908]]
The troops were disbanded when the kingdom became a French [[protectorate]].{{sfn|Historical Museum of Abomey}} Oral tradition states that some surviving amazons secretly remained in Abomey afterwards, where they quietly assassinated a number of French officers. Other stories say the women pledged their services in protection of [[Agoli-agbo|Agoli-Agbo]], the brother of [[Béhanzin]], disguising themselves as his wives in order to guard him.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|pp=208-209}}

Some of the women married and had children, while others remained single. According to a historian who traced the lives of almost two dozen ex-amazons, all the women displayed difficulties adjusting to life as retired warriors, often struggling to find new roles in their communities that gave them a sense of pride comparable to their former lives. Many displayed a tendency to start fights or arguments that frightened their neighbours and relatives.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|pp=208-209}}

Between 1934 and 1942, several British travelers in [[Abomey]] recorded encounters with ex-amazons, now old women who spun cotton or idled around courtyards.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|pp=210-211}} The last survivor of the Dahomey Amazons is thought to have been a woman named Nawi. In a 1978 interview with a [[Benin|Beninese]] historian, Nawi claimed to have fought the French in 1892. Nawi died in November 1979, aged well over 100.{{sfn|Dash|2011}}

==In popular culture==

{{in popular culture|date=October 2018}}{{refimprove|date=October 2018}}
Dahomey Amazons were represented in the 1987 film ''[[Cobra Verde]]'' by [[German people|German]] director [[Werner Herzog]]. Ghezo's Amazons play a significant role in the novel ''[[Flash for Freedom!]]'' by [[George MacDonald Fraser]].

The unit is also depicted in (a special edition of, and now [[Downloadable content|DLC]] of) PC game ''[[Empire: Total War]]''. In the African Kingdoms expansion to ''[[Age of Empires II]]'', Gbeto are the Malian unique unit. In either game, the Dahomey/Gbeto are the only female military units.

A segment of ''[[QI]]'' Series 7 Episode 7 discussed Dahomey Amazons and showed a photo.

Referenced in [[Stieg Larsson]]'s novel ''[[The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest]]'' in the prelude to Part 4 ''Rebooting System''.

The warriors are also mentioned in [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s novel ''[[The Commodore]]'', book 17 of the [[Aubrey-Maturin series]].

The main character of [[Charles R. Saunders]] fantasy novel ''Dossouye'', an ahosi of Abomey, is closely modelled on the Dahomey ahosi.

[[P. C. Wren]]'s 1917 book of short stories ''[[Stepsons of France]]'' contains a story called ''"Here are Ladies"'', describing a series of clashes between troops of the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] and the Dahomey Amazons.

The warriors are also the main focus and written about in [[Layon Gray]]'s stage play ''[[Black Sparta]]''.{{sfn|Clodfelter|2017}}

The [[Dora Milaje]], army/bodyguards to the ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'', are based partially off the Dahomey Amazons.{{sfn|Johnson|2018}}

In [[Zora Neale Hurston]]’s ''[[Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"|Barracoon]]'', 86 year old Cudjo Lewis, the last known survivor of the slaver [[Clotilda (slave ship)|Clotilda]], describes his own capture by Dahomey Amazons when he was 19 years old.

The '''International Edible Book Festival''' is an annual event usually held on or around April 1, which is also known as '''Edible Book Day'''.&lt;ref name="week"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://week.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/theWeekContent.do?BV_ID=@@@&amp;contentType=EDITORIAL&amp;sectionName=TheWeek%20Lifestyle&amp;programId=1073755413&amp;contentId=6895557 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110714032142/http://week.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/theWeekContent.do?BV_ID=%40%40%40&amp;contentType=EDITORIAL&amp;sectionName=TheWeek%20Lifestyle&amp;programId=1073755413&amp;contentId=6895557 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = July 14, 2011 |title = Write Bite |date = March 21, 2010 |work = [[The Week]] |publisher = Malayala Manorama Publications |location = Kochi, Kerala |access-date = March 18, 2010 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The global event has been celebrated since 2000 in various parts of the world, where "edible books" are created, displayed, and small events are held. The creations are photographed and then consumed.&lt;ref name="week"/&gt; Regular contributors to the site are groups from Australia, Brazil, India, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Morocco, The Netherlands, Russia, and Hong Kong. The event was initiated by Judith A. Hoffberg and Béatrice Coron in 2000.&lt;ref name="week"/&gt;

[[Image:Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin.jpg|thumb|Title page of "Physiologie du Goût" ("Physiology of Taste") by French gastronome [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin]] (1755–1826) with a portrait of the author. 1848 edition.]]
The official website &lt;nowiki&gt;Books2Eat.com&lt;/nowiki&gt; says that the International Edible Book Festival is held to commemorate "the birthday of French gastronome [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin]] (1755–1826), noted for his book ''Physiologie du goût'', a witty meditation on food", though [[April Fools' Day]] is also related as "the perfect day to eat your words and play with them as the 'books' are consumed on the day of the event".&lt;ref name="books2eat"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.books2eat.com |title = International Edible Book Festival |publisher = Diffusion [[Adage]] |access-date = April 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'', as regards eating one's words.)

==Rules==
The participation rules per a related site are:&lt;ref name="books2eat"/&gt;

A [[University of Florida]] library holds the event as the '''Edible Book Contest''' in April, in connection with [[National Library Week]]. There are two rules for the contest: Entries should be edible, and they must somehow relate to a book. Besides edible books, other entries include "edible book trucks" and "edible bookmarks". The event kicks off with viewing of the entries, each of which has an information card describing the book title, author, and creator of the book art. The "books" are judged by a panel of judges and by public voting. Awards are given in categories like: Most Creative, Least Edible, Best Overall Fiction, Best Overall Non-Fiction, and Best Children's Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Malanchuk |first = Iona R. |title = Librarians As Community Partners: An Outreach Handbook |editor-first = Carol |editor-last = Smallwood |publisher = ALA Editions |year = 2010 |pages = 3–5 |chapter = Bake a Book and they will come |url = https://books.google.com/?id=O_-iFcSpsMYC&amp;pg=PA5 |isbn = 9780838910061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the event is planned to be held on April 15 and the award categories are: Best Overall Entry, Best Book Theme, Best Pun, Best Adult Book, and Best Children's Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.uflib.ufl.edu/news/2010/03/15/call-for-readers-and-edible-book-entries/ |title = Call for Readers and Edible Book Entries |date = March 15, 2010 |publisher = UF Library |access-date = March 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:An edible book.jpg|thumb|A cake with exposed layers resembling pages]]

Perkins Library at [[Hastings College]] in Nebraska (US) celebrated [[Banned Books Week]] 2008 by holding an edible book contest.  The event invited guests to consume cooked dishes and baked goods that resembled covers of banned books or reflected their content.  A reporter sums up the aptly named event: "Our celebration took Sir [[Francis Bacon]]'s famous words quite literally: 'Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and the other few to be chewed and digested.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Mark R. |last = Gould |title = The Library PR Handbook: High-Impact Communications |publisher = ALA Editions |year = 2009 |pages = 51–52 |chapter = Additional Tasty Examples of Food as a Promotional Tool |url = https://books.google.com/?id=zbUe2e-Z2b4C&amp;pg=PA51 |isbn = 9780838997260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the British newspaper [[Metro (British newspaper)|''Metro'']] ran a story that they would begin producing the newspaper on an edible "Sweet tasting paper" claiming to bring customers "news in the best possible taste".  The newspaper later clarified this was nothing more than an [[April Fools' joke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.worldofdeals.co.uk/other-electronics-deals/top-15-april-fools-2011-shopping-and-deals-pranks |title = Top 15 April Fool’s 2011 Shopping and Deals Pranks |date = April 1, 2011 |access-date = April 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graphic Arts Technical Foundation''' is a [[nonprofit]], scientific, technical, and educational organization which promotes the technological advancement of the [[printing]] industry worldwide. 

The Foundation fulfills its missions through its five divisions: research, training, consulting, quality controls, and publications. 

Its headquarters in [[Sewickley, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], includes state-of-the-art prepress, pressrooms, testing laboratories, libraries, and classrooms that provide a platform for sheetfed and web printing research. GATF's research activities include waste control, environmental studies, press and prepress research, and quality control. Educational activities include a large graphic arts library, a publication program, career and curricular consultation for schools and universities, and seminars, workshops, and conferences for the graphic arts community.

In 1999 GATF consolidated with the [[Printing Industries of America]] becoming Printing Industries of America/Graphic Arts Technical Foundation (PIA/GATF)utilizing a logo that was a combination of the two independent organizations logos. In 2009 after an extensive re-branding initiative, the association changed its name to Printing Industries of America and unveiled a new logo. The Graphic Arts Technical Foundation has subsequently become a division of Printing Industries of America known as the Center for Technology and Research.

GATF was established in 1924 as the Lithographic Technical Foundation, when [[lithography]] was a relatively new commercial printing process. It was headquartered in [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]] for many years until the 1960s, when it was renamed GATF and moved near to [[Carnegie Mellon University]], with whom it often partnered.

'''Herman Charles Merivale''' [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] (27 January 1839 – 17 August 1906)  was an English dramatist and poet, son of [[Herman Merivale]].  He also used the [[pun]]ning [[pseudonym]] '''Felix Dale'''.

==Life==
A [[barrister]], writer, and [[civil servant]] who was Permanent Under-Secretary of the [[India Office]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/sta/search/detailp.cfm?NID=57073&amp;EID=22723&amp;DID=&amp;AID= University of Glasgow library catalogue site]&lt;/ref&gt; he was educated at [[Harrow School]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] and [[Charles Bowen, Baron Bowen|Charles Bowen]] were his contemporaries. He graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1861. At his father's home he met many distinguished men, including Lord Robert Cecil (afterwards [[Prime Minister]] [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]), who became a lifelong friend. His friends in literary and dramatic circles included [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Anthony Trollope]], [[W. S. Gilbert]], [[Arthur Sullivan]], [[Edmund Yates]], [[Charles Dickens]] and others.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Elizabeth Lee, ‘Merivale, Herman Charles (1839–1906)’, rev. William Baker, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Following his father's death in 1874 he gave up the law in favour of literature and the theatre. Merivale wrote many farces and burlesques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=George |last=Wilman |title=Sketches of living celebrities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=alwBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA106 |year=1882 |publisher=Griffith and Farran |location=London |pages=106&amp;ndash;109 |chapter=Herman Charles Merivale}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[John Hollingshead]] he produced a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]], ''The Lady of Lyons Married and Settled'', performed at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] (5 October 1878), and ''Called There and Back'' (15 October 1884). ''The Butler'' (1886) and ''The Don'' (1888) were both written for the actor [[J. L. Toole]]. In writing ''The Don'', and other works, Merivale was assisted by his wife, Elizabeth, the daughter of John Pittman, whom he married in London on 13 May 1878.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

Suffering from depression for many years, following a breakdown&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W2twWm9taHAC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=herman+charles+merivale&amp;source=web&amp;ots=vusAKFK59v&amp;sig=tyMsTMXdqdHIvvlgCANICBYE0F4 MacKenzie, Charlotte.

A few years before his death Merivale became a [[Roman Catholic]]. He died suddenly of heart failure on 14 January 1906 at 69 Woodstock Road, [[Acton, London|Acton]], [[Middlesex]],&lt;ref&gt;The Times Obituary 17 January 1906&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in his father's grave in [[Brompton Cemetery]]. He had no children and his widow was granted a civil-list pension of £50 in 1906.

'''''Hydro Sapiens''''' is an art performance performed by The Lunatics from The [[Netherlands]]. It premiered in [[Singapore]] at [[Bedok Reservoir]] on  20 June 2008. It was the official closing performance for the [[Singapore Arts Festival]] and was a collaboration with the Singapore International Water Week.

The forty-five minutes play explores the power of water through comedy and drama. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For every question, there is an answer… What is the power of water? How weak can it make you? Should we fear it, love it, hate it? A human being is made up 66% percent out of water, so why do we need more? And in how many ways a man can drown? For all these questions, The Lunatics will try to find the answers - through a very intensive, hilarious, spectacular and even brutal search for the right value of water....&lt;ref name="aboutsingapore_hydrosapiens"&gt;[http://www.siww.com.sg/aboutsingapore/hydrosapiens.php Singapore International Water Week - Powered by GlobalSign.In&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


It featured various special effects like pyrotechnics and impressive machinations. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Twelve fanatic and truly wet actors, thousand of litres of water, 45 minutes of splashing experiences, countless moments of awe, laughter and silence, and water in your eyes. In 2008 The Lunatics would like to present to you their newest adventure: Hydro Sapiens!&lt;ref name="aboutsingapore_hydrosapiens" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For its premiere, it was open to the public for free. An estimated 5000 people attended the performance

A '''landhuis''' (plural ''landhuizen'') is a Dutch colonial country house, often the administrative heart of a ''particuliere land'' or private domain in the [[Dutch East Indies]], now Indonesia. Many country houses were built by the Dutch in other colonial settlements, such as [[Galle]], [[Cape Town]] and [[Curaçao]], but none as extensively or elaborately as in the Residency of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (an area that includes parts of modern-day [[Jakarta]], [[West Java]] and [[Banten]] provinces). Much of Batavia's reputation as "Queen of the East" rested on the grandeur of these 18th-century mansions.{{sfn|Gunawan Tjahjono 1998|pp=110-1}}

They were conceived as replicas of the Dutch architecture. Later, designs included features from [[Javanese traditional house|Javanese vernacular architecture]], partly in response to the tropical climate. The result, a fusion of Western and Javanese architecture, became known later as the ''Indies Style'' from the Dutch East Indies. The Indies Style is the first form of a fusion of Dutch and local architecture which gave rise to the subsequent style of early [[Rationalism (architecture)|Dutch Rationalist]] architecture in Indonesia. Despite its heritage and protected status, many of the Indies' country houses were left to deteriorate or were demolished, often due to lack of maintenance.{{sfn|Gunawan Tjahjono 1998|pp=110-1}} Many of these houses were within the complex owned by the [[Indonesian National Police|National Police]]. Many were transformed into dormitories with improper preservation.

==History==
In 17th century Netherlands, the increasing importance of Holland as a major maritime nation with a growing commercial empire, particularly in the East, had generated capital for the merchant classes of [[Amsterdam]]. These increasingly wealthy merchants began to invest their profits in second residences outside Amsterdam. This second residence, or ''landhuizen'', ranged from modest rural retreats to luxurious manor houses, and were typically seated along the rivers [[Amstel]] and [[Vecht (Utrecht)|Vecht]]. In Batavia, a similar trend occurred in the middle 18th century. When [[History of Jakarta|Batavia]] grew increasingly unhealthy during the 18th century, wealthy [[Dutch East India Company]] officials were the first to flee and build grand houses in the surrounding countryside, typically situated between the rivers and roads that led into Batavia.

The officials of the Dutch East India Company built country houses outside the walled city Batavia when the ''Ommelanden'' (the hinterland that lay immediately beyond the walled city) had been pacified and kept free from attacks by Javanese insurgents, who were trying to evict the Dutch occupiers. This was achieved by establishing a circular line of fortified field posts at places like Antjol, Jacatra, Noordwijk, Rijswijk, Angke, and Vijfhoek; most of which were established in the middle 17th century.

The first houses were simple structures, but as time went by, these became opulent country houses in luxurious pleasure gardens, often with their own music pavilion and belfry.

==Indies Style==
The Indies Style appeared very pronounced in the country houses of the Dutch Indies. This style appeared in late 18th-century and gradually adapted to the tropical climate. The style can be divided into three major archetypes: Dutch Style country houses, Transitional Dutch Indies country houses, and Indies style country houses.{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond 1990|pp=7-11}} At least one of each of the styles survived as of 2015.{{sfn|Gunawan Tjahjono 1998|pp=110-1}}

===Dutch Style country houses===
[[File:National Archives of Indonesia.jpg|thumb|right|Reiner de Kerk house, now known as the [[National Archives Building, Jakarta|National Archives building]], one of the few Indies country houses of this type that survives to this day.]]
Country houses in the Dutch Style (''Nederlandse stijl'') were popular between 1730-1770.{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond 1990|pp=7-11}} They are typically a two-story structure of near replicas of their Dutch counterparts. The Dutch influences are evident in the [[Hip roof|hipped roof]], closed and solid facade and high windows. They often came with belfries, a musical pavilion and a European pleasure garden.{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond 1990|pp=7-11}} The only concession to the tropical climate is the relatively large roof overhang compared with the originals. Unlike their Dutch counterparts, Batavian estates included extensive ancillary quarters to accommodate servants, often in the rear of the house.{{sfn|Gunawan Tjahjono 1998|pp=110-1}} The interior was usually larger than its Dutch counterpart, with a much taller ceiling.

Samples are Weltevreden country house, [[Groeneveld (estate)|Groeneveld House]] in Condet, Reinier de Klerk country house (now the building of the [[National Archives Building, Jakarta|National Archives of Indonesia]]), and [[Jan Schreuder]] country house.{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond 1990|pp=7-11}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Transitional Dutch Indies country houses===
[[File:Rumah Besar Cililitan 1930.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rumah Cililitan Besar]], the prototype of the Transitional Dutch Indies country houses, can still be seen today, but in a neglected condition.]]
These ''Nederlands-Indische stijl'',{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond 1990|pp=7-11}} appeared between 1750-1800. Their structure and form  show acculturation to the tropical climate. Still a two-story structure, the facades are protected from the sun and heavy rain by a larger overhanging roof on all sides. The roof profile resembles the local [[joglo]]-style roof traditionally reserved for Javanese noblemen. The upper floor is usually reached by an external staircase and often the central portion was left open for maximum ventilation; as well as tall windows with louvered shutters. The style was also popular in Sumatra.

Samples include [[Rumah Cililitan Besar]] (1775), which is still in existence, although deteriorating.{{sfn|Gunawan Tjahjono 1998|pp=110-1}} Other examples are ''Pondok Gedeh'' country house and ''Cengkareng'' country house.{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond 1990|pp=7-11}}

===Indies-style country houses===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Landhuis Depan bij Paal Merah Batavia TMnr 60016082.jpg|thumb|right|''Landhuis Depan'' in Batavia.]]
Also known as Indo-European house (''Indo Europeesche Stijl''){{sfn|Schoppert|Damais|1997|pp=72-7}} or ''Indische stijl'',{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond 1990|pp=7-11}} this type appeared between 1790-1820. The form represents the fusion of Dutch and indigenous (Javanese) style. Indies-style country houses were usually built as a single-story structure with front verandahs (''pringgitan'') and rear ''verandahs'' (''gadri''), covered by a [[joglo]]-type pitched roof that extended over the verandahs. Often the verandahs were connected to side galleries for weather protection. The verandah often had potted palms, cool concrete or marble tiles covered with split bamboo mats. The western reference appears in the [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] Tuscan columns supporting the large roof overhang and the decorated doors and windows.{{sfn|Gunawan Tjahjono 1998|pp=110-1}}

The style was replicated all around the archipelago in the later period. One of the few surviving examples is the dilapidated Cimanggis house, whose roof collapsed before 2013. Other examples are Japan House (built for Andries Hartsinck by the end of 18th century, demolished in 1996), Tjitrap (Citeureup) house, Telukpucung house, Camis house and Tjilodong (Cilodong) house.&lt;ref name="cilodong"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://poestahadepok.blogspot.com/2017/07/sejarah-kota-depok-21-sejarah-cilodong.html |title=

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Decline==
With the dissolution of the [[Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie|VOC]], country houses became less popular. During the 19th century, two groups of architectural movements occupied the Dutch East Indies: the universally accepted but fading [[neoclassical style]], appropriate for a colonial empire; and the [[Modern architecture|Modernist]], which gave rise to a neo-vernacular school that combined with [[Art Deco]] to create a tropical style dubbed as [[New Indies Style]].{{sfn|Gunawan Tjahjono|1998|pp=120}} Whereas the earlier Indies Style were essentially Indonesian houses with European trim, by the early 20th century, the trend was for [[modernist]] influences to be expressed in essentially European buildings with Indonesian trim. Practical measures carried over from the earlier Indies Style, which responded to the Indonesian climate, included overhanging eaves, larger windows and ventilation in the walls.{{sfn|Schoppert|Damais|1997|pp=104-5}}

'''Caroline Louisa Waring Atkinson''' (25 February 1834 – 28 April 1872) best known as '''Louisa Atkinson,''' was an early Australian writer, botanist and illustrator. While she was well known for her fiction during her lifetime, her long-term significance rests on her botanical work.&lt;ref name = "ANBG"&gt;Australian National Botanical Gardens&lt;/ref&gt; She is regarded as a ground-breaker for Australian women in journalism and natural science, and is significant in her time for her sympathetic references to Australian Aborigines in her writings and her encouragement of conservation.

==Life==

Louisa, as she was generally known, was born on her parents' property "Oldbury", Sutton Forest, about three miles from Berrima, New South Wales, and was their fourth child. Her father, James Atkinson, was the author of an early Australian book, ''An Account of the State of Agriculture and Grazing in New South Wales'', published in 1826. He died in 1834, when Louisa was only 8 weeks old.&lt;ref name = "JSNWL"&gt;Jessie Street National Women's Library (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Louisa was a somewhat frail child with a heart defect, and so was educated by her mother, [[Charlotte Barton]], herself the author of Australia's first children's book, ''A Mother's Offering to her Children''.

Her mother remarried, but this second husband, George Barton, a family friend, "became violently and irrevocably insane not long after the marriage"&lt;ref name = "Lawson"&gt;Lawson (1988) p. 69, 73, 79, 74, 75, 76, 71, 81, 72&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the family needing to leave "Oldbury".

She lived most of her life in [[Kurrajong, New South Wales|Kurrajong Heights]] in a home called ''Fernhurst'' that was built by her mother.&lt;ref name = "Birkett"&gt;Birkett (1938) p. 123, 123–4&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that she had lived briefly in [[Shoalhaven]] and Sydney.&lt;ref name = "JSNWL"/&gt; She became an active member of the community, operating as an unpaid scribe for the unlettered people of the district, a confidante of children, and a helper of the old and the sick. She also organised and taught in the district's first Sunday School.&lt;ref name = "Birkett"/&gt; Louisa and her mother returned to "Oldbury" in 1865, with her mother dying there in 1868.&lt;ref name = "Clarke43"&gt;Clarke (1988) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 March 1869, she married [[James Snowden Calvert]] (1825–84), a survivor of [[Ludwig Leichhardt|Leichhardt]]'s expedition of 1844–5 and also interested in botany.&lt;ref name = "Chisholm"&gt;Chisholm (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; He was, at the time, manager of Cavan station at Wee Jasper near [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]].&lt;ref name = "Clarke43"/&gt; She died at Swanton, near "Oldbury", in 1872, 18 days after the birth of her daughter, Louise Snowden Annie. She was buried in the Atkinson family vault at All Saints' Church, Sutton Forest. Her obituary in the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' described her as: "This excellent lady, who has been cut down like a flower in the midst of her days, was highly distinguished for her literary and artistic attainments, as well as for the Christian principles and expansive charity which marked her career".&lt;ref&gt;cited by Clarke (1988) p. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chisholm, she is also credited with being "something of a pioneer in dress reform: the long skirts of the period were simply a nuisance in scrubby areas and so this woman used, both when rambling and pony riding, attire [trousers] which is said to have aroused 'some twitterings in the ranks of the colonial Mrs Grundy'."&lt;ref name = "Chisholm"/&gt; Clarke writes that she was joined in this behaviour by Mrs Selkirk, a local doctor's wife.&lt;ref name = "Clarke40"&gt;Clarke (1988) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Botanist, naturalist and artist==

Louisa is acknowledged as a leading botanist who discovered new plant species in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] and Southern Highlands region of New South Wales, and she championed the cause of conservation during a period of rapid land-clearing. Her botanical interest is, in part, credited to her home-schooling by her mother who was herself artistic and interested in natural history.&lt;ref name = "Chisholm"/&gt;

She undertook botanical excursions in areas remote from where she lived, such as the [[Illawarra]], but she became particularly well informed on the flora in Kurrajong and environs, such as the [[Grose Valley]], [[Mt Tomah]] and [[Springwood, New South Wales|Springwood]], where she spent much of her life. She collected specimens extensively for Rev. Dr. William Woolls, a well-known teacher and amateur botanist, and [[Ferdinand von Mueller]].&lt;ref name = "ANBG"/&gt; Lawson writes that von Mueller's work was aided by many amateur naturalists in Australia, but that Atkinson's contribution is worthy of particular note "for the quality of its information, its scholarly commitment, its enthusiasm and persistence over time, its geographical range, its local depth, its robustness and liveliness of descriptive record, its sense of primary exploration, its sheer inventiveness".&lt;ref name = "Lawson"/&gt; She is commemorated in the Loranthaceous genus ''Atkinsonia'', and in the species ''Erechtites atkinsoniae'', ''Epacris calvertiana'', ''Helichrysum calvertiana'', ''Xanthosia atkinsoniana'' and ''Doodia atkinsonii''.

By the 1860s Atkinson was becoming aware of the impact of European agriculture on native flora. She wrote about this on several occasions, making such statements as "It needs no fertile imagination to foresee that in, say, half-a-century's time, tracts of hundreds of miles will be treeless".&lt;ref name = "Lawson"/&gt;

She is also well regarded as a [[botanical artist]], was interested in zoology and was a competent taxidermist.&lt;ref name = "ANBG"/&gt;
Her botanical art was unusual for its diversity: it included animals, birds, insects, reptiles and landscapes.&lt;ref name = "LawsonNSWSL"&gt;Lawson (1995) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

She popularised science and wrote for ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and the ''Horticultural Magazine''.

==Writer==

In another claim to fame, Louisa is credited as the first Australian-born woman to have a novel published in Australia, ''Gertrude the Emigrant'' (1857), for which she used the name "An Australian woman". She was 23 years old.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, M., 'Atkinson, (Caroline) Louisa Waring', in R. Aitken and M. Looker (eds), ''Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens'', South Melbourne, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary critic, G. B. Barton, described the novel as follows: "The scene is laid wholly in the Colony, principally in the bush; and nowhere are the peculiar features of bush life more accurately or graphically pourtrayed (sic). The tale abounds in incident, the characters are skilfully drawn, and the literary execution is quite equal to that of ordinary novels".&lt;ref&gt;cited by Clarke (1988) p. 41 &amp; 43&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also the first author to illustrate her own work.&lt;ref name = "JSNWL"/&gt; Her second novel, ''Cowanda, The Veteran's Grant'' (1859) had a cover design by colonial artist [[S. T. Gill]].&lt;ref name = "Clarke43"/&gt; Various other stories by her were serialised in ''[[The Sydney Mail]]''. She was deeply religious and her fiction, which can generally be described as "Victorian romance-melodrama",&lt;ref name = "Lawson"/&gt; conveyed simple moral messages through "intrusive explicit moralising".&lt;ref name = "Lawson"/&gt; Despite this, her novels are significant because "they are the first novels written by a native-born Australian woman; they offer, however roughly, a vigorously sustained depiction of Australian colonial life; and they offer a particular colonial, female perspective actively attempting to modify imported English values".&lt;ref name = "Lawson"/&gt; Lawson also argues that, through her personal experience, Atkinson is able to record in her fiction "a female perspective on an infant white Australia, both in its rushed ''ad hoc'' urban development and its equally ''ad hoc'' muddled pastoral growth".&lt;ref name = "Lawson"/&gt; The Jessie Street National Women's Library states that her work is important for promoting the rights of women and children&lt;ref name = "JSNWL"/&gt; and, in fact, Lawson suggests that "it is possible to see Atkinson as our first true humanist-democrat in fiction since she addresses the same observant analysis and compassion to white and black characters and to women as well as men".&lt;ref name = "Lawson"/&gt;

In addition to fiction, Atkinson also wrote natural science articles, and was 19 when, in 1853, the ''Illustrated Sydney News'' published her first illustrated articles, ''Nature Notes of the Month with Illustrations''. She was the first woman in Australia to have a long-running series of articles published in a major newspaper.&lt;ref name = "JSNWL"/&gt; This was a series of natural history sketches titled "A Voice from the Country". They appeared in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''The Sydney Mail'' from 12 December 1859 and ran for over 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Voice from the Country|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/13034287|website=Trove - National Library of Australia|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Clarke40"/&gt; They were "simply informative and popularising" with a "straightforward educational tone and intention".&lt;ref name = "Lawson"/&gt; An editorial note attached to the posthumous publication of her last story, ''Tessa's Resolve'', states that these articles "are looked upon somewhat as authorities in matters relating to Australian natural history and botany".&lt;ref&gt;cited by Clarke (1988) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the signature 'LA', becoming 'LC' in 1869, her illustrated, but more scientific, articles on flora and fauna were published in the ''Horticultural Magazine'' from 1864 to 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson (1994) p.47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Clarke41"&gt;Clarke (1988) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Madonna of the Quail''''' (Italian: ''Madonna della Quaglia'') is an [[International Gothic]] [[painting]] generally attributed to [[Pisanello]]. Dating to c. 1420, it was housed in the [[Castelvecchio Museum]] of [[Verona]], northern [[Italy]] until stolen in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/12008337/Armed-bandits-steal-masterpieces-worth-10-million-in-raid-on-Italian-art-museum.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting depicts the Madonna with Child crowned by two flying angels, sitting inside a rose garden in typical late Gothic style. The painter put a great attention in the representation of vegetables and birds, including the [[quail]] in the foreground, which gives its name to the painting. The heavenly appearance of the scene is enhanced by the gilt background.

The rendering of the Madonna and her clothes resemble those of the works by [[Gentile da Fabriano]], whose workshop   Pisanello was a member of at the time. The setting is also similar to the contemporary ''[[Madonna of the Rose Garden (Stefano da Verona)|Madonna of the Rose Garden]]'' by [[Michelino da Besozzo]] or [[Stefano da Verona]], also in the museum of Castelvecchio.

'''''Mercury Rising''''' is a 1998 American [[political film|political]] [[action film|action]] [[thriller film]] starring [[Bruce Willis]] and [[Alec Baldwin]]. Directed by [[Harold Becker]], the movie is based on [[Ryne Douglas Pearson]]'s 1996 novel originally published as [[Simple Simon (novel)|''Simple Simon'']]. Willis plays Art Jeffries, an [[undercover]] [[FBI]] agent who protects a 9-year-old [[autism|autistic]] boy who is targeted by government [[Assassination|assassins]] after he cracks a [[top secret]] government code.

The film was released on April 3, 1998. It received mostly negative reviews.

==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=December 2017}} 
A [[Code (cryptography)|cryptographic code]] called "Mercury" was created by the [[National Security Agency]] and is allegedly so complex that its creators believe no computer on Earth can decipher it. Originally it was created during the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] as a test to keep the United States' highest priority secrets under wraps. One day, the NSA receives a message from a nine-year-old [[autistic savant]] with [[child prodigy|prodigious]] [[mental calculator|math abilities]] named Simon Lynch ([[Miko Hughes]]), who calls a telephone number written in the code which was secretly published in a puzzle magazine by two of the creators, Dean Crandell ([[Robert Stanton (actor)|Robert Stanton]]) and Leo Pedranski ([[Bodhi Elfman]]), to see if anyone could break it. Crandell and Pedranski's division chief, Lt. Colonel Nicholas Kudrow ([[Alec Baldwin]]) sees the boy's ability to decipher the code as a grave liability.  He dispatches assassin Peter Burrell ([[Lindsey Ginter|Lindsey Lee Ginter]]) to murder the boy and his parents, Martin ([[John Carroll Lynch]]) and Jenny (Kelley Hazen).

After shooting Martin and Jenny, Burrell searches the house, fails to find Simon, and leaves at the sound of approaching sirens (Martin was able to call 911 before dying). FBI Agent Art Jeffries ([[Bruce Willis]]), demoted following a diagnosis of delusional paranoia after blaming himself for the death of a teenager in a hostage situation gone wrong, is sent to investigate what is initially thought to be a murder-suicide. While investigating the scene, Jeffries finds Simon hiding in a cache of his bedroom closet and takes the boy under his wing. Jeffries begins to realize the difficulty of protecting, let alone questioning, Simon because of his impaired social abilities as a result of his [[autism]], but the [[Chicago Police Department]] agree to assign a protection detail to Simon. Burrell tries to kill Simon again at the hospital, but Jeffries stops him. He is then forced to terminate an assassin named Shayes ([[Peter Stormare]]) on the [[Chicago 'L']] train. The situation is further complicated by the fact that nobody at the FBI believes Simon is in any danger, and Jeffries is soon framed by the NSA as a kidnapper, with only his best friend and fellow agent Tommy Jordan ([[Chi McBride]]) aware that he did not commit the crime, since Jordan had been in contact with Jeffries when the incident began. Jeffries borrows Jordan's car (which Jordan later reports stolen to conceal his involvement) and takes Simon back to his house. Simon again calls the telephone number written in the code and talks to Crandell and Pedranski. When Jeffries confronts them, a conflicted Crandell arranges a meeting via encoded e-mail at the [[Wrigley Building]]. The next morning, Jeffries meets a woman named Stacey Siebring ([[Kim Dickens]]) in a coffee shop and asks her to watch Simon for him.

Jeffries meets Crandell and the two talk and stroll on a busy sidewalk. Crandell tells Jeffries about "Mercury" and Kudrow, then Burrell shoots him from behind and gets away safely. Jeffries returns to the coffee shop, but Simon and Stacey are gone. He goes outside and spots them coming across the street. Stacey says she and Simon have become friends and Simon agrees. Jeffries and Simon then abruptly leave Stacey. Later in the middle of the night, Jeffries and Simon go to Stacey's house, asking for a place to stay. Stacey reluctantly agrees and tells Jeffries that she was going on a business trip to [[Des Moines]] to make the rent the next morning.

Meanwhile, Pedranski, having learned Crandell's fate, picks up where his friend left off by writing a pair of letters via typewriter: one to Jeffries and the other to the [[United_States_congressional_hearing#Oversight_hearings|Senate Oversight Committee]], revealing Kudrow's unlawful actions. Soon after, Pedranski is murdered by Burrell, who also snatches the letters. However, the assassin neglects to grab the carbon copies Pedranski tossed, which his girlfriend, NSA analyst Emily Lang ([[Carrie Preston]]), takes to the FBI. Jordan discreetly arranges for her to meet with Jeffries to show them both the [[carbon paper]] used to type the letter, which, being covered in Pedranski's fingerprints, is crucial evidence in its own right. After the meeting with Emily, Jeffries tells Stacey to call anyone for an emergency except the police, who were called off at the last minute, and gives her Jordan's number in case of an emergency. While Jeffries introduces himself to Kudrow at his birthday party and demands that Kudrow leave Simon alone, Jordan, under Jeffries' suggestion, arranges for Simon to go into Witness Protection. After the meeting, Jeffries calls Jordan, who explains that the Witness Protection meeting is going to happen, though they are unaware that their [[Telephone tapping|conversation is being monitored]] by Kudrow. When Jeffries returns and finds Stacey and Simon gone, he learns from Jordan that they are not in any danger and will meet them there, just as Jordan is given an order to head to the FBI director's office.

Kudrow tries to have FBI SAC (Special Agent in Charge) Joe Lomax ([[Kevin Conway (actor)|Kevin Conway]]) help turn the tables on Jeffries by using his authority and the fact that Jordan arranged the Witness Protection under false pretenses. He plans to have the NSA take over the protection for the meeting location. After Kudrow leaves, Jordan shows the evidence to Lomax and despite his initial doubts, Jordan confirms that the fingerprint markings on it were Pedranski's, now fully validating the evidence against Kudrow. Jeffries, with Jordan and a small FBI task force's help, sets a trap at the meeting spot. During the battle, Jordan protects Stacey, and the FBI team takes on Burrell, who is killed, trying to escape, when the windows blow out slashing his face open. Jeffries and Kudrow fight on the roof during which Simon walks to the edge of the roof and grabs Kudrow's gun, giving it to Jeffries and allowing him to take control as Jordan and the team come in. In a last-ditch effort to get his victim back, Kudrow grabs Simon, is shot at point blank range by Jeffries, and subsequently falls to his death over the edge of the building.

Jeffries later visits Simon (now living with foster parents) at his school. He embraces the FBI agent as a welcome friend, having finally accepted him as a person he trusts.

Miko Hughes won the category of ''Best Performance in a Feature Film—Leading Young Actor'' at the 1999 [[Young Artist Award]]s for his portrayal of Simon.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a score of 17% based on reviews from 35 critics with an average rating of  4.2/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mercury_rising/|title=''Mercury Rising''|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=December 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt; {{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film two stars out of four, writing: "''Mercury Rising'' is about the most sophisticated cryptographic system known to man, and about characters considerably denser than anyone in the audience. Sitting in the dark, our minds idly playing with the plot, we figure out what they should do, how they should do it, and why they should do it, while the characters on the screen strain helplessly against the requirements of the formula."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980403/REVIEWS/804030303/1023 ''Mercury Rising'' :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews]&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] rated it one and a half out of four stars, saying: "The script for ''Mercury Rising'' is exceptionally tiresome and hard-to-swallow. ... Once again, certain standby plot elements -- the high-level government conspiracy and the maverick law enforcement agent -- are recycled, and not to good effect. While Bruce Willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in Hollywood, this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension and too much nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/m/mercury.html Mercury Rising - A Film Review by James Berardinelli]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The film earned $10,104,715 in its opening weekend in 2,386 theaters. Altogether, the film grossed $32,935,289 in the United States and $60,172,000 internationally for a total of $93,107,289.&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt;

'''''Neue Berliner Musikzeitung''''' was a musical periodical that appeared in the years 1847-1896 and was published by Bote &amp; Bock. It was a continuation of the Berlin musical newspaper published between 1844-1847 by Karl Gaillard.
 
==History==
The ''Neue Berliner Musikzeitung'' reported extensively on the musical life in Berlin, but also on other cities in [[Germany]] and Europe. And together with the ''[[Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung]]'' and the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'', it was widely considered the most important and influential music periodical in [[Berlin]] as well as in the German states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vosteen|first=Annette|title=Berliner musikalische Zeitung|url=http://www.ripm.org/journal_info.php5?ABB=BRZ|publisher=RIPM|accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was the official publication of the Berlin Association of Musicians.
 
It was established by Gustave Bock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zeittafel |url=http://www.dtkv-berlin.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=175 |publisher=DTKV Berlin |accessdate=25 July 2011 |language=de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328050019/http://www.dtkv-berlin.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=175 |archivedate=28 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a former board member of the publisher, and Hermann Wolff (1845-1902), a former editorial director. Bock was the agent of [[Ferruccio Busoni]] and responsible for the founding of the Philharmonic Society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25496">'''Fine art nude photography''' is a [[genre]] of [[fine-art photography]] which [[Nude photography|depicts the nude]] human body with an emphasis on form, [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], emotional content, and other [[aesthetic]] qualities.

The [[Nude (art)|nude]] has been a prominent subject of [[photography]] since its invention, and played an important role in establishing photography as a [[fine art]] medium.

The distinction between fine art photography and other subgenres is not absolute, but there are certain defining characteristics.

[[Erotic photography|Erotic]] interest, although often present, is secondary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Clark, Kenneth| year=1956| title=The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form|chapter=1. The Naked and the Nude|publisher=Princeton University Press| location=Princeton| isbn=0-691-01788-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which distinguishes art photography from both [[glamour photography]], which focuses on showing the subject of the photograph in the most attractive way, and [[pornographic photography]], which has the primary purpose of [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]] the viewer. Fine art photographs are also not taken to serve any journalistic, scientific, or other practical purpose.

The distinction between these is not always clear, and photographers, as with other artists, tend to make their own case in characterizing their work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.krosenthal.com/photography.html|author=Rosenthal,Karin|title=About My Work|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavondyss.com/silverbeauty/about.htm|author=Schiesser, Jody|title=Silverbeauty - Artist Statement|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marcusart.net/|author=Mok, Marcus|title=Artist's Statement|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the viewer may have a different assessment.

The nude remains a controversial subject in all media, but more so with photography due to its inherent realism.&lt;ref name="Met"/&gt; The male nude has been less common than the female, and more rarely exhibited or published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Weiermair, Peter  |author2=Nielander, Claus  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Hidden Image: Photographs of the Male Nude in the 19th and 20th Centuries|publisher=MIT Press, 1988|isbn=0-262-23137-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of children as subjects in nude photography is especially controversial.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Those early photographers in [[Western culture]]s who sought to establish photography as a fine art medium, frequently chose women as the subjects for their nude photographs, in poses that accorded with traditional [[Nude (art)|nudes]] in other media. Before nude photography, art nudes usually used allusions to [[classical antiquity]]; gods and warriors, goddesses and nymphs. Depictions of male and female nudes in traditional art mediums had been mostly limited to portrayals as an ideal warrior or athlete (for men) or that emphasized divinity and reproduction (for women),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nuan/hd_nuan.htm|title=Sorabella, Jean. January 2008. The nude in western art and its beginnings in antiquity. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early photographic art first engaged these archetypes as well. Poses, [[Photographic lighting|lighting]], [[soft focus]], [[vignetting]] and hand [[Photo manipulation|retouching]] were employed to create photographic images that rose to the level of art comparable to the other arts at that time.&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2012/naked-before-the-camera|title=Naked before the Camera|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main limitation was that early photographs were [[monochrome]]. Although 19th century artists in other media often used photographs as substitutes for live models, the best of these photographs were also intended as works of art in their own right.

Nude photography was more controversial than painted nude works, and in order to avoid censorship some early nude photographs were described as "studies for artists",&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; while others were used as references by artists to do drawings and paintings as a supplement to live [[Model (art)|models]]. [[Eugène Delacroix]] was an early adopter of the practice of using photographs taken specifically for him by his friend, [[Eugène Durieu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Two Delacroix Drawings Made from Photographs|author=Van Deren Coke|journal=Art Journal|volume=21|issue=3|date=Spring 1962|pages=172–174|publisher=College Art Association|jstor=774417|doi=10.2307/774417}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edgar Degas]] made his own photographs that he used for painting references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=47047|title=After the Bath, Woman Drying Her Back|publisher=The J.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
As fine art photography first embraced and then moved passed classical allegorical imagery, both male and female photographers began to use the male nude as another medium to examine issues of representation and identity, sexuality and voyeurism.&lt;ref&gt;Weiermair, Peter (Ed.). (1994). ''The male nude: A male view: An anthology''. Zurich: Edition Stemmle.&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographing nudes (and particularly male nudes) became a way for women artists to engage the subject of “the nude” from the position of power traditionally reserved for male artists;&lt;ref&gt;Weiermair, Peter (Ed.). (1995). ''Male nudes by women: An anthology''. Zurich: Edition Stemmle.&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively, nude self-portraiture allowed men to begin to re-evaluate accepted definitions of sensuality and masculinity by photographing themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Massengill, Reed. (2005). ''Self-exposure : the male nude self portrait''. New York: Universe.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alfred Stieglitz ====
[[Alfred Stieglitz]] is a major figure in bringing modern art to America by exhibiting the new genre of art in his New York galleries at the beginning of the 20th century. He is known to the public perhaps more for his relationship with [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], whose nude photos he exhibited in 1921 while married to someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 2, 2001|title=ART REVIEW: Proselytizing for Modernism|first=Michael|last=Kimmelman}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Stieglitz used the camera as a kind of mirror. 'My photographs,' he wrote in 1925, 'are ever born of an inner need--an Experience of Spirit. I do not make ''pictures . . .'' I have a vision of life and I try to find equivalents for it sometimes in the form of photographs.' Often he would write of ''true seeing'' and of ''inness''. As O'Keeffe noted rightly, the man she knew so well was 'always photographing himself.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 6, 1983|title=Looking Back at the Seer of the New - Alfred Stieglitz: The Man, The Battle, The Art|author=Paul Richard|page=L1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Imogen Cunningham ====
[[Imogen Cunningham]] began taking photographs in Seattle in 1905, in the soft-focused ''[[Pictorialism|pictorialist]]'' style popular at that time; but she is best known for the sharp-focused modern style she developed later. She is also attributed as the first woman photographer to take a nude photo of a man (her husband, [[Roi Partridge]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sampling Imogen Cunningham's Vibrant Diversity|author=Charles Hagan |newspaper=New York Times|date=13 Oct 1995|page=C27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the work of [[Judy Dater]], one particular photo, ''Imogen and Twinka'', became one of the most recognizable images caught by an American photographer. It features a 91 year old Imogen Cunningham and a nude [[Twinka Thiebaud]].&lt;ref&gt;Fallis, Greg. [http://www.utata.org/sundaysalon/judy-dater/ Judy Dater], Sunday Salon with Greg Fallis, UTATA.org&lt;/ref&gt; The photo was the first adult full frontal nude photograph published in [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine, in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, Bicentennial Special Issue (1976) called: ''Remarkable American Women 1776-1976''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Man Ray ====
After [[World War I]], [[avant-garde]] photographers became more experimental in their portrayal of nudity, using reflective distortions and printing techniques to create abstractions or depicting real life rather than classical allusions.

Beginning in the late 1920s [[Man Ray]] experimented with the Sabattier, or [[solarization]] process, a technique that won him critical esteem, especially from the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Many of the central figures of Surrealism—[[André Breton|Breton]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]]—followed his example in using photography in addition to other media. Other photographers, such as [[Maurice Tabard]] and [[Raoul Ubac]], were directly inspired by Man Ray’s techniques, while photographers such as [[André Kertész]] and [[Brassaï]] were indirectly influenced by his innovative approach to the medium.

==== Edward Weston ====
[[Edward Weston]] evolved a particularly American aesthetic, using a [[Large format (photography)|large format]] camera to capture images of [[Nature photography|nature]] and [[Landscape photography|landscapes]] as well as nudes, establishing photography as a fine arts medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativephotography.org/artists/edward-weston|title=Edward Weston|publisher=University of Arizona, Center for Creative Photography|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 Weston became the first photographer to be awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccp.uair.arizona.edu/item/234|title=Edward Weston Photographs|publisher=Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona Libraries|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725011346/http://ccp.uair.arizona.edu/item/234|archivedate=2010-07-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a famous example of Weston's work see: [[Charis Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Conger, Amy| title=Edward Weston: The Form of Nude|publisher=Phaidon Press|year=2006|isbn=0-7148-4573-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bill Brandt ====
[[Bill Brandt]] is best known for a series of nudes developed primarily between 1945 and 1961, that are both personal and universal, sensual and strange, collectively exemplifying the “sense of wonder” that is paramount in his photographs. Brandt’s work is unpredictable not only in the range of his subjects but also in his printing style, which varied widely throughout his career. This exhibition is the first to emphasize the beauty of Brandt’s finest prints, and to trace the arc of their evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1343|title=Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diane Arbus ====
Many fine art photographers have a variety of subjects in their work, the nude being one. [[Diane Arbus]] was attracted to unusual people in unusual settings, including a nudist camp. [[Lee Friedlander]] had more conventional subjects, one being [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] as a young model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/02/12/madonna.photo.auction/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |title=Nude photo of Madonna goes for $37,500 |date=February 12, 2009 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The distinction between fine art and glamour is often one of [[marketing]], with fine art being sold through galleries or dealers in limited editions signed by the artist, and glamour photos being distributed through mass media.

For some, the difference is in the gaze of the model, with glamour models looking into the camera, while art models do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=Conrad,Donna  | publisher=PhotoVision| title = A Conversation with Ruth Bernhard| newspaper = Vol. 1 No. 3| year = 2000  | url = http://www.photovisionmagazine.com/articles/bernhard.interview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glamour and [[Fashion photography|fashion]] photographers have aspired to fine art status in some of their work. One of the first was [[Irving Penn]], who progressed from ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine to photographing fashion models such as [[Kate Moss]] nude. [[Richard Avedon]], [[Helmut Newton]] and [[Annie Leibovitz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/annie_leibovitz/|title=Exhibitions: Annie Leibovitz: A Photographer's Life, 1990–2005|publisher=The Brooklyn Museum|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; have followed a similar path with [[portrait]]s of the famous, many of them nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/feb/08/photography.art|title=Not naked but nude|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 November 2012|location=London|first=Jonathan|last=Jones|date=2006-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or partially clothed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/06/miley200806|title=Miley Knows Best|publisher=Vanity Fair|year=2008|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-modern era, where fame is often the subject of fine art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/22/andy-warhol-legacy-lives-on|title=Andy Warhol's legacy lives on in the factory of fame|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=1 November 2012|location=London|first=Alex|last=Needham|date=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Avedon's photo of [[Nastassja Kinski]] with a python, and Leibovitz's magazine covers of [[More Demi Moore|Demi Moore pregnant]] and in [[Demi's Birthday Suit|body paint]], have become iconic. The work of [[Joyce Tenneson]] has gone the other way, from fine art with a unique, soft-focus style showing woman at all stages of life to portraiture of famous people and fashion photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyce Tenneson|url=http://www.tenneson.com/content/bio|accessdate=2013-05-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although nude photographers have largely worked within established forms that show bodies as sculptural abstractions, some, such as [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], have created works that deliberately blur the boundaries between [[Erotic photography|erotica]] and art.

Several photographers have become controversial because of their nude photographs of underage subjects.&lt;ref name="Photo Flap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/1998/05/01/photo-flap|title=Photo Flap|publisher=Reason|year=1998|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hamilton (photographer)|David Hamilton]] often used erotic themes,&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Jock Sturges]] celebrates the beauty of people in naturist settings without emphasis on sexuality.&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock and Phillips, Jayne Anne 1991"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sturges, Jock  |author2=Phillips, Jayne Anne |lastauthoramp=yes | title=[[The Last Day of Summer (book)|The Last Day of Summer]] |publisher=Aperture |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock 1994"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sturges, Jock |title=[[Radiant Identities: Photographs by Jock Sturges]]|publisher=Aperture|year=1994|ISBN=0-89381-595-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sally Mann]] was raised in rural Virginia, in a locale were [[Nude swimming|skinny-dipping]] in a river was common, so many of her most famous photographs are of her own children swimming in the nude.&lt;ref name="Mann1992"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Mann, Sally |author2=Price, Reynolds| title=Immediate family| publisher=Aperture| year=1992| ISBN=0-89381-523-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less well-known photographers have been charged as criminals for photos of their own children.&lt;ref name="Powell, Lynn 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell|first=Lynn|title=Framing Innocence: A Mother's Photographs, a Prosecutor's Zeal, and a Small Town's Response|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWshU7qUi-0C|publisher=The New Press|year=2010|isbn=978-1-59558-626-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Body image]] has become a topic explored by many photographers working with models whose bodies do not conform to conventional prejudices about beauty.&lt;ref name="R.Michelson Galleries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmichelson.com/artist_pages/nimoy/pages/MaxBeaut.htm|title=Leonard Nimoy: The Full Body Project|publisher=R.Michelson Galleries|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Public perception===
At the beginning of the 21st century, it has become difficult to make an artistic statement in nude photography, given the proliferation of non-artistic and pornographic images which taints the subject in the perception of most viewers, limiting the opportunities to exhibit or publish the images. When they appear in mainstream consumer magazines such as ''[[Popular Photography]]'', ''PC Photo'', and ''[[Shutterbug (magazine)|Shutterbug]]''; the editors receive sufficient negative response that they tend to reject the work of serious nude-image photographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deitcher|first=Kenneth|year=2008|title=A Figure Study Workshop|journal=PSA Journal|volume=74|issue=3|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children as subjects===
Several photographers have become controversial because of their nude photographs of [[Minor (law)|underage]] subjects.&lt;ref name="Photo Flap"/&gt; [[David Hamilton (photographer)|David Hamilton]] often used erotic themes in books such as ''[[The Age of Innocence (Hamilton book)|The Age of Innocence]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Hamilton, David |title=[[The Age of Innocence (Hamilton book)|The Age of Innocence]]|publisher=Aurum Press|year=1995|ISBN=1-85410-304-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have caused controversy in both the US and the UK. [[Jock Sturges]] celebrates the beauty of people in [[Naturism|naturist]] settings&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock and Phillips, Jayne Anne 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sturges, Jock 1994"/&gt; and states that his work is not exploitative; however in 1990 the FBI raided his studio and made charges that were later dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogallery.com/Sturges_Jock/sturges-bio.html|title=Jock Sturges Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photo Lab Sets Off FBI Probe : Art: Jock Sturges' photographs of nude families are at issue|date=July 5, 1990|author=Harold Maass|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the local nature of US laws on the issue, books of both Hamilton's and Sturges' photos have been ruled obscene in the states of Alabama, South Carolina, and Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/08/news/mn-26778|title=Child Porn Fight Focuses on 2 Photographers' Books|date=March 8, 1998|author=J. R. Moehringer|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar controversy emerged in Australia in 2008 when photographs by [[Bill Henson]] were taken from an exhibit due to complaints regarding nudes of a thirteen-year-old girl, but no changes were proved.

[[Sally Mann]] was raised in rural Virginia, in a locale where [[Nude swimming|skinny-dipping]] in a river was common, so many of her most famous photographs are of her own children swimming in the nude.&lt;ref name="Mann1992" /&gt; Less well-known photographers have been charged as criminals for photos of their own children.&lt;ref name="Powell, Lynn 2010"/&gt; Some writers characterize many of these images as sexualizing children regardless of artistic merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexualizing Children: Thoughts on Sally Mann|first=Mary|last=Gordon|journal=Salmagundi|issue=111|year=1996|pages=144–145|publisher=Skidmore College|jstor=40535995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body image===
[[Body image]] has become a topic explored by many photographers working with models who do not conform to [[Norm (social)|conventional]] ideas about beauty. [[Leonard Nimoy]], after many years photographing conventionally beautiful professional models, realized that he was not capturing individual personalities, so he created a series with women interested in "[[Fat acceptance movement|Fat Liberation]]".&lt;ref name="R.Michelson Galleries"/&gt; Sally Mann's more recent nudes have been of her husband, whose body shows the effects of [[muscular dystrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sally Mann at Gagosian Gallery|last=Kuspit|first=Donald|journal=[[Artforum]]|volume=48|issue=5|date=Jan 2010|pages=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erotic art===
Many contemporary artists push the boundaries by having work with both aesthetic qualities and [[Erotic photography|explicit sexuality]]. Late in his life [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] created work that was controversial in part by being on display in Washington, DC in a gallery receiving public funds.&lt;ref name="moral"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Art and the morality of the artist|last=Bernays|first=Anne|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|volume=39|issue=20|date=Jan 20, 1993|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a Mapplethorpe retrospective opened at the Cincinnati [[Contemporary Arts Center]] in 1990, [[Dennis Barrie]] became the first American museum director to be criminally prosecuted for the contents of an [[Art exhibition|exhibition]]. Although explicit photos were placed in a separate room with a content warning, Barrie was charged with "pandering obscenity" and showing minors in a state of nudity, but a jury acquitted Barrie and the Arts Center of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ummsp.lsa.umich.edu/content/mapplethorpe-cincinnati-controversy-myth-and-legacy|title=Exhibiting Controversy: From Mapplethorpe to "Body Worlds" and Beyond|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=2013-05-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615164032/http://ummsp.lsa.umich.edu/content/mapplethorpe-cincinnati-controversy-myth-and-legacy|archivedate=2013-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] herbalists and [[Yoruba religion|priests]] enlist the aid of [[Osanyin]], the spirit of herbal medicines,&lt;ref name="Vogel 1981"&gt;{{cite book|title=[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/71017/rec/1 For spirits and kings : African art from the Paul and Ruth Tishman collection] : [Exhibition held at the Metropolitan museum of art, New York, 1981]|year=1981|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=0870992686|author=Thompson, additional research by Kate Ezra ; photographs by Jerry L.|editor=Susan Vogel}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Opa Erinle, in their work against mental and physical illness caused by malevolent forces and individuals. The Yoruba believe the power of Osanyin is vested in a wrought iron staff, called an '''Osanyin staff''', that is placed on altars to this [[Orisha]].

The staff is composed of a circle of small birds and a shaft in the middle that elevates a large bird above smaller ones. [[Babatunde Lawal]] suggests that the reason for this division could be to suggest the relaying of metaphysical powers from the celestial to the terrestrial realm. Lawal evokes the Yoruba reference to Osanyin as "The one who sees everything, like [[Olodumare]]," allowing him a vantage point from which he can protect all of humanity below.&lt;ref name=Lawal&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawal|first=Babatunde|title=Embodying the sacred in Yoruba art : featuring the Bernard and Patricia Wagner Collection|year=2007|publisher=High Museum of Art|location=Atlanta, Ga.|isbn=1932543201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The birds, emissaries of [[Ogun]], refer to the herbalist's understanding of and power over these malevolent people. There are typically sixteen birds, invoking the most sacred number of divination, surrounding and confronting the central bird, which represents the smallpox god.

[[File:Oshiguma 3-face example.1922.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an ''oshiguma'', with impressions of 3 different kumadori and autographs-inscriptions for each; created in 1922]]

An '''oshiguma''' is an impression of the [[kumadori]] (face [[make-up]]) of [[kabuki]] [[actor]]s on a piece of cloth, usually silk or cotton, created as an [[artwork]] and memento.

Oshigumas are customarily made after the performance of a kabuki play, though not necessarily after every performance, and given as highly valued [[souvenirs]] of the event.  A single oshiguma may have face-impressions from one or several actors, usually all from the same show, illustrating the make-up designs for major characters in the [[Play (theatre)|play]].  It may also include [[autograph]]s, dates and additional inscriptions; sometimes other graphic elements are added to the design.

The same term can also be used to describe an artistic depiction of kabuki make-up created by other means, but intended to emulate the appearance of a face-print.

Ege Collection of Fifty Original Manuscript Leaves]", University of South Carolina, University Libraries Digital Collections&lt;/ref&gt; was a teacher, lecturer, bookseller, and well-known book-breaker. He worked for many years at the [[Cleveland Institute of Art]] where he served as Chair of the Department of Teacher Training,&lt;ref name="shailor"&gt;"[http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/byform/mailing-lists/exlibris/2003/08/msg00147.html Barbara A.

Otto Ege's greatest fame, however, came as a result of his book-breaking. Over a period of decades in the early 20th century, Ege systematically removed the pages of some 50 [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[medieval]] manuscripts,&lt;ref name="uscleaves"/&gt; and divided them into 40 unique compilation boxes,&lt;ref name="scatteredleaves"&gt;"[http://library2.usask.ca/ege/exhibit/1.htm Scattered Leaves: the Otto Ege Medieval Manuscript Collection]", University of Saskatchewan.&lt;/ref&gt; commonly referred to as "[[Otto Ege Portfolios]]". These portfolios were in turn sold and distributed world wide.&lt;ref name="scatteredleaves"/&gt; Although strong profits were made from each sale, Ege defended his actions by stating, "Surely to allow a thousand people 'to have and to hold' an original manuscript leaf, and to get a thrill and understanding that comes only from actual and frequent contact with these art heritages, is justification enough for the scattering of fragments."&lt;ref name="porcheddu"&gt;Fred Porcheddu, "[http://www.arlisna.org/news/conferences/2006/proceedings/ses_12-porcheddu-handout2.pdf Otto F. Ege: Teacher, Collector, Biblioclast]", Art Libraries Society of North American, 6 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last several years, Prof. [[Peter Stoicheff]] of the [[University of Saskatchewan]] has been working to locate all existing Ege Portfolios, and to foster co-operation from their respective owners in creating an "Ege Medieval Manuscript Database" with the ultimate goal being the digital reconstruction of the complete books.&lt;ref name="symposium"&gt;"[http://news.usask.ca/archived_ocn/05-apr-29/news10.shtml Symposium to look at ancient pages]", University of Saskatchewan On Campus News, Volume 12, Number 17, April 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Ege's personal collection, including 50 unbroken manuscript books, was in 2015 acquired by the [[Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library]] (part of [[Yale University Library]]).&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;Mike Cummings, "[http://news.yale.edu/2015/11/15/beinecke-library-acquires-treasure-trove-medieval-manuscripts-famed-book-breaker  Beinecke Library acquires ‘treasure trove’ of medieval manuscripts from a famed ‘book breaker’]", YaleNews, November 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Performance studies''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies [[Performance (disambiguation)|performance]] and uses performance as a lens to study the world. The term 'performance' is broad, and can include artistic and aesthetic performances like concerts, theatrical events, and [[performance art]]; sporting events; social, political and religious events like rituals, ceremonies, proclamations and public decisions; certain kinds of language use; and those components of identity which require someone to do, rather than just be, something. Consequently, performance studies is interdisciplinary, drawing from theories of the performing arts, anthropology and sociology, literary theory, and legal studies.

Performance Studies has been challenged as an emerging discipline. Many academics have been critical of its instability. As an academic field it is difficult to pin down; either that is the nature of the field itself or it is still too young to tell. There are, however, numerous degree-granting programs that train researchers being offered by universities. Some have referred to it as an "inter discipline" or a "post discipline".&lt;ref&gt;Schechner, Richard. "Foreword: Fundamentals of Performance Studies," Nathan Stucky and Cynthia Wimmer, eds., ''Teaching Performance Studies,'' Southern Illinois University Press, 2002. P.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance Studies tends to concentrate on a mix of research methods. The application of practice-led or practice-based research methods has become a widespread phenomenon not just in the anglophone world. As such research projects integrate established methods like literature research and oral history with performance practice, i.e. artistic autoethnographic approaches and verbatim theatre. The documentation of ''Practice-as-Research in Performance'' (PARIP), a devoted research project conducted at the University of Bristol between 2001 and 2006, offers a number of inspiring articles and portraits of such research projects and was key for a breakthrough of using creative thinking within this subject field.&lt;ref&gt;Allegue, L., Jones, S., Kershaw, B., &amp; Piccini, A. (2009). Practice-as-Research in performance and screen. Basingstoke.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and basic concepts==

Richard Schechner author of ''Performance Studies: An Introduction'' states that Performance studies examine performances in two categories: Artistic and Cultural Performances. A. Artistic Performance are marked and understood as art. solo-performance, performance art, performance of literature, theatrical storytelling, plays, and performance poetry, This category considers performance as the art form. B. Cultural Performance includes events that occur in everyday life in which a culture values are displayed for their perpetuation: rituals such as parades, religious ceremonies, community festivals, controversial storytelling, and performances of social and professional roles, and individual performances of race, gender, sexuality and class. 

===Theatre and anthropology===
Performance Studies as an academic field has multiple origin narratives. On the theatrical and anthropological front, this origin is often regarded as the research collaborations of director [[Richard Schechner]] and anthropologist [[Victor Turner]]. This origin narrative emphasizes a definition of performance as being "between theatre and anthropology" and often stresses the importance of [[intercultural]] performances as an alternative to either traditional proscenium theatre or traditional anthropological fieldwork. [[Dwight Conquergood]] developed a branch of performance ethnography that centered the political nature of the practice and advocated for methodological dialogism from the point of encounter to the practices of research reporting. [[Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett]] has contributed an interest in tourist productions and ethnographic showmanship to the field, Judd Case has adapted performance to the study of media and religion,&lt;ref&gt;Case, J. A. "Sounds from the Center: Liriel's Performance and Ritual Pilgrimage" ''Journal of Media &amp; Religion'', October 2009, 209–225.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diana Taylor (professor)|Diana Taylor]] has brought a hemispheric perspective on Latin American performance and theorized the relationship between the [[archive]] and the performance repertoire, while Corinne Kratz developed a mode of performance analysis that emphasizes the role of multimedia communication in performance.&lt;ref&gt;Kratz, Corinne A. ''Affecting Performance: Meaning, Movement and Experience in Okiek Women's Initiation'', Smithsonian Institution Press, 1994 (new edition, Wheatmark 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Laurie Frederik argues for the importance of ethnographic research and a solid theoretical base in anthropological perspective.

===Literature===
On the literature front, Wallace Bacon (1914–2001), considered by many to be the father of performance theory, taught the performance of literature as the ultimate act of humility. In his defining statement of performance theory, "Our center is in the interaction between readers and texts which enriches, extends, clarifies, and (yes) alters the interior and even the exterior lives of students [and performers and audiences] through the power of texts" (''Literature in Performance'', Vol 5 No 1, 1984; p.&amp;nbsp;84). In addition, Robert Breen's text ''[[Chamber theatre|Chamber Theatre]]'' is a cornerstone in the field for staging narrative texts, though it remains controversial in its assertions about the place of narrative details in chamber productions. Breen is also regarded by many as a founding theorist for the discipline, along with advocate Louise Rosenblatt. More recently, performance theorist and novelist [[Barbara Browning]] has suggested that narrative fiction itself—and particularly the novel—demands the performative participation of the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Browning|first1=Barbara|title='Dear Reader': The Novel's Call to Perform|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1m4uWyRjvo|website=YouTube|publisher=The Book Lovers|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speech-act theory and 'performatives'===
An alternative origin narrative stresses the development of [[J.L. Austin|speech-act theory]] by philosophers [[J.L. Austin]] and [[Judith Butler]], literary critic [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], and also [[Shoshana Felman]]. The theory proposed by Austin in ''How To Do Things With Words''  states that "to say something ''is to do something'', or ''in'' saying something we do something, and even ''by'' saying something we do something".&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. ''How To Do Things With Words''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962. P. 94&lt;/ref&gt; the most illustrative example being "I do", as part of a marriage ceremony. For any of these performative utterances to be felicitous, per Austin, they must be true, appropriate and conventional according to those with the proper authority: a priest, a judge, or the scholar, for instance. Austin accounts for the infelicitous by noting that "there will always occur difficult or marginal cases where nothing in the previous history of a conventional procedure will decide conclusively whether such a procedure is or is not correctly applied to such a case".&lt;ref&gt;Austin, J. L. ''How To Do Things With Words''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1962. P. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of failure in performatives (utterances made with language and the body) is taken up by Butler and is understood as the "political promise of the performative".&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith. ''[[Excitable Speech : A Politics of the Performative]].'' New York: Routledge, 1997 P. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Her argument is that because the performative needs to maintain conventional power, convention itself has to be reiterated, and in this reiteration it can be expropriated by the unauthorized usage and thus create new futures. She cites Rosa Parks as an example:&lt;blockquote&gt;
When [[Rosa Parks]] sat in the front of the bus, she had no prior right to do so guaranteed by any…conventions of the South. And yet, in laying claim to the right for which she had no prior authorization, she endowed a certain authority on the act, and began the insurrectionary process of overthrowing those established codes of legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;''Excitable Speech : A Politics of the Performative.'' New York: Routledge, 1997 P. 147&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The question of the infelicitous  utterance (the misfire)is also taken up by Shoshana Felman when she states "Infelicity, or failure, is not for Austin an accident of the performative, it is inherent in it, essential to it. In other words…Austin conceives of failure not as external but as internal to the promise, as what actually constitutes it."&lt;ref&gt;Felman, Shoshana ''Scandal of the Speaking Body: Don Juan with J.L. Austin, or Seduction in Two Languages'' P. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance studies has also had a strong relationship to the fields of feminism, [[psychoanalysis]], critical race theory and [[queer theory]]. Theorists like [[Peggy Phelan]],&lt;ref&gt;Phelan, Peggy. ''Unmarked: The Politics of Performance''. London; New York: Routledge, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Esteban Muñoz]],&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, José Esteban. ''Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics''. University of Minnesota Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. Patrick Johnson]],&lt;ref&gt;E. Patrick Johnson. Appropriating Blackness: Performance and the Politics of Authenticity. Duke University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Schneider,&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Rebecca. ''The Explicit Body in Performance''. London ; New York: Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[André Lepecki]] have been equally influential in both performance studies and these related fields.

==Academic programs==
Performance studies incorporates theories of [[drama]], [[dance]], [[art]], [[anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], [[philosophy]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[comparative literature]], [[communication studies]], and increasingly, music performance.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g.
Nicholas Cook and Richard Pettengill (eds.), "Taking It to the Bridge. Music as Performance", University of Michigan Press, 2013; Nicholas Cook, "Between Process and Product: Music and/as Performance", in: [http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.01.7.2/mto.01.7.2.cook.html "The Online Journal of the Society for Music Theory", Vol. 7, No. 2, April 2001]; Philip Auslander, "Music as Performance: Living in the Immaterial World," in: [http://lmc.gatech.edu/~auslander/publications/Auslander-Immaterial.pdf "Theatre Survey", Vol. 47, No. 4, Fall 2006]"; Melanie Fritsch and Stefan Strötgen, "Relatively Live: How to Identify Live Music Performances", in: [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.5406/musimoviimag.5.1.0047?uid=3737864&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103032208791 "Music and the Moving Image", Vol. 5 No. 1, 2012 (March), p. 47–66.]&lt;/ref&gt; More can be found out by reading Schechner's book: ''Performance Studies: An Introduction'' or in D. Soyini Madison and Judith Hamera's The Sage Handbook for Performance Studies.&lt;ref&gt;Madison, D. Soyini and Judith Hamera, eds. The Sage Handbook for Performance Studies. SAGE 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The first performance studies department was created at [[New York University|NYU]]. However, there is some debate that the joint-cradles of Performance Studies are [[Northwestern University]] and NYU. For more information on the different origins and disciplinary traditions of performance studies see Shannon Jackson's book ''Professing Performance'' and the introductory chapter in Nathan Stucky and Cynthia Wimmer's ''Teaching Performance Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;Stucky, Nathan and Cynthia Wimmer, eds. ''Teaching Performance Studies.'' Southern Illinois University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the differences between the NYU and Northwestern models cite different disciplinary concerns. NYU is generally characterized as a program that pushed the definitions of theatrical practice influenced by the thearical avant-garde thus expanding its definition of what can be framed as an event. Interaction with departments that include [[New York University|NYU]]'s Postdoctoral Program in Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy have made this an ongoing pursuit. Northwestern transitioned from an elocution and performance of literature tradition to expand its definition of presentational aesthetics beyond oral interpretation. Northwestern's unique brand of performance studies has its origins in [[anthropology]], having been started by the ethnographer [[Dwight Conquergood]] with the goal of understanding all manner of local cultures through their performance practices. In both instances a focus on practice lead to a research methodology beyond theatre or literature/speech. In the United States, the interdisciplinary and multi-focus field has spread to [[Brown University|Brown]], [[University of California at Los Angeles|UCLA]], University of Northern Iowa, [[University of California at Irvine|UCI]],  [[University of California at Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], and elsewhere. Undergraduate and graduate programs are offered at [http://www.utexas.edu/finearts/tad/graduate-programs/performance-public-practice The University of Texas at Austin], [[University of California at Los Angeles|UCLA]]'s [http://www.wacd.ucla.edu/ Culture and Performance Program], [http://performancestudies.ucdavis.edu/ UC Davis], [http://drama.arts.uci.edu/graduate-programs/phd/phd-program/ UC Irvine], [[Kennesaw State University]], [[Louisiana State University]], [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]], [[California State University, Northridge]], [[San Jose State University]], [[University of San Diego]], [[University of Maryland]], the [[University of North Carolina Chapel Hill]], and [https://pad.artsci.wustl.edu/amprogram Washington University in St. Louis]. [[Texas A&amp;M University]]'s [http://performancestudies.tamu.edu/ Department of Performance Studies] is unique in including both Music and Theatre degree programs.

In the United Kingdom [[Aberystwyth University]] offers a degree scheme in performance studies with highly acclaimed performance artists such as Mike Pearson, Heike Roms and Jill Greenhalgh. The [[University of Roehampton]] in London offers a BA in Drama, Theatre and Performance Studies. [[Richmond University]], London also offers a BA in Performance and Theatre Arts. The University of Plymouth has offered a BA in Theatre &amp; Performance since the early 1990s; its postgraduate research programme (ResM and MPhil/PhD) specialises in performance studies. The [[University of Warwick]] also offers a BA in Theatre and Performance Studies, in addition to leading Postgraduate programmes.

In Denmark [[Roskilde University]] offers a master and ph.d. degree in "performance design", focusing on subjects such as theatrical performances, live music, festivals, and urban performances.

In Germany [[University of Hamburg]] offers a master program in performance studies at the centre for performance studies run by [[Gabriele Klein]]. The Centre for Performance Studies at the [[University of Bremen]] offers a certificate in performance studies focussing on the combination of academic and artistic research within performance projects.

In India, [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] offers MPhil and PhD program in Theatre &amp; Performance Studies at the School of Arts &amp; Aesthetics. Since 2012, School of Culture and Creative Expressions, [[Ambedkar University Delhi]], started a MA program in Performance Studies, which focus on redefining methodologies of cultural studies and research on the basis of the nuances of performance studies. It is formulating the first Practice based PhD in the country and working extensively in the realm of Practice-as-Research. On the similar lines, the Centre for Performance Research and Cultural Studies in South Asia (CPRACSIS), Kerala have organised series of workshops and seminars over the last few years to engage scholars, artists and practitioners in conversation informed by Performance Studies.

In Australia, the [[University of Sydney]], [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]] and [[Queensland University of Technology]] offer degrees majoring in performance studies, Honours, Masters and Phd. Performance Studies in some countries is also an A-level (AS and A2) course consisting of the integration of the discrete art forms of Dance, Music and Drama in performing arts.

In Brazil, The [[Universidade Federal de Goiás]], started an interdisciplinary program (masters) in Performances Culturais (Cultural Performances) in 2012, the first in a Latin country. The goal of this program is to analyze "rituals, games, performances, drama, dance" from a cross-cultural point of view.

'''''Plan of a Novel, according to Hints from Various Quarters''''' is a short [[satire|satirical]] work by [[Jane Austen]], probably written in May 1816.&lt;ref name="Poplawski1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Poplawski|title=A Jane Austen Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hW-OXDSc3rAC&amp;pg=PA238|accessdate=4 September 2013|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30017-2|pages=238–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in complete form for the first time by [[Robert William Chapman (scholar)|R.

==Background==
In 1815 Austen met the Rev. [[James Stanier Clarke]] in London. He had ideas for her fiction, including a novel to be based on a clergyman with a foothold in urban life, as well as the provincial rural settings she had used so far for clerics in her novels.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time (October 1815) she was staying with her brother in London negotiating the publication of ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'', which was then dedicated to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] through the good offices of Clarke, who was the Prince's librarian.&lt;ref name="Poplawski1998"/&gt; Among Clarke's suggestions was a [[historical novel]] on the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|House of Coburg]]: Austen side-stepped with a disclaimer about her talents.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Lamont, ''Jane Austen and the Old'', The Review of English Studies New Series, Vol. 54, No. 217 (Nov., 2003), pp. 661-674, at p. 663. Published by: Oxford University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3661480&lt;/ref&gt;  Clarke recommended that Austen should dedicate ''Emma ''to the Prince Regent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myer|first1=Valerie Grosvenor|title=Jane Austen : obstinate heart : a biography|date=1997|publisher=Arcade Publ.|location=New York|isbn=9781559703871|page=215|edition=1. North American}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She did this, although she disapproved of his attitude towards his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Austen wrote in a letter to Martha Lloyd on 16 February 1813 of the Prince's infidelities and his wife: "I am resolved at least always to think that she would have been respectable, if the Prince had behaved only tolerably by her at first."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and humour of the ''Plan''==
The intention of the work was to set down the essential parts of the "ideal novel". Austen was following, and guying, the recommendations of Clarke.&lt;ref name="Poplawski1998"/&gt; The work was also influenced by some of Austen's personal circle with views on the novel of [[courtship]], and names are recorded in the margins of the manuscript;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah Kaplan|title=Jane Austen Among Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wrpNvr_H0TUC&amp;pg=PA184|accessdate=4 September 2013|year=1994|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-4970-1|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; they included [[William Gifford]], her publisher, and her niece Fanny Knight.&lt;ref name="KeymerMee2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas Keymer|author2=Jon Mee|title=The Cambridge Companion to English Literature, 1740-1830|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyvdbEUGX6sC&amp;pg=PA256|accessdate=4 September 2013|date=17 June 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00757-3|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Plan'' became a sort of family joke among the Austens. Some of its aspects parody contemporary works by authors such as [[Sophie Cottin]], [[Fanny Burney]], [[Anna Maria Porter]], and [[Mary Brunton]].&lt;ref name="KeymerMee2004"/&gt; The satire of the ''Plan'' was analysed by Austen's nephew [[James Edward Austen-Leigh]], in his biography ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'' (1869, expanded edition 1871).

'''''Portrait of Charles Baudelaire''''' is a portrait of the poet [[Charles Baudelaire]] by [[Gustave Courbet]]. The artist himself dated it to 1840, but it seems to have mostly been painted around 1847, a year in which the poet and the painter met frequently. It was shown in the Courbet Pavilion at the 1855 [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]] and was bought four years later by the publisher [[Auguste Poulet-Malassis]], who then nominally sold it to [[Charles Asselineau]] on 15 June 1862 to prevent it being seized. [[Alfred Bruyas]] acquired it for 3000 francs and in 1876 gave it to the [[Musée Fabre]] in Montpellier, where it still hangs.

[[File:Gorn-1922.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Gorn'' (Furnace), an official organ of Proletkult]]
'''Proletkult''' ({{lang-rus|Пролетку́льт|p=prəlʲɪtˈkulʲt}}), a [[portmanteau]] of the Russian words "proletarskaya kultura" ([[proletarian culture]]), was an experimental Soviet artistic institution that arose in conjunction with the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917. This organization, a federation of local cultural societies and [[avant-garde]] artists, was most prominent in the visual, literary, and [[drama]]tic fields. Proletkult aspired to radically modify existing artistic forms by creating a new, revolutionary [[working class|working-class]] aesthetic, which drew its inspiration from the construction of modern industrial society in backward, agrarian Russia.

Although funded by the [[People's Commissariat for Education]] of [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]], the Proletkult organization sought autonomy from state control, a demand which brought it into conflict with the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] hierarchy and the Soviet state bureaucracy. Some top party leaders, such as [[V.I. Lenin]], sought to concentrate state funding on the basic education of the working class rather than on whimsical artistic endeavors. He and others also saw in Proletkult a hotbed of [[bourgeois]] intellectuals and potential political oppositionists.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

At its peak in 1920, Proletkult had 84,000 members actively enrolled in about 300 local studios, clubs, and factory groups, with an additional 500,000 members participating in its activities on a more casual basis.

== History ==

=== Factional background ===
[[File:A A Bogdanov.jpg|thumb|[[Bolshevik]] philosopher [[Alexander Bogdanov]], one of the founding fathers of the Proletkult movement]]

The earliest roots of the Proletarian Culture movement, better known as Proletkult, are found in the aftermath of the failed [[Revolution of 1905|1905-1907 Revolution]] against [[Nicholas II of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Mally, ''Culture of the Future: The Proletkult Movement in Revolutionary Russia.'' Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1990; pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[censorship]] apparatus of the Tsarist regime had stumbled briefly during the upheaval, broadening horizons, but the revolution had ultimately failed, resulting in dissatisfaction and second-guessing, even within [[Bolshevik Party]] ranks.

In the aftermath of the Tsar's reassertion of authority a radical political tendency known as the "[[Left Bolsheviks]]" emerged, stating their case in opposition to party leader [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].&lt;ref name=Mally4&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  This group, which included such luminaries as philosophers [[Alexander Bogdanov]] and [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] and writer [[Maxim Gorky]], argued that the [[intelligentsia]]-dominated Bolsheviks must begin following more inclusive tactics and working to develop more [[working class]] political activists to assume leadership roles in the next round of anti-Tsarist revolution.&lt;ref name=Mally4 /&gt;

Among the Left Bolsheviks, Anatoly Lunacharsky in particular had been intrigued with the possibility of making use of art as a means to inspire revolutionary political action.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, together with the celebrated Gorky, Lunacharsky hoped to found a "human religion" around the idea of [[socialism]], motivating individuals to serve a greater good outside of their own narrow self-interests.&lt;ref name=Mally5&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Working along similar lines simultaneously was Lunacharsky's brother-in-law Bogdanov, who even in 1904 had published a weighty philosophical tome called ''Empiriomonism'' which attempted to integrate the ideas of non-Marxist thinkers [[Ernst Mach]] and [[Richard Avenarius]] into the socialist edifice.&lt;ref name=Mally5 /&gt;  (Lunacharsky had studied under Avenarius in Zurich and was responsible for introducing Bogdanov to his ideas.)  Bogdanov believed that the socialist society of the future would require forging a fundamentally new perspective of the role of science, ethics, and art with respect to the individual and the state.&lt;ref name=Mally5 /&gt;

Together all these ideas of Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, Gorky, and their co-thinkers came to be known in the language of the day as "god-building" ''(bogostroitel'stvo).''&lt;ref name=Mally5 /&gt;

These ideas did not exist in a vacuum; there was a political component as well. During the period between the failure of the 1905 revolution and the outbreak of [[World War I]], Alexander Bogdanov stood as the chief rival to Lenin for leadership of the Bolshevik party.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks: Lenin and His Critics.'' Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1986; pg. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the intellectually rigid Lenin, Bogdanov was not only a political rival, but also a positive threat to the [[ideology]] of [[Marxism]]. Lenin saw Bogdanov and the "god-building" movement with which he was associated as purveyors of a reborn [[Idealism|philosophical idealism]] that stood in diametrical opposition to the fundamental [[materialism|materialist]] foundation of Marxism. So disturbed was Lenin that he spent much of 1908 combing more than 200 books to pen a thick polemical volume in reply — ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism|Materialism and Empirio-Criticism: Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy]].''&lt;ref&gt;For ''Materialism and Empirio-Criticism,'' see: V.I. Lenin, ''Collected Works: Volume 14.'' Abraham Fineberg, trans. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1962; pp. 17-361. Details of Lenin's writing process may be found in the same volume, page 366, footnote 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenin ultimately emerged triumphant in the struggle for hegemony of the Bolshevik faction. Relations between them in Western European exile remained tense. During the first decade of the 20th Century Bogdanov wrote two works of [[utopianism|utopian]] [[science fiction]] about socialist societies on [[Mars]], both of which were rejected by Lenin as attempts to smuggle "Machist idealism" into the radical movement.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pp. 169-170.&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these, a book called ''Engineer Menni'' (1913), was pronounced by Lenin to be "so vague that neither a worker nor a stupid editor at ''Pravda'' [a rival publication] could understand it."&lt;ref name=Williams170&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pg. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 Bogdanov, a student of the [[Scientific management|Taylor system]] of factory work-flow rationalization, published a massive work on the topic, ''General Organizational Science,'' which Lenin liked no better.&lt;ref name="Williams170"/&gt;

The pair went their separate ways, with Bogdanov dropping out of radical politics at the end of 1913, returning home with his wife to [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pg. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; He would later be reinvigorated by the course of events to become a leading figure in the Moscow Proletkult organization — a fact which emphasizes the tension between that organization and state authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Mally argues that this traditional emphasis on Alexander Bogdanov as the "best known leader" of Proletkult helps obscure the fact that Proletkult's ongoing battle for "autonomy" ''(samostoiatel'nost')'' was in essence a fight with the state bureaucracy rather than the Communist Party, per se. See: Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The birth of Proletkult===
[[File:Moscow SpiridonovkaStreet Morozova Palace 01-2017.jpg|thumb|right|Morozova Palace, home of Proletkult]]
====Preliminary conference====
[[File:Anatoly Lunacharsky.jpg|thumb|left|Anatoly Lunacharsky, a founding father of the Proletkult organization, was People's Commissar of Education of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1929.]]

The [[February Revolution|February Revolution of 1917]] which overthrew the Tsarist regime came comparatively easily. So, too, did the [[October Revolution]] which followed, events which overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] of [[Alexander Kerensky]] and brought Lenin and the Bolsheviks to the seat of power. The [[Russian Civil War]] was another matter altogether — a long and brutal struggle which strained every sinew.

The radical intelligentsia of Russia was mobilized by these events. Anatoly Lunacharsky, who had briefly broken with Lenin and the Bolshevik Party to become a [[newspaper correspondent]] in [[France]] and [[Italy]], returned to Russia in May 1917 and rejoined the party in August.&lt;ref name=Fitz310&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment: Soviet Organization of Education and the Arts under Lunacharsky.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1970; pg. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the October Revolution, Lunacharsky was appointed Commissar of Education of the new regime.&lt;ref name=Fitz310 /&gt;

Lunacharsky's factional ally, Alexander Bogdanov, remained sharply critical of Lenin and his political tactics and never rejoined the Communist Party, however.&lt;ref name=Fitz295&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he served at the front as a doctor during World War I, returning home to Moscow in 1917 and becoming involved there as a founder of the Proletarian Culture organization, Proletkult.&lt;ref name=Fitz295 /&gt;

The aim of unifying the cultural and educational activities of the Russian labour movements first occurred at the Agitation Collegium of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet which met on 19 July 1917 with 120 participants. It was attended by many different currents, and when the [[Menshevik]] Dementiev suggested that the meeting just be confined to public lectures and that the [[Bolsheviks]] should be excluded, but this was soundly rejected. Consequently, the Central Council of [[Factory committee|Factory Committee]]s was instructed to work with the [[Petrograd Soviet]] to organise a second conference of "proletarian cultural-educational organizations" to bring them together in a centralized organization.&lt;ref name=Fitz89&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; A first conference of these groups was held in [[Petrograd]] from October 16 to 19, 1917 &lt;small&gt;(O.S.)&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name=Fitz89 /&gt; The conclave was called by Lunacharsky in his role as head of the Cultural-Educational Commission of the Petrograd Bolshevik organization and was attended by 208 delegates representing Petrograd trade unions, factory committees, army and youth groups, city and regional dumas, as well as the Petrograd Committee of the Bolshevik and [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Socialist-Revolutionary]] parties.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pp. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

This October 1917 conference elected a Central Committee of Proletarian Cultural-Educational Organizations of Petrograd which included among its members Lunacharsky, Lenin's wife [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]], talented young journalist [[Larisa Reisner]], and a long-time [[Vpered]] associate of Bogdanov and Lunacharsky named [[Fedor Kalinin]], among others.&lt;ref name=Fitz90&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Also playing a key role was [[Pavel Lebedev-Polianskii]], another former member of Bogdanov and Lunacharsky's émigré political group.&lt;ref name=Fitz306&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these would be catapulted into leading roles in the People's Commissariat of Education following the Bolshevik seizure of power which followed less than two weeks later.&lt;ref name=Fitz90 /&gt;

====After the Bolshevik seizure of state power====

Nikitin, Vasili Ignatov Standing from left to right: [[Stefan Krivtsov]], [[Karl Ozol-Prednek]], Anna Dodonova, N. M. Vasilevskii, [[Vladimir Kirillov]]]]
The October Revolution led to a marked increase in the number of new cultural organizations and informal groups.&lt;ref name=Mally33&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Clubs and cultural societies sprung up affiliated with newly empowered factories, unions, cooperatives, and [[soviet (council)|workers' and soldiers' councils]], in addition to similar groups attached to more formal institutions such as the [[Red Army]], the Communist Party, and [[Komsomol|its youth section]].&lt;ref name=Mally33 /&gt; The new government of Soviet Russia was quick to understand that these rapidly proliferating clubs and societies offered a potentially powerful vehicle for the spread of the radical political, economic, and social theories it favored.&lt;ref name=Mally33 /&gt;

The chief cultural authority of the Soviet state was its People's Commissariat of Education ([[Narkompros]]), a bureaucratic apparatus which quickly came to include no fewer than 17 different departments.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Headed by Anatoly Lunacharsky, this organization sought to expand adult literacy and to establish a broad and balanced general school curricula, in opposition to pressure from the trade unions and the [[Supreme Council of National Economy]], which sought to give preference to [[vocational education]].&lt;ref name=Mally35&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The as-yet loosely organized Proletkult movement emerged as another potential competitor to the primacy of Narkompros.

This confusing welter of competing institutions and organizations was by no means unique to the cultural field, as historian Lynn Mally has noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"All early Soviet institutions struggled against what was called 'parallelism,' the duplication of services by competing bureaucratic systems. The revolution raised difficult questions about governmental organization that were only slowly answered during the first years of the regime. Political activists disputed the authority of the central state, the role of the Communist Party within it, and the influence national agencies should wield over local groups. Altercations over scarce resources and institutional authority were intertwined with theoretical debates over the ideal structure of the new policy."&lt;ref name=Mally34&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, in the early revolutionary period control over local institutions by the central government of the Soviet state was weak, with factory workers often ignoring their trade unions and teachers the curriculum instructions of central authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt; In this political environment any centrally-devised scheme for a division of authority between Narkompros and the federated artistic societies of Proletkult remained largely a theoretical exercise. In the early days of the Bolshevik regime the local apparatus of Proletkult retained the most powerful hand.&lt;ref name=Mally36&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With its adherent Anatoly Lunacharsky at the helm of Narkompros, the Proletkult movement had an important patron with considerable influence over state policy and the purse. This did not mean an easy relationship between these institutions, however. Early in 1918 leaders of Petrograd Proletkult refused to cooperate with an effort by Narkompros to form a citywide theatre organization, declaring their refusal to work with non-proletarian theatre groups.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moscow Proletkult, in which Alexander Bogdanov played a leading role, attempted to extend its independent sphere of control even further than the Petrograd organization, addressing questions of food distribution, hygiene, vocational education, and issuing a call for establishment of a proletarian university at its founding convention in February 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Some hardliners in the Proletkult organization even insisted that Proletkult be recognized as the "ideological leader of all public education and enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;Vasilii Ignatov, writing in ''Griadushchee'' (The Future) 1918, no. 4 (April 1918), pg. 15. Quoted in Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, however, the vision of Proletkult as the rival and guiding light of Narkompros fell by the wayside, subdued by the Proletkult's financial reliance on the Commissariat for operational funding.&lt;ref name=Mally44&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Proletkult received a budget of 9.2 million gold rubles for the first half of 1918 — nearly one-third of the entire budget for Narkompros's Adult Educational Division.&lt;ref name=Mally44 /&gt; Requisitioned buildings were put to the organization's use, with the Petrograd organization receiving a large and posh facility located on one of the city's main thoroughfares, [[Nevsky Prospect]] — the name of which was actually changed to "Proletkult Street" ''(Ulitsa Proletkul'ta)'' in the organization's honor.&lt;ref name=Mally44 /&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Plakat mayakowski gross.jpg|thumb|The poet as graphic artist: "proletarian art" in a civil war era poster by the [[Russian futurism|futurist]] poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], published by Narkompros. Mayakovsky makes use of stencil, simple agitational poetry, and primitive workerist graphics to create an almost [[folk art]] effect.]]

While the Proletkult movement began as independent groups in Petrograd (October 1917) and Moscow (February 1918), it was not long before the group's patrons in the Soviet state intervened to help forge a national organization.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet government itself moved from Petrograd to Moscow in March 1918 and the center of Proletkult's own organizational gravity shifted simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Mally45&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lines became blurred between the Proletkult organization and the Division for Proletarian Culture of the People's Commissariat of Education, headed by Proletkult activist Fyodor Kalinin.&lt;ref name=Mally45 /&gt; While the organization retained its staunch supporters in the Narkompros apparatus seeking to coordinate activities, it also contained no small number of activists like Alexander Bogdanov who tried to promote the organization as an independent cultural institution with a homogeneous working class constituency.&lt;ref name=Mally45 /&gt;

In September 1918 the first national conference of Proletkult was convened in Moscow, including 330 delegates and 234 guests from local organizations from around Soviet Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; While no delegate list has survived, the stenogram of the conference indicates that the bulk of attendees hailed from trade unions, factory organizations, cooperatives, and workers' clubs.&lt;ref name=Mally46&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates were split between those favoring an autonomous and leading role for the organization in general education in Soviet society and those who favored a more narrow focus for the group as a subordinate part of the Narkompros bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

While those favoring autonomy were in the majority at the first national conference, the ongoing problem of organizational finance remained a real one, as historian Lynn Mally has observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Although the Proletkult was autonomous, it still expected Narkompros to foot the bills. The government would supply the central Proletkult with a subsidy, to be distributed among provincial affiliates. But because financial dependence on the state clearly contradicted the organization's claims to independence, the central leaders held out the hope that their affiliates would soon discover their own means of support."&lt;ref name=Mally48&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proletkult and its desire for autonomy also had another powerful patron in the person of [[Nikolai Bukharin]], editor of ''[[Pravda]].''&lt;ref name=Fitz94&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Bukharin provided favorable coverage for Proletkult during the organization's formative period, welcoming the idea that the group represented a "laboratory of pure proletarian ideology" with a legitimate claim to independence from Soviet governmental control.&lt;ref name=Fitz94 /&gt;

Proletkult made use of different organizational forms. In large industrial cities, the organization set up an elaborate bureaucratic apparatus resembling that of Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Fitz98&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow Proletkult, for example, had departments for literary publishing, theatre, music, art, and clubs.&lt;ref name=Fitz98 /&gt; In addition to this central bureaucracy, Proletkult established factory cells attached to the highly concentrated mills and manufacturing facilities.&lt;ref name=Fitz98 /&gt; Finally, Proletkult established "studios" — independent facilities in which workers learned and developed the techniques of the various arts.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narkompros, for its part, sought to influence Proletkult to concentrate its efforts upon the expansion of the network of studios.&lt;ref name=Fitz99&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1919 People's Commissar of Education Lunacharsky declared that Proletkult "should concentrate all its attention on studio work, on the discovery and encouragement of original talent among the workers, on the creation of circles of writers, artists, and all kinds of young scholars from the working class..."&lt;ref&gt;A. Lunacharsky, "Once Again on Proletkult and Soviet Cultural Organizations," ''Izvestiia VTsIK,'' No. 80 (April 13, 1919), pg. 2. Quoted in Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proletkult and its studios and clubs gained a certain measure of popularity among a broad segment of the urban Russian population, particularly factory workers.&lt;ref name=Siegelbaum&gt;Lewis H. Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1992; pg. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1918 the organization counted 147 local affiliates, although the actual number of functioning units was probably somewhat fewer.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 51. See especially footnote 57 on that page.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peak of the organization's strength in 1920, Proletkult claimed a total of 84,000 members in 300 local groups, with an additional 500,000 more casual followers.&lt;ref&gt;Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929,'' pp. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 15 different Proletkult periodicals were produced over the course of the organization's short existence,&lt;ref name=Maguire157&gt;Robert A. Maguire, ''Red Virgin Soil: Soviet Literature in the 1920s.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1968; pg. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; including most importantly ''Proletarskaia kultura'' (Proletarian Culture — 1918 to 1921) and ''Gorn'' (Furnace — 1918 to 1923).&lt;ref&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/litenc/encyclop/le9/le9-5192.htm "Пролеткульт,"] (Proletkult). Fundamental Electronic Library of Russian Literature and Folklore, feb-web.ru/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideology===

Historically the relationship between the Russian liberal [[intelligentsia]] and the working class was that of teacher and student.&lt;ref name=CultFront19&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''The Cultural Front: Power and Culture in Revolutionary Russia.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1992; pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This situation presumed a "higher" level of culture on the part of the aristocratic teachers — an accepted premise of the Bolsheviks themselves during the pre-revolutionary period.&lt;ref name=CultFront19 /&gt;

Under Marxist theory, however, culture was conceived as a part of the [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] associated with the dominant class in society — in the Russian instance, that of the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref name=CultFront20&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Cultural Front,'' pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Under a workers' state, some [[theoretician (Marxism)|Marxist theoreticians]] believed, the new proletarian ruling class would develop its own distinct class culture to supplant the former culture of the old ruling order.&lt;ref name=CultFront20 /&gt; Proletkult was seen as a primary vehicle for the development of this new "proletarian culture."

The nature and function of Proletkult was described by [[Platon Kerzhentsev]], one of the movement's top leaders in 1919:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The task of the 'Proletkults' is the development of an independent proletarian spiritual culture, including all areas of the human spirit — science, art, and everyday life. The new socialist epoch must produce a new culture, the foundations of which are already being laid. This culture will be the fruit of the creative efforts of the working class and will be entirely independent. Work on behalf of proletarian culture should stand on a par with the political and economic struggle of the working class.

"But in creating its own culture, the working class by no means should reject the rich cultural heritage of the past, the material and spiritual achievements, made by classes which are alien and hostile to the proletariat. The proletarian must look it over critically, choose what is of value, elucidate it with his own point of view, use it with a view to producing his own culture. *  *  *

"This work on a new culture ought to proceed along a completely independent path. 'Proletkults' should be class-restricted, workers' organizations, completely autonomous in their activities."&lt;ref&gt;V. Kerzhentsev, ''Oktiabr'skii perevorot i diktatura proletariata'' (The October Overturn and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat). Moscow: 1919;  pp. 154-161. Reprinted in William G. Rosenberg (ed.), ''Bolshevik Visions: First Phase of the Cultural Revolution in Soviet Russia.'' Second Edition. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 1990; pp. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proletkult's theorists generally espoused a hardline [[economic determinism]], arguing that only purely working class organizations were capable of advancing the cause of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; An early editorial from the official Proletkult journal ''Proletarskaia Kultura'' (Proletarian Culture) demanded that "the proletariat start right now, immediately, to create its own ''socialist forms of thought, feeling, and daily life,'' independent of alliances or combinations of political forces."&lt;ref&gt;"From the Editors," ''Proletarskaia Kul'tura,'' 1918, no. 3 (March 1918), pg. 36. Emphasis in original. Quoted in Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of Alexander Bogdanov and other Proletkult theoreticians, the arts were not the province of a specially gifted elite, but rather were the physical output of individuals with a set of learned skills.&lt;ref name=Maguire157 /&gt; All that was required, it was assumed, was for one to study basic artistic technique in a very few lessons, after which anyone was capable of becoming a proletarian artist.&lt;ref name=Maguire157 /&gt; The movement by Proletkult to establish a network of studios in which workers could enroll was seen as an essential part of training this new cohort of proletarian artists.&lt;ref name=Maguire157 /&gt;

Despite the organization's rhetoric about its proletarian exclusivity, however, the movement was guided by intellectuals throughout its entire brief history, with its efforts to promote workers from the bench to leadership positions largely unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929,'' pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on the various arts===

====Literature====

Proletkult expended great energy in attempting to launch a wave of worker-poets, with only limited artistic success. The insistence upon developing new poets of questionable talent led to a split of the Proletkult in 1919, when a large group of young writers, most of whom were poets, broke from the organization due to what they believed to be a stifling of individual creative talent.&lt;ref name=Maguire158&gt;Maguire, ''Red Virgin Soil,'' pg. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

These defectors from Proletkult initially formed a small, elite organization called Kuznitza (The Forge) before again launching a new [[mass organization]] known as the [[All-Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]] (VAPP) a year later.&lt;ref name=Maguire158 /&gt;

====Theater====
{{main|Proletcult Theatre}}
The Proletkult organizations of Petrograd and Moscow controlled their own dramatic theatrical network, including under its umbrella a number of smaller city clubs maintaining their own theatrical studios.&lt;ref name=Acts31&gt;Lynn Mally, ''Revolutionary Acts: Amateur Theater and the Soviet State, 1917-1938.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2000; pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrograd Proletkult opened a large central studio early in 1918 which staged a number of new and experimental works with a view to inspiring similar performances in other amateur theaters around the city.&lt;ref name=Acts31 /&gt; Moscow Proletkult opened its own central theater several months later.&lt;ref name=Acts31 /&gt;

Proletkult constituted the leading center of a radical minority within the theatrical community of the day which aspired to promote so-called "proletarian theater."&lt;ref name=Acts22&gt;Mally, ''Revolutionary Acts,'' pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Development of this new form was defined in one early conference resolution as "the task of workers themselves, along with those peasants who are willing to accept their ideology."&lt;ref name=Acts22 /&gt; Conventional modes of performance were discouraged, in favor of unconventional stagings designed to promote "mass action" — including public processions, festivals, and social dramas.&lt;ref name=Acts22 /&gt;

===Contemporary criticism===

Artists in the Proletkult movement, while not by any means a homogeneous bloc, were influenced to a great extent by the [[iconoclasm]], technological orientation, and revolutionary enthusiasm bound up in the thematic movements of the day, [[Russian futurism|futurism]] and [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]].&lt;ref name=Fitz100&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite lip service paid to classical forms of poetry, drama, writing, sculpture, and painting, strong encouragement was given to the use of new techniques and forms in so-called "proletarian art," including the use of photography, cinematography, and collage.&lt;ref name=Fitz100 /&gt;

This commitment to experimentalism drew the fire of those party leaders who preferred more classical modes of artistic expression. Petrograd Communist Party leader [[Grigory Zinoviev]]  took the lead at a conference of "proletarian writers" held in that city in the fall of 1919, declaring that while previously "we allowed the most nonsensical futurism to get a reputation almost as the official school of Communist art" and let "doubtful elements attach themselves to our Proletkults."&lt;ref name=Zin&gt;Quoted in Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; it was henceforth "time to put an end to this," Zinoviev demanded.&lt;ref name=Zin /&gt;

Also among those critical of the Proletkult movement and its vision to create a wholly new proletarian culture was top Soviet party leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]. At a public speech in May 1919 Lenin declared any notions of so-called "proletarian culture" to be "fantasies" which he opposed with "ruthless hostility."&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Lenin, ''Polnoe sobranie sochineniia: Tom 38, Mart—Iiun' 1919.'' Moscow: Politizdat, 1969; pp. 368-369. Quoted in Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, Lenin had profound misgivings about the entire institution of Proletkult, viewing it as (in historian [[Sheila Fitzpatrick|Sheila Fitzpatrick's]] words) "an organization where futurists, idealists, and other undesirable bourgeois artists and intellectuals addled the minds of workers who needed basic education and culture..."&lt;ref name=CultFront22&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Cultural Front,'' pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin also may have had political misgivings about the organization as a potential base of power for his long-time rival [[Alexander Bogdanov]] or for ultra-radical [[Left communism|"Left Communists"]] and the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] dissidents who comprised the [[Workers' Opposition]].&lt;ref name=CultFront22 /&gt;

===Dissolution===
[[File:Vintage Potemkin.jpg|thumb|The ethic of Proletkult is found in the early cinematic works of Sergei Eisenstein. This promotional poster for his 1926 film ''The Battleship Potemkin'' making use of indistinct masses of people and diagonal lines is exemplary of [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]].]]

By the fall of 1920 it became increasingly clear that the Soviet regime would emerge from the Russian Civil War victorious. With fall of the [[White movement|Whites]], a common enemy which united disparate factions around the Soviet banner, much unity was loosened. Dissident groups such as the so-called Workers' Opposition and the [[Group of Democratic Centralism|Democratic Centralists]] emerged in the Communist Party, widespread dissatisfaction among the [[peasantry]] over forced grain requisitioning resulted in isolated uprisings. All of these factors prompted a wave of debate about the institutions that had sprung up in Soviet society during wartime, including Proletkult.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its short history, Proletkult had sought both autonomy from state control and hegemony in the cultural field. This had created a substantial number of critics and rivals. These included leaders of the Soviet trade union movement, who saw the management of workers' cultural opportunities as part of their own purview; local Communist Party committees, which sought centralization under their own direction rather than a hode-podge of autonomous civic institutions; and the People's Commissariat of Education (Narkompros), which believed its own mission included the cultural training of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, Narkompros proved the most outspoken and unyielding in its criticism.&lt;ref name=Mally197&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since 1918 [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]] — the wife of Vladimir Lenin — had sought to reign in Proletkult and integrate it under the agency in which she herself played a leading role, the Adult Education Division of Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Mally197 /&gt; A May 1919 conference of adult education workers had, spurred on by Krupskaya, determined that Proletkult was an adult education agency owing to its studio system, and therefore rightfully part of Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Mally197 /&gt;

Bureaucratic wrangling between top leaders of Proletkult and the Adult Education Division of Narkompros had produced a working agreement in the summer of 1919 bringing Proletkult formally under the auspices of the latter, albeit with its own separate budget.&lt;ref name=Mally198&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; This proved, however, to be a stop-gap and institutional conflict remained.&lt;ref name=Mally198 /&gt;

Proletkult leaders subsequently made an effort to expand their movement on an international basis at the [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern|2nd World Congress of the Communist International]] in August 1920, founding [[Kultintern]], an international organization headed by Anatoly Lunacharsky.&lt;ref name=Mally200&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; The group's grandiose vision and practical efforts to expand the Proletkult movement globally was particularly concerning to Lenin, himself a man of staid and traditional cultural tastes who had already come to see Proletkult as utopian and wasteful.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 199, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurred to action by Lenin, in the fall of 1920 the governing Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) &lt;!---this is the correct name and capitalization for the organization---&gt; began to take an active interest in the relationship of Proletkult with other Soviet institutions for the first time.&lt;ref name=Mally198 /&gt; Lenin sought and obtained information from [[M. N. Pokrovsky|M.N. Pokrovsky]], second in command at Narkompros, and top Proletkult leaders about the organization's budget and semi-independent status and pushed through a decision to absorb Proletkult into Narkompros to end the situation of parallelism once and for all.&lt;ref name=Mally201&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

The already scheduled National Congress of Proletkult, held in Moscow from October 5 to 12, 1920, was to be the occasion for the announcement.&lt;ref name=Mally201 /&gt; While Lunacharsky, head of Narkompros but a patron of Proletkult and its interests, dragged his feet on the merger, the congress eventually — following long debate and a stern appeal to party discipline — formally approved the Central Committee's decision to directly integrate Proletkult into Narkompros.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The integration was not a smooth one, however, and Proletkult activists fought to the last ditch to retain organizational autonomy even within Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Mally203&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Committee reacted with a scathing decree denouncing Proletkult that was published in ''Pravda'' on December 1, 1920.

===Legacy===

Despite its formal termination as an organization, the Proletkult movement continued to influence and inform early Soviet culture. Historian Peter Kenez has noted the heavy influence of the Proletkult ethic in the work of pioneer Soviet filmmaker [[Sergei Eisenstein]], director of the classic films ''[[Strike (1925 film)|Strike]]'' (1925), ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1926), and ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World]]'' (1927):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The intellectual content of [Eisenstein's] early films was profoundly influenced by his earlier association with Proletkult, a complex politicocultural movement that reached the height of its influence during the revolutionary period.... [Its leaders] argued that the new, socialist culture would be profoundly different from what it replaced. In their view there could be no accommodation with the old world; the proletariat on the basis of its experience would create a new culture that would reflect the spirit of the collective. It followed that the new art had to emphasize not the accomplishments of individuals but those of the workers and peasants. Eisenstein was attracted to this movement because it justified the necessity of a complete break with the art of the '[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]' world. All of his early films expressed, though in his own idiom, the ideology of Proletkult."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kenez, ''Cinema and Soviet Society, 1917-1953.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992; pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Richard Cardinal: Cry from a Diary of a Métis Child''''' is a 1986 [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentary film by [[Alanis Obomsawin]], about the suicide of [[Métis]] youth Richard Stanley Cardinal, who killed himself in 1984 at the age of 17. Cardinal, who had been placed in 28 different homes during his 14 years in [[Alberta]]'s child welfare system, hanged himself from a cross bar he had nailed between two trees near his last foster home, northwest of [[Edmonton]].&lt;ref name=Henton&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Thirty+years+later+little+done+address+suicide+rate+among+aboriginal+teens+care/9212389/story.html|title=Thirty years later, little done to address suicide rate among aboriginal teens in care|last=Henton|first=Darcy|date=8 January 2014|work=Calgary Herald|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The film makes use of Cardinal's remembrances from his diary, and helped to change public perceptions in Canada around the treatment of children in the foster care system.&lt;ref name=berlinale&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2013/02_programm_2013/02_Filmdatenblatt_2013_20130655.php#tab=filmStills|title=Richard Cardinal: Cry from a Diary of a Métis Child|work=2013 Archives|publisher=[[Berlin International Film Festival]]|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal was born in [[Fort Chipewyan]]. Because of alcoholism in his family, the children were separated from their parents. The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] moved the children to [[Fort McMurray]] where they were given different foster parents, with Richard and his older brother Charlie housed together for the first while—where a litany of physical and mental abuse began.&lt;ref name="Auger"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ammsa.com/publications/windspeaker/nfb-films-reveal-sad-tales-foster-children|title=NFB films reveal sad tales of foster children|last=Auger|first=Josie|volume=7 |issue=22 |date=1990|work=Windspeaker|publisher=[[Aboriginal Multi-Media Society]]|page=10|accessdate=21 September 2014|location=Edmonton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obomsawin offers Cardinal's life story as an expression of the plight of "15,000 native children [who] are wards of the provinces." Cardinal recollections of abuse at his first foster home placement at age six, when he and his older brother were whipped with their pants down in front of the three daughters of his foster family. It quotes Cardinal's brother as stating, "What Richard needed most was to go home. His funeral was the best social service that was provided for Richard, because it finally brought his family together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J. Low|first=Brian|title=NFB Kids: Portrayals of Children by the National Film Board of Canada, 1939-1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VdOhE8nISuMC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=%22Richard+Cardinal:+Cry+from+a+Diary+of+a+M%C3%A9tis+Child%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sDcfVLmoE8WWyASUrYCoBQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Richard%20Cardinal%3A%20Cry%20from%20a%20Diary%20of%20a%20M%C3%A9tis%20Child%22&amp;f=false|date=22 February 2002|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|isbn=0889203865|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also made the film for other children: "I want people who look at the film to have a different attitude next time they meet what is called a 'problem child', and develop some love and some relationship to the child -- instead of alienating him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allioff|first1=Maurie|last2=Levine|first2=Susan Schouten|title=Interview: The Long Walk of Alanis Obomsawin|journal=Cinema Canada|date=June 1987|issue=142|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inquiries==
His death sparked a provincial government inquiry, which offered 22 recommendations for improving how courts, the provincial government, schools, hospitals, aboriginal organizations and media deal with foster children—including recommendations that have been repeated at subsequent inquiries following Aboriginal youth deaths. However, a January 2014 article in the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' reported that such recommendations, which are neither binding on the government nor tracked for implementation, have largely been ignored.&lt;ref name=Henton/&gt;

==Retrospectives==
In recent years, ''Richard Cardinal: Cry from a Diary of a Métis Child'' has been featured in retrospectives at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/film_screenings/5157|title=FILM SCREENINGS|year=2008|work=Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]] (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotdocs.ca/media/press_releases/hot_docs_2009_honours_canadian_filmmaker_alanis_obomsawin_with_outstanding_|title=HOT DOCS 2009 HONOURS CANADIAN FILMMAKER ALANIS OBOMSAWIN WITH OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT AWARD|date=24 March 2009|work=Press release|publisher=Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival]|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] (2013).&lt;ref name=berlinale/&gt;

The '''Schnütgen Museum''' ('''Museum Schnütgen''' in German) in [[Cologne]] (Köln), [[Germany]] is devoted to Christian religious art, mainly [[medieval art|medieval]], but some parts of the collection, such as its [[textile]]s and prints, extend from [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]] to the modern period.  In 1906, the collection of Alexander Schnütgen was donated to the city, and the collection has continued to expand, so that until the opening of a new building in 2010, only about 10% of its 13,000 items could be displayed. Now some 2,000 objects are on display in 1900 sq. metres of gallery space, with an additional 1300 sq. metres for special exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museenkoeln.de/museum-schnuetgen/default.asp?s=1920&amp;tid=253&amp;kontrast=&amp;schrift= Museum website, English page], accessed May 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Schnütgen (1843–1918) was a Catholic priest and theologian;&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Alexander Schnütgen|Biography on German Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; according to the museum website "Up to now people tell stories about his zealous and sometimes crafty collection tactics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museenkoeln.de/english/default.asp?s=254&amp;tid=125&amp;kontrast=&amp;schrift= Museums of Cologne Art of the Middle Ages Museum Schnütgen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227223813/http://www.museenkoeln.de/english/default.asp?s=254&amp;tid=125&amp;kontrast=&amp;schrift= |date=2009-12-27 }}. Museums of Cologne. Accessed January 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1956, the museum has occupied the large [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church of [[St. Cäcilien]], founded in 881 for noble canonesses, with the present building dating from 1130–60, with murals from about 1300.  An annex built by architect [[Karl Band]] was added in the 1950s, and new buildings (part of the ''Kulturquartier, “Culture quarter“'') opened in 2010. Highlights of the collection include a Romanesque [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] from St Cecilia's itself, several large wooden [[crucifix]]es, including the 11th century ''Cross of St George's'', as well as a large collection of early bronze ones, including the only other work generally attributed to [[Rainer of Huy]] apart from his [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège|Liège baptismal font]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasko, 181&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum has a late Carolingian [[evangeliary]] of 860–880, and a single leaf from the English [[St Albans Psalter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museenkoeln.de/museum-schnuetgen/default.asp?s=967&amp;tid=188&amp;kontrast=&amp;schrift= Museum highlights 2nd and 4th items - Handschriften und Einzelblätter].

Alexander Schnütgen had organised influential exhibitions of his collection while it was still private, and from the 1970s the museum (using extra exhibition spaces) organized a series of landmark exhibitions of medieval art:

* ''Rhein und Maas'' (1972, [[Mosan art]])
* ''Monumenta Annonis – Köln und Siegburg. Weltbild und Kunst im hohen Mittelalter'' (1975)
* ''Die [[Peter Parler|Parler]] und der [[International Gothic|schöne Stil]] 1350–1400, Europäische Kunst unter [[House of Luxembourg|den Luxemburgern]]'' (1978)
* ''Ornamenta Ecclesia – Kunst und Künstler der Romanik '' (1985, Romanesque metalwork and other church art)
* ''Himmelslicht. Europäische Glasmalerei im Jahrhundert des Kölner Dombaus (1248–1349)'' (1998, [[stained glass]]).

The enormous catalogues for these exhibitions, some running to three volumes, remain important works of reference. Catalogues of the permanent collection of the museum are being published in several volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museenkoeln.de/museum-schnuetgen/default.asp?s=514&amp;tid=162&amp;kontrast=&amp;schrift= Museum website Bestandskatalog]. Accessed January 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; A touring exhibition in America of objects from the museum in 2000 also produced a catalogue in English.

Tolkien]]'s ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' series, a variety of independent bookstores specializing in science fiction, fantasy, horror, and related genres (often mystery, comics, games, and/or collectibles), began opening.&lt;ref name="bdp1008"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ken |last=Bullock |work=The Berkeley Daily Planet |title=The Other Change of Hobbit is Living in South Berkeley |url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2010-08-10/article/36052?headline=The-Other-Change-of-Hobbit-Thrives-in-South-Berkeley |date=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first were [[Bakka-Phoenix Bookstore]] in Toronto and [[A Change of Hobbit]] in Southern California, both established in 1972.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6784">[[File:Son et lumière sound and light show at Giza.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Sound and light show at [[Giza, Egypt]]]]

'''''Son et lumière''''' {{IPA-fr|sɔ̃n e lymjɛʁ}} (French, lit. "sound and light"), or a '''sound and light show''', is a form of nighttime entertainment that is usually presented in an outdoor venue of historic significance.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |title=son et lumière |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/554172/son-et-lumiere |accessdate=30 March 2010 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Special [[lighting]] effects are projected onto the façade of a building or [[ruin]] and synchronized with recorded or live [[narration]] and music to dramatize the history of the place.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;  The invention of the concept is credited to Paul Robert-Houdin, who was the [[curator]] of the [[Château de Chambord]] in France, which hosted the world's first ''son et lumière'' in 1952.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;  Another was established in the early 1960s at the site of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in Egypt.

This nighttime medium naturally lends itself to ecclesiastical buildings, stately homes and ruins,{{Citation needed|date=March 2010|reason=The unattributed claim that the nighttime "naturally lends itself..." gives the impression of being an original claim (see "Wikipedia:No original research") in the absence of a reference.}} and has rapidly become very popular in France where about 50 annual productions take place,&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt; principally in the [[Loire Valley]], at the [[Palace of Versailles]] and at [[Les Invalides]] in Paris.

The format usually involves no active participation by actors but a recorded narrative of the history of the building concerned by one or a cast of voices. To this is added music or [[sound effect]]s as appropriate, all of which is synchronised to lighting and/or projection effects which provide the visual dimension. [[Pyrotechnic]] effects are occasionally included for added spectacle.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;

A relatively recent variation is that, rather than the music and narration coming through a concert-like sound system, they may use [[Headset (audio)|headsets]], such as in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania's "Lights of Liberty". This allows an audience to move through a historic district as the show proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitphilly.com/history/philadelphia/lights-of-liberty/ Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102130036/http://www.visitphilly.com/history/philadelphia/lights-of-liberty/ |date=2011-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performances around the world==

In France, ''son et lumière'' shows are performed in and around France's historical [[château]]x. 

In neighboring [[Luxembourg]], a ''son et lumière'' event took place in 2007 at the Chateau de Septfontaines. 

In other countries, ''son et lumière'' has been mounted at the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] in Rome and at the [[Parthenon]] in Athens. 

In the United States, the first such presentation took place at [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]] in 1962. Another presentation took place at George Washington's [[Mount Vernon]] in May 1976 as France's bicentennial gift to the United States. The opening performance was attended by French President [[Giscard d'Estaing]] and American President [[Gerald Ford]].

Further afield, the first African production was at the [[Pyramids of Giza]] at [[Cairo]], Egypt, in 1961, while the first in Asia was the [[Red Fort]] in [[Delhi]], India in 1965 by the [[India Tourism Development Corporation]]. 

[[Canterbury Cathedral]] in England featured a ''son et lumière'' in 1965 and more recently in 2005, along with [[Rochester Cathedral]] and [[Rochester Castle|Castle]] as part of the European "Cathedrales en Lumière" project.

In Britain, where the majority of such productions have been staged at churches, [[cathedral]]s and [[abbey]]s, indoor presentations are frequently preferred, particularly as architectural gems might otherwise not be shown to best advantage.  The first British production was at [[Greenwich Palace]] in south London in 1957. In England in particular, where ''son et lumière'' is as well received as it is in France, many of the nations's principal historic houses and church buildings have enjoyed such a production.  Of particular interest have been the ones at [[Canterbury Cathedral]] (produced as part of the European "Cathedrales en Lumière" events), [[Rochester Castle]], [[St Augustine's Abbey]], [[St. George's Hall, Liverpool]], [[Tewkesbury Abbey]], [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Hampton Court Palace]], and at [[Chartwell]], the country home of [[Winston Churchill]]. Part of the [[London 2012 Olympic bid]] involved the use of ''son et lumière'' inspired light projections of [[sportsperson|athletes]] upon various London buildings. 

In [[India]], popular shows are at [[Red Fort]], [[Amer Fort]], [[Akbari Quila]], [[Ajmer]], [[Jantar Mantar, Jaipur]], [[Purana Qila, Delhi]], and [[Golconda Fort]]. In [[Peru]], a ''son et lumière'' show opened in [[Park of the Reserve]], Lima in 2007, called "Circuito Mágico del Agua" (''magic water circuit'') which has a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness record]] as the world's largest water source exposed in a public park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amarengo.org/articulos/circuito Circuito Mágico del Agua] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212205457/http://amarengo.org/articulos/circuito |date=2010-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Canada, the [[National Capital Commission]] has sponsored a sound and light show on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]] every year since 1984, from early July to mid-September.

In Australia, ''Blood Under the Southern Cross'', shown at [[Sovereign Hill]] in [[Ballarat]] since 1992, depicts the events of the 1854 [[Eureka Rebellion]].

In Israel, a son et lumière production is presented both at the [[Tower of David]] in the Citadel of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]], and at the desert butte of [[Masada]]. 

Composers who have produced son et lumière shows include [[Jacqueline Nova]] and [[Halim El-Dabh]]. French electronic music composer [[Jean Michel Jarre]] has incorporated son et lumière productions into his live concerts, which often take place outdoors at historical sites, sometimes with more than one million spectators.

'''Spontaneous symmetry breaking''' is a [[spontaneous process]] of [[symmetry breaking]], by which a physical system in a [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetric]] state ends up in an asymmetric state.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir A. Miransky, ''Dynamical Symmetry Breaking in Quantum Field Theories''. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=UOpY9kmL3YQC&amp;pg=PA15 15].  {{ISBN|9810215584}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterns of Symmetry Breaking. Edited by Henryk Arodz, Jacek Dziarmaga, Wojciech Hubert Zurek. Pg  [https://books.google.com/books?id=uF1P7cFFsNMC&amp;pg=PA141 141].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bubbles, Voids and Bumps in Time: The New Cosmology. Edited by James Cornell. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=vRIs8mY1yZcC&amp;pg=PA125 125].&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it can describe systems where the [[equations of motion]] or the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] obey symmetries, but the lowest-energy [[vacuum solution]]s do not exhibit that same [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]]. When the system goes to one of those vacuum solutions, the symmetry is broken for perturbations around that vacuum even though the entire Lagrangian retains that symmetry.

==Overview==

In [[explicit symmetry breaking]], if we consider two outcomes, the probability of a pair of outcomes can be different.  By definition, spontaneous symmetry breaking requires the existence of a symmetric probability distribution—any pair of outcomes has the same probability.  In other words, the underlying laws{{clarify|date=December 2016}} are [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] under a [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] transformation.

The system, as a whole{{clarify|date=December 2016}}, changes under such transformations.

Phases of matter, such as crystals, magnets, and conventional superconductors, as well as simple phase transitions can be described by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Notable exceptions include topological phases of matter like the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]].

==Examples==

===Mexican hat potential===
[[Image:Mexican hat potential polar.svg|270px|thumb|Graph of Goldstone's "Mexican hat" potential function &lt;math&gt;V(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.]]

Consider a symmetric upward dome with a trough circling the bottom. If a ball is put at the very peak of the dome, the system is symmetric with respect to a rotation around the center axis.  But the ball may ''spontaneously break'' this symmetry by rolling down the dome into the trough, a point of lowest energy. Afterward, the ball has come to a rest at some fixed point on the perimeter.  The dome and the ball retain their individual symmetry, but the system does not.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald M. Edelman, Bright Air, Brilliant Fire: On the Matter of the Mind (New York: BasicBooks, 1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NGIIGZmarOAC&amp;pg=PA203 203].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest idealized relativistic model, the spontaneously broken symmetry is summarized through an illustrative [[scalar field theory]]. The relevant [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] of a scalar field &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, which essentially dictates how a system behaves, can be split up into kinetic and potential terms,
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \partial^\mu \phi \partial_\mu \phi - V(\phi).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

It is in this potential term &lt;math&gt;V(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; that the symmetry breaking is triggered. An example of a potential, due to [[Jeffrey Goldstone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Goldstone | first1 = J. | doi = 10.1007/BF02812722 | title = Field theories with " Superconductor " solutions | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento | volume = 19 | pages = 154–164 | year = 1961 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1961NCim...19..154G }}&lt;/ref&gt; is illustrated in the graph at the right.
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;V(\phi) = -10|\phi|^2 + |\phi|^4 \,&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

This potential has an infinite number of possible [[minimum|minima]] (vacuum states) given by
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\phi = \sqrt{5} e^{i\theta} &lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
for any real ''θ'' between 0 and 2''π''. The system also has an unstable vacuum state corresponding to {{nowrap|1=''Φ'' = 0}}. This state has a [[Unitary group|U(1)]] symmetry. However, once the system falls into a specific stable vacuum state (amounting to a choice of ''θ''), this symmetry will appear to be lost, or "spontaneously broken".

In fact, any other choice of ''θ'' would have exactly the same energy, implying the existence of a massless [[Goldstone boson|Nambu–Goldstone boson]], the mode running around the circle at the minimum of this potential, and indicating there is some memory of the original symmetry in the Lagrangian.

===Other examples===
* For [[ferromagnet]]ic materials, the underlying laws are invariant under spatial rotations. Here, the order parameter is the [[magnetization]], which measures the magnetic dipole density. Above the [[Curie temperature]], the order parameter is zero, which is spatially invariant, and there is no symmetry breaking. Below the Curie temperature, however, the magnetization acquires a constant nonvanishing value, which points in a certain direction (in the idealized situation where we have full equilibrium; otherwise, translational symmetry gets broken as well). The residual rotational symmetries which leave the orientation of this vector invariant remain unbroken, unlike the other rotations which do not and are thus spontaneously broken.
* The laws describing a solid are invariant under the full [[Euclidean group]], but the solid itself spontaneously breaks this group down to a [[space group]]. The displacement and the orientation are the order parameters.
* General relativity has a Lorentz symmetry, but in [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FRW cosmological models]], the mean 4-velocity field defined by averaging over the velocities of the galaxies (the galaxies act like gas particles at cosmological scales) acts as an order parameter breaking this symmetry. Similar comments can be made about the cosmic microwave background.
* For the [[electroweak]] model, as explained earlier, a component of the Higgs field provides the order parameter breaking the electroweak gauge symmetry to the electromagnetic gauge symmetry. Like the ferromagnetic example, there is a phase transition at the electroweak temperature. The same comment about us not tending to notice broken symmetries suggests why it took so long for us to discover electroweak unification.
* In superconductors, there is a condensed-matter collective field ψ, which acts as the order parameter breaking the electromagnetic gauge symmetry.
* Take a thin cylindrical plastic rod and push both ends together. Before buckling, the system is symmetric under rotation, and so visibly cylindrically symmetric. But after buckling, it looks different, and asymmetric. Nevertheless, features of the cylindrical symmetry are still there: ignoring friction, it would take no force to freely spin the rod around, displacing the ground state in time, and amounting to an oscillation of vanishing frequency, unlike the radial oscillations in the direction of the buckle. This spinning mode is effectively the requisite [[Goldstone boson|Nambu–Goldstone boson]].
* Consider a uniform layer of [[fluid]] over an infinite horizontal plane. This system has all the symmetries of the Euclidean plane. But now heat the bottom surface uniformly so that it becomes much hotter than the upper surface. When the temperature gradient becomes large enough, [[convection cell]]s will form, breaking the Euclidean symmetry.
* Consider a bead on a circular hoop that is rotated about a vertical [[diameter]]. As the [[rotational velocity]] is increased gradually from rest, the bead will initially stay at its initial [[equilibrium point]] at the bottom of the hoop (intuitively stable, lowest [[gravitational potential]]). At a certain critical rotational velocity, this point will become unstable and the bead will jump to one of two other newly created equilibria, [[equidistant]] from the center. Initially, the system is symmetric with respect to the diameter, yet after passing the critical velocity, the bead ends up in one of the two new equilibrium points, thus breaking the symmetry.

==Spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics==
[[File:Spontaneous symmetry breaking (explanatory diagram).png|thumb|right|250px|''Spontaneous symmetry breaking illustrated'': At high energy levels (''left'') the ball settles in the center, and the result is symmetric. At lower energy levels (''right''), the overall "rules" remain symmetric, but the symmetric  "[[sombrero|Mexican hat]]" enforces an asymmetric outcome, since eventually the ball must rest at some random spot on the bottom, "spontaneously", and not all others.]]

===Particle physics===
In [[particle physics]] the [[force carrier]] particles are normally specified by field equations with [[gauge symmetry]]; their equations predict that certain measurements will be the same at any point in the field. For instance, field equations might predict that the mass of two quarks is constant. Solving the equations to find the mass of each quark might give two solutions. In one solution, quark A is heavier than quark B. In the second solution, quark B is heavier than quark A ''by the same amount''. The symmetry of the equations is not reflected by the individual solutions, but it is reflected by the range of solutions.

An actual measurement reflects only one solution, representing a breakdown in the symmetry of the underlying theory. "Hidden" is a better term than "broken", because the symmetry is always there in these equations. This phenomenon is called [[Spontaneous magnetization|''spontaneous'']] symmetry breaking (SSB) because ''nothing'' (that we know of) breaks the symmetry in the equations.&lt;ref name="Weinberg2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Weinberg|title=Dreams of a Final Theory: The Scientist's Search for the Ultimate Laws of Nature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rsg3PE_9_ccC|date=20 April 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-78786-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|194–195}}

====Chiral symmetry====
{{Main article|Chiral symmetry breaking}}
Chiral symmetry breaking is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking affecting the [[chiral symmetry]] of the [[strong interactions]] in particle physics. It is a property of [[quantum chromodynamics]], the [[quantum field theory]] describing these interactions, and is responsible for the bulk of the mass (over 99%) of the [[nucleons]], and thus of all common matter, as it converts very light bound [[quarks]] into 100 times heavier constituents of [[baryons]]. The approximate [[Nambu–Goldstone boson]]s in this spontaneous symmetry breaking process are the [[pions]], whose mass is an order of magnitude lighter than the mass of the nucleons. It served as the prototype and significant ingredient of the Higgs mechanism underlying the electroweak symmetry breaking.

====Higgs mechanism====
{{Main article|Higgs mechanism|Yukawa interaction}}

The strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces can all be understood as arising from [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]]. The [[Higgs mechanism]], the spontaneous symmetry breaking of gauge symmetries, is an important component in understanding the [[superconductivity]] of metals and the origin of particle masses in the standard model of particle physics. One important consequence of the distinction between true symmetries and ''gauge symmetries'', is that the spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry does not give rise to characteristic massless Nambu–Goldstone physical modes, but only massive modes, like the plasma mode in a superconductor, or the Higgs mode observed in particle physics.

In the standard model of particle physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking of the {{nowrap|SU(2) × U(1)}} gauge symmetry associated with the electro-weak force generates masses for several particles, and separates the electromagnetic and weak forces. The [[W and Z bosons]] are the elementary particles that mediate the [[weak interaction]], while the [[photon]] mediates the [[electromagnetic interaction]]. At energies much greater than 100 GeV all these particles behave in a similar manner. The [[Unified field theory#Modern progress|Weinberg–Salam theory]] predicts that, at lower energies, this symmetry is broken so that the photon and the massive W and Z bosons emerge.&lt;ref&gt;A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking, Bantam; 10th anniversary edition (September 1, 1998). pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, fermions develop mass consistently.

Without spontaneous symmetry breaking, the [[Standard Model]] of elementary particle interactions requires the existence of a number of particles. However, some particles (the [[W and Z bosons]]) would then be predicted to be massless, when, in reality, they are observed to have mass. To overcome this, spontaneous symmetry breaking is augmented by the [[Higgs mechanism]] to give these particles mass. It also suggests the presence of a new particle, the [[Higgs boson]], detected in 2012.

[[Superconductivity]] of metals is a condensed-matter analog of the Higgs phenomena, in which a condensate of Cooper pairs of electrons spontaneously breaks the U(1) gauge symmetry associated with light and electromagnetism.

===Condensed matter physics===
Most phases of matter can be understood through the lens of spontaneous symmetry breaking. For example, crystals are periodic arrays of atoms that are not invariant under all translations (only under a small subset of translations by a lattice vector). Magnets have north and south poles that are oriented in a specific direction, breaking [[rotational symmetry]]. In addition to these examples, there are a whole host of other symmetry-breaking phases of matter including nematic phases of liquid crystals, charge- and spin-density waves, superfluids and many others.

There are several known examples of matter that cannot be described by spontaneous symmetry breaking, including: topologically ordered phases of matter like [[Fractional quantum Hall effect|fractional quantum Hall liquids]], and [[Quantum spin liquid|spin-liquids]]. These states do not break any symmetry, but are distinct phases of matter. Unlike the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, there is not a general framework for describing such states.&lt;ref name=chen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = Xie | authorlink3 = Xiao-Gang Wen | last2 = Gu | first2 = Zheng-Cheng | last3 = Wen | first3 = Xiao-Gang | year = 2010 | title = Local unitary transformation, long-range quantum entanglement, wave function renormalization, and topological order | journal = Phys.

====Continuous symmetry====
The ferromagnet is the canonical system which spontaneously breaks the continuous symmetry of the spins below the [[Curie temperature]] and at {{nowrap|1=''h'' = 0}}, where ''h'' is the external magnetic field. Below the [[Curie temperature]] the energy of the system is invariant under inversion of the magnetization ''m''('''x''') such that {{nowrap|1=''m''('''x''') = −''m''(−'''x''')}}. The symmetry is spontaneously broken as {{nowrap|''h'' → 0}} when the Hamiltonian becomes invariant under the inversion transformation, but the expectation value is not invariant.

Spontaneously-symmetry-broken phases of matter are characterized by an order parameter that describes the quantity which breaks the symmetry under consideration. For example, in a magnet, the order parameter is the local magnetization.

Spontaneously breaking of a continuous symmetry is inevitably accompanied by gapless (meaning that these modes do not cost any energy to excite) Nambu–Goldstone modes associated with slow long-wavelength fluctuations of the order parameter. For example, vibrational modes in a crystal, known as phonons, are associated with slow density fluctuations of the crystal's atoms. The associated Goldstone mode for magnets are oscillating waves of spin known as spin-waves. For symmetry-breaking  states, whose order parameter is not a conserved quantity, Nambu–Goldstone modes are typically massless and propagate at a constant velocity.

An important theorem, due to Mermin and Wagner, states that, at finite temperature, thermally activated fluctuations of Nambu–Goldstone modes destroy the long-range order, and prevent spontaneous symmetry breaking in one- and two-dimensional systems. Similarly, quantum fluctuations of the order parameter prevent most types of continuous symmetry breaking in one-dimensional systems even at zero temperature (an important exception is ferromagnets, whose order parameter, magnetization, is an exactly conserved quantity and does not have any quantum fluctuations).

Other long-range interacting systems such as cylindrical curved surfaces interacting via the [[Coulomb potential]] or [[Yukawa potential]] has been shown to break translational and rotational symmetries.&lt;ref&gt;

===Dynamical symmetry breaking===
Dynamical symmetry breaking (DSB) is a special form of spontaneous symmetry breaking where the ground state of the system has reduced symmetry properties compared to its theoretical description ([[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]).

Dynamical breaking of a global symmetry is a spontaneous symmetry breaking, that happens not at the (classical) tree level (i.e. at the level of the bare action), but due to quantum corrections (i.e. at the level of the [[effective action]]).

Dynamical breaking of a gauge symmetry {{ref|note1}} is subtler. In the conventional spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, there exists  an unstable [[Higgs particle]] in the theory, which drives the vacuum to a symmetry-broken phase (see e.g. [[Electroweak interaction]]). In dynamical gauge symmetry breaking, however, no unstable Higgs particle operates  in the theory, but the bound states of the system itself provide the unstable fields that render the phase transition. For example, Bardeen, Hill, and Lindner published a paper which attempts to replace the conventional [[Higgs mechanism]] in the [[standard model]], by a DSB that is driven by a bound state of top-antitop quarks (such models, where a composite particle plays the role of the Higgs boson, are often referred to as "Composite Higgs models").&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamical breaking of gauge symmetries is often due to creation of a [[fermionic condensate]]; for example the [[quark condensate]], which is connected to the [[Chiral symmetry breaking|dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry]] in [[quantum chromodynamics]]. Conventional [[superconductivity]] is the paradigmatic example from the condensed matter side, where phonon-mediated attractions lead electrons to become bound in pairs and then condense, thereby breaking the electromagnetic gauge symmetry.

==Generalisation and technical usage==
For spontaneous symmetry breaking to occur, there must be a system in which there are several equally likely outcomes. The system as a whole is therefore [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetric]] with respect to these outcomes. However, if the system is sampled (i.e. if the system is actually used or interacted with in any way), a specific outcome must occur. Though the system as a whole is symmetric, it is never encountered with this symmetry, but only in one specific asymmetric state. Hence, the symmetry is said to be spontaneously broken in that theory. Nevertheless, the fact that each outcome is equally likely is a reflection of the underlying symmetry, which is thus often dubbed "hidden symmetry", and has crucial formal consequences. (See the article on the [[Nambu–Goldstone boson|Goldstone boson]].)

When a theory is symmetric with respect to a [[symmetry group]], but requires that one element of the group be distinct, then spontaneous symmetry breaking has occurred. The theory must not dictate ''which'' member is distinct, only that ''one is''. From this point on, the theory can be treated as if this element actually is distinct, with the proviso that any results found in this way must be resymmetrized, by taking the average of each of the elements of the group being the distinct one.

The crucial concept in physics theories is the [[order parameter]]. If there is a field (often a background field) which acquires an expectation value (not necessarily a [[vacuum expectation value|''vacuum'' expectation value]]) which is not invariant under the symmetry in question, we say that the system is in the [[ordered phase]], and the symmetry is spontaneously broken. This is because other subsystems interact with the order parameter, which specifies a "frame of reference" to be measured against. In that case, the [[vacuum state]] does not obey the initial symmetry (which would keep it invariant, in the linearly realized  '''Wigner mode''' in which it would be a singlet), and, instead changes under the (hidden) symmetry, now implemented in the (nonlinear) '''Nambu–Goldstone mode'''. Normally, in the absence of the Higgs mechanism, massless [[Goldstone boson]]s arise.

The symmetry group can be discrete, such as the [[space group]] of a crystal, or continuous (e.g., a [[Lie group]]), such as the rotational symmetry of space. However, if the system contains only a single spatial dimension, then only discrete symmetries may be broken in a [[vacuum state]] of the full [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], although a classical solution may break a continuous symmetry.

==Nobel Prize==
On October 7, 2008, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] awarded the 2008 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] to three scientists for their work in subatomic physics symmetry breaking. [[Yoichiro Nambu]], of the [[University of Chicago]], won half of the prize for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in the context of the strong interactions, specifically [[chiral symmetry breaking]]. Physicists [[Makoto Kobayashi (physicist)|Makoto Kobayashi]] and [[Toshihide Maskawa]], of [[Kyoto University]], shared the other half of the prize for discovering the origin of the [[Explicit symmetry breaking|explicit breaking]] of CP symmetry in the weak interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Nobel Foundation|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2008|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/index.html|work=nobelprize.org|accessdate=January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This origin is ultimately reliant on the Higgs mechanism, but, so far understood as a "just so" feature of Higgs couplings, not a spontaneously broken symmetry phenomenon.

'''Textile arts''' are [[art]]s and [[craft]]s that use [[fiber crop|plant]], [[animal fiber|animal]], or [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] [[fiber]]s to construct practical or decorative objects.

[[Textile]]s have been a fundamental part of human life since the beginning of [[civilization]].&lt;ref name="GW"&gt;Gillow, John, and Bryan Sentance: ''World Textiles'', p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Women"&gt;Barber, Elizabeth Wayland: ''Women's Work: The First 20,000 Years'', p. 42-70&lt;/ref&gt; The methods and materials used to make them have expanded enormously, while the functions of textiles have remained the same. The history of textile arts is also the history of [[international trade]].  [[Tyrian purple]] [[dye]] was an important trade good in the ancient [[Mediterranean]]. The [[Silk Road]] brought [[China|Chinese]] silk to [[India]], [[Africa]], and [[Europe]]. Tastes for imported luxury [[fabric]]s led to [[sumptuary law]]s during the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]].  The [[Industrial Revolution]] was shaped largely by innovation in textiles technology: the [[cotton gin]], the [[spinning jenny]], and the [[power loom]] mechanized production and led to the [[Luddite]] rebellion.

==Concepts==
The word ''textile'' is from [[Latin]] ''texere'' which means "to weave", "to braid" or "to construct".&lt;ref name="GW" /&gt; The simplest textile art is [[felt]]ing, in which animal fibers are matted together using heat and moisture.  Most textile arts begin with  twisting or [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[plying]] fibers to make [[yarn]] (called ''thread'' when it is very fine and ''[[rope]]'' when it is very heavy). The yarn is then [[macrame|knotted]], [[Loop (knot)|looped]], [[braid]]ed, or [[weaving|woven]] to make flexible ''fabric'' or ''cloth'', and cloth can be used to make [[clothing]] and soft furnishings.  All of these items &amp;ndash; felt, yarn, fabric, and finished objects &amp;ndash; are collectively referred to as ''textiles''.&lt;ref&gt;Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: ''Textiles''&lt;/ref&gt;

The textile arts also include those techniques which are used to embellish or decorate textiles &amp;ndash; [[dyeing]] and [[textile printing|printing]] to add [[color]] and pattern; [[embroidery]] and other types of [[needlework]]; [[tablet weaving]]; and [[lace]]-making.  Construction methods such as [[sewing]], [[knitting]], [[crochet]], and [[tailoring]], as well as the tools employed ([[loom]]s and [[sewing needle]]s), techniques employed ([[quilting]] and [[pleat]]ing) and the objects made ([[carpet]]s, [[kilim]]s, [[rug hooking|hooked rugs]], and [[woven coverlet|coverlets]]) all fall under the category of textile arts.

==Functions==

From early times, textiles have been used to cover the human body and protect it from the elements; to send [[social interaction|social cues]] to other people; to store, secure, and protect possessions; and to soften, insulate, and decorate living spaces and surfaces.&lt;ref name="Cambridge intro"&gt;''Cambridge History of Western Textiles'', p. 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The persistence of ancient textile arts and functions, and their elaboration for decorative effect, can be seen in a [[Jacobean era]] portrait of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]] by [[Robert Peake the Elder]] (&lt;small&gt;above&lt;/small&gt;). The prince's [[capotain]] [[hat]] is made of felt using the most basic of textile techniques. His clothing is made of woven cloth, richly embroidered in [[silk]], and his [[stocking]]s are knitted. He stands on an [[oriental rug]] of [[wool]] which softens and warms the floor, and heavy [[curtain]]s both decorate the room and block cold drafts from the window. [[Goldwork (embroidery)|Goldwork embroidery]] on the [[tablecloth]] and curtains proclaim the status of the home's owner, in the same way that the felted fur hat, sheer [[linen]] [[shirt]] trimmed with [[reticella]] lace, and opulent embroidery on the prince's clothes proclaim his social position.&lt;ref&gt;For general discussion of textile techniques in this era and their significance, see Janet Arnold, ''Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd'' and ''Patterns of Fashion: the cut and construction of clothes for men and women 1560–1620'', as well as Karen Hearn, editor, ''Dynasties: Painting in Tudor and Jacobean England 1530–1630'', throughout.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textiles as art==
Traditionally the term ''art'' was used to refer to any skill or mastery, a concept which altered during the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] period of the nineteenth century, when art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science".&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, Ernst. "[http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 Press statement on The Story of Art]".

Natural fibers have been an important aspect of human society since 7000 B.C.,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1533/9780857095503.1|title=Introduction to natural textile fibres|last=kozłowski|first=R.M.|last2=Mackiewicz-Talarczyk|first2=M.|pages=1–8|doi=10.1533/9780857095503.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is suspected that they were first used in ornamental cloths since 400 B.C. in India where cotton was first grown.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015006754272|title=The textile arts, a handbook of fabric structure and design processes:ancient and modern weaving, braiding, printing, and other textile techniques.|last=Birrell|first=Verla Leone|date=1959|publisher=New York,}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural fibers have been used for the past 4000 to 5000 years to make cloth, and plant and animal fibers were the only way that clothing and fabrics could be created up until 1885 when the first synthetic fiber was made.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cotton and flax are two of the most common natural fibers that are used today, but historically natural fibers were made of most parts of the plant, including bark, stem, leaf, fruit, seed hairs, and sap.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Flax ===
[[File:Mummy Cloth Fragment MET 43868.jpg|thumb|Linen cloth that was used in mummification.]]
Flax is believed to be the oldest fiber that was used to create textiles, as it was found in the tombs of mummies from as early as 6500 B.C.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maier|first=Ursula|last2=Schlichtherle|first2=Helmut|date=2011-11-01|title=Flax cultivation and textile production in Neolithic wetland settlements on Lake Constance and in Upper Swabia (south-west Germany)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00334-011-0300-8|journal=Vegetation History and Archaeobotany|language=en|volume=20|issue=6|pages=567–578|doi=10.1007/s00334-011-0300-8|issn=0939-6314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fibers from the flax are taken from the filaments in the stem of the plant, spun together to create long strands, and then woven into long pieces of linen that were used from anything from bandages to clothing and tapestries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Each fiber's length depends on the height of the leaf that it is serving, with 10 filaments in a bundle serving each leaf on the plant. Each filament is the same thickness, giving it a consistency that is ideal for spinning yarn.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The yarn was best used on warping boards or warping reels to create large pieces of cloth that could be dyed and woven into different patterns to create elaborate tapestries and embroideries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  One example of how linen was used is in the picture of a bandage that a mummy was wrapped in, dated between 305 and 30 B.C. Some of the bandages were painted with hieroglyphs if the person being buried was of importance to the community.

=== Cotton ===
[[File:Fustat Indian.jpg|thumb|Cotton tapestry that was woven into an intricate pattern in India]]
Cotton was first used in 5000 B.C. in India and the Middle East, and spread to Europe after they invaded India in 327 B.C. The manufacture and production of cotton spread rapidly in the 18th century, and it quickly became one of the most important textile fibers because of its comfort, durability, and absorbency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cotton fibers are seed hairs formed in a capsule that grows after the plant flowers. The fibers complete their growth cycle and burst to release about 30 seeds that each have between 200 and 7000 seed hairs that are between 22 and 50 millimeters long. About 90% of the seed hairs are cellulose, with the other 10% being wax, pectate, protein, and other minerals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Once it is processed, cotton can be spun into yarn of various thicknesses to be woven or knitted into various different products such as velvet, chambray, corduroy, jersey, flannel, and velour that can be used in clothing tapestries, rugs, and drapes, as shown in the image of the cotton tapestry that was woven in India.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Plant fiber identification in ancient textiles ==
Light microscopy, normal transmission electron microscopy, and most recently scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used to study ancient textile remains to determine what natural fibers were used to create them.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryder|first=M. L.|last2=Gabra-Sanders|first2=Thea|date=1985|title=The Application of Microscopy to Textile History|url=https://doi.org/10.1179/004049685793701061|journal=Textile History|volume=|pages=123–140|via=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once textiles are found, the fibers are teased out using a light microscope and an SEM is used to look for characteristics in the textile that show what plant it is made of.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In flax, for example, scientists look for longitudinal striations that show the cells of the plant stem and cross striations and nodes that are specific to flax fibers. Cotton is identified by the twist that occurs in the seed hairs when the fibers are dried to be woven.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This knowledge helps us to learn where and when the cultivation of plants that are used in textiles first occurred, confirming the previous knowledge that was gained from studying the era in which different textile arts aligned with from a perspective of design.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Future of plants in textile art ==
While plant use in textile art is still common today, there are new innovations being developed, such as Suzanne Lee's art installation “BioCouture.” Lee uses fermentation to create a plant-based paper sheet that can be cut and sewn just like cloth- ranging in thickness from thin plastic-like materials up to thick leather-like sheets.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hemmings|first=Jessica|date=2008|title=Grown Fashion: Animal, Vegetable or Plastic?|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/175183508X377627|journal=The Journal of Cloth and Culture|volume=|pages=262–273|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garments are “disposable” because they are made entirely of plant based products and are completely biodegradable. Within her project, Lee places a large emphasis on making the clothing look fashionable by using avant-garde style and natural dyes made from fruits because compostable clothing is not appealing to most shoppers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, there is a possibility to create designs with the plants by tearing or cutting the growing sheet and allowing it to heal to create a pattern made of scars on the textile.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The possibilities to use this textile in art installations is incredible because artists would have the ability to create a living art piece, such as Lee does with her clothing.

==Plot summary==
Between the summer of 1979 and the spring of 1981, 29 African American children, adolescents and adults were murdered in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The killings gained nationwide attention, with many suspecting that they were the work of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] or a similar [[white supremacist]] group. However, in June 1981, a 23-year-old African American named [[Wayne Williams]] (Levels) was arrested for [[first-degree murder]] in the deaths of 27-year-old Nathaniel Carter and 29-year-old Jimmy Ray Payne.  Eight months later, Williams was convicted of both killings and sentenced to two consecutive terms of [[life imprisonment]].  Some parties speculate that Williams was not the real killer, and that local law enforcement officials used him as a [[Scapegoat#Metaphor|scapegoat]] to bring a seemingly unsolvable case to a close.  However, it is generally presumed that Williams was the culprit in most of the murders, if not all of them. No one was ever tried in connection with the other killings.

==Reception==
*Atlanta officials criticized ''The Atlanta Child Murders'', claiming that it distorted the facts of the case. After a series of negotiations, CBS executives agreed to insert a disclaimer alerting viewers that the film is based on fact but contains fictional elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''''The Heroic Slave, a heartwarming Narrative of the Adventures of Madison Washington, in Pursuit of Liberty''''' is a short piece of fiction written by notable [[abolitionist]] [[Frederick Douglass]], at the time a fugitive slave based in Boston. When the Rochester Ladies' Anti Slavery Society asked Douglass for a short story to go in their collection, ''Autographs for Freedom'', Douglass responded with ''The Heroic Slave''. The novella, published in 1852 by [[John P. Jewett]] and Company, was Douglass' first and only published work of fiction (though he did publish several autobiographical narratives).

''The Heroic Slave'' is a fictional work inspired by [[Madison Washington]], an enslaved cook on the brig ''[[Creole case|Creole]],'' who led a rebellion on the ship by 19 slaves in November 1841. They succeeded in taking control of the ship en route from Virginia to New Orleans (in what was known as the [[coastwise slave trade]]), and ordered it sailed to Nassau in the Bahamas. A total of 135 slaves gained freedom there, as Britain had abolished slavery in 1839. It was the largest and most successful slave rebellion in United States history.&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite news

Part I opens as Madison Washington carries a heavy load through the woods, lamenting his condition under slavery. Mr. Listwell, a free white man, secretly watches him in silence.

In Part II, the story moves ahead five years. Mr. Listwell is sitting at the table with his wife when they hear a knock at the door. Madison Washington is running from slavery, and Mr. Listwell is more than willing to help him escape. As they talk, Mr. Listwell tells Madison he remembers him from so many years before, and asks him where he has been all of this time. Madison reveals that on the day Mr. Listwell saw him, he left his wife and children to escape and seek freedom. Unable to find his way to the North, a week later he returned to his plantation. He met with his wife who regularly gave him food and provision, and for five years hid in the woods. However, a great fire caused Madison to lose his hiding place, which is why he ran to see Mr. Listwell. Mr. Listwell gives Madison a new coat and provisions and helps him escape to Canada.

In Part III, Mr. Listwell is in a tavern and reveals that he has traveled 40 miles that day. As he drinks, he sees a slave-gang on their way to market, and is surprised to see Madison Washington among the slaves. Madison reveals that he reached Canada, but he missed his wife so much that he returned to the United States to help her escape. He reached her bedroom window, but he scared her so much that he woke up her master. The couple were chased by the master and his dogs. His wife was shot down and killed and he had been sold to traders who would take him to the Deep South. Mr. Listwell realizes there's nothing he can do for Madison in these conditions, but implores the man to put his trust in God. As he is leaving, Mr. Listwell buys 3 files; he gives them and $10 secretly to Madison. Part III ends with Madison taken aboard a ship, put in chains together with other slaves, and sailing to the South for re-sale.

In Part IV, white men speak about "unfortunate" events that occurred aboard the ship ''[[Creole case|Creole]]''. Madison Washington gained the trust of all of the overseers on board and, using the files Mr. Listwell had given him, cuts through his fetters and leads the slaves in rebellion. Nineteen slaves survived the battle. Madison took over as captain of the ship, ordering it sailed to Nassau, in the British colony of the Bahamas. Britain had abolished slavery there in 1834. In Nassau, a group of black soldiers declared that they only protected property, and people were not property, so the nineteen slaves were freed.

In 1993, Ossie Mills began working at The Inspiration Network&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tulsaworld.com/article.aspx/New_ORU_exec_plans_to_enhance_television_operations/20110910_18_a15_cutlin739715&lt;/ref&gt; as The Vice President of Programming, Production and On Air Promotion. He was heavily involved in the production of original series and made for TV specials, many of which earn multiple awards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delirious.org.uk/document.php?id=508&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped with the acquisition of off network series and the brand development of the on air packaging of the network.

In 2003, Mills returned to The Inspiration Network as its Executive Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-110362090.html&lt;/ref&gt; He led both the domestic and international network under Inspiration Networks to drastically grow in the area of Non-Profit mission advancement.

=== Production facilities ===
The original facilities for producing the networks were relocated in the 1990s from [[Heritage USA]] in [[Fort Mill, South Carolina]] to a newly constructed production studio and headquarters in a business park in Charlotte, North Carolina.

In 2003, the [[Lancaster County, South Carolina|Lancaster County]] Economic Development Corp. found the network some undeveloped property in the unincorporated area called [[Indian Land, South Carolina|Indian Land]], in that county. The network applied for state relocation incentives, saying it would bring several hundred employees to a campus it called "City of Light", where it would combine its nonprofit enterprise with for-profit businesses. The state agreed to give the network tax credits worth at least $3.6 million over 15 years. In 2006, the state agreed to fund $1.2 million of improved road access to the campus. The network also got $560,000 through a program that allows state utility fees to be used for infrastructure improvements.&lt;ref name="Promises-26May09"/&gt;

In the fall of 2008, the State of South Carolina rejected the network's request for tax-exempt status. The rejection means that the network's land, buildings and equipment will all be taxed.&lt;ref name="TaxBreak-18Jun09"/&gt;

As of mid-2009, about 200 of the company's 330 employees work at the site. Only two of nine promised projects have been completed or even started.  Construction on condominiums, supposed to begin in July 2008, is now "long into the future" due to the effects of decreased giving and economic decline.&lt;ref name="Promises-26May09"&gt;{{cite news |title=Religious network promises, fails to deliver the goods; Experts say S.C. made costly mistakes when it gave millions in incentives; for-profit projects in doubt |author=Ames Alexander |date= May 26, 2009 |url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/774/story/745484.html |work=Charlotte Observer }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*"Inspiration Global", which provides broadband video content to non-English speaking audiences.&lt;ref name="PR-20May09"/&gt;

== Financials ==
Throughout most of the 1990s, the network did not ask for donations on the air, unlike many other religious TV stations. Instead, it generated revenue by selling advertising and airtime for programs produced by other ministries. In 1999, the network began soliciting donations from the public. That year, gifts were about $200,000. By 2008, they were about $40 million.&lt;ref name="Surging-23May09"/&gt;

In 2007, the network's revenues were more than $69 million. Profits between 2002 and 2006 totaled $39 million.&lt;ref name="TaxBreak-18Jun09"&gt;{{cite news |title=Christian television network denied tax break |date=June 18, 2009 |author=Dave Wagner |publisher=WCNC.com NewsChannel 36 |url=http://www.wcnc.com/news/topstories/stories/wcnc-061809-al-christian_network.712374.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, chief executive [[David Cerullo]], Morris Cerullo's son, was paid more than $1.5 million, making him the best-paid leader of any religious charity tracked by watchdog groups.&lt;ref name="Surging-23May09"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/408/story/741812.html |title=Surging ministry, growing questions |work=Charlotte Observer |date= May 23, 2009 |author=Ames Alexander and Tim Funk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Cerullo was paid $1,677,399.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Donovan|first=Doug|title=CEOs won 3% Pay Raises in 2012, and Bigger Gains Unlikely Soon|newspaper=The Chronicle of Philanthropy|date=2013-09-26|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife Barbara was paid $150,000 and their children Ben and Becky were also employed by the company;&lt;ref name="TaxBreak-18Jun09"/&gt; Ben was paid more than $100,000 that year.&lt;ref name="Promises-26May09"/&gt;

Cerullo and his wife Barbara are building a {{convert|12000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} home, valued between 2 and 4 million dollars, near [[Salem, South Carolina]].

[[File:Scuola di atene 23.jpg|thumb|[[Bramante]] as [[Euclid]] or [[Archimedes]].]]
'''''The School of Athens''''' ({{lang-it|Scuola di Atene}}) is a [[fresco]] by the [[Italian Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]]. It was painted between 1509 and 1511 as a part of Raphael's commission to decorate the rooms now known as the {{lang|it|[[Raphael Rooms|Stanze di Raffaello]]}}, in the [[Apostolic Palace]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. The {{lang|it|[[Stanza della Segnatura]]}} was the first of the rooms to be decorated, and ''The School of Athens'', representing Philosophy, was probably the third painting to be finished there, after {{lang|it|[[Disputation of the Holy Sacrament|La Disputa]]}} (Theology) on the opposite wall, and the ''[[The Parnassus|Parnassus]]'' (Literature).&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny, p. 74: "The execution of the ''School of Athens'' ... probably followed that of the ''Parnassus''."&lt;/ref&gt; The picture has long been seen as "Raphael's [[masterpiece]] and the perfect embodiment of the classical spirit of the Renaissance".&lt;ref name="JJ"/&gt;

==Program, subject, figure identifications and interpretations==
[[File:Raffael_071.jpg|thumb|[[Zoroaster]], [[Ptolemy]], Raphael as [[Apelles]] and [[Perugino]] or [[Timoteo Viti]] as [[Protogenes]]]]
''The School of Athens'' is one of a group of four main frescoes on the walls of the Stanza (those on either side centrally interrupted by windows) that depict distinct branches of knowledge. Each theme is identified above by a separate [[tondo (art)|tondo]] containing a majestic female figure seated in the clouds, with putti bearing the phrases: "Seek Knowledge of Causes,"  "Divine Inspiration,"  "Knowledge of Things Divine" (''Disputa''), "To Each What Is Due."  Accordingly, the figures on the walls below exemplify Philosophy, Poetry (including Music), Theology, and Law.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Giorgio Vasari]], "Raphael of Urbino", in ''Lives of the Artists'', vol. I: "In each of the four circles he made an allegorical figure to point the significance of the scene beneath, towards which it turns. For the first, where he had painted Philosophy, Astrology, Geometry and Poetry agreeing with Theology, is a woman representing Knowledge, seated in a chair supported on either side by a goddess Cybele, with the numerous breasts ascribed by the ancients to Diana Polymastes. Her garment is of four colours, representing the four elements, her head being the colour of fire, her bust that of air, her thighs that of earth, and her legs that of water." For further clarification, and introduction to more subtle interpretations, see E. H. Gombrich, "Raphael’s ''Stanza della Segnatura'' and the Nature of Its Symbolism", in ''Symbolic Images: Studies in the Art of the Renaissance'' (London: Phaidon, 1975).&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional title is not Raphael's. The subject of the "School" is actually "Philosophy," or at least ancient Greek philosophy, and its overhead tondo-label, "Causarum Cognitio", tells us what kind, as it appears to echo [[Aristotle]]'s emphasis on wisdom as knowing why, hence knowing the causes, in ''Metaphysics'' Book I and ''Physics'' Book II. Indeed, [[Plato]] and Aristotle appear to be the central figures in the scene. However, all the philosophers depicted sought knowledge of first causes. Many lived before Plato and Aristotle, and hardly a third were Athenians. The architecture contains Roman elements, but the general semi-circular setting having Plato and Aristotle at its centre might be alluding to Pythagoras' ''[[Monad (philosophy)|circumpunct]]''.

Commentators have suggested that nearly every great ancient Greek philosopher can be found in the painting, but determining which are depicted is difficult, since Raphael made no designations outside possible likenesses, and no contemporary documents explain the painting. Compounding the problem, Raphael had to invent a system of iconography to allude to various figures for whom there were no traditional visual types. For example, while the [[Socrates]] figure is immediately recognizable from Classical busts, the alleged [[Epicurus]] is far removed from his standard type. Aside from the identities of the figures depicted, many aspects of the fresco have been variously interpreted, but few such interpretations are unanimously accepted among scholars.

The popular idea that the rhetorical gestures of Plato and Aristotle are kinds of pointing (to the heavens, and down to earth) is very likely. But Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' – which is the book Raphael places in his hand – was a sophisticated treatment of space, time, and change, including the Earth, which guided mathematical sciences for over a millennium. Aristotle, with his four-elements theory, held that all change on Earth was owing to motions of the heavens. In the painting Aristotle carries his ''[[Ethics (Aristotle)|Ethics]]'', which he denied could be reduced to a mathematical science. It is not certain how much the young Raphael knew of ancient philosophy, what guidance he might have had from people such as [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], or whether a detailed program was dictated by his sponsor, [[Pope Julius II]].

Nevertheless, the fresco has even recently been  interpreted as an exhortation to philosophy and, in a deeper way, as a visual representation of the role of Love in elevating people toward upper knowledge, largely in consonance with contemporary theories of Marsilio Ficino and other neo-Platonic thinkers linked to Raphael.&lt;ref&gt;M. Smolizza, ‘’Rafael y el Amor. La Escuela de Atenas como protréptico a la filosofia’’, in ‘Idea y Sentimiento. Itinerarios por el dibujo de Rafael a Cézanne’, Barcelona, 2007, pp. 29–77. [A review of the main interpretations proposed in the last two centuries.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, according to Vasari, the scene includes Raphael himself, the [[Duke of Mantua]], [[Zoroaster]] and some [[Evangelism|Evangelists]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Vasari, "Raphael received a hearty welcome from Pope Julius, and in the chamber of the Segnatura he painted the theologians reconciling Philosophy and Astrology with Theology, including portraits of all the wise men of the world in dispute."&lt;/ref&gt;

However, to [[Heinrich Wölfflin]], "it is quite wrong to attempt interpretations of the ''School of Athens'' as an esoteric treatise ... The all-important thing was the artistic motive which expressed a physical or spiritual state, and the name of the person was a matter of indifference" in Raphael's time.&lt;ref&gt;Wōlfflin, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael's artistry then orchestrates a beautiful space, continuous with that of viewers in the Stanza, in which a great variety of human figures, each one expressing "mental states by physical actions," interact, in a "polyphony" unlike anything in earlier art, in the ongoing dialogue of Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Wōlfflin, pp. 94ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

An interpretation of the fresco relating to hidden symmetries of the figures and the star constructed by Bramante was given by Guerino Mazzola and collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783540172673|authors=Guerino Mazzola et al.|title=Rasterbild - Bildraster|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1986|ISBN=3-540-17267-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main basis are two mirrored triangles on the drawing from Bramante (Euclid), which correspond to the feet positions of certain figures.&lt;ref&gt;This can be seen [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-3-642-71700-0%2F1.pdf here].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Figures===
The identities of some of the philosophers in the picture, such as Plato and Aristotle, are certain. Beyond that, identifications of Raphael's figures have always been hypothetical. To complicate matters, beginning from Vasari's efforts, some have received multiple identifications, not only as ancients but also as figures contemporary with Raphael. [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] mentions portraits of the young [[Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]], leaning over Bramante with his hands raised near the bottom right, and Raphael himself.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Vasari, ''Lives of the Artists'', v. I, sel. &amp; transl. by George Bull (London: Penguin, 1965), p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was writing over 40 years after the painting, and never knew Raphael, but no doubt reflects what was believed in his time.  Many other popular identifications of portraits are very dubious.

{{ill|Luitpold Dussler|de}} counts among those who can be identified with some certainty: Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Pythagoras,&lt;ref name=Raffael&gt;Jürg Meyer zur Capellen, however, qualifies the certainty of this identification writing "eine Gruppe von Lesenden und Disputierenden, die um eine Sitzfigur, vielleicht Pythagoras, angeordnet ist." ("a group of people reading and debating, arranged around a seated figure, perhaps Pythagoras."). Jürg Meyer zur Capellen: ''Raffael'' (Munich: Beck 2010), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid,&lt;ref&gt;Again, Meyer zur Capellen is more cautious: "Eine Gruppe von Schülern umgibt einen Lehrer (Archimedes oder Euklid?), der auf einer Tafel ein geometrisches Prinzip erläutert" Jürg Meyer zur Capellen: ''Raffael'' (Munich: Beck 2010), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy, Zoroaster, Raphael, Sodoma and Diogenes of Sinope. Other identifications he holds to be "more or less speculative".&lt;ref&gt;Luitpold Dussler: ''Raphael. A Critical Catalogue'' (London and New York: Phaidon 1971), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central figures (14 and 15)===
[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|180 px|left||An elder [[Plato]] walks alongside [[Aristotle]].]]
In the center of the fresco, at its architecture's central [[vanishing point]], are the two undisputed main subjects: [[Plato]] on the left and [[Aristotle]], his student, on the right. Both figures hold modern (of the time), bound copies of their books in their left hands, while gesturing with their right. Plato holds ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'',  Aristotle his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Plato is depicted as old, grey, wise-looking, and bare-foot.  By contrast Aristotle, slightly ahead of him, is in mature manhood, handsome, well-shod and dressed with gold, and the youth about them seem to look his way.  In addition, these two central figures gesture along different dimensions: Plato vertically, upward along the picture-plane, into the beautiful vault above; Aristotle on the horizontal plane at right-angles to the picture-plane (hence in strong [[foreshortening]]), initiating a powerful flow of space toward viewers.

It is popularly thought that their gestures indicate central aspects of their philosophies, for [[Plato]], his [[Theory of Forms]], and for Aristotle, his [[Empiricism|empiricist]] views, with an emphasis on concrete [[particular]]s. Many interpret the painting to show a divergence of the two philosophical schools. Plato argues a sense of timelessness whilst Aristotle looks into the physicality of life and the present realm.

===Setting===
[[File:Raffael_060.jpg|thumb|Detail of the architecture]]
The building is in the shape of a [[St. Clement's Cross|Greek cross]], which some have suggested was intended to show a harmony between [[paganism|pagan]] [[philosophy]] and [[Christian theology]]&lt;ref name="JJ"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MMYHuvhWBH4C''History of Art: The Western Tradition''] by Horst Woldemar Janson, Anthony F. Janson (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Christianity and Paganism]] and [[Christian philosophy]]). The architecture of the building was inspired by the work of [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who, according to [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]], helped Raphael with the architecture in the picture.&lt;ref name="JJ"/&gt; (The resulting architecture was similar to the then new [[St. Peter's Basilica]].)&lt;ref name="JJ"/&gt;

There are two sculptures in the background. The one on the left is the god [[Apollo]], god of light, archery and music, holding a [[lyre]].&lt;ref name="JJ"/&gt; The sculpture on the right is [[Athena]], goddess of [[wisdom]], in her Roman guise as [[Minerva]].&lt;ref name="JJ"/&gt;

The main arch, above the characters, shows a [[Meander (art)|meander]] (also known as a Greek fret or Greek key design), a design using continuous lines that repeat in a "series of rectangular bends" which originated on pottery of the Greek Geometric period and then become widely used in ancient Greek architectural friezes.&lt;ref&gt;Lyttleton, Margaret.

==Copies==
The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] has a rectangular version over 4 metres by 8 metres in size, painted on canvas, dated 1755 by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]] on display in the eastern Cast Court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O89799/the-school-of-athens-after-oil-painting-mengs-anton-raphael/ V&amp;A Museum: Copy of Raphael's School of Athens in the Vatican]. collections.vam.ac.uk (2009-08-25). Retrieved on 2016-03-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern reproductions of the fresco abound.  For example, a full-size one can be seen in the auditorium of Old Cabell Hall at the [[University of Virginia]]. Produced in 1902 by George W. Breck to replace an older reproduction that was destroyed in a fire in 1895, it is four inches off scale from the original, because the Vatican would not allow identical reproductions of its art works.&lt;ref&gt;Information on [http://www.virginia.edu/music/cabell.html Old Cabell Hall] from University of Virginia&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reproductions include: by Neide, in  [[Königsberg Cathedral]],  [[Kaliningrad]],&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vHg2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA247&amp;lpg=RA1-PA247&amp;dq=school+of+athens+konigsberg+cathedral&amp;source=web&amp;ots=h21ALhbKl0&amp;sig=WWy7S6bughX2DOr-p44AkR79s1g Northern Germany: As Far as the Bavarian and Austrian Frontiers]'', Baedeker, 1890, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]]'s Highsmith University Student Union, and a recent one in the seminar room at [[Baylor University]]'s Brooks College. A copy of Raphael's School of Athens was painted on the wall of the ceremonial stairwell that leads to the famous, main-floor reading room of the [[Sainte-Geneviève Library|Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève]] in Paris.

The two figures at the left of Plotinus were used as part of the cover art of both ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II|II]]'' albums of [[Guns N' Roses]].

==Theme==
[[File:MANNapoli 124545 plato's academy mosaic.jpg|thumb|[[Plato's Academy mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]]]]
A similar theme is known as [[Plato's Academy mosaic]], and perhaps emerged in form of statues at the [[Serapeum of Alexandria]] and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] [[Saqqara]]. Mimaut mentioned in the 19th century nine statues at Serapeum of Alexandria holding rolls. Eleven statues were found at [[Saqqara]]. A review of "Les Statues Ptolémaïques du Sarapieion de Memphis" noted they were probably sculpted in the 3rd century with limestone and stucco, some standing others sitting. [[Alan Rowe (archaeologist)|Rowe]] and Rees 1956 suggested that both scenes in the Serapeum of Alexandria and Saqqara share a similar theme, such as with Plato's Academy mosaic, with Saqqara figures attributed to: "(1) Pindare, (2) Démétrios de Phalère, (3) x (?), (4) Orphée (?) aux oiseaux, (5) Hésiode, (6) Homère, (7) x (?), (8) Protagoras, (9) Thalès, (10) Héraclite, (11) Platon, (12) Aristote (?)."&lt;ref name="RoweRees1956"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:1m1914&amp;datastreamId=POST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF|authors=Alan Rowe and B.

'''''The Slave Market''''' is a painting of about 1882 by the 19th century French artist [[Gustave Boulanger]], who specialized in classical and [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] genre scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Masler, 39&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts an [[Ancient Roman]] slave auction. It shows the marketing of seven young people, ranging in age from children to young adults, as slaves. Both male slaves, as well as three of the female slaves, bear a similarity in appearance perhaps suggesting that they are members of a family forced into slavery by economic conditions. All are wearing tags to indicate their availability as slaves. The youngest boy is completely naked, while the young man next to him is wearing a loincloth. The young woman sitting next to them is topless, wearing only a skirt, but she is covering her breasts with her legs. The standing African woman is also topless, wearing a white loincloth, and she is covering her breasts with her hands. The taller, standing, young woman is wearing a translucent garment which clearly shows her breasts and [[pubic hair]]—she is trying to shield her eyes, perhaps because her potential buyers include former friends and neighbors, who are probably seeing her nude for the first time. The adolescent girl next to her is also topless and barefoot, wearing a skirt. The young woman sitting next to them is wearing a loose garment which leaves both her breasts and her genitals exposed. The auctioneer eats his lunch with a very casual attitude.

From a common type of [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] [[academic art]] of the period, it depicts an eroticized scene clad as a [[history painting]], as was customary at the time in [[Paris]]. Boulanger had visited Italy, Greece, and North Africa, and the painting reflects his attention to culturally correct details and skill in rendering the female form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Masler |first=Marilyn  |authorlink= |editor-last=Masler |editor-first=Marilyn  |editor2-last=Pacini |editor2-first=Marina |contribution=Embracing the Academic Tradition |title =Carl Gutherz: Poetic Vision and Academic Ideals  |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=2009 |location=Jackson, Tennessee |pages =38–39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCz8zO0_ItgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-915525-11-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vampire hunter''' or '''vampire slayer''' is a character in folklore and fiction who specializes in finding and destroying [[vampire]]s, and sometimes other supernatural creatures. A vampire hunter is usually described as having extensive knowledge of vampires and other monstrous creatures, including their powers and weaknesses, and uses this knowledge to effectively combat them. In most literature, vampire hunters are simply humans with more than average knowledge about the occult, while they may also be supernatural beings, having superhuman abilities in works of fiction. A well known and influential vampire hunter is Professor [[Abraham Van Helsing]], a character in [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 horror novel, ''[[Dracula]]''.

==In folklore==
"Professional" or semi-professional vampire hunters played some part in the vampire beliefs of the [[Balkans]] (especially in [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarian]], [[Serb]]ian, and [[Romani people|Romani]] folk beliefs). In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], the terms used to designate them included ''glog'' (lit. "[[Common Hawthorn|hawthorn]]", the species of wood used for the stake), ''vampirdzhiya'', ''vampirar'', ''dzhadazhiya'', ''svetocher''.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

They were usually either born on [[Saturday]] (then called [[Week-day names#Weekdays numbered from Monday|Sabbatarian]]s,&lt;ref name=summers&gt;{{cite book | last = Abbott | first = George F. | date =1903 | title = Macedonian Folklore | pages = 221–222}}.

It was also believed that someone born on a Saturday could see a vampire when it was otherwise invisible&lt;ref name=summers/&gt;&lt;ref name=dimitr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McClelland, Bruce A.|title = Slayers and Their Vampires: A Cultural History of Killing the Dead|publisher=[[University of Michigan]]|year=2006|pages=62–79|isbn=978-0-472-06923-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and sometimes other supernatural entities as well); similarly for the ''dhampir''. In the case of the Sabbatarians, it was believed in some places that they needed to be fed meat from a sheep killed by a wolf (Bulgarian ''vâlkoedene''); this would enable them not to fear the things that only they were able to see. In [[Croatia]]n and [[Slovenia]]n legends, the villages had their own vampire hunters that were called [[Krsnik (vampire hunter)|kresniks]], whose spirits were able to turn into animals at night to fight off the vampire or ''kudlak''.
  
Some carried a kit that used mallet, stake, crucifix.  If part of a church it included holy water, holy oil, etc.  However the most important things it carried were items such as rope, crowbars, or even pistols.&lt;ref name="dimitr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Маринов, Димитър. 1994 (first edition 1914) Народна вяра и религиозни обичаи.

==In fiction==
The vampire hunter has found new popularity in modern fiction and popular culture.

The most widely known example of a vampire hunter is [[Abraham Van Helsing]] of the novel ''[[Dracula]]'' and in other works of fiction adapting or modifying that work. Other more recent figures include [[Buffy Summers|Buffy "the Vampire Slayer" Summers]] from the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|television show]] and [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|film]] of the same name. Buffy's spin-off series [[Angel (1999 TV series)|''Angel'']] is also focused on a vampire hunter, the titular star, Angel "the World's Champion," a vampire himself, is often portrayed battling vampires. Vampire hunters have also appeared in video games, such as ''[[Castlevania]]'' (occupation of the famed Belmont lineage), and ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'' (with factions such as the Dawnguard).

As well as being knowledgeable about vampire lore, vampire hunters in fiction are often armed with an eclectic mix of items and weapons which are designed to take maximum advantage of the monster's traditional weaknesses. These have included [[firearm]]s with [[silver]] [[ammunition]], appropriate religious symbols, [[crossbow]]s that fire all wood bolts and even [[watergun]]s filled with blessed [[holy water]] in the movies ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' and ''[[From Dusk Till Dawn]]''.

The organizational strength of depicted vampire hunters can vary wildly. Most hunter characters are in small groups working alone and in secret. By contrast, the [[Hellsing Organization]] in the [[anime]] [[television series]], ''[[Hellsing]]'' is a British government paramilitary strike force with access to troops, heavy combat vehicles and weapons and even allied vampires.

While predominantly depicted as human, examples of other types of vampire hunters also exist. [[Dhampir]]ic figures, having a mix of human and vampire blood, are a popular form. [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]] from the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gee|first=James Paul|year=2007|title=Pleasure, learning, video games, and life: The projective stance|journal=A new literacies sampler|volume=29|issn=1523-9543|citeseerx = 10.1.1.128.3508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[eponym]]ous hero of the ''[[Blade (comics)|Blade]]'' series of comic books, [[Blade (film series)|movies]], [[Blade: The Series|television series]], and [[Blade Anime|anime]], are both examples of dhampir vampire-hunters. Even rarer are vampire hunters that are vampires themselves. Two examples of this type can be found in [[Morbius, the Living Vampire#Ultimate Marvel|Morbius from ''Ultimate Spider-Man'']], and Zero Kiryuu in the manga and anime series ''[[Vampire Knight]]''.

The image of the vampire hunter is often a mysterious and [[drama]]tic avenging hero, an [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] [[extremist]], a [[mad scientist]], or sometimes a mix of these. A hunter may be a heroic figure, a villain (from the perspective of the vampire), a lonesome avenger, or sometimes, although not usually, a [[bounty hunter]]-style character, hunting vampires for profit. Vampire hunters have also popularly been depicted as hunting various creatures such as [[werewolves]], [[demons]], and other forms of [[undead]] as well. Others have been depicted as [[Mage (fantasy)|mages]] and [[cyborgs]]. Vampire hunters are often associated with and/or members of the clergy, holy orders, or other religious organizations which may be dedicated to fighting vampires, demons, and other supernatural forces. Vampire hunting as a family tradition or birthright is a popular use of the archetype in fiction, such as the [[List of Castlevania characters|Belmont family]] from the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series. Some hunters devote their entire lives to the eradication of vampires, for others it is just a strange hobby.

Of course with the job for human hunter, comes the risk of getting bitten and turned into vampires themselves. More often than not fellow hunters, usually do mercy killing to prevent them from becoming monsters, though in some fiction it may be possible for a hunter to purify and/or cure themselves (and/or others) of vampirism, especially if the person in question was recently turned into a vampire. Another common trope is hunters being forced to slay their loved ones and/or allies who have been turned into vampires. Alternatively, after becoming a vampire, sometimes hunters will continue to fight and hunt vampires using their newly acquired vampire powers/abilities (sometimes being hunted by their former allies and other human vampire hunters). In addition to human hunters, dhampirs, and vampires that hunt other vampires, it is not uncommon for vampire hunters to be other supernatural creatures such as werewolves or witches. Additionally, some human hunters may possess divine/holy powers, superhuman, and/or other supernatural abilities that they can use both to fight and protect themselves from vampires and other supernatural entities they hunt. Some hunters may even resort to using dark powers/weapons (usually dark magic and/or demonic in nature). Some human hunters may even be tempted to become vampires themselves in order to obtain their powers and immortality, either to continue hunting them, due to fear of their own mortality, and/or simply a lust for power.

The '''Victorian Artists Society''', which can trace its establishment to 1856 in [[Melbourne]], promotes artistic education, art classes and gallery hire [[art gallery|exhibition]] in Australia.

The Victorian Artists Society was formed in March 1888 following the decision of the Victorian Academy of Arts and the Australian Artists' Association to amalgamate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article6109757 |title=VICTORIAN ACADEMY OF ARTS. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=14 March 1888 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Victorian Academy of Arts had been formed in 1870 with 'about twenty artists and amateurs' amongst its first members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13199253 |title=OUR MELBOURNE LETTER. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=22 January 1870 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy's forerunner, the Victorian Society of Fine Arts, was established in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71468655 |title=HISTORIC MELBOURNE. |newspaper=[[Australian Town and Country Journal]] |location=NSW |date=22 June 1901 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=30 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Artists' Association held its first exhibition in 1886 with works by [[Tom Roberts]], [[Louis Buvelot]], [[Frederick McCubbin]], and [[Arthur Streeton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11571934 |title=EXHIBITION OF THE AUSTRALIAN ARTISTS' ASSOCIATION. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=7 September 1886 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding president of the new amalgamated Society was Joseph Anderson Panton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article89950234 |title=DEATH OF MR. J. A. PANTON. |newspaper=[[Bendigo Advertiser]] |location=Vic. |date=27 October 1913 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later presidents included [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Paul Raphael Montford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article4396813 |title=IN A SCULPTOR'S STUDIO. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=5 May 1931 |accessdate=20 September 2013 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The premises at 430 Albert Street in East Melbourne were erected for the society in 1888, enlarged in 1892 and modernised in 1953. Facilities include four galleries, teaching studio, members room, offices and other ancillary facilities.

Membership is restricted to 1000, a figure last reached in 1979, and is open for new members to join. Membership is open to all persons interested in the fine arts, with the emphasis on practising artists.

Regular classes are held in various media which are open to members and non-members including watercolour, oil painting, drawing, mixed media, life model.

Exhibitions are held annually, including the seasonal spring, summer, autumn and winter exhibitions, with awards given at each.

The 2017 Artist of the Year Award was given to Ray Hewitt.
