&lt;/ref&gt;
on the basis of the [[Ancient greek#Modern use of Ancient Greek|Neoclassical Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἄγνωσις}}, ''agnōsis'', "not knowing" (cf. [[Attic Greek]] ἄγνωτος "unknown"&lt;ref&gt;See: [[wikt:ἄγνωτος|Wiktionary entry on ἄγνωτος]].&lt;/ref&gt;), and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''.&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/2005/pr-agno-100505.html |title= Conference to explore the social construction of ignorance |accessdate= 2007-08-12|date= 2005-10-04|first= Barbara |last= Palmer|publisher= Stanford News Service |quote= Proctor uses the term "agnotology" – a word coined from agnosis, meaning "not knowing" – to describe a new approach to looking at knowledge through the study of ignorance.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070724074303/http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/2005/pr-agno-100505.html| archivedate= 24 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, the term also highlights the increasingly common condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before.  [[David Dunning]] of Cornell University is another academic who studies the spread of ignorance.  "Dunning warns that the internet is helping propagate ignorance – it is a place where everyone has a chance to be their own expert, he says, which makes them prey for powerful interests wishing to deliberately spread ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160105-the-man-who-studies-the-spread-of-ignorance |title= The Man Who Studies the Spread of Ignorance|last=Kenyon|first= Georgina|date= |website= |publisher= BBC|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1999 book ''The Erotic Margin'', Irvin C. Schick referred to ''unknowledge'' "to distinguish it from ignorance, and to denote socially constructed lack of knowledge, that is, a conscious absence of socially pertinent knowledge". As an example, he offered the labeling "terra incognita" in early maps, noting that "The reconstruction of parts of the globe as uncharted territory is ... the ''production of unknowledge'', the transformation of those parts into potential objects of Western political and economic attention. It is the enabling of colonialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schick |first=Irvin C. |title=The Erotic Margin: Sexuality and Spatiality in Alteritist Discourse |publisher=Verso |location=New York and London |year=1999 |pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many causes of culturally induced [[ignorance]]. These include the influence of the [[media (communication)|media]], either through neglect or as a result of deliberate misrepresentation and manipulation. [[Corporation]]s and governmental agencies can contribute to the subject matter studied by agnotology through [[secrecy]] and [[Censorship|suppression]] of information, document destruction, and myriad forms of inherent or avoidable culturopolitical selectivity, inattention, and forgetfulness.&lt;ref name=2005conf/&gt;

Proctor cites as a prime example of the deliberate production of ignorance the [[tobacco industry]]'s [[Tobacco advertising|advertising]] campaign to [[Merchants of Doubt|manufacture doubt]] about the [[cancer]]ous and other [[Health effects of tobacco|health effects]] of [[tobacco use]]. Under the banner of science, the industry produced research about everything except tobacco hazards to exploit public uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

At Stanford, we study how ignorance is manufactured. It is an art we call agnotology.)
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnotology also focuses on how and why diverse forms of knowledge do ''not'' "come to be", or are ignored or delayed. For example, knowledge about [[plate tectonics]] was [[censorship|censored]] and delayed for at least a decade because some evidence remained [[classified information|classified military information]] related to [[Submarine warfare|undersea warfare]].&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
The term "agnotology" was first coined in a footnote in Proctor's 1995 book, ''The Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know About Cancer'': "Historians and philosophers of science have tended to treat ignorance as an ever-expanding vacuum into which knowledge is sucked – or even, as [[Johannes Kepler]] once put it, as the mother who must die for [[science]] to be born. Ignorance, though, is more complex than this. It has a distinct and changing political geography that is often an excellent indicator of the politics of knowledge. We need a political agnotology to complement our political epistemologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proctor |first=Robert |title=The Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know About Cancer |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1995 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proctor was quoted using the term to describe his research "only half jokingly", as "agnotology" in a 2001 interview about his [[lapidary]] work with the colorful rock [[agate]]. He connected the two seemingly unrelated topics by noting the lack of [[geology|geologic]] knowledge and study of agate since its first known description by [[Theophrastus]] in 300 BC, relative to the extensive research on other rocks and minerals such as [[diamond]]s, [[asbestos]], [[granite]], and [[coal]], all of which have much higher commercial value. He said agate was a "victim of scientific disinterest", the same "structured apathy" he called "the social construction of ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rps.psu.edu/0109/agateer.html |title=The Agateer |accessdate=2007-08-12 |work=Research Penn State|first=Nancy Marie |last=Brown|date=September 2001| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070811131237/http://www.rps.psu.edu/0109/agateer.html| archivedate= 11 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was later quoted as calling it "agnotology, the study of ignorance", in a 2003 ''[[The New York Times]]'' story on medical historians testifying as [[expert witness]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/14/arts/14HIST.html?ex=1371009600&amp;en=e10e0387e68ab30f&amp;ei=5007 |title=History for Hire in Industry Lawsuits|date=2003-06-14 |accessdate=2014-07-15 |author =Cohen, Patricia |work=[[The New York Times]]|quote=Mr. Proctor, who describes his specialty as "agnotology, the study of ignorance", argues that the tobacco industry has tried to give the impression that the hazards of cigarette smoking are still an open question even when the scientific evidence is indisputable. "The tobacco industry is famous for having seen itself as a manufacturer of two different products," he said, "tobacco and doubt".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proctor co-organized a pair of events with [[Londa Schiebinger]], his wife, who is also a science history professor: the first was a workshop at the [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 2003 titled "Agnatology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bshs.org.uk/agnatology-the-cultural-production-of-ignorance |website=The British Society for the History of Science |title=Agnatology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance |accessdate=2014-07-15 |quote=Science, Medicine, and Technology in Culture Pennsylvania University Presents a Workshop: ... Robert N. Proctor and Londa Schiebinger, co-organizers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later a conference at [[Stanford University]] in 2005 titled "Agnotology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance".&lt;ref name=2005conf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPST/AgnotologyConference.html |title= Agnotology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance|accessdate=2007-08-12 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political economy===

In 2004, [[Londa Schiebinger]]&lt;ref name="news-service.stanford.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/october13/londa-1013.html |title=IRWG director hopes to create 'go to' center for gender studies |accessdate=2007-08-12 |date=2004-10-13 |work=Stanford News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;
gave a more precise definition of agnotology in a paper on 18th-century voyages of scientific discovery and gender relations, and contrasted it with [[epistemology]], the theory of knowledge, saying that the latter questions how we know while the former questions why we do not know: "Ignorance is often not merely the absence of knowledge but an outcome of cultural and political struggle".&lt;ref name=Schiebinger2004&gt;{{cite journal

 | quote =  I develop a methodological tool that historian of science Robert Proctor has called “agnotology”—the study of {{sic|hide=y|culturally|-}}induced ignorances—that serves as a counterweight to more traditional concerns for epistemology, refocusing questions about "how we know" to include questions about what we do not know, and why not. Ignorance is often not merely the absence of knowledge but an outcome of the cultural and political struggle.

Its use as a critical description of the political economy has been expanded upon by [[Michael Betancourt]] in a 2010 article titled "Immaterial Value and Scarcity in Digital Capitalism"&lt;ref name="Betancourt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=652 |title=CTheory |accessdate=2010-09-06 |quote="Immaterial Value and Scarcity in Digital Capitalism", CTheory, Theory Beyond the Codes: tbc002, Date Published: 6/10/2010, Arthur and Marilouise Kroker, Editors| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101005143051/http://ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=652| archivedate= 5 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded in the book ''The Critique of Digital Capitalism''.&lt;ref name="Betancourt2"&gt;{{cite book | last=Betancourt |first=Michael | authorlink = Michael Betancourt | title = [[The Critique of Digital Capitalism]]: An Analysis of the Political Economy of Digital Culture and Technology | publisher = [[Punctum Books]] | location = Brooklyn | year = 2016 | ISBN = 978-0692598443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis is focused on the housing bubble as well as the bubble economy of the period from 1980 to 2008. Betancourt argues that this political economy should be termed "agnotologic capitalism" because the systemic production and maintenance of ignorance is a major feature that enables the economy to function as it allows the creation of a "bubble economy".&lt;ref name="news-service.stanford.edu"/&gt;

Betancourt's argument is posed in relation to the idea of [[affective labor]]. He states that &lt;blockquote&gt;The creation of systemic unknowns where any potential "fact" is always already countered by an alternative of apparently equal weight and value renders engagement with the conditions of reality – the very situations affective labor seeks to assuage – contentious and a source of confusion, reflected by the inability of participants in bubbles to be aware of the imminent collapse until after it has happened. The biopolitical paradigm of distraction, what [Juan Martin] Prada calls "life to enjoy", can only be maintained if the underlying strictures remain hidden from view. If affective labor works to reduce alienation, agnotology works to eliminate the potential for dissent.&lt;ref name="Betancourt"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his view, the role of affective labor is to enable the continuation of the agnotologic effects that enable the maintenance of the capitalist status quo.

==Agnoiology==

A similar word from the same Greek roots, ''agnoiology'', meaning "the science or study of ignorance, which determines its quality and conditions"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Agnoiology|volume=1|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the doctrine concerning those things of which we are necessarily ignorant"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |editor= Porter, Noah | publisher= G &amp; C. Merriam Co.| year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes a branch of philosophy studied by [[James Frederick Ferrier]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9002832/James-Frederick-Ferrier |title=James Frederick Ferrier |accessdate=2007-08-12 |format= |work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ainigmology ==
Anthropologist Glenn Stone points out that most of the examples of agnotology (such as work promoting tobacco use) do not actually create a lack of knowledge so much as they create confusion.  A more accurate term for such writing would be "ainigmology", from the root ''ainigma'' (as in "enigma"); in Greek this refers to riddles or to language that obscures the true meaning of a story.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Glenn Davis 2014 Biosecurity in the Age of Genetic Engineering. In '''[http://pages.wustl.edu/files/pages/imce/stone/stone_2014_bioinsecurity.pdf Bioinsecurity and Human Vulnerability]''', ed Nancy Chen and Lesley Sharp, pp. 71-86.  Santa Fe: SAR Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media influence ==

The availability of such large amounts of knowledge in this information age may not necessarily be producing a knowledgeable citizenry. Instead it may be allowing many people to cherry-pick information in blogs or news that reinforces their existing beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| title=Study: Americans choose media messages that agree with their views

| pages=426–448}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and to be distracted from new knowledge by repetitive or base entertainments. There is conflicting evidence on how television viewing affects intelligence as well as values formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

An emerging new scientific discipline that has connections to agnotology is [[cognitronics]]:
;cognitronics : aims (a) at explicating the distortions in the perception of the world caused by the information society and globalization and (b) at coping with these distortions in different fields. Cognitronics is studying and looking for the ways of improving cognitive mechanisms of processing information and developing emotional sphere of the personality - the ways aiming at compensating three mentioned shifts in the systems of values and, as an indirect consequence, for the ways of developing symbolic information processing skills of the learners, linguistic mechanisms, associative and reasoning abilities, broad mental outlook being important preconditions of successful work practically in every sphere of professional activity in information society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3675">An '''animal nutritionist''' is a person who specializes in [[animal nutrition]], which is especially concerned with the dietary needs of [[animals in captivity]]: [[livestock]], [[pets]], and animals in [[wildlife rehabilitation]] facilities.

The science of animal nutrition encompasses principles of [[chemistry]] (especially [[biochemistry]]), [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[ethology]] (animal behavior). An animal nutrition in the [[food industry]] may also be concerned with [[economics]] and [[food processing]].

==Education==
A [[Bachelor of Science]] in agricultural, biological or related life sciences is usually required. A typical course would study [[metabolism]] of [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[minerals]], [[vitamin]]s and water, and the relationship of these nutrients and animal production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animalscience.calpoly.edu/areas_of_study/nutrition/courses.asp Cal Poly - Areas of Study] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103022826/http://animalscience.calpoly.edu/areas_of_study/nutrition/courses.asp |date=November 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Master’s degree]] in nutrition is often seen in animal nutrition and the field  often requires a [[Ph.D.]] in the science of nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.auburn.edu/ansc/Students&amp;Adv/graduate_programs.html Auburn University Animal Sciences]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016175854/http://www.ag.auburn.edu/ansc/Students%26Adv/graduate_programs.html |date=October 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career activities ==
Those with an educational background can expect to be employed in the following areas:
*Evaluating the chemical and [[nutritional value]] of various [[animal feeds]], feed supplements, [[grass]] and [[forage]] for livestock, recreational animals such as [[horse]]s and [[pony|ponies]], [[pet food]]s for companion animals, [[fish]], and [[bird]]s
*Nutritional disorders and the preservation of feeds
*Diet formulation and ration size
*Diets for performance and health
*Diets for reproduction of animals
*Economics of feeding systems
*Dietary regimens
*Animal studies and laboratory trials
*Marketing strategies for new food formulas
*Quality control and performance of feeds
*Investigating nutritional disorders and diet related diseases&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Explore_types_of_jobs/Types_of_Job/p!eipaL?state=showocc&amp;pageno=1&amp;idno=17 Exploring job types: Animal nutritionist]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pereskia grandifolia ies.jpg|thumb|Aeroles and spines of the tree-like ''[[Pereskia grandifolia]]'']]
In [[botany]], '''areoles''' are small light- to dark-colored bumps on [[cactus|cacti]] out of which grow clusters of  [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spine]]s. Areoles are important diagnostic features of [[cactus|cacti]], and identify them as a family distinct from other [[succulent plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Edward F., The Cactus Family, Pub: Timber Press 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-88192-498-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Gordon Rowley - What is an Areole ? [https://web.archive.org/web/20080820042520/http://www.bcss.org.uk/areole.pdf http://www.bcss.org.uk/areole.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;The spines are not easily detachable, but on certain cacti, members of the subfamily [[Opuntioideae]], smaller, detachable bristles, [[glochid]]s, also grow out of the areoles and afford additional protection.

Areoles represent highly specialized branches on cacti. Apparently, they evolved as abortive branch buds while their spines evolved as vestigial leaves{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}. In branched cacti, such as Opuntioidiae and the [[saguaro]], new branches grow from areoles, because that is where the buds are. The development of the areole seems to have been an important element in the adaptation of cacti to niches in desert ecology.

Some of the Opuntioideae have spines, as well as glochids, on their areoles; some have only glochids. Structurally, the glochids seem to be bristles rather than evolved leaves{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}. They are detachable and resemble small, sharp splinters. Unlike the spines, glochids generally are barbed and are very difficult to remove from the [[skin]].

==Evolution==
The cactus family, the [[Cactaceae]], evolved 30–40 million years ago in the Americas{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}, originally completely separately from Africa, Europe, and Asia, although, probably within the last few million years, some species of ''[[Rhipsalis]]'' appear to have been carried to parts of Asia and Africa{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}, most likely by birds.

The areole was one of the unique features that cacti developed, possibly in adaptation to the ambient climate in the area in which they emerged. Accordingly, the areoles distinguish the family Cactaceae from other [[succulent]] plants both in the [[New World]] and the [[Old World]].

==Importance==
For the cacti, areoles are an important evolutionary modification.  They give rise to spines and glochids, which are their primary means of self-defense.  In addition, because these spines arise from areoles and not directly from the plant [[Plant stem|stem]], cacti can more effectively cover themselves with spines than other plants. The spines themselves can be of greater size and number.

In addition, areoles can produce spines of many different types to suit their needs.  A typical areole may have one or a few long, sharp central spines, which serve as the primary defense.  Beneath them  are often numerous (10 or more) smaller, radial spines produced around the edge of the areole.  These may serve as a secondary defense against small creatures that can get past the central spines. In some species, though, such as ''[[Cephalocereus senilis]]'', the tangle of hairy radial spines serves to shade the plant and retain a layer of cool, humid air next to it.

Areoles contributed largely to the evolutionary success of the [[Cactaceae]] throughout the [[Range (biology)|range]] of the family, and account for the diversification seen in the many species today.

[[File:Mace of nutmeg - ml-Jathi.jpg|thumb|right|An aril that surrounds the [[nutmeg seed]] is used as a [[spice]] called [[mace (spice)|mace]].]]
[[File:ARS Litchi chinensis.jpg|thumb|right|The edible white aril of ''[[Litchi chinensis]]'' is sometimes called an arillode or false aril. It grows partly from the [[funiculus (biology)|funiculus]] and partly from the [[integument]] of the seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Banerji, I. |author2=Chaudhuri, K.L. |year=1944 |title=A contribution to the life history of ''Litchi chinensis'' Sonn. |journal=Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Section B |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=19–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An '''aril''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|r|ɪ|l}}), also called an '''arillus''', is a specialized outgrowth from a seed that partly or completely covers the seed. An '''arillode''' or '''false aril''' is sometimes distinguished: whereas an aril grows from the attachment point of the seed to the [[ovary]] (from the [[Ovule|funiculus]] or ''[[Hilum (biology)|hilum]]''), an arillode forms from a different point on the seed coat.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Beentje, H. |author2=Williamson, J. |year=2010  |title=The Kew Plant Glossary: an Illustrated Dictionary of Plant Terms |publisher=Kew Publishing |location=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "aril" is sometimes applied to any fleshy appendage of the seed in [[flowering plants]], such as the [[mace (spice)|mace]] of the nutmeg seed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Endress, P.K. |year=1973 |title=Arils And Aril-Like Structures In Woody Ranales |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=1159–1171 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1973.tb02092.x |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1973.tb02092.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arils and arillodes are often edible enticements that encourage animals to transport the seed, thereby assisting in seed dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvEOb0HKyoAC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=aril+edible+dispersal+seed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xnJzYdJhVT&amp;sig=r28-mZ3Cq5LivKdI1LJMQyEreLo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=11uZTvWVL87E8QOw-821BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=aril%20&amp;f=false|title=Fruit and Seed Production|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Pseudarils''' are aril-like structures commonly found on the [[Pyrena|pyrenes]] of [[Burseraceae]] species that develop from the [[mesocarp]] of the ovary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/aobpla/pls027| pmid = 23115709| title = The fruit of Bursera: Structure, maturation and parthenocarpy| journal = [[AoB Plants]]| volume = 2012| pages = pls027| year = 2012| last1 = Ramos-Ordonez | first1 = M.

The aril may create a [[fruit]]-like structure, called (among other names) a ''[[accessory fruit|false fruit]]''. False fruit are found in numerous [[Angiosperm]] taxa. The edible false of the [[longan]], [[lychee]] and [[ackee]] fruits are highly developed arils surrounding the seed rather than a [[pericarp]] layer.  Such arils are also found in a few species of [[gymnosperm]]s, notably the [[Taxus|yews]] and related [[Pinophyta|conifers]] such as the [[Prumnopitys andina|lleuque]] and the [[Dacrycarpus dacrydioides|kahikatea]]. Instead of the [[wood]]y [[Conifer cone|cone]] typical of most gymnosperms, the reproductive structure of the yew consists of a single seed that becomes surrounded by a fleshy, cup-like covering. This covering is derived from a highly modified cone scale.

==Development in ''Taxus''==
In European yew plants (''[[Taxus baccata]]''), the aril starts out as a small, green band at the base of the seed, then turns brown to red as it enlarges and surrounds the seed, eventually becoming fleshy and scarlet in color at maturity. The aril is attractive to fruit-eating [[bird]]s and is non-toxic (all other parts of the yew are toxic, including the seed housed inside the aril. If the seed is crushed or breaks/splits in the stomach of a bird, animal or human it will result in poisoning), This serves to promote dispersal of the yew seed by birds, which digest the fleshy aril as a food source, and pass the seed out in their droppings.

[[File:Taxus baccata MHNT.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The fleshy aril that surrounds each seed in the [[Taxus baccata|yew]] is a highly modified seed cone scale.]]

==In ''Dacrycarpus dacrydioides''==

The kahikatea tree, ''[[Dacrycarpus dacrydioides]]'', is native to [[New Zealand]]. In pre-European times the aril of the kahikatea was a food source for [[Māori people|Māori]]. The washed arils were called ''koroi'' and were eaten raw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.conifers.org/po/Dacrycarpus_dacrydioides.php |title=Dacrycarpus dacrydioides (kahikatea) description |work=conifers.org |year=2011 |quote='The small fruit (koroi) are superabundant and highly nutritious.

The '''Ashkenazum''' was an [[organized crime]] group active in [[Argentina]] in the first half of the 20th century. Ashkenazum was founded by [[Simon Rubinstein (pimp)|Simon Rubinstein]] as a splinter group from the larger [[Zwi Migdal]], an organized crime group that stretched across five continents and specialized in the sex trafficking of [[Eastern European]] [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] girls.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, Edward J. Prostitution and Prejudice: the Jewish Fight against White Slavery, 1870-1939. Schocken Books, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Rubinstein arrived in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1900 from [[Odessa]], and there he quickly acquired control of a condom factory. He was a notorious silk smuggler, and became affiliated with the Zwi Migdal. At the height of his operation, he had 700 agents in Argentina trafficking women for him.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Hilary.

[[File:Lamarck Compared to Darwin, Baldwin, Waddington.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|The Baldwin effect compared to [[Lamarckism|Lamarck's theory of evolution]], [[Darwinian evolution]], and Waddington's [[genetic assimilation]]. All the theories offer explanations of how organisms respond to a changed environment with adaptive inherited change.]]
In [[evolutionary biology]], the '''Baldwin effect''' describes the effect of learned behavior on evolution. In brief, [[James Mark Baldwin]] and others suggested during the [[eclipse of Darwinism]] in the late 19th century that an organism's ''ability to learn'' new behaviors (e.g. to acclimatise to a new stressor) will affect its reproductive success and will therefore have an effect on the genetic makeup of its species through [[natural selection]]. Though this process appears similar to [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian evolution]], Lamarck proposed that living things ''inherited'' their parents' acquired characteristics. The Baldwin effect has been independently proposed several times, and today it is generally recognized as part of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]].

=="A New Factor in Evolution"==
The effect, then unnamed, was put forward in 1896 in a paper "A New Factor in Evolution" by [[United States|American]] [[psychology|psychologist]] [[James Mark Baldwin]]. The paper proposed a mechanism for specific selection for general learning ability. As [[Robert J. Richards|Robert Richards]] explains:&lt;ref name=Richards1987&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Robert J. Richards|Richards, Robert J.]] | year=1987 | title=Darwin and the Emergence of Evolutionary Theories of Mind and Behavior| publisher=The University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago | isbn=0-226-71199-4 | page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If animals entered a new environment—or their old environment rapidly changed—those
that could flexibly respond by learning new behaviors or by ontogenetically adapting would
be naturally preserved. This saved remnant would, over several generations, have the
opportunity to exhibit spontaneously congenital variations similar to their acquired traits and
have these variations naturally selected. It would look as though the acquired traits had sunk
into the hereditary substance in a Lamarckian fashion, but the process would really be [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Selected offspring would tend to have an increased capacity for learning new skills rather than being confined to genetically coded, relatively fixed abilities. In effect, it places emphasis on the fact that the sustained behavior of a species or group can shape the evolution of that species. The "Baldwin effect" is better understood in [[evolutionary developmental biology]] literature as a scenario in which a character or [[biological trait|trait]] change occurring in an [[organism]] as a result of its interaction with its environment [[genetic assimilation|becomes gradually assimilated]] into its developmental genetic or epigenetic repertoire (Simpson, 1953; Newman, 2002). In the words of [[Daniel Dennett]],&lt;ref name=dennett03/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thanks to the Baldwin effect, species can be said to pretest the efficacy of particular different designs by phenotypic (individual) exploration of the space of nearby possibilities. If a particularly winning setting is thereby discovered, this discovery will ''create'' a new selection pressure: organisms that are closer in the adaptive landscape to that discovery will have a clear advantage over those more distant.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An update to the Baldwin Effect was developed by [[Jean Piaget]], [[Paul Alfred Weiss|Paul Weiss]], and [[Conrad Waddington]] in the 1960s–1970s. This new version included an explicit role for the social in shaping subsequent natural change in humans (both evolutionary and developmental), with reference to alterations of selection pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Burman J. T. | year = 2013 | title = Updating the Baldwin Effect: The biological levels behind Piaget's new theory | url = | journal = New Ideas in Psychology | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 363–373 | doi = 10.1016/j.newideapsych.2012.07.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is to be expected from [[Stigler's law]], subsequent research shows that Baldwin was not the first to identify the process; [[Douglas Spalding]] mentioned it in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, R.; [[Denis Noble|Noble, D.]] (2017) Was the Watchmaker Blind? Or Was She One-Eyed? ''Biology'' 2017, 6(4), 47; doi:10.3390/biology6040047, quoting Bateson, P. The adaptability driver: Links between behaviour and evolution. Biol. Theory 2006, 1, 342–345.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Suppose a species is threatened by a new [[predator]] and there is a behavior that makes it more difficult for the predator to kill individuals of the species. Individuals who learn the behavior more quickly will obviously be at an advantage. As time goes on, the ability to learn the behavior will improve (by genetic selection), and at some point it will seem to be an [[instinct]].

Baldwin gives the following case involving cooperation: "Animals may be kept alive let us say in a given environment by social cooperation only; these transmit this social type of variation to posterity; thus social adaptation sets the direction of physical phylogeny and physical heredity is determined in part by this factor" (Baldwin, 1896, p.&amp;nbsp;553).

The appearance of [[lactose intolerance|lactose tolerance]] in human populations with a long tradition of raising domesticated animals for milk production has been suggested as another example.{{by whom|date=May 2018}} This argument holds that a feedback loop operates whereby a dairy culture increases the selective advantage from this genetic trait, while the average population genotype increases the collective rewards of a dairy culture.

==Controversy and acceptance==

Initially Baldwin's ideas were not incompatible with the prevailing, but uncertain, ideas about the mechanism of transmission of hereditary information and at least two other biologists put forward very similar ideas in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morgan |first=C. L. |authorlink=C. Lloyd Morgan |year=1896 |title=On modification and variation |journal=Science|volume=4|pages=733–740 |doi=10.1126/science.4.99.733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Osborne |first=H.

(2003), "Baldwin Boosters, Baldwin Skeptics" in: {{cite book |title=Evolution and learning: The Baldwin effect reconsidered |last=Weber |first=Bruce H. |first2=David J. |last2=Depew |year=2003 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-262-23229-4 |pages=3–31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBtRzBilw1MC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=baldwin+effect#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was first called the "Baldwin effect" by [[George Gaylord Simpson]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="depew03" /&gt; Simpson "admitted that the idea was theoretically consistent, that is, not inconsistent with the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]",&lt;ref name="depew03" /&gt; but he doubted that the phenomenon occurred very often, or if so, could be proven to occur. In his discussion of the reception of the Baldwin-effect theory Simpson points out that the theory appears to provide a reconciliation between a neo-Darwinian and a [[Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckian]] approach and that "Mendelism and later genetic theory so conclusively ruled out the extreme neo-Lamarckian position that reconciliation came to seem unnecessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Baldwin effect |authorlink=George Gaylord Simpson |author=Simpson, George Gaylord |year=1953 |journal=Evolution |volume=7 | issue=2 |pages=110–117 |doi=10.2307/2405746}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, the evolutionary biologist [[Julian Huxley]] promoted the Baldwin effect as part of the modern synthesis, saying the concept had been unduly neglected by evolutionists.&lt;ref name=Julian1942&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Julian Huxley |author=Huxley, Julian |year=1942 |location=London |title=[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]] |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, the evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] contended that the Baldwin effect theory was untenable because
# the argument is stated in terms of the individual genotype, whereas what is really exposed to the selection pressure is a phenotypically and genetically variable population;
# it is not sufficiently emphasized that the degree of modification of the phenotype is in itself genetically controlled;
# it is assumed that phenotypic rigidity is selectively superior to phenotypic flexibility.&lt;ref name=Mayr1963&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Ernst Mayr |author=Mayr, Ernst |year=1963 |location=Cambridge, MA |title=Animal Species and Evolution|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-03750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 [[Geoffrey Hinton]] and Steven Nowlan demonstrated by computer simulation that learning can accelerate evolution, and they associated this with the Baldwin effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=How learning can guide evolution|authors=[[Geoffrey Hinton|Hinton, Geoffrey E.]]; Nowlan, Steven J. |year=1987 |journal=Complex Systems |volume=1 |pages=495–502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=When learning guides evolution|authorlink=John Maynard Smith |author=Maynard Smith, John |year=1987 |journal=Nature |volume=329 |pages=761–762 |doi=10.1038/329761a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Puentedura2003&gt;{{cite book| author=Puentedura, Ruben R. |year=2003|location=Cambridge, MA |chapter=The Baldwin effect in the age of computation |title=Evolution and Learning: The Baldwin Effect Reconsidered |editors=Weber,Bruce H.; Depew, David J.|publisher=MIT press |pages=219–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first is the role ''mind'' is understood to play in the effect. The second is the connection between ''development'' and evolution in the effect.

[[File:Carpodacus mexicanus -Madison, Wisconsin, USA-8.jpg|thumb|The [[house finch]]'s colonisation of North America has provided empirical evidence of the Baldwin effect.&lt;ref name=Badyaev/&gt;]]

Still, observes David Depew, "it is striking that a rather diverse lot of contemporary evolutionary theorists, most of whom regard themselves as supporters of the Modern Synthesis, have of late become 'Baldwin boosters{{'"}}&lt;ref name="depew03" /&gt; These Baldwin boosters

&lt;blockquote&gt;
are typically [[evolutionary psychologist]]s who are searching for scenarios in which a population can get itself by behavioral trial and error onto a "hard to find" part of the fitness landscape in which human brain, language, and mind can rapidly coevolve. They are searching for what [[Daniel Dennett]], himself a Baldwin booster, calls an "evolutionary crane," an instrument to do some heavy lifting fast.&lt;ref name="depew03" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Daniel Dennett]], recent work has rendered the Baldwin effect "no longer a controversial wrinkle in orthodox Darwinism".&lt;ref name="dennett03"&gt;[[Daniel Dennett|Dennett, Daniel]] (2003), "The Baldwin Effect, a Crane, not a Skyhook" in: {{cite book |title=Evolution and learning: The Baldwin effect reconsidered |last=Weber |first=Bruce H. |first2=David J. |last2=Depew |year=2003 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-262-23229-4 |pages=69–106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBtRzBilw1MC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=baldwin+effect#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential genetic mechanisms underlying the Baldwin effect have been proposed for the evolution of natural (genetically-determinant) antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Russell|date=1996|title=How the adaptive antibodies facilitate the evolution of natural antibodies|url=|journal=Immunology and Cell Biology|volume=74 | issue = 2 |pages=286–291|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, empirical evidence for the Baldwin effect was provided from the colonisation of North America by the [[house finch]].&lt;ref name=Badyaev&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Badyaev |first1=Alexander V. |title=Evolutionary significance of phenotypic accommodation in novel environments: an empirical test of the Baldwin effect |journal=Phil.

==Comparison with genetic assimilation==
{{further|Genetic assimilation}}

The Baldwin effect has been confused with, and sometimes conflated with, a different evolutionary theory also based on [[phenotypic plasticity]], [[C. H. Waddington]]'s [[genetic assimilation]]. The Baldwin effect includes genetic accommodation, of which one type is genetic assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Crispo | first1=Erika | year=2007 | title=The Baldwin effect and genetic assimilation: revisiting two mechanisms of evolutionary change mediated by phenotypic plasticity | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00203.x/full | journal=Evolution | volume=61 |  pages=2469–2479 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00203.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--more needed--&gt;

'''Bible Study Fellowship''' (also known as '''BSF''') is an international [[Christianity|Christian]] [[interdenominational]] or [[parachurch organization|parachurch fellowship]] of [[laity|lay people]] offering a system of structured [[biblical studies|bible study]]. It was begun in 1959 by [[Audrey Wetherell Johnson]], a British [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Christianity in China|to China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bsfinternational.org/bsf-history|title=Our history|website=Bible Study Fellowship|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The BSF system==
The BSF system of Bible study is highly organized and disciplined, and uses the technique of [[exegesis]] for [[Expository preaching|expository study]] of the [[Bible|scriptures]].  BSF holds classes for men, women, children and young adults in 35 countries (2006).  There are over 1100 classes worldwide.  Classes for adult men and women are single-sex, though classes for children (toddlers and infants in Day Women's classes, and for Grades 1-12 in Evening Men's and Women's classes) and young adults (aged 18–35) are not.  Each study lasts for approximately nine months, and over a nine-year cycle BSF classes cover [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], Life of [[Moses]], [[Gospel of John|John]], [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], Israel and the [[Minor prophet|Minor Prophets]], Revelation, and [[Acts of the Apostles]]. Beginning in 2018-2019, Israel and the Minor Prophets will be split into People of Promised Land Part 1 &amp; 2.

The BSF system involves four elements; daily questions to encourage personal Bible study, discussion groups (of up to 15 people) for sharing of personal answers to questions, a lecture by the class Teaching Leader covering the past week’s scripture with applications for daily living, and finally a set of notes reinforcing lessons from the previous week (plus a new set of questions for the week ahead).  BSF classes and materials are provided free of charge.

The same scripture is studied worldwide on the same week.  Participants who travel frequently can go to the BSF website and look up the place and the time where the BSF meets in a travel city.  Enrolled members from any BSF group may join another group when traveling.  They study the same scripture they would be studying if they had remained at home.  This enables consistent Bible Study for those whose careers keep them on the go. 

Often the Teaching Leader and the notes will present historical details obtained from external sources, as an aid to clearer understanding of the context and background of the scripture being studied.

Discussion groups are led by Group Leaders, who are specifically directed to avoid any formal teaching role (this being left to the [[Holy Spirit]] during member’s personal quiet times during the week, and the Teaching Leader in his/her lecture).  Group Leaders facilitate the discussions, and also perform a shepherding role with group members.  They attend a separate two-hour training session each week, which involves group discussion through each of the week’s questions and answers, and generally a sharing of [[homiletics]] (see links below) on the passage being studied. Group Leaders can pray with their group at the end of their discussion time.

==History==
BSF grew out of a program of structured Bible study that A. Wetherell Johnson,  a missionary with [[China Inland Mission]], agreed to run for a group of friends in California in 1952.  "In 1958, Ms. Johnson accepted an invitation to go to San Francisco to conduct [[Bible]] classes for the revival converts of [[Billy Graham]]'s neo-evangelical crusades."&lt;ref name="with"&gt;[http://www.withchrist.org/bsf.htm BSF International] from withchrist.org&lt;/ref&gt;  BSF began in 1959.

Upon Johnson's retirement, Rosemary Jensen became Executive Director (ED) and served for nearly twenty years.  In 2000, she began serving as the head of the Rafiki Foundation International which has since moved from San Antonio, TX to Eustis, FL and  Mrs. Jean Nystrand assumed the position of ED. In 2009, Susie Rowan took over as Executive Director.

==The aims==
The vision of BSF International reads "Worldwide training centers teaching the Bible to produce in all participants a vibrant relationship with God and, in as many as are called, a passion to commit without reservation to lead in the cause of Christ in the world."

The main aims of BSF International include:
*personal relationship with God
*daily Bible study
*know Christ in his fullness
*relate Bible study to daily life
*equip members to serve in churches
*help individuals communicate truth
*train Christian leadership
*support churches in the community
*teach preschool and school children
*aid and encourage families in the Christian training of their children.

==Board of directors==
In addition to BSF's [[executive director]] Susan Rowan, the organization has the following people on its [[board of director]]s:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsfinternational.org/About/Directors/tabid/65/Default.aspx BSF Board of Directors] from the BSF website&lt;/ref&gt;

Officers: 
* Mr. Bruce Smith (retired barrister), chairman 
* Mr. Anthony Tan (international businessman), vice chairman
* Mrs. Suzanne Sloan, secretary (former BSF Area Advisor)

Other members:
* Dr. John Amuasi (nuclear scientist and educator)
* Mr. Steve Gately (former BSF Business Manager)
* Dr. Walter Kaiser Jr. (former President, [[Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary]])
* Dr. Mark Bailey (President of [[Dallas Theological Seminary]])
* Judge Ron Rogg (lawyer and judge)

* Mrs. Pamela Bunn (former BSF Area Advisor)
* Mr. Michael Duke (Retired President &amp; CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.)
* Mrs. Lois McCall, Emeritus (former BSF Teaching Leader)

==Countries==
According to the organization's [[Form 990]] for the year ending August 31, 2006,&lt;ref name="form990"/&gt; BSF has offices in the USA, [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Kenya]], and [[Singapore]], and has a financial interest in the following 35 countries:

==Doctrinal positions and practices==

BSF has a statement of faith to which all leaders must agree.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bsfinternational.org/statement-of-faith BSF Statement of Faith] from the BSF website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ministrywatch.com/mw2.1/F_FullRpt.asp?EIN=941514010 BSF Statement of Faith] from ministrywatch.com&lt;/ref&gt;  It emphasizes [[salvation]] by [[divine grace|grace]] through [[faith]] ([[Epistle to the Ephesians|Eph]] 2:8) while encouraging a holy ([[sanctification|sanctified]]) lifestyle.

Any BSF participant who agrees to the BSF [[Statement of faith|Statement of Faith]], when that statement is not in conflict with the church they are a member of, can be called into leadership positions in BSF.  BSF is careful not to call someone into leadership where the profession of their faith as a member of their church would be conflict with the BSF Statement of Faith.

Biomimetic materials in tissue engineering are materials that have been designed such that they elicit specified cellular responses mediated by interactions with scaffold-tethered [[peptides]] from [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) [[protein]]s; essentially, the incorporation of cell-binding peptides into [[biomaterial]]s via chemical or physical modification.&lt;ref name="Biomimetic materials for tissue engineering"&gt;Shin, H., S.

These peptides are often referred to as "[[self-assembling peptide]]s", since they can be modified to contain biologically active [[Sequence motif|motif]]s. This allows them to replicate information derived from tissue and to reproduce the same information independently. Thus, these peptides act as building blocks capable of conducting multiple biochemical activities, including tissue engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cavalli |first1=Silvia |year=2009 |title=Amphiphilic peptides and their cross-disciplinary role as building blocks for nanoscience |journal=Chemical Society Reviews |publisher=Barcelona Science Park |doi=10.1039/b906701a |url=http://www.pcb.ub.edu/fama/pdf/Chem.%20Soc.%20Rev.,%202010,%2039,%20241.pdf |accessdate=3 October 2013 |volume=39 |pages=241–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that tissue engineering research currently being performed on both short chain and long chain peptides is still in early stages.

Such peptides include both native long chains of ECM proteins as well as short peptide sequences derived from intact ECM proteins. The idea is that the biomimetic material will mimic some of the roles that an ECM plays in [[neural tissue]]. In addition to promoting cellular growth and mobilization, the incorporated peptides could also mediate by specific [[protease]] enzymes or initiate cellular responses not present in a local native tissue.&lt;ref name="Biomimetic materials for tissue engineering"/&gt;

In the beginning, long chains of ECM proteins including [[fibronectin]] (FN), [[vitronectin]] (VN), and [[laminin]] (LN) were used, but more recently the advantages of using short peptides have been discovered. Short peptides are more advantageous because, unlike the long chains that fold randomly upon adsorption causing the active [[protein domains]] to be [[Steric effects|sterically]] unavailable, short peptides remain stable and do not hide the [[Ligand (biochemistry)|receptor binding]] domains when adsorbed. Another advantage to short peptides is that they can be replicated more economically due to the smaller size. A bi-functional cross-linker with a long spacer arm is used to tether peptides to the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] surface. If a [[functional group]] is not available for attaching the cross-linker, [[photochemical]] immobilization may be used.&lt;ref name="Biomimetic materials for tissue engineering"/&gt;

In addition to modifying the surface, biomaterials can be modified in bulk, meaning that the [[cell signaling]] peptides and recognition sites are present not just on the surface but also throughout the bulk of the material. The strength of cell attachment, cell migration rate, and extent of [[cytoskeletal]] organization formation is determined by the receptor binding to the [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] bound to the material; thus, receptor-ligand affinity, the density of the ligand, and the spatial distribution of the ligand must be carefully considered when designing a biomimetic material.&lt;ref name="Biomimetic materials for tissue engineering"/&gt;

==Biomimetic mineralization==
Proteins of the developing enamel extracellular matrix (such as [[Amelogenin]]) control initial mineral deposition ([[nucleation]]) and subsequent crystal growth, ultimately determining the physico-mechanical properties of the mature mineralized tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://cro.sagepub.com/content/6/2/84.short | title=Molecular Mechanisms of Dental Enamel Formation |author1=Simmer, J.P.  |author2=Fincham, A. G.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Critical Reviews in Oral Biology &amp; Medicine | year=1995 | volume=6 | issue=2 | pages=84–108 | doi=10.1177/10454411950060020701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutations in enamel ECM proteins result in enamel defects such as amelogenesis imperfect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03008200390152124 | title=Relationship of phenotype and genotype in X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta |author1=Wright, J. T. |author2=Hart, P. S. | journal=Connective Tissue Research | year=2003 | volume=44 | issue=1 | pages=72–78 | doi=10.1080/03008200390152124|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jdr.sagepub.com/content/84/3/278.short | title=ENAM Mutations in Autosomal-dominant Amelogenesis Imperfecta |author1=Kim, J. W. |author2=Seymen, F. | journal=Journal of Dental Research |date=March 2005 | volume=84 | issue=3 | pages=278–282 | doi=10.1177/154405910508400314|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Type-I collagen]] is thought to have a similar role for the formation of dentin and bone.

Nucleators bring together mineral ions from the surrounding fluids (such as saliva) into the form of a crystal lattice structure, by stabilizing small nuclei to permit crystal growth, forming mineral tissue.

Dental enamel mineral (as well as [[dentin]] and bone) is made of [[hydroxylapatite]] with foreign ions incorporated in the structure.

[[Carbonate]], [[fluoride]], and [[magnesium]] are the most common heteroionic substituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dental enamel formation to destruction | publisher=CRC |author1=Robinson, C. |author2=Kirkham, J. |author3= Shore, R. | year=1995 | location=Boca Raton | isbn=978-0849345890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a biomimetic mineralization strategy based on normal enamel [[histogenesis]], a three-dimensional scaffold is formed to attract and arrange calcium and/or phosphate ions to induce de novo precipitation of hydroxylapatite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr8004422?journalCode=chreay | title=Biomimetic systems for hydroxyapatite mineralization inspired by bone and enamel |author1=Palmer, L. C. |author2=Newcomb, C. J. | journal=Chemical Reviews |date=November 2008 | volume=108 | issue=11 | pages=4754–4783 | doi=10.1021/cr8004422|display-authors=etal | pmid=19006400 | pmc=2593885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two general strategies have been applied. One is using fragments known to support natural mineralization proteins, such as Amelogenin, Collagen, or Dentin Phosphophoryn as the basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.jbc.org/content/286/23/20228.short | title=Expression of phosphophoryn is sufficient for the induction of matrix mineralization by mammalian cells |author1=Sfeir, C. |author2=Lee, D. | journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry |date=February 2011 | volume=286 | pages=20228–20238 | doi=10.1074/jbc.M110.209528|display-authors=etal | pmid=21343307 | pmc=3121506}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Alternatively, de novo macromolecular structures have been designed to support mineralization, not based on natural molecules, but on rational design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://jdr.sagepub.com/content/86/5/426.short | title=Self-assembling peptide scaffolds promote enamel remineralization |author1=Kirkham, J. |author2=Firth, A. | journal=Journal of Dental Research |date=May 2007 | volume=86 | issue=5 | pages=426–430 | doi=10.1177/154405910708600507|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extracellular matrix proteins ==
Many studies utilize laminin-1 when designing a biomimetic material. Laminin is a component of the extracellular matrix that is able to promote neuron attachment and differentiation, in addition to [[axon]] growth guidance. Its primary functional site for bioactivity is its core protein domain [[isoleucine]]-[[lysine]]-[[valine]]-[[alanine]]-[[valine]] (IKVAV), which is located in the α-1 chain of laminin.&lt;ref name="Self-assembled IKVAV peptide nanofibers promote adherence of PC12 cells"&gt;Wu, Y., et al., ''Self-assembled IKVAV peptide nanofibers promote adherence of PC12 cells''. Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 2006. 26(5): p. 594-596.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study by Wu, Zheng et al., synthesized a self-assembled IKVAV peptide nanofiber and tested its effect on the adhesion of neuron-like [[pc12 cells]]. Early cell adhesion is very important for preventing cell degeneration; the longer cells are suspended in culture, the more likely they are to degenerate. The purpose was to develop a [[biomaterial]] with good cell adherence and bioactivity with IKVAV, which is able to inhibit [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]] and adhesion of glial cells in addition to promoting neuronal [[cell adhesion]] and differentiation.&lt;ref name="Self-assembled IKVAV peptide nanofibers promote adherence of PC12 cells"/&gt; The IKVAV peptide domain is on the surface of the nanofibers so that it is exposed and accessible for promoting cell contact interactions. The IKVAV nanofibers promoted stronger cell adherence than the electrostatic attraction induced by [[poly-L-lysine]], and cell adherence increased with increasing density of IKVAV until the saturation point was reached. IKVAV does not exhibit time dependent effects because the adherence was shown to be the same at 1 hour and at 3 hours.&lt;ref name="Self-assembled IKVAV peptide nanofibers promote adherence of PC12 cells"/&gt;

Laminin is known to stimulate [[neurite]] outgrowth and it plays a role in the developing nervous system. It is known that gradients are critical for the guidance of [[growth cones]] to their target tissues in the developing [[nervous system]]. There has been much research done on soluble gradients; however, little emphasis has been placed on gradients of substratum bound substances of the extracellular matrix such as laminin.&lt;ref name="Anisotropic scaffolds facilitate enhanced neurite extension"&gt;Dodla, M.C. and R.V. Bellamkonda, ''Anisotropic scaffolds facilitate enhanced neurite extension "in vitro"''. Journal of Biomedical Materials Research. Part A, 2006. 78: p. 213-221.&lt;/ref&gt; Dodla and Bellamkonda, fabricated an anisotropic 3D agarose gel with gradients of coupled laminin-1 (LN-1). Concentration gradients of LN-1 were shown to promote faster neurite extension than the highest neurite growth rate observed with isotropic LN-1 concentrations. Neurites grew both up and down the gradients, but growth was faster at less steep gradients and was faster up the gradients than down the gradients.&lt;ref name="Anisotropic scaffolds facilitate enhanced neurite extension"/&gt;

== Biomimetic artificial muscles ==
[[Electroactive polymers]] (EAPs) are also known as artificial muscles. EAPs are polymeric materials and they are able to produce large deformation when applied in an electric field. This provides large potential in applications in biotechnology and robotics, sensors, and actuators.&lt;ref name="Biomimetic Robotic Artificial Muscles"&gt;Kim, K.J. et al.

A special, reversal form of [[drug delivery]] where modulation of active migratory behaviour of the target cells is used to achieve targeted effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Láng, O. | author2= Török, K. | author3= Mező, G. | author4= Hudecz F. | author5= Kőhidai, L.| title= Chemotactic conjugates New Aspects in Drug-Targeting.| year=2003 | volume= | pages=118|pmid= | doi=| work=Cellular transport Strategies for Targeting of Epitopes, drugs and Reporter Molecules}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general components of the conjugates are designed as follows: (i) carrier – regularly possessing promoter effect also on internalization into the cell; (ii) chemotactically active ligands acting on the target cells; (iii) drug to be delivered in a selective way and (iv) spacer sequence which joins drug molecule to the carrier and due to it enzyme labile moiety makes possible the intracellular compartment specific release of the drug.

[[Image:Chemotactic drug-targeting.png|center|500 px|&lt;div style="text-align: center;border:none"&gt;Chemotactic drug-targeting&lt;/div&gt;]]

Careful selection of chemotactic component of the ligand not only the [[chemoattractant]] character could be expended, however, [[chemorepellent]] ligands are also valuable as they are useful to keep away cell populations degrading the conjugate containing the drug.

This mechanism of drug delivery is currently being studied.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7603">A '''discontinuity''' in [[geotechnical engineering]] (in geotechnical literature often denoted by '''joint''') is a plane or surface that marks a change in physical or chemical characteristics in a soil or rock mass. A discontinuity can be, for example, a [[Bed (geology)|bedding]], [[schist]]osity, [[Foliation (geology)|foliation]], [[Joint (geology)|joint]], [[Cleavage (geology)|cleavage]], [[Fracture (geology)|fracture]], [[Fracture (geology)|fissure]], crack, or [[Fault (geology)|fault]] plane. A division is made between '''mechanical''' and '''integral''' discontinuities. Discontinuities may occur multiple times with broadly the same mechanical characteristics in a '''discontinuity set''', or may be a '''single discontinuity'''. A discontinuity makes a soil or rock mass anisotropic.&lt;ref name=ISRMbluebook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price/&gt;&lt;ref name=Laubscher/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hack/&gt;&lt;ref name=HackPriceRengers/&gt;

==Mechanical==
A '''mechanical discontinuity''' is a plane of physical weakness where the [[tensile strength]] perpendicular to the discontinuity or the [[Shear strength (Discontinuity)|shear strength]] along the discontinuity is lower than that of the surrounding soil or rock material.

==Integral==
An '''integral discontinuity''' is a discontinuity that is as strong as the surrounding soil or rock material. Integral discontinuities can change into mechanical discontinuities due to physical or chemical processes (e.g. [[weathering]]) that change the mechanical characteristics of the discontinuity.

==Set or family==
Various geological processes create discontinuities at a broadly regular spacing. For example, [[Bed (geology)|bedding planes]] are the result of a repeated [[sedimentation]] cycle with a change of sedimentation material or change in structure and texture of the sediment at regular intervals, [[Fold (geology)|folding]] creates [[Joint (geology)|joints]] at regular separations to allow for shrinkage or expansion of the rock material, etc. Normally discontinuities with the same origin have broadly the same characteristics in terms of [[Shear strength (Discontinuity)|shear strength]],&lt;ref name=BartonChoubey/&gt;&lt;ref name=HackPrice1995/&gt; spacing between discontinuities,&lt;ref name=PriestHudson/&gt; roughness, infill, etc. The orientations of discontinuities with the same origin are related to the process that has created them and to the geological history of the rock mass. A '''discontinuity set or family''' denotes a series of discontinuities for which the geological origin (history, etc.), the orientation, spacing, and the mechanical characteristics ([[Shear strength (Discontinuity)|shear strength]], roughness, infill material, etc.) are broadly the same.

A discontinuity may exist as a single feature (e.g. fault, isolated joint or fracture) and in some circumstances, a discontinuity is treated as a '''single discontinuity''' although it belongs to a discontinuity set, in particular if the spacing is very wide compared to the size of the engineering application or to the size of the geotechnical unit.

==Characterization==
Various international standards exist to describe and characterize discontinuities in geomechanical terms, such as ISO 14689-1:2003&lt;ref name=ISO2003/&gt; and ISRM.&lt;ref name=ISRMbluebook/&gt;

[[Image:Swordfish skeleton.jpg|thumb|200px|Endoskeleton of a [[swordfish]]]]

An '''endoskeleton''' (From Greek ἔνδον, éndon = "within", "inner" + σκελετός, skeletos = "skeleton") is an internal support structure of an [[animal]], composed of [[mineralized tissues|mineralized tissue]].

==Overview==
An endoskeleton is a skeleton that is on the inside of a body. The endoskeleton develops within the skin or in the deeper body tissues. The vertebrate endoskeleton is basically made up of two types of tissues ([[bone]] and [[cartilage]]). During early embryonic development the endoskeleton is composed of [[notochord]] and cartilage. The notochord in most vertebrates is replaced by the vertebral column and cartilage is replaced by bone in most adults. In three [[phylum|phyla]] and one [[Class (biology)|subclass]] of animals, endoskeletons of various complexity are found: [[Chordata]], [[Echinoderm]]ata, [[Porifera]], and [[Coleoidea]]. An endoskeleton may function purely for support (as in the case of [[Porifera|sponges]]), but often serves as an attachment site for muscle and a mechanism for transmitting muscular forces. A true endoskeleton is derived from [[Germ layer#Mesoderm|mesodermal]] tissue. Such a [[skeleton]] is present in echinoderms and chordates. The poriferan 'skeleton' consists of microscopic calcareous or siliceous [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s or a [[spongin]] network. The Coleoidae do not have a true endoskeleton in the evolutionary sense; there, a [[mollusk]] [[exoskeleton]] [[evolution|evolved]] into several sorts of internal structure, the "cuttlebone" of [[cuttlefish]] being the best-known version. Yet they do have cartilaginous tissue in their body, even if it is not mineralized, especially in the head, where it forms a primitive cranium.The endoskeleton gives shape, support, and protection to the body and provides a means of locomotion.

'''Epoxide hydrolase 3''' ('''ABHD9''', '''EH3''', '''EPHX3'''), encoded by the ''EPHX3'' gene, is the third defined [[isozyme]] in a set of [[epoxide hydrolase]] [[isozymes]], i.e. the [[epoxide hydrolase]]s.  This set includes the [[Microsomal epoxide hydrolase]] (also termed epoxide hydrolase 1, EPHX1, mEH, and EH1); the [[epoxide hydrolase 2]] (also termed soluble epoxide hydrolase, EPHX2, sEH and EH2); and the far less well defined enzymatically, epoxide hydrolase 4 (also termed ABHD7 and EH4). All four enzyme contain an [[Alpha/beta hydrolase fold]] suggesting that they have [[Hydrolysis]] activity. EH1, EH2, and EH3 have been shown to have such activity in that they add water to [[epoxide]]s of [[unsaturated fatty acids]] to form [[vicinal (chemistry)|vicinal]] cis (see [[cis-trans isomerism]]) products; the activity of EH4 has not been reported. The former three EH's differ in subcellular location, tissue expression patterns, substrate preferences, and thereby functions. These functions include limiting the biologically actions of certain fatty acid epoxides, increasing the toxicity of other fatty acid epoxides, and contributing to the metabolism of drugs and other [[xenobiotic]]s.

==History==
EH3 was first named ABHD9 owing to its possession of a particular [[Protein domain]], the [[Alpha/beta hydrolase fold]] or α/β hydrolase fold domain. This domain is found in more than 30 other human [[hydrolytic enzymes]] including the four epoxide hydrolases. The gene for EH3 (''EPHX3'') was discovered on chromosome locus 19p13.13 in sequencing the human.[[genome]] &lt;ref name="genenames"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/gene_symbol_report?hgnc_id=HGNC:23760|title=EPHX3 Symbol Report &amp;#124; HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee|publisher=genenames.org|accessdate=2016-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on its amino acid sequence, it was projected to encode a protein with an α/β hydrolase fold domain; the encoded protein was therefore dubbed ABHD9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strausberg RL, Feingold EA, Grouse LH, Derge JG, Klausner RD, Collins FS, Wagner L, Shenmen CM, Schuler GD, Altschul SF, Zeeberg B, Buetow KH, Schaefer CF, Bhat NK, Hopkins RF, Jordan H, Moore T, Max SI, Wang J, Hsieh F, Diatchenko L, Marusina K, Farmer AA, Rubin GM, Hong L, Stapleton M, Soares MB, Bonaldo MF, Casavant TL, Scheetz TE, Brownstein MJ, Usdin TB, Toshiyuki S, Carninci P, Prange C, Raha SS, Loquellano NA, Peters GJ, Abramson RD, Mullahy SJ, Bosak SA, McEwan PJ, McKernan KJ, Malek JA, Gunaratne PH, Richards S, Worley KC, Hale S, Garcia AM, Gay LJ, Hulyk SW, Villalon DK, Muzny DM, Sodergren EJ, Lu X, Gibbs RA, Fahey J, Helton E, Ketteman M, Madan A, Rodrigues S, Sanchez A, Whiting M, Madan A, Young AC, Shevchenko Y, Bouffard GG, Blakesley RW, Touchman JW, Green ED, Dickson MC, Rodriguez AC, Grimwood J, Schmutz J, Myers RM, Butterfield YS, Krzywinski MI, Skalska U, Smailus DE, Schnerch A, Schein JE, Jones SJ, Marra MA | display-authors = 6  | title = Generation and initial analysis of more than 15,000 full-length human and mouse cDNA sequences | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 | issue = 26 | pages = 16899–903 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12477932 | pmc = 139241 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.242603899 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 10 years later, ABHD9 was defined to possess the ability to hydrolyze certain fatty acid epoxides.&lt;ref name="pmid22798687"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Decker M, Adamska M, Cronin A, Di Giallonardo F, Burgener J, Marowsky A, Falck JR, Morisseau C, Hammock BD, Gruzdev A, Zeldin DC, Arand M | title = EH3 (ABHD9): the first member of a new epoxide hydrolase family with high activity for fatty acid epoxides | journal = Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 53 | issue = 10 | pages = 2038–45 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22798687 | pmc = 3435537 | doi = 10.1194/jlr.M024448 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22722082"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morisseau C | title = Role of epoxide hydrolases in lipid metabolism | journal = Biochimie | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 91–5 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 22722082 | pmc = 3495083 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2012.06.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expression==
Similar to mEH but unlike sEH, EH3 is membrane-bound enzyme.  Based on the expression of its [[mRNA]] in mouse tissue, EH3 has a very different distribution than mEH or sEH: EH3 expression is high in skin, lung, tongue, esophagus, and stomach; intermediate in pancreas and eye, visceral fat, lymph nodes, spleen, aortic arch, and heart; low in liver, kidney, testis, ovary intestine, and brain; and very low in skeletal muscle.&lt;ref name="pmid22798687"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22722082"/&gt; Its expression in human tissues has not yet been reported.

==Activity and function==
ABHD9 first drew attention is studies that validated that its gene, EPHX3, was hypermethylated on [[CpG site]]s in its [[Promoter (genetics)]] in human prostate cancer tissues, particularly in the tissues of more advanced or, base on morphological criteria (i.e. [[Gleason score]]), more aggressive diseases. This allows that the [[gene silencing]] of EPHX3 due to promoter hypermethylation may contribute to the onset and/or progression of prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stott-Miller M, Zhao S, Wright JL, Kolb S, Bibikova M, Klotzle B, Ostrander EA, Fan JB, Feng Z, Stanford JL | title = Validation study of genes with hypermethylated promoter regions associated with prostate cancer recurrence | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 1331–9 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24718283 | pmc = 4082437 | doi = 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-1000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar CpG site hypermethylations in the promoter of EPHX3 have been validated for [[colorectal]] [[adenocarcinomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oster B, Thorsen K, Lamy P, Wojdacz TK, Hansen LL, Birkenkamp-Demtröder K, Sørensen KD, Laurberg S, Orntoft TF, Andersen CL | title = Identification and validation of highly frequent CpG island hypermethylation in colorectal adenomas and carcinomas | journal = International Journal of Cancer | volume = 129 | issue = 12 | pages = 2855–66 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 21400501 | doi = 10.1002/ijc.25951 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As similar promoter methylation pattern, although not yet validated, was also found in human malignant [[melanoma]] tissues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Furuta J, Nobeyama Y, Umebayashi Y, Otsuka F, Kikuchi K, Ushijima T | title = Silencing of Peroxiredoxin 2 and aberrant methylation of 33 CpG islands in putative promoter regions in human malignant melanomas | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 66 | issue = 12 | pages = 6080–6 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16778180 | doi = 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-0157 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and human [[gastric cancer]] cell lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamashita S, Tsujino Y, Moriguchi K, Tatematsu M, Ushijima T | title = Chemical genomic screening for methylation-silenced genes in gastric cancer cell lines using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment and oligonucleotide microarray | journal = Cancer Science | volume = 97 | issue = 1 | pages = 64–71 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16367923 | doi = 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2006.00136.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies allow but certainly do not prove that the silencing of EPHX (i.e. failure to be expressed as ABHD9 protein) is involved in the development and/or progression of certain cancers in humans.

More recently, ABHD9 was characterized as possessing epoxy hydrolase activity for metabolizing [[epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]s (EETs) and epoxides of [[linoleic acid]] (i.e. [[vernolic acid]]s [also termed leukotoxins] to their corresponding diols.&lt;ref name="pmid22798687"/&gt; For example, it metabolizes one particular EET (14,15-epoxy-5Z,8Z,11Z-eicosatrienoic acid) as follows:

&lt;center&gt;
14,15-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  → 14,15-dihydroxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid
&lt;/center&gt;

In this particular reaction, the enzyme inactivates the EET and thereby may function to limit the biological activity of this as well as the other EETs upon which it acts in, for example, regulating blood pressure (see [[epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]s. In its hydrolysis one [[isomer]] of vernolic acid (12S,13R-epoxy-cis-9-octadecenoic acid)

&lt;center&gt;
12''S'',13''R''-epoxy-cis-9-octadecenoic acid + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  → 12''S'',13''R''-dihydroxy-9''Z''-octadecenoic acids 
&lt;/center&gt;

to a diol, however, the enzyme increases its toxicity in, for example, contributing to [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]]s (see [[vernolic acid]]).&lt;ref name="pmid22798687"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22722082"/&gt;  The enzyme thereby may function to limit the [[cell signaling]] activity of the EETs yet contribute to the toxic actions of linoleic acid epoxides.

While mEH and to a lesser extent sEH metabolize drugs, foreign toxic chemicals, and certain endogenous compounds that are not simple fatty acids (see [[Microsomal epoxide hydrolase]] and [[epoxide hydrolase 2]]), the activity of EH3 on such substrates, while likely, has not yet been reported.

The '''evo-devo gene toolkit''' is the small subset of [[gene]]s in an organism's [[genome]] whose products control the organism's [[developmental biology|embryonic development]]. '''Toolkit genes''' are central to the synthesis of [[molecular genetics]], [[palaeontology]], [[evolution]] and developmental biology in the science of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo).

==Toolkit==

Toolkit genes are highly [[conserved sequence|conserved]] among [[Phylum|phyla]], meaning that they are ancient, dating back to the [[Urbilaterian|last common ancestor of bilaterian animals]]. For example, that ancestor had at least 7 [[Pax genes]] for [[transcription factor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedrich|first1=Markus|title=Evo-Devo gene toolkit update: at least seven Pax transcription factor subfamilies in the last common ancestor of bilaterian animals Authors|journal=Evolution &amp; Development|date=2015|volume=17|issue=5|pages=255–257|doi=10.1111/ede.12137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts.  The majority of toolkit genes are components of signaling pathways, and encode for the production of transcription factors, [[cell adhesion]] proteins, cell surface [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] proteins (and signalling [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] that bind to them), and secreted [[morphogens]], all of these participate in defining the fate of undifferentiated cells, generating spatial and temporal patterns, which in turn form the [[body plan]] of the organism. Among the most important of the toolkit genes are those of the [[Hox gene]] cluster, or complex. Hox genes, transcription factors containing the more broadly distributed [[homeobox]] protein-binding DNA motif, function in patterning the body axis. Thus, by combinatorial specifying the identity of particular body regions, Hox genes determine where [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] and other [[Anatomy|body]] segments will grow in a developing [[embryo]] or [[larva]]. A [[wikt:paradigm|paradigm]]atic toolkit gene is ''Pax6/eyeless'', which controls [[eye]] formation in all animals. It has been found to produce eyes in mice and ''[[Drosophila]]'', even if mouse ''Pax6/eyeless'' was expressed in ''Drosophila''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Xu, P.X. |author2=Woo, I. |author3=Her, H. |author4=Beier, D.R. |author5=Maas, R.L. |year=1997 |title=Mouse Eya homologues of the Drosophila eyes absent gene require Pax6 for expression in lens and nasal placode |journal=Development |volume=124 |issue=1 |pmid=9006082 |pages=219–231 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that a big part of the morphological evolution undergone by organisms is a product of variation in the genetic toolkit, either by the genes changing their expression pattern or acquiring new functions. A good example of the first is the enlargement of the beak in Darwin's large ground-finch ([[large ground-finch|''Geospiza magnirostris'']]), in which the gene ''[[Bone morphogenetic protein|BMP]]'' is responsible for the larger beak of this bird, relative to the other finches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Abzhanov, A. |author2=Protas, M. |author3=Grant, B.R. |author4=Grant, P.R. |author5=Tabin, C.J. |year=2004 |title=Bmp4 and Morphological Variation of Beaks in Darwin's Finches |journal=Science |volume=305 |issue=5689| doi=10.1126/science.1098095 |pages=1462–1465 |pmid=15353802 |bibcode=2004Sci...305.1462A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of legs in [[snake]]s and other [[Squamata|squamates]] is another good example of genes changing their expression pattern. In this case the gene ''[[Dlx (gene)|Distal-less]]'' is very under-expressed, or not expressed at all, in the regions where limbs would form in other [[tetrapod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cohn, M.J. |author2=Tickle, C. |title=Developmental basis of limblessness and axial patterning in snakes |year=1999 |journal=Nature |volume=399 |pages=474–479 |pmid=10365960 |issue=6735 |doi=10.1038/20944 |bibcode=1999Natur.399..474C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1994, [[Sean B. Carroll]]'s team made the "groundbreaking" discovery that this same gene determines the [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespot pattern]] in [[butterfly]] [[wing]]s, showing that toolbox genes can change their function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Beldade, P. |author2=Brakefield, P.M. |author3=Long, A.D. |year=2002 |title=Contribution of Distal-less to quantitative variation in butterfly eyespots |journal=Nature |volume=415 |issue=6869 |pages=315–318 |pmid=11797007 |doi=10.1038/415315a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Werner|first1=Thomas|title=Leopard Spots and Zebra Stripes on Fruit Fly Wings|journal=Nature Education|date=2015|volume=8|issue=2|page=3|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-leopard-spots-and-zebra-stripes-on-fruit-131087142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean B. et al|title=Pattern formation and eyespot determination in butterfly wings|journal=Science|date=1994|volume=265|pages=109–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toolkit genes, as well as being highly conserved, also tend to evolve the same function [[Convergent evolution|convergently]] or [[Parallel Evolution|in parallel]]. Classic examples of this are the already mentioned ''Distal-less'' gene, which is responsible for appendage formation in both tetrapods and insects, or, at a finer scale, the generation of wing patterns in the butterflies ''[[Heliconius erato]]'' and ''[[Heliconius melpomene]]''. These butterflies&lt;!--just mentioned butterfly eyespots above, the same species?? If so, should merge paragraphs--&gt; are [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian mimics]] whose coloration pattern arose in different evolutionary events, but is controlled by the same genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Baxter, S.W. |author2=Papa, R. |author3=Chamberlain, N. |author4=Humphray, S.J. |author5=Joron, M. |author6=Morrison, C. |author7=ffrench-Constant, R.H. |author8=McMillan, W.O. |author9=Jiggins, C.D. |year=2008 |title=Convergent Evolution in the Genetic Basis of Mullerian Mimicry in Heliconius Butterflies |journal=Genetics |volume=180 |issue=3 |pages=1567–1577 | pmid=18791259 |pmc=2581958 | doi=10.1534/genetics.107.082982}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This supports [[Marc Kirschner]] and [[John C. Gerhart]]'s theory of [[Facilitated variation|Facilitated Variation]], which states that morphological evolutionary novelty is generated by regulatory changes in various members of a large set of conserved mechanisms of development and physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gerhart |first=John |last2=Kirschner |first2=Marc |year=2007 |title=The theory of facilitated variation |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | pmid=17494755 |volume=104 | pmc=1876433 |issue=suppl1 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701035104 |pages=8582–8589|bibcode=2007PNAS..104.8582G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Friedrich Miescher]] Laboratory''' (FML) of the [[Max Planck Society]] is a biological research institute located on the Society's campus in [[Tübingen]], Germany. It was founded in 1969 to offer highly qualified junior scientists in the area of biology an opportunity to establish independent research groups and pursue their own line of research within a five-year period (extensions possible). The group leaders are elected by a committee of scientists from diverse areas and institutions on the basis of a public tendering procedure. While at the FML, they can use modern, well-equipped laboratories and work in teams tailored to their ideas. The laboratory is not headed by a director. Instead, the group leaders take turns in representing the FML, and its administrative and organizational interests. Furthermore, all group leaders jointly manage the funds available to the laboratory.

There is no specification as to which kind of biological research should be conducted at the FML, and the focus of research changes with the appointment of each new group leader. In the past, research interests have included developmental biology, neurobiology, cell biology, psychology and many other areas of modern biology.

'''Historical institutionalism''' ('''HI''') is a [[new institutionalism|new institutionalist]] social science method that uses [[institutions]] to find sequences of social, political, economic [[behavior]] and [[Social change|change]] across time. It is a comparative approach to the study of all aspects of human [[organizations]] and does so by relying heavily on [[case studies]].

Borrowing from [[Charles Tilly]], historical institutionalism is a method apt for measuring "big structures, large processes, and [making] huge comparisons".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Tilly. (1984). "Big structures, Large Processes, and Huge Comparisons".&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical institutionalism has generated some of the most important books in the fields of sociology, political science and economics. In fact, some of these studies have inspired policy and its scholars have received numerous awards. Although historical institutionalism proper is fairly new (ca. 1979), it identifies with the great traditions in history, philosophy, politics, sociology and economics.

==Old and new institutionalism==
[[Institutions]] have been always central to [[social science]] but they have not been addressed with the same emphasis and manner in every approach. Before and after the turn of the twentieth century, several scholars were writing about institutions, but they had not developed a theory of institutions yet. Most of these approaches relied heavily on the study of formal institutions (i.e. the law) (see [[hermeneutics]]). Moreover, they were highly [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] and, thus, prescriptive (i.e. Weber prescribed the professionalization of bureaucracy in order to have a modern state). This is often called "old institutionalism".{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

During the 1950s, [[structural-functionalism]] blurred the study of institutions. They were more concerned about the variability of the [[modernization]] process across countries and about prescribing and generalizing at the systemic level rather than acknowledging the different paths that [[Development studies|development]] can take. (i.e. [[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]], ''The Civic Culture'').{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The new institutionalism begins with the works of [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]], ''Political Order in Changing Societies''; [[Barrington Moore]]'s, ''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy'', and more specifically [[Theda Skocpol]]'s, ''States and Social Revolutions''. These books spawned the new [[research program]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

As stated above, before HI arrived, institutions were only treated as the formal rules of behavior (i.e. the law). In contrast, historical institutionalism has loosened the definition of institutions. In this new approach, institutions can take the shape of a formal bureaucratic structure but also an ideology or an informal custom. The significance of this change of approach is that historical institutionalism denies that power and history have only one source as past approaches (i.e. the state) and has given agency to all kinds of social groups and behaviors (e.g. in ''[[Weapons of the Weak]]'', [[James C. Scott|James Scott]] acknowledges the power of "gossip" in political life.) In emphasizing the participation of all kind of groups, not just elites or the state, historical institutionalism offers a dynamic approach to history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Moreover, HI avoids prescription. On the contrary, since historical institutionalism is interested in the richness and different paths that a [[revolution]] or an [[economic reform]] can take given that different groups participate in each case, they are sensitive to the differences that can occur when following a particular political design (i.e. democracy). In that sense, it also avoids the teleological determinism of past approaches. For historical institutionalists, actors are both produced by, and are producers of, history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==The treatment of history==
Unlike most western scholars who preceded them, including [[classical liberalism|classical liberals]], [[classical Marxism|classical Marxists]], [[empiricism|empiricists]], [[dialectic]]al thinkers and [[positivism|positivists]], historical institutionalists do not accept that history necessarily develops in a straightforward, linear fashion. Instead, they examine the conditions under which a particular trajectory was followed and not others, a phenomenon that [[Gabriel Almond]] refers to as the "historical cure".&lt;ref&gt;Almond, Gabriel. (1956). "Comparative Political Systems." ''Journal of Politics'', 18, pp. 391-409&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, specifying why particular paths were ''not'' taken is as important as specifying the actual trajectory of history.

As opposed to the old institutionalists, they postulate that history will not necessarily lead to a "happy" outcome (i.e. "[[fascism]] or [[democracy]] as the end of history").

The most basic concept with which historical institutionalists work is the concept of [[path dependence]].&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2012. Options for moving beyond the canonical model of regional path dependence. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 36(1), pp.172-178. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2427.2011.01090.x/full&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Martin, R., 2012. (Re) Placing path dependence: a response to the debate. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 36(1), pp.179-192.&lt;/ref&gt; Theda Skocpol and Paul Pierson write that [[path dependence]] does not have yet a clear definition, but can express the idea that "outcomes at a 'critical juncture' trigger feedback mechanisms [negative or positive] that reinforce the recurrence of a particular pattern into the future". In their view, the significance of path dependence is that:

: "once actors have ventured far down a particular path, they are likely to find it very difficult to reverse course…The "path not taken" or the political alternatives that were once quite plausible may become irretrievably lost. 'Path dependence analysis' highlights the role of what [[Arthur Stinchcombe]] has termed 'historical causation' in which dynamics triggered by an event or process at one point in time reproduce themselves, even in the absence of the recurrence of the original event or process".&lt;ref&gt;Pierson, Paul &amp; Skocpol, Theda. 2002. "Historical Institutionalism in Contemporary Political Science", in Ira Katznelson &amp; Helen V. Milner (eds). Political Science: State of the Discipline. New York: W.W. Norton: 693-721.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related crux of historical institutionalism is that temporal sequences matter: outcomes depend upon the timing of [[exogenous]] factors (such as inter-state competition or economic crisis) in relation to particular institutional configurations (such as the level of [[bureaucratic]] professionalism or degree of state autonomy from class forces).&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp.388-396. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1068/d2310?journalCode=epda&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Theda Skocpol]] suggests that the [[democracy|democratic]] outcome of the [[English Civil War]] was a result of the fact that the comparatively weak English [[The Crown|Crown]] lacked the [[military]] capacity to fight the landed upper-class. In contrast, the rise of rapid [[industrialization]] and [[fascism]] in [[Prussia]] when faced with international security threats was because the Prussian state was a "highly bureaucratic and centralized agrarian state" composed by "men closely ties to landed [[notables]]".&lt;ref&gt;Skocpol, Theda. (1973). A Critical Review of Barrington Moore's Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy. "Politics and Society", 4(1), pp. 1-34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Ertman]], in his account of state building in [[medieval]] and early modern [[Europe]], argues that variations in the type of [[regime]] built in Europe during this period can be traced to one macro-international factor and two historical institutional factors. At the macro-structural level, the "timing of the onset of sustained geopolitical competition" created an atmosphere of insecurity that appeared best addressed by consolidating state power. The timing of the onset of competition is critical for Ertman's explanation. States that faced competitive pressures early had to consolidate through [[patrimonial structures]], since the development of modern bureaucratic techniques had not yet arrived. States faced with competitive pressures later could on the other hand, could take advantage of advancements in training and knowledge to promote a more technical oriented [[civil service]].&lt;ref&gt;Ertman, Thomas. (1997). "Birth of the Leviathan: Building States and Regimes in Medieval and Early Modern Europe". Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, Richard. (2002, October). "In Debate: The Casual Focus of Historical Institutionalism". Paper presented at Temple University course seminar on Authoritarian Regimes, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
Historical institutionalism is not a unified intellectual enterprise (see also [[new institutionalism]]). Some scholars are oriented towards treating history as the outcome of rational and purposeful behavior based on the idea of equilibrium (see [[rational choice]]). They rely heavily on quantitative approaches. Others, more qualitative oriented scholars, reject the idea of rationality and instead emphasize the idea that randomness and accidents matter in political and social outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;S. Steinmo, K. Thelen, and F. Longstreth, eds., Structuring Politics: Historical Institutionalism in Comparative Analysis, (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; There are unsolvable [[epistemological]] differences between both approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Robert et al. Analytic Narratives, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; However given the historicity of both approaches, and given their focus on institutions, both can fall under "historical institutionalism".
* It could be said that path dependence claims causality because every juncture must be considered causal to further developments. (i.e. Z couldn't occur without W, X and Y) In that sense, it is more deterministic than statistical analysis because the latter acknowledge only probabilistic relations among variables. "Correlation is not causation".
* Path dependence, in the economic sense, is also subjective because it involves the judgment of the researcher in determining which historical [[conjunctures]] had an effect on the outcome why others don't (selecting on the dependent variable).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The subjectivity becomes accentuated because one can claim that the smallest historical event can shape the larger outcomes. (For example, if a man got drunk, and the next morning, he was involved in manufacturing 20 rifles that were sent to the same regiment, the rifles would not aim right and the battle would be lost and then the war). Where should we trace the causal thread? How much history is needed?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13198">The '''Institut für Sexualwissenschaft''' was an early private [[sexology]] research institute in Germany from 1919 to 1933. The name is variously translated as ''Institute of Sex Research'', ''Institute of Sexology'', ''Institute for Sexology'' or ''Institute for the Science of Sexuality''. The Institute was a non-profit foundation situated in [[Tiergarten, Berlin]]. It was headed by [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. Since 1897 he had run the ''[[Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee]]'' ("Scientific-Humanitarian Committee"), which campaigned on conservative and rational grounds for [[gay rights]] and tolerance. The Committee published the long-running journal ''[[Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen]]''. Hirschfeld built a unique library on same-sex love and eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Oosterhuis. (Ed.) ''Homosexuality and Male Bonding in Pre-Nazi Germany: The Youth Movement, the Gay Movement, and Male Bonding Before Hitler's Rise: Original Transcripts from Der Eigene, the First Gay Journal in the World''.

The [[Nazi book burnings]] in Berlin included the archives of the Institute. After the Nazis gained control of Germany in the 1930s, the institute and its libraries were destroyed as part of a [[Censorship in Nazi Germany|Nazi government censorship]] program by youth brigades, who burned its books and documents in the street.&lt;ref name="Qualia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Sexology|url=http://www.qualiafolk.com/2011/12/08/institute-of-sexology/|website=qualiafolk.com|publisher=Qualia Folk|accessdate=18 January 2015|date=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and purpose==
[[File:Hedwig W. and friend (ca 1922).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Herbert W. (left) was a transgender friend of Magnus Hirschfeld, and lived for two years in Berlin under his chosen name. This photo is from Hirschfeld's ''Sexual Intermediates'' (1922).]]The ''Institute of Sex Research'' was opened in 1919 by [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and his collaborator [[Arthur Kronfeld]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgipt.org/gesch/kronf/kronf_e.htm ''In Memory of Arthur Kronfeld''])&lt;/ref&gt; a once famous psychotherapist and later professor at the [[Charité]]. As well as being a research library and housing a large archive, the Institute also included medical, psychological, and ethnological divisions, and a marriage and sex counseling office. The Institute was visited by around 20,000 people each year, and conducted around 1,800 consultations. Poorer visitors were treated for free. In addition, the institute advocated [[sex education]], [[contraception]], the treatment of [[sexually transmitted diseases]], and [[feminism|women's emancipation]], and was a pioneer worldwide in the call for civil rights and social acceptance for homosexual and [[transgender]] people.

The Institute became a point of scientific and research interest for many scientists of sexuality, as well as scientific, political and social reformers in Germany and Europe, particularly from socialist, liberal and social-democratic circles. In 1923 the Institute was visited by [[Nikolai Semashko (medicine)|Nikolai Semashko]], Commissar for Health in the Soviet Union. This was followed by numerous visits and research trips by health officials, political, sexual and social reformers, and scientific researchers from the Soviet Union interested in the work of Hirschfeld.&lt;ref&gt;Homosexual Desire in Revolutionary Russia: The Regulation of Sexual and Gender Dissent, Dan Healey, 2001, pp.132-133&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 a delegation from the institute, led by Hirschfeld, reciprocated with a research visit to Moscow. In 1929 Hirschfeld presided over the third international congress of the [[World League for Sexual Reform]] at [[Wigmore Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Times]], ''League For Sexual Reform International Congress Opened'', 9 September 1929;&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Transgender pioneers==
Magnus Hirschfeld coined the term [[transsexualism]],&lt;ref&gt;Ekins R., King D. (2001) ''Pioneers of Transgendering: The Popular Sexology of David O. Cauldwell.'' IJT 5,2 ([http://www.symposion.com/ijt/cauldwell/cauldwell_01.htm  text online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428021447/http://www.symposion.com/ijt/cauldwell/cauldwell_01.htm |date=2006-04-28 }})&lt;/ref&gt; identifying the clinical category which his colleague [[Harry Benjamin]] would later develop in the United States. Transgender people were on the staff of the Institute, as well as being among the clients there. Various endocrinologic and surgical services were offered, including the first modern sex reassignment surgeries in the 1930s. Hirschfeld also worked with Berlin's police department to curtail the arrest of cross-dressed individuals, including those suspected of wearing certain clothing in connection with sex work, through the creation of [[transvestite]] passes issued on behalf of the Institute to those who had a personal desire to wear clothing associated with a gender other than the one assigned to them at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aO7YCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=gay+berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ7az2qKHWAhVETSYKHWznCn0QuwUIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Gay Berlin: Birthplace of a Modern Identity|last=Beachy|first=Robert|date=2015|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=|isbn=0307473139|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/12/17/371424790/between-world-wars-gay-culture-flourished-in-berlin|title=Between World Wars, Gay Culture Flourished In Berlin|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They later attacked it, looting the archives, and setting afire much of the material.|alt=|left]]
[[Image:Vitahomosexualis.JPG|thumb|''Vita homosexualis'', a 1902 collection of August Fleischmann’s popular pamphlets on [[third gender]] and against [[§175]] - a [[Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee]] library copy, confiscated on 6 May 1933, annotated on the endpaper: ''By [[Reichspräsident]]’s [[Reichstag Fire Decree|decree of 28.02.1933]] destined [[Nazi_book_burnings|for destruction]]!'' and hidden from the publique (label "Secr.") as [[Nazi plunder]] by the [[Prussian State Library]].

This book, and other that may have survived the destruction of the Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee and the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft, are sought after by the Magnus-Hirschfeld-Gesellschaft in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://magnus-hirschfeld.de/bibliothek-und-archiv/sammlungsschwerpunkte/gesucht-und-gefunden/|title=Dinge, die wir suchen|website=magnus-hirschfeld.de|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
]]In late February 1933, as the influence of [[Ernst Röhm]] weakened, the Nazi Party launched its purge of gay (then known as ''[[homophile]]'') clubs in Berlin, outlawed sex publications, and banned organised [[gay]] groups. As a consequence, many fled Germany (including, for instance, [[Erika Mann]]). In March 1933 the Institute's main administrator, [[Kurt Hiller]], was sent to a concentration camp. The buildings were later taken over by the Nazis for their own purposes. They were a bombed-out ruin by 1944, and were demolished sometime in the mid-1950s. Hirschfeld tried, in vain, to re-establish his Institute in Paris, but he died in France in 1935.

On 6 May 1933, while Hirschfeld was in [[Ascona]], Switzerland, the ''[[Deutsche Studentenschaft]]'' made an organised attack on the Institute of Sex Research. A few days later, the Institute's library and archives were publicly hauled out and [[Nazi book burnings|burned]] in the streets of the [[Opernplatz (Berlin)|Opernplatz]]. Around 20,000 books and journals, and 5,000 images, were destroyed. Also seized were the Institute's extensive lists of names and addresses. In the midst of the burning, [[Joseph Goebbels]] gave a political speech to a crowd of around 40,000 people. The leaders of the Deutsche Studentenschaft also proclaimed their own ''Feuersprüche'' (fire decrees). Also books by Jewish writers, and pacifists such as [[Erich Maria Remarque]], were removed from local public libraries and the [[Humboldt University]], and were burned.&lt;ref&gt;Leonidas Hill (2001). "The Nazi Attack on 'Un-German' Literature, 1933-1945" IN: ''The Holocaust and the Book: Destruction and Preservation''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many fled into exile, the radical activist [[Adolf Brand]] made a stand in Germany for five months after the book burnings, but in November 1933 he was forced to announce the formal end of the organised homosexual emancipation movement in Germany. On 28 June 1934 Hitler conducted a purge of gay men in the ranks of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] wing of the Nazis, which involved murdering them in the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. This was then followed by stricter laws on homosexuality and the round-up of gay men. The address lists seized from the Institute are believed to have aided Hitler in these actions. Many tens of thousands of arrestees found themselves, ultimately, in slave-labour or death camps. Karl Giese committed suicide in 1938 when the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia and his heir, lawyer Karl Fein, was murdered in 1942 during deportation.

==After World War II==
The charter of the institute had specified that in the event of dissolution, any assets of the Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld Foundation (which had sponsored the Institute since 1924) were to be donated to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. Hirschfeld also wrote a personal will while in exile in Paris, leaving any remaining assets to his students and heirs Karl Giese and Li Shiu Tong (Tao Li) for the continuation of his work. However, neither stipulation was carried out. The West German courts found that the foundation's dissolution and the seizure of property by the Nazis in 1934 was legal. The West German legislature also retained the Nazi amendments to [[Paragraph 175]], making it impossible for surviving gay men to claim restitution for the destroyed cultural center.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Steakley. ''The Early Homosexual Emancipation Movement in Germany''. (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

Li Shiu Tong lived in Switzerland and the United States until 1956, but as far as is known, he did not attempt to continue Hirschfeld's work. Some remaining fragments of data from the library were later collected by [[W. Dorr Legg]] and [[ONE, Inc.]] in the USA in the 1950s.

== Later developments ==
[[Image:Berlin hirschfeld gedenktafel.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Memorial to [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and his Institute for Sex Research, Berlin [[Tiergarten (park)|Tiergarten]], 2005]]
In 1973 a new ''Institut für Sexualwissenschaft'' was opened at the University of Frankfurt am Main (director: [[Volkmar Sigusch]]), and 1996 at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].

Located in Potsdam, Germany, the '''Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS)''' aims to identify and promote development pathways for a global transformation towards a sustainable society. The IASS employs a transdisciplinary approach that encourages dialogue to understand sustainability issues and generate potential solutions in cooperation with partners from the sciences, politics, the economy, and civil society. A strong network of national and international partners supports the work of the Institute. Its central research topics include the energy transition, emerging technologies, climate change, air quality, systemic risks, governance and participation, and cultures of transformation in the Anthropocene.&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwfk.brandenburg.de/cms/detail.php/bb1.c.263439.de|title=IASS Potsdam - MWFK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The IASS currently employs around 120 persons, including Fellows from over 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iass-potsdam.de/sites/default/files/files/150203_activity_deutsch_interaktiv_doppelseiten.pdf IASS Activities 2012–2013], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the Board of Directors was composed of the Institute's three Scientific Directors – [[Mark G. Lawrence]], [[Patrizia Nanz]] and [[Ortwin Renn]] – and its Head of Administration, Katja Carson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/news-media/news/patrizia-nanz-joins-iass-scientific-director-new-leadership-team-takes-helm|title=Patrizia Nanz Joins IASS as Scientific Director – New Leadership Team Takes the Helm - IASS Potsdam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IASS receives funding from the German [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry for Education and Research]] (85%) and the [[Brandenburg|Federal State of Brandenburg]] (15%). The Institute's research programme currently spans five areas: [[Energy transition|Transformation of Energy Systems]], Air Quality in the Context of Global Change, [[Sustainability Governance]], [[Emerging Technologies and Social Transformations in the Anthropocene]], and [[Economics and Culture]]. These research areas are supported in their work by the Cross-cutting Unit on Transdisciplinarity and Transformation, which is tasked with driving the development of theory and methodology at the IASS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/institute/idea/structure-bodies|title=Structure &amp; Bodies - IASS Potsdam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IASS is a registered voluntary association under German law. The Institute's supervisory, governing, and advisory bodies are its General Assembly, Board of Directors and Advisory Board.

== History ==
The IASS was founded in [[Potsdam]], Germany, on 2 February 2009. Germany politician and environmental policy expert [[Klaus Töpfer]] was the Institute's founding director. He led the Institute as its executive director until September 2015, together with scientific directors [[Carlo Rubbia]] (June 2010 – May 2015) and [[Mark G. Lawrence]] (from October 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/news-media/news/klaus-topfer-bids-farewell-iass-established-platform-dialogue-between-science-and|title=Klaus Töpfer Bids Farewell: IASS Established as a Platform for Dialogue between Science and Society - IASS Potsdam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a founding symposium held under the patronage of Angela Merkel, the then [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Minister of Education and Research]] [[Annette Schavan]] stated: "Under Professor Töpfer's leadership, the Institute will be able to gain international prominence and underscore Germany's strong position in this field."

The idea for the IASS was born in 2007 at the Potsdam Nobel Laureate Symposium "Global Sustainability – A Nobel Cause". The symposium brought together leading researchers and decision-makers and resulted in the publication of the widely regarded [[Potsdam Memorandum]], which called for a concerted effort to tap into "all sources of ingenuity" to address the challenges of the twenty-first century. The memorandum urged the establishment of a new "global contract" between science and society to bring together relevant knowledge within and beyond the science system to meet challenges to sustainability arising in the Anthropocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iass-potsdam.de/en/institute-advanced-sustainability-studies|title=Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies - IASS Potsdam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cooperation ==
The IASS collaborates with numerous partners in Germany and abroad. Its major regional partners include the University of Potsdam, [[GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences]], a research centre operated by the [[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research]], and [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5099">'''Jurgis Baltrušaitis''' (May 7, 1903 – January 25, 1988) was a [[Lithuania]]n [[art historian]], [[art critic]] and a founder of comparative art research. He was the son of the poet and diplomat [[Jurgis Baltrušaitis]]. Most of his works were written in [[French language|French]], although he always stressed his Lithuanian origin. After Lithuania was occupied by the [[USSR]] in 1945, he served as a diplomat in exile.

==Biography==
Baltrušaitis was born in [[Moscow]]. During his childhood he was immersed in the intense cultural life of his parents. One of his first teachers was the Russian poet and writer [[Boris Pasternak]].

In 1924 he moved to [[Paris]] and began theater studies at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] under the guidance of Professor [[Henri Focillon]]. Under his influence Baltrušaitis chose to study the history of art. He went on to do research in [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], and [[Germany]], receiving a [[doctorate]] from the Sorbonne in 1931. Later that year he became the cultural attache at the Lithuanian Legation in Paris.

Between 1933 and 1939 Baltrušaitis taught art history at the University of Kaunas, as well as lecturing at the Sorbonne and at the [[Warburg Institute]] in [[London]].

After [[World War II]] he delivered lectures at [[New York University]], [[Yale University]], [[Harvard University]], and at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

His diplomatic efforts included writing for the French press on Lithuanian issues, and representing Lithuania in international organizations such as the ''Académie Internationale des Sciences et des Lettres'' and the Lithuanian Legation in Paris.

Baltrušaitis died in Paris.

The '''Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics''' ('''KITP''') is a research institute of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. KITP is one of the most renowned institutes for [[theoretical physics]] in the world, and brings theorists in physics and related fields together to work on topics at the forefront of theoretical science. The [[National Science Foundation]] has been the principal supporter of the Institute since it was founded as the Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1979. In a 2007 article in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', KITP was given the highest impact index in a comparison of nonbiomedical research organizations across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/104/46/17943.full National scientific facilities and their impact on nonbiomedical research]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Directors of the KITP since its beginning have been:
* [[Walter Kohn]], 1979–1984 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;(Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1998)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[Robert Schrieffer]], 1984–1989 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;(Nobel Prize for Physics, 1972)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[James S. Langer]], 1989–1995
* [[James Hartle]], 1995–1997 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;([[Einstein Prize (APS)]], 2009)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[David Gross]], 1997–2012 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;(Nobel Prize in Physics, 2004)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[Lars Bildsten]], 2012–present

The Director and the permanent members of the KITP (Leon Balents, David Gross, Alexei Kitaev, Joseph Polchinski, and Boris Shraiman) are also on the faculty of the [[UC Santa Barbara Physics Department]].  Former permanent members include Physics Nobel Laureate [[Frank Wilczek]].

In the early 2000s, the institute, formerly known as the Institute for Theoretical Physics, or ITP, was named for the [[Norwegians|Norwegian]]-[[United States|American]] [[physicist]] and [[businessman]] [[Fred Kavli]], in recognition of his donation of $7.5 million to the Institute.

Kohn Hall, which houses KITP, is located just beyond the Henley Gate at the East Entrance of the UCSB campus.  The building was designed by the architect [[Michael Graves]], and a new wing designed by Graves was added in 2003-2004.

'''Lewis Mumford''' (October 19, 1895&amp;nbsp;– January 26, 1990) was an American historian, [[Sociology|sociologist]], philosopher of technology, and [[Literary criticism|literary critic]]. Particularly noted for his study of cities and urban architecture, he had a broad career as a writer.  Mumford was influenced by the work of Scottish theorist Sir [[Patrick Geddes]] and worked closely with his associate the British sociologist [[Victor Branford]].

Mumford was also a contemporary and friend of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Clarence Stein]], [[Frederic Osborn]], [[Edmund Bacon (architect)|Edmund N. Bacon]], and [[Vannevar Bush]].

== Life ==

Mumford was born in [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], [[Queens]], New York and graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.odu.edu/ao/instadv/quest/cityascommunity.html |title=City As Community: The Life And Vision Of Lewis Mumford |first=Robert |last=Wojtowicz |journal=Quest |publisher=[[Old Dominion University]] |date=Jan 2001 |volume=4 |issue=1 |accessdate=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the [[City College of New York]] and [[The New School|The New School for Social Research]], but became ill with tuberculosis and never finished his degree. In 1918 he joined the navy to serve in World War I and was assigned as a radio electrician.&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/mumfordl|title=Mumford, Lewis|last=Sorensen|first=Lee (ed)|publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=Oct 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was discharged in 1919 and became associate editor of ''[[The Dial]]'', an influential [[modernist]] literary journal. He later worked for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' where he wrote architectural criticism and commentary on urban issues.

Mumford's earliest books in the field of literary criticism have had a lasting impact on contemporary American literary criticism. ''The Golden Day'' contributed to a resurgence in scholarly research on the work of 1850s American [[transcendentalist]] authors and ''Herman Melville: A Study of His Life and Vision'' effectively launched a revival in the study of the work of [[Herman Melville]]. Soon after, with the book ''The Brown Decades'', he began to establish himself as an authority in American architecture and urban life, which he interpreted in a social context.

In his early writings on urban life, Mumford was optimistic about human abilities and wrote that the human race would use electricity and [[mass communication]] to build a better world for all humankind. He would later take a more pessimistic stance. His early architectural criticism also helped to bring wider public recognition to the work of [[Henry Hobson Richardson]], [[Louis Sullivan]] and Frank Lloyd Wright.

In 1963, Mumford received the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for art criticism from the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/matherpast|title=Awards|publisher=The College Art Association|accessdate=Oct 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mumford received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="lmc-c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mumford.albany.edu/mumford/chronology_lm.htm|title=Chronology of Mumford's Life|publisher=Lewis Mumford Center|accessdate=Oct 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 Mumford was made an honorary [[British honours system|Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE).&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt; In 1976, he was awarded the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]].&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt; In 1986, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]].&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt;

He served as the architectural critic for ''The New Yorker'' magazine for over 30 years. His 1961 book, ''[[The City in History]]'', received the [[National Book Award]].&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nba1962/&gt;

Lewis Mumford died at the age of 94 at [[Lewis Mumford House|his home]] in [[Amenia (town), New York|Amenia, New York]] on January 26, 1990.&lt;ref name="lmc-c"/&gt; Nine years later it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

== Ideas ==

In his book ''The Condition of Man'', published in 1944, Mumford characterized his orientation toward the study of humanity as "organic humanism".  The term is an important one because it sets limits on human possibilities, limits that are aligned with the nature of the human body. Mumford never forgot the importance of air quality, of food availability, of the quality of water, or the comfort of spaces, because all these things had to be respected if people were to thrive. Technology and progress could never become a runaway train in his reasoning, so long as organic humanism was there to act as a brake. Indeed, Mumford considered the human brain from this perspective, characterizing it as hyperactive, a good thing in that it allowed humanity to conquer many of nature's threats, but potentially a bad thing if it were not occupied in ways that stimulated it meaningfully. Mumford's respect for human "nature", that is to say, the natural characteristics of being human, provided him with a platform from which to assess technologies, and technics in general. Thus his criticism and counsel with respect to the city and with respect to the implementation of technology was fundamentally organized around the organic humanism to which he ascribed. It was from the perspective of organic humanism that Mumford eventually launched a critical assessment of [[Marshall McLuhan]], who argued that the technology, not the natural environment, would ultimately shape the nature of humankind, a possibility that Mumford recognized, but only as a nightmare scenario.

Mumford believed that what defined humanity, what set human beings apart from other animals, was not primarily our use of tools (technology) but our use of language (symbols). He was convinced that the sharing of information and ideas amongst participants of primitive societies was completely natural to early humanity, and had obviously been the foundation of society as it became more sophisticated and complex.  He had hopes for a continuation of this process of information "pooling" in the world as humanity moved into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mumford | first = Lewis| title = Enough Energy for Life &amp; The Next Transformation of Man [MIT lecture transcript] | journal = CoEvolution Quarterly| volume = 1| issue = 4| pages = 19–23| publisher = POINT Foundation | location = Sausalito, CA | year = 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumford's choice of the word "technics" throughout his work was deliberate. For Mumford, technology is one part of technics. Using the broader definition of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[:wikt:τέχνη#Ancient Greek|tekhne]]'', which means not only technology but also art, skill, and dexterity, technics refers to the interplay of social milieu and technological innovation—the "wishes, habits, ideas, goals" as well as "industrial processes" of a society. As Mumford writes at the beginning of ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'', "other civilizations reached a high degree of technical proficiency without, apparently, being profoundly influenced by the methods and aims of technics."

===Megatechnics===
In ''[[The Myth of the Machine]] Vol II: The Pentagon of Power'' (Chapter 12) (1970), Mumford [[Critique of technology|criticizes the modern trend of technology]], which emphasizes constant, unrestricted expansion, production, and replacement. He contends that these goals work against technical perfection, durability, social efficiency, and overall human satisfaction. Modern technology, which he called "megatechnics", fails to produce lasting, quality products by using devices such as consumer [[credit (finance)|credit]], [[installment plan|installment buying]], non-functioning and defective designs, [[planned obsolescence]], and frequent [[planned obsolescence (business)|superficial "fashion" changes]]. "Without constant enticement by advertising," he writes, "production would slow down and level off to normal replacement demand. Otherwise many products could reach a plateau of efficient design which would call for only minimal changes from year to year."

He uses his own [[refrigerator]] as an example, reporting that it "has been in service for nineteen years, with only a single minor repair: an admirable job. Both automatic refrigerators for daily use and deepfreeze preservation are inventions of permanent value. ... [O]ne can hardly doubt that if biotechnic criteria were heeded, rather than those of market analysts and fashion experts, an equally good product might come forth from Detroit, with an equally long prospect of continued use."

===Biotechnics===
[[File:Mumford3.jpg|thumb|Pentagon of Power picture and a quote from it.]]
Mumford was deeply concerned with the relationship between technics and bioviability.  The latter term, not used by Mumford, characterizes an area's capability to support life up through its levels of complexity.  Before the advent of technology, most areas of the planet were bioviable at some level or other; however, where certain forms of technology advance rapidly, bioviability decreases dramatically.  Slag heaps, poisoned waters, parking lots, and concrete cities, for example, are extremely limited in terms of their bioviability, illustrated in the somewhat startling 1943 novel title ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'', and non-bioviable regions are common to cinema in the form of dystopias (e.g., ''Bladerunner''). Mumford did not believe it was necessary for bioviability to collapse as technics advanced, however, because he held it was possible to create technologies that functioned in an ecologically responsible manner, and he called that sort of technology biotechnics.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pentagon of Power'' p.395&lt;/ref&gt; Mumford believed that biotechnic consciousness (and possibly even community) was emerging as a later stage in the evolution of Darwinian thinking about the nature of human life. He believed this was the sort of technics needed to shake off the suicidal drive of "megatechnics." While Mumford recognized an ecological consciousness that traces back to the earliest communities, he regarded emerging biotechnics as a product of neo-Darwinian consciousness, as a post-industrial form of thinking, one that refuses to look away from the mutually-influencing relationship between the state of the living organism and the state of its environment. In Mumford's mind, the society organized around biotechnics would restrain its technology for the sake of that integral relationship.

In Mumford's understanding, the various technologies that arose in the megatechnic context have brought unintended and harmful side effects along with the obvious benefits they have bequeathed to us. He points out, for example, that the development of money (as a technology) created, as a side effect, a context for irrational accumulation of excess because it eliminated the burdensome aspects of object-wealth by making wealth abstract. In those eras when wealth was not abstract, plenitude had functioned as the organizing principle around its acquisition (i.e., wealth, measured in grains, lands, animals, to the point that one is satisfied, but not saddled with it). Money, which allows wealth to be conceived as pure quantity instead of quality, is an example of megatechnics, one which can spiral out of control. If Mumford is right in this conceptualization, historians and economists should be able to trace a relationship between the still-increasing abstraction of wealth and radical transformations with respect to wealth's distribution and role. And, indeed, it does appear that, alongside its many benefits, the movement toward electronic money has stimulated forms of economic stress and exploitation not yet fully understood and not yet come to their conclusion. A technology for distributing resources that was less given to abstract hoarding would be more suitable to a biotechnic conception of living.

Thus Mumford argued that the biotechnic society would not hold to the megatechnic delusion that technology must expand unceasingly, magnifying its own power and would shatter that delusion in order to create and preserve "livability." Rather than the megatechnic pursuit of power, the biotechnic society would pursue what Mumford calls "plenitude"; that is, a homeostatic relationship between resources and needs. This notion of plenitude becomes clearer if we suggest that the biotechnic society would relate to its technology in the manner an animal relates to available food–under circumstances of natural satisfaction, the pursuit of technological advance would not simply continue "for its own sake."

Alongside the limiting effect of satisfaction amidst plenitude, the pursuit of technological advance would also be limited by its potentially negative effects upon the organism. Thus, in a biotechnic society, the quality of air, the quality of food, the quality of water, these would all be significant concerns that could limit any technological ambitions threatening to them. The anticipated negative value of noise, radiation, smog, noxious chemicals, and other technical by-products would significantly constrain the introduction of new technical innovation. In Mumford's words, a biotechnic society would direct itself toward "qualitative richness, amplitude, spaciousness, and freedom from quantitative pressures and crowding. Self-regulation, self-correction, and self-propulsion are as much an integral property of organisms as nutrition, reproduction, growth, and repair." The biotechnic society would pursue balance, wholeness, and completeness; and this is what those individuals in pursuit of biotechnics would do as well.

Mumford's critique of the city and his vision of cities that are organized around the nature of human bodies, so essential to all Mumford's work on city life and urban design, is rooted in an incipient notion of biotechnics: "livability," a notion which Mumford got from his mentor, [[Patrick Geddes]].

Mumford used the term biotechnics in the later sections of ''The Pentagon of Power'', written in 1970. The term sits well alongside his early characterization of "organic humanism," in that biotechnics represent the concrete form of technique that appeals to an organic humanist. When Mumford described biotechnics, automotive and industrial pollution had become dominant technological concerns, along with the fear of nuclear annihilation. Mumford recognized, however, that technology had even earlier produced a plethora of hazards, and that it would do so into the future. For Mumford, human hazards are rooted in a power-oriented technology that does not adequately respect and accommodate the essential nature of humanity. Mumford is stating implicitly, as others would later state explicitly, that contemporary human life understood in its ecological sense is out of balance because the technical parts of its ecology (guns, bombs, cars, drugs) have spiraled out of control, driven by forces peculiar to them rather than constrained by the needs of the species that created them. He believed that biotechnics was the emerging answer and the only hope that could be set out against the problem of megatechnics.  It was an answer, he believed, that was already beginning to assert itself in his time.

It is true that Mumford's writing privileges the term "biotechnics" more than the "biotechnic society." The reason is clear in the last sentence of ''The Pentagon of Power'' where he writes, "for those of us who have thrown off the myth of the machine, the next move is ours: for the gates of the technocratic prison will open automatically, despite their rusty ancient hinges, as soon as we choose to walk out." Mumford believed that the biotechnic society was a desideratum—one that should guide his contemporaries as they walked out the doors of their megatechnic confines (he also calls them "coffins"). Thus he ends his narrative, as he well understood, at the beginning of another one: the possible revolution that gives rise to a biotechnic society, a quiet revolution, for Mumford, one that would arise from the biotechnic consciousness and actions of individuals. Mumford was an avid reader of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s philosophy of the organism.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., he published a critical review of [[Process and Reality]]: "Metaphysics and Art. Review of Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology, by Alfred North Whitehead; Essays in Philosophy, edited by Thomas Vernor Smith and William Kelley Wright; The Philosophic Way of Life, by T.V. Smith." ''The New Republic'', December 18, 1929: 117–118, reprinted in Alan Van Wyk and [[Michel Weber]] (eds.), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279954/Creativity_and_Its_Discontents._The_Response_to_Whiteheads_Process_and_Reality Creativity and Its Discontents. The Response to Whitehead's Process and Reality]'', Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, 2009, pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polytechnics versus monotechnics===
A key idea, introduced in ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'' (1934) was that technology was twofold:
* ''Polytechnic'', which enlists many different modes of technology, providing a complex framework to solve human problems.
* ''Monotechnic'', which is technology only for its own sake, which oppresses humanity as it moves along its own trajectory.

Mumford commonly criticized modern America's transportation networks as being "monotechnic" in their reliance on cars. [[Automobile]]s become obstacles for other modes of transportation, such as [[walking]], bicycle and [[public transit]], because the roads they use consume so much space and are such a danger to people. Mumford explains that the thousands of maimed and dead each year as a result of automobile accidents are a "ritual sacrifice" the American society makes because of its extreme reliance on highway transport.

===Three epochs of civilization===
Also discussed at length in ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'' is Mumford's division of human civilization into three distinct [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]]s (following concepts originated by Patrick Geddes):
:* ''Eotechnic'' (the [[middle ages]])
:* ''Paleotechnic'' (the time of the [[industrial revolution]]) and
:* ''Neotechnic'' (later, present-day)

===Megamachines===
Mumford also refers to large [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] organizations as ''megamachines''—a machine using humans as its components. These organizations characterize Mumford's [[stage theory]] of civilization. The most recent megamachine manifests itself, according to Mumford, in modern [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocratic]] [[nuclear powers]]—Mumford used the examples of the Soviet and United States power complexes represented by the [[Kremlin]] and [[the Pentagon]], respectively. The builders of the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], the [[Roman Empire]] and the armies of the [[World War]]s are prior examples.

He explains that meticulous attention to accounting and standardization, and elevation of military leaders to divine status, are spontaneous features of megamachines throughout history. He cites such examples as the repetitive nature of Egyptian paintings which feature enlarged [[pharaoh]]s and public display of enlarged portraits of Communist leaders such as [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]. He also cites the overwhelming prevalence of quantitative accounting records among surviving historical fragments, from [[ancient Egypt]] to [[Nazi Germany]].

Necessary to the construction of these megamachines is an enormous [[bureaucracy]] of humans which act as "servo-units", working without ethical involvement. According to Mumford, technological improvements such as the [[assembly line]], or instant, global, [[wireless]], communication and [[remote control]], can easily weaken the perennial psychological barriers to certain types of questionable actions. An example which he uses is that of [[Adolf Eichmann]], the Nazi official who organized logistics in support of [[the Holocaust]]. Mumford collectively refers to people willing to carry out placidly the extreme goals of these megamachines as "Eichmanns".

===The clock as herald of the Industrial Revolution===

One of the better-known studies of Mumford is of the way the [[Clock#Early mechanical clocks|mechanical clock]] was developed by monks in the [[Middle Ages]] and subsequently adopted by the rest of society. He viewed this device as the key invention of the whole [[Industrial Revolution]], contrary to the common view of the [[steam engine]] holding the prime position, writing: "The clock, not the steam-engine, is the key-machine of the modern industrial age. ... The clock ... is a piece of power-machinery whose 'product' is seconds and minutes ...."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, Lewis. ''Technics and Civilization''. London: Routledge, 1934. pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban civilization===
''[[The City in History]]'' won the 1962 U.S. [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]].&lt;ref name=nba1962&gt;[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1962 "National Book Awards – 1962"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In this influential book Mumford explored the development of urban civilizations. Harshly critical of [[urban sprawl]], Mumford argues that the structure of modern cities is partially responsible for many social problems seen in western society. While [[pessimist]]ic in tone, Mumford argues that [[urban planning]] should emphasize an organic relationship between people and their living spaces.

Mumford uses the example of the medieval city as the basis for the "ideal city," and claims that the modern city is too close to the Roman city (the sprawling megalopolis) which ended in collapse; if the modern city carries on in the same vein, Mumford argues, then it will meet the same fate as the Roman city.

Mumford wrote critically of [[urban culture]] believing the city is "a product of earth ... a fact of nature ... man's method of expression."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, ''The Culture of Cities,'' 1938&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Mumford recognized the crises facing urban culture, distrustful of the growing finance industry, political structures, fearful that a local community culture was not being fostered by these institutions. Mumford feared "metropolitan finance," urbanisation, politics, and [[Social alienation|alienation]]. Mumford wrote: "The physical design of cities and their economic functions are secondary to their relationship to the natural environment and to the spiritual values of human community."&lt;ref&gt;City Reader
 edited by Richard T. LeGates, Frederic Stout, p.91&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suburbs====
Suburbia did not escape Mumford's criticism either:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the suburb one might live and die without marring the image of an innocent world, except when some shadow of evil fell over a column in the newspaper. Thus the suburb served as an asylum for the preservation of illusion. Here domesticity could prosper, oblivious of the pervasive regimentation beyond. This was not merely a child-centered environment; it was based on a childish view of the world, in which reality was sacrificed to the pleasure principle.&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, Lewis.  ''The City in History: Its Origins, Its Transformations, and Its Prospects'' (New York, 1961), p.464; quoted in {{cite crabgrass}}, pp.155–156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Religion and Spirituality ===
Mumford is also among the first urban planning scholars who paid serious attention to religion in the planning field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manouchehrifar|first=Babak|date=2018-11-08|title=Is Planning 'Secular'?

&lt;blockquote&gt;The segregation of the spiritual life from the practical life is a curse that falls impartially upon both sides of our existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/246342365|title=Faith for living|last=1895-1990.|first=Mumford, Lewis,|date=1940|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|oclc=246342365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Influence ==

Mumford's interest in the history of technology and his explanation of  "polytechnics", along with his general philosophical bent, has been an important influence on a number of more recent thinkers concerned that technology serve human beings as broadly and well as possible. Some of these authors—such as [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Witold Rybczynski]], [[Richard Gregg (social philosopher)|Richard Gregg]],&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Richard. ''The Value of Voluntary Simplicity''. Pendle Hill, 1936, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amory Lovins]], [[J. Baldwin]], [[E. F. Schumacher]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Erich Fromm]], [[Murray Bookchin]], [[Thomas Merton]], [[Marshall McLuhan]], and [[Colin Ward]]&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Colin. ''Influences: Voices of Creative Dissent''. Green Books, 1991, pp. 106–07.&lt;/ref&gt;—have been intellectuals and persons directly involved with technological development and decisions about the use of technology.

Mumford also had an influence on the American environmental movement, with thinkers like [[Barry Commoner]] and Bookchin being influenced by his ideas on cities, ecology and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, Derek. ''Green History'', Routledge, 1994, pg. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ramachandra Guha]] noted his work contains "some of the earliest and finest thinking on [[bioregionalism]], anti-nuclearism, [[biodiversity]], alternate energy paths, ecological urban planning and appropriate technology."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Guha, Ramachandra &amp; Martinez-Alier, J. (1997) ''Varieties of Environmentalism: Essays North and South''. London: Earthscan (1997). For other works on Mumford's ecological and environmental thought, see: David Pepper ''Modern Environmentalism'', Routledge, 1996; Max Nicolson, ''The New Environmental Age'', Cambridge University Press, 1989; and BA Minteer, ''The Landscape of Reform: Civic Pragmatism and Environmental Thought in America'' MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumford's influence is also evident in the work of some artists including [[Berenice Abbott]]'s photographs of New York City in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Barr, Peter. "Becoming Documentary: Berenice Abbott's Photographs, 1925–1939," PhD dissertation, Boston University, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumford was an inspiration for [[Ellsworth Toohey]], the antagonist in [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' (1943).&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Walter (1998). "[http://reason.com/archives/1998/02/01/the-writerly-rand The Writerly Rand]", Reason.com, October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research''' (abbreviation: '''MPS'''; {{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für Sonnensystemforschung}}) is a [[research institute]] in [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]] located in [[Göttingen]], [[Germany]], where it relocated in February 2014 from the nearby village of [[Lindau (Katlenburg-Lindau)|Lindau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mps.mpg.de/66046/neubau 'Neubau'] (in German) on institute website, viewed 2014-07-09&lt;/ref&gt; The exploration of the [[solar system]] is the central theme for research done at this institute.

[[File:MPI Sonnensystemforschung Goettingen.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|New Institute building in Göttingen, built in 2013 and occupied in 2014.]]

MPS is a part of the [[Max Planck Society]], which operates 80 research facilities in [[Germany]].

Over the last five years{{when|date=July 2014}}, members of the Institute have each year published about 270 articles in international journals and books and given 360 conference presentations.

== Research ==
MPS is organised in three departments: 
* [http://www.mps.mpg.de/solar-physics Sun and Heliosphere]
* [http://www.mps.mpg.de/planetary-science Planets and Comets]
* [http://www.mps.mpg.de/helioseismology-asteroseismology Solar and Stellar Interiors]
In addition, since 2002 there is also an [[Max Planck Society#International Max Planck Research Schools|International Max Planck Research School]].
Subjects of research at the Institute are the various objects within the solar system. A major area of study concerns the Sun, its atmosphere, the interplanetary medium as influenced by the solar wind, as well as the impact of solar particles and radiation on the planets. The second area of research involves the interiors, surfaces, atmospheres, ionospheres, and magnetospheres of the planets and their moons, as well as of comets and asteroids.
A further essential part of the activities at the Institute is the development and construction of instruments for space missions. 
The analysis and interpretation of the acquired datasets are accompanied by intensive theoretical work. Physical models are proposed and then tested and further developed with the aid of computer simulations.

=== The Sun and Heliosphere ===
The researchers at the MPS are studying the complete range of dynamic and often spectacular processes occurring on the Sun – from the interior to the outer heliosphere. At the heart of this research is the [[Magnetosphere|magnetic field]], which plays a decisive role in these processes. It is generated by gas currents in the interior of the [[Sun]] and causes, among other things, dark spots on the surface. Answers to the following questions are being sought: Why does the magnetic field change with an eleven-year cycle? How does the magnetic field produce the various structures on the Sun? How is the corona heated to many millions of degrees?
Instruments developed by MPS aboard the space- craft [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] and [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] have provided fundamentally new insights: Measurements of the ultraviolet spectrometer [[SUMER]] on board [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] played a decisive role in recognising the significance of the magnetic field for dynamic processes and [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] measured the three-dimensional structure of the solar wind for the first time.
Another important research topic at "The Sun and Heliosphere" department is the influence on the Earth due to the Sun’s variable activity. Scientists are working intensively on the project [[STEREO]], in which two identical spacecraft trace disturbances from the Sun to the Earth from different observational points, permitting predictions of potentially dangerous events.
The physical processes involved in the origin and development of magnetic fields on the Sun take place on very small scales and therefore require measurements with very high spatial resolution. The balloon-borne telescope [[Sunrise (telescope)|Sunrise]], built under Institute leadership and flown in June 2009, was able to make out structures on the Sun’s surface as small as 100&amp;nbsp;kilometers.
Future projects will stress research into the physical causes of the Sun’s variations. The ambitious [[Solar Orbiter]] Mission, based on a suggestion from the Institute, will see a probe approach our star to within a fifth of the Earth-Sun distance in order to investigate the magnetic field and its effects in the various layers of the solar atmosphere.

=== Planets and Comets ===
The Institute develops scientific instruments that fly with spacecraft to other planets. Highly specialized cameras have investigated the [[Saturn]] moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], analyse the surface of [[Mars]], and probe the clouds and winds of [[Venus]]. Microwave instruments determine the composition of atmospheres while infrared spectrometers examine surface rocks. A novel laser altimeter on board [[BepiColumbo]] will survey the topography of [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] to within a meter. Further MPS instruments identify the atoms, electrons, and dust that move around the planets and impact their moons. Here the influence of the [[solar wind]] on the atmospheric gases is of particular interest.
Theoretical studies and intensive computer simulations help to understand the processes both inside and surrounding the planets and to interpret the measured data. Models developed at MPS can describe, for example, interactions with the solar wind, the atmospheric dynamics, or the generation of the terrestrial magnetic field by means of currents deep in the iron core of our planet.
In addition, the Institute has along tradition in cometary research. A major highlight was the camera developed at the Institute for the [[ESA]] spacecraft [[Giotto]] which delivered the first photographs ever of a comet’s nucleus in 1986. A particular challenge was the development of numerous scientific instruments for the [[ESA]] Mission [[Rosetta]], such as cameras, chemical analyzers, and essential components for the landing module Philae. Rosetta was launched in 2004, and matched orbits with the comet [[Churyumov-Gerasimenko]] in 2014; a few months later, Philae landed on the comet’s surface.
The Institute has also provided the cameras for the [[NASA]] [[Dawn Mission]], launched in 2007, to study two of the largest asteroids, Ceres and Vesta.

=== Helio- and Asteroseismology ===
The MPS is hosting the German Data Centre for the NASA’s [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (SDO), which has provided improved data on small scales of space and time to study the connections between the solar interior and magnetic activity in the solar atmosphere.
A particularly exciting research activity at the MPS is the study of seismic waves in the vicinity of sunspots. The goal is to probe the subsurface structure of sunspots in three dimensions. [[Sunspot]] [[helioseismology]] is a challenging science as it requires modelling of the propagation of waves through magnetic structures; this can only be achieved by numerical simulations.

== Scientific Projects ==
The institute has been lead/involved in several international scientific projects such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mps.mpg.de/solar-system-research | title =MPS Projects and Research Teams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar Orbiter]], [[Solar Dynamics Observatory|SDO]], [[Sunrise (telescope)|Sunrise]], [[STEREO]], [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]], [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]], [[BepiColombo]], [[Exomars]], [[Chandrayaan-2|Chandrayaan]], [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]], [[Herschel Space Observatory|Herschel]], [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]], [[Venus Express]], [[SMART-1]], [[SOFIA]], [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]], [[Mars Express]], [[Mars DFG]], [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]], [[Cluster (spacecraft)|Cluster]], [[Helios (spacecraft)|Helios]], [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]] and [[Giotto (spacecraft)|Giotto]].

These contributions consist developing of the instruments and/or scientific research activities.

== Degree programme ==

The MPI for Solar System Research offers the [[PhD]] programme "International Max-Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Solar System Science" together with the [[University of Göttingen]]. The Solar System School offers a three-year course of study emphasizing actual research. The curriculum covers the entire area of the solar system from small bodies to the planets and the Sun. The goal is a broad, interdisciplinary, and solid scientific education, extended with courses in numerical physics, space technology, project management, scientific writing, and presentation techniques. There are always about 50 graduate students studying at the Solar System School. Two thirds are from abroad from over 30 different countries. About 30 percent are women.

== History ==
[[File:Max-Planck-Institute-Solarsystem-Research.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research - April 2006]]
The institute was founded by [[Walter Dieminger]], who was head of the [[Luftwaffe]] test center at [[Rechlin-Lärz Airfield|Rechlin]] at the [[Müritz]] from 1934 onwards. [[Erich Regener]] was cofounder. After being renamed to the "Centre for Radio Transmission" in 1943 and moving to [[Leobersdorf]] in 1944, the institute was united with the [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer institute]] from [[Freiburg]] at Ried in the Innkreis. After the war an Allied commission decided to move the institute to [[Lindau (Katlenburg-Lindau)|Lindau am Harz]], where buildings of the [[University of Hanover|Technical University of Hanover]] already existed. The convoy arrived on the 2nd and 3 March 1946. During 1948 the radio institute of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute|Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] was transferred from the [[Fraunhofer Society]] to the [[Max Planck Society]] and renamed "Institute for Ionosphere Research" in 1949. In 1950 the US Air Force paid for the construction of an ionospheric echolot system. The full transfer from Fraunhofer to Max Planck Society and the appointment of W. Dieminger as Director followed by the transfer of the Max Planck Institute of Stratosphere Research from Weisenau near Ravensburg to Lindau and another renaming to "Max Planck Institute for Aeronomy" completed the built up.

[[File:Max-Planck-Institute-Solarsystem-Research-2013-Winter.jpg|thumb|300px|Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Lindau, about a year before relocating - March 2013.]]

Erhard Keppler became the science lead in the first German satellite [[Azur (satellite)|Azur]] (in cooperation with NASA) and with him a small group of scientists dedicated to work with satellites was established in Lindau. The institute was selected to build part of the instrumentation of the satellite which was launched in November 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Deutschlands Aufbruch ins All | url = http://www.mpg.de/bilderBerichteDokumente/multimedial/mpForschung/2009/heft04/pdf37.pdf | accessdate = 2010-03-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instruments of the [[Helios probes]] another German NASA cooperation were also built by the institute.

After the retirement of W. Dieminger in 1974 the focus changed from atmospheric research to space research. The Institute participated in a long series of space missions like [[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo]], [[Ulysses probe|Ulysses]], [[Cluster mission|Cluster]], [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]], [[Cassini-Huygens]], [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta]], [[Mars Express]] [[Venus Express]] and was responsible for most of the camera system of the [[Giotto mission]] to [[Comet Halley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The institute was leading organization in the development, construction and scientific analysis of the [[sunrise (telescope)]]. The telescope is [[solar telescope]] in the [[ultraviolet]], that hangs from a [[high-altitude balloon]]. The five-day maiden flight was conducted in June 2009.

The biggest changes to the Institute resulted from German unification with the retraction of two of the four directors of the institute in 1998 and 2004 after the retirement of Hagfors and Rosenbauer. The institute was renamed "Max Planck Institute of Solar System Research" in 2004 after the last director concerned with [[Ionosphere]] and [[Stratosphere]] research retired. The two remaining groups, of director [[Sami Solanki|S. Solanki]] dedicated to the [[sun]] and [[heliosphere]] and of U. Christensen dedicated to [[planet]]s and [[comet]]s form the present-day Institute.

Since 2004, the institute has published the open access review journal [[Living Reviews in Solar Physics]].

The Max Planck Society decided to move the institute closer to the [[University of Göttingen]]. In 2010, it was planned to relocate it to a new building next to the University's Faculty of Physics by April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hna.de/nachrichten/landkreis-goettingen/goettingen/millionen-neubau-760543.html | title =Sonnensystem-Forscher ziehen nach Göttingen }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was completed in February 2014 and the opening ceremony held on 21 May of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research - New building|url=http://www.mps.mpg.de/institute/new-building}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut''' is situated at the heart of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in the State of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. [[Naumburg Cathedral]] and the landscpae has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the [[World Heritage List|List of World Heritage]]. On July 1, 2018, only Naumburg Cathedral was listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]].&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-naumburg-cathedral-wins-world-heritage-designation/a-44481701|title=Germany's Naumburg Cathedral wins World Heritage designation|work=[[DW-TV|DW]]|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landscape arount the World Heritage nomination "Naumburg Cathedral" is representative for processes at the [[High Middle Ages]] that shaped the whole continent: [[Christianization]], settlement and [[Cultivation (agriculture)|cultivation]] processes, the so-called [[Landesausbau]], that took place between 1000 and 1300. This borderland region also bears witness of the intercultural exchange of different cultures in the [[High Middle Ages]]. The highest-ranking buildings and works of art, most of all Naumburg Cathedral with its globally unique artistic and iconographic founder figures, provides testimony to the claims to power and the self-confidence of the worldly and spiritual rulers as well as to the region’s crucial role as a place of interchange between Western and Eastern realms.

== Nomination as World Heritage ==
[[File:Steinmeister vineyard.jpg|thumb|Steinmeister vineyard]]
In 1998, Naumburg Cathedral was inscribed into the Tentative List for World Heritage nominations and extended seven years later by its surrounding cultural [[landscape]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Tentative Lists are prepared by States Parties to the Convention on the Protection of Cultural and Natural World Heritage. They contain a number of nominiation proposals to be submitted in the future. For further information on the selection of potential World Heritage sites, please see [http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/ selection criteria].&lt;/ref&gt; ″The ′Naumburg Cathedral and the surrounding cultural landscape along the rivers [[Saale]] and [[Unstrut]]′ are outstanding and representative examples of the High Middle Ages (1000-1300). Nowhere else in the world has such a high density of monuments and cultural landscape elements from the High Middle Ages been preserved in such a small space in such a level of authenticity in its original spatial setting.″.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Dr. Jeffrey Hamburger, Harvard University, Prof. Dr. Dany Sandron, Université de Paris-Sorbonne,  Prof. Dr. Stefan Tebruck, Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen a.o.(2017).{{cite book|title=The outstanding significance of the Naumburg Cathedral and the cultural landscape on the rivers Saale and Unstrut.|publisher= Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut|pages=1–2|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The nomination was discussed on the 39th meeting of [[World Heritage Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2015): WHC-15/39.COM/INF.19.{{cite book|title=Summary Records of the 39th session of the World Heritage Committee (Bonn, 2015).|publisher= UNESCO press|pages=206–207|url=http://whc.unesco.org/fr/sessions/39COM/documents/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Heritage Committee decided to defer the nomination in order to allow for a revision and renewed submission taking into account the recommendations of the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|ICOMOS]]-evaluation and seeking the guidance and advice by ICOMOS in the process.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2015): WHC-15/39.COM/19.{{cite book|title=Decisions adopted at the 39th session of the World Heritage Committee (Bonn, 2015).|publisher= UNESCO press|pages=206–207|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/39COM/documents/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On 1 February 2016, Germany submitted a renewed submission to the [[World Heritage Centre]] in [[Paris]], [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1.{{cite book|title=Nominations to the World Heritage List (Krakow, 2017).|publisher= UNESCO press|page=54|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nomination was discussed at the 41st meeting of the World Heritage Committee in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], from 2 until 12 July 2017 where the Committee decided upon the Outstanding Universal Value of the Naumburg Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=41st session of the World Heritage Committee in Krakow|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany submitted the revised nomination "Naumburg Cathedral" on  1 February 2018. However, only [[Naumburg Cathedral]] was listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] on July 1, 2018. The German officials were indifferent about the decision of excluding the surrounding landscape.&lt;ref name="DW"/&gt;

=== Cultural landscape ===
The cultural landscape around the Naumburg Cathedral  is a [[cultural landscape]] that illustrates the "evolution of human society and settlement over time".&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2016): WHC.16/01. {{cite book|title=Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention.|page=11|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This landscape was created intentionally by man.&lt;ref name="Rössler2"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=World Heritage Centre|title=Cultural landscapes: The challenges of conservation|chapter-url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/publications|last=Rössler|first=Mechtild|chapter=Linking Nature and Culture: World Heritage Cultural Landscapes.|year=2002|publisher=UNESCO press|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut displays the rise of the [[Central Middle Ages]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="Le Goff"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Haverkamp|editor-first=Alfred|editor2-last=Schieder|editor2-first=Wolfgang|title=Aufbruch und Gestaltung, Deutschland 1056-1273, Volume 1.|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz3bPMw_7h4C&amp;pg=PA407|last=Le Goff|first=Jacques|chapter=The High Middle Ages.|year=1992|publisher=C.H. Beck|isbn=3406302653|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a time of rise, a ″take off″ due to an [[Population growth|increase in population]], [[Christianization]] and major transformation in [[agriculture]].&lt;ref name="″Newmann"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Classen|editor-first=Albrecht|title=Handbook of Medieval Studies: Terms –Methods-Trends.|last=Newmann|first=Jonathan M.|chapter=Narratology and Literary Theory in Medieval Studies.|year=1992|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=3110267306|page=982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ″Landesausbau″, [[Urban planning|urban development]], internal [[colonization]] and territorialisation, took place all across [[Europe]]. ″Never again has Europe seen such cultural and institutional uniformity as at that time″.&lt;ref name="″Simms"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Smyth|editor-first=William J.|editor2-last=Wehlan|editor2-first=Kevin|title=Common Ground: Essays on the Historical Geography of Ireland presented to T.

The nominated area serves as an extraordinary model region due to the density and quality of elements displaying mediaeval land development and land exploitation. It was a melting pot of populations of different origins, [[Franks|Frankish]], [[Thuringian]], [[Saxon]], [[Flemish]], and [[Slavs|Slavonic]]. Furthermore, as a sensitive border region, it was shaped by [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] and secular powers seeking the rights of possession, representation and defense. &lt;br /&gt;
In the nominated landscape, 720 elements from the period of the [[Central Middle Ages]] are still in use, establish the [[Identity (social science)|identity]] of the region and give testimony of the shaping of border lands during a period of no more than 200 years in the [[High Middle Ages]], which has in this instance been tangibly preserved to present day.&lt;ref name="″Denyer"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Taylor|editor-first=Ken|editor2-last=Clair|editor2-first=Archer S.|editor3-last=Mitchell|editor3-first=Nora J.|title=Conserving Cultural Landscapes: Challenges and New Directions.|last=Newmann|first=Jonathan M.|chapter=Sustaining the Outstanding Universal Value of World Heritage Cultural Landscapes.|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415744058|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of the cultural landscape ==
The [[landscape]] is characterized by authentic [[monument]]s, intact [[urban morphology]] and unchanged rural landscape from the [[High Middle Ages]] visible in Naumburg and Freyburg, around the villages of Ebersroda, Schleberoda, Gross-Wilsdorf and Flemmingen, as well as the vineyards of Dechantenberg, Schweigenberg, Köppelberg, and Saalhäuser. In total, four castles and four [[Monastery|monastic complexes]], two cities as well as villages, vineyards, fertile fields and pastures constitute this nomination.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1.{{cite book|title=Nominations to the World Heritage List (Krakow, 2017).|publisher= UNESCO press|page=54|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They form a serial nomination with a total of 11 components parts : [[File:Lanscape around Neuenburg.jpg|thumb|Landscape around Neuenburg]]

=== Component: Naumburg ===
==== Naumburg Cathedral ====
Naumburg Cathedral is known for its [[architecture]], [[sculpture]]s and images: ″The harmonic connection between architecture, sculpture and stained glass windows in the west choir of the cathedral counts among the most impressive creations of human creativity in the Middle Ages at large.″&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Dr. Jeffrey Hamburger, Harvard University, Prof. Dr. Dany Sandron, Université de Paris-Sorbonne,  Prof. Dr. Stefan Tebruck, Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen a.o.(2017).{{cite book|title=The outstanding significance of the Naumburg Cathedral and the cultural landscape on the rivers Saale and Unstrut.|publisher= Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut|pages=1–2|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] core structure is flanked by two [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[Rood screen|choirs]] in the east and in the west, built in the transitional style between [[Romanesque architecture|Late Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Early Gothic]].&lt;ref name="″Wixom"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin v. 46, no. 3|title=Medieval Sculpture at the Cloisters.|last=Wixom|first=William D.|chapter=Medieval Sculpture.|year=1988|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== The Naumburg Masters =====
[[File:Naumburg Masters.jpg|thumb|Naumburg Masters]]
The worldwide known workshop of [[Sculpture|sculptors]] and [[Stonemasonry|stonemasons]], which was likely established in the early [[13th century]], known as the [[Naumburg Master]]s, was headed by a sculptor-architect, who has been described by scholars as ″an artist of real genius″.&lt;ref name="Janson"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Janson|editor-first=Horst W.|editor2-last=Janson|editor2-first=Anthony F.|title=History of Art: The Western Tradition.|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415929356|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the work of the Naumburg Masters, marked by an extraordinary realism and individualism of sculptures and a detailed representation of the environment such as plants or ornaments, has justified Naumburg’s reputation beyond its region.

===== Choir screens – Passion of Christ =====
[[File:West choir.jpg|thumb|West choir]]
One feature of the Naumburg Cathedral is its two almost completely preserved [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] screen structures from the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Reeve"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeve|first=Matthew M.|title=Reading Gothic Architecture|date=2008|publisher=l'Université du Michigan|isbn=9782503525365|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the east choir, the only late [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] hall choir screen has survived. In the west choir, there is a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] partition-type screen: ″Even within the tiny corpus of medieval churches whose original configurations of architecture and sculpture remain intact, the arrangement at Naumburg is unique.″&lt;ref name="Jung"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Jacqueline E.|title=The gothic screen.

The conceptually sophisticated arrangement of the [[Passion of Jesus|passion of Christ]] is one of the most outstanding among the preserved sculptural ensembles from the 13th century, providing i.a. detailed information on contemporary clothing.

===== Glass painting =====
[[File:West choir Naumburg.jpg|thumb|West choir Naumburg]]
The window paintings of the west choir were created from an unknown glass painting workshop in close consultation with the building workshop of the [[Naumburg Master]], together creating unity and harmony. This becomes evident by the designs of the images of the saints that correspond with the founders’ sculptures in many aspects like positions, gestures and weapons. The portrayal of ten [[Bishopric of Naumburg-Zeitz|bishops of Naumburg]] at the bottom of the window rows creates the impression as if the statues of the founders were standing on the same level as the medals. The glass paintings count among the most significant glass paintings of their style from the [[13th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Der Naumburger Dom St. Peter and Paul - Ein Kleinod der europäischen Kulturgeschichte.

===== Old Town of Naumburg =====
[[File:Old city of Naumburg.jpg|thumb|Old city of Naumburg]]
Naumburg was a [[Episcopal see|bishop’s seat]] and an important [[Market (place)|market place]] founded at the beginning of the [[11th century]] on the place of the former [[Slavs|Slav]] fortress of [[Wethau]]. The development of the town is closely connected with one of the most powerful and noble Ekkehardine dynasty of that time, [[Emperor Conrad II]] and [[Bishop of Zeitz|Bishop Hildeward of Zeitz]]. 
With the consent of the [[pope John XIX]] and the [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Konrad II]], as well as citing the danger of Slav incursions, [[margrave]] Ekkerhard I relocated the [[Episcopal see|Episcopal See]] of Zeitz to Naumburg. Along with the bishop’s seat he transferred his own family seat from Kleinjena to their own estate at the new castle ″Nuwemburch″ in Naumburg around 1028. Furthermore, he assigned the protection of the See to the ″new castle″, an event hitherto unparalleled in the history of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vereinigte-domstifter.de/en/foundation/the-combined-cathedral-chapters/domstift-naumburg|title=

[[File:Certificate Naumburg.jpg|thumb|left|Certificate Naumburg]]
In 1033, another highly unusual event for this time took place: On the initiative of the bishop Kadeloh of Memleben, Emperor Conrad II granted the merchants of Kleinjena, who moved to Naumburg free trade and the heritable, interest-free ownership of their enclosed domicile.&lt;ref name="Reuter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reuter|first=Timothy|title=Germany in the Early Middle Ages c.800 – 1056 (Longman History of Germany)|date= 2013|publisher=Lucent Books|isbn=9780582081567|pages=42–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the earliest dated written document from 13 July 1033, that marked the Nuvemburg to the powerful market and merchant settlement in Naumburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Urkundenbuch des Hochstifts Naumburg: Teil 1 (967-1207)|trans-title=The book of documents of the Bishopric Naumburg: Part1 |page=26|author=Rosenfeld, Felix|publisher=Magdeburg|date=1925|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Margraves Ekkehard II and Hermann also established two monasteries, the [[Benedictine monastery|Benedictine Monastery]] of St. George and the St Moritz Monastery. When the Ekkehardine dynasty died out by 1046, the bishops became the rulers of the town. By that time, Naumburg had already developed into a political, economic and religious center for the entirety of this border region. The trade routes in the region were relocated to Naumburg, which was strategically situated at the crossing of the [[Via Regia]] and the Regensburg Road.&lt;ref name="Jeep3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeep|first=John M.|title=Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia|date=October 2001|publisher=Garland|isbn=9781135575069|page=558}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nowadays, the roads as well as parcel structures reflect the structure of the medieval civil town. The earliest stone buildings in Naumburg are situated in the cathedral precincts with the oldest residential tower of Naumburg with two Romanesque floors constructed probably in the mid-12th century at the cathedral precincts.

=== Component: Freyburg ===
[[File:Church of Freyburg.jpg|thumb|Church of Freyburg]]
The old town of Freyburg is situated 9 kilometers north of Naumburg on the left bank of the Unstrut River. This component contains Neuenburg Castle above the river valley.

==== Neuenburg Castle ====
[[File:Neuenburg Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|Neuenburg Chapel]]
Around 1090, it was most probably [[Louis the Springer]]  who built the vast and impressive complex of Neuenburg Castle. Situated in the border region, this fortified castle served military purposes and reflected ambitions, self-confidence and sophistication of the [[Ludovingians|Ludowingians]]. Already in 1100, Neuenburg Castle was the largest and most important fortification in central Germany and remained of outstanding political and military significance until the [[13th century]]. It was designed as a border castle for the powerful Ludowinger dynasty and was part of a network of the landgraves’ castles, which also included [[Wartburg Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die romanische Neuenburg bei Freyburg (Unstrut) und ihre Stellung im hochmittelalterlichen Burgenbau.

[[File:Neuenburg Castle.jpg|thumb|Neuenburg at night]]
Built around 1090, Neuenburg Castle was extended and modernized on a large scale several times. With its 30 000 square meters, the [[castle]] was amongst the strongest architectural representations of military power in all of the empire. It has survived to a remarkable extend: Major sections of the curtain walls in the north and east, part of the gate, the bottom part of the cattle, the castle keep, trenches in the east and in the south are conserved until today. The [[landmark]] big William (Dicker Wilhelm) is situated in the north-eastern part of the complex and visible from far away as a symbol of power. The castle keep III is classified as an independent development next to the French residential towers (donjons) which produced similar examples in the [[Rhineland]] region. Around 1225, a residential tower (residential tower II) was built probably for the landgrave’s family outside the southern curtain wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Schloß Neuenburg bei Freyburg/Unstrut.

[[File:Residence building at Neuenburg.jpg|thumb|Residence building at Neuenburg]]
The court culture of the [[Count palatine|Count Palatine]] at Neuenburg Castle was an extremely important center of literary activities in the Empire at the end of the [[12th century in Germany|12th]] and beginning of the [[13th century]]. The most important poets of the 13th century, namely [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]  and [[Walther von der Vogelweide]]  stayed at Neuenburg Castle. Heinrich von Weldecke completed here the [[Eneas]] novel which was the foundation of the [[German language]] secular epic. ″When Veldeke was called to the court of Thuringia [..], he joined the entourage of a great patron and became the esteemed center of the most important literary circle that existed in Germany at the time″.&lt;ref name="Bunke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunke|first=Joachim|title=Courtly Culture: Literature and Society in the High Middle Ages|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520066342|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==== Old town of Freyburg ====
[[File:Neuenburg view from Freyburg.jpg|thumb|Neuenburg view from Freyburg]]
In the last quarter of the 12th, [[Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia|Herman I]] from the [[Ludowinger]] dynasty founded the town of Freyburg. The town was built at the food of Neuenburg Castle around a rectangular market place to meet the demands of the increased population, to provide the Neuenburg Castle with merchandise and to secure the passage and revenues of the [[Unstrut|Unstrut River]]. The [[Landgrave of Thuringia|landgraves of Thuringia]] controlled the road in the valley by erecting this fortified town. The determinative ″frey″ (free) referred to the royal freedom granted to it when it was founded and to the baronial privilege of a nearly royal rank, which primarily reveals the self-image of its rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Freyburg an der Unstrut – Ein Beispiel landesherrlicher Städtepolitik.

The landgraves were not directly present in the town but resided in Neuenburg Castle. [[Louis IV, Landgrave of Thuringia|Landgrove Ludwig IV]] and his wife, the later Saint [[Elizabeth of Hungary]], built the town parish church of St Mary’s to emphasize the baronial need for representation.&lt;ref name="Heinemeyer"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Brekle|editor-first=Herbert E.|editor2-last=Dobnig-Jiilich|editor2-first=Edeltraud a.o.|title=New German Biography (NDB)|last=Barrera|first=Magdalena|chapter=Ludwig IV the Saint, Landgrave of Thuringia and Count Palatine of Saxony. |year=1987|publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot|isbn= 3428001826|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital ornamentation in the entrance area with its diamond-shaped net and the Romanesque sculpting of the compact [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] is of outstanding quality in the way of the curves of the bodies and the graphic lines of the figures were sculptured. 
Freyburg’s regular layout is a grid of roads crossing each other in right angles, a distinct transverse axis and its nearly exact subdivision in blocks. After the extinction of the [[Ludovingians|Ludowinger dynasty]] in 1247, the city lost its significance but continued its [[viticulture]] for which it is still known in the [[Saale-Unstrut|Saale-Unstrut region]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beziehungen zwischen Kulturlandschaften und Tourismus.

==== Zscheiplitz Monastery ====
[[File:Church in Zscheiplitz.jpg|thumb|Church in Zscheiplitz]]
The [[Benedictine]] convent of nuns, the Zscheiplitz Monastery, was first mentioned in 1203 and is situated two kilometers west of Freyburg. The name of Zscheiplitz has its roots in the Slavic name ″ciplic″ (small). Around 1085, after the murder of [[Friedrich III, Landgraf of Thuringia|landgrave Friedrich III]], his widow Adelheid donated the estate of Zscheiplitz to the church. It was then turned into a Benedictine monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Zscheiplitz. Sühnekirche, Kloster, Rittergut, Dorfkirche, Weingut.

==== Vineyard of Schweigenberg ====
The [[vineyard]] of Schweigenberg is located west of Freyburg and was probably created by citizens of Freyburg upon the initiative of the [[List of rulers of Thuringia|landgraves of Thuringia]] and / or the monasteries of Goseck and Zscheiplitz in the 13th century. It benefitted from favorable climatic conditions and agrarian innovations for a diversified subsistence economy in the region. This vineyard is still recognized in Germany as a prime example of [[Wine-growing in Germany|terraced winegrowing]] by way of hoe-farming as a monument of this traditional form of cultivation.

The name of Porta, meaning Porta Coeli – i.e. Pearly Gates – , refers to the architecture of the richly ornamented western façade of the minster with its Roman triumphal arch portal and a gallery underneath the crucifixion group that did not at all correspond to the strict stipulations of the order.

==== Architecture ====
[[File:Facade of Monastery Pforta.jpg|thumb|left|Facade of Monastery Pforta]]
The [[minster (church)|minster]] was built in the 1130s in the plain character of the [[Cistercian architecture|Cistercians monasteries]].&lt;ref name="Jeep"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeep|first=John M.|title=Germany. An Encyclopedia.|date=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780203801765|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1251, the Cistercians decided on an ambitious building project. Even though the new church building with its west façade was still ascetic in the interior decor, it clearly reflected the significant economic and political power of the monastery. The Gothic [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] of the minster is the architectural example of the regional [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] reception with French roots, transferring the latest shapes and forms inspired by French Gothic design and adapting them to local conditions. The glass paintings of the church, including in Europe’s oldest Cistercian tracery rose window preserved almost completely together with its glazing, are an extraordinary treasure of medieval paintings.
[[File:Chapel of Monastery Pforta.jpg|thumb|Chapel of Monastery Pforta]]
The so-called Abbot’s Chapel (Abtskapelle) is considered to be an outstanding architectural example of the medieval infirmaries and nursing wards of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]]. Before its conversion into an [[abbot]]’s home, it had been part of the infirmary wing, allowing people to participate in the mass from there. Rare elements were found in the structure such as the latrine and the chamber of the [[Hospital|infirmary]].

==== Hydraulic system ====
In 1180, the [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]] created the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] mill race called ″Kleine Saale″ (Little Saale), a [[canal]] of 10 kilometers length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Kulturlandschaft um Schulpforta.

The Benedictine monks of St George, the canons of St Moritz in Naumburg, and the Naumburg cathedral chapter participated in the costs and maintenance of the Kleine Saale in return for rights of utilization. Maintenance work was managed by a water expert from Pforta Monastery and the highest-ranking fisherman from the Naumburg. The Kleine Saale shows the Cistercian [[hydraulic engineering]] at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Wirtschaftstätigkeit der Zisterzienser im Mittelalter, Agrarwirtschaft.''In:'' Wirtschaft und Kulturlandschaft.|pages=84–112|trans-title=The economy of the Cisterciansin the Middle-Ages.

==== Grange ====
The Romanesque House is an impressive piece of evidence of a former [[Monastic grange|grange]] of Pforta Monastery that was constructed to ensure economic independence. They were run by bearded lay brothers (conversi). The foundation of those granges was made possible because many rulers assigned possessions in return for burial rights for family members on the monastery grounds. The Cistercians successfully sold agricultural and craft products on the markets in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], Naumburg, [[Jena]] and [[Erfurt]]. With even greater success, they managed to enlist parts of the peasant population into their service, offering the liege lords compensation payments for their release from personal bondage. As a result of its aggressive economic policy of establishing granges, Pforta acquired a charter in 1215 to transport carts and loads through the [[Margravate of Meissen|margraviates of Meissen]] and [[Lower Lusatia]] – and thus to [[Silesia]] – without being charged [[tax]]es or dues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Das Zisterzienserkloster Pforte: die Urkundenfälschungen und die frühe Geschichte bis 1236.|trans-title=The Cistercian monastery Pforta: Document fraud and early history until 1236.|author=Kunde, Holger|publisher=Böhlau Verlag|date=2003|language=German.|isbn=9783412146016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Winemaking ====
The Cistercian monks set about profitably using the land they had bought in a single-minded, well-planned and versatile way. Economic activities of the Cistercians included quarrying, the planting of vines on the slopes of the Saale and other suitable areas, the planting of [[orchard]]s, the establishment of smithies, workshops for weaving, fur production and shoe-making, the setting-up of bakeries and cheese dairies as well as intense sheep rearing, grain growing, timber rafting and fishing. The Cistercians expanded their property from the Köppelberg vineyard, and created nine steep [[Vineyard|slope vineyards]] between 1195 and 1208. At the end of the [[Middle Ages]], the monastery owned 58 vineyards between Bad Kösen and Roßbach. Cellar and wine masters at Pforta ensured high quality in wine making, measuring it according to vinum bonum (1226), vinum melius (1289) or vinum terrestre (country wine, around 1340).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Zisterzienser und ihre Weinberge in Brandenburg.Studien zur Geschichte, Kunst und Kultur der Zisterzienser.|trans-title=The Cistercians and their vineyards in Brandenburg.

== History ==
[[File:Sandstone, Saale-Unstrut.jpg|thumb|Sandstone, Saale-Unstrut]]
The area provided moderate climate, fertile soils, rich water sources and wood supply through forests and was populated by [[Stone Age]] hunters 380 000 years ago . From the [[Neolithic Age]]  onwards throughout all [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]], the area was settled.&lt;ref name="Bogucki"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bogucki|first=Peter|title=Forest Farmers and Stockherders. Early Agriculture and its consequences in North-Central Europe.|date=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521329590|pages=93–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Early Middle Ages ===
[[File:Ebersorda.jpg|thumb|Ebersorda]]
The [[Migration Period]]  brought decisive changes from 375 AD onwards and also had an influence on the [[Saale-Unstrut|Saale-Unstrut region]]. The local population, consisting of migrating [[Germanic peoples|Germanic Varini]] and Angles, merged to form the [[Thuringians]]. Following the defeat of the Thuringian army by Frankish troops in 531, the [[Merovingians]] as Frankish rulers settled groups of [[Frisians]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and probably also [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessians]] to the south and north of the Unstrut in exchange for payment of [[Lay Tithes|tithes]].&lt;ref name="Steuer"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Fries-Knoblach|editor-first=Janine|editor2-last=Steuer|editor2-first=Heiko|title=The Baiuvarii and Thuring|last=Steuer|first=Heiko|chapter=Thuringians and Bavarians – Location in Space and Time and Social Relations|year=2014|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn= 9781843839156|pages=111–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dumminger"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Wood|editor-first=Ian|title=Franks and Alamanni in the Merovingian Period: An Ethnographic Perspective|last=Dumminger|first=Areas F.|chapter=Dwellings, settlements and settlement patterns of the sixth and seventh centuries in southwest Germany and adjacent areas.|year=2014|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn= 9781843830351|pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These settlers were met by [[Sorbs (tribe)|Slav Sorb tribes]] originating from the region of the [[Dnieper]], who came westward as far as the [[Saale|River Saale]], crossed it repeatedly and beginning to settle on its western banks. The [[Sorbs]]  had more than 50 civitates, meaning central strongholds with relating settlements. Such a fortified district or “Gau” developed on the site of today’s town of Naumburg and was called “Wethau”; the centre was a Sorb castle complex in Wettaburg (now an urban district of Naumburg) .
The region by the Saale and Unstrut rivers had thus become a sensitive border area because it marked the border between the peoples of Germanic and [[Slavs|Slav]] origin and also the north-eastern border of [[Christianity]] in continental [[Europe]].
&lt;ref name="Stone2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Gerald|title=The smallest slavonic nation.

A sourcebook.|date=2014|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=9781441106261|page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 766, a successful Frankish attack was launched against Wettaburg Castle, that was the headquarters of the [[Sorbs]] in the Saale-Unstrut region. The [[Frankish empire|Frankish Empire]] was at its largest during the reign of [[Pepin the Short|Pippin]]’s son [[Charlemagne]] (768 – 814).
&lt;ref name="Reuther"&gt;{{cite book|last=Story|first=Johanna|title=Charlemagne: Empire and Society.|date=2005|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719070891|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a very bloody war lasting almost thirty years (772 – 804), the pagan [[Saxons]] were conquered and their territory was fully integrated into the [[Frankish empire|Frankish Empire]]. As elsewhere, Christianization ran parallel to military subjugation in the Saxon area.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Richard A.|title=The Barbarian Conversion: From Paganism to Christianity.|date=1999|publisher=University of California Press|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Saale]] remained the lasting natural border with the Slavic territories. In conjunction with the hinterland, the Saale was protected from possible attacks from the east by a chain of closely neighboring strongholds and fortifications,including the ″[[Limes Sorabicus]]″. &lt;br /&gt;
The territory of the [[Frankish Empire]] extended in the first quarter of the [[9th century]] from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west to the Elbe and Saale in the east, from the [[North Sea]] in the north to [[Central Italy]] in the south.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Michael E.|title=A Sacred Kingdom: Bishops and the Rise of Frankish Kingship|date=2011|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|isbn=9780813218779|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus most of Christian Europe was united in [[Charlemagne]]’s hands.  However, Charlemagne’s successors were not able to maintain Imperial unity.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=Charlemagne.|date=1998|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780333650554|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 919, Heinrich, the duke of Saxony, also known as [[Henry the Fowler]], became king of the Franks and the Saxons. As a result, the Saale-Unstrut region moved from a peripheral position in the Frankish empire to the focus of political interest. Heinrich expanded his power along the eastern border of the Empire by conquering the Slav tribes (928/929) and defeating the [[Hungarians]] by the Unstrut in 933.&lt;ref name="Emmerson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emmerson|first=Richard K.|title=Key Figures in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedi.|date=2013|publisher=Routeledge|isbn=9780415973854|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Heinrich I’s expansion policy and the conquest of the Slav tribes, the character of the area east of the Saale and Unstrut changed from a direct border area to a connecting region between the old settlement land to the west and the newly conquered regions by the Elbe.&lt;ref name="Leyser"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leyser|first=Karl|title=Medieval Germany and its Neighbours, 900-1250.|date=1982|publisher=A&amp;C Black|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
With the consent of the Pope and the German Imperial bishops, the Emperor arranged for [[diocese]]s and bishop’s churches to be established in [[Merseburg Cathedral|Merseburg]], [[Zeitz]] and [[Meissen]] in 968, forming a new church province for the eastern part of the Empire within the equally newly founded [[archbishopric of Magdeburg]].

==== The High Middle Ages ====
[[File:Schleberoda.jpg|thumb|Schleberoda]]
From the [[10th century]] onwards, the Ekkehardine dynasty gained influence in the Empire. Contemporaneous Bishop [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] described the first prominent representative of this house, [[Ekkehard I]], as a person with an outstanding lack of humility ″He was an ornament to the Empire, a treasure of the land, a hope for his subjects and a terror to his enemies and he would have been completely perfect if he had only been able to remain humble″.&lt;ref name="Merseburg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Merseburg|first=Thietmar of|title=Chronicles V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After the murder of the margrave Ekkehard I on 30 April 1002, Ekkehard’s sons, Margrave Hermann (1009 – 1038) and [[Eckard II, Margrave of Meissen|Margrave Ekkehard II]] (1009 – 1046), assumed power in 1009. They became the most powerful rulers in the eastern part of the Empire and moved their family seat from Kleinjena to the ″Neue Burg″ (New Castle, Naumburg). The rise of Naumburg as ecclesiastical, political, cultural and economic centre of the Saale-Unstrut region had begun.&lt;ref name="Bagge"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bagge|first=Sverre|title=Kings, Politics, and the Right Order of the World in German Historiography: C. 950-1150.|date=2002|publisher=Brill|isbn=9780415973854|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it has to be emphasized that Sorb ″Smurds″ and German residents lived largely peacefully alongside each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Slaven und Deutsche.

[[File:Certificate Emperor Conrad.tif|thumb|Certificate Emperor Conrad]]
The [[bishops of Naumburg]], the [[Landgrave of Thuringia|landgraves of Thuringia]] and the [[margraves of Meissen]] as lords of the town of Naumburg promoted a systematic development of the city into the most important town in the Saale-Unstrut region. In March 1131, Bishop Udo I met the Cistercian abbot [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] at the Imperial Diet in Liège in March 1131, a meeting of central significance for the propagation of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian order]] in the Empire. As a result, a delegation of monks from the Walkenried Cistercian monastery moved to a location next to Naumburg in 1137/1138. The founding of the Cistercian Pforta Monastery contributed to the propagation of the Order on to Eastern Europe. One of the greatest achievements of Pforta Monastery was furthermore the settlement of peasants in these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Mittelalter.|trans-title=Middle Ages. |author=Müller, Harald|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co|date=2008|language=German|isbn=9783050043661}}&lt;/ref&gt; This so-called ″Landesausbau″ in the High Middle Ages was supplemented by military protection of the positions already achieved.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Due to increase of population, new public assignments of protection and administration for the diocese of Naumburg led to crucial changes in social structure. The prestige attained by the Naumburg bishop’s seat is expressed by the construction of a new cathedral around 1210 during the period of office of Bishop Engelhard (1206 – 1242).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
For the Saale-Unstrut region, the Ludowingers were, together with the Wettin dynasty, the most influential aristocratic dynasty during the 12th and the 13th century. The Ludowingers created a princely court culture modeled to equal royal forms. The magnificent court of Count Palatine Hermann of Saxony (1181 – 1217) at Neuenburg Castle was an extremely important center of literary activities in the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Im Schatten der Landgrafen: Studien zur adeligen Herrschaftsbildung im hochmittelalterlichen Thüringen.|trans-title=In the shadow of the margraves.

The [[Wettin, Saxony-Anhalt|Wettins]], with Margrave Heinrich the Illustrious (1221 – 1288), were appointed as margraves to the east of the Saale. They were able to expand their territories and achieved political dominance in the whole Central German region during the [[13th century in Germany|13th century]], creating most favorable conditions for their homelands in the Saale-Unstrut region. The cooperation of the Cistercians with the Wettin and [[Ludovingians|Ludowinger]] dynasties contributed to the transfer of spiritual, cultural and technological knowledge into the areas intended for colonization. Nevertheless, the economic emphasis moved gradually towards the east during the [[Late Middle Ages]], when the importance of the relatively young [[Leipzig|town of Leipzig]] outdid that of the old trade fair town of Naumburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Bedeutung der Zisterzienser für die Ostsiedlung, besonders in Ostschlesien.|trans-title=The importance of the Cistercians for the Eastern Settlement|page=68|author=Gottschalck, Joseph|publisher=Zeitschrift für Ostforschung|date=1966|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From the late Middle Ages to the Present ===
Following the [[Reformation]] instigated by [[Martin Luther]](1485 – 1546) in nearby [[Wittenberg]], the Wettins and the region’s nobility turned to [[Protestantism]], promoting and funding the reformers. As a result of the alliance of Protestant rulers and spiritual leaders, the monasteries and religious establishments in Naumburg, Goseck, Zscheiplitz and Pforta were closed between 1533 and 1540 and their endowments and properties confiscated. Only the property rights held by the Naumburg Cathedral chapter remained untouched.&lt;ref name="Ocker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ocker|first=Christopher|title=Church Robbers and Reformers in Germany, 1525-1547: Confiscation and Religious Purpose in the Holy Roman Empire.|date=2006|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=9789004152069|pages=50–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Vineyard Steinmeister.jpg|thumb|Vineyard Steinmeister]]
From the [[18th century]] on, the castles along the Saale and Unstrut amidst their cultural landscape became prime subjects of [[Romanticism|romantic]] admiration. As a result of the [[First Congress of Vienna|Congress of Vienna]], the [[kingdom of Saxony]] was forced to cede territories to the Prussian king in 1815. The landscape by the [[Saale]] and [[Unstrut]] now became part of the [[Prussian state]] until the end of the [[Second World War]]. Unlike many other regions, no drastic changes due to [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] altered this landscape.
It was due to Walter Hege’s photographs published in 1925, that the founder figure of [[Uta of Schauenburg|Uta]] became enormously popular but was exploited during the [[National Socialists]]’ regime. The regime turned Neuenburg Castle into a training centre for senior leaders of the German Girls’ Association (BDM) and the school at Pforta Monastery into a National Political Education Centre (NAPOLA) until the end of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Forschungen zum Kloster Schulpforta: Ergebnisse eines Arbeitsprojektes im Rahmen des Graduiertenkollegs "Kunstwissenschaft-Bauforschung-Denkmalpflege" der Otto-Friedrich-Universität Bamberg und der Technischen Universität Berlin.|trans-title=Research on Monastery Pforta: Results of a working project and the Technical University Berlin. |author=Hubel, Achim; Cramer, Johannes|publisher=Janos Stekovics|date=2003|language=German|isbn=9783899230253}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The Saale-Unstrut region was spared destruction during the [[Second World War]]. The liberation by American troops in the spring of 1945 was followed in the summer of the same year by hand-over of the area to the [[Red Army]] and the Saale-Unstrut region thus became part of [[East Germany]] (GDR). There was no attempt in the Saale-Unstrut area to demolish old town quarters. After the [[Reunification of Germany|reunification of the two German states]] in 1990 the well-preserved cultural landscape of the Saale-Unstrut region became part of the [[Saxony-Anhalt|Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt]].

'''Neurogenetics''' studies the role of [[genetics]] in the development and function of the [[nervous system]]. It considers neural characteristics as [[phenotype]]s (i.e. manifestations, measurable or not, of the genetic make-up of an individual), and is mainly based on the observation that the nervous systems of individuals, even of those belonging to the same [[species]], may not be identical. As the name implies, it draws aspects from both the studies of [[neuroscience]] and genetics, focusing in particular how the genetic code an organism carries affects its expressed [[Phenotypic trait|traits]]. [[Mutation]]s in this genetic sequence can have a wide range of effects on the quality of life of the individual. Neurological diseases, behavior and personality are all studied in the context of neurogenetics. The field of neurogenetics emerged in the mid to late 1900s with advances closely following advancements made in available technology. Currently, neurogenetics is the center of much research utilizing cutting edge techniques.

==History==
The field of neurogenetics emerged from advances made in molecular biology, genetics and a desire to understand the link between genes, behavior, the brain, and neurological disorders and diseases. The field started to expand in the 1960s through the research of [[Seymour Benzer]], considered by some to be the father of neurogenetics.&lt;ref name="Olypmians"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.caltech.edu/talk-archive/index.html|title=Olympians of Science: A Display of Medals and Awards |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=5 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Seymour Benzer.gif|thumb|Seymour Benzer in his office at Caltech in 1974 with a big model of Drosophila]] His pioneering work with ''[[Drosophila]]'' helped to elucidate the link between circadian rhythms and genes, which led to further investigations into other behavior traits. He also started conducting research in neurodegeneration in fruit flies in an attempt to discover ways to suppress neurological diseases in humans. Many of the techniques he used and conclusions he drew would drive the field forward.&lt;ref name="CalTech"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/13076 |title=Neurogenetics Pioneer Seymour Benzer Dies |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=5 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120073420/http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/13076 |archivedate=20 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Early analysis relied on statistical interpretation through processes such as [[genetic linkage|LOD]] (logarithm of odds) scores of [[pedigree chart|pedigrees]] and other observational methods such as affected sib-pairs, which looks at phenotype and [[identity by descent|IBD]] (identity by descent) configuration. Many of the disorders studied early on including [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]], [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's]] and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) are still at the center of much research to this day.&lt;ref name=Gershon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gershon|first=Elliot S.|author2=Lynn R.

This process is referred to sometimes as linkage analysis.&lt;ref name=Tanzi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tanzi|first=R.E.|title=Genetic linkage studies of human neurodegenerative disorders|journal=Curr Opin Neurobiol|date=Oct 1991|volume=1|issue=3|pages=455–461|pmid=1840379|doi=10.1016/0959-4388(91)90069-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenstein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenstein|first=P|author2=T.D.

This decade saw a marked increase in identifying the specific role genes played in relation to neurological disorders. Advancements were made in but not limited to: [[Fragile X syndrome]], Alzheimer’s, [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson’s]], [[epilepsy]] and ALS.&lt;ref name=Tandon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tandon|first=P.N.|title=The decade of the brain: a brief review|journal=Neurol India|date=Sep 2000|volume=48|issue=3|pages=199–207|pmid=11025621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurological disorders==
While the genetic basis of simple diseases and disorders has been accurately pinpointed, the genetics behind more complex, neurological disorders is still a source of ongoing research. New developments such as the [[Genome-wide association study|genome wide association studies]] (GWAS) have brought vast new resources within grasp. With this new information genetic variability within the human population and possibly linked diseases can be more readily discerned.&lt;ref name=Simone-Sanchez&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simon-Sanchez|first=J|author2=A. Singleton|title=Genome-wide association studies in neurological disorders|journal=Lancet Neurol|year=2008|volume=7|pages=1067–1072|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(08)70241-2|pmid=18940696|issue=11|pmc=2824165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurodegenerative diseases are a more common subset of neurological disorders, with examples being [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]]. Currently no viable treatments exist that actually reverse the progression of neurodegenerative diseases; however, neurogenetics is emerging as one field that might yield a causative connection. The discovery of linkages could then lead to therapeutic drugs, which could reverse brain degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=A|author2=Cookson MR|title=Role of LRRK2 kinase dysfunction in Parkinson disease|journal=Expert Rev Mol Med|date=June 2011|volume=13|issue=20|pmid=21676337|pages=e20|doi=10.1017/S146239941100192X|pmc=4672634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gene sequencing==
One of the most noticeable results of further research into neurogenetics is a greater knowledge of gene loci that show linkage to neurological diseases. The table below represents a sampling of specific gene locations identified to play a role in selected neurological diseases based on prevalence in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=PD /&gt;&lt;ref name=AD /&gt;&lt;ref name=MS /&gt;&lt;ref name=HD /&gt;

==Methods of research==

===Statistical analysis===
[[Genetic linkage|Logarithm of odds (LOD)]] is a statistical technique used to estimate the probability of gene linkage between traits. LOD is often used in conjunction with pedigrees, maps of a family’s genetic make-up, in order to yield more accurate estimations.  A key benefit of this technique is its ability to give reliable results in both large and small sample sizes, which is a marked advantage in laboratory research.&lt;ref&gt;N E Morton (1996). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC39633/journal.pmed.8622960 Logarithm of odds (lods) for linkage on complex inheritance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helms, Ted (2000) [http://www.ag.ndsu.nodak.edu/plantsci/adv_genetics/genetics/lod/lod02.htm Logarithm of Odds in Advanced Genetics].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quantitative trait locus|Quantitative trait loci (QTL)]] mapping is another statistical method used to determine the chromosomal positions of a set of genes responsible for a given trait.  By identifying specific genetic markers for the genes of interest in a [[recombinant inbred strain]], the amount of interaction between these genes and their relation to the observed phenotype can be determined through complex statistical analysis.  
In a neurogenetics laboratory, the phenotype of a model organisms is observed by assessing the morphology of their brain through thin slices.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Williams (1998) [http://www.nervenet.org/papers/shortcourse98.html Neuroscience Meets Quantitative Genetics: Using Morphometric Data to Map Genes that Modulate CNS Architecture].&lt;/ref&gt;  QTL mapping can also be carried out in humans, though brain morphologies are examined using [[Magnetic resonance imaging|nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]] rather than brain slices. Human beings pose a greater challenge for QTL analysis because the genetic population cannot be as carefully controlled as that of an inbred recombinant population, which can result in sources of statistical error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bartley | first1 = AJ | last2 = Jones | first2 = DW | last3 = Weinberger | first3 = DR | year = 1997 | title = Genetic variability of human brain size and cortical gyral patterns | url = http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/120/2/257.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Brain | volume = 120 | issue = 2| pages = 257–269 | doi = 10.1093/brain/120.2.257 | pmid=9117373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recombinant DNA===
[[Recombinant DNA]] is an important method of research in many fields, including neurogenetics.  It is used to make alterations to an organism’s genome, usually causing it to over- or under-express a certain gene of interest, or express a mutated form of it.  The results of these experiments can provide information on that gene’s role in the organism’s body, and it importance in survival and fitness. The hosts are then screened with the aid of a toxic drug that the selectable marker is resistant to. The use of recombinant DNA is an example of a reverse genetics, where researchers create a mutant genotype and analyze the resulting phenotype.  In [[forward genetics]], an organism with a particular phenotype is identified first, and its genotype is then analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;Kuure-Kinsey, Matthew; McCooey, Beth (2006). [http://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem-eng/Biotech-Environ/Projects00/rdna/rdna.html The Basics of Recombinant DNA].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, Victor (2011). [http://wormbook.org/chapters/www_introreversegenetics/introreversegenetics.html Reverse Genetics].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal research===
[[File:Drosophila.jpg|thumb|Drosophila]][[File:Zebrafisch.jpg|thumb|Zebrafish]]
Model organisms are an important tool in many areas of research, including the field of neurogenetics.  By studying creatures with simpler nervous systems and with smaller genomes, scientists can better understand their biological processes and apply them to more complex organisms, such as humans.  Due to their low-maintenance and highly mapped genomes, mice, ''[[Drosophila]]'',&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer"&gt;Pfeiffer, Barret D, et al. (2008) [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/28/9715.full Tools for neuroanatomy and neurogenetics in ''Drosophila''].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Caenorhabditis elegans|''C. elegans'']]&lt;ref name="Rand"&gt;Rand, James B, Duerr, Janet S, Frisby, Dennis L (2000) [http://www.fasebj.org/content/14/15/2414.full.pdf Neurogenetics of vesicular transporters in ''C. elegans''].&lt;/ref&gt; are very common.  [[Zebrafish]]&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;Burgess, Harold A, Granato, Michael (2008) [http://bfg.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/6/474.short The neurogenetic frontier – lessons from misbehaving zebrafish].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[prairie vole]]s&lt;ref&gt;McGraw, Lisa A, Young, Larry J (2009) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223609001982 The prairie vole: and emerging model organism for understanding the social brain].&lt;/ref&gt; have also become more common, especially in the social and behavioral scopes of neurogenetics.

In addition to examining how genetic mutations affect the actual structure of the brain, researchers in neurogenetics also examine how these mutations affect cognition and behavior. One method of examining this involves purposely engineering model organisms with mutations of certain genes of interest. These animals are then classically conditioned to perform certain types of tasks, such as pulling a lever in order to gain a reward. The speed of their learning, the retention of the learned behavior, and other factors are then compared to the results of healthy organisms to determine what kind of an effect – if any – the mutation has had on these higher processes. The results of this research can help identify genes that may be associated with conditions involving cognitive and learning deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbc.jhu.edu/research/posters.html Neurogenetics and Behavior Center. Johns Hopkins U, 2011. Web. 29 Oct. 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human research===
Many research facilities seek out volunteers with certain conditions or illnesses to participate in studies. Model organisms, while important, cannot completely model the complexity of the human body, making volunteers a key part to the progression of research. Along with gathering some basic information about medical history and the extent of their symptoms, samples are taken from the participants, including blood, [[cerebrospinal fluid]], and/or muscle tissue. These tissue samples are then genetically sequenced, and the genomes are added to current database collections. The growth of these data bases will eventually allow researchers to better understand the genetic nuances of these conditions and bring therapy treatments closer to reality. Current areas of interest in this field have a wide range, spanning anywhere from the maintenance of [[circadian rhythms]],&lt;ref&gt;Fu, Ying-Hui, and Louis Ptacek, dirs. "Research Projects."

==Behavioral neurogenetics==
&lt;!-- Behavioral neurogenetics and Behavioural neurogenetics redirect here --&gt;
{{Main|Behavioural genetics}}
Advances in [[molecular biology]] techniques and the species-wide [[Human Genome Project|genome project]] have made it possible to map out an individual's entire genome. Whether genetic or environmental factors are primarily responsible for an individual's personality has long been a topic of debate.&lt;ref name="Congdon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimura"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kimura |first1=Mitsuru |last2=Higuchi |first2=Susumu |title= Genetics of Alcohol Dependence |journal= Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=213–25 |year=2011 |type=Print |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2011.02190.x |pmid=21507127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the advances being made in the field of neurogenetics, researchers have begun to tackle this question by beginning to map out genes and correlate them to different personality traits.&lt;ref name="Congdon"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Congdon |first1=Eliza |last2=Canli |first2=Turhan |title= A Neurogenetic Approach to Impulsivity |journal= Journal of Personality |volume=76 |issue=6 |pages= 1447–84 |year=2008 |type=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little to no evidence to suggest that the presence of a ''single'' gene indicates that an individual will express one style of behavior over another; rather, having a specific gene could make one more predisposed to displaying this type of behavior.  It is starting to become clear that most genetically influenced behaviors are due to the effects of many variants within ''many'' genes, in addition to other neurological regulating factors like neurotransmitter levels.  Due to fact that many behavioral characteristics have been conserved across species for generations, researchers are able to use animal subjects such as mice and rats, but also fruit flies, worms, and zebrafish,&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt; to try to determine specific genes that correlate to behavior and attempt to match these with human genes.&lt;ref name="Reaume"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reaume |first1=Christopher J. |last2=Sokolowski |first2=Marla B. |title=Conservation of Gene Function in Behavior |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |volume=366 |issue=1574 |pages=2100–2110 |year=2011 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2011.0028|pmc=3130371 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-species gene conservation===
While it is true that variation between species can appear to be pronounced, at their most basic they share many similar behavior traits which are necessary for survival. Such traits include mating, aggression, foraging, social behavior and sleep patterns. This conservation of behavior across species has led biologists to hypothesize that these traits could possibly have similar, if not the same, genetic causes and pathways. Studies conducted on the genomes of a plethora of organisms have revealed that many organisms have [[Homology (biology)|homologous genes]], meaning that some genetic material has been [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] between species.  If these organisms shared a common evolutionary ancestor, then this might imply that aspects of behavior can be inherited from previous generations, lending support to the genetic causes – as opposed to the environmental causes – of behavior.&lt;ref name="Kimura"/&gt; Variations in personalities and behavioral traits seen amongst individuals of the same species could be explained by differing levels of expression of these genes and their corresponding proteins.&lt;ref name="Reaume"/&gt;

===Aggression===
There is also research being conducted on how an individual's genes can cause varying levels of [[aggression]] and aggression control {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}.[[File:Mad dog.jpg|thumb|Outward displays of aggression are seen in most animals]] Throughout the animal kingdom, varying styles, types and levels of aggression can be observed leading scientists to believe that there might be a genetic contribution that has conserved this particular behavioral trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zwarts|first=Liesbeth|last2=Magwire|first2=Michael M.|last3=Carbone|first3=Mary Anna|last4=Versteven|first4=Marijke|last5=Herteleer|first5=Liesbet|last6=Anholt|first6=Robert R.

==Development==
[[File:Shh Gradient In Neural Tube.svg|thumb|Shh and BMP gradient in the neural tube]] A great deal of research has been done on the effects of genes and the formation of the brain and the central nervous system. The following wiki links may prove helpful:

*[[Neural development]]
*[[Neurogenesis]]
*[[Brain#Development|The Brain]]
*[[Neural tube]]

There are many genes and proteins that contribute to the formation and development of the central nervous system, many of which can be found in the aforementioned links. Of particular importance are those that code for [[Bone morphogenetic protein|BMPs]], BMP inhibitors and [[Sonic hedgehog|''SHH'']]. When expressed during early development, BMP's are responsible for the differentiation of epidermal cells from the ventral [[ectoderm]]. Inhibitors of BMPs, such as [[Noggin (protein)|''NOG'']] and [[Chordin|''CHRD'']], promote differentiation of ectoderm cells into prospective neural tissue on the dorsal side. If any of these genes are improperly regulated, then proper formation and differentiation will not occur. 
BMP also plays a very important role in the patterning that occurs after the formation of the [[neural tube]]. Due to the graded response the cells of the neural tube have to BMP and Shh signaling, these pathways are in competition to determine the fate of preneural cells. BMP promotes dorsal differentiation of pre-neural cells into [[sensory neurons]] and Shh promotes ventral differentiation into [[motor neurons]]. There are many other genes that help to determine neural fate and proper development include, [[Reelin|''RELN'']], [[Sox9|''SOX9'']], [[Wnt signaling pathway|''WNT'']], [[Notch signaling pathway|Notch and Delta coding genes]], [[Hox gene|''HOX'']], and various cadherin coding genes like [[CDH1 (gene)|''CDH1'']] and ''[[CDH2]]''.&lt;ref name="Alberts"&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |last= Alberts|edition=5th  |year=2008 |publisher=Garland Science |isbn=0-8153-4105-9 |pages=1139–1480 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent research has shown that the level of gene expression changes drastically in the brain at different periods throughout the life cycle.  For example, during prenatal development the amount of [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] in the brain (an indicator of gene expression) is exceptionally high, and drops to a significantly lower level not long after birth.  The only other point of the life cycle during which expression is this high is during the mid- to late-life period, during 50–70 years of age.  While the increased expression during the prenatal period can be explained by the rapid growth and formation of the brain tissue, the reason behind the surge of late-life expression remains a topic of ongoing research.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Sanders (2011). [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/335629/title/Brain_gene_activity_changes_through_life Brain gene activity changes through life]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==
Neurogenetics is a field that is rapidly expanding and growing.  The current areas of research are very diverse in their focuses.  One area deals with molecular processes and the function of certain proteins, often in conjunction with cell signaling and neurotransmitter release, cell development and repair, or neuronal plasticity.  Behavioral and cognitive areas of research continue to expand in an effort to pinpoint contributing genetic factors. As a result of the expanding neurogenetics field a better understanding of specific neurological disorders and phenotypes has arisen with direct correlation to [[Mutation|genetic mutations]]. With severe disorders such as [[epilepsy]], brain malformations, or [[mental retardation]] a single [[gene]] or causative condition has been identified 60% of the time; however, the milder the intellectual handicap the lower chance a specific genetic cause has been pinpointed. [[Autism]] for example is only linked to a specific, mutated gene about 15–20% of the time while the mildest forms of mental handicaps are only being accounted for genetically less than 5% of the time. Research in neurogenetics has yielded some promising results, though, in that mutations at specific gene loci have been linked to harmful phenotypes and their resulting disorders. For instance a [[frameshift mutation]] or a [[missense mutation]] at the [[Doublecortin|''DCX'' gene]] location causes a neuronal migration defect also known as [[lissencephaly]]. Another example is the ''[[ROBO3]]'' gene where a mutation alters [[axon]] length negatively impacting neuronal connections. Horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS) accompanies a mutation here.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=C|author2=Engle E|title=Allelic diversity in human developmental neurogenetics: insights into biology and disease|journal=Neuron|year=2010|volume=68|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2010.09.042|pmid=20955932|issue=2|pages=245–53|pmc=3010396}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are just a few examples of what current research in the field of neurogenetics has achieved.&lt;ref&gt;"This Week In the Journal."

[[File:Ossia-vclo.jpg|thumb|360px|Ossia example (2nd bar).&lt;br /&gt;{{audio|Ossia-vclo.mid|Play original}} {{audio|Ossia-vclo-ossia.mid|Play ossia}}]]
'''''{{Lang|it|Ossia}}''''' {{IPA-it|osˈsiːa|}} is a musical term for an alternative passage which may be played instead of the original passage. The word ''[[Wikt:ossia|ossia]]'' comes from the Italian for "alternatively" and was originally spelled ''o sia'', meaning "or be it" (Fallows 774).

''Ossia'' passages are very common in [[opera]] and solo-[[piano]] works. They are usually an easier version of the preferred form of passage, but in [[Mily Balakirev]]'s ''[[Islamey]]'', for instance, the [[Urtext edition|urtext]] has ossia passages of both types (simpler and more difficult). [[Bel canto]] vocal music also frequently uses ''ossia'', also called ''[[Wikt:oppure|oppure]]'', passages to illustrate a more embellished version of the vocal line (Fallows 774).

On the other hand, an ''ossia'' marking does not always indicate a change in difficulty; the piano solo music of [[Franz Liszt]] is typically full of alternative passages, often no easier or more difficult than the rest of the piece. This reflects Liszt's desire to leave his options open during a performance. Many of his ''ossia'' passages are [[cadenza]]s.

An unusual use of ''ossia'' is found in Alban Berg's [[Violin Concerto (Berg)|Violin Concerto]] where several ''ossia'' parts are included for the solo violin. If the soloist chooses to play these, the [[concertmaster]] is required to play a different ossia (which takes part of the solo violin line that is lost in favor of the soloist's ossia).

==Leagacy in exposure science==
Lioy’s reputation evolved primarily based upon his role in developing scientific principles and refining the approaches that define the field of exposure science. This discipline is associated with the field of environmental and occupational health sciences, which includes epidemiology and risk assessment, and prevention. In a 1990 article published in Environmental Science and Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | year = 1990 | title = The analysis of total human exposure for exposure assessment: a multi-discipline science for examining human contact with contaminants | url = | journal = Environmental Science and Technology | volume = 24 | issue = 7| pages = 938–945 | doi=10.1021/es00077a001}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was the first to properly locate exposure science as the bridge between traditional environmental sciences and the understanding of human health outcomes.  Building upon the work of occupational hygiene and the work of Wayne Ott,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ott | first1 = WR | year = 1995 | title = Human exposure assessment: the birth of a new science | url = | journal = Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 449–472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lioy has clearly shown that the most important aspect of total human exposure is whether or not an individual comes into contact with a toxin, discussed in a 2010 review article on exposure science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | year = 2010 | title = Exposure Science: A View of the Past and Major Milestones for the Future | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 118 | issue = 8| pages = 1081–1090 | doi=10.1289/ehp.0901634 | pmid=20308034 | pmc=2920079}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his recent{{when|date=July 2017}} book on exposure science.&lt;ref&gt;Lioy PJ, Weisel C. 2014. Exposure Science: Basic Principles and Applications. Oxford, UK: Academic Press, Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter he has clearly linked external and internal markers of exposure.  Thus, prevention is a key part of the application of this field of science. He re-analyzed the work of the "father of occupational medicine", [[Bernardino Ramazzini]] who provided the initial reasons for examining contact with an agent to define ways to control occupational illness. This historical analysis can be used to improve the way exposure science evolves in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | year = 2007 | title = Bernardino Ramazzini: thoughts on his Treatise and linking exposure science and environmental/occupational medicine for prevention or intervention within environmental health | url = | journal = European Journal of Oncology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 69–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lioy is also a Fellow of the Collegium Ramazzini.

Lioy has been a central figure in understanding exposure to the air pollutant [[tropospheric ozone]], [[chloroform]] and other toxicant exposures from shower water, [[hexavalent chromium]] wastes, and most recently, the exposures derived from the dust and smoke released in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="Lioy PJ 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Pellizzari | first2 = E | last3 = Prezant | first3 = D | year = 2006 | title = The World Trade Center Aftermath and Its Effects on Health: Understanding and Learning Through Human-Exposure Science | url = | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 40 | issue = 22| pages = 6876–6885 | doi=10.1021/es062980e}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been a major figure in defining some of the basic data requirements (and providing exposure indices) for examining human exposures within the [[National Children's Study]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Isukapalli | first2 = S | last3 = Trasande | first3 = L | last4 = Thorpe | first4 = L | last5 = Dellarco | first5 = M | last6 = Weisel | first6 = C | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 2009 | title = Using national and local extant data to characterize environmental exposures in the National Children's Study (NCS): Queens County, New York | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 117 | issue = 10| pages = 1494–1504 | doi=10.1289/ehp.0900623 | pmid=20019897 | pmc=2790501}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Co-Principal Investigator within the portion of the National Human Exposure Assessment Survey (NHEXAS) conducted in five mid-western states, led by Edo Pellizzari of [[Research Triangle Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pellizzari | first1 = E | last2 = Lioy | first2 = PJ | last3 = Quackenboss | first3 = J | last4 = Whitmore | first4 = R | last5 = Clayton | first5 = A | last6 = Freeman | first6 = N | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 1995 | title = The design and implementation of phase I national human exposure assessment study in EPA Region V | url = | journal = Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 327–358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently his research addresses human exposure to engineered nanotechnology consumer products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = P.J. | last2 = Nazarenko | first2 = Y. | last3 = Han | first3 = T.W. | last4 = Lioy | first4 = M.J. | last5 = Mainelis | first5 = G. | year = 2010 | title = Nanotechnology and Exposure Science What Is Needed To Fill the Research and Data Gaps for Consumer Products | url = | journal = International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 378–387 | doi=10.1179/oeh.2010.16.4.378| pmid = 21222382 | pmc = 4011082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nazarenko | first1 = Y. | last2 = Han | first2 = T.W. | last3 = Lioy | first3 = P.J. | last4 = Mainelis | first4 = G. | year = 2011 | title = Potential for exposure to engineered nanoparticles from nanotechnology-based consumer spray products | url = | journal = Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology | volume = 21 | issue = 5| pages = 515–528 | doi=10.1038/jes.2011.10 | pmid=21364702 | pmc=4027967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nazarenko | first1 = Y. | last2 = Lioy | first2 = P.J. | last3 = Mainelis | first3 = G. | year = 2014 | title = Quantitative assessment of inhalation exposure and deposited dose of aerosol from nanotechnology-based consumer sprays | journal = Environmental Science: Nano | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 161–171 | doi = 10.1039/c3en00053b | pmid=25621175 | pmc=4303255}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the exposure of athletes to artificial turf used on athletic fields. In addition,  from 1987 to 1991 he was the Chairman of the First [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC) Committee that directly addressed human exposure issues and published Human Exposure to Air Pollutants: Advances and Opportunities," also called "White Book.&lt;ref&gt;NRC. 1991. Human exposure assessment for airborne pollutants:  advances and opportunities. Washington, DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;" He was Vice Chair of the NRC committee on Exposure Science that produced the report entitled "Exposure Science in the 21st Century:  A Vision and A Strategy".&lt;ref&gt;NRC. 2012. Exposure Science in the 21st Century:  A Vision and A Strategy. National Research Council. Washington, DC. http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13507&lt;/ref&gt; He was also vice chair of the WTC Technical Panel that was formed to address the issues of residential cleanup during the WTC Aftermath.

===Ozone===
During the early 1980s Lioy recognized that the public health metric for defining exposure of the general population to troposphere [[ozone]] (smog) was incorrect and that the one-hour standard for peak ozone levels should be replaced by an eight-hour standard. Independently, Peter Rombout, [[RIVM]], Netherlands, discovered the same issue. In 1986, they collaborated and published an article on the need for an eight-hour ozone standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rombout | first1 = P | last2 = Lioy | first2 = PJ | last3 = Goldstein | first3 = BD | year = 1986 | title = Rationale for an eight hour ozone standard | url = | journal = Journal of the Air Pollution Control Association | volume = 36 | issue = 8| pages = 913–916 | doi=10.1080/00022470.1986.10466130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lioy's group also conducted research on the relationship between ozone exposure and visits to emergency rooms during the summertime. In 2002, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) published an eight-hour [[NAAQS]] ozone standard based upon the scientific exposure–response evidence from multiple laboratories that exposures to asthmatics and others to eight hours of ozone above 0.80 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register, 68 FR 32802, June 3, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  This standard for protection of public health was tightened to 0.75 ppm but remains as an 8-hour contact with the air pollutant, and is in final review for a further tightening of the 8-hour standard.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register, 73 FR 16436, March 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semivolatile chemical exposures in the home===
In the 1990s Lioy’s laboratory became increasingly focused on dust in the home as a potential metric of exposure to metals and organic compounds. Included was the concurrent scientific issue of the semi-volatility of the materials associated with dust particles. This led to studies that demonstrated that semi-volatile pesticides should not just be considered just residues after application, but as toxin that can be spread throughout the home based process of evaporation and absorption and adsorption. This process was described in an article Published in 1998, and focused on the accumulation of pesticides in children’s toys,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gurunathan | first1 = S | last2 = Robson | first2 = M | last3 = Freeman | first3 = N | last4 = Buckley | first4 = B | last5 = Roy | first5 = A | last6 = Meyer | first6 = R | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 1998 | title = Accumulation of chlorpyrifos on residential surfaces and toys accessible to children | url = | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 106 | issue = 1| pages = 9–16 | doi=10.1289/ehp.981069| pmid = 9417768 | pmc = 1532945 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ways to protect toys were summarized in popular magazines and web sites. The work was used in revisions of the EPA standards for use of the pesticide [[chlorpyrifos]] indoors. The complex issues of dust and semi-volatile toxins in homes were published in 2002 and 2006 review articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Freeman | first2 = NC | last3 = Millette | first3 = JR | year = 2002 | title = Dust: a metric for use in residential and building exposure assessment and source characterization | url = | journal = Environ Health Perspect | volume = 110 | issue = 10| pages = 969–983 | doi=10.1289/ehp.02110969| pmid = 12361921 | pmc = 1241022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;15.

''Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology'' 16(3):207-224.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally he expanded this work to encompass releases and deposition of many chemicals in carpets and other plush surfaces.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

===Chromium wastes===
During the late 1980s the state of NJ discovered that wastes from the refining and production of the chrome plated products had been used as apparent Clean fill in various residential settings, and was also had contaminated a number other industrial locations.Lioy conducted a comprehensive study of chromium wastes in Jersey City, including residential exposures and the bioavailability and size distribution if the wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Freeman | first2 = NCG | last3 = Wainman | first3 = T | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 1992 | title = Microenvironmental analysis of residential exposure to chromium-laden wastes in and around New-Jersey homes | url = | journal = Risk Analysis | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 287–299 | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1992.tb00676.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kitsa | first1 = V | last2 = Lioy | first2 = PJ | last3 = Chow | first3 = JC | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 1992 | title = Particle-Size Distribution of Chromium: Total and Hexavalent Chromium in Inspirable, Thoracic, and Respirable Soil Particles from Contaminated Sites in New Jersey | url = | journal = Aerosol Science and Technology | volume = 17 | issue = 3| pages = 213–229 | doi=10.1080/02786829208959572}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work found that similar to current lead problems, the chromium exposures indoors were highly related to the levels found in house dust and not ambient air. In addition the use of dust laden corium as a marker of exposure was extremely valuable in conclusively defining that the removal of the wastes in the residential neighborhoods brought the levels of chromium down to background by the end of 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freeman | first1 = NC | last2 = Lioy | first2 = PJ | last3 = Stern | first3 = AH | year = 2000 | title = Reduction in residential chromium following site remediation | url = | journal = Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association | volume = 50 | issue = 6| pages = 948–953 | doi=10.1080/10473289.2000.10464132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts are continuing in Jersey City and are now using analytical methods perfected at EOHSI to measure the levels of the hexavalent chromium (carcinogenic form) in human blood and in the areas around remaining industrial sites, that are beginning to receive final remediation. Acomprehensive review paper on this work was published by Stern, Gochfeld and Lioy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stern | first1 = A.H. | last2 = Gochfeld | first2 = M. | last3 = Lioy | first3 = P.J. | year = 2013 | title = Two decades of exposure assessment studies on chromate production waste in Jersey City, New Jersey--what we have learned about exposure characterization and its value to public health and remediation | url = | journal = J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 2–12 | doi=10.1038/jes.2012.100| pmid = 23131713 | pmc = 4286875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Trade Center dust===
In the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] (WTC), Lioy was able to see the dust plumes from his home in [[Cranford, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; The major environmental and occupational health related issue during the aftermath of the building collapses was the size range and composition of the dust and smoke that was released during the first hours to days post collapse of the twin towers, and subsequently the dust that had deposited indoors and required cleanup. In collaboration with multiple laboratories, Lioy examined the composition and size distribution of the WTC dust in detail for [[inorganic]], [[Organic compound|organic]] and [[Ionic compound|ionic]] species. The results were published in a 2002 article entitled ''Characterization of the dust/smoke aerosol that settled east of the WTC in lower Manhattan after the collapse of the WTC September 11, 2001'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Weisel | first2 = CP | last3 = Millette | first3 = JR | last4 = Eisenreich | first4 = S | last5 = Vallero | first5 = D | last6 = Offenberg | first6 = J | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 2002 | title = Characterization of the dust/smoke aerosol that settled east of the WTC in lower Manhattan after the collapse of the WTC 11 September 2001 | url = | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 110 | issue = 7| pages = 703–714 | doi=10.1289/ehp.02110703| pmid = 12117648 | pmc = 1240917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been used to understand the cause of the WTC cough and other health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prezant | first1 = DJ | last2 = Weiden | first2 = M | last3 = Banauch | first3 = GI | last4 = McGuinness | first4 = G | last5 = Rom | first5 = WN | last6 = Aldrich | first6 = TK | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 2002 | title = Cough and bronchial responsiveness in firefighters at the WTC site | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 347 | issue = 11| pages = 806–815 | doi=10.1056/nejmoa021300 | pmid=12226151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other work that Lioy and colleagues published through 2009, they described the time line of exposure to the local population and workers from the moments after the collapse through December 2001, and pointed out the many lessons that can be learned from the WTC in order to effectively respond to other disasters.&lt;ref name="Lioy PJ 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lioy | first1 = PJ | last2 = Georgopoulos | first2 = P | year = 2006 | title = The anatomy of the exposures that occurred around the World Trade Center site: 9/11 and beyond | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1076 | issue = | pages = 54–79 | doi=10.1196/annals.1371.002 | pmid=17119193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of his death, he was working with Dr. [[Philip J. Landrigan]] et al. of [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] on the long-term health effects experienced by WTC workers. During the aftermath Lioy was interviewed many times by the Media on WTC Dust related issues from October 2001 through 2011&lt;ref&gt;(See, e.g. [http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/2011/sep/08/dust/ Decade 9/11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005160802/http://www.wnyc.org/shows/lopate/2011/sep/08/dust/ |date=2012-10-05 }} and [http://beta.wnyc.org/people/paul-lioy/ Please Explain: Dust] - interviews with [[Leonard Lopate]] on [[National Public Radio]]; [http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/07/dr-sanjay-gupta-reports-terror-in-the-dust-debuts-wednesday-sept-7/ Terror in the Dust] - a documentary with [[Dr. Sanjay Gupta]] on [[CNN]]; and [http://blog.national911memorial.org/?p=4475 The Memo Blog: Exploring 9/11 - The World Before and After - Exploring Health Effects of WTC Dust])&lt;/ref&gt; The work of Lioy and his colleagues is mentioned in a book by Anthony Depalma entitled ''City of Dust: Illness, Arrogance, and 9/11''.&lt;ref&gt;DePalma A. (2010). City of Dust: Illness, Arrogance, and 9/11. Upper Saddle River, NJ, FT Press&lt;/ref&gt; Lioy published a book on the WTC dust and his experiences entitled ''Dust: the Inside Story of its Role in the September 11th Aftermath'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Lioy, P.J. 2010. Dust: The Inside Story of its Role in the September 11th Aftermath: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he received an Ellen Hardin Walworth National Patriotism Medal from the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] for his work on the World Trade Center aftermath.

'''Primary Care Service Areas''' are geographic areas that are self-sufficient markets of [[primary care]]. These areas are designed in a manner such that the majority of patients living in these areas use primary care services form within the area. This ensures that any [[geographic targeting]] of policies and resources reach the patients they are meant for. These geographies have been created in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mazumdar | first1 = S. | last2 = Feng| first2 = X. | last3 = Konings| first3 = P. | last4 = McRae | first4 = I. | last5 = Girosi | first5 = F. |year = 2014 | title = A brief report on Primary Care Service Area catchment geographies in New South Wales Australia.| url = https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-072X-13-38| journal = International Journal of Health Geographics| volume = 13 | issue =38 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1186/1476-072X-13-38}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = D. | last2 = Mick| first2 = S. | last3 = Bott | first3 = D. | last4 = Stukel | first4 = T. | last5 = Chang | first5 = CH. | last6 = Marth | first6 = N. | last7 = Boag | first7 = J. | last8 = Carretta | first8 = HJ. |year = 2003 | title = Primary care service areas: a new tool for the evaluation of primary care services.| pmid = 12650392 | journal = Health Serv Res| volume = 38 | issue =1 | pages = 287–309 | doi = 10.1111/1475-6773.00116 | pmc=1360885}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Switzerland &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Busato | first1 = A. | last2 = Kunzi| first2 = B.|year = 2008 | title = Primary care physician supply and other key determinants of health care utilisation: the case of Switzerland.| url = http://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6963-8-8 | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 8 | issue =1 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-8-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using [[big data]] and [[Geographic information systems]]. In Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mazumdar | first1 = S. | last2 = Feng| first2 = X. | last3 = Konings| first3 = P. | last4 = McRae | first4 = I. | last5 = Girosi | first5 = F. |year = 2014 | title = A brief report on Primary Care Service Area catchment geographies in New South Wales Australia.| url = https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-072X-13-38| journal = International Journal of Health Geographics| volume = 13 | issue =38 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1186/1476-072X-13-38}}&lt;/ref&gt; while they have been developed for the state of New South Wales, they have not found application among policymakers, where, as of 2016 much larger geographies called Primary Health Networks are used for primary care management. However, they have found an especially wide audience amongst policymakers and researchers in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = D. | last2 = Mick| first2 = S. | last3 = Bott | first3 = D. | last4 = Stukel | first4 = T. | last5 = Chang | first5 = CH. | last6 = Marth | first6 = N. | last7 = Boag | first7 = J. | last8 = Carretta | first8 = HJ. |year = 2003 | title = Primary care service areas: a new tool for the evaluation of primary care services.| pmid = 12650392 | journal = Health Serv Res| volume = 38 | issue =1 | pages = 287–309 | doi = 10.1111/1475-6773.00116 | pmc=1360885}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where they were first developed. Thus for example the Health Resources and Services Administration uses them to designate areas of workforce shortage. Primary Care Service Areas are thus for example an appropriate geography for measuring  primary care [[physician supply]] or geographic access to [[General practitioners]].

&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'''Process performance qualification protocol''' is a component of [[process validation]]: [[process qualification]]. This step is vital in maintaining ongoing production quality by recording and having available for review essential conditions, &lt;u&gt;controls, testing, and expected manufacturing outcome&lt;/u&gt; of a production process. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] recommends the following criteria be included in a PPQ protocol:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance for Industry Process Validation: General Principles and Practices|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/UCM070336.pdf|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Manufacturing conditions: Operating parameters, equipment limits, and component inputs
*What data should be recorded and analyzed
*What tests should be performed to ensure quality at each production step
*A sampling plan to outline sampling methods both during and between production batches
*Analysis methodology that allows for data scientific and risk oriented decision making based on statistical data. Variability limits should be defined and contingencies in the event of non-conforming data established
*Approval of PPQ protocol from relevant departments
Deviations from the standard operation procedures should be made within the framework of the protocol and at the approval of relevant [[quality control]] departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Process Performance Qualification|url=http://www.atris-systems.com/222.0.html|publisher=Atris Information Systems|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol should cover all aspects of production including: equipment, personnel, raw materials, and operating environment. The FDA further recommends a documentation of the protocol be published internally. The report should include:
*A summation of relevant data and analysis from the protocol
*An explanation of unexpected data and any other results not mandated by the protocol and its effects on production quality
*Identify correlating effects and suggest changes to existing processes
*Conclude if the process performance is adequately qualified to meet performance standards. Should production standards not be met appropriate changes should be outlined

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3029">'''RIMPUFF''' is a local-scale puff diffusion model developed by Risø DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy, Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.risoe.dtu.dk|title=Danmarks Tekniske Universitet|work=dtu.dk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311010721/http://www.risoe.dtu.dk/|archivedate=2008-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an emergency response model to help emergency management organisations deal with chemical, nuclear, biological and radiological releases to the atmosphere.

RIMPUFF is in operational use in several European national emergency centres for preparedness and prediction of nuclear accidental releases (RODOS, EURANOS, [[ARGOS DSS|ARGOS]]), chemical gas releases ([[ARGOS DSS|ARGOS]]), and for airborne Foot-and Mouth Disease virus spread &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/ The Foot and Mouth Disease] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121154728/http://www.defra.gov.uk/footandmouth/ |date=2007-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

RIMPUFF builds from parameterized formulas for puff diffusion, wet and dry deposition, and gamma dose radiation. Its range of application covers distances up to ~1000&amp;nbsp;km from the point of release.

RIMPUFF calculates the instantaneous atmospheric dispersion taking into account the local wind variability and the local turbulence levels. The puff sizes represent instantaneous relative diffusion (no averaging) and is calculated from similarity scaling theory.
Puff diffusion is patameterized for travel times in the range from a few seconds and up to ~1 day.

Wet and dry deposition is also calculated as a function of local rain intensity and turbulence levels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15503">'''Red Hill''' is an archaeological term for a small mound with a reddish colour found in the coastal and tidal river areas of [[East Anglia]] and [[Essex]]. Red Hills are formed as a result of generations of salt making, deriving their colour from the rubble of clay structures used in the salt-making process that have been scorched red by fires used to evaporate [[sea water]] to make salt cakes.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DR Wilson, ''Air Photo Interpretation'' (Tempus, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; They date from the [[Bronze Age Britain|Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age Britain|Iron Age]] and into the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]].&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

G. Hoskins|Hoskins]].&lt;ref&gt;WG Hoskins, ''Fieldwork in Local History'', (Faber &amp; Faber Ltd. 1967, pp. 154-158)&lt;/ref&gt; During these investigations much information was gathered both on the date and purpose of the Red Hills.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

==Description and purpose==

===Description===

Over 300 Red Hills have been identified so far, mostly along the Essex and [[Norfolk]] coasts, with others in [[Suffolk]] and [[Kent]].&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; The vast majority of Red Hills are located on low-lying coastal flats in [[Tidal estuary|tidal estuaries]] and in back-waters like Hamford Water between Harwich and [[Walton-on-the-Naze]] in Essex.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; They take the form of low mounds, ranging in size from about 200 square metres (equivalent to a 16m diameter circle) to a hectare (equiv. to a 115m diameter circle).&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; William Stopes identified one on Mersea Island near the Strood Channel which was 30 acres in size, but acknowledged that it may have consisted of more than one mound.&lt;ref name="Stopes 1979"/&gt; The height of many mounds has been much truncated by ploughing, with others located close to rivers and the sea either being eroded away or covered with [[Alluvium|alluvial silt]],&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; but an average sized mound at Peldon in Essex, 0.2 acres in size, still stands at a height of roughly 1.3m (meaning a volume of about 1000 cu metres, equivalent to 1500 tons of earth).&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; The strata of the mounds is made up of tips of [[briquetage]] (broken fragments of fired clay from hearths, evaporation pans and other salt-making furniture which give the mound its red colouration), ash, charcoal and unfired clay.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lesley &amp; Roy Adkins, ''The Handbook of British Archeology''&lt;/ref&gt; Most have large pits cut into the ground around them that have been lined with clay to produce a water-tight tank.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

===Features===

Several structures relating to salt production are found at Red Hills, whose purpose in the process is inferred from archaeological analysis and from analogies to Medieval and more recent techniques for obtaining sea salt.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

====Settling Tanks====

Rows of oval clay-lined pits dug into the alluvium around the Red Hills are interpreted as tanks for holding sea water.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; These tanks are usually in groups, with those found at Red Hills at Goldhanger,&lt;ref name="Brisay 1978"&gt;de Brisay, K.W. (1978) ‘The Excavations of a Red Hill at Peldon, Essex, with notes on some other sites’ Antiquities Journal LVIII pt.1&lt;/ref&gt; Maldon,&lt;ref name="Reader 1908"/&gt; and at Leigh Beck at Canvey Island&lt;ref name="Brisay 1972"&gt;de Brisay, K.W. (1972) Preliminary Report on the Exploration of the Red Hill at Osea Road, Maldon, Essex. Published by Colchester Archaeological Group Annual Bulletin 15&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of groups of three. Most tanks are between 1 and 2m in diameter, and around 1m deep, with a potential holding capacity of over 1000 litres.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

====Hearths====

''In situ'' hearths are relatively rare at Red Hill sites.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Parts of hearth substructures were found at the Red Hills on Osea Road near Maldon&lt;ref name="Brisay 1972"/&gt; and at [[Tollesbury]] in Essex,&lt;ref&gt;de Brisay, K.W. (1978) ‘A Red Hill at Tollesbury, Essex: Its background and excavation. Report on the First Year’  Published in Colchester Archaeological Group Bulletin 21&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the first identifiable hearth was found at Peldon close to the central settling tank in a group of three.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; This consisted of a subrectangular 1.8m x 0.8m clay walled structure, surviving to 0.4m high, with evidence of multiple firings.&lt;ref name="Brisay 1978"/&gt; Other hearths containing [[Imbrex and tegula|Roman tile]] have been found at Leigh Beck on Canvey Island, and others have been located at Red Hills along Fenn Creek near [[South Woodham Ferrers]].&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

====Flues====

Flue ducts for directing hot gas from fires to heat chambers have been found at some sites, but are very rare.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; At the ''Goldhanger VIII'' Red Hill nine flues and two ''fire-floors'' on top of the Red Hill mound,&lt;ref name="Reader 1910"/&gt; suggesting that they post-date most of the activity on the site.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

====Briquetage====

''[[Briquetage]]'' refers to the broken fragments of clay structures found in great quantities at Red Hill sites.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Much of this material is locally made and of a crude quality, suggesting that it was expedient.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Although some of the clay appears to have been fired in a kiln, much of it is bonfire-made.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; The redness of the material is created during its use, as the iron oxide content of the clay is [[Redox reaction|converted]] to red iron ferric oxide in an atmosphere containing a surplus of oxygen.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Some briquetage has lost its red colouration during its use as part of the salt evaporation furniture, turning grey, purple or brown.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; 90 per cent of briquetage consists of flat faced rectangular slabs of varying sizes, which can be reconstructed into large, rectangular clay vessels and trays.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Some examples from Langenhoe and Peldon have decorated rims.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Other examples of briquetage include pedestals and ''T-shapes'', believed to have held the rectangular clay vessels above fires,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; triangular ''fire-bars'' 20–40&amp;nbsp;cm in size that may suspended vessels above fires,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; triangular or plectrum-shaped wedges and long clay rods of unknown purposes,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; and ''pinch-props'', small lumps of briquetage that have a flat base and at least one other facet, possibly used to mend clay vessels.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

===Purpose===

The interpretation of these features as salt-making sites comes from the discovery of these features and artefacts associated with them. The briquetage and signs of burning at all Red Hills are taken as evidence that intensive use of fires took place on the sites.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Red Hills are found in close proximity to sources of salt water,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; and since Red Hills have clay-lined tanks for holding liquids associated with them, this is seen as an important fluid used in the activities which took place at the mounds.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; The charcoal, red-scorching, and fired clay briquetage is seen as evidence that fires and heating took place at the mounds,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; and so, since some of the briquetage has traces of green-glaze on its surfaces caused by the vitrification of clay with salt acting as a [[Ceramic flux|fluxing agent]],&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; the suggestion that [[saline water|salt water]], stored in the water-tight tanks, was being heated in clay trays to obtain salt as the end product is seen as the most likely purpose of the Red Hills.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Other industrial activities such as pottery making and metal working are seen as less likely due to the lack of any supporting evidence for such processes.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

==Function==

Red Hills are located on low-lying land close to marshes, estuaries and tidal bays,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; with rivers such as the Crouch and [[River Roach|Roach]], which have low [[freshwater]] outflows, having Red Hills far inland along their tidal estuaries.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;  Use of the Red Hill sites is believed to have been seasonal, with activity occurring from Spring until the end of Summer.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; The drier conditions of Spring allow for the construction of the clay structures for the season (which if constructed in damp conditions would have cracked when fired), and the collection of fire-wood.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Analysis of the charred remains of fire-wood from Red Hills sites suggests that [[coppicing|coppiced wood]] was used in the fires at the site, an activity that in itself required careful management over time.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

Sea-water may have been collected in tidally-fed [[Solar pond|sun pans]] cut into tidal channels to allow for solar evaporation in the initial stages of the process, although no such features have been positively identified.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Instead, sea water seems to have been collected in the clay-lined settling tanks, which were submerged by the high-tide or were filled manually when the tide was lower.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; The depth of these tanks suggests that they were designed to allow the alluvial mud and other unwanted solids in the water to settle to the bottom, to be emptied out later.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; As this settling procedure could take several hours, having more than one tank allowed for them to be at different stages of the settling process, meaning that salt making could continue with little down-time.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

Sea-water contains around 3.5 per cent solids on average, 2.7 per cent being salt,&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; with 96.5ccs of sea-water having  to be evaporated in order to obtain 2.7&amp;nbsp;g of salt.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; This would have been done by transferring water from the tanks to large rectangular trays suspended over fires that would have evaporated off the water.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; For the first batch of water the tray would have been filled before the fire was lit, to reduce the risk of cracking, after which water would have been constantly added from the tanks whilst salt crystals would have been constantly ladled out.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; [[Lime scale|Lime]] and [[gypsum]] hard-scale would form first, as pan-scale at the base of the trays.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Then, as the salt content in the trays rose from 2.7 per cent to 28 it would start to form crystals in the boiling water (meaning that 90ccs out of an original 100ccs of water would have needed to evaporate before salt crystals form).&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; Removing crystals before all of the water had evaporated from the tray was the intention, as it meant that impurities would have been left in the tray and the process could be continued all day without having to close the evaporation process down whilst salt was collected.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; In theory the tray vessel could have been topped up with water roughly one hundred times before the concentration of the [[Bittern (salt)|bittern]] impurities and pan-scale left behind became too high.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; The salt crystals ladled out of the trays would have been placed in drying vessels and baskets close to a source of heat.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt; From this "salt cakes" would be created, ready for transportation.&lt;ref name="Fawn 1990"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5162">In [[solid state physics]] the '''Ridley–Watkins–Hilsum theory''' ('''RWH''') explains the mechanism by which differential [[negative resistance]] is developed in a bulk solid state [[semiconductor]] material when a voltage is applied to the terminals of the sample.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the theory behind the operation of the [[Gunn diode]] as well as several other microwave semiconductor devices, which are used practically in [[electronic oscillator]]s to produce [[microwave]] power.  It is named for British physicists [[Brian Ridley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ridley|first1=Brian|title=B. K.

Negative resistance oscillations in bulk semiconductors had been observed in the laboratory by [[J. B. Gunn]] in 1962,&lt;ref name=gunn_effect&gt;

In essence, RWH mechanism is the transfer of conduction electrons in a semiconductor from a high [[Electron mobility|mobility]] valley to lower-mobility, higher-energy satellite valleys. This phenomenon can only be observed in materials that have such [[energy band]] structures.

Normally, in a conductor, increasing [[electric field]] causes higher charge [[Charge carrier|carrier]] (usually electron) speeds and results in higher current consistent with [[Ohm's Law]]. In a multi-valley semiconductor, though, higher energy may push the carriers into a higher energy state where they actually have higher [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] and thus slow down. In effect, carrier velocities and current drop as the voltage is increased. While this transfer occurs, the material exhibits a decrease in current – that is, a negative differential resistance.  At higher voltages, the normal increase of current with voltage relation resumes once the bulk of the carriers are kicked into the higher energy-mass valley.  Therefore the negative resistance only occurs over a limited range of voltages.

Of the type of semiconducting materials satisfying these conditions, [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) is the most widely understood and used. However RWH mechanisms can also be observed in [[indium phosphide]] (InP), [[cadmium telluride]] (CdTe), [[zinc selenide]] (ZnSe) and [[indium arsenide]] (InAs) under hydrostatic or uniaxial pressure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48269">In [[computer science]], a '''rough set''', first described by [[Poles|Polish]] computer scientist [[Zdzislaw Pawlak|Zdzisław I. Pawlak]], is a formal approximation of a [[crisp set]] (i.e., conventional set) in terms of a pair of sets which give the ''lower'' and the ''upper'' approximation of the original set. In the standard version of rough set theory (Pawlak 1991), the lower- and upper-approximation sets are crisp sets, but in other variations, the approximating sets may be [[fuzzy sets]].

==Definitions==
The following section contains an overview of the basic framework of rough set theory, as originally proposed by [[Zdzislaw Pawlak|Zdzisław I. Pawlak]], along with some of the key definitions. More formal properties and boundaries of rough sets can be found in Pawlak (1991) and cited references. The initial and basic theory of rough sets is sometimes referred to as ''"Pawlak Rough Sets"'' or ''"classical rough sets"'', as a means to distinguish from more recent extensions and generalizations.

===Information system framework===
Let &lt;math&gt;I = (\mathbb{U},\mathbb{A})&lt;/math&gt; be an information system ([[attribute-value system]]), where &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty, finite set of objects (the universe) and &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty, finite set of attributes such that &lt;math&gt;a:\mathbb{U} \rightarrow V_a&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; is the set of values that attribute &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; may take. The information table assigns a value &lt;math&gt;a(x)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; to each attribute &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and object &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the universe &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt;.

With any &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq \mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; there is an associated [[equivalence relation]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IND}(P)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathrm{IND}(P) = \left\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{U}^2 \mid \forall a \in P, a(x)=a(y)\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

The relation &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IND}(P)&lt;/math&gt; is called a &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;''-indiscernibility relation''. The partition of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; is a family of all equivalence classes of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IND}(P)&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted  by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}/\mathrm{IND}(P)&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}/P&lt;/math&gt;).

If &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in \mathrm{IND}(P)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are ''indiscernible'' (or indistinguishable) by attributes from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; .

The equivalence classes of the &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-indiscernibility relation are denoted &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example: equivalence-class structure===
For example, consider the following information table:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:30%" border="1"
|+ Sample Information System
! Object !! &lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{2}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{3}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{1}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{2}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{4}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{6}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{7}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{8}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{9}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{10}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|}

When the full set of attributes &lt;math&gt;P = \{P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4},P_{5}\}&lt;/math&gt; is considered, we see that we have the following seven equivalence classes:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4}\} \\ 
\{O_{5}\} \\
\{O_{6}\} \\
\{O_{8}\} \\
\{O_{9}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the two objects within the first equivalence class, &lt;math&gt;\{O_{1},O_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt;, cannot be distinguished from each other based on the available attributes, and the three objects within the second equivalence class, &lt;math&gt;\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, cannot be distinguished from one another based on the available attributes. The remaining five objects are each discernible from all other objects.

It is apparent that different attribute subset selections will in general lead to different indiscernibility classes. For example, if attribute &lt;math&gt;P =\{ P_{1}\}&lt;/math&gt; alone is selected, we obtain the following, much coarser, equivalence-class structure:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{5},O_{7},O_{9},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{6},O_{8}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Definition of a ''rough set''===
Let &lt;math&gt;X \subseteq \mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; be a target set that we wish to represent using attribute subset &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;; that is, we are told that an arbitrary set of objects &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; comprises a single class, and we wish to express this class (i.e., this subset) using the equivalence classes induced by attribute subset &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. In general, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; cannot be expressed exactly, because the set may include and exclude objects which are indistinguishable on the basis of attributes &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, consider the target set &lt;math&gt;X = \{O_{1},O_{2},O_{3},O_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and let attribute subset &lt;math&gt;P = \{P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}, P_{5}\}&lt;/math&gt;, the full available set of features.  It will be noted that the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; cannot be expressed exactly, because in &lt;math&gt;[x]_P,&lt;/math&gt;, objects &lt;math&gt;\{O_{3}, O_{7}, O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt; are indiscernible. Thus, there is no way to represent any set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which ''includes'' &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt; but ''excludes'' objects &lt;math&gt;O_{7}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_{10}&lt;/math&gt;.

However, the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be ''approximated'' using only the information contained within &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; by constructing the &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-lower and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-upper approximations of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
  {\underline P}X= \{x \mid [x]_P \subseteq X\}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  {\overline P}X = \{x \mid [x]_P \cap X \neq \emptyset \}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Lower approximation and positive region====
The &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;''-lower approximation'', or ''positive region'', is the union of all equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; which are contained by (i.e., are subsets of) the target set – in the example, &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}X = \{O_{1}, O_{2}\} \cup \{O_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt;, the union of the two equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; which are contained in the target set. The lower approximation is the complete set of objects in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}/P&lt;/math&gt; that can be ''positively'' (i.e., unambiguously) classified as belonging to target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

====Upper approximation and negative region====
The &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;''-upper approximation'' is the union of all equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; which have non-empty intersection with the target set – in the example, &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X = \{O_{1}, O_{2}\} \cup \{O_{4}\} \cup \{O_{3}, O_{7}, O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, the union of the three equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; that have non-empty intersection with the target set. The upper approximation is the complete set of objects that in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}/P&lt;/math&gt; that ''cannot'' be positively (i.e., unambiguously) classified as belonging to the ''complement'' (&lt;math&gt;\overline X&lt;/math&gt;) of the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the upper approximation is the complete set of objects that are ''possibly'' members of the  target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}-{\overline P}X&lt;/math&gt; therefore represents the ''negative region'', containing the set of objects that can be definitely ruled out as members of the target set.

====Boundary region====
The ''boundary region'', given by set difference &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X - {\underline P}X&lt;/math&gt;, consists of those objects that can neither be ruled in nor ruled out as members of the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

In summary, the lower approximation of a target set is a ''conservative'' approximation consisting of only those objects which can positively be identified as members of the set. (These objects have no indiscernible "clones" which are excluded by the target set.) The upper approximation is a ''liberal'' approximation which includes all objects that might be members of target set. (Some objects in the upper approximation may not be members of the target set.) From the perspective of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}/P&lt;/math&gt;, the lower approximation contains objects that are members of the target set with certainty (probability = 1), while the upper approximation contains objects that are members of the target set with non-zero probability (probability &gt; 0).

====The rough set====
The tuple &lt;math&gt;\langle{\underline P}X,{\overline P}X\rangle&lt;/math&gt; composed of the lower and upper approximation is called a ''rough set''; thus, a rough set is composed of two crisp sets, one representing a ''lower boundary'' of the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and the other representing an ''upper boundary'' of the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''accuracy'' of the rough-set representation of the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be given (Pawlak 1991) by the following:

:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{P}(X) = \frac{\left | {\underline P}X \right |} {\left | {\overline P}X \right |} 
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the accuracy of the rough set representation of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \alpha_{P}(X) \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, is the ratio of the number of objects which can ''positively'' be placed in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to the number of objects that can ''possibly'' be placed in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; – this provides a measure of how closely the rough set is approximating the target set. Clearly, when the upper and lower approximations are equal (i.e., boundary region empty), then &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{P}(X) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and the approximation is perfect; at the other extreme, whenever the lower approximation is empty, the accuracy is zero (regardless of the size of the upper approximation).

====Objective analysis====
Rough set theory is one of many methods that can be employed to analyse uncertain (including vague) systems, although less common than more traditional methods of [[probability]], [[statistics]], [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] and [[Dempster–Shafer theory]]. However a key difference, and a unique strength, of using classical rough set theory is that it provides an objective form of analysis (Pawlak et al. 1995). Unlike other methods, as those given above, classical rough set analysis requires no additional information, external parameters, models, functions, grades or subjective interpretations to determine set membership – instead it only uses the information presented within the given data (Düntsch and Gediga 1995).  More recent adaptations of rough set theory, such as dominance-based, decision-theoretic and fuzzy rough sets, have introduced more subjectivity to the analysis.

===Definability===
In general, the upper and lower approximations are not equal; in such cases, we say that target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''undefinable'' or ''roughly definable'' on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. When the upper and lower approximations are equal (i.e., the boundary is empty),  &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X = {\underline P}X&lt;/math&gt;, then the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''definable'' on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. We can distinguish the following special cases of undefinability:

* Set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''internally'' ''undefinable'' if &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}X = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X \neq \mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, there are ''no'' objects which we can be certain belong to target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, but there ''are'' objects which we can definitively exclude from set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
* Set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''externally undefinable'' if &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}X \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X = \mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, there ''are'' objects which we can be certain belong to target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, but there are ''no'' objects which we can definitively exclude from set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
* Set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''totally undefinable'' if &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}X = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X = \mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, there are ''no'' objects which we can be certain belong to target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and there are ''no'' objects which we can definitively exclude from set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, we cannot decide whether any object is, or is not, a member of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

===Reduct and core===
An interesting question is whether there are attributes in the information system (attribute-value table) which are more important to the knowledge represented in the equivalence class structure than other attributes.  Often, we wonder whether there is a subset of attributes which can, by itself, fully characterize the knowledge in the database; such an attribute set is called a ''reduct''.

Formally, a reduct is a subset of attributes &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RED} \subseteq P&lt;/math&gt; such that

* &lt;math&gt;[x]_{\mathrm{RED}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the equivalence classes induced by the reduced attribute set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RED}&lt;/math&gt; are the same as the equivalence class structure induced by the full attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.
* the attribute set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RED}&lt;/math&gt; is ''minimal'', in the sense that &lt;math&gt;[x]_{(\mathrm{RED}-\{a\})} \neq [x]_P&lt;/math&gt; for any attribute &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathrm{RED}&lt;/math&gt;; in other words, no attribute can be removed from set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RED}&lt;/math&gt; without changing the equivalence classes &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.

A reduct can be thought of as a ''sufficient'' set of features – sufficient, that is, to represent the category structure. In the example table above, attribute set &lt;math&gt;\{P_3,P_4,P_5\}&lt;/math&gt; is a reduct – the information system projected on just these attributes possesses the same equivalence class structure as that expressed by the full attribute set:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4}\} \\ 
\{O_{5}\} \\
\{O_{6}\} \\
\{O_{8}\} \\
\{O_{9}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Attribute set &lt;math&gt;\{P_3,P_4,P_5\}&lt;/math&gt; is a reduct because eliminating any of these attributes causes a collapse of the equivalence-class structure, with the result that &lt;math&gt;[x]_{\mathrm{RED}} \neq [x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.

The reduct of an information system is ''not unique'': there may be many subsets of attributes which preserve the equivalence-class structure (i.e., the knowledge) expressed in the information system.  In the example information system above, another reduct is &lt;math&gt;\{P_1,P_2,P_5\}&lt;/math&gt;, producing the same equivalence-class structure as &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.

The set of attributes which is common to all reducts is called the ''core'': the core is the set of attributes which is possessed by ''every'' reduct, and therefore consists of attributes which cannot be removed from the information system without causing collapse of the equivalence-class structure.  The core may be thought of as the set of ''necessary'' attributes – necessary, that is, for the category structure to be represented. In the example, the only such attribute is &lt;math&gt;\{P_5\}&lt;/math&gt;; any one of the other attributes can be removed singly without damaging the equivalence-class structure, and hence these are all ''dispensable''.  However, removing &lt;math&gt;\{P_5\}&lt;/math&gt; by itself ''does'' change the equivalence-class structure, and thus &lt;math&gt;\{P_5\}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''indispensable'' attribute of this information system, and hence the core.

It is possible for the core to be empty, which means that there is no indispensable attribute: any single attribute in such an information system can be deleted without altering the equivalence-class  structure. In such cases, there is no ''essential'' or necessary attribute which is required for the class structure to be represented.

===Attribute dependency===
One of the most important aspects of database analysis or data acquisition is the discovery of attribute dependencies; that is, we wish to discover which variables are strongly related to which other variables. Generally, it is these strong relationships that will warrant further investigation, and that will ultimately be of use in predictive modeling.

In rough set theory, the notion of dependency is defined very simply. Let us take two (disjoint) sets of attributes, set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, and inquire what degree of dependency obtains between them.  Each attribute set induces an (indiscernibility) equivalence class structure, the equivalence classes induced by &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;, and the equivalence classes induced by &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q = \{Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, \dots, Q_N \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; is a given equivalence class from the equivalence-class structure induced by attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, the ''dependency'' of attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q)&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_{P}(Q) =  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \left | {\underline P}Q_i \right |} {\left | \mathbb{U} \right |} \leq 1
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, for each equivalence class &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;, we add up the size of its lower approximation by the attributes in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}Q_i&lt;/math&gt;.  This approximation (as above, for arbitrary set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) is the number of objects which on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can be positively identified as belonging to target set &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt;. Added across all equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;, the numerator above represents the total number of objects which – based on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; – can be positively categorized according to the classification induced by attributes &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;. The dependency ratio therefore expresses the proportion (within the entire universe) of such classifiable objects.  The dependency &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q)&lt;/math&gt; "can be interpreted as a proportion of such objects in the information system for which it suffices to know the values of attributes in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to determine the values of attributes in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;".

Another, intuitive, way to consider dependency is to take the partition induced by Q as the target class C, and consider P as the attribute set we wish to use in order to "re-construct" the target class C. If P can completely reconstruct C, then Q depends totally upon P; if P results in a poor and perhaps a random reconstruction of C, then Q does not depend upon P at all.

Thus, this measure of dependency expresses the degree of ''functional'' (i.e., deterministic) dependency of attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;; it is ''not'' symmetric.  The relationship of this notion of attribute dependency to more traditional information-theoretic (i.e., entropic) notions of attribute dependence has been discussed in a number of sources (e.g., Pawlak, Wong, &amp; Ziarko 1988; Yao &amp; Yao 2002; Wong, Ziarko, &amp; Ye 1986, Quafafou &amp; Boussouf 2000).

==Rule extraction==
The category representations discussed above are all ''extensional'' in nature; that is, a category or complex class is simply the sum of all its members. To represent a category is, then, just to be able to list or identify all the objects belonging to that category.  However, extensional category representations have very limited practical use, because they provide no insight for deciding whether novel (never-before-seen) objects are members of the category.

What is generally desired is an ''intentional'' description of the category, a representation of the category based on a set of ''rules'' that describe the scope of the category.  The choice of such rules is not unique, and therein lies the issue of [[inductive bias]]. See [[Version space]] and [[Model selection]] for more about this issue.

There are a few rule-extraction methods.  We will start from a rule-extraction procedure based on Ziarko &amp; Shan (1995).

===Decision matrices===

Let us say that we wish to find the minimal set of consistent rules ([[logical implication]]s) that characterize our sample system.  For a set of ''condition'' attributes &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P} = \{P_1, P_2, P_3, \dots , P_n\}&lt;/math&gt; and a decision attribute &lt;math&gt;Q, Q \notin \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;, these rules should have the form &lt;math&gt;P_i^a P_j^b \dots P_k^c \to Q^d&lt;/math&gt;, or, spelled out,

:&lt;math&gt;(P_i=a) \land (P_j=b) \land \dots \land (P_k=c) \to (Q=d)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\{a, b, c, \dots\}&lt;/math&gt; are legitimate values from the domains of their respective attributes.  This is a form typical of [[association rules]], and the number of items in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; which match the condition/antecedent is called the ''support'' for the rule.  The method for extracting such rules given in {{Harvtxt|Ziarko|Shan|1995}} is to form a ''decision matrix'' corresponding to each individual value &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of decision attribute &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  Informally, the decision matrix for value &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of decision attribute &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; lists all attribute–value pairs that ''differ'' between objects having &lt;math&gt;Q = d &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q \ne d&lt;/math&gt;.

This is best explained by example (which also avoids a lot of notation).  Consider the table above, and let &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; be the decision variable (i.e., the variable on the right side of the implications) and let &lt;math&gt;\{P_1,P_2,P_3\}&lt;/math&gt; be the condition variables (on the left side of the implication). We note that the decision variable &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; takes on two different values, namely &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2\}&lt;/math&gt;.  We treat each case separately.

First, we look at the case &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt;, and we divide up &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; into objects that have &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; and those that have &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that objects with &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt; in this case are simply the objects that have &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=2&lt;/math&gt;, but in general, &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt; would include all objects having any value for &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; ''other than'' &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt;, and there may be several such classes of objects (for example, those having &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=2,3,4,etc.&lt;/math&gt;).)  In this case, the objects having &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\{O_1,O_2,O_3,O_7,O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt; while the objects which have &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\{O_4,O_5,O_6,O_8,O_9\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The decision matrix for &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; lists all the differences between the objects having &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; and those having &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;;  that is, the decision matrix lists all the differences between &lt;math&gt;\{O_1,O_2,O_3,O_7,O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{O_4,O_5,O_6,O_8,O_9\}&lt;/math&gt;.  We put the "positive" objects (&lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt;) as the rows, and the "negative" objects &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt; as the columns.

To read this decision matrix, look, for example, at the intersection of row &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt; and column &lt;math&gt;O_{6}&lt;/math&gt;, showing &lt;math&gt;P_1^2,P_3^0&lt;/math&gt; in the cell.  This means that ''with regard to'' decision value &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt;, object &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt; differs from object &lt;math&gt;O_{6}&lt;/math&gt; on attributes &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt;, and the particular values on these attributes for the positive object &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;P_1=2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_3=0&lt;/math&gt;. This tells us that the correct classification of &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt; as belonging to decision class &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; rests on attributes &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt;;  although one or the other might be dispensable, we know that ''at least one'' of these attributes is ''in''dispensable.

Next, from each decision matrix we form a set of [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] expressions, one expression for each row of the matrix. The items within each cell are aggregated disjunctively, and the individuals cells are then aggregated conjunctively. Thus, for the above table we have the following five Boolean expressions:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
(P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2) \\ 
(P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2) \\
(P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_2^0 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \\
(P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_2^0 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \\
(P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_2^0 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0)
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Each statement here is essentially a highly specific (probably ''too'' specific) rule governing the membership in class &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt;  of the corresponding object. For example, the last statement, corresponding to object &lt;math&gt;O_{10}&lt;/math&gt;, states that all the following must be satisfied: 
# Either &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; must have value 2, or  &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0, or both.
# &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0.
# Either &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; must have value 2, or  &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0, or both.
# Either &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; must have value 2, or &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0, or &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0, or any combination thereof.
# &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0.

It is clear that there is a large amount of redundancy here, and the next step is to simplify using traditional [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]].  The statement &lt;math&gt;(P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2)&lt;/math&gt;  corresponding to objects &lt;math&gt;\{O_{1},O_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt; simplifies to &lt;math&gt;P_1^1  \lor P_2^2&lt;/math&gt;, which yields the implication

:&lt;math&gt;(P_1=1)  \lor (P_2=2) \to (P_{4}=1)&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, the statement &lt;math&gt;(P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_2^0 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to objects &lt;math&gt;\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt; simplifies to &lt;math&gt;P_1^2 P_2^0 \lor P_3^0 P_2^0&lt;/math&gt;.  This gives us the implication

:&lt;math&gt;(P_1=2 \land P_2=0) \lor (P_3=0 \land P_2=0) \to (P_{4}=1)&lt;/math&gt;

The above implications can also be written as the following rule set:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
(P_1=1) \to (P_{4}=1) \\
(P_2=2) \to (P_{4}=1) \\
(P_1=2) \land (P_2=0) \to (P_{4}=1) \\
(P_3=0) \land (P_2=0) \to (P_{4}=1) 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

It can be noted that each of the first two rules has a ''support'' of 1 (i.e., the antecedent matches two objects), while each of the last two rules has a support of 2.  To finish writing the rule set for this knowledge system, the same procedure as above (starting with writing a new decision matrix) should be followed for the case of &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=2&lt;/math&gt;, thus yielding a new set of implications for that decision value (i.e., a set of implications with &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=2&lt;/math&gt; as the consequent). In general, the procedure will be repeated for each possible value of the decision variable.

===LERS rule induction system===

The data system LERS (Learning from Examples based on Rough Sets) Grzymala-Busse (1997) may induce rules from inconsistent data, i.e., data with conflicting objects.  Two objects are conflicting when they are characterized by the same values of all attributes, but they belong to different concepts (classes). LERS uses rough set theory to compute lower and upper approximations for concepts involved in conflicts with other concepts.

Rules induced from the lower approximation of the concept ''certainly'' describe the concept, hence such rules are called ''certain''.  On the other hand, rules induced from the upper approximation of the concept describe the concept ''possibly'', so these rules are called ''possible''.  For rule induction LERS uses three algorithms: LEM1, LEM2, and IRIM.

The LEM2 algorithm of LERS is frequently used for rule induction and is used not only in LERS but also in other systems, e.g., in RSES (Bazan et al. (2004).  LEM2 explores the search space of [[attribute-value pair]]s.  Its input data set is a lower or upper approximation of a concept, so its input data set is always consistent.  In general, LEM2 computes a local covering and then converts it into a rule set.  We will quote a few definitions to describe the LEM2 algorithm.

The LEM2 algorithm is based on an idea of an attribute-value pair block.  Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty lower or upper approximation of a concept represented by a decision-value pair &lt;math&gt;(d, w)&lt;/math&gt;.  Set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ''depends'' on a set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of attribute-value pairs &lt;math&gt;t = (a, v)&lt;/math&gt;  if and only if

: &lt;math&gt;\emptyset \neq [T] = \bigcap_{t \in T} [t] \subseteq X.&lt;/math&gt;

Set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a ''minimal complex'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and no proper subset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; exists such that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty collection of nonempty sets of attribute-value pairs.  Then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''local covering'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:

each member &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is a minimal complex of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;
\bigcup_{t \in \mathbb{T}} [T]  = X, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is minimal, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; has the smallest possible number of members.

For our sample information system, LEM2 will induce the following rules:

:&lt;math&gt;

&lt;/math&gt;

Other rule-learning methods can be found, e.g., in Pawlak (1991), Stefanowski (1998), Bazan et al. (2004), etc.

==Incomplete data==

Rough set theory is useful for rule induction from incomplete data sets. Using this approach we can distinguish between three types of missing attribute values: ''lost values'' (the values that were recorded but currently are unavailable), ''attribute-concept values'' (these missing attribute values may be replaced by any attribute value limited to the same concept), and ''"do not care" conditions''  (the original values were irrelevant).  A  ''concept'' (''class'') is a set of all objects classified (or diagnosed) the same way.

Two special data sets with missing attribute values were extensively studied: in the first case, all missing attribute values were lost (Stefanowski and Tsoukias, 2001), in the second case, all missing attribute values were "do not care" conditions (Kryszkiewicz, 1999).

In attribute-concept values interpretation of a missing attribute value, the missing attribute value may be replaced by any value of the attribute domain restricted to the concept to which the object with a missing attribute value belongs (Grzymala-Busse and Grzymala-Busse, 2007).  For example, if for a patient the value of an attribute Temperature is missing, this patient is sick with flu, and all remaining patients sick with flu have values high or very-high for  Temperature when using the interpretation of the missing attribute value as the  attribute-concept value, we will replace the missing attribute value with  high and very-high.  Additionally, the ''characteristic relation'', (see, e.g., Grzymala-Busse and Grzymala-Busse, 2007) enables to process data sets with all three kind of missing attribute values at the same time: lost, "do not care" conditions, and attribute-concept values.

==Applications==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}

Rough set methods can be applied as a component of hybrid solutions in [[machine learning]] and [[data mining]]. They have been found to be particularly useful for [[rule induction]] and [[feature selection]] (semantics-preserving dimensionality reduction). Rough set-based data analysis methods have been successfully applied in bioinformatics, economics and finance, medicine, multimedia, web and text mining, signal and image processing, software engineering, robotics, and engineering (e.g. power systems and control engineering). Recently the three regions of rough sets are interpreted as regions of acceptance, rejection and deferment. This leads to three-way decision making approach with the model which can potentially lead to interesting future applications.

==History==

The idea of rough set was proposed by [[Zdzisław Pawlak|Pawlak]] (1981) as a new mathematical tool to deal with vague concepts. Comer, Grzymala-Busse, Iwinski, Nieminen, Novotny, Pawlak, Obtulowicz, and Pomykala have studied algebraic properties of rough sets. Different algebraic semantics have been developed by P. Pagliani, I. Duntsch, M. K. Chakraborty, M. Banerjee and A. Mani; these have been extended to more generalized rough sets by D. Cattaneo and A. Mani, in particular. Rough sets can be used to represent [[ambiguity]], [[vagueness]] and general [[uncertainty]].

==Extensions and generalizations==

Since the development of rough sets, extensions and generalizations have continued to evolve. Initial developments focused on the relationship - both similarities and difference - with [[fuzzy sets]]. While some literature contends these concepts are different, other literature considers that rough sets are a generalization of fuzzy sets - as represented through either fuzzy rough sets or rough fuzzy sets.  Pawlak (1995) considered that fuzzy and rough sets should be treated as being complementary to each other, addressing different aspects of uncertainty and vagueness.

Three notable extensions of classical rough sets are:
* [[Dominance-based rough set approach]] (DRSA) is an extension of rough set theory for [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] (MCDA), introduced by Greco, Matarazzo and Słowiński (2001). The main change in this extension of classical rough sets is the substitution of the indiscernibility relation by a ''dominance'' relation, which permits the formalism to deal with inconsistencies typical in consideration of criteria  and preference-ordered decision classes.
* [[Decision-theoretic rough sets]] (DTRS) is a probabilistic extension of rough set theory introduced by Yao, Wong, and Lingras (1990).  It utilizes a Bayesian decision procedure for minimum risk decision making.  Elements are included into the lower and upper approximations based on whether their conditional probability is above thresholds &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt;.  These upper and lower thresholds determine region inclusion for elements.  This model is unique and powerful since the thresholds themselves are calculated from a set of six loss functions representing classification risks.
* [[Game-theoretic rough sets]] (GTRS) is a game theory-based extension of rough set that was introduced by Herbert and Yao (2011). It utilizes a game-theoretic environment to optimize certain criteria of rough sets based classification or decision making in order to obtain effective region sizes.

===Rough membership===

Rough sets can be also defined, as a generalisation, by employing a rough membership function instead of objective approximation. The rough membership function expresses a conditional probability that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; belongs to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \R&lt;/math&gt;. This can be interpreted as a degree that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; belongs to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in terms of information about &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; expressed by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \R&lt;/math&gt;.

Rough membership primarily differs from the fuzzy membership in that the membership of union and intersection of sets cannot, in general, be computed from their constituent membership as is the case of fuzzy sets. In this, rough membership is a generalization of fuzzy membership. Furthermore, the rough membership function is grounded more in probability than the conventionally held concepts of the fuzzy membership function.

===Other generalizations===
Several generalizations of rough sets have been introduced, studied and applied to solving problems. Here are some of these generalizations:

*rough multisets (Grzymala-Busse, 1987)
*fuzzy rough sets extend the rough set concept through the use of fuzzy equivalence classes(Nakamura, 1988)
*Alpha rough set theory (α-RST) - a generalization of rough set theory that allows approximation using of fuzzy concepts (Quafafou, 2000)
*intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets (Cornelis, De Cock and Kerre, 2003)
*generalized rough fuzzy sets (Feng, 2010)
*rough intuitionistic fuzzy sets (Thomas and Nair, 2011)
*soft rough fuzzy sets and soft fuzzy rough sets (Meng, Zhang and Qin, 2011)
*composite rough sets (Zhang, Li and Chen, 2014)

The '''Seuso Treasure''' or '''Sevso Treasure''' ({{lang-hu|Seuso-kincsek}}; {{lang-hr|Seusovo blago}}), is a [[hoard]] of [[silver]] objects (14 items) from the late [[Roman Empire]]. The first pieces appeared on the market in [[London]] in 1980, and the treasure was acquired by a consortium headed by [[Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton]]. Documentation was provided in which it was stated that it had been found in the Tyre and Sidon regions of [[Lebanon]]. It was put up for sale in [[New York City]] in 1990 by [[Sotheby's]], but was halted when the documentation was found to be false, and the governments of [[Hungary]], [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Lebanon]] made claims of ownership. The claims of ownership by these countries were rejected by a US court, and the treasure remained in the possession of the Marquess of Northampton. [[Scotland Yard]] still has an open case on the matter.

The origin and [[provenance]] of the treasure are likely known, but not publicly acknowledged. There is much scientific evidence to indicate that the hoard was first acquired in the 1970s after the murder of a Hungarian soldier, who discovered the treasure during illicit digging at an established archaeological site in Hungary.&lt;ref name="Time Team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/time-team-specials/episode-guide/series-119/episode-3 |title=Time Team Specials – The Mystery of the Roman Treasure – Channel 4 |publisher=channel4.com|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March 2014 [[Prime Minister of Hungary]] [[Viktor Orbán]] announced that half of the Seuso Treasure (seven items) had been bought by Hungary.&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20140326_Orban_Magyarorszag_visszaszerezte_a_Seuso#rss |title=Orbán: Magyarország visszaszerezte a Seuso-kincset |publisher=hvg.hu |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/2014/03/26/3101774/hungary-buys-back-7-roman-era.html?sp=/99/109/ |title=Hungary buys back 7 Roman-era silver trays, jugs|publisher=idahostatesman.com |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister described it as "Hungary's family silverware".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbj.hu/budapest/sevso-treasure-hungarys-family-silverware-returned_77609 |title=Sevso Treasure, "Hungary's family silverware," returned |publisher=Budapest Business Journal |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017 the remaining seven artifacts also got back to Hungary, for a sum of €28 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/kultura/20170712_Baan_hetek_ota_itthon_van_a_Seusokincs_a_TEK_hozta_haza |title=Baán: Hetek óta itthon van a Seuso-kincs, a TEK hozta haza |publisher=HVG |date=12 July 2017 |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The [[treasure trove]] consists of 14 large decorated silver vessels and the copper cauldron which contained them, and has been dated to the late 4th or early 5th century AD. Most notable is a large dish, 70&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and weighing nearly 9&amp;nbsp;kg, which bears the inscription:

: ''Hec Sevso tibi durent per saecula multa''
: ''Posteris ut prosint vascula digna tuis''

: May these, O Seuso, yours for many ages be
: Small vessels fit to serve your offspring worthily.

==Discovery==
[[File:Sümegh józsef 02.jpg|thumb|right|190px|József Sümegh, who is claimed to have found the treasure around 1975–76 near Polgárdi]]The hoard first came to attention in 1980, when a single piece in the possession of two antiquities' dealers from [[Vienna]] was offered for sale in London. Further pieces reached the market, and what is believed to be the complete hoard was acquired by a consortium headed by [[Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton]].&lt;ref name="ATG"&gt;[http://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/news_article_main.asp?id=6000&amp;pt=nb&amp;article_type=stoppress&amp;cp=1&amp;keywords=&amp;phrase=no Antiques Trade Gazette] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929001509/http://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/news_article_main.asp?id=6000&amp;pt=nb&amp;article_type=stoppress&amp;cp=1&amp;keywords=&amp;phrase=no |date=2007-09-29 }}, 30 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Documentation supplied by the Lebanese embassy in Switzerland stated that the treasure had originally been found in the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]] regions of Lebanon, and on that basis the consortium negotiated to sell the collection to the [[Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles]] for $10&amp;nbsp;million. When that deal fell through, the treasure was put up for sale in New York in 1990 by [[Sotheby's]], described as being from "what was once the province of [[Phoenicia]] in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]".

=== Legal wrangling ===
The sale was halted when documentation was thought to be false, and the governments of Hungary, Yugoslavia and Lebanon each made claims of ownership. Hungarian authorities claim that the treasure was discovered by a young soldier, József Sümegh, in around 1975–76 near the town of [[Polgárdi]] in central Hungary.

Yugoslavia's case was based on claims that the treasure had been originally found on 30 June 1960, in the village of [[Barbariga, Croatia|Barbariga]] in [[Istria]] (present-day [[Croatia]]).&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; The village is some 20 kilometres north of the city of [[Pula]], an important city in Roman times. According to local witnesses, the treasure had been discovered in old trenches in a nearby [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) compound.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; In the 1980s the JNA gave permission to local archeologists, led by [[Vesna Girardi-Jurkić]], to further excavate the site. According to unconfirmed eyewitness reports of army excavations, the 14 known artefacts were only a small part of a much larger treasure trove as it took soldiers and police brought to the site six days to list all the items found at the site. However, very few details of the project were ever released to the public as the alleged site was entirely within a military area closed off to civilians.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; Yugoslav archaeologists' efforts eventually failed to provide any conclusive evidence for the treasure's origin, although the soil residue found on the artefacts was proved to match the samples of soil from the area.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"/&gt; After the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] the newly independent Croatia pressed on with the case and included the results of the soil analysis in its formal ownership claim to a New York court.&lt;ref name="jutarnji"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peritz|first1=Romina|title=Borba za neprocjenjivo Seusovo blago|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/borba-za-neprocjenjivo-seusovo-blago-%E2%80%98do-zadnjeg-smo-vjerovali-da-jehrvatsko%E2%80%99/988673/|accessdate=7 October 2016|work=[[Jutarnji list]]|language=Croatian|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1993, the [[New York Court of Appeals]] rejected the claims, and found no case for removing it from the possession of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement (a trust established by the Marquess of Northampton).&lt;ref&gt;''Republic of Croatia, et al. v. Trustee of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement'', 203 A.D.2d 167, 610 N.Y.S.2d 263 (1994); ''Republic of Croatia, et al. v. Trustee of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement'', 232 A.D.2d 616, 648 N.Y.S.2d 25 (1st Dep't 1996).)&lt;/ref&gt; The silver was locked away in a bank vault while further legal proceedings followed. The Marquess sued his solicitors [[Allen &amp; Overy]] for damages in relation to advice given during the purchase of the silver, and that case was settled out of court in 1999 for a reported £15&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 8 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June 1999, in written answers to questions in the [[House of Lords]], the British government confirmed that it had no further interest in the case and confirmed the decision not to prosecute.&lt;ref name="Stationery"&gt;{{cite hansard|jurisdiction=United Kingdom|house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]|title=Sevso Case: Decision not to Prosecute|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo990625/text/90625w01.htm|date=25 June 1999|column=WA111|access-date=2018-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012090039/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo990625/text/90625w01.htm|archive-date=2006-10-12|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hungarian claim of possession is likely justified by the fact that on one of the main plates, the "Hunting Plate", an inscription is to be seen. It reads "Pelso", the Roman name for [[Lake Balaton]] in Hungary; the lake is just west of the alleged place of discovery.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Who Owns the Past?: Cultural Policy, Cultural Property, and the Law|author1=Gibbon, K.F. |author2=American Council for Cultural Policy|date=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=9780813536873 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PigTNxl30ZgC&amp;pg=PA94|page=94 |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also near to the lake, in 1873 a Roman [[tripod]] (later restored, upon which it was discovered that it is a quadripod) was discovered; according to scholars, this object featured similar decoration as the Seuso Treasure items, and is very likely a creation of the same hands. It is housed in the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/11/the-curse-of-the-sevso-silver/302331/|title=The Curse of the Sevso Silver – The Atlantic|publisher=theatlantic.com|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later developments===
In September 2006, London auctioneer [[Bonhams]] announced that it would exhibit the treasure privately, in a move seen as a prelude to a sale by private treaty or by auction at a future date.&lt;ref name="ATG" /&gt; A spokesman for the [[Minister of Education (Hungary)|Ministry of Education and Culture]] of Hungary, which still claims it, said it had informed British authorities that it must not be sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.hu/culture/history/news/D999_news_200486.html "Sevso Treasure Up For Sale" at culture.hu – Hungarian Ministry of Education and Culture.]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 October 2006, further written answers were given in the House of Lords to questions by [[Colin Renfrew, Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn]], particularly relating to Hungary's possible revised claim to the treasure since its [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|admission to the European Union]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61012w0001.htm ''Hansard''] 12 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Bonhams went ahead with its private exhibition on 17 October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartnewspaper.com/afrontpage/pdf/tancurrent.pdf Art Newspaper], [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2393777,00.html Times] and [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1924109,00.html Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vadász tál - Seuso kiállítás, Országház (3).JPG|thumb|right|The "Hunting plate" in the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]]]]

In March 2007, ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'' reported that a further "187 silvergilt spoons, 37 silvergilt drinking cups, and 5 silver bowls", previously unknown, but part of the original hoard, were reputed to exist.&lt;ref name="theartnewspaper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article01.asp?id=581 |title=The silver missing from the Sevso hoard? |publisher=theartnewspaper.com |accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research presented in February 2008 by the Hungarian archaeologist Zsolt Visy strengthened the view that the origin of the treasure may be the Lake Balaton region of Hungary.&lt;ref name="archaeology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/blog/lisa-westcott/sevso-treasure.htm |title=Archaeology of the Sevso Treasure &amp;#124; Current Archaeology  |publisher=archaeology.co.uk|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Channel 4]] archaeology programme ''[[Time Team]]'' aired a [[Time Team (specials)#2008|special on the treasure]] in December 2008.&lt;ref name="channel4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/time-team-specials/episode-guide |title=Time Team Specials – Episode Guide – Channel 4  |publisher=channel4.com|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme presented Hungary's evidence for the likely origin of the hoard being near the town of [[Polgárdi]]. The Marquess of Northampton withdrew from planned participation in the programme and Channel 4 was not given permission to film the treasure, held in a vault at Bonhams auctioneers in London.

==Return to Hungary==
On 26 March 2014, [[Viktor Orbán]], the Hungarian prime minister, announced that half of the Seuso Treasure (seven items) had been returned to Hungary, for a sum of €15 million.&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReturnToHungary2" /&gt; The seven artifacts were put on temporary display at the [[Hungarian Parliament Building]] on 29 March 2014. On 12 July 2017, the [[List of Prime Ministers of Hungary|Hungarian PM]] announced that another seven pieces had been brought back to Hungary, and will be displayed together with the seven items returned to Hungary in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20170712_orban_seuso_kincs_hazakerult#rss |title=Orbán: Hazakerült a Seuso-kincsek további hét darabja |publisher=hvg.hu |date=12 July 2017 |accessdate=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The items will be moved to the Budapest [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] by 2018, where they are intended to be a centrepiece of the new museum's quarter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4228">'''Simplicity theory''' is a cognitive theory that seeks to explain the attractiveness of situations or events to human minds. It is 
based on work done by scientists like Nick Chater, [[Paul Vitanyi]], [[Jean-Louis Dessalles]], and [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]. It claims that interesting 
situations appear simpler than expected to the observer. 

== Overview ==

Technically, simplicity corresponds in a drop in [[Kolmogorov complexity]], which means that, for an observer, the shortest description 
of the situation is shorter than anticipated. For instance, the description of a consecutive lottery draw, such as 22-23-24-25-26-27, is 
significantly shorter than a typical one, such as 12-22-27-37-38-42. The former requires only one instantiation (choice of a number
among all possible numbers in the lottery), whereas the latter requires six instantiations.

Simplicity theory makes several quantitative predictions concerning the way distance, recency, prominence (places, individuals), or 
atypicality influence interestingness. 

== Formalization ==
The basic concept of simplicity theory is ''unexpectedness'', defined as the difference between expected complexity and observed complexity:

:&lt;math&gt;U = C_\text{exp} - C_\text{obs}.&lt;/math&gt;

In most contexts, &lt;math&gt;C_\text{exp}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to ''generation'' complexity, which is the smallest description of all parameters 
that must be set in the "world" for the situation to exist. In the lottery example, generation complexity is identical for a consecutive draw 
and a typical draw (as long as no cheating is imagined) and amounts to six instantiations.

Simplicity theory avoids most criticisms addressed at [[Kolmogorov complexity]] by considering only descriptions that are ''available'' 
to a given ''observer'' (instead of any imaginable description). This amounts to saying that complexity, and thus unexpectedness, are 
observer-dependent. For instance, the typical draw 12-22-27-37-38-42 will appear very simple, even simpler than the consecutive one, to 
the person who played that combination.

== Connection with probability ==
Unexpectedness &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is linked to [[subjective probability]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;P = 2^{-U}.&lt;/math&gt;

The advantage of this formula is that subjective probability can be assessed without necessarily knowing the alternatives. Classical 
approaches to probability would consider all situations in the world as having virtually zero probability to have occurred, as each 
situation is complex and unique. Simplicity theory avoids this trap by considering that subjective improbability is only due to 
complexity drop.

The '''Social Science Research Council''' ('''SSRC''') is a US-based independent nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing research in the [[social sciences]] and related disciplines. Established in Manhattan in 1923, it today maintains a headquarters in [[Brooklyn Heights]] with a staff of approximately 70, and small regional offices in other parts of the world on an as-needed basis.

The SSRC offers several [[Scholarship|fellowships]] to young researchers in the social sciences and related disciplines, mostly for overseas fieldwork.

__TOC__

==History==
===Early history===
The SSRC came into being in 1923 as a result of the initiative of the [[American Political Science Association]]'s committee on research, headed by the association's president, [[Charles E. Merriam]] (1874–1953), who was political science chair at the [[University of Chicago]] and an early champion of behaviorally oriented social science.&lt;ref name="Social Science"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ssrc.org/publications/view/1F20C6E1-565F-DE11-BD80-001CC477EC70/ | title=Social Science Research Council, 1923-1998 | last= | first= | date=2001 | website=Social Science Research Council | accessdate=28 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives of the [[American Economic Association]], the [[American Sociological Society]], and the [[American Statistical Association]] joined with Merriam and his associates in forming the world's first coordinating body of the social sciences.

Other national associations—in [[anthropology]], [[history]], and [[psychology]]—designated representatives to the new entity, named the Social Science Research Council (SSRC), in the year following its incorporation on December 27, 1924. (In subsequent years, the membership would expand to include representatives from [[law]], [[geography]], [[psychiatry]], and [[medicine]].)

To support its work, the SSRC turned not to the US government, whose support seemed more appropriate for the natural sciences, but to private foundations. For the first fifty years, well over three-quarters of the SSRC's funding was provided by the [[Russell Sage Foundation]], the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Carnegie Corporation]], and two [[Rockefeller]] philanthropies, the [[Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rockarch.org/collections/nonrockorgs/ssrc.php | title=Social Science Research Council Archives, 1924-1990 | last= | first= | date= | website=Rockefeller Archive Center | accessdate=28 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSRC was part of a wider [[Progressive Era]] movement to develop organizations of expertise that could dispense disinterested knowledge to policymakers. These organizations would tap leading thinkers in various fields to think creatively about how to rid the nation of the social and political ills brought on by the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Other independent, nongovernmental, policy-minded institutions founded in that era included the [[American Law Institute]] (1923), the [[Brookings Institution]] (1927), and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] (1921).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Judis | first=John B. | date=1 March 2001 | title=The Paradox of American Democracy: Elites, Special Interests, and the Betrayal of Public Trust | url= | location= | publisher=Routledge Chapman Hall | page=19 | isbn=978-0415930260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council's main distinguishing feature was its commitment to the advancement of research in the [[social sciences]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;According to an early boilerplate, the purpose of the SSRC was to "plan, foster, promote and develop research in the social field."&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to other Progressive-Era institutions, the SSRC represented a new kind of hybrid—one that was in some ways defined more by what it wasn't than what it was. It was not a governmental body, thus was removed from the pressures of Washington and public calls for quick-fix solutions to social problems. It was not an academic association—so was freed from disciplinary boundaries. It was not a university and hence did not have to confront competing demands for services unrelated to research.&lt;ref name="Social Science" /&gt;

Along with Merriam, two individuals were especially vital to the SSRC's early success. One was [[Wesley Clair Mitchell]] (1874–1948), one of the founders of the [[New School for Social Research]] and a leading force behind the emergence of the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] in the 1920s. The other was [[Beardsley Ruml]], who had trained in [[psychometrics]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. Ruml was active in the early phases of Rockefeller philanthropies. He poured Rockefeller resources into the social sciences in general and the SSRC in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

All three men channeled their progressive values into the cause of empirical research and knowledge. In his 2001 history of the SSRC, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100610025918/http://marymount.mmm.edu/cgi-bin/MySQLdb?MYSQL_VIEW=%2Ffaculty%2Fview_one.txt&amp;webid=224 Kenton Worcester] highlighted four aspects of their founding vision that remain central to this day:&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, pp. 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Interdisciplinarity:''' The SSRC was constructed as a platform on which scholars from various disciplines and traditions (including the natural sciences and humanities) could come together in a spirit of problem-solving intellectual cross-fertilization.
# '''Intermediary role:''' The federal government was not prepared to put its weight behind a central funding agency for the social sciences. Thus the SSRC frequently acted as an intermediary between researchers and research-supporting foundations, assuming the functions of assessing research priorities and disbursing research funds.
# '''Institutional flexibility:''' The SSRC was designed to be as elastic as possible, to take advantage of changing social conditions and methods of investigation. Even in its early days, the Council’s research planning committees were expected to carry out their work for a limited span of time, and for the same reason fellowship programs were kept going only as long as they were judged to be effective.
# '''Scientific advance in the greater interests of society:''' The SSRC's founders believed that the social sciences should address real-world concerns. They wanted to see social science move in a more data-sensitive, empirical direction.

Starting in the mid-1920s the Council sponsored annual conferences and launched its Research Training Fellowships program.

Committees launched in the 1920s and 1930s included:
* Agriculture (1925–42)
* Crime (1925–32)
* Industrial Relations (1926–30)
* Business Research (1928–31)
* Pressure Groups and Propaganda (1931–34)
* Government Statistics and Information Services (1933–37)
* Social Security (1935–45)

One of the Council's first acts was to urge Congress to appropriate funds sufficient to allow the [[Library of Congress]] to publish an annual index of state laws. As early as 1923, the SSRC cooperated with the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] in a study of human migration from a social standpoint, said to be the institution's first global endeavor.

[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] served as a member of the Council's Advisory Committee on Business Research (1928–1931). After he became president, collaborations between administration officials, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], Council staff, and Council networks led to the committee work that accompanied the formulation and implementation of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the Council served as a bridge between the Roosevelt administration and the social sciences, working behind the scenes to ensure that qualified social scientists were placed with appropriate agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; It joined forces with its humanities counterpart, the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (ACLS), and other partners to form the [[Ethnogeographic Board]], with the mission of providing information about unfamiliar societies with which the war was suddenly bringing Americans into contact. The Board developed a roster of people with specialized area knowledge and conducted a survey of nascent [[area studies]] programs in American universities.&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, reprinted in Worcester, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-World War II===
The identity of the Council in the latter half of the 20th century would closely overlap the development of [[area studies]]&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; and the promotion of [[modernization theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gilman | first=Nils | date=15 February 2007 | title=Mandarins of the Future: Modernization Theory in Cold War America | url= | location= | publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press | page= | isbn=978-0801886331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of World War II, there was widespread consensus on the need for the United States to invest in international studies. Liberals and conservatives alike viewed the creation of a large brain trust of internationally oriented political scientists and economists as an urgent national priority. There was considerable tension, however, between those who felt strongly that, instead of applying Western models, social scientists should develop culturally and historically contextualized knowledge of various parts of the world by working closely with humanists, and those who thought that social scientists should seek to develop overarching macrohistorical theories that could draw connections between patterns of change and development across different geographies. The former became [[area studies]] advocates, the latter proponents of [[modernization theory]].

In this context, the postwar SSRC had two separate agendas, which to some extent were at odds with each other because they entailed very different sets of methodological commitments: [[ideographic]] versus [[nomothetic]]. On the one hand, the SSRC was keen to join forces with the country's major foundations—most notably, the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], and the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]]—to promote area studies. For this agenda, it already had a natural institutional partner, the ACLS; indeed, the two councils had worked during the war mapping out US-based foreign studies. 

On the other hand, the SSRC also wished to promote behavioralist social science—an agenda that directly descended from [[Charles Merriam]]'s prewar concerns.

To further its interests in area studies, the SSRC teamed up with the ACLS in administering Area Research Training Fellowships with funds from the [[Carnegie Corporation]] and in forming the Committee on World Area Research. In the words of SSRC historian Eldrige Sibley: "[T]his committee served as the primary planning, coordinating and evaluating agency at the national level for the entire foreign area and language movement in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, reprinted in Worcester, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

To further its behavioralist agenda, the SSRC set up various other committees—including, most notably, the Committee on Political Behavior, organized in 1945 by [[Pendelton Herring]] and headed at various times by [[David Truman]], [[David Easton]], and [[Robert Dahl]], all of whom would serve as presidents of the [[American Political Science Association]]; and the [[Committee on Comparative Politics]], organized in 1953 and headed by [[Gabriel Almond]] and then [[Lucian Pye]], both of whom also became APSA presidents.

The SSRC's agenda for the behavioral social sciences largely came apart in the 1970s, leaving area studies as its central platform. By then, the SSRC and the ACLS had emerged as the national nexus for raising and administering funds for area studies. They created and managed about a dozen joint committees covering:
* Africa (1960–96)
* China (1981–96)
* Eastern Europe (1971–96)
* Japan (1967–96)
* Korea (1967–96)
* Latin America (1942–47; 1959–96)
* Muslim Societies (1985–93)
* Near and Middle East (1959–96)
* South Asia (1976–96)
* Southeast Asia (1976–96)
* Soviet Union (1983–96) [successor to Committee on Slavic and East European Studies (1971–77) and Slavic and East European Studies Committee (1948–71)]
* Western Europe (1975–96)

The joint SSRC-ACLS committees would accomplish most of their work—field development workshops, conferences, and publications—with funding from the [[Ford Foundation]]. In 1972 Ford conferred to the two councils the responsibility for managing its centerpiece program, the Foreign Area Fellowship Program (FAFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/multi/interaction/0507/area.html | title=The new world of area studies | last=Goldstein | first=Judith | date=2007 | website=Stanford University | accessdate=28 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Szanton | first=David | date=September 2004 | title=The Politics of Knowledge Area Studies and the Disciplines | url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520245365/the-politics-of-knowledge | location= | publisher=University of California | page= | isbn=9780520245365 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next 30 years, the SSRC and the ACLS would award approximately 3,000 area studies dissertation fellowships and, with funds from other foundations as well, another 2,800 postdoctoral area studies research grants. In Kenton Worcester's words: "The cumulative total of awards for field research outside the United States was staggering."&lt;ref&gt;Statistics are from Worcester, Part Two.&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual reports of the SSRC indicate that the area committees had an impressive record of productivity and influence on area studies and the disciplines they encompassed.&lt;ref&gt;David Ludden, "Area Studies in the Age of Globalization," 1/25/98 paper. http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~dludden/areast2.htm. Retrieved 2009-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, scholars appeared to appreciate the fertile ground the SSRC/ACLS area committees provided for interdisciplinary scholarship. As Korea specialist [[Bruce Cumings]] put it: "For decades [these committees] offered a rare venue where one could see what a historian thought of the work of an economist, or what a literary critic thought of behavioralist sociology." According to Cumings, the SSRC was particularly appreciated as a meeting ground between traditional social science disciplines and area studies.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Cumings, "Boundary Displacement: Area Studies and International Studies during and after the Cold War," in ''Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars'' 29 (1997). http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/cumings2.htm. Retrieved 2009-04-23. See also Szanton, ''The Politics of Knowledge'', p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when area studies occupied center stage, the SSRC continued to support advanced research on social themes of the day. In the 1970s and 1980s, it convened committees addressing such topics as cognitive research, law and social science, international peace and security, states and social structures, the urban underclass, and urban migration.&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, pp. 65–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council's forays into non-area studies were limited, however, by the challenges of the funding environment. In the immediate postwar period, the SSRC had benefited from unprecedented federal support of social and domestic programs, as well as increased public attention to social science research. But the growing tide of American [[conservatism]], begun in the 1950s, eventually led to a populist backlash against federal funding of social research. By the time President [[Ronald Reagan]] assumed office, the political atmosphere had soured over the role of the social sciences and public investment in social research.&lt;ref&gt;Worcester, pp. 57–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Cold War===
The end of the [[Cold War]] and the quickening pace of globalization turned the future of area studies into the number one issue for Council management in the concluding years of the 20th century. Under the stewardship of four successive presidents—[[David Featherman]] (1989–1995), [[Kenneth Prewitt]] (1995–1098), [[Orville Gilbert Brim Jr.]] (1998–1999), and [[Craig Calhoun]] (1999–2012)—the SSRC closed down its area committees in favor of a reorganized international program with thematic, cross-regional, and cross-cultural components. According to this vision, the area studies field would be transformed and integrated into traditional social science disciplines—especially, [[economics]], [[sociology]], and [[political science]]. Emphasis would shift from country and area to theme and context-sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Heginbotham, 'Rethinking International Scholarship: The Challenge of Transition from the Cold War Era," ''Items'' 48.2-3 (June–September 1996), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SSRC's records are stored in the [http://www.rockarch.org/ Rockefeller Archive Center], North Tarrytown, New York.

==Fellowships and other awards==
Since 1923, the SSRC has funded the research of over ten thousand fellows. Most SSRC fellowships are conducted through annual, peer-reviewed competitions and offer support for predissertation, dissertation, and postdoctoral work. And, although most SSRC fellowships target the social sciences, a number also engage the humanities, the natural sciences, and relevant professional and practitioner communities.

The SSRC established the [http://www.ssrc.org/hirschman Albert O. Hirschman Prize] in 2007 to recognize academic excellence in international, interdisciplinary social science research, theory, and public communication in the tradition of German-born American economist [[Albert Hirschman]]. The first two Hirschman Prize recipients are [[Dani Rodrik]] (2007) and [[Charles Tilly]] (2008). The latter received the prize just weeks before his death.

== Objective ==
Stiftung Lesen acts as an advocate for reading and media competency in Germany to ensure that every child and adult in Germany develops crucial reading and media skills, and enjoys reading. Stiftung Lesen’s initiatives and programmes as well as pilot and research projects complement and build on each other. The programmes support early infant development in the family and nurseries when the basis of reading competency is laid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=EURead|title=The social context of the foundation's work|url=http://www.euread.com/organisations/details/stiftung_lesen/|website=www.euread.com|publisher=Stiftung Lesen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. Older children and teenagers are reached through projects in- and outside school, covering their future development. In addition to the children benefitting directly, actors chaperoning the children’s development such as parents, childcare workers, teachers, booksellers and librarians are integrated in the programmes. To promote its activities the foundation has partnered with such well-known organizations as ''[[Die Zeit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Suberin''', [[cutin]] and [[lignin]]s are complex, higher plant epidermis and periderm cell-wall macromolecules, forming a protective barrier. Suberin, a complex polyester [[biopolymer]], is lipophilic, and composed of long chain fatty acids called suberin acids, and glycerol. Suberins and lignins are considered covalently linked to lipids and carbohydrates, respectively, and lignin is covalently linked to suberin, and to a lesser extent, to cutin.&lt;ref&gt;{{PMID|17801473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{PMID|26579510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernards|first=M.A.|title=Demystifying suberin|journal=Canadian Journal of Botany|date=March 2002|volume=80|issue=3|pages=227–240(14)|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/nrc/cjb/2002/00000080/00000003/art00001#expand/collapse|accessdate=13 September 2012|doi=10.1139/b02-017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suberin is a major constituent of [[cork (material)|cork]], and is named after the [[cork oak]], ''Quercus suber''. Its main function is as a barrier to movement of [[water]] and [[solutes]].

==Anatomy and physiology==
Suberin is highly [[hydrophobic]] and a somewhat 'rubbery' material. In [[root]]s suberin is deposited in the radial and transverse [[cell wall]]s of the endodermal [[cell (biology)|cells]]. This structure, known as the [[Casparian strip]] or Casparian band, functions to prevent water and nutrients taken up by the root from entering the [[Stele (biology)|stele]] through the [[apoplast]]. Instead, water must bypass the [[endodermis]] via the [[symplast]]. This allows the plant to select the solutes that pass further into the plant. It thus forms an important barrier to harmful solutes.&lt;ref name="Kolattukudy1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolattukudy|first1=P. E.|title=Biochemistry and function of cutin and suberin|journal=Canadian Journal of Botany|volume=62|issue=12|year=1984|pages=2918–2933|issn=0008-4026|doi=10.1139/b84-391}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[mangrove]]s use suberin to minimize [[salt]] intake from their [[littoral]] habitat.

Suberin is found in the [[phellem]] layer of the [[periderm]] (or cork). This is outermost layer of the [[Bark (botany)|bark]]. The cells in this layer are dead and abundant in suberin, preventing water loss from the tissues below. Suberin can also be found in various other plant structures. For example, they are present in the [[lenticel]]s on the stems of many plants and the net structure in the rind of a [[netted melon]] is composed of suberised cells.

==Structure and biosynthesis==
Suberin consists of two domains, a [[aromatic|polyaromatic]] and a [[aliphatic|polyaliphatic]] domain.&lt;ref name="Kolattukudy1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolattukudy|first1=P. E.|title=Biopolyester Membranes of Plants: Cutin and Suberin|journal=Science|volume=208|issue=4447|year=1980|pages=990–1000|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.208.4447.990|pmid=17779010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polyaromatics are predominantly located within the primary cell wall, and the polyaliphatics are located between the [[primary cell wall]] and the [[cell membrane]]. The two domains are supposed to be cross-linked. The exact qualitative and quantitative composition of suberin [[monomer]]s varies in different species. Some common [[aliphatic]] monomers include α-hydroxyacids (mainly 18-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid) and α,ω-diacids (mainly octadec-9-ene-1,18-dioic acid). The monomers of the polyaromatics are [[hydroxycinnamic acid]]s and derivatives, such as feruloyltyramine.

In addition to the aromatics and aliphatics components, [[glycerol]] has been reported a major suberin component in some [[species]]. The role of glycerol is proposed to interlink aliphatic monomers, and possibly also to link polyaliphatics to polyaromatics, during suberin [[polymer]] assembly. The [[polymerization]] step of aromatic monomers has been shown to involve a [[peroxidase]] reaction.

The [[biosynthesis]] of the aliphatic monomers shares the same upstream reactions with [[cutin]] biosynthesis, and the biosynthesis of aromatics shares the same upstream reactions with [[lignin]] biosynthesis.

[[Phlobaphen]] also occurs in the polyaromatic part of the suberin mixture.

'''Surface roughness''' often shortened to '''roughness''', is a component of [[surface finish|surface texture]]. It is quantified by the deviations in the direction of the [[normal (geometry)|normal vector]] of a real surface from its ideal form. If these deviations are large, the surface is rough; if they are small, the surface is smooth. In [[surface metrology]], roughness is typically considered to be the high-frequency, short-wavelength component of a measured surface. However, in practice it is often necessary to know both the amplitude and frequency to ensure that a surface is fit for a purpose.

Roughness plays an important role in determining how a real object will interact with its environment. In [[tribology]], rough surfaces usually [[wear]] more quickly and have higher [[friction]] coefficients than smooth surfaces. Roughness is often a good predictor of the performance of a mechanical component, since irregularities on the surface may form nucleation sites for cracks or corrosion. On the other hand, roughness may promote [[adhesive|adhesion]]. Generally speaking, rather than scale specific descriptors, cross-scale descriptors such as [[fractal|surface fractality]] provide more meaningful predictions of mechanical interactions at surfaces including [[contact mechanics|contact stiffness]] &lt;ref name="surf"&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Zhai | first1=C. | last2= Gan |first2=Y. | last3= Hanaor | first3=D. | last4=Proust |first4=G. | last5=Retraint |first5=D. |title=  The Role of Surface Structure in Normal Contact Stiffness | journal= Experimental Mechanics  | year= 2016 |  volume=56 | issue=3 | pages=359–368| url= https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chongpu_Zhai/publication/283158084_The_Role_of_Surface_Structure_in_Normal_Contact_Stiffness/links/562d7b4b08ae04c2aeb4a68a.pdf | doi= 10.1007/s11340-015-0107-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[friction|static friction]].&lt;ref name="statfric"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Hanaor | first1= D. | last2=Gan |first2= Y. |last3=Einav | first3= I. | title= Static friction at fractal interfaces| journal= Tribology International | year=2016 | volume=93 | pages=229–238| url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283675011_Static_friction_at_fractal_interfaces}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a high roughness value is often undesirable, it can be difficult and expensive to control in [[manufacturing]]. For example, it is difficult and expensive to control surface roughness of fused deposition modelling (FDM) manufactured parts.&lt;ref&gt;http://manufacturingscience.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=2475087&lt;/ref&gt; 
Decreasing the roughness of a surface usually increases its manufacturing cost. This often results in a trade-off between the manufacturing cost of a component and its performance in application.

Roughness can be measured by manual comparison against a "surface roughness comparator" (a sample of known surface roughness), but more generally a [[surface profile measurement]] is made with a [[profilometer]]. These can be of the contact variety (typically a diamond stylus) or optical (e.g.: a white light [[interferometer]] or laser scanning confocal microscope).

However, controlled roughness can often be desirable. For example, a gloss surface can be too shiny to the eye and too slippery to the finger (a touchpad is a good example) so a controlled roughness is required. This is a case where both amplitude and frequency are very important.

==Parameters==
A roughness value can either be calculated on a profile (line) or on a surface (area). The profile roughness parameter (Ra, Rq,...) are more common. The area roughness parameters (Sa, Sq,...) give more significant values.

=== Profile roughness parameters ===
Each of the roughness parameters are calculated using a formula for describing the surface. Standard references that describe each in detail are Surfaces and their Measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitehouse|first=David|title=Surfaces and their Measurement|year=2012|location=Boston |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |isbn=978-0080972015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Roughness rus.png|600px|thumb]] The profile roughness parameters are included in BS EN ISO 4287:2000 British standard, identical with the ISO 4287:1997 standard.&lt;ref&gt;BS EN ISO 4287:2000, Geometrical product specification (GPS). Surface  texture. Profile method. Terms, definitions and surface texture parameters&lt;/ref&gt; The standard is based on the  ″M″ (mean line) system.
There are many different roughness parameters in use, but &lt;math&gt;Ra&lt;/math&gt; is by far the most common, though this is often for historical reasons and not for particular merit, as the early roughness meters could only measure &lt;math&gt;Ra&lt;/math&gt;. Other common parameters include &lt;math&gt;Rz&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Rq&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Rsk&lt;/math&gt;. Some parameters are used only in certain industries or within certain countries. For example, the &lt;math&gt;Rk&lt;/math&gt; family of parameters is used mainly for cylinder bore linings, and the ''Motif parameters'' are used primarily in the French automotive industry.&lt;ref&gt;Dietzsch M., Papenfluss K., Hartmann, T. ''The MOTIF method (ISO'' ''12085: 1996)- A suitable description for functional, manufactural and metrological requirements'', International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture, 1998, 38, No 5-6, pp. 625-632&lt;/ref&gt; The MOTIF method provides a graphical evaluation of a surface profile without filtering waviness from roughness. A ''motif'' consists of the portion of a profile between two peaks and the final combinations of these motifs eliminate ″insignificant″ peaks and retains ″significant″ ones.  Please note that &lt;math&gt;Ra&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensional unit that can be [[Micrometre|micrometer]] or [[microinch]].

Since these parameters reduce all of the information in a profile to a single number, great care must be taken in applying and interpreting them. Small changes in how the raw profile data is filtered, how the mean line is calculated, and the physics of the measurement can greatly affect the calculated parameter. With modern digital equipment, the scan can be evaluated to make sure there are no obvious glitches that skew the values.

Because it may not be obvious to many users what each of the measurements really mean, a simulation tool allows a user to adjust key parameters, visualizing how surfaces which are obviously different to the human eye are differentiated by the measurements. For example, &lt;math&gt;Ra&lt;/math&gt; fails to distinguish between two surfaces where one is composed of peaks on an otherwise smooth surface and the other is composed of troughs of the same amplitude. Such tools can be found in app format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SPE (Surface Profile Explorer) |url=http://www.stevenabbott.co.uk/AbbottApps/SPE/index.html |work=AbbottApps |publisher=Steven Abbott TCNF Ltd|first=Steven |last=Abbott|accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By convention every 2D roughness parameter is a capital R followed by additional characters in the subscript. The subscript identifies the formula that was used, and the R means that the formula was applied to a 2D roughness profile. Different capital letters imply that the formula was applied to a different profile. For example, Ra is the arithmetic average of the roughness profile, Pa is the arithmetic average of the unfiltered raw profile, and Sa is the arithmetic average of the 3D roughness.

Each of the formulas listed in the tables assume that the roughness profile has been filtered from the raw profile data and the mean line has been calculated. The roughness profile contains &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; ordered, equally spaced points along the trace, and &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the vertical distance from the mean line to the &lt;math&gt;i^\text{th}&lt;/math&gt; data point. Height is assumed to be positive in the up direction, away from the bulk material.

==== Amplitude parameters ====
Amplitude parameters characterize the surface based on the vertical deviations of the roughness profile from the mean line. Many of them are closely related to the parameters found in statistics for characterizing population samples. For example, &lt;math&gt;Ra&lt;/math&gt; is the [[arithmetic average]] value of filtered roughness profile determined from deviations about the center line within the evaluation length and &lt;math&gt;Rt&lt;/math&gt; is the [[range (statistics)|range]] of the collected roughness data points.

The arithmetic average roughness, &lt;math&gt;Ra&lt;/math&gt;, is the most widely used one-dimensional roughness parameter.

==== Slope, spacing, and counting parameters ====
Slope parameters describe characteristics of the slope of the roughness profile. Spacing and counting parameters describe how often the profile crosses certain thresholds. These parameters are often used to describe repetitive roughness profiles, such as those produced by [[turning]] on a [[lathe]].

Other "frequency" parameters are S&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;. S&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the mean spacing between peaks. Just as with real mountains it is important to define a "peak". For S&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; the surface must have dipped below the mean surface before rising again to a new peak. The average wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and the root mean square wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; are derived from &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. When trying to understand a surface that depends on both amplitude and frequency it is not obvious which pair of metrics optimally describes the balance, so a statistical analysis of pairs of measurements can be performed (e.g.: R&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; or R&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and Sm) to find the strongest correlation.

Common conversions:

==== Bearing ratio curve parameters ====
These parameters are based on the [[Abbott-Firestone curve|bearing ratio curve]] (also known as the Abbott-Firestone curve.) This includes the Rk family of parameters.

[[Image:Surface roughness skew2.svg|thumb|widthpx| Sketches depicting surfaces with negative and positive skew. The roughness trace is on the left, the amplitude distribution curve is in the middle, and the bearing area curve (Abbott-Firestone curve) is on the right.]]

==== Fractal theory ====
The mathematician [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] has pointed out the connection between surface roughness and [[fractal dimension]].&lt;ref name="Outeretal1995"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Den Outer |first1= A. |last2= Kaashoek |first2= J.F. |last3= Hack |first3= H.R.G.K. |year= 1995 |title= Difficulties of using continuous fractal theory for discontinuity surfaces |journal= International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Science &amp; Geomechanics Abstracts |volume= 32 |number= 1 |pages= 3–9 |doi= 10.1016/0148-9062(94)00025-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The description provided by a [[fractal]] at the microroughness level may allow the control of the material properties and the type of the occurring chip formation. But fractals cannot provide a full-scale representation of a typical machined surface affected by tool feed marks, it ignores the geometry of the cutting edge. (J. Paulo Davim, 2010, ''op.cit''.).

===Areal roughness parameters===
{{further|ISO 25178{{!}}ISO 25178: Geometric Product Specifications (GPS) – Surface texture: areal}}
Areal roughness parameters are defined in the ISO 25178 series. The resulting values are Sa, Sq, Sz,... Many optical measurement instruments are able to measure the surface roughness over an area. Area measurements are also possible with contact measurement systems. Multiple, closely spaced 2D scans are taken of the target area. These are then digitally stitched together using relevant software, resulting in a 3D image and accompanying areal roughness parameters.

== Soil-surface roughness ==
Soil-surface roughness (SSR) refers to the vertical variations present in the micro- and macro-relief of a soil surface, as well as their stochastic distribution.  There are four distinct classes of SSR, each one of them representing a characteristic vertical length scale; the first class includes microrelief variations from individual soil grains to aggregates on the order of 0.053–2.0 mm; the second class consists of variations due to soil clods ranging between 2 and 100 mm; the third class of soil surface roughness is systematic elevation differences due to tillage, referred to as oriented roughness (OR), ranging between 100 and 300 mm;  the fourth class includes planar curvature, or macro-scale topographic features&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Römkens|first=M.J.M|last2=Helming|first2=K|last3=Prasad|first3=S.N|title=Soil erosion under different rainfall intensities, surface roughness, and soil water regimes|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0341816201001618|journal=CATENA|volume=46|issue=2-3|pages=103–123|doi=10.1016/s0341-8162(01)00161-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The two first classes account for the so-called microroughness, which has been shown to be largely influenced on an event and seasonal timescale by rainfall and tillage, respectively.  Microroughness is most commonly quantified by means of the Random Roughness, which is essentially the standard deviation of bed surface elevation data around the mean elevation, after correction for slope using the best-fit plane and removal of tillage effects in the individual height readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Total_Porosity_and_Random_Roughness_of_t.html?id=ipMYogEACAAJ|title=Total Porosity and Random Roughness of the Interrow Zone as Influenced by Tillage|last=Allmaras|first=R. R.|date=1966|publisher=Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rainfall impact can lead to either a decay or increase in microroughnesss, depending upon initial microroughness conditions and soil properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K. N. Potter|last2=Potter|first2=K.

However, a recent study which examined the response of smooth soil surfaces on rainfall showed that RR can considerably increase for low initial microroughness length scales in the order of 0 - 5 mm.  It was also shown that the increase or decrease is consistent among various SSR indices &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abban|first=B. K. B.|last2=Papanicolaou|first2=A. N.

==Practical effects==
Surface structure plays a key role in governing [[contact mechanics]],&lt;ref name="surf" /&gt; that is to say the mechanical behavior exhibited at an interface between two solid objects as they approach each other and transition from conditions of non-contact to full contact. In particular, [[normal contact stiffness]] is governed predominantly by asperity structures (roughness, surface slope and fractality) and material properties.

In terms of engineering surfaces, roughness is considered to be detrimental to part performance. As a consequence, most manufacturing prints establish an upper limit on roughness, but not a lower limit. An exception is in cylinder bores where oil is retained in the surface profile and a minimum roughness is required.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enginebuildermag.com/2000/09/cylinder-bore-surface-finishes/&lt;/ref&gt;

Surface structure is often closely related to the friction and wear properties of a surface.&lt;ref name="statfric" /&gt; A surface with a higher [[fractal dimension]], large &lt;math&gt;R_a&lt;/math&gt; value, or a positive &lt;math&gt;R_{sk}&lt;/math&gt;, will usually have somewhat higher friction and wear quickly. The peaks in the roughness profile are not always the points of contact. The form and waviness (i.e. both amplitude and frequency) must also be considered.

The '''technological and industrial history of Canada''' encompasses the country's development in the areas of transportation, communication, energy, materials, public works, public services (health care), domestic/consumer and defence technologies.

The terms chosen for the "age" described below are both literal and metaphorical. They describe the technology that dominated the period of time in question but are also representative of a large number of other technologies introduced during the same period. Also of note is the fact that the period of diffusion of a technology can begin modestly and can extend well beyond the "age" of its introduction. To maintain continuity, the treatment of its diffusion is dealt with in the context of its dominant "age".

Technology is a major cultural determinant, no less important in shaping human lives than philosophy, religion, social organization, or political systems. In the broadest sense, these forces are also aspects of technology. The French sociologist Jacques Ellul defined ''la technique'' as the totality of all rational methods in every field of human activity so that, for example, education, law, sports, propaganda, and the social sciences are all technologies in that sense. At the other end of the scale, common parlance limits the term's meaning to specific industrial arts.

== The late Electric Age (1901–1920) ==

===Industrial processes and techniques===
Metal mining also became significant industry during this period. The International Nickel Company ([[Vale Inco|Inco]]) was established in 1902 through the fusion of two companies. A refinery using the Orford process was built in Port Colborne, Ontario in 1918 and then moved to Copper Cliff, Ontario, where that technique was replaced by the matte flotation process in 1948. Hard rock gold mining became practical in 1887, with the development of the potassium cyanidation process, by Scott MacArthur, which was used to separate the gold from the ore. This technique was first used in Canada at the Mikado Mine in the Lake-of-the-Woods Region again made accessible by the CPR.  The CPR also provided access to the B.C. interior, where lead, copper, silver and gold ores had been discovered in the Rossland area in 1891. The ores were transported to Trail, B.C., where they were roasted. After CPR built the Crowsnest Pass it purchased the Trail roasting facility and in 1899 built a blast furnace to smelt lead ore. In 1902 the first electrolytic lead refining plant using the Betts Cell Process began operation in Trail.  The Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada Ltd. was founded as a CPR subsidiary and began to develop the Sullivan Mine with its lead, zinc and silver ores, in Kimberley in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Mouat, Jeremy, Metal Mining in Canada, 1840 −1950, Transformation Series 9, National Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912 the Dominion Coal Company produced 40% of Canada’s total coal output.&lt;ref&gt;Muise, McIntosh, Coal Mining in Canada: A Historical and Comparative Overview, Transformation Series 5, National Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 a company in Bowmanville, Ontario, began Canada’s first [[powdered milk]] production operation. The large-scale home delivery of milk began in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal in 1900.

===Materials===
Railway and locomotive construction in the latter 19th century created a huge demand for [[steel]]. The Bessemer furnace at the Algom steel mill in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario went into operation in 1902. The [[Montreal Rolling Mills]] Co, The [[Hamilton Steel and Iron Company]], the Canada Screw Company, the Canada Bolt and Nut Company, and the Dominion Wire Manufacturing Company were consolidated in 1910 to form The [[Stelco|Steel Company of Canada]] headquartered in Toronto. With mills located in Hamilton and other cities, it was the largest producer of steel in Canada for most of the century. Its competitor, the Dominion Steel Castings Company Limited founded in 1912, renamed the Dominion Foundries and Steel Company in 1917 and [[Dofasco]] in 1980, had its Hamilton facilities located next to those of [[Stelco]].

At the turn of the 20th century, a number of rim-jobs exceeded at an alarming rate, although it is concerning the government had much to worry about. Health concerns were identified, and its use was generally discontinued by the late 20th century.

The modern version of [[plywood]] was invented in the US in 1905 in Portland, Oregon. In 1913, the Fraser Mills in New Westminster, British Columbia, produced the first Canadian plywood, primarily from Douglas fir. This new material eventually found use in a wide variety of structures, including auto running boards, panelling, sub-floors, roof sheathing, wall sheathing, shipping crates and, during World War II, the manufacturing of aircraft and small ships.
 
The [[pulp and paper]] industry also developed during these years. The closely related sulphate pulp process was introduced in Canada in 1907, when the Brompton Pulp &amp; Paper Company began operation in East Angus, Quebec. This process dominates the industry to this day. The pulp slurry was fed in a continuous stream into a paper-making machine that flattened, pressed and dried it into newsprint on huge rolls many metres wide and containing thousands of meters of paper.

===Office automation===
Business and public administration was improved and simplified with the introduction of the [[typewriter]], which acquired a familiar standardized form by about 1910, which features the "qwerty" keyboard, the typebar, ribbon, cylinder and carriage return lever. Popular models in Canada were manufactured by the US Remington and Underwood companies, among others. The introduction of the mechanical [[desk calculator]] complemented that of the typewriter. Most machines used in Canada were manufactured in the US by companies such as Friden, Monroe, and SCM/Marchant. The Gestetner copy machine, which used the stencil technique to reproduce copies of documents, was invented in England in 1881 by [[David Gestetner]] and quickly became popular in offices around the world, including those in Canada.

===Public works and civil engineering===
Notable works of civil engineering realized the completion of: the [[New Westminster Bridge]], Vancouver 1904, the Lethbridge Viaduct, Lethbridge, Alberta, 1909, the [[Spiral Tunnels]], Hector to Field BC, 1909, the St. Andrew's Lock and Dam, Lockport, Manitoba, 1910,  the Brooks Aqueduct, Brooks, Albert, 1914, the [[Quebec Bridge]], Ste-Foy, Quebec, 1916, the [[Connaught Tunnel]], Rogers Pass, BC, 1916, the Ogden Point Breakwater and Docks, Victoria, British Columbia, 1917, the Prince Edward Viaduct, Toronto, Ontario, 1919, the Shoal Lake Aqueduct, Winnipeg, Manitoba, 1919 and the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]], Ontario, 1920.

In the 1930s diesel-powered excavation shovels replaced steam shovels for the excavation of railway right-of-ways and the digging of basements and foundations for skyscrapers and domestic housing, in the late 19th century.

===Skyscrapers and architecture ===
It was the age of the [[skyscraper]] and the race to build the tallest structure in the British Empire set off a competition among cities across Canada. Successive record holders included the Traders Bank of Canada, 15 floors, Yonge St, Toronto, 1905, the Dominion Building, 13 floors, Vancouver, 1910, World (Sun) Tower, 17 floors, Vancouver, 1912, the Canadian Pacific Building, 16 floors, Toronto, 1913, the Royal Bank, 20 floors, Toronto, 1915, the Royal Bank, Montreal, 1928, the Royal York Hotel, Toronto, 1929 and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto, in 1931.

===Central heating===
The construction of skyscrapers, grand hotels and other large buildings led to the development of [[central heating]], an essential feature in Canada's cold climate. In the 20th century such systems were used to provide heat to small communities such as university campuses, northern industrial towns or military bases. Smaller systems were used in private homes. Another technique, the convection method, was introduced to domestic dwellings at this time. A metal furnace in the basement, using wood or coal as fuel, would heat air in a plenum which would rise by convection through a series of metal ducts into the rooms of the house above. When the air cooled it would fall to the floor and return to the plenum through another series of metal return ducts. In later years an electric fan was used to force the hot air from the plenum through the ducts.

===Domestic and consumer technology===

The introduction of the flush toilet in the US and Canada in the 1880s created a market that inspired the invention of rolled [[toilet paper]]. The product was first produced in the US by the Albany Perforated Wrapping Paper Company in 1877. The US Scott Paper Company began manufacturing toilette paper in 1902 and by 1925 Scott Paper was the largest manufacturer of toilette paper in the world. As early as 1926 the Purex brand had been established in Canada and with the arrival of Scott Paper Canada in 1927 the White Swan brand was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, About.com, inventors.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;sdn=inventors&amp;cdn=money&amp;tm=14&amp;gps=94_60_978_623&amp;f=10&amp;tt=2&amp;bt=1&amp;bts=1&amp;zu=http%3A//www.toiletpaperworld.com/tpw/encyclopedia/navigation/funfacts.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
The introduction of medical [[x-ray]]s during this period dramatically improved medical diagnostics. Discovered by Roentgen in Germany in 1895, x-ray units were in operation at the Toronto and [[Montreal General Hospital]]s by the turn of the century. The sphygmomanometer or blood pressure meter, that familiar device employing a cuff placed around the patients arm, found its way into the office of most Canadian doctors in the early 20th century. The spread of bovine tuberculosis, a crippling childhood disease, was curbed through the introduction of pasteurized milk in Montreal and Toronto at the turn of the century. This practice was soon followed by the dairy industry across Canada.

Bayer began marketing the wonder drug of the age, [[Aspirin]], in 1899. It was an instant success and quickly became popular in Canada. Originally sold as a powder, the tablet was introduced in 1914. A very important step in the mass production of medical products was taken that same year when Dr. John Fitzgerald founded an institution that would be named the [[Connaught Laboratories]] in 1917, at the University of Toronto. Initially the laboratories produced vaccines and antitoxins for smallpox, tetanus, diphtheria and rabies. In 1922 after the Nobel Prize winning work on Dr. Banting and Dr. Best the facility began to manufacture insulin.

In 1914 Dr. John Fitzgerald established laboratories in Toronto to produce vaccines for smallpox, rabies, diphtheria and tetanus. The facility was named the Connaught laboratories in 1917 in honour of Prince Albert, the Duke of Connaught the recently retired Governor General. Beginning in 1922 the laboratories began to mass-produce the newly discovered hormone [[insulin]].

The [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of municipal drinking water, a technique known to kill bacteria and thus make the water safer for human consumption, was introduced in Toronto in 1910. It became widely used across Canada in the years that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Drinking Water Management in Ontario: A Brief History, Ontario Sewer and Watermain Construction Association, January 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defence===
The 13- and 18-pound muzzle-loading gun field gun with modern recoil and sighting systems were acquired at the turn of the century. A notable acquisition was the first breech-loading gun, in Canadian use, the 13-pound quick-firing (Q.F.) and 18-pound Q.F. firing shrapnel and high-explosive rounds, in 1905. The [[Royal Canadian Navy]] founded in 1910, took possession of its first ships, two tired steel-hulled former Royal Navy cruisers, the ''Rainbow'', in 1910, stationed at Esquimalt on the west coast and the ''Niobe'' at Halifax on the east coast.

== The Automobile Age (1920–1950) ==

During the post-World War I era, a plethora of technologies were introduced, including the car, air service, air navigation, paved roads, radio, the telephone, refrigeration, wonder drugs and powered farming, mining and forestry equipment.

===Transportation, the car and aeroplane===
The [[Ford Motor Company of Canada]], founded in Windsor, Ontario in 1904, was the first major company to introduce the automobile to Canada. It manufactured cars in that city and was the first company to use the [[assembly line]] manufacturing technique in Canada. Facilities were established in the McGregor wagon factory in Walkerville (now part of Windsor), where the first vehicle off the line was a Model C. Production of the Model T was introduced in 1909 and by 1913 the company was manufacturing motors, the first [[internal combustion engines]] built in Canada, at the Windsor plant. A number of different types, all based on US designs, were manufactured including, the [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model-A]], Ford Model-C, Ford Model-K, Ford Model-N and [[Ford Model-T]]. During WWII, the Canadian Military Pattern Truck, was built there. Following the war, the Ford Meteor was assembled until production moved to the new Ford plant in Oakville in 1953, where production has continued until this day.

In 1918 the McLaughlin Motor Company, Ltd. of Oshawa, Ontario and the Chevrolet Motor Company of Canada Ltd. merged to form [[General Motors of Canada]] and became a subsidiary of the US-owned General Motors Corporation. The company manufactured Buicks, Oldsmobiles and Oaklands on its assembly line in Oshawa.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Heather, Driving Force, The McLaughlin Family and the Age of the Car, McClelland &amp; Stewart, Toronto, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Chrysler Canada]], established in Windsor, began vehicle assembly in that city in 1936. [[Studebaker Canada Ltd.]] manufactured cars and trucks at a plant in Hamilton, Ontario from 1947 to 1966.

The automobile was a hit with Canadians. In 1904 there were 535 cars in Ontario, by 1913 there were 50,000 in Canada, by 1916, 123,000, by 1922, 513,000 and by 1930, 1,076,000. Of note was Thomas Wilby's Trans-Canada road trip, the first by automobile across Canada, from Halifax to Victoria, in 1912, on a series of highways that became known as the All Red Route. As the car gained in popularity local automobile clubs were founded. In 1913 nine of these clubs from across the country got together to form the [[Canadian Automobile Association]].

Cars required [[gasoline]], and the first service station in Canada was built in Vancouver on Smythe Street in 1907. Most early stations were informal curb-side affairs, and it was not until the twenties that the filling station as we know it began to appear, with [[Imperial Oil]] building architect-designed stations for its customers. By 1928 Imperial had evolved three standard filling station designs for different locations: business district, urban residential and small town/leased property. In the 1920s, gasoline itself was modified by the addition of [[tetraethyllead]] to reduce premature detonation of the gas-air mixture in the cylinder, commonly described as knock, in [[internal combustion engines]]. Both health and environmental problems would later become associated with leaded gasoline.

The popularity of the car also had a dramatic impact on urban infrastructure and roads in particular. The dirt, gravel, tar and occasionally cobblestone that characterized most city roads was inadequate for the automobile and towns and cities and provinces across Canada began paving projects creating roads of asphalt and concrete that were more suitable. The [[traffic light]] was also introduced to help regulate the congestion that began to arise in the twenties especially in larger cities like Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. The first in Canada was installed at the corner of Bloor St. and Yonge St. in Toronto in 1925.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Guillet, Edwin C., The Story of Canadian Roads, University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The operation of cars on the newly paved roads in a snowy climate necessitated the use of a technology for keeping roads clear for cars in winter. Municipalities and provinces acquired [[snowplow]]s, fleets of trucks with steel blades attached to the front bumper to clear city and provincial roads. The use of crushed rock salt for melting snow and ice on roads was also introduced during this period. The technique was effective but unfortunately proved to be very corrosive to steel and concrete. This had serious consequences for the undercarriage of the steel vehicles that used the roads in winter as well as the roads themselves along with bridges and parking lots.

The popularity of the car in urban areas also lead to the introduction of the [[parking meter]] in the centre of most urban areas. Invented in the US in 1935 it progressively found its way onto city streets across Canada in the years that followed.

The car began to compete with the [[streetcar]] in the thirties and forties and many cities reduced or abandoned this service. New suburbs were built without streetcar lines and urban diesel powered buses were used to provide public transport. Only a handful of cities continued to maintain streetcar service into the fifties and beyond, most notably Toronto which to this day has a very elaborate public streetcar network.

The auto-craze gave rise to a booming do-it-yourself car maintenance and repair movement with businesses specializing in car parts and tools becoming popular. One of the notable firm in this field, the familiar, [[Canadian Tire]], began operations in Toronto in 1922 and has become one of Canada's largest retailers.

Long distance travel by aircraft became increasingly important and practical in the postwar years. Taking off in a Vickers Vimy IV bomber from Lester's Field in St. Johns, Newfoundland on 14 June 1919, John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown, ([[Alcock and Brown]]) made the first trans-Atlantic flight, crash landing in Ireland 16 hours later. The first cross-Canada flight began in Halifax on 7 October 1920 and ended in Vancouver ten days later.

In the twenties and thirties the Canadian north was developed with the help of hundreds of small float equipped "bush planes" used to fly men and supplies to mining, forestry, trapping and fishing camps. The first commercial air passenger flight in Canada was made in 1920, when two bush pilots flew a fur buyer from Winnipeg to The Pas, Manitoba.   National passenger air service was introduced  by [[Trans-Canada Airlines]] beginning in 1937 and [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] starting in 1942.

Of note was the attempt by Britain to establish an airship service between that country and Canada and a related test flight by the British built dirigible the [[R-100]] was made in July 1930. After a successful crossing of the Atlantic the giant craft moored at a mast especially constructed for that purpose at St. Hubert near Montreal. The ship flew on to Toronto before finally returning to Britain. However, technical problems with the craft prevented further flights and the idea of a Trans-Atlantic lighter-than-air passenger service was abandoned.

To facilitate the development of a national aviation service the Government of Canada created a kind of national highway in the sky called the Trans-Canada Airway consisting of airports, radio and weather services and lighting for night flying, at various locations across Canada. Construction started in 1929 but was slowed by the depression. The western leg from Vancouver to Winnipeg was completed in 1938. The section from Winnipeg to Toronto and Montreal was inaugurated in 1939 and the extensions to Moncton, Halifax and St. John's completed in 1940, 1941 and 1942 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Milberry, Larry, Aviation in Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Toronto, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communications, radio===
In 1901, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] sent radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean. He established a machine to produce electromagnetic waves at Cornwall in England and a machine to detect these waves at Signal Hill in St. John's Newfoundland. On 12 December 1901 he announced that he had received the transmission of waves sent by the transmitter in England at the station in St John’s.&lt;ref&gt;Babaian, Sharon, A., Radio Communication in Canada : An Historical and Technological Survey, The Transformation Series, No. 1, National Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa, Canada, 1992, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;    
 
In Montreal, in 1920, XWA ([[CINW (AM)]]) became the first commercial [[AM radio]] broadcaster in the world. Both the AM transmitter and receiver used analog technology. The following year CKAC became the first French- language AM radio broadcaster in Canada. State operated national radio broadcasting chains were established beginning in the late 1920s, including the CNR National Radio Network, 1927, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission Radio Network, 1932 and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] Radio Network, 1936. Private independent AM broadcast operations sprouted like mushrooms in cities large and small across Canada during the thirties and forties. Canadian Marconi Company ([[CMC Electronics]]) formed in Montreal in 1903 and [[Nortel|Northern Electric]], manufactured radios for home use, the first mass-produced electronic equipment in Canada. The circuits of these devises were based on analog technology.

The [[teleprinter]] became a popular technology with telegraph companies beginning in 1922. When used with the telegraph system it permitted the automated printing of thousands of telegraph messages and became the backbone of the telegram service offered by the Canadian National Telegraph Company formed in 1920 and the Canadian Pacific Telegraph Company.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Robert, A Voice from Afar, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Toronto, 1977, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[wirephoto]], was introduced in the US by Associated Press in 1935. This technology permitted the transmission of a photograph by use of telephone wires and became widely used by newspapers for reporting purposes. The technology was quickly introduced to Canada by Canadian Press (1917), which provided the service to newspapers across the country. Canadian Press also became the exclusive provider of Canadian wirephotos for Associated Press.

The Canadian film industry experienced mixed success during the twenties and thirties. Film maker Ernest Shipman produced five features between 1920 and 1923 before meeting with financial failure. The successful Canadian-owned Allen Theatre chain attained an important place in the exhibition market before being taken over by Famous Players Canadian Corporation ([[Cineplex Entertainment]]) in 1923. The technology of the talking cinema or "talkies" was introduced to Canada in 1927 by that company to take advantage of the arrival of talking films produced in Hollywood. The first Canadian "talkie" was "The Viking", an adventure story about sealing off the coast of Newfoundland, produced in 1931.

[[Associated Screen News of Canada]] in Montreal produced two notable newsreel series, "Kinograms" in the twenties and "Canadian Cameo" from 1932 to 1953. The regular production of short films by the newly created Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau began in the 1930s. British law encouraging filmmaking in the Commonwealth led Hollywood to circumvent the spirit of the concept by establishing film production companies to make American films in Calgary, Toronto, Montreal and Victoria. These companies produced a small number of features but closed operations when the British law was changed to exclude their films. In 1941, Odeon Theatres of Canada opened a new cinema chain to compete with Famous Players.

The making of documentary films grew tremendously during World War II with the creation of the [[National Film Board of Canada]] in 1939. By 1945 it was one of the major film production studios in the world with a staff of nearly 800 and over 500 films to its credit, including the very popular ''The World in Action'' and ''Canada Carries On'' series of monthly propaganda films.

===Materials===
[[Plastics]] were also introduced during these years. In Toronto, Plastics Ltd. began to produce Bakelite soon after its invention in 1909. Another firm, Canadian Electro Products of Shawinigan, Quebec, invented [[polyvinyl acetate]] which was used in copolymer resins and water-based paints. The wartime production of nitrocellulose naturally led to the manufacture at Shawinigan in 1932, of transparent cellulose film used for packaging. What is now called [[fibreglass]] was invented in the US in 1938 at [[Owens-Corning]] by [[Russell Games Slayter]] and introduced to Canada shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Warrington, Newbold, Chemical Canada: Past and Present, The Chemical Institute of Canada, Ottawa, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;
    
[[Aluminum]] also became popular. In 1902, attracted by the availability of cheap hydro power, the Aluminum Company of America established a Canadian subsidiary, the Northern Aluminum Company ([[Alcan]]) at Shawinigan Falls, Quebec to produce that metal using the electrolysis technique. Corporate changes led to the creation of the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan) in 1925 and in 1926 the company constructed a giant aluminum smelter at a place it named Arvida, Quebec. Once again the site was chosen for the availability of cheap hydro electricity and the proximity of a deep-water port at Bagotville for large ships carrying bauxite or aluminum ore. World War II accelerated the demand for aluminum, which was the principal material in aircraft production and the Arvida facility was greatly expanded. In 1958 another huge Alcan smelter was built at Kitimat, British Columbia.

The growth in popularity of the car also created a need for rubber for automobile tires. Accelerated by the emergency of World War II, a substantial [[synthetic rubber]] production industry was established at Sarnia, Ontario in the early forties. The oil refineries there provided a ready source of raw materials. In particular, the Suspensiod crackers operated there by Imperial Oil produced large quantities of hydrocarbon gases. These were used by a new Crown enterprise, [[Polymer Corporation]] created in 1942, and associated private companies, St. Clair Processing Corporation Ltd., Dow Chemical of Canada Ltd., and Canadian Synthetic Rubber Ltd., itself a subsidiary of four Canadian rubber companies, Dominion, Firestone, Goodyear and Goodrich, to produce both GR-S and butyl type synthetic rubber. Initially production was destined for wartime use on military vehicles but in postwar years output was quickly redirected to civilian automobile production.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The closely related synthetic textile industry appeared in the years just after the First War. The production of artificial silk, more properly known as viscose [[rayon]], made from bleached wood pulp, began in Cornwall, Ontario in 1925, in a factory built by [[Courtaulds]] (Canada). A year later [[Celanese]] Canada began making acetate yarn in a new plant in Drummondville, Quebec. [[DuPont]] Canada was the first to manufacture [[nylon]] yarn in Canada at its factory in Kingston, Ontario in 1942. This secret material was initially used for parachutes but following the war was used to make nylon stockings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Asbestos]] has long been known for its fibrous and heat resistant properties. With the rise of the automobile, asbestos became an important material, being used to make brakes. The world's largest asbestos mine, the Jeffrey Mine in Asbestos, Quebec had its beginnings in the 1878 when a local farmer W. H. Jeffrey began to mine the substance there. Original mining methods were primitive and involved blasting, the use of chisels to remove the mineral from the rock by hand and a crane powered by one horse. By 1895, 2300 tons of asbestos were being removed from the open pit mine per year. The mine was purchased by the Johns-Manville Company of the US in 1918 and has since become the largest asbestos mine in the world, over two kilometres in diameter and 350 metres deep. The material was used for insulation in buildings and ships and, of course, for automobile brakes. However, serious health problems, including lung cancer, have been associated with its mining and use, and in recent years mining activity there has diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Kuyek,  Asbestos Mining in Canada:
A brief presented to the International Ban Asbestos Conference,
Ottawa, September 13, 2003,  MiningWatch Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
With the rail building era coming to an end, the rise of the [[automotive industry]] in southern Ontario provided the Hamilton steel mills of the Steel Company of Canada and the Dominion Foundries and Steel Company with a new market. Dofasco introduced the [[basic oxygen steelmaking]] at its mills in Hamilton in 1954. In the latter part of the century, Algoma, in Sault Ste. Marie, built coke oven batteries and blast furnaces, while phasing out the open-hearth and Bessemer steel-making process in favour of the basic oxygen steel-making.

The industrial production of [[bread]] became notable during these years. At the beginning of the 20th century it is estimated that only about 8% of Canadian wives bought bread commercially. However, the industrial production of bread grew impressively and by the 1960s, 95% of homemakers purchased bread commercially. One bakery of note, The Canada Bread Company Limited, was founded in 1911 as the result of the amalgamation of five smaller companies. Industrial bakeries such as this were characterized by the use of large machines for the mixing of dough, which was placed in pans on slow moving conveyor belts that transported them through giant ovens, where they were baked. Large automated packaging machines wrapped the finished loaves at great speed. Improvements in transportation and packaging technology throughout the decades allowed a shrinking number of bakeries to serve every larger markets. In 1939 there were about 3200 commercial bakeries across the country but by 1973 the figure stood at 1700, while in 1981 there were 1400.

[[Meat packing]] grew to become Canada's most important food processing industry during this period. In Calgary, Alberta, in 1890, Pat Burns established P. Burns and Company, which became the largest meat processor in western Canada. In Toronto in 1896 the innovative Harris Abbatoir was established to export chilled sides of beef to the British market. The industry grew rapidly during the war, supplying meat to Canadian and British troops overseas. However, it underwent a period of consolidation in the twenties due to a loss of markets. This led to the merger of two major players, William Davies and the Harris Abattoir, to form [[Canada Packers]] in Toronto. By 1930, "The Big Three", meat packers in Canada were Canada Packers, Swift Canadian and P.Burns and Company in Calgary, Alberta.

The increasing popularity of the electric [[refrigerator]] in Canadian restaurants and homes made it practical for manufacturers to make available various [[frozen foods]]. The first such offering, a frozen strawberry pack was produced in Montreal and Ottawa beginning in 1932 by Heeney Frosted Foods Ltd.

===Consumer technology===
Cold [[breakfast cereal]] became increasingly popular during these years. Wheat and later corn flakes were developed in the US by the Kellogg brothers in 1894 and the Kellogg Company was formed in 1906. In London, Ontario the Canadian Corn Company purchased the rights to manufacture and distribute Toasted Corn Flakes for Canadian distribution. In 1924 the American Kellogg Company purchased the London operation and formed Kellogg Canada Inc. Since that time the company has manufactured and distributed in Canada a wide variety of breakfast cereals including Corn Flakes, 1907, Bran Flakes, 1915, All Bran, 1916 and Rice Krispies, 1928.

Although neither the tin can nor soups were remarkable in any way in the thirties, the combination of the two in the form of the well known Campbell’s soup was very popular. The [[Campbell Soup Company]] introduced its soup products to Canada in 1930, making them at its factory in Toronto on the lake shore.

[[Instant coffee]] was another tasty innovation introduced during these years. The inventor and world leader in the manufacture of instant coffee, the Swiss-based [[Nestlé]] Company began operations in Canada with the production of canned condensed milk at its plant, The Maple Leaf Condensed Milk Company, in Chesterville, Ontario in 1918. Head office research invented instant coffee and began selling it around the world including Canada, as Nescafe in 1938. It became hugely popular with allied troops during World War II. In 1952 the instant chocolate drink, Nestle Quik, was introduced to Canada.

The [[sanitary napkin]] and [[Kleenex]] brand facial tissue were introduced in the 1920s. Kimberly, Clark and Co. ([[Kimberly Clark]]) formed in the US in 1872, invented cellucotton in 1914. It used this material as the basis for a sanitary napkin and marketed the product as [[Kotex]] beginning in 1920. Kleenex, initially intended for the removal of face cream, was introduced in 1924. In 1925 the company formed what would become, Canadian Cellucotton Products Limited, for the marketing of these and other products in Canada and internationally. The first practical electric [[razor]], the Sunbeam "Shavemaster" and the Remington "Close Shaver" made available in the US in 1937 and in Canada shortly thereafter.

With a base of [[caustic soda]], the world's first oven cleaner, [[Easy-Off]], was invented in Regina in 1932 by Herbert McCool and manufactured in his home in that city until 1946, when production shifted to Iberville, Quebec. The product has since become the most popular oven cleaner in the world.

=== Architecture ===
The grand hotel continued to make a mark with new structures, including the Bigwinn Inn, Muskoka, Ontario, 1920, the [[Jasper Park Lodge]], Jasper, Alberta, 1922, the Hotel Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, 1926, the Hotel Saskatchewan, Regina, Saskatchewan, 1927, the Prince of Wales Hotel, Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, 1927, the Lord Nelson Hotel, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1928, The Pines, Digby, Nova Scotia, 1929, the [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]], Toronto, 1929, the [[Chateau Montebello]], Montebello, Quebec, 1930, the Nova Scotian Hotel, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1930, the Charlottetown Hotel, Charlottetown, P.E.I. and the Bessborough Hotel, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, 1935.

In 1875 in Montreal, a McGill student, J. Creighton, established the basic rules for [[hockey]] as we know it today. The world's first facility dedicated to hockey, the Westmount Arena was built in Montreal in 1898 while the first industrial refrigeration equipment for making artificial ice in Canada was installed in 1911 by Frank and Lester Patrick for their new arenas in Vancouver and Victoria. The [[Mutual Street Arena]], with its artificial ice surface, was built in Toronto in 1912. With the development of wide span roof structures the construction of large indoor ice rink stadiums became possible. These two technologies were used to build the [[Montreal Forum]], home of the legendary [[Montreal Canadiens]] hockey team, in Montreal in 1924 and [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] home of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], in that city in 1931. Baseball's facilities were upgraded with construction of the new [[Maple Leaf Stadium]] on [[Lake Shore Boulevard]] in Toronto in 1926 and the De Lormier Downs Stadium (Hector Racine Stadium), in Montreal in 1927. Civic Stadium, now Ivor Wynne Stadium, was built in Hamilton, Ontario in 1930, to host the British Empire Games held there that year.

The construction of the very large, [[Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré]], near Quebec city was completed in 1926.

There were also advances in the lighting of public, commercial and industrial buildings. In 1938, after decades of development in  the US and Europe, General Electric in the US, and shortly thereafter Westinghouse, began to sell the [[fluorescent lamp]]. Because of its lower power consumption its use was quickly adopted for large-scale applications. These lights were quickly made available to the Canadian market through the Canadian subsidiaries of these two companies.

===Civil engineering and public works===
Notable engineering works of the period included the [[Second Narrows Bridge]], Vancouver, 1925, the R.C. Harris Filtration Plant, Toronto, Ontario, 1926, the [[Peace Bridge]], Fort Erie, Ontario, 1927, the [[Champlain Bridge (Ottawa)]], 1928, the Ocean Terminals, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1928, Sea Island Airport ([[Vancouver International Airport]]), Vancouver, 1929, the [[Ambassador Bridge]], Windsor-Detroit, 1929, the [[Windsor-Detroit Tunnel]], 1930, the [[Broadway Bridge (Saskatoon)|Broadway Bridge]], Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, 1932, the [[Île d'Orléans Bridge]], near Quebec City, 1934, the [[Thousand Islands Bridge]], Ontario, 1937, the [[Pattullo Bridge]], Vancouver, 1937, the [[Lion's Gate Bridge]], Vancouver, British Columbia, 1938, Malton Airport ([[Toronto Pearson International Airport]]), Toronto, 1938, the [[Blue Water Bridge]], Sarnia, Ontario, 1938, the [[Queen Elizabeth Way]], Ontario, 1939, the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)]], 1941, Dorval Airport, ([[Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport]]), Montreal, 1941 and the [[Alaska Highway]], Dawson Creek, British Columbia, 1942.

Canada’s first major [[roller coaster]] the [[Crystal Beach Cyclone]] was built at the Crystal Beach Amusement park in 1927. It quickly gained a reputation for its wild and even violent ride and one passenger, Amos Wiedrich was killed in 1938 when he stood up to take off his coat while the coaster was in motion.

The [[dump truck]] and [[bulldozer]] were introduced during these years for a variety of earth moving tasks including road building and canal construction. The dump truck was invented in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1920 by Robert T. Mawhinney and the bulldozer was developed in the US in 1923. Both quickly became popular worldwide.

===Medicine===
Medical treatment benefited from the introduction of the [[electrocardiograph]], used to diagnose heart problems, in large hospitals in the late twenties. There were also important innovations with respect to the treatment of epilepsy during this period. In Montreal, Dr. Wilder Penfield, with a grant from the US Rockefeller Foundation, founded the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]] at the [[Royal Victoria Hospital (Montreal)]], in 1934 to study and treat epilepsy and other neurological diseases.

===Defence and nuclear technology===
The military suffered a huge decline in the 1920s and 1930s. The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] founded in 1924, was largely a bush and float plane operation. Only in the 1930s did it acquire a modest combat capability with a handful of British [[Armstrong Whitworth Siskin]] fighters and a squadron of [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters as the clouds of war grew menacing. The [[Royal Canadian Navy]], perpetually starved for equipment acquired its first custom-built ships, the destroyers [[HMCS Saguenay (D79)]] and [[HMCS Skeena (D59)]] on May 22, 1931. In 1929 the army began to retire its horses and was issued four 6-wheeled Leyland tractors in 1929, to tow its 60-pound guns. Four 3-inch 20-cwt. anti-aircraft guns were taken on strength in 1937. As a reflection of this intense and diverse engineering activity, the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers was established in 1936. This organization was renamed [[Engineers Canada]] in 2007.

Canada was involved in the wartime [[Manhattan Project]] to build an atomic bomb, including the [[Montreal Laboratory]] for nuclear research by scientists from Britain, and American contracts with Canadian firms [[Eldorado Gold Mines]] for mining and processing uranium and a heavy water plant built by Consolidated Mining and Smelting (CMS) at [[Trail, British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== The Television Age (1950–1980) ==

The years following World War II introduced even more innovations, including television, the transistor radio, synthetic fabrics, plastic, computers, super highways, shopping centres, atomic energy, nuclear weapons, transcontinental energy pipelines, long range electric transmission, transcontinental microwave networks, fast food, chemical fertilizer, insecticides, the birth control pill, jet aircraft, cable TV, colour TV, the instant replay, the audio cartridge and audio cassette, satellite communications and continental air defence systems.

===Communications (television and the transistor radio)===

In the early 1980s Canadian Satellite Communications (Cancom) assembled a package of Canadian and American television channels which it offered to remote communities throughout the northern regions of Canada. The signals were distributed by Anik satellite and made available to the local populace through cable. By the later part of the decade several hundred communities were using this service.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, E. Austin, The Struggle for National Broadcasting in Canada, McClelland &amp; Stewart, Toronto, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also technological innovation in the telephone system. The first trans-Atlantic telephone cable, jointly owned by the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation, British Post Office and AT&amp;T, was brought into service in 1956, paving the way for telephone calls from Canada to Britain and Europe. An improved cable, CANTAT was installed in 1961. A similar service on the west coast, [[COMPAC]], the [[Commonwealth Pacific Cable System]] was inaugurated in 1963, linking Canada by undersea telephone cable with New Zealand and Australia. CN/CP Telecommunications introduced the well known Telex service to Canada in 1956. Direct distance dialing was initiated in Canada in 1958, beginning with customers in Toronto and on 1 July of that year the [[Trans-Canada Microwave]] system, known as the Trans-Canada Skyway, went into service.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Robert, A Voice from Afar: The History of Telecommunications in Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, 1977, pp. 292–295.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept and operation of a dedicated [[emergency telephone number]] originated in Canada, where the City of Winnipeg established the world's first [[9-1-1]] service in 1959. The service eventually spread and was offered continent wide.

===Communications (satellites)===

The [[Anik (satellite)]] series of communications satellites initially built by Hughes Aircraft and operated by [[Telesat Canada]] starting in 1972 formed the basis of the world's first domestic satellite communications service. Telesat has launched a large number of satellites including, Anik A1 - 1972, Anik A2 - 1973, Anik A3 - 1975, Anik B - 1978, Anik D1 - 1982, Anik C3 - 1982, Anik C2 - 1983, Anik D2 - 1984, Anik C1 - 1985, Anik E2 - 1991, Anik E1 - 1991, MSAT - 1996, Nimiq 1 - 1999, Anik F1 - 2000, Nimiq 2 - 2002, Anik F2 - 2004, Anik F1R - 2005, and Anik F3 - 2007.

"Dataroute", the world's first national digital data system was introduced by CN/CP in 1973.

===Nuclear weapons===
After considerable political turmoil Canada acquired [[nuclear weapons]] from the Americans under a "dual key" arrangement on 1 January 1963. Genie air-to-air rockets armed with atomic warheads were based at RCAF Stations Comox, British Columbia, Bagotville, Quebec, and Chatham, New Brunswick, as the primary weapon for the newly acquired CF-101 interceptor. The nuclear armed [[BOMARC]] (Boeing Michigan Air Research Corporation) anti-aircraft missile was based at RCAF Stations North Bay, Ontario, and Lamacaza, Quebec. In Germany, as part of Canada's NATO commitment, nuclear free-fall bombs were acquired for the RCAF CF-104 strike fighter and the Canadian Army in Germany took possession of a battery of  [[MGR-1 Honest John|Honest John]] surface-to-surface battlefield rockets armed with nuclear warheads. By 1984 all these atomic weapons had been returned to the United States.

While there were no accidents involving nuclear weapons in Canadian hands, there were at least two involving USAF aircraft flying in Canadian airspace. On 14 February 1950 a USAF B-36 heavy bomber, serial 44-92075, carrying one Mark 4 (Fat Man type) atomic bomb experienced multiple engine failures while flying south off the coast of British Columbia and jettisoned the bomb over Squally Channel. The crew bailed out and the plane flew on autopilot for another 330&amp;nbsp;km before crashing on a mountainside in the Kispiox Valley. In eastern Canada on 10 November 1950, a USAF B-50 heavy bomber, serial 46-038, flying from Goose Bay, Labrador, to the United States, experienced engine trouble and in accordance with standard operating procedures, jettisoned the Mark 4 atomic bomb it was carrying over the St. Lawrence River, near Rivière-du-Loup. The bomb's own 2200&amp;nbsp;kg conventional explosives blew it apart before it hit the water. The plane flew on to a base in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Clearwater, John, Canadian Nuclear Weapons: The Untold Story of Canada's Cold War Arsenal, Dundurn, Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computers===
[[Computers]] were introduced in a variety of areas at this time. The [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council Canada]] experimented with fire-control computers towards the end of the war. The University of Toronto Computer Centre, established in 1947, developed Canada’s first operational computer the University of Toronto Electronic Computer ([[UTEC]]) in 1951. This was followed by the purchase of FERUT (Ferranti University of Toronto) computer, by the Computer Centre in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Eggleston, Wilfred, National Research in Canada: The NRC 1916–1966, Clarke Irwin, Toronto, 1978, pp 412–418.&lt;/ref&gt; The NRC used this computer in the early fifties for the hydrographic modeling of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] then under construction. Computers were also developed by other organizations, including the National Research Council, the NRC Computer (1954–1960), Ferranti Canada, mail sorter (1955), Computing Devices of Canada, the "Kicksorter" (1957–1963), the Defence Research Board, the DRTE (1960) and Sperry Canada, UMAC-5 (1962). [[Avro Canada]] in Toronto worked unsuccessfully to develop the fire-control computer for the [[Velvet Glove]] air-to-air missile for the highly advanced but ill-fated [[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow]] interceptor. [[Avro Canada]] made extensive use of computers in calculations for aircraft design and manufacturing processes, including [[Numerical control|CNC]].  Other military developers included the Royal Canadian Navy with its [[DATAR]] system for the command and control of warships.

In the 1950s the Pinetree, Mid-Canada and DEW Line air-defence radar chains built across Canada relied heavily on computers. Certainly the largest and most powerful computer in Canada at the time was the IBM/USAF developed [[AN/FSQ-7]], installed in the late 1950s, {{convert|700|ft|m}} underground at RCAF Station North Bay, as the "brain" of the DEW Line System. The machine contained 55,000 vacuum tubes, weighed 275 tons and occupied a half-acre of floor space. It could perform 75,000 instructions per second.
 
By 1958 there were 41 computers in operation in Canada with big business, universities or the military. The most popular was the [[IBM 650]], which was used by 19 organizations, including Canadair Limited, Canadian General Electric, Ford Motor Company of Canada, Great West Life Assurance Company, Imperial Oil Limited, Orenda Engines Limited and the University of Toronto. Other models in use included the [[Bendix G-15]], 4, the [[ALWAC III-E]], 3, the [[IBM 705]], 3, the [[UNIVAC II]], 3, the [[Datatron|Datatron 205]], 2, the [[LGP-30]], 2, the Borroughs E 101, 1, the [[IBM 704]], 1, and the NRC 102A/D.&lt;ref&gt;Stachniak, Zbigniew, Campbell, Scott C., Computing in Canada, Transformation Series, No. 17, Canada Science and Technology Museum2009, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first commercial users of computers was [[Trans-Canada Airlines]] (TCA). In 1961 Ferranti-Packard developed the [[ReserVec]] computer reservation system for TCA (now [[Air Canada]]). This formed the basis for the [[Ferranti-Packard 6000]] computer, and in 1963 two were sold in Canada, one to the Defence Research Establishment Atlantic, in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia and the other to the Toronto Stock Exchange.

In 1961 the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] was the first bank in Canada to introduce computers for its operations, followed by the [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] in 1962. It was soon followed by the other large Canadian banks, including the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] and [[Bank of Nova Scotia]]. When they introduced the [[credit card]] about the same time these records were kept on large central computers as well. It was this experience with large computer systems linking hundreds of branch offices across the country that enabled the banks to introduce the [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] and the [[debit card]], across Canada in the 1980s. Computers were also introduced to control complex industrial processes.  Interprovincial Pipe Line Limited of Edmonton was one of the first Canadian companies to employ computers as a means of controlling the flow of gas in its very large pipeline system. [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] used computers to control atomic fission in its power reactors. In 1977 the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] became the first stock market in the world convert to electronic trading with the introduction of the its Computer Assisted Trading System. Twenty years later, in 1997, the exchange closed its trading floor and converted to a fully automated, computer-driven trading system.

Computers were also recognized as a tool for policing. The [[Canadian Police Information Centre]] which was established in 1966 under the auspices of the RCMP, has operated, since that date, a national computer data base that provides information relating to criminal activity in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Police Information Centre www.cpic-cipc.ca/English/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period [[Canada Post]] applied computer readable codes to speed the delivery of mail. On 1 April 1971 the postal code system was introduced. The technique involved the use of a six-character geographic code placed on the envelope or parcel by the sender. The code was in turn machine scanned by a computer-driven optical reader that signaled the sorting equipment to direct the item to the proper destination. While technically effective, the introduction of the system lead to serious labour trouble at Canada Post for several years by unionized workers who were afraid of pay cuts or job loss ([[Postal codes in Canada]]).

===Transportation===
In transportation, several significant works were completed, including the [[Toronto Subway]], 1954, the Trans-Canada Gas Pipeline, 1958, the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]], 1959, [[Trans-Canada Highway]], completed in 1962, the [[Montreal Subway]], 1966, [[GO Transit]], Toronto area, 1967 and [[Highway 401]], Ontario, completed in 1968.

On August 10, 1949, the [[Avro Canada C102 Jetliner]], a mid-range four-engine passenger jet, made its first flight, just 13 days after the world's first and eight years before the US's first, the [[Boeing 707]].  Trans-Canada Airlines (later [[Air Canada]]) and [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] introduced jet passenger service with the [[de Havilland Comet]], DC-8, DC9, B727 and B-737. The B-747 was introduced by these companies in the early seventies. In the sixties and early seventies De Havilland Aircraft of Canada in Toronto developed the [[DHC-7 Dash 7]] and DHC-8 Dash 8 [[STOL]] aircraft. These were used to provide passenger service to small city centre airports in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. A number of international carriers also acquired these aircraft to provide similar services elsewhere in the world. The first Canadian owned [[helicopter]] began operation in Canada on 12 March 1947. On that date Photographic Survey Corporation took possession of a Bell Bell 47B-3, registration CF-FJA.&lt;ref&gt;Milberry, Larry, Aviation in Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Toronto, 1979, p.242.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of trans-oceanic aviation in the postwar years created a need for accurate weather information over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. An international agreement in 1946 established 13 Ocean Weather Stations with Canada being responsible for two, ocean station Baker several hundred miles off the east coast from 1947 to 1950 and for ocean station Papa {{convert|900|mi|km}} off the coast of Vancouver from 1950 to 1981. A number of ships, both converted RCN vessels and purpose built CCG weather ships were stationed at these points to gather weather information during these years. Ships involved included, HMCS St. Stephen, HMCS St. Catherines, HMCS Stone Town, CCGS Vancouver, and CCGS Quadra.

Of note was the transit of the Northwest Passage in 1954 by [[HMCS Labrador]], Canada's first purpose built icebreaker, which was acquired that same year, in service with the Royal Canadian Navy.

Of particular significance was the conversion from steam to diesel by Canada's two great railways. Beginning in the mid fifties the CPR and Canadian National Railways began replacing their steam locomotives with diesel locomotives. By 1960 the conversion was mostly complete.

The [[Volkswagen]] was introduced to Canadians in 1952 and became very popular with drivers who wanted greater fuel economy than that provided by the larger cars then on the market. It was sold in Canada until 1977. The seat belt became a standard feature of domestic passenger cars in the late sixties. The [[catalytic converter]] was also introduced during these years. The first devices, designed to reduce air pollution from automobile exhaust, were installed in the 1975 model year for US cars manufactured in Canada. Because of environmental concerns and the fact that it was not compatible with these converters, the major gasoline companies in Canada began to eliminate the sale of [[leaded gasoline]] that same year.

Although Armand Bombardier invented the [[snowmobile]], the initial production model, the B-7 dating from 1937 was a large 7 passenger vehicle. It was not until 1959 with the development of the small gas engine that the individual snowmobile or Ski-doo was produced by Bombardier ([[Bombardier Recreational Products]]) in the company factory at Valcourt, Quebec. A number of competitors in Canada and elsewhere entered the market and sales of snowmobiles skyrocketed with 2 million being sold worldwide between 1970 and 1973. To this day, snowmobiles remain popular in Canada and other regions with snowy winters.

Pedestrian walkways have become important features of some Canadian cities. Climate controlled underground passageways and shopping malls have been features of the downtown cores of Toronto ([[PATH (Toronto)]]) and Montreal ([[Underground City, Montreal]]) since the mid-sixties. Arguable the most unusual, is the [[Plus 15]] system in downtown Calgary. Initiated in 1970 it presently consists of 57 bridges and 16&amp;nbsp;km of enclosed climate controlled passageways suspended {{convert|15|ft|m}} above ground level which permit pedestrians to walk anywhere in the downtown core summer or winter without ever going outside.

===Atomic energy===
Beginning in the mid-1950s nuclear-generated electricity was developed under a partnership of industry and government at both the federal and provincial levels. A [[NPD reactor|demonstration power reactor, the NPD]] was built at Rolphton, Ontario in 1962, followed by a commercial-scale [[CANDU]] prototype at Douglas Point in 1968.  In 1971 electricity became commercially available from the large (ultimately 8-unit) Pickering station near Toronto, Ontario and, starting in 1977, the Bruce station (ultimately 8-units as well), near Kinkardine, Ontario. These were followed by the Gentilly-2 Atomic Electric Plant, Trois-Rivières, Quebec and the Point Lepreau Atomic Electric Plant, Point Lepreau, New Brunswick both in 1982. The electric current supplied by commercial hydro companies to consumers was changed and organizations like Hydro Ontario converted from 25 cycles to 60 cycles during the ten-year period from 1949 to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Eggleston, Wilfred, Canada's Nuclear Story, Clarke Irwin, Toronto, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of this technology was not without mishap. On 12 December 1952 the experimental NRX reactor at Chalk River suffered a failure of its cooling system and underwent a partial meltdown. On May 24, 1958, the newly commissioned NRU reactor also a Chalk River experienced a major accident when one of the uranium filled fuel rods caught fire and seriously contaminated the reactor building with radioactive debris.

===Energy (oil and gas)===
The modern era of oil production in Canada began in 1947 when Imperial made its major discovery at Leduc, Alberta. The availability of oil and gas in Alberta, a half continent away from central Canada provided the impetus for the construction of two huge transcontinental pipelines to the eastern Canadian market. The crude oil pipeline was the first to be built. The construction of first section of the Interprovincial Pipeline from Edmonton to Regina to Superior Wisconsin in the US began in 1950 and was completed in an astonishing 150 days. In 1953 the pipeline was extended through the US to Sarnia, Ontario and from Sarnia to Toronto in 1957. At the time of its completion it was the longest pipeline in the world. The oil and gasoline industry has grown tremendously since then, mainly to meet the demand for gasoline created by the popularity of the car and for home heating oil. Major [[oil refineries]] have been built in Vancouver, British Columbia, Edmonton, Alberta, Sarnia, Ontario, Montreal, Quebec and Saint John, New Brunswick.

The construction of the transcontinental oil pipeline was followed by that of the gas carrying Trans-Canada pipeline. Work began in 1956 at the Alberta/Saskatchewan border advancing to Regina, Winnipeg and Port Arthur, Ontario in 1957. Construction was not without mishap as during a pressure test in 1957 five kilometres of pipe blew up near Dryden, Ontario. The line crossed the very technically difficult Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior and reached Toronto and Montreal in 1958.  At the time of its completion it was the longest pipeline in the world. Political controversies related to the construction of the pipeline contributed to the fall of the St. Laurent Liberal government in 1957. 
Gas pipelines were also built in Alberta, the largest being that of Alberta Gas Trunk Lines, incorporated in 1954 and British Columbia, where the [[Westcoast Transmission Co.]] system was completed in 1957. While large pipelines carried natural gas across the continent smaller distribution systems were necessary to carry gas into factories and individual homes, where it was used as a source of heat. Very complex local understreet pipeline networks were constructed in cities across Canada to meet this requirement.

Other energy projects of the period included  the Lakeview Generating Station, Mississauga, Ontario, 1962, the W.A.C.Bennett (hydro) Dam, British Columbia, 1967, the Gardiner (hydro) Dam, Saskatchewan, 1968, the Churchill Falls Hydro Dam, Labrador, 1971, the [[Nanticoke Generating Station]] (largest coal-fired plant in North America), Nanticoke, Ontario, 1978 and La Grande 2 Hydro Dam, Quebec, 1979. The energy crisis of 1973 had domestic repercussions with many consumers taking steps to reduce energy costs through the installation of improved home insulation and wood burning stoves.

The existence in Alberta of large quantities of surface bitumen (oil) mixed with sand has been known for many years. In the late 1970s the commercial production of [[synthetic crude]] oil from this bitumen began near Fort McMurray. Construction at this site, by a company known as [[Syncrude]], began in 1973 and the first crude oil was produced there in 1978. The complex and costly production process involves scraping the sticky bitumen-laden sand from the surface, transporting it to a processing facility, removing the sand from the bitumen and upgrading the bitumen to a product known as light sweet crude. The technical scale of the operation is very large. Initially the sandy tar-like bitumen was scrapped from the ground using gigantic powered rotating mechanical wheels equipped with scraping buckets and the [[oil sand]] was placed on conveyor belts for transport to the processing plant. However, the severely cold Albert winters caused the continuous breakdown of the machinery and a new technique was developed. This involves the use of gigantic power shovels and dumptrucks to deliver the bitumen laden sand to the processing plant. Once at the plant the bitumen is removed from the sand with a process that involves the use of hot water. The bitumen is then subjected to fluid coking, [[hydroprocessing]], hydrotreating and reblending. Syncrude is the largest producer of synthetic crude oil from bitumen sand in the world and the largest producer of oil from a single site in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, Canadian Oil Sands Trust, Annual Report, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
The forestry industry underwent a notable process of mechanization in the postwar years. The most visible change was the introduction of the [[chain saw]]. When originally developed for modern use in the 1920s, this heavy, gasoline engine-driven machine required two men for its operation. However, improvements in engine technology eventually made the saw small and light enough to be operated easily by one person. In 1944 one of the first industrial users, [[Bloedel, Stewart and Welch|Bloedel Stewart and Welch Ltd]]. in British Columbia had 112 chain saws in operation, but their use accounted for only a small part of total forestry tree cutting. In 1950 less than one percent of pulpwood in Canada was cut with chain saws. However, by 1955 this figure had grown to more than 50%.

Other machines were also introduced during this period. The first [[feller buncher]] was used by the Quebec North Shore Paper Company in 1957. Hydraulic tree shears were first used in 1966 by the Abitibi Pulp and Paper Company Limited ([[Abitibi-Consolidated]]). Snowmobiles and tracked machines replaced animals for the hauling of logs. In 1948 several Bombardier machines were employed to this end by the Ste. Anne Power Company Limited in Quebec. In 1959 Timberland Machines of Woodstock, Ontario developed the Timberbuncher, a self-propelled machine which could move through the forest, cut a whole tree at its base (a process known as full tree harvesting) and, using a hydraulic arm, place it into a pile for hauling. Machines that stripped the branches from felled trees, a process known as delimbing, were also introduced at this time.

With the help of these technologies, the Canadian [[pulp and paper industry]] grew to become one of the major suppliers of newsprint in the world through the operations of companies such as [[MacMillan Bloedel Limited]], Repap Enterprises Inc., Kruger Inc., Great Lakes Forest Products Ltd, [[British Columbia Forest Products|British Columbia Forest Products Ltd.]], Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., [[Canadian Forest Products|Canadian Forest Products Ltd.]], CIP Inc., Domtar Pulp &amp; Paper Products Group and Abitibi Consolidated.

The use of [[pesticides]] was a prominent feature of postwar agriculture across Canada. Insecticides based on fluorine, arsenic, rotenone, nicotine pyrethrum as well as herbicides using sulphiric acid, arsenites and salt and finally fungicides based on sulphur, mercury or copper have been very effective in controlling life forms that degrade agricultural output. At the same time these compounds have also had a negative effect beyond their intended sphere of use. [[DDT]] was registered for use in Canada from 1946 until 1985, when its use was banned. The product was never manufactured in Canada. [[Food irradiation]], in particular the irradiation of potatoes to prevent sprouting while in storage, was approved for use in Canada in 1960.

Potash-based [[chemical fertilizer]] became an important element of increased agricultural production in Canada and around the world in the postwar era. In Saskatchewan techniques were introduced for the mining of the huge potash deposits found there. These involve both "dry" and "wet", methods of mining. The dry method involves the sinking of a vertical shaft and the use of large powered cutting machines to cut into the potash horizontally. The wet technique known as solution mining is used to access potash at greater depths. This involves drilling a vertical hole into the deposit into which is pumped hot water. The liquid dissolves the potash underground and then returns to the surface, where another process separates the mineral from the water.&lt;ref&gt;web site, Western Potash Corp. www.westernpotash.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Office automation===
Business administration underwent technological change. The [[ball point pen]] was marketed in the US in October 1945 and in Canada shortly thereafter. The [[IBM Selectric typewriter]], introduced in 1961, quickly became popular with businesses in Canada, as did the [[Xerox]] photocopier in the 1960s.

===Medicine===
There was important progress in medical technology during this period. In 1945 Dr. Stuart Stanbury established a National Blood Transfusion Programme for the [[Canadian Red Cross Society]], thus making available to those in need, a dependable source of blood for medical purposes. The associated test for blood typing was introduced at the same time. Blood tests would become increasingly sophisticated in the coming years. The [[electroencephalograph]], used for the diagnosis of neurological disorders was introduced in major Canadian medical institutions in the late forties.

The techniques for the mass production and distribution of vaccines and for the mass public inoculation were introduced during these years. Polio was a disease that affected large numbers of Canadian children during the first part of the 20th century. In the US, research by Dr. Jonas Salk in the late 1940s led to the discovery of vaccine for the prevention of this disease. However, there was no technique for volume manufacture of the drug. Connaught Laboratories of Toronto developed a synthetic culture known as "medium 199", which enabled the mass production of this [[polio vaccine]] beginning in 1952. A successful all-Canadian mass inoculation of children using the new vaccine was undertaken in the spring of 1955, the first such mass public health campaign of its type in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Rutty, Christopher J., Connaught and the Canadian Polio Vaccine Story, CONNTACT, Vol. 9, No. 3 June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antibiotics]] such as penicillin were quickly made available to the general public in the postwar years.

There was also progress with respect to the treatment of heart disease. The [[pacemaker]] invented with significant Canadian participation was used to treat patients with arrhythmia. For more serious problems [[open heart surgery]] became an option for patients and permitted the repair of faulty heart valves, the clearing of blocked coronary arteries and the resolution of other problems. Canada's first [[heart transplant]] was performed on 31 May 1968, by Dr. Pierre Godin the Chief Surgeon at the Montreal Heart Institute, on patient Albert Murphy of Chomedy, Quebec a 59-year-old retired butcher suffering from degenerative heart disease. The operation took place about six months after the world's first, by Dr. Christian Barnard.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, CBC Digital Archives, www.archives.cbc.ca/on_this_day/05/31/.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neurosurgery]] was introduced in a substantive way in the 1960s.

Cancer patients were provided with a new option, [[radiation therapy]], through what was popularly known as the "Cobalt Bomb", again developed with important Canadian input. The use of [[radio isotopes]] for diagnostics was also introduced. [[Chemotherapy]] also became a treatment option. In 1960 the use of a subcutaneous arteriovenous shunt along with the artificial kidney machine allowed [[hemodialysis]] for patients with chronic renal failure.

During these years the Montreal Neurological Institute pioneered the development of medical imaging technologies introducing Canada's first [[Computed axial tomography|CAT]] scan in 1973, [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scan in 1975 and [[MRI]] in 1982. The technique of [[medical ultrasonography]] also became widely available beginning in the late 1960s and was especially popular with expectant mothers interested in the health and sex of their fetus. The number of these machines in use has grown greatly over the years. In 2004 there were about 150 MRI units and about 350 CAT units in use in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release CIHI, "CIHI report shows increase in MRI and CT scanners, up more than 75% in the last decade." Medical Imaging in Canada, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The corneal [[contact lenses]] first developed in 1949 gained mass appeal in Canada and elsewhere in the 1960s. Made of [[polymethyl methacrylate]] (PMMA) they could be worn up to 16 hours a day.

Developments in [[orthodontics]] made the straightening of the teeth of children with "braces" commonplace. Children were also often on the receiving end of the tonsillectomy a fashionable surgical procedure during these years.

The surgical replacement of body parts also became possible and was used to treat ailing kidneys and joints such as knees and hips. The availability of cosmetic implants became popular during these years. In 1962, in the US, Dow Corning developed the silicone gel-filled [[breast implant]] which was used by women for surgical breast augmentation. The procedure was common in Canada. In recent years implants containing saline solution have also become popular.

Pharmaceuticals attained a high-profile. The availability of the [[birth control pill]] in 1960 made it possible for women to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy. Stress could be treated with [[tranquilizers]], such as valium, introduced in 1963. The consumption of [[vitamins]]  became widespread and supplements were added to staple foods such as milk and bread and were taken in pill form. While most of these drugs were safe, one, [[thalidomide]], had horrific consequences for its users. Thalidomide was invented in West Germany in 1954 by Chemie Grunenthal as a sedative. It was noted that the drug was particularly effective in treating the symptoms of morning sickness associated with pregnancy. The drug was made available under prescription to Canadians beginning 1 April 1961. Tragically it was discovered that the drug caused miscarriage and severe birth defects.  As a result, the drug was withdrawn from the Canadian market on 2 March 1962.&lt;ref&gt;web site, www.thalidomide.ca, Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada,&lt;/ref&gt;

The "recreational" use of "soft drugs" such a [[marijuana]], [[LSD]] and [[hashish]] became part of the 1960s counter culture.  Marijuana was often produced locally using the hydroponic method.

===Domestic and consumer technology (in the home)===
The car, cheap gasoline and postwar affluence created boom conditions for the expansion of [[suburbia]]. Several standard designs for the single family home on a standard lot were reproduced cookie-cutter style row-upon-row in cities across Canada as subdivision after subdivision sprang up radiating from the central core. The designs were thoroughly modern, reflecting the optimism of the era, usually with a peaked roof, asphalt shingles and a brick or wood siding exterior and included a living room, kitchen and occasionally dining room and two, three or four bedrooms and a full basement made of poured concrete or cinder block. Floors were usually made of varnished hardwood planks and the walls and ceilings of gyprock. Copper piping brought running water from the serviced street and copper wiring electricity from the rear lot line. Clay tile pipe carried the sewage from the flush, sit toilet to the main sewer line running under the street. There was usually a driveway beside the house for the family car, and less frequently a carport or garage.

Most homes were equipped with a telephone often with a "party" line but these became rare by the 1960s. A television set was also common in almost all homes by the end of the 1950s and the record player gave way to the hi-fi stereo. Almost all kitchens were equipped with electric refrigerators and electric or less commonly gas, stoves.  Where there was gas it was usually piped to the home through a main line running under the street. There were a variety of electrical "labour saving" devices including electrical mixers can openers and carving knives. Central heating was a standard feature and coal, delivered to the home by a diesel powered truck, was the dominant fuel source in the early postwar years. However, as the 1950s progressed coal gave way to oil and gas heating. Home furnishings were almost all mass-produced and made from wood, fabric and various types of stuffing for cushions. In the kitchen metal chrome tube chairs and formica topped tables were popular. The small front and back yard were maintained with the help of a gasoline-powered lawn mower, and the hedge and bushes were trimmed with electric clippers. In the early 1960s the high-rise apartment building began to make its appearance in large cities. The self-supporting steel structures were usually seven stories or more, and large buildings contained hundreds of dwelling units. Initially they were especially visible along Highway 401 in Toronto, Metropolitan Boulevard in Montreal and the north shore of English Bay in Vancouver. Their construction was possible due to the introduction of the high-rise crane, which to this day remains a common feature of city skylines.

The arrival of television had an effect on eating habits. In 1953, C.A. Swanson &amp; Sons introduced the [[TV dinner]] to the US market. The pre-cooked food items, including, meat, potatoes and a vegetable were placed in the segments of an aluminum tray and frozen. The consumer purchased the frozen product and heated it in the oven for about 25 minutes. It could be eaten out of the tray.  In 1960, Swanson, a subsidiary of the Campbell Soup Company, built a factory in Listowel, Ontario to manufacture TV dinners and other Campbell frozen products for the Canadian market. The [[electric toothbrush]] introduced in 1959 has become very popular in Canada since the 1990s.

The steel [[aerosol spray]] can with the gas propellant, and "crimp on nozzle" was developed in the US in 1949. It quickly became a favored type of packaging in Canada for a number of products including whipped cream, deodorant, bug spray and hair spray. The gas propellant, usually a [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC), became a target for environmental concern in the 1970s when research demonstrated that it had a harmful effect on the ozone layer in the atmosphere. The international [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1989 banned the use of these substances and they were subsequently replaced with volatile [[hydrocarbons]]. The disposable [[diaper]] was introduced to the Canadian market in 1972 by [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] Canada Ltd. The chemistry of hair colouring was introduced to the domestic scene in the US and Canada in 1956, when [[Clairol]] began marketing a home hair colouring kit for women that could be purchased for a modest price at a local pharmacy or grocery store. Invented in Canada, the green plastic garbage bag ([[Bin bag]]) was introduced to Canadians in the late 1960s. Patented in 1955 by Swiss engineer, [[George de Mestral]], [[velcro]], a two sided fastening technology based on hooks and loops, was introduced to a number of countries, including Canada, in the late 1950s. In Montreal, Velek Ltd. acquired the exclusive marketing rights for velcro in North and South America and Japan.

The format for sound recordings changed in the years just following the war. In the US, [[Columbia Records]] introduced the long playing (LP) 33{{frac|1|3}} format in 1948. Columbia made an agreement with [[Sparton Records]], of London, Ontario, established in 1930, for the manufacture and distribution of its LP records in Canada. Not to be caught short, [[RCA Victor]] in the US responded in 1949 with its own technological innovation the 45 rpm record (with the big hole in the centre) and manufactured and distributed this new format for the Canadian market through its Canadian subsidiary, RCA Victor of Canada, established in Montreal in 1929. The video home system ([[VHS]]) released in 1976 by [[Victor Company of Japan, Limited]] (JVC), quickly became popular in Canada and was used to record TV programmes or to play VHS tapes of Hollywood movies that could be rented in neighborhood video stores that soon became a common feature of suburban strip malls. In 2003 the popularity of DVD surpassed VHS and by 2006 the technology had become obsolete.

The introduction of the [[credit card]] complimented the appearance of the shopping mall. In 1968 a number of Canadian banks including the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Royal Bank of Canada, the Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce began issuing the [[Chargex]] credit card to customers. In 1977 these cards were reissued by the same banks under the [[VISA]] brand name. The [[MasterCard]] credit card became available to Canadians in 1973.

===Domestic and consumer technology (in the Suburbs)===

The booming growth of the suburbs led to the appearance of the [[shopping mall]], a low-rise steel frame, commercial structure housing a number of retail outlets and surrounded by acres of asphalt parking lot for large numbers of cars. The first in Canada included the Norgate Shopping Centre, Saint-Laurent, Quebec, 1949, the Dorval Shopping Centre, Dorval, Quebec, 1950, the Park Royal Shopping Centre, West Vancouver, British Columbia, 1950, the Sunnybrook Plaza, Toronto, 1951 and York Mills, Toronto, 1952.

The hospitality industry was similarly affected and [[fast food]] drive-in restaurants began to appear. In 1951 the first St. Hubert BBQ restaurant opened its doors on St-Hubert street in Montreal. A&amp;W opened its first Canadian operation in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1957. In 1959 [[Harvey's]] opened its first eatery on Yonge Street in Richmond Hill. In Hamilton, Ontario, the  first [[Tim Hortons]] restaurant opened in 1964. The first McDonald's restaurant outside the United States was opened in Richmond, British Columbia in 1967 and Pizza Delight was founded in Shediac, New Brunswick, in 1968.

Cinema attendance boomed after the war and with it innovations in cinema design. The first double-screen cinema, The Elgin, opened its doors in Ottawa in 1946 and the [[drive-in cinema]] became popular after the war. However, the long cold Canadian winters discouraged the widespread diffusion of this type of film exhibition. The dramatic [[IMAX]] large-scale cinema format was invented as the result of developments in cinematic technology during Expo '67 in Montreal. The world's first permanent Imax cinema, Cinesphere, was built at [[Ontario Place (theme park)|Ontario Place]] in Toronto in 1971. Others were built in Vancouver for Expo '86 and at the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] in Gatineau, Quebec, in 1989. By 1995 there were 129 Imax cinemas entertaining audiences around the world. The audio cartridge and audio cassette became popular in the early 1970s with the cassette eventually winning the battle of the formats. This compact medium led to the appearance of high quality in-car sound systems.

The New [[Woodbine Racetrack]] for thoroughbred horse racing opened to the public in Toronto in 1956 (simply Woodbine after 1963) replacing the original Woodbine which was built in 1874. Canada’s first purpose-built auto racing track, the [[Westwood Motorsport Park]] was built in Coquitlam, British Columbia in 1959. The [[Mosport International Raceway]], north of Bowmanville, Ontario opened to the public in 1961 and hosted the Canadian Grand Prix Formula 1 races from 1967 to 1977. [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde]] became Canada’s largest amusement park when it opened in 1967 as part of [[Expo '67]] in Montreal. It is popular to this day for a number of roller coasters, including The Boomerang, [[Cobra (La Ronde)|Cobra]], [[Goliath (La Ronde)|Goliath]], [[Le Monstre]] and [[Vampire (La Ronde)|Vampire]].

===Materials===
[[Detergent]], a replacement for soap, introduced in the postwar years, was used to keep clothes and dishes clean through the action of its active ingredient, tetrapropylene, a derivative of petroleum. The popular Tide brand became available in 1948. In 1964 [[permanent press]] fabrics were invented in the US by Ruth Rogan Benerito, a scientist at the Physical Chemistry Research Group of the Cotton Chemical Reactions Laboratory and introduced to Canada shortly thereafter. The press resulted from the treatment of the fabric with formaldehyde. Invented by DuPont scientist Dr. Roy J. Plunkett in 1938,  [[polytetrafluoroethylene]], a polymer considered the world’s most slippery substance, was introduced commercially as [[Teflon]], in 1946 in the US. It is used in a wide variety of applications, including as a non-stick coating on the cooking surface of pots and pans and is manufactured in Canada by DuPont in Mississauga, Ontario. Krazy Glue ([[ethyl cyanoacrylate]]) was introduced to Canada in 1973.

===Waste disposal and sewage treatment===
In the postwar years Canadian municipalities began treating raw sewage, which up to that time, with a few notable exceptions, had been allowed to flow directly from their sewer systems into nearby streams, rivers, lakes and oceans. New facilities were added in Toronto including the Highland Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1956 and the Humber Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1960. Vancouver built a number of sewage treatment facilities including the Lions Gate Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1961, the Iona Island Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1963 and the Lulu Island Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1973. The City of Ottawa built the Green's Creek Pollution Control Center (now Robert O. Pickard Environmental Centre) in 1961. In 1970 the City of Montreal began the construction of a large sewer network which channeled all effluent to the treatment plant at Rivière-des-Prairies on the east end of the island and became operational in 1996. By 1980, 64% of Canadians were served by sewage treatment, with the figure rising to 78% in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, OECD, www.environmentalindicators.com/htdocs/indicators/7muni.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Public and industrial concern with air pollution and [[acid rain]] led to measures being taken by a number of companies to cut back on harmful atmospheric emissions. In 1972, [[Vale Inco|Inco]] undertook steps to reduce emissions of SO2 and other gases by installing scrubbers and a {{convert|1250|ft|m|adj=on}} chimney at its Copper Cliff smelter in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, Vale Inco, www.inco.com/business/history/#&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public works and civil engineering ===

Bridges of note included the [[Angus L. Macdonald Bridge]] in Halifax 1954, the [[Oak Street Bridge]], Vancouver, 1957, the [[Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway]], 1958, [[Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge]], 1960, the [[Queensborough Bridge]], Vancouver 1960, the [[Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge]], Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, 1962, the [[Champlain Bridge, Montreal]], 1962, the [[Lewiston-Queenston Bridge]], Niagara Falls, Ontario, 1962, the [[Port Mann Bridge]], Vancouver, 1964, the [[Macdonald-Cartier Bridge]], Ottawa, 1965, the [[Pont de la Concorde (Montreal)]], 1966, the [[Prince Edward Viaduct]], Toronto 1966, the [[Laviolette Bridge]], Trois-Rivières, Quebec, 1967, the [[Saint John Harbour Bridge]], Saint John, New Brunswick, 1968, the [[Dinsmore Bridge]], Vancouver, 1969, the [[A. Murray McKay Bridge]], Halifax, 1970, the [[Pierre Laporte Bridge]], Quebec City, 1970, the [[Portage Bridge]], Ottawa, 1973 and the [[Arthur Laing Bridge]], Vancouver, 1976.

This was also an era of gigantism, and there were both successes and failures. Beginning in 1963, massive civil engineering works were undertaken in the St. Lawrence River in Montreal to build the site for the 1967 World's Fair, known as [[Expo 67]].  The gigantic [[Red River Floodway]], which opened in 1968, was designed to carry flood water from a rising Red River around the heart of the City of Winnipeg. It was completed in 1968 and proved successful when used for the first time in 1969. At the time of its completion it was the second largest earth-moving project in the world, after the Panama Canal.

Northwest of Montreal thousands of acres of fertile farmland were expropriated to build the huge new [[Mirabel International Airport]], which opened in 1975. The facility was to be linked to the heart of Montreal with a fast train. The train was never built and both passengers and air carriers stayed away in droves. The site eventually became a quiet industrial airport, home to the production facilities for Bombardier regional jets. On the other hand, the [[James Bay Project]] undertaken in Quebec at the same time was a booming success. Several large dams on the La Grande River with their associated long distance transmission lines provide Hydro-Québec with an important source of electricity.

The [[CN Tower]], the world's tallest free-standing structure, was constructed in Toronto in 1975.

===Architecture===

Important skyscrapers, including [[Place Ville Marie]] (Royal Bank), Montreal, 1962, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Tower, Montreal, 1962, the Edifice Trust Royal (C.I.L. House), Montreal, 1962, the Toronto Dominion Bank Tower, Toronto, 1967, The Simpson Tower, Toronto, 1968, the Hôtel Château Champlain, Montreal, 1967, the Royal Trust Tower, Toronto, 1969, Royal Centre, Vancouver, 1972, [[Inco Superstack]], Sudbury, Ontario, 1972, [[First Canadian Place]], Toronto, 1975, Harbour Centre,  Vancouver, 1976, the Complexe Desjardins, la Tour du Sud, Montreal, 1976, the Scotia Tower, Calgary, 1976, the Scotia Tower, Vancouver, 1977, Royal Bank Plaza, South Tower, Toronto, 1977 and the First Bank Tower, Toronto, 1979, represented significant architectural achievements during this period.

The massive [[Saint Joseph's Oratory]], the largest church in Canada, the construction of which began in 1924, was completed in 1967 on the north slope of Mont Royal in Montreal.

Notable large sports facilities included, Empire Stadium, Vancouver, 1954, [[McMahon Stadium]], Calgary, Alberta, 1960, the Montreal Automobile Stadium (Autostad) 1966, the [[Olympic Stadium]], Montreal, 1976 and [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)]], 1978.

== The PC Age (1980–2000) ==

[[Microelectronics]] became a part of everyday life during this period. The [[personal computer]] became a feature of most homes, and the microchip found its way into a bewildering variety of products from cars to washing machines.

===The microchip and digital computing===
In 1977 the first commercially produced personal computers were invented in the US: the Apple II, the PET 2001 and the TRS-80. They were quickly made available in Canada. In 1980 IBM introduced the IBM PC. Microsoft provided the operating system, through IBM, where it was referred to as PC&amp;nbsp;DOS and as a stand-alone product known as MS-DOS. This created a rivalry for personal computer operating systems, Apple and Microsoft, which endures to this day. A large variety of special-use software and applications have been developed for use with these operating systems. There have also been a multiplicity of hardware manufacturers which have produced a wide variety of personal computers, and the heart of these machines, the central processing unit, has increased in speed and capacity by leaps and bounds. There were 1,560,000 [[personal computers]] in Canada by 1987, of which 650,000 were in homes, 610,000 in businesses and 300,000 in educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;web site, The Canadian Encyclopedia, www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com, Computer Industry&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian producers of micro-computers included Sidus Systems, 3D Microcomputers, Seanix Technology and [[MDG Computers]]. Of note is the fact that these machines were based on digital technology, and their widespread and rapid introduction to Canada at the same time that the telephone system was undergoing a similar transformation would herald an era of rapid technological advance in the field of communication and computing.

The [[laptop computer]] also appeared during these years and achieved notable popularity in Canada beginning in the 1990s. In 1981 the first commercially available portable computer, the [[Osborne 1]], became available. Other models followed, including the [[Kaypro II]] in 1982, the popular [[Compaq Portable]] and Tandy Corporation [[TRS-80 Model 100]] both in 1983, the IBM PC Convertible, 1986, the [[Macintosh Portable]], 1989 and Power Book, 1991. The latter models in particular were popular with both professionals and consumers.

In the 1970s and 1980s [[word processing]], a method for "typing" documents using a keyboard linked to a computer and a video screen, was developed. Early machines were dedicated exclusively to this function and a notable Canadian contribution, the Superplus IV, produced by AES Data in Montreal in 1981, became widely popular. However, the rise of the personal computer and the invention of PC-compatible word processing software, such as [[WordPerfect]] in 1982 and [[Microsoft Word]] in 1983, made stand-alone word processors obsolete. [[Spreadsheet]] software also became popular for accounting purposes, notably [[Microsoft Excel]], which was also introduced to the world and Canadian market in 1983. These new machines with their new software quickly dominated the market and became an almost universal feature of any Canadian office.

===Supercomputers===

In 1987 there were considerable numbers of larger computers in Canada, including 25,000 mainframe and mini-computers. But the most powerful of all were the [[supercomputers]]. The [[Meteorological Service of Canada]] has been a noted user of large computers and has pioneered the Canadian use of supercomputers. Machines used have included the Bendix G20, 1962, an IBM 360-95 scientific mainframe computer, 1967, its first supercomputer a CDC 7600 from Control Data Corporation, 1973, a Cray 1S supercomputer, 1983, a NEC supercomputer, 1993 and an IBM supercomputer in 2003. At the time of its installation this latter machine was the most powerful computer in Canada.

The Communications Security Establishment (CSE), Canada's "electronic spy" agency has been a notable user of supercomputers. CSE code breaking capabilities degraded substantially in the 1960s and 1970s but were upgraded with the acquisition of a  Cray X-MP/11 (modified) supercomputer delivered to the Sir Leonard Tilley Building in Ottawa, in March 1985. It was, at the time, the most powerful computer in Canada. In the early 1990s, the Establishment purchased a  Floating Point Systems FPS 522-EA supercomputer at a cost of $1,620,371. This machine was upgraded to a Cray S-MP superserver after Cray acquired Floating Point Systems in December 1991 and used the Folklore Operating System supplied by the NSA in the US.&lt;ref&gt;http://luxexumbra.blogspot.com/2008_06_01_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt; These machines are now retired. 
Little information is available on the types of computers used by the CSEC since then. However, Cray in the US has produced a number of improved supercomputers since then. These include the Cray SX-6, early 2000s, the [[Cray X1]], 2003 (development funded in part by the NSA), [[Cray XD1]], 2004, Cray XT3, [[Cray XT4]], 2006, Cray XMt, 2006 and Cray CX1, 2008. It is possible that some of these models have been used by the CSEC and are in use today.

In 2008, Canada’s most powerful research computer, an IBM supercomputer, was installed in Toronto. The $20 million machine, about the size of an SUV, can make 12.5 trillion computations per second and will be used for [[proteomics]] research by the Ontario Cancer Institute, the Princess Margaret Hospital (specializing in cancer) and the University Health Network. An IBM System x iData Plex supercomputer began operation at the University of Toronto in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Omar el Akkad, Monster Computer Roars to Life, The Globe and Mail, 18 June 2009, p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the supercomputer used by Environment Canada for weather forecasting remains the largest in Canada.

===Communications: digitization and fibre optics===
Canada's major telephone companies introduced [[digital technology]] and [[fibre optics]] during this period paving the way for more advanced business and customer telecommunications services.

In 1976 Nortel developed the first digital [[private branch exchange]] (PBX) in the world. That same year Nortel announced its "Digital World" project, which foresaw the development and market introduction of a complete family of digital switching, transmission and business communications systems.

In 1977 Bell Canada began to conduct a fibre optic field trial to residential customers in Montreal. The Manitoba Telephone System began to introduce fibre optics in that province beginning with customers in Elie, in 1981. In 1984 Sasktel, the provincially owned telephone company in Saskatchewan, completed the construction of a 3,268&amp;nbsp;km. long commercial fibre optics network to fifty-two communities in that province. In 1984 CNCP Telecommunications began the construction of a trans-Canada fibre optic network. By 2009, the national fibre optic system in Canada stretched 7000 kilometers across the country and included underwater fibre links to PEI (1985) and Newfoundland. Eight fibres are reserved for Trans-Canada traffic.

On 1 July 1985, Cantel and Bell Cellular began to offer cell phone service in Canada. They used a technical standard known as [[CDMA]], which was compatible with mobile phone systems in the US but not elsewhere in the world. The [[fax]] began to make its presence felt in offices across Canada in the early 1980s.

The ''Globe and Mail'' began to produce its contents in electronic form in 1979. A year later in 1980, in order to enable the daily distribution of the Toronto-based paper across the country, in a bid to become Canada's "national newspaper", it began the transmission of its contents via Anik Satellite to regional offices, where it was printed and distributed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globelink.ca/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bluetooth]] technology, developed in 1994 by Ericsson, was introduced to Canadian consumers at that time. The technique permits the very short range radio communication of Bluetooth equipped electronic devices with each other for the purposes of information transfer. It is designed to eliminate the need for wires and cables to connect such machines.

===Lasers===

The use of [[lasers]] became common throughout Canada during these years. The devices are usually found as components of larger systems.

Lasers are used in the field of telecommunications, where they are act as the modulated light sources for fibre optic systems. The high frequency of the pulsed beams of light they produce enables the transmission of large quantities of information and the absence of an electromagnetic field around the fiber optic cable lessens transmission loss and increases the security of the data. Lasers are also used in many mechanical manufacturing systems to start and stop processes, measure component size and monitor and maintain quality.

In public they are commonly found at the retail checkout counter, where they scan bar codes. They are also used to open and close doors for people and cars and are common in public washrooms, where they control the flow of water for taps and the flushing of urinals and toilettes.

Their use in medicine has been growing. They are used to "burn" plaque from clogged arteries, to remove the decayed portion of teeth in dental treatment and to treat vision problems related to retinal detachment and near sightedness ([[lasik surgery]]).

The [[Lidar]], a laser-based instrument, is used by meteorologists to determine the height of the cloud base.

===Transportation===
Smaller vehicles became popular in response to the oil crisis of 1973. In 1981 the [[Chrysler K platform]] introduced by that company formed the basis for the compact K-car. [[Front wheel drive]] was widely introduced to North America by the Big Three US automakers beginning in 1978, when the Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni, both with transverse mounted engines, became available. A wide variety of front wheel-drive-models were quickly offered to Canadians by other car makers. 
The [[air bag]] safety feature was introduced during these years. In the US, the 1973 model Oldsmobile Toronado was the first passenger car equipped with an air bag. Ford introduced air bags as an option in the Tempo in the US in 1984 and Crysler made them a standard feature in 1988. Air bags were made available in the Canadian market as this feature became available in US models.

The [[semi-trailer truck]] (18 wheeler), became the dominant vehicle on the heavily used [[Highway 401 (Ontario)]]. [[Containerization]], which had made headway in ocean shipping with the construction of terminals in Halifax, Montreal and Vancouver also led to the eventual elimination of the railway box car and began to make inroads in the trucking industry. [[Light rail]] systems were built in Edmonton, Alberta in 1978, Calgary, Alberta, in 1981 and Vancouver, British Columbia in 1986.

The [[Ontario Highway 407]] Express Toll Road (ETR), opened in Toronto in 1997 to ease the burden of traffic on Highway 401 which passes through the heart of the city to the south. Special technology is used to collect tolls without the use to toll booths. Regular users can equip their cars with a transponder that sends a signal to highway sensors when the vehicle enters and leaves the road. For those vehicles without a transponder, special electro-optical sensors read the number plate and a bill for the toll is sent to the vehicle owner in the mail.

In 1996 GM Canada introduced the [[OnStar]] service to Canadian and US customers who chose this option when purchasing a new car. Considered a safety feature, the service provides emergency services, vehicle diagnostics and directions to drivers on the road. It is based on GPS technology as well as [[CDMA]] mobile phone technology provided in Canada by Bell Mobility. There is a 24-hour emergency response centre in Oshawa for vehicles located in Canada.

In the 1990s, a national weather radar surveillance system for aviation and general use was established. The initial system, the [[Canadian weather radar network]], established by Environment Canada, became operational in 1997 and consisted of 18 weather radars using the 5 centimetre wavelength (C-Band) and one using the ten-centimeter wavelength (S-Band). In 1998 that organization received approval to add another 12 radars and to upgrade the system to the [[Pulse-Doppler radar]] standard.

Also in 1997 the responsibility for air traffic control in Canada was transferred from Transport Canada to [[Nav Canada]]. The very large and complex control system operated by that organization uses a number of technologies, including 1400 ground-based navigation aids, 46 radars and six [[Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast]] systems, which are based on global positioning technology.

Technological improvements have also enhanced rail safety during these years. These include a large number of incremental changes to elements of rolling stock including wheels, axles, trucks, couplers and brakes. There have also been improvements to tracks including continuous weld, concrete sleepers and switching techniques. Techniques of traffic control and communication have also been improved.&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Technologies, Transport Canada, Rail Safety Act Review Secretariat, July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
Bombardier's invention of a new class of aircraft, the [[regional jet]] or RJ, allowed airlines to introduce jet passenger service to smaller centres. The design of this machine was facilitated through the use of [[computer-aided design]] software. In 2009, Bombardier Aerospace of Montreal, in cooperation with the [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council Canada]] began using robots for the assembly of its aircraft.

[[Factory farming]] of pigs and chickens in particular became a prominent feature of agriculture during these years. Large numbers of these animals are crowded into very large barns with controlled environments in an effort to maximize their growth and hence profit for the farmer. The use of antibiotics to fight infection, as well as the use of growth hormones is common. The growth in the number of these farms has been dramatic. The Fraser Valley in British Columbia is home to the highest concentration of such farms in Canada and the number of farms there increased from 56 in 1991 to 146 in 2001.  The growth of [[genetically modified crops]] also became common. One of the most notable in this regard is [[canola]]. Developed in Canada from rapeseed during the 1970s by Keith Downey and Baldur Stefansson it is used to produce oil that is low in erucic acid and glucosinolate and has become a major cash crop in North America. A strain of canola with additional modification that made it resistant to herbicide was introduced in Canada in 1996.

===Robotics===
The use of computer-controlled [[robots]] in manufacturing ([[computer-aided manufacturing]]) as well as the closely associated, [[Just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] inventory management technique, were pioneered in Canada by the auto manufacturers, who introduced them to improve efficiency. They were put to use in new auto manufacturing plants built, by [[Honda of Canada Manufacturing|Honda Canada]] in Alliston, Ontario and [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada|Toyota Canada]] in Cambridge, Ontario (1988). The techniques of robotic assembly-line manufacturing have improved over the years. As of 2009 robots form the basis for automobile production in Canada with a number of facilities and companies using this technology, including (city, company, model):
* Alliston, Ontario; Honda, Acura CSX, Acura MDX, Civic; 
* Oshawa, Ontario, General Motors, Camaro, Chevrolet Impala; 
* Ingersoll, Ontario, General Motors (CAMI - GM Suzike), Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain; 
* Brampton, Ontario, Chrysler, Chrysler 300, Dodge Challenger, Dodge Charger;
* Windsor, Ontario, Chrysler/Volkswagen, Chrysler Town and Country, Dodge Grand Caravan, Volkswagen Routan;
* Oakville, Ontario, Ford, Edge, Grand Marquis, Lincoln MKX;
* Cambridge, Ontario, Toyota, Matrix, Corolla, Lexus RX;
* St. Thomas, Ontario, Ford, Crown Victoria, Lincoln Town Car and
* Woodstock, Ontario, Toyota, RAV4.

===Space technology: earth observation and geomatics===

[[Geomatics]], a term that originated in Canada, is a technique of computer-based mapping that integrates information from a variety of sources including, cartography, remote sensing (including images from RADARSAT), surveying, global satellite navigation systems, geodesy and photogrammetry. In the new century it has become an important tool used by Canadians in a variety of endeavours including, commerce, the environment, search and rescue, urban planning, defence and natural resource management among other things. The Geomatics Industry Association of Canada, founded in 1988, presently has a membership of more than 100 organizations.

During these years Canada's unmanned space programme included the first launching of a Canadian earth observation satellite, [[RADARSAT-1]] in 1995 and an improved version [[RADARSAT-2]] in 2007. Placed in polar orbits each of these satellites images almost the Earth's entire surface, every 24 days using a powerful synthetic aperture radar, SAR. The images have both operational and scientific applications and their data is of use in geology, hydrology, agriculture, cartography, forestry, climatology, urbanology, environmental studies, meteorology, oceanography and other fields. In 2009 the Canadian Space Agency announced a follow-up programme, [[RADARSAT Constellation]], which will see the launching of three earth observation satellites, in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively, working as a trio to provide complete coverage of Canada's land and ocean surfaces as well as 95% of the surface of the world every 24 hours.

===Energy, offshore oil and gas===
The technology for offshore oil and gas extraction was introduced to Canada during these years. The first of several projects off of Canada’s east coast was the massive [[Hibernia (oil field)|Hibernia]] platform, a [[gravity base structure]] (GBS), built in Bull Arm, Newfoundland in the early 1990s. The 1.2 million ton structure was towed into place, 315&amp;nbsp;km to the south east of St. John's, Newfoundland, over the Hibernia off-shore oil reservoir, where it was positioned resting on the ocean floor in 80 meters of water with its superstructure rising 50 meters above the surface of the sea.  In 1997 the facility began to pump oil from the sea bottom. The oil is stored in giant on-board tanks and continuously off-loaded by a fleet of dedicated shuttle tankers which transport it to the shore-based oil refinery at Come-by-Chance, Newfoundland.

The nearby [[Terra Nova (oil field)|Terra Nova]], 350&amp;nbsp;km off shore, began to produce oil in 2002. The platform itself rests on the ocean floor and pumps oil from the sea bottom. However, unlike the Hibernia facility, the oil flows directly into a [[Floating Production Storage and Offloading]] (FPSO) vessel, the [[Terra Nova FPSO]], where it is processed and stored. The oil in the storage tanks is then removed by a shuttle tanker. A third oil production facility in the same area, the [[White Rose (oil field)]], operated by Husky Petroleum, which began operation in 2005 also uses a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel, the [[SeaRose FPSO]].

Undersea pipelines, the first in Canada and part of the [[Sable Offshore Energy Project]] have been introduced to transport gas from undersea wells off the coast of Nova Scotia since 2000. Gas was discovered near Sable Island in 1979 with the first platform and well head installed in the Thebaud field in 1999. An on-shore gas treatment facility was built at Goldboro and connected to the wellhead with a 225&amp;nbsp;km long undersea pipeline and production began in 2000. Other fields have been connected via undersea pipeline including the North Triumph, Venture, Alma and South Venture.

Other notable energy works included, the ill-fated east coast [[Ocean Ranger]] drilling platform, which sank in a storm in 1982 with the loss of all aboard, the Nova Scotia Power Corporation tidal generating station, Annapolis, 1984 and the [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station]], Darlington, Ontario, 1990. The construction of large-scale hydro-electric plants far from electric markets lead to the introduction of techniques for long distance [[electric power transmission]]. These techniques were used at a number of sites, including the W.A.C Bennett hydro station in British Columbia in 1968, [[Churchill Falls]], Labrador, 1971 and the [[Robert-Bourassa generating station]], 1981, the [[La Grande-3 generating station]], 1984, the [[La Grande-4 generating station]], 1986 and the [[La Grande-2-A generating station]], 1992, all in Quebec.

===Biotechnology===

[[Biotechnology]] involves modifying living organisms to serve human goals. Biological techniques are derived from a number of sciences including, biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, botany, zoology, microbiology and embryology to name a few.  In 1987, a number of Canadian companies and university research organizations operating in the field of biotechnology established the Industrial Biotechnology Association of Canada, also known as BIOTECanada. In 2005, the industry consisted of companies offering biotechnologically based services and products in the following sectors: human health (262 firms), agriculture (89 firms), food processing (54 firms), environment (33 firms), bioinformatics (16 firms), natural resources (21 firms) and aquaculture (15 firms).&lt;ref&gt;''Biotechnology in Canada: A Technology Platform for Growth'', Conference Board of Canada, Decemober 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010 BIOTECanada had more than 250 members.

In 2005 noted bio-medical spenders on biotechnological research (research spending in millions of C$) included, Apotex Inc. (151.1), Pfizer Canada Inc. (147.5), GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (111.8), Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. (96.6), Biovail Corporation (88.9), AstraZeneca Canada Inc. (79.8) and Sanofi Pasteur Limited (76.6).&lt;ref&gt;RESEARCH, Canada's Top 100 Corporate R&amp;D List, Infosource Inc. 2006 (2/2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another product of biotechnology, [[genetically modified crops]], are grown throughout Canada. One of the most widely known, [[canola]] was developed in Canada through selective breeding in 1974. Canola oil is used in food products and in non-food items such as lipstick, candles, bio-fuels and newspaper ink. One of the largest suppliers of genetically modified seeds for food crops and animal feed in Canada is Monsanto Canada, established in Winnipeg in 1901.

===Medicine===
Medical treatment advanced during these years. The use of lasers and computers became important parts of medical treatment. Computers were essential in the development of new medical imaging devices such as the [[CAT scan]], [[positron emission tomography]] and the [[MRI]]. Minimally invasive surgery, also known as [[laparoscopic surgery]], reduced surgical damage to patients. Lasers were used with catheters for clearing blocked arteries and catheters with small cameras provided images of conditions inside the body. [[Coronary bypass surgery]] became commonplace. [[Laser eye surgery]] became popular in the 1990s and was used to improve visual acuity for the near-sighted. New chemical chemotherapy combinations helped prolong the lives of cancer patients. Techniques for the long-term application of medication through the use of a skin patch or implants appeared during these years.

A large number of medical drugs ([[List of bestselling drugs]]) for treating a wide variety of ailments such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, arthritis, allergies, anemia, depression, asthma, osteoporosis and diabetes, became available to Canadians during this period.

The techniques for blood collection, processing and transfusion came under severe criticism in Canada during the 1980s, and led to Canada's worst-ever public health crisis. Between 1980 and 1985, 2000 recipients of tainted blood provided by the [[Canadian Red Cross]] were infected with the [[HIV|HI virus]]. Between 1980 and 1990, 30,000 Canadian transfusion recipients were infected with [[hepatitis C]] from tainted blood. About 8000 of those who received bad blood have died or are expected to die as a result. An investigation known as the [[Royal Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada]] was launched in 1993 and issued its final report in 1997.

A private company, IVF Canada of Scarborough, was the first to begin offering [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) in Canada beginning in 1983. Since that date the company has recorded a number of Canadian "firsts" in this field, including the first IVF pregnancy, first IVF twins, the first IVF triplets and the first baby born from a frozen embryo.&lt;ref&gt;web site, IVF Canada, www.ivfcanada.com&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1998 male erectile difficulties could be treated with the use of [[Viagra]] and other medications.

===Domestic and consumer technology===
There were innovations in home design and construction during this period. Houses generally became bigger. New materials such as [[Vinyl siding|vinyl]] siding became common and often replaced more expensive brick for home exteriors. The car port and garage became widespread features and the latter was often located close to the curb, creating a rather crowded streetscape. The home [[dishwasher]] and the [[microwave oven]] were introduced. Large-screen televisions usually of the cathode ray or projection type were found in many homes. The [[Sony Walkman]], introduced in 1979, quickly gained popularity as a means for listening to music on the go. There were innovations in the field of domestic cuisine including the introduction of [[microwave popcorn]]. In 1981, the development of the susceptor bag (a paper bag impregnated with an aluminum-coated polyester film), allowed popcorn therein to be popped in a microwave oven without scorching.

The [[compact disc]] (CD) and the [[digital video disc]] (DVD) were introduced at this time. The CD, which appeared in 1982, became a favourite format for musical recordings. By 1986 most music stores in Canada had phased out the LP and replaced it with the CD. It was also used for other purposes including data storage in the form of the CD-ROM. A closely related format, the DVD, with greater storage capacity than the CD, was introduced in 1997. In 1986, Americ Disc of Drummondville, Quebec began to manufacture CDs and after 1997, DVDs and has become one of the largest suppliers of this product in North America. The infrared-based TV [[remote control]] became popular with Canadians in the early 1980s.

[[Video games]] have become a wildly popular form of entertainment especially for youth, since the 1980s. The earliest video game dated from 1947 and a number of devices were produced in the 1950s and 1960s. However, it was the development of the computer chip that led to their popularization. The coin-operated arcade game ''Pong'' introduced by [[Atari]] in 1972 was the first to become widely available. The next phase of development included the introduction in the mid-1970s of the home console, first with a hardwired game, but then complemented in 1977 by “plug and play”, which allowed the use of game cartridges for variety. Beginning in 1985 PC gaming became popular, exploiting the flexibility and increasing popularity of the personal computer. In 1989 [[Nintendo]] released its Game Boy, the first of the hand-held electronic games. Game imagery became more elaborate with the introduction of the 32-bit chip that was featured in the Sony [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] released in 1994. The 128-bit, sixth generation of video games was born with the introduction of the Sega [[Dreamcast]] in 1998. These technologies found a place in the Canadian consumer market from the moment of their introduction and Canadian companies have played a role in their development, with hardware makers like [[ATI Technologies]] developing high-powered video chips for game imagery and software companies developing a number of games.

[[Gore-Tex]], a breathable, waterproof textile, was patented in the US in 1980. Clothing made from this product and designed for outdoor all-weather, sporting, athletic and recreational activity  became available in Canada shortly thereafter.

The [[theme park]] became popular in the 1980s and the technology of thrill is the main attraction. In Toronto, [[Canada's Wonderland]], Canada’s largest, opened its doors to the public in 1981 and is now tied for second place in North America as the theme park with the most roller coasters ([[List of roller coasters at Canada's Wonderland]]). [[Galaxyland]] the world's largest indoor amusement park located in the [[West Edmonton Mall]] which opened in 1981 has garnered continent-wide attention. The most popular thrill ride, the [[Mindbender (Galaxyland)]] is the largest indoor triple-loop roller coaster in North America. The Drop of Doom was another featured attraction until closed in the early 2000s. The Mall's [[World Waterpark]], which opened in 1985 offers bathers a chance to cavort in the world’s largest indoor wave pool. The technology of auto racetrack design and construction has been put to good use in Montreal at the [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]], Canada’s premier auto race track and home of the [[Canadian Grand Prix]] Formula 1 motor car races since 1978. The [[slot machine]], so dear to gamblers, was introduced during this period. Casinos have been built in Windsor, [[Caesars Windsor]] 1994, Niagara Falls, [[Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort]] 1996 and Orillia, [[Casino Rama]] 1996, Ontario, Montreal, [[Montreal Casino]], Gatineau, [[Casino du Lac Leamy]] 1996 and Baie St. Paul, [[Casino de Charlevoix]] 1994,  Quebec, Halifax, [[Casino Nova Scotia]] 1995, Nova Scotia and in Vancouver, the [[River Rock Casino Resort]] 2006, British Columbia.

The world’s first [[automated teller machine]] (ATM) service was developed by the Sherwood Credit Union in Regina in 1977, at that institution’s North Albert Branch. Other Canadian financial institutions followed this lead and by the 1980s the ATM was available throughout Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Web Site, www.canadacool.com/COOLFACTS/SASKATCHEWAN/ReginaATM.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s the [[bar code]] became a familiar feature on consumer products ranging from food to clothes as did the bar code scanner at the retail checkout counter. These two technologies greatly improved the effectiveness of the check-out procedure and improved inventory management as well, through the associated computer accounting of stock. This was one of the factors leading to the technique of just-in-time inventory management for retail, commercial and industrial undertakings.

The payment of consumer purchases at the retail checkout counter through the use of an electronic debit card was introduced across Canada in 1994. Known as [[Interac]], the system allows the consumer to swipe his personal card and with the use of a [[personal identification number]] have the amount of the purchase electronically deducted from his or her bank account. The service has since become very popular.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Waste disposal, recycling===
Although the concept of recycling waste materials was not new, the [[Blue Box Recycling System]] for domestic refuse collection made the idea highly visible. Initially developed by Laidlaw Waste Systems for the Kitchener, Ontario, in 1983, it was introduced to Ontario municipalities in 1986, by Ontario Multi-Material Recycling Incorporated (OMMRI), and promoted by Nyle Ludolph, who became known as the Father of the Blue Box. The concept involved the use of blue plastic boxes which were distributed to home owners, who in turn filled them with recyclable refuse and placed them at curbside for weekly pickup. The refuse was taken to specially designed plants, where materials were sorted and recycled. The technique became popular in municipalities across Canada in the years that followed.&lt;ref&gt;web site, Pollution Probe, www.pollutionprobe.org/Reports/we%20recycle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years the municipal garbage dump evolved to become the sanitary landfill site. A number of technologies, including clay and plastic liners were used to contain the smell and [[leachate]]. The largest in Canada, the [[Keele Valley Landfill]] was operated by the City of Toronto from 1983 until 2002, when it was closed because it was full.

[[Chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs), the gas propellants used in aerosol spray cans, became a target for environmental concern in the 1970s and 1980s when research demonstrated that they had a harmful effect on the ozone layer in the atmosphere. The international [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1989 banned the use of these substances and they were subsequently replaced with volatile hydrocarbons.

The problem with choice to reuse is still not available. There are many products that don't need to be recycled for a hundred years, but are put out monthly.

===Architecture and civil engineering===
Large architectural works of note included BC Place, Vancouver, 1983, [[Petro-Canada Centre]], West Tower, Calgary, 1984, the [[West Edmonton Mall]], Edmonton, Alberta, 1986,  Scotia Plaza, Toronto 1988, the Canterra Tower, Calgary, 1988, the [[Sky Dome]], Toronto, 1989, Bankers Hall, Calgary, 1989, BCE Place–Canada Trust Tower, Toronto, 1990, the Bay Wellington Tower, Toronto, 1990, Tour du 1000 de la Gauchetière, Montreal, 1991, Tour IBM-Marathon, Montreal, 1992 and [[GM Place]], Vancouver, 1995.

New arenas for Canada's National Hockey League teams were built, including [[GM Place]], Vancouver, home of the [[Vancouver Canucks]] in 1995, the [[Corel Centre]] in Ottawa, home of the [[Ottawa Senators]] and [[Molson Centre]] in Montreal, new home of the Montreal Canadiens, both in 1996.

Significant new bridges included the [[Alex Fraser Bridge]], Vancouver, 1986, the [[Skybridge (TransLink)]], Vancouver, 1989 and the [[Confederation Bridge]], NB-PEI, 1997.

==End note==

In the earlier parts of Canada's history, the state often played a crucial role in the diffusion of these technologies, in some cases through a monopoly enterprise, in others with a private "partner". In more recent times the need for the role of the state has diminished in the presence of a larger private sector.

In the latter part of the 20th century there is evidence that Canadian values prefer public expenditures on social programmes at the expense of public spending on the maintenance and expansion of public technical infrastructure. This can be seen in the fact that in 2008 the Federation of Canadian Municipalities estimated that it would take $123 billion to restore and repair aging urban infrastructure across Canada.

'''Terminology''' is the study of terms and their use. '''Terms''' are [[word]]s and [[compound word]]s or multi-word expressions that in specific contexts are given specific meanings—these may deviate from the meanings the same words have in other contexts and in everyday language.{{clarify|date=June 2018|reason=An example and counterexample are needed.}}&lt;ref&gt;a word or expression that has a precise meaning in some uses or is peculiar to a science, art, profession, or subject.{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Term|accessdate=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terminology is a discipline that studies, among other things, the development of such terms and their interrelationships within a specialized domain. Terminology differs from [[lexicography]], as it involves the study of [[concept]]s, conceptual systems and their labels (''terms''), whereas lexicography studies words and their meanings.

Terminology is a discipline that systematically studies the "labelling or designating of concepts" particular to one or more subject fields or domains of human activity. It does this through the research and analysis of terms in context for the purpose of documenting and promoting consistent usage. Terminology can be limited to one or more languages (for example, "multilingual terminology" and "bilingual terminology"), or may have an [[interdisciplinarity]] focus on the use of terms in different fields.

==Overview==
The discipline of terminology consists primarily of the following aspects:

* analyzing the concepts and concept structures used in a field or domain of activity
* identifying the terms assigned to the concepts
* in the case of bilingual or multilingual terminology, establishing correspondences between terms in the various languages
* compiling the [[terminology (artifact)|terminology]], on paper or in [[database]]s
* managing [[terminology database]]s
* creating new terms, as required.

==Types of terminology==
A distinction is made between two types of terminology work:
* '''Ad hoc work on terminology''', which deals with a single term or a limited number of terms
* '''Systematic collection of terminology''', which deals with all the terms in a specific subject field or domain of activity, often by creating a structured [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] of the terms within that domain and their interrelationships.

Ad hoc terminology is prevalent in the [[translation]] profession, where a translation for a specific term (or group of terms) is required quickly to solve a particular translation problem.

==Terminology as a discipline==
A ''terminologist'' intends to hone categorical organization by improving the accuracy and content of its terminology. Technical industries and [[standardization]] institutes compile their own glossaries.  This provides the consistency needed in the various areas&amp;mdash;fields and branches, movements and specialties&amp;mdash;to work with core terminology to then offer material for the discipline's traditional and doctrinal literature.

Terminology is also then key in boundary-crossing problems, such as in language translation and [[social epistemology]].
Terminology helps to build bridges and to extend one area into another. [[Translator]]s research the terminology of the languages they translate. Terminology is taught alongside translation in universities and translation schools. Large translation departments and translation bureaus have a ''Terminology'' section.

The '''Vega Science Trust''' was a [[not-for-profit]] organisation which provided a platform from which [[scientists]] can communicate directly with the public on [[science]] by using [[moving image]], sound and other related means. The Trust closed in 2012 but the website and streaming video remains active (based at Sheffield University).

== History ==
Founded in 1995 by [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Sir Harry Kroto]] and [[BBC]] Education Producer Patrick Reams the Vega Science Trust was awarded a [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science|COPUS]] start-up grant from the [[Royal Society]] in 1995 and then went on in 1999 to be allocated core funding from the [[Office of Science and Technology]] (OST).  Starting with recording science programmes for terrestrial television the Vega Science Trust produced a number of programmes such as recordings of [[Royal Institution]] Discources&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vega.org.uk/video/subseries/12/ Royal Institution Discourse Recordings]&lt;/ref&gt; which were broadcast on [[BBC 2]] and a set of Masterclasses.  In 2001 Harry Kroto was awarded the Royal Society Michael Faraday Prize - the UK's premier award for science communication&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/Michael-Faraday-Prize/ The Royal Society Michael Faraday Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; 'for his dedication to the notion of working scientists being communicators of their work and in particular for his establishment of the Vega Science Trust whose films and related activities reflect the excitement of scientific discovery to the public'.  The Trust went on to co-produce with the BBC [[Open University]] a set of science discussion programmes covering hot topics such as [[Stem Cells]], [[Energy]], [[Mobile Phones]], [[GM Food]], [[Disease]], [[Nanotechnology]] and [[Ageing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vega.org.uk/video/series/2 The Next Big Thing Recordings]&lt;/ref&gt;  With the BBC/Open University the Trust also produced with sponsorship from [[HEFCE]] Widening Participation Team a set of award-winning&lt;ref&gt;[http://bufvc.ac.uk/events/learningonscreen Learning on Screen Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; career programmes featuring young scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vega.org.uk/video/series/10 Snapshots Young Scientist Career Recordings]&lt;/ref&gt;  Both series were broadcast on BBC2.

Very early audio-visual recordings of individual scientists are relatively rare but in the recent past some recordings were  carried out by such organisations as the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/scientists/ BBC Interviews with Scientists 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997 the Vega Science Trust embarked on a plan to record in-depth interviews with scientists such as [[Joseph Rotblat|Rotblat]], [[Frederick Sanger|Sanger]], [[Perutz]], [[Cornforth]], [[Walter Kohn]] and [[Richard R. Ernst|Richard Ernst]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vega.org.uk/video/series/1 Face-to-Face Interviews with Scientists]&lt;/ref&gt; which could be both viewed and preserved as an historical record for the future.  More recently the [[British Library]] embarked on a similar project of recording audio-visual interviews under the National Life Stories project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/nls British Library National Life Stories]&lt;/ref&gt; although at present their archive consists of oral recordings of scientists.  The Vega Science Trust's in-depth interviews with scientists led onto a project recording interviews with Nobel Laureates&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vega.org.uk/video/series/4 Nobel Interviews]&lt;/ref&gt; attending the annual [[Nobel Laureate Meetings at Lindau]] in 2004/5/6.  In 2006 the Vega Science Trust's website received a special mention at The International Association for Media Science&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media-in-science.org/ The International Association for Media Science]&lt;/ref&gt; Awards.

In 2007 the Vega Science Trust started on-going work with [[Jonathan Hare]] BBC [[Rough Science]] on a series of short instructional films&lt;ref&gt;[http://vega.org.uk/video/subseries/27 Instructional Mini Films by Jonathan Hare]&lt;/ref&gt; intended to show how things work.  For instance a number of the films show how we can generate [[electricity]], another shows how we can generate [[wind power]], others the [[molecular]] structure of [[Buckminsterfullerene|C60]], carbon [[Carbon nanotube|nanotube]]s and [[graphene]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanowerk.com/news/newsid=19146.php Article Nanowerk on Graphene modules]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2007-2010 the Trust concentrated on bringing to the public's attention the process of science research.  The Nano2Hybrids&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nano2hybrids.net/ Nano2hybrids website]&lt;/ref&gt; EU [[STReP]] project for instance was an innovative project where research scientists recorded their own progress on a research project to invent a gas sensor made using carbon nanotubes.  In addition recording science in society projects such as Women in Nanotechnology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.womeninnano.de/ Women in Nanotechnology]&lt;/ref&gt; and Diversity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diversity-fp7.eu/ Diversity Project]&lt;/ref&gt; illuminate work&lt;ref&gt;[http://vega.org.uk/video/programme/198 Women in Nanotechnology film]&lt;/ref&gt; towards promoting women scientists into decision making positions in science research environments.

The Vega Science Trust closed in March 2012 after 17 years of operation. However, the website will continue to host the existing film archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vega.org.uk/news/details/8|title = Latest News|date = |accessdate = 17 April 2015|website = The Vega Science Trust|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
The Vega Science Trust was governed by a board of five [[Trustee]]s who are active research scientists, media, copyright, and educational specialists. Trustees step down and/or are re-elected each year.

The Vega Science Trust employed one member of staff (and for a period, a second technical member) and operated in a mixed economy of core grant-in-aid support from [[Florida State University]], and from [[research grant]]s and [[sponsorship]]. It was an independent body with its own self-contained offices, initially in the University of Sussex chemistry department, and later at the Innovation Centre, [[University of Sussex]], [[Brighton]].

== Vision ==

The Vega Science Trust aimed to see science more fully integrated into our everyday culture. Vega's vision has been to do so by providing a platform from which scientists can broadcast science programmes directly to the public.

'''Activities'''

* Recording scientists.
:Covering a wide array of research.
* Making available to the public by streaming from the Vega Science Trust's website.
:Videos stream in different formats.
* Creating an historical archive of some of the world's most eminent scientists.
:Interviewing Nobel Laureates and other eminent scientists.
* Experimenting with new ways of outreaching/engaging with the public via audio-visual means.
:Creating different programme formats.
* Provide on-line science resources for school, university and the public via informal learning.
:Creating informative videos for inparting scientific concepts.

'''Vega Science Trust Collection'''

The collection of recordings also acts as an historical record and archive of world scientists and their research discoveries.  Recorded to broadcast quality they provide a valuable collection, much of which is open to the public via the Vega Science Trust's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vega.org.uk/ Vega Science Trust's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Wickelphone''' is a sequence of three letters or symbols, which occur together in a [[word]].  For example, the word ''strip'' may be decomposed into a set of [[trigram]]s such as ''rip'' and ''str'' &amp;mdash; these are Wickelphones.  The term was devised by [[James McClelland (psychologist)|James McClelland]] and [[David Rumelhart]] in reference to the work of [[Wayne Wickelgren]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=[[Steven Pinker]], A. Prince |title=Connections and symbols |page=89 |chapter=Language and connectionism |publisher=MIT Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-262-66064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rumelhart and McClelland then extended the idea by expressing the triples in [[phonetic]] terms as '''Wickelfeatures'''.  For example, the Wickelphone ''tri'' would correspond to a Wickelfeature of "[[stop consonant|stop]], [[lateral consonant|lateral]], [[vowel]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=98 |title=Social networks and historical sociolinguistics |author=Alexander Bergs |year=2005 |isbn=978-3-11-018310-8 |chapter=Personal pronouns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wireless Andrew is a 2-megabit-per-second wireless local area network connected through access points
to the wired Andrew network, a high-speed Ethernet backbone linking buildings across the Carnegie
Mellon campus.
Wireless Andrew consists of 100 access points covering six buildings on the Carnegie Mellon campus.
The university tested the current setup with over 40 mobile units before allowing general use by
researchers and students in February 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Wireless LAN applications | url=http://www.iet.unipi.it/f.giannetti/documenti/wlan/Data/refer/prosp/application.pdf | accessdate= October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
