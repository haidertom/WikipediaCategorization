      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2875">'''Advancing Secondary Science Education thru Tetrahymena''' ([[Asset (disambiguation)|ASSET]]) is an [[organization]] at [[Cornell University]] that is dedicated to expanding the use of the protist ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' in K-12 classrooms.  They are funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] through the SEPA (Science Education Partnership Award) Program.  Although their name includes the word "secondary," they have worked in recent years to develop materials for students in elementary, middle and high schools.  The group develops modules, which are stand-alone labs or lessons that can be inserted into the curriculum of a class at the discretion of the teacher.

==Modules==

Modules are designed to be stand-alone lessons that fit into and compliment a life [[science]] curriculum.  The ASSET program ships all the equipment that is needed to complete the modules to the [[teacher]] in a reusable plastic container, at ASSET's expense. The teacher who requested the materials can use them for up to two weeks.  At the end of the two weeks, the teacher uses a pre-paid return label to send the materials back in the same container.  Some materials, such as live cells, may be sent separately to provide for a chance for the [[culture]] to be established in the teacher's classroom.

===Science Modules===

ASSET has created fifteen science modules, each of which addresses a particular topic relevant to life science education in [[United States]] school curricula.

====Cannibalism and Interspecefic Predation====

This module utilizes two species of ''[[Tetrahymena]]'':  ''Tetrahymena thermophilia'' and ''Tetrahymena vorax''.   In the lab, an extract, called [[stomatin]], is made from the thermophilia, then placed into the vorax culture.  There, it induces a transformation from the microstome form to the macrostome form in T. vorax.  This transformation is most notable by a marked increase in the size of the cell (doubling or sometimes more), the resorption of the microstomal oral apparatus and the construction of a much larger macrostomal oral apparatus.  This transformation allows the macrostomal T. vorax cells to prey on T. thermophilia, but also to cannibalize the microstomes of their own species.&lt;ref name="vorax paper"&gt;[http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/14/2089.long] In the polymorphic ciliate Tetrahymena vorax, the non-selective phagocytosis seen in microstomes changes to a highly selective process in macrostomes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and Society Modules===

ASSET has also created five science and society modules, which are designed to integrate social studies and science education into one unit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18974">[[File:Visualization of bibliographic coupling.png|thumb|alt=Documents A and B both cite documents C, D and E, hence the documents A and B have a bibliographic coupling strength of three. |Figure visualizing bibliographic coupling between Documents A and B.]]'''Bibliographic coupling''', like [[Co-citation]], is a [[similarity measure]] that uses [[citation analysis]] to establish a similarity relationship between documents. Bibliographic coupling occurs when two works [[citation|reference]] a common third work in their [[Bibliography|bibliographies]]. It is an indication that a probability exists that the two works treat a related subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martyn | first1 = J | year = 1964 | title = Bibliographic coupling | url = | journal = Journal of Documentation | volume = 20 | issue = 4| page = 236 | doi=10.1108/eb026352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two documents are ''bibliographically coupled'' if they both ''cite'' one or more documents in common. The "coupling strength" of two given documents is higher the more citations to other documents they share. The figure to the right illustrates the concept of bibliographic coupling. In the figure, documents A and B both cite documents C, D and E. Thus, documents A and B have a bibliographic coupling strength of 3 - the number of elements in the intersection of their two reference lists.

Similarly, two authors are ''bibliographically coupled'' if the cumulative reference lists of their respective oeuvres each contain a reference to a common document, and their coupling strength also increases with the citations to other documents that their share. If the cumulative reference list of an author's oeuvre is determined as the [[multiset]] union of the documents that the author has co-authored, then the ''author bibliographic coupling strength'' of two authors (or more precisely, of their oeuvres) is defined as the size of the multiset intersection of their cumulative reference lists, however.&lt;ref name="DOI: 10.1002/asi.20910"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhao | first1 = D. | last2 = Strotmann | first2 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Evolution of research activities and intellectual influences in information science 1996–2005: Introducing author bibliographic-coupling analysis | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume = 59 | issue = 13| pages = 2070–2086 | doi = 10.1002/asi.20910 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibliographic coupling can be useful in a wide variety of fields, since it helps researchers find related research done in the past. On the other hand, two documents are '''[[Co-citation|co-cited]]''' if they are both independently ''cited by'' one or more documents.

==History==
The concept of '''bibliographic coupling''' was introduced by M. M. Kessler of [[MIT]] in a paper published in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;"Bibliographic coupling between scientific papers," ''American Documentation'' 24 (1963), pp. 123-131.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been embraced in the work of the information scientist [[Eugene Garfield]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example "Multiple Independent Discovery and Creativity in Science," ''Current Contents'', Nov. 3, 1980, pp. 5-10, reprinted in [http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays.html Essays of an Information Scientist], vol. 4 (1979-80), pp. 660-665.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the earliest citation analysis methods for document similarity computation and some have questioned its usefulness, pointing out that two works may reference completely unrelated subject matter in the third. Furthermore, bibliographic coupling is a retrospective similarity measure,&lt;ref&gt;Garfield Eugene, 2001.[http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/drexelbelvergriffith92001.pdf ''From Bibliographic Coupling to Co-Citation Analysis via Algorithmic Historio-Bibliography''] presented at Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA&lt;/ref&gt; meaning the information used to establish the similarity relationship between documents lies in the past and is static, i.e. bibliographic coupling strength cannot change over time, since outgoing citation counts are fixed.

The [[Co-citation|'''co-citation''' analysis]] approach introduced by Henry Small and published in 1973 addressed this shortcoming of bibliographic coupling by considering a document's incoming citations to assess similarity, a measure that can change over time. Additionally, the co-citation measure reflects the opinion of many authors and thus represents a better indicator of subject similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Small, 1973. [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/gleazer/296_readings/small.pdf "Co-citation in the scientific literature: A new measure of the relationship between two documents"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202085010/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/gleazer/296_readings/small.pdf |date=2012-12-02 }}. ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science'' (JASIS), volume 24(4), pp. 265-269. doi = 10.1002/asi.4630240406&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 Robert Amsler published a paper&lt;ref&gt;Robert Amsler, Dec. 1972 [http://openlibrary.org/works/OL12801639W/Applications_of_citation-based_automatic_classification?v=2 "Applications of citation-based automatic classification"], Linguistics Research Center, University Texas at Austin, Technical Report 72-14.&lt;/ref&gt; describing a measure for determining subject similarity between two documents by fusing bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webla.sourceforge.net/javadocs/pt/tumba/links/Amsler.html Class Amsler] written by Bruno Martins and developed by the XLDB group of the ''Department of Informatics'' of the ''Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon'' in Portugal&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Howard White and Belver Griffith introduced author co-citation analysis (ACA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = Howard D. | last2 = Griffith | first2 = Belver C. | year = 1981 | title = Author Cocitation: A Literature Measure of Intellectual Structure | url = | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 163–171 | doi = 10.1002/asi.4630320302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 2008 did Dangzhi Zhao and Andreas Strotmann combine their work and that of M. M. Kessler to define author bibliographic coupling analysis (ABCA), noting that as long as authors are active this metric is not static and that it is particularly useful when combined with ACA.&lt;ref name="DOI: 10.1002/asi.20910"/&gt;

More recently, in 2009, Gipp and Beel introduced a new approach termed [[Co-citation Proximity Analysis]] (CPA). CPA is based on the concept of co-citation, but represents a refinement to Small's measure in that CPA additionally considers the placement and proximity of citations within a document's full-text. The assumption is that citations in closer proximity are more likely to exhibit a stronger similarity relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Bela Gipp and Joeran Beel, 2009 [http://gipp.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/gipp09a.pdf Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) – ''A new approach for identifying related work based on Co-Citation Analysis''] in Proceedings of the 12th international conference on scientometrics and informetrics (issi’09), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), 2009, pp. 571-575.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, a chronological overview of citation analysis methods includes: 
* Bibliographic coupling (1963) 
* Co-citation analysis (published 1973) 
* Amsler measure (1972)
* Author co-citation analysis (1981)
* Author bibliographic coupling analysis (2008)
* Co-citation proximity analysis (CPA) (2009)

A '''biosand filter''' (BSF) is a point-of-use water treatment system adapted from traditional [[slow sand filter]]s. Biosand filters remove pathogens and suspended solids from water using biological and physical processes that take place in a sand column covered with a [[biofilm]]. BSFs have been shown to remove heavy metals, turbidity, bacteria, viruses and protozoa.&lt;ref name="Elliot"&gt;Elliott, M., Stauber, C., Koksal, F., DiGiano, F., and M. Sobsey (2008). Reduction of E. coli, echovirus type 12 and bacteriophages in an intermittently operated 2 household-scale slow sand filter.Water Research, Volume 42, Issues 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST Biosand Filter Manual 2008|url=http://itacanet.org/eng/water/Section%206%20Water%20treatment/Biosand_filter_CAWST.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; BSFs also reduce discoloration, odor and unpleasant taste. Studies have shown a correlation between use of BSFs and a decrease in the occurrence of [[diarrhea]].&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST Biosand Filter|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/biosand-filter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their effectiveness, ease of use, and lack of recurring costs, biosand filters are often considered [[appropriate technology]] in developing countries. It is estimated that over 200,000 BSFs are in use worldwide.&lt;ref name="Elliot" /&gt;

==History==

The household biosand filter was proposed by Dr. David Manz in the late 1980s at the [[University of Calgary]], Canada.&lt;ref name="CAWSTHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST History|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/about-us/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was developed from the [[slow sand filter]], a technology that has been used for drinking water purification since the 1800s.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt; Initial lab and field tests were conducted in 1991; the system was patented in 1993 &lt;ref name="CAWSTHistory"/&gt; and was implemented in the field in [[Nicaragua]]. The Canadian non-profit company [[Center for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology]] ([[CAWST]]) was co-founded in 2001 by David Manz and [[Camille Dow Baker]] to promote education and training in water purification and sanitation including using this technology, and to continue developing it.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt; A privately owned company, Hydraid Biosand Water Filter  produces and distributes plans for filters.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydraid Biosand Technology|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/biosand-filter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosand filter components==

[[File:Ohorizons Concrete BioSand Filter.png|thumb|Basic Diagram of a Concrete BioSand Filter]]

Biosand filters are typically constructed from concrete or plastic.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"/&gt; At the top of the filter, a tightly fitted lid prevents contamination and unwanted pests from entering the filter. Below this, the diffuser plate prevents disturbance of the [[biofilm]] when water is poured into the filter. Water then travels through the sand column, which removes pathogens and suspended solids. Below the sand column, a layer of gravel prevents sand from entering the drainage layer and clogging the outlet tube. Below the separating layer is the drainage layer consisting of coarser gravel that prevents clogging near the base of the outlet tube.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt;

== Filtration process ==
Pathogens and suspended solids are removed by biological and physical processes that take place in the biolayer and the sand layer. These processes include:
*'''Mechanical trapping:''' Suspended solids and pathogens are trapped in the spaces between the sand grains.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Predation:''' Pathogens are consumed by microorganisms in the biolayer.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Adsorption:''' Pathogens are absorbed into each other and to suspended solids in the water and sand grains.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Natural death:''' Pathogens finish their life cycles or die because there is not enough food or oxygen.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===During the run===
The high water level (hydraulic head) in the inlet reservoir zone pushes the water through the diffuser and filter, then decreases as water flows evenly through the sand. The flow rate slows because there is less pressure to force the water through the filter. The inlet water contains dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and contaminants. It provides the oxygen required by the microorganisms in the biofilm. Large suspended particles and pathogens are trapped in the top of the sand and partially plug the pore spaces between the sand grains. This causes the flow rate to decrease.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===Pause period (idle time)===

Idle time typically comprises greater than 80% of the daily cycle; during this time, microbial attenuation processes are likely to be significant. Most removal occurs where water is in contact with the biofilm. The processes that occur in the biofilm have not been identified.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; When the standing water layer reaches the level of the outlet tube, the flow stops.  Ideally, this should be high enough to keep the biofilm in the sand layer wet and allow oxygen to diffuse through the standing water to the biolayer.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; The pause period allows microorganisms in the biolayer to consume the pathogens and nutrients in the water. The rate of flow through the filter is restored as they are consumed. If the pause period is too long, the biolayer will consume all of the pathogens and nutrients and will die, reducing the efficiency of the filter when it is used again. The pause period should be between 1 and 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Pathogens in the non-biological zone die from a lack of nutrients and oxygen.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

==Maintenance==
Over time, particles accumulate between the filter's sand grains. As more water is poured, a biofilm forms along the top of the diffuser plate. Both of these occurrences cause a decrease in flow rate (clogging and [[bioclogging]]). Although slower flow rates generally improve water filtration due to idle time [APS1], it may become too slow for the users’ convenience. If flow rates fall below 0.1 litres/minute, it is recommended by CAWST to perform maintenance.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; The "swirl and dump", or wet harrowing cleaning technique, is used to restore flow rate. About {{Convert|1|USgal|l}} is poured into the filter before cleaning (assuming the filter is empty). The upper layer of sand is then swirled in a circular motion. Dirty water from the swirling is dumped out and the sand is smoothed out at the top. This process is repeated until flow rate is restored.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; Cleaning the diffuser plate, outlet tube, lid, and outside surfaces of the filters regularly is also recommended.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; Long-term sustainability and efficacy of biosand filters depends on education and support from knowledgeable support personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sisson|first=Andrew J.|author2=Wampler, PJ |author3=Rediske RR |author4= Molla AR |title=An assessment of long-term biosand filter use and sustainability in the Artibonite Valley near Deschapelles, Haiti|journal=Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development|date=January 2013|volume=3|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.2166/washdev.2013.092|url=http://www.iwaponline.com/washdev/003/washdev0030051.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clean Water for Haiti, a non-profit in Haiti implements an education and follow-up program post-installation of the biosand filter. The program includes visits to the beneficiary homes after one, three and twelve months and another at 5 years from installation date. During each visit, beneficiaries receive repeated instruction about safe water practices and how to take care of the filter. Based on data collected since 2010, between 94% and 99% of filters are still being used regularly 12 months after installation. &lt;ref&gt;cleanwaterforhaiti.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Removal of contaminants==

===Turbidity===
Results for turbidity reductions vary depending on the turbidity of the influent water. Turbid water contains sand, silt and clay.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt;  Feed turbidity in one study ranged from 1.86 to 3.9 NTU.  In a study water was obtained from sample taps of water treatment plants from three local reservoirs. It poured through a slow sand filter and results showed that turbidity decreased to a mean of 1.45 NTU.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; In another study using surface water a 93% reduction in turbidity was observed.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"/&gt; As the biofilm above the sand ripens, turbidity removal increases.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Although biosand filters remove much turbidity, slow sand filters, which have a slower filtration rate, remove more.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===Heavy metals===
There is limited research on the removal of heavy metals by biosand filters.  In a study conducted in South Africa, the filter removed about 64% of iron and 5% of magnesium.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"&gt;Mwabi, J.K., F.E. Adeyemo and T.O. Mamba. "Household Water Treatment Systems: A Solution to the Production of Safe Drinking." SAO/NASA ADS: ADS Home Page. Web. 22 Dec. 2011. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PCE....36.1120M&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteria===
In laboratory studies, the biosand filter has been found to remove about 98-99% of bacteria.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"/&gt; In removal of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' it was found that the biosand filter may increase due to biofilm formation over about two months. The removal after this time ranged from 97-99.99% depending on the daily water volume and percent primary effluent added. The addition of primary effluent or waste water facilitates growth of the biofilm which aids bacterial die-off.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Research shows that biosand filters in use in the field remove fewer bacteria than ones in a controlled environment.  In research conducted in 55 households of [[Bonao]], Dominican Republic, the average E. coli reduction was about 93 percent.&lt;ref name="Stauber"/&gt;

===Viruses===
Lab tests have shown that while the filters reduce significant quantities of  E. coli, they remove significantly fewer viruses because viruses are smaller.  In a study using bacteriophages, virus removal ranged between 85% and 95% after 45 days of usage.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; A recent study has suggested that virus removal increases significantly over time, reaching 99.99% after approximately 150 days.&lt;ref name="Virus Removal"&gt;Bradley, I., Straub, A., Maraccini, P., Markazi, Nguyen, T., (2011).  Iron Oxide Amended Biosand Filters for Virus Removal.  Water Research&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protozoa===
In one lab test the biosand filter removed more than 99.9% of [[protozoa]].  In tests for one type of protozoa, ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', the filter removed 100% over 29 days of use. It removed 99.98% of the oocysts of another protozoa, ''Cryptosporidium sp.'', possibly due to their smaller size.  This removal was comparable with that of the slow sand filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-purification/hardware/point-use-water-treatment/bio-sand-filtrat|title=Biosand Filter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health benefits ==

Studies in the Dominican Republic and Cambodia conducted by the [[University of North Carolina]] and the University of Nevada show that BSF use the reduced occurrence of diarrheal diseases by 47% in all age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stauber|first=Christine|author2=Gloria M. Ortiz |author3=Dana P. Loomis |author4=Mark D. Sobsey |title=A Randomized Controlled Trial of the Concrete Biosand Filter and Its Impact on Diarrheal Disease in Bonai, Dominican Republic|journal=The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2009|volume=80|issue=2|pages=286–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by CAWST in Haiti, 95% of 187 households believed their water quality had improved since using biosand filters to clean it. 80% of users stated that their families’ health had improved since implementation. Such health perceptions on the use of biosand filter has shown to be more positive in long-term users.&lt;ref name="Stauber"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sobsey|first=Mark|author2=Christine Stauber |author3=Lisa Casanova |author4=Joseph Brown |author5=Mark Elliott |title=Point of Use Household Drinking Water Filtration: A Practical, Effective Solution for Providing Sustained Access to Safe Drinking Water in the Developing World|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|year=2008|doi=10.1021/es8026133 |volume=43 |pages=970–971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of biosand filters==

===Concrete===

[[Concrete]] filters, of concrete, are the most widespread type of biosand filter.  Concrete is generally preferable to other materials because of the low cost, wide availability and the ability to be constructed on-site. The plans for the concrete filter are distributed openly by CAWST. Several versions have been developed. The CAWST Version 9 biosand filter is constructed with a higher maximum loading rate. Although the filtered water passes EPA water quality standards, it is not optimal.&lt;ref name="CAWSTManual2010"&gt;{{cite journal|title=CAWST Biosand Filter Manual 2010|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/pubs/file/43-pi-for-bsf-manual-complete-english}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research establishes that contact time between the water and the granular material is the leading determinant in purifying water. The CAWST Version 10 biosand filter takes this into account; the volume of the water reservoir is equal to the pore space volume of the sand layer. The maximum loading rate was decreased by 33% to ensure stagnant water is in constant contact with granular material.&lt;ref name="CAWSTManual2010"/&gt;

Concrete BioSand filters are typically manufactured using steel molds. The plans for a steel mold are openly distributed by CAWST.

Clean Water for Haiti, a non-profit organization based in Camp Marie, Haiti manufactures the biosand filters using an adaptation of the steel mold.  &lt;ref&gt;http://cleanwaterforhaiti.org/programs/how-does-the-filter-work/&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-profit organization OHorizons has designed a Wood Mold, based on CAWST’s Version 10 filter, which can function as low-cost alternative. The plans for a Wood Mold are openly available on the OHorizons website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohorizons.org/resources/ OHorizons Wood Mold Construction Manual and Appendix]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plastic===

Plastic filters are constructed from plastic barrels, usually formed offsite. Hydraid biosand filters are constructed from medical grade plastic with [[ultraviolet]] resistance.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"/&gt; TivaWater is the newest version of the plastic biosand filter and has several important improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tivawater.com tivawater.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stainless steel===

A stainless steel biosand filter developed by engineers at [[S M Sehgal Foundation]], an NGO based in Gurugram (formerly Gurgaon), India, has been found to perform better than its concrete counterparts and with a wider opportunity for application and adoption in different geographical conditions. The high cost of plastic prevents its use in rural India. The stainless steel filter, called JalKalp, offers increased filtration rate and better portability (than concrete models) and better production quality control. Concrete filters are prone to breakage and can be difficult to transport due to weight (65&amp;nbsp;kg), make it unsuitable especially in remote rural or hilly locations. Common quality issues are variations in construction material and manufacturing flaws. Further, the efflorescence due to salts in water reduces the life of the concrete filter. The newly developed lightweight (4.5&amp;nbsp;kg) stainless steel biosand filter has an edge over concrete filters, overcoming each of those shortcomings and providing better quality control. Besides improving its appearance, stainless steel adds to the strength, reliability, durability, and portability of the filter. Water quality tests demonstrate JalKalp's effectiveness against E coli, total coliforms, turbidity, and iron contamination. This filter integrates the germicidal properties of copper with the conventional filtration. Introduction of copper foil in the drainage zone of JalKalp filter has increased the removal of total coliform and E coli to 100% from contaminated water. S M Sehgal Foundation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smsfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; promotes the model, which required no electricity, across India through partnerships with like-minded organizations to benefit as many rural families as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Lalit Mohan Sharma and Saurabh Sood, "Reinventing the Biosand Filter: An Easy Solution for Safe Drinking Water," ''IOSR Journals'', International Organization of Scientific Research, Vol 10. Issue 1, pp43-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Reinventing-the-biosand-filter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.indiawaterportal.org/articles/jalkalp-water-sands-impurities /|title=JalKalp: Water sands impurities|last=Bhaduri|first=Amita|publisher= “India Water Portal” 13, November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are challenges to creating biosand water filters in developing countries.  Many lack the professional capability of constructing the metal forms to pour the concrete into. Finding proper mesh sizes to sift the sand layers may also be absent.  In Nicaragua you may find metal workers capable of welding rebar for home construction, however, you will not find sheet metal bending equipment to create the metal molds.  Sand is not sold in hardware stores like in the United States. It is most likely purchased by the pickup load from streambeds or pits and the only mesh available is 1/4 inch which is too large. When traveling to a third world country it might be best to take with you the proper mesh screens.

Another problem facing the use of the filters is adoption. Many projects may provide assistance in building the water filters and some may even distribute them but getting the host country nationals to use the filters requires much more dedication.  People need to be connected to water filter owners to insist they use the devices and get them into the habit of using them.  Otherwise several of the filters are abandoned and left unattended in the roads. Simply handing the filters out is insufficient for adoption.

The '''Celtic cross''' is a form of [[Christian cross]] featuring a [[halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]] or ring that emerged in [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. A type of [[ringed cross]], it became widespread through its use in the stone [[high cross]]es erected across the islands, especially in regions evangelized by [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish missionaries]], from the 9th through the 12th centuries.

A staple of [[Insular art]], the Celtic cross is essentially a [[Latin cross]] with a nimbus surrounding the intersection of the arms and stem. Scholars have debated its exact origins, but it is related to earlier crosses featuring rings. The form gained new popularity during the [[Celtic Revival]] of the 19th century; the name "Celtic cross" is a convention dating from that time. The shape, usually decorated with [[Interlace (art)|interlace]] and other motifs from Insular art, became popular for funerary monuments and other uses, and has remained so, spreading well beyond Ireland.

==Early history==
[[File:Celtic Art in Pagan and Christian Times, p185.png|thumb|Early forms: cross slab, St. Madoes, Perthshire, Scotland]]
[[File:032Galarus Oratory.JPG|thumb|Early forms: pillar stone, [[Gallarus Oratory]], [[County Kerry]], Ireland]]

[[Ringed crosses]] similar to older Continental forms appeared in Ireland and Scotland in incised stone slab artwork and artifacts like the [[Ardagh chalice]]. However, the shape achieved its greatest popularity by its use in the monumental stone [[high cross]]es, a distinctive and widespread form of [[Insular art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Herren |first=Michael W. |last2= Brown|first2= Shirley Ann |year= 2002|title= Christ in Celtic Christianity: Britain and Ireland from the Fifth to the Tenth Century|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFqNUMa8bfYC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Celtic+cross%22+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWh6uw2OrPAhWG4iYKHRZDDrs Q6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Celtic%20cross%22%20origin&amp;f=false |publisher= Boydell Press|pages= 193–195|isbn=0851158897}}&lt;/ref&gt; These monuments, which first appeared in the 9th century, usually (though not always) take the form of a ringed cross on a stepped or pyramidal base.&lt;ref name=Herren1&gt;{{cite book |last= Herren |first=Michael W. |last2= Brown|first2= Shirley Ann |year= 2002|title= Christ in Celtic Christianity: Britain and Ireland from the Fifth to the Tenth Century|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFqNUMa8bfYC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Celtic+cross%22+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWh6uw2OrPAhWG4iYKHRZDDrsQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Celtic%20cross%22%20origin&amp;f=false |publisher= Boydell Press|page= 199|isbn=0851158897}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form has obvious structural advantages, reducing the length of unsupported side arms.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of theories as to its origin in Ireland and Britain. Some scholars consider the ring a holdover from earlier wooden crosses, which may have required struts to support the crossarm. Others have seen it as deriving from indigenous Bronze Age art featuring a wheel or disc around a head, or from early [[Coptic cross]]es based on the [[ankh]]. However, Michael W. Herren, Shirley Ann Brown, and others believe it originates in earlier ringed crosses in [[Christian art]]. Crosses with a ring representing the [[celestial sphere]] developed from the writings of the [[Church Fathers]]. The "cosmological cross" is an important motif in [[Coelius Sedulius]]'s poem ''[[Carmen Paschale]]'', known in Ireland by the 7th century.&lt;ref name=Herren2&gt;{{cite book |last= Herren |first=Michael W. |last2= Brown|first2= Shirley Ann |year= 2002|title= Christ in Celtic Christianity: Britain and Ireland from the Fifth to the Tenth Century|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFqNUMa8bfYC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Celtic+cross%22+origin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWh6uw2OrPAhWG4iYKHRZDDrsQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Celtic%20cross%22%20origin&amp;f=false |publisher= Boydell Press|pages= 199–200|isbn=0851158897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear where the first high crosses originated. The first examples date to about the 9th century and occur in two groups: at [[Ahenny]] in Ireland, and at [[Iona]], an Irish monastery off the Scottish coast. The Ahenny group is generally earlier. However, it is possible that St. Johns Cross at Iona was the first high cross; Iona's influence as a center of pilgrimage may have led this cross to inspire the Ahenny group as well as other ringed crosses in [[Pictish stone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Werner, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of crosses bear inscriptions in [[ogham]]: an early medieval Irish alphabet. Standing crosses in Ireland and areas under Irish influence tend to be shorter and more massive than their Anglo-Saxon equivalents, which have mostly lost their headpieces. Irish examples with a head in cross form include the Cross of [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]], [[Ardboe High Cross]], the crosses at [[Monasterboice]], the Cross of the Scriptures, [[Clonmacnoise]] and those in Scotland at [[Iona]] and the [[Kildalton Cross]], which may be the earliest to survive in good condition. Surviving, free-standing crosses are in [[Cornwall]], including [[St Piran]]'s cross at [[Perranporth]], and [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Langdon, Arthur G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: J. Pollard&lt;/ref&gt; Other stone crosses are found in the former [[Northumbria]] and [[Scotland]], and further south in England, where they merge with the similar Anglo-Saxon cross making tradition, in the [[Ruthwell Cross]] for example. Most examples in Britain were destroyed during the [[Protestant Reformation]]. By about A.D. 1200 the initial wave of cross building came to an end in Ireland.

Popular legend in Ireland says that the Christian cross was introduced by [[Saint Patrick]] or possibly [[Saint Declan]], though there are no examples from this early period. It has often been claimed that Patrick combined the symbol of Christianity with the [[sun cross]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;to give pagan followers an idea of the importance of the cross. By linking it with the idea of the life-giving properties of the sun, these two ideas were linked to appeal to pagans. Other interpretations claim that placing the cross on top of the circle represents Christ's supremacy over the pagan sun.

== Modern times ==

===Celtic Revival===
The [[Celtic Revival]] of the mid-19th century led to an increased use and creation of Celtic crosses in Ireland. In 1853, casts of several historical high crosses were exhibited at the Dublin Industrial Exhibition. In 1857, [[Henry O'Neill (illustrator)|Henry O'Neill]] published ''Illustrations of the Most Interesting of the Sculptured Crosses of Ancient Ireland''. These two events stimulated interest in the Celtic cross as a symbol for a renewed sense of heritage within Ireland.

New versions of the high cross were designed for fashionable cemetery monuments in Victorian Dublin in the 1860s. From Dublin, the revival spread to the rest of the country and beyond. Since the Celtic Revival, the ringed cross became an emblem of Celtic identity, in addition to its more traditional religious symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celtarts.com/revival_crosses.htm Stephen Walker, "Celtic Revival Crosses"], Celtic Arts website, accessed 22 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern interest in the symbol increased because of Alexander and Euphemia Ritchie. The two worked on the Isle of [[Iona]] in Scotland from 1899 to 1940 and popularised use of the Celtic cross in jewelry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexander-ritchie.co.uk/history.htm "A Brief History of the Ritchies"], Alexander Ritchie website, accessed 20 Nov 208&lt;/ref&gt; Using the Celtic cross in fashion is still popular today.

&lt;/Gallery&gt;

Since its revival in the 1850s, the Celtic cross has been used extensively as grave markers. Straying from medieval usage, when the symbol was typically used for a public monument. The Celtic cross now appears in various retail items. Both the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] and the [[Northern Ireland national football team]] have used versions of the Celtic cross in their logos and advertising. The [[Church in Wales]] since 1954 have used a flag with a Celtic cross in the centre.

'''Chorography''' (from [[wikt:χῶρος|χῶρος]] ''khōros'', "place" and [[wikt:γράφω|γράφειν]] ''graphein'', "to write") is the art of describing or mapping a region or district,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chorography|volume=6|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by extension such a description or map.&lt;ref name=Merriam-Webster&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chorography Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; This term derives from the writings of the ancient geographer [[Pomponius Mela]] and  [[Ptolemy]], where it meant the geographical description of regions. However, its resonances of meaning have varied at different times. Richard Helgerson states that "chorography defines itself by opposition to [[chronicle]]. It is the genre devoted to place, and chronicle is the genre devoted to time".&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson 1992, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Darrell Rohl prefers a broad definition of "the representation of space or place".&lt;ref&gt;Rohl 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ptolemy 16century.jpg|thumb|Ptolemy as imagined by a 16th-century artist]]

==Ptolemy's definition==
In his text of the ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' (2nd century CE), Ptolemy defined [[geography]] as the study of the entire world, but chorography as the study of its smaller parts—provinces, regions, cities, or ports. Its goal was "an impression of a part, as when one makes an image of just an ear or an eye"; and it dealt with "the qualities rather than the quantities of the things that it sets down". Ptolemy implied that it was a ''graphic'' technique, comprising the making of views (not simply maps), since he claimed that it required the skills of a draftsman or landscape artist, rather than the more technical skills of recording "proportional placements". Ptolemy's most recent English translators, however, render the term as "regional cartography".&lt;ref&gt;J.L. Berggren and Alexander Jones (eds), ''Ptolemy's Geography'' (Princeton, 2000), pp. 57-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance revival==
Ptolemy's text was rediscovered in the west at the beginning of the fifteenth century, and the term "chorography" was revived by [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Lucia Nuti, 'Mapping Places: Chorography and Vision in the Renaissance', in Denis Cosgrove (ed.), ''Mappings'' (London, 1999), pp. 90-108.&lt;/ref&gt; An early instance is a small-scale map of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in an early fifteenth-century manuscript, which is labelled a ''tabula chorographica''.&lt;ref&gt;British Library Harleian MS 1808, fol. 9v; reproduced in Catherine Delano-Smith and R.J.P Kain, ''English Maps: a History'' (London, 1999), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dee]] in 1570 regarded the practice as "an underling, and a twig of ''Geographie''", by which the "plat" [plan or drawing] of a particular place would be exhibited to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;John Dee, 'Mathematicall Praeface', in Euclid, ''The Elements of Geometrie'', trans. H. Billingsley (London, 1570), sig. A4r.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Camden by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William Camden]]
The term also came to be used, however, for ''written'' descriptions of regions.  These regions were extensively visited by the writer, who then combined local topographical description, summaries of the historical sources, and local knowledge and stories, into a text. The most influential example (at least in Britain) was probably [[William Camden]]'s ''Britannia'' (first edition 1586), which described itself on its title page as a ''Chorographica descriptio''. [[William Harrison (priest)|William Harrison]] in 1587 similarly described his own "Description of Britaine" as an exercise in chorography, distinguishing it from the historical/chronological text of Holinshed's [[Holinshed's Chronicles|''Chronicles'']] (to which the "Description" formed an introductory section).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Harrison |authorlink=William Harrison (priest) |chapter=An Historicall Description of the Iland of Britaine |editor-first=Raphael |editor-last=Holinshed |editor-link=Raphael Holinshed |title=The First and Second Volumes of Chronicles |edition=2nd |place=London |year=1587 |page=sig. [A2]v |url=http://english.nsms.ox.ac.uk/holinshed/texts.php?text1=1587_0002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Heylin]] in 1652 defined chorography as "the exact description of some Kingdom, Countrey, or particular Province of the same", and gave as examples [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]'s ''Description of Greece'' (2nd century AD); Camden's ''Britannia'' (1586); [[Lodovico Guicciardini]]'s ''Descrittione di  tutti i Paesi Bassi'' (1567) (on the [[Low Countries]]); and [[Leandro Alberti]]'s ''Descrizione d'Italia'' (1550).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Heylyn |authorlink=Peter Heylin |title=Cosmographie |location=London |year=1652 |page=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camden's ''Britannia'' was predominantly concerned with the history and antiquities of Britain, and, probably as a result, the term chorography in English came to be particularly associated with [[antiquarian]] texts. [[William Lambarde]], [[John Stow]], [[John Hooker (English constitutionalist)|John Hooker]], [[Michael Drayton]], [[Tristram Risdon]], [[John Aubrey]] and many others used it in this way, arising from a gentlemanly [[topophilia]] and a sense of service to one's county or city, until it was eventually often applied to the genre of [[English county histories|county history]]. A late example was William Grey's ''Chorographia'' (1649), a survey of the antiquities of the city of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. Even before Camden's work appeared, [[Andrew Melville]] in 1574 had referred to chorography and [[chronology]] as the "twa lights" [two lights] of [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=G. R. |editor-last=Kinloch |editor-link=George Ritchie Kinloch |title=The Diary of Mr James Melvill, 1556–1601 |publisher=Bannatyne Club |location=Edinburgh |year=1829 |pages=38–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saxton pamberforest.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Example of [[Christopher Saxton]]'s cartography]]
However, the term also continued to be used for maps and map-making, particularly of sub-national or [[Counties of England|county]] areas. William Camden praised the county mapmakers [[Christopher Saxton]] and [[John Norden]] as "most skilfull Chorographers";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Camden |translator-first=Philemon |translator-last=Holland |translator-link=Philemon Holland |title=Britain, or a Chorographicall Description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Ilands adjoyning, out of the depth of Antiquitie |chapter=The Author to the Reader |place=London |year=1610 |page=sig. [*5]v |url=http://www.philological.bham.ac.uk/cambrit/fronteng.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Plot]] in 1677&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Plot |authorlink=Robert Plot |title=The Natural History of Oxford-shire |location=Oxford |year=1677 |page=299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer)|Christopher Packe]] in 1743&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher |last=Packe |authorlink=Christopher Packe (physician and cartographer) |title=A New Philosophico-Chorographical Chart of East-Kent |location=[Canterbury] |year=1743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both referred to their county maps as chorographies.

By the beginning of the eighteenth century the term had largely fallen out of use in all these contexts, being superseded for most purposes by either "[[topography]]" or "[[cartography]]". [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary]]'' (1755) made a distinction between geography, chorography and topography, arguing that geography dealt with large areas, topography with small areas, but chorography with intermediary areas, being "less in its object than geography, and greater than topography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Samuel |last=Johnson |authorlink=Samuel Johnson |title=A Dictionary of the English Language |location=London |year=1755 |chapter=chorography |page=373 |url=https://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com/page-view/?i=373 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, the term is only rarely found in English by this date.

[[File:Ferdinand von Richthofen.jpg|thumb|upright|Ferdinand von Richthofen]]

==Modern usages==
In more technical geographical literature, the term had been abandoned as city views and [[city map]]s became more and more sophisticated and demanded a set of skills that required not only skilled draftsmanship but also some knowledge of scientific [[surveying]]. However, its use was revived for a second time in the late nineteenth century by the geographer [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]]. He regarded chorography as a specialization within geography, comprising the description through field observation of the particular traits of a given area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html GEO 466/566: The Profession of Geography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211150811/http://www.valpo.edu/geomet/geo/courses/geo466/topics/germany.html |date=2012-02-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also now widely used by historians and literary scholars to refer to the [[Early modern period|early modern]] genre of topographical and antiquarian literature.&lt;ref&gt;Particularly influential in reviving the term has been Helgerson 1992, esp. pp. 105-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19818">'''Coitus reservatus''' (''[[Sexual intercourse|coitus]]'', "sexual intercourse, union" + ''reservatus'', "reserved, saved"),&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's ''Compact Latin Dictionary'', Dell Publishing Co. Inc., 1963&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''sexual continence''', is a form of sexual intercourse in which the penetrative partner does not attempt to [[Ejaculation|ejaculate]] within the receptive partner, but instead attempts to remain at the [[Human sexual response cycle#Plateau phase|plateau phase]] of intercourse for as long as possible avoiding the seminal emission.

[[Alice Stockham]] coined the term ''karezza'', derived from the Italian word "carezza" meaning "caress", to describe coitus reservatus, but the idea was already in practice at the [[Oneida Community]]. [[Alan Watts]] believed, in error, that karezza was a Persian word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Alan W. |title=Nature, Man and Woman |page=172 |year=1970 |publisher=Random House Inc. Vintage Books Edition |lccn=58-8266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of karezza is loosely akin to [[maithuna]] in [[Tantra|Hindu Tantra]] and [[Sahaja]] in Hindu [[Yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coomaraswami |first=Ananda K.|title=The Dance of Shiva |page=124 |publisher=The Noonday Press Inc. |year=1957 |location=New York City |lccn=56-12296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of ejaculation is a key aspect of [[Taoist sexual practices]] (known as "cai Yin pu Yang" and "cai Yang pu Yin").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH23.HTM|title=Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia: T|last=Pauly|first=Ira B.|date=2013-05-23|website=|publisher=Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523194332/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH23.HTM|archive-date=2013-05-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-06-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice of Karezza and Tantric (sexual) continence ==

Stockham writes, "... Karezza signifies 'to express affection in both words and action,' and while it fittingly denotes the union that is the outcome of deepest human affection, love's consummation, it is used technically throughout this work to designate a controlled sexual union." So that in practice, according to Stockham, it is more than just self-control, but mutual control where the penetrative partner helps the receptive partner and vice versa. According to Stockham this is the key to overcoming many difficulties encountered in trying to control sexual expression on an individual basis.{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=22}}
Stockham's contribution was to apply this same philosophy of [[Edging (sexual practice)|orgasm control]] to women as much as to men. A form of [[birth control]], the technique also prolongs sexual pleasure to the point of achieving mystical ecstasy, according to [[John William Lloyd|J. William Lloyd]], a practitioner of Karezza, whose own experience of [[cosmic consciousness]] appears in  ''Cosmic Consciousness'', a book written  by the Canadian psychiatrist [[Richard Maurice Bucke|Richard M. Bucke]], a friend of the American poet [[Walt Whitman]].&lt;ref&gt;Bucke, Richard Maurice, M. D. ''Cosmic Consciousness'', p. 284, Citadel Press, 1961, {{ISBN|0-8065-0211-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this practice,  orgasm is separated from ejaculation, making possible enjoyment of the pleasure of sexual intercourse without experiencing seminal ejaculation, while still experiencing orgasm.

Some would have the principles of karezza applied to masturbation, whereby a person attempts to delay orgasm as long as possible to prolong pleasure in a process known as "orgasmic brinkmanship", "surfing", or "edging" but this is different from the heterosexual practice of "karezza".&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Marie Griffith ''Born Again Bodies'', p. 92, [[University of California Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-520-24240-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin literature, this is known as ''coitus sine ejaculatione seminis''.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, J. William ''The Karezza Method'' Health Research, 1964, Mokelumne Hill, California&lt;/ref&gt;

One purpose of karezza is the maintenance, and indeed, intensification of desire and enjoyment of sexual pleasure within the context of  relationships. According to Stockham, it takes from two weeks to a month for the body to recover from ejaculation ... "Unless procreation is desired, let the final propagative orgasm be entirely avoided".{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=25}} Stockham advocated that the 'honeymoon period' of a relationship could be maintained in perpetuity by limiting the frequency of ejaculations or preferably avoiding them entirely.{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=15}}

Kalman Andras Oszlar writes, "Inasmuch as sexual togetherness is not limited into the physical world and does not mean quick wasting of sexual energies, by this we give free way to higher dimensions in the relationship." Affected by this we may be gotten into the state of flow experience (abbreviated as flow) and in the course of this the couple charges up with energy, while – with focused attention (Dharana) – the couple is submerging in which they are having pleasure. This state of mind is connected with the achieved beneficial effects by tantric restraint and transformation. At first the definition of positive philosophy was defined by [[Mihály Csíkszentmihályi]] and since then it is referred beyond the professional line. According to the professor the flow-experience is an entirely focused and a motivationally intensified experience where in the course of this people can entirely focus and properly command their feelings for the best performance or learning.

===General===
There is a slight difference between karezza and coitus reservatus.  In coitus reservatus, unlike karezza, a woman can enjoy a prolonged orgasm while a man exercises self-control; similarly, in the context of two male sexual partners, the receptive partner can enjoy the stimulation of his prostate for a longer period of time than he would otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Rudolf Von Urban, M. D. ''Sex Perfection and Marital Happiness'', Dial Press, 1949  ISBN B001AA3TWA&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[coitus interruptus]], coitus reservatus is not a reliable form of preventing a [[sexually transmitted disease]], as the penis leaks [[pre-ejaculate]] prior to ejaculation, which may contain all of the same infectious viral particles and bacteria as the actual [[semen]]. Although studies have not found sperm in pre-ejaculate fluid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; the method is also unreliable for [[contraception]] because of the difficulty of controlling ejaculation beyond the point of no return in over-reaching the orgasm. Additionally, if it follows an earlier orgasm, it is possible for pre-ejaculate fluid to pick up sperm from a previous ejaculation, leading to pregnancy even when performed correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Withdrawal Method |work=Planned Parenthood |date=March 2004 | url =http://www.plannedparenthood.com/health-topics/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method-4218.htm |accessdate=2008-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on ''coitus reservatus''===
The [[Oneida Community]], founded in the 19th century by [[John Humphrey Noyes]], experimented with coitus reservatus which was then called '''male continence''' in a religiously [[Christian]] [[communalism|communalist]] environment. The experiment lasted for about a quarter of a century and then Noyes went on to create Oneida silverware and establish the Oneida Silver Co. that grew into [[Oneida Limited]].{{sfn |Ellis |1910 |p=553}}  Noyes identified three functions of the sexual organs: the urinary, the propagative and the amative. Noyes believed in the separation of the amative from the propagative, and he put amative sexual intercourse on the same footing with other ordinary forms of social interchange. Sexual intercourse as Noyes defines it is the insertion of the penis into the vagina; ejaculation is not a requirement for sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Noyes 1872"&gt;{{cite book |title=Male continence |website=Syracuse University Library - Department of Special Collections - Oneida Community Collection |authorlink=John Humphrey Noyes |first=John Humphrey |last=Noyes |archiveurl=https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:2577486$1i |archivedate=2017-11-03 |deadurl=no |year=1877 |orig-year=1872 |location=Oneida, NY |publisher=Office of the American Socialist |oclc=786280936 |url=https://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/m/MaleContinence-51k/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English novelist [[Aldous Huxley]], in his last novel ''Island'' wrote that Maithuna, the Yoga of Love is... "the same as what [[Roman Catholicism]] means by ''coitus reservatus''."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous ''Island, Harper &amp; Row, 1962''&lt;/ref&gt; Getting to the point by discussing ''coitus reservatus'', Alan W. Watts in ''Nature, Man and Woman'' notes: "...I would like to see someone make a case for the idea that the [[Apostles]] really did hand down an inner tradition to the Church, and that through all these centuries the Church has managed to guard it from the public eye. If so, it has remained far more secret and [[esotericism|"esoteric"]] than in any of the other great spiritual traditions of the world, so much so that its existence is highly doubtful..."&lt;ref&gt;"Watts, Alan W. ''Nature, Man and Woman, Ch 7, Pantheon Books Inc. 1958''&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh writer [[Norman Lewis (author)|Norman Lewis]], in his celebrated account of life in [[Naples]] in 1944, claimed that [[Saint Roch|San Rocco]] was the [[patron saint]] of coitus reservatus:  "I recommended him to drink -- as the locals did -- [[Marsala wine|marsala]] with the yolk of eggs stirred into it, and to wear a medal of San Rocco, patron of coitus reservatus, which could be had in any religious-supplies shop".&lt;ref name="Lewis 2005 p. "&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Norman |title=Naples '44 : a World War II diary of occupied Italy |publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf |publication-place=New York |year=2005 |isbn=9781480433250 |oclc=854852494 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/naples-44-a-world-war-ii-diary-of-occupied-italy/oclc/854852494/viewport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coitus reservatus is said by some authors to be a part of the teachings of the Catholic Church regarding sexual intercourse and to be a permitted form of intercourse but was subject to the same arguments as coitus interruptus.&lt;ref name="Bullough 2001 p. "&gt;{{cite book |last=Bullough |first=Vern |title=Encyclopedia of birth control |publisher=ABC-CLIO |publication-place=Santa Barbara, Calif |year=2001 |isbn=9781576075333 |page= |oclc=50174689}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]], the Catholic Church condemned this practice, under the Latin term "amplexus reservatus" (reserved embrace).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Denzinger |first=Heinrich|title=Enchiridion Symbolorum |publisher=Ignatius Press |publication-place=San Francisco, Calif |year=2012 |isbn=9780898707465 |page=810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist [[Havelock Ellis]] writes: "''Coitus Reservatus'', – in which intercourse is maintained even for very long periods, during which a woman may have orgasm several times while the penetrative partner succeeds in holding back orgasm, – so far from being injurious to a woman, is probably the form of coitus which gives her the maximum gratification and relief".{{sfn |Ellis |1910 |p=552}}

== Rosicrucians ==
The [[AMORC]] [[Rosicrucians]] declare openly that they do not engage in sexual practices of an occult nature. This has been so since their First Imperator [[H. Spencer Lewis]], Ph. D. made it public knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, H. Spencer ''Rosicrucian Manual'', p. 5, Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Their rival organization [[Fraternitas Rosae Crucis]] led by Dr. [[R. Swinburne Clymer]] engages in sexual practices for the sake of race regeneration. Dr. Clymer is completely opposed to the practice of Karezza or ''coitus reservatus'' and advocates instead a form of sex intercourse in which the couple experiences the orgasm at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, R. Swinburne MD, ''The Mystery of Sex and Race Regeneration'', p. 223, The Philosophical Publishing Co., 1950&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary of the [[FUDOSI]] instead heartily approves the practice of Karezza to establish harmony in the family as well as in the world by preventing the waste and misuse of sex energy.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Lanval, editor, ''Lumière et Liberté'', Organe Officiel de la Ligue Belge de Propagande Héliophile, Octobre-Novembre 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Arnold Krumm-Heller]] established the [[Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua]] (FRA), a Rosicrucian school in Germany with branches in South America, having the following formula of sexual conduct: "Immissio Membri Virile In Vaginae Sine Ejaculatio Seminis" (Introduce the penis in the vagina without ejaculating the semen). [[Samael Aun Weor]] experimented with that formula and developed the doctrine of ''[[The Perfect Matrimony]]''.

== "Dianism" in Sex Magick == 
{{main|Dianism}}
Inspired by [[Ida Craddock]]'s work Heavenly Bridegrooms, American occultist [[C.F. Russell]] developed his own curriculum of [[sex magick]].&lt;ref name="google.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFs3qoTFVz8C&amp;pg=PA12|title=The Complete Magick Curriculum of the Secret Order G.B.G.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s, disciple Louis T.

== Controversy ==

[[Alice Bunker Stockham|Alice Stockham]] was taken to court and forced to give up teaching the practice of Karezza in the [[United States]]. Like many other sex reformers, Dr. Stockham was arrested by [[Anthony Comstock]].&lt;ref&gt;John P. Deveney ''Paschal B. Randolph'', p. 393, SUNY Press, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3119-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He jailed for long terms a variety of spiritual marriage reformers including [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] who had been a personal friend of [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;Paschal B. Randolph ''Ravalette: The Rosicrucian's Story'', p. 64, Kessinger Publishing, 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-7661-9160-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ida Craddock]] committed [[suicide in the United States|suicide]] after being repeatedly jailed for peddling [[pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;Vern L. Bullough ''Encyclopedia of Birth Control'', pp. 76-9, ABC-CLIO, 2001 {{ISBN|978-1-57607-181-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oneida Community]] was attacked in the press and Noyes was forced to flee to [[Canada]] due to a warrant being issued for his arrest on a [[statutory rape]] charge on June 22, 1879. From there, he advised others to follow [[St. Paul]]'s plan of either [[marriage]] or [[celibacy]], and to obey the [[Ten Commandments|commandments]] against [[adultery]] and [[fornication]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Gutek ''Visiting Utopian Communities'', p. 137, [[University of South Carolina Press]], 1998 {{ISBN|978-1-57003-210-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES)''' is a collaborative research project among national election studies around the world.  Participating countries and polities include a common module of survey questions in their national post-election studies. The resulting data are collated together along with voting, demographic, district and macro variables into one dataset allowing comparative analysis of voting behavior from a multilevel perspective.

The CSES is published as a free, public dataset. The project is administered by the CSES Secretariat, a joint effort between the Institute for Social Research at the [[University of Michigan]] and the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] in Germany.

== Aims and content of the study ==

The CSES project was founded in 1994 with two major aims. The first was to promote international collaboration between national election studies. The second was to allow researchers to study variations in political institutions, especially electoral systems, and their effects on individual attitudes and behaviors, especially turnout and vote choice.

CSES datasets contain variables at three levels.  The first is micro-level variables which are answered by respondents during post-election surveys in each included country.  The second is district-level variables which contain election results from the electoral districts that survey respondents are situated in.  The third is macro-level variables containing information about the country context and electoral system, as well as aggregate data such as economic indicators and democracy indices. This nested data structure, as depicted in Figure 1, allows for multilevel analysis.

[[File:Multi-levelDataStructure.png|thumb|Figure 1: Visualization of CSES multilevel data structure]]

A new thematic module is devised by the CSES Planning Committee every five years. Between the final releases of the complete modules, CSES also disseminates advance releases of datasets periodically, which include partial data for modules that have not been fully released yet.

Survey data collection for '''module 1''' was conducted between 1996 and 2001 and focuses on system performance. The module allows investigation of the impact of electoral institutions on citizens’ political cognition and behavior as well as of the nature of political and social cleavages and alignment. Furthermore, it enables research about citizens’ evaluation of democratic institutions and processes. Module 1 includes 39 election studies conducted in 33 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 2''' was conducted between 2001 and 2006 and focuses on accountability and representation. It addresses the contrast between the view that elections are a mechanism to hold government accountable and the view that they are a means to ensure that citizens’ views and interests are properly represented in the democratic process. Module 2 includes 41 election studies conducted in 38 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 3''' was conducted between 2006 and 2011. The module allows investigating the meaningfulness of electoral choices and, accordingly, focuses on a major aspect of electoral research: the contingency in choice of available options. Module 3 includes 50 election studies conducted in 41 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 4''' was conducted between 2011 and 2016 and focuses on distributional politics and social protection. The main topics investigated are voters’ preferences for public policy and the mediating factors of political institutions and voting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Partial source of text segments about module 1 to module 4: [http://www.gesis.org/en/services/data-analysis/survey-data/rdc-international-survey-programs/cses], accessed June 12, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Module 4 includes 45 election studies conducted in 39 countries.

Survey data collection for '''module 5''' is conducted between 2016 and 2021 and focuses on the electorate's attitudes towards political elites, on the one hand, and towards "out groups", on the other hand. It thus enables research on attitudes and voting behavior in the context of a rise of parties campaigning on anti-establishment messages and in opposition to "out groups".&lt;ref&gt;Partial source of text segment about module 5: [http://www.csesblog.org/2016/09/announcing-cses-module-5/], accessed June 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete table of all variables available across modules can be found on the CSES website.

A frequently updated election study table across all modules can be found on the CSES website.

== Data access ==

CSES data are available publicly and are free of charge. Data releases are non-proprietary – in other words the data are made available to the public without preferential or advance access to anyone. Data is available in multiple formats including for common statistical packages like STATA, SPSS, SAS and R. The data can be downloaded from the CSES website as well as via the GESIS data catalogue. The GESIS online analysis tool ZACAT can furthermore be used to browse and explore the dataset.

==Organizational structure and funding==

===The CSES Secretariat===

In conjunction with national election study collaborators, the CSES Secretariat administers the CSES project. It consists of staff from the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] in Germany and the University of Michigan, Ann-Arbor in the United States. The Secretariat is responsible for compiling the final CSES dataset by harmonizing the single country studies into a cross-national dataset. It is also responsible for collecting the district and macro data, for data documentation, and for ensuring data quality. The Secretariat, furthermore, maintains the CSES website, promotes the project, provides support to the user community, and organizes conferences and project meetings.

===The Planning Committee, collaborators and the CSES Plenary===

The CSES research agenda, study design, and questionnaires are developed by an international committee of leading scholars in political science, sociology, and survey methodology. This committee is known as the CSES Planning Committee. At the beginning of each new module a new Planning Committee is established. Nominations for the Planning Committee come from the user community, with membership of the Committee then being approved by the CSES Plenary Meeting. The Plenary Meeting is made up of national collaborators from each national election study involved in the CSES. Ideas for new modules can be submitted by anyone. More information on the current planning committee, its members, and subcommittee reports, as well as on past Planning Committees can be found on the CSES website. A list of country collaborators which participate in CSES can also be found on the CSES website.

===Funding and support===

The work of the CSES Secretariat is funded by the American [[National Science Foundation]], the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] and the [[University of Michigan]]’s Center for Political Studies along with in-kind support from participating election studies, additional organizations that sponsor planning meetings and conferences, and the many organizations that fund election studies by CSES collaborators.

==Klingemann Prize==

Each year, the CSES awards the GESIS Klingemann Prize for the best CSES scholarship (paper, book, dissertation, or other scholarly work, broadly defined). The award is sponsored by the [[GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]] and is named in honor of Professor Dr. Hans-Dieter Klingemann, co-founder of the CSES, an internationally renowned political scientist who made significant contributions to cross-national electoral research. Nominated works must make extensive use of CSES and have a publication date in the calendar year prior to the award, either in print or online.

Timothy|title=Impact of past crises on current crisis communications: Insights from: Situational crisis communication theory|journal=Journal of Business Communication|year=2004|volume=41|pages=265–289|doi=10.1177/0021943604265607}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 February 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''crisis''' “should be reserved for serious events that require careful attention from management.”{{sfn|Coombs|2012|p=19}}

[[Crisis management]] has been defined as "a set of factors designed to combat crises and to lessen the actual damages inflicted."{{sfn|Coombs|2007|p=5}} Crisis management should not merely be reactionary; it should also consist of preventative measures and preparation in anticipation of potential crises. Effective crisis management has the potential to greatly reduce the amount of damage the organization receives as a result of the crisis, and may even prevent an incident from ever developing into a crisis.{{sfn|Coombs|2012|p=19}}

== Theories in crisis communication research ==
In crisis communication literature, several streams of research exist at the same time. Different theories demonstrate certain ways to look at and explain crisis situations.

=== Image repair theory (IRT) ===
William  established [[Image restoration theory|image repair theory]] (IRT) based on apologia studies. IRT assumes that image is an asset that a person or an organization attempts to protect during a crisis. When the person or the organization is attacked, the accused should draft messages to repair its image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies|last = Benoit|first = William L.|publisher = SUNY Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1438453989|location = Albany:NY|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benoit further introduced 5 general and 14 specific response strategies the accused could harness during a crisis. General categories include deny, evading responsibility, reducing offensiveness, corrective action, and mortification.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Account, Excuses, and Aplogies|last=Benoit|first=William L.|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1438453989|location=Albany:NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) ===
Timothy Coombs started working on [[Situational crisis communication theory|situational crisis communication theory (SCCT)]] in 1995. Originated from [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution theory]], SCCT assumes that crises are negative events that stakeholders attempt to attribute responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Coombs|first = W.Timothy|date = 1995|title = Choosing the right words the development of guidelines for the selection of the "appropriate" crisis-response strategies|url = http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/8/4/447.full.pdf|journal = Management Communication Quarterly|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coombs believes crisis managers can employ different crisis strategies according to different crisis types. Different from IRT, SCCT is an audience-oriented theory which focuses on stakeholders’ perceptions of crisis situations. This idea is in line with Benoit’s argument that crisis concerns more about perception than reality.

=== Social-mediated crisis communication (SMCC) model ===
As social networks and blogs become popular, people spend more time online during crises. Social-mediated crisis communication (SMCC) model is introduced to investigate crisis management in online context. The model first explains how the source and form of information affect response selections and then proposes crisis response strategies. The model argues that five factors influence an organizations’ communication during a crisis: crisis origin, crisis type, infrastructure, message strategy, and message form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Liu|first = Brooke Fisher|date = 2011|title = How publics respond to crisis communication strategies: The interplay of information form and source|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0363811111000956|journal = Public Relations Review|doi =10.1016/j.pubrev.2011.08.004|pmid =|access-date =|volume=37|pages=345–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Integrated crisis mapping (ICM) model ===
Another line of crisis communication research focuses on stakeholders’ emotional changes in times of crises. Jin, Pang, and Cameron introduces integrated crisis mapping (ICM) model to understand stakeholders’ varied emotion during a crisis. ICM assumes that people keep interpreting their emotions during a crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Jin|first = Yan|last2 = Pang|first2 = Augustine|last3 = Cameron|first3 = Glen T.|date = 2012|title = The role of emotions in crisis responses: Inaugural test of the integrated crisis mapping (ICM) model|url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Glen_Cameron/publication/235252414_The_role_of_emotions_in_crisis_responses_Inaugural_test_of_the_integrated_crisis_mapping_(ICM)_model/links/00b49529cdb385a510000000.pdf|journal = Journal of Public Relations Research|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Covariation-based approach to crisis communication ===
As an extension of SCCT, Andreas Schwarz suggested to apply Kelley's covariation principle (attribution theory) more consistently in crisis communication to better explain the emergence and perception of causal attributions in crisis situations and deduce certain information strategies from this model and/or according findings. In this approach the three informational dimensions of consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency are conceptualized for situations of organizational crises (or other types of crisis) to predict the likelihood of stakeholders to make organizational attributions, entity attributions, or circumstance attributions and subsequently influence responsibility perceptions and evaluations of organizational reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwarz|first=Andreas|date=2012|title=Stakeholder attributions in crises: the effects of covariation information and attributional inferences on organizational reputation|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1553118X.2011.596869|journal=International Journal of Strategic Communication|volume=6|issue=2|doi=10.1080/1553118X.2011.596869|pmid=|access-date=1 September 2016|via=|pages=174–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discourse of renewal ===
The [[discourse of renewal]] theory examines the components an organization can employ when navigating a crisis in order to mitigate significant issues within the organization when entering the post-crisis stage. It is a theory assessed by Gregory Ulmer, Timothy Sellnow, and Matthew Seeger as a framework that "emphasizes learning from the crisis, ethical communication, communication that is prospective in nature, and effective organizational rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/855491795|title=Effective crisis communication : moving from crisis to opportunity|last=1969-|first=Ulmer, Robert R.,|others=Sellnow, Timothy L. (Timothy Lester), 1960-, Seeger, Matthew W. (Matthew Wayne), 1957-|isbn=9781452257518|edition=Third|location=Thousand Oaks, California|oclc=855491795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories of crisis management==

Coombs identifies three phases of [[crisis management]].{{sfn|Coombs|2007}}

#''Pre-crisis'': preparing ahead of time for crisis management in an effort to prevent a future crisis from occurring.{{sfn|Coombs|2007}} This category is also sometimes called the ''prodromal'' crisis stage.{{sfn|Finks|1986|p=21}}
#''Crisis'': the response to an actual crisis event.{{sfn|Coombs|2007}}
#''Post-crisis'': occurs after the crisis has been resolved; the efforts by the crisis management team to understand why the crisis occurred and to learn from the event.{{sfn|Coombs|2007}}

Inside the management step, Bodeau-Ostermann identifies 6 successive phases:
- reaction, where the group behaves on first sight,
- extension, because the crisis dilutes itself and touches neighbours,
- means (material and human), which constitutes an overview of success/failures of emergency reaction,
- focus, stands as a concrete action or event on which the team leaders concentrate to fight crisis,
- retraction, is the moment where the group diminishes means involved, in accordance with its aims,
- rehabilitation, where, as a last step, result is, for the group, emergence of new values, stronger than the older.

== Crisis response strategy ==
Both situational crisis communication theory and image repair theory assume organizations should protect their reputation and image through appropriate responses to the crisis. Therefore, how to draft effective message to defend the crisis becomes the focal point of crisis communication research. Image repair theory provides series of options that organizations usually adopt including denial, evade responsibility, reduce offensiveness, corrective action, and mortification. Specifically, denial strategy contains two sub-strategies, simple denial and shift blame. Evade responsibility strategy includes provocation, defeasibility, accident, good intention. Reduce offensiveness strategy garners bolstering, minimization, differentiation, transcendence, attack accuser, and compensation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

SCCT also offers a handful of strategies: denial, scapegoat, attack the accuser, excuse, justification, ingratiation, concern, compassion, regret, apology. Coombs argues different strategy should be adopted according different situations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Crisis communication tactics==

=== Pre-crisis ===

* Researching and collecting information about crisis risks specific to the organization.
* Creating a crisis management plan that includes making decisions ahead of time about who will handle specific aspects of a crisis if and when it occurs. 
* Conducting exercises to test the plan at least annually.&lt;ref name="Coombs"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.instituteforpr.org/crisis-management-communications/|title = Crisis Management and Communications|last = Coombs|first = W. Timothy|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Preparing [[press release]] templates for the organization’s [[public relations]] team in the event of a crisis.
* The chain of command that all employees will follow in the dissemination of information to all [[publics]] during a crisis situation.{{sfn|Coombs|2012|p=20}} 
A rapid response crisis communications team should be organized during the pre-crisis stage &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alfonso|first=González-Herrero|author2=Smith, Suzanne|title=Crisis Communications Management on the Web: How Internet-Based Technologies are Changing the Way Public Relations Professionals Handle Business Crises|journal=Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management|date=2008|volume=16|issue=3|pages=143–153|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-5973.2008.00543.x/abstract|accessdate=28 February 2014|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5973.2008.00543.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all individuals who will help with the actual crisis communication response should be trained.{{sfn|Coombs|2012|pp=20-21}} At this stage the communication professional focuses on detecting and identifying possible risks that could result in a crisis.

=== In-crisis ===

Crisis communication tactics during the crisis stage may include the following: the identification of the incident as a crisis by the organization’s crisis management team; the collection and processing of pertinent information to the crisis management team for decision making; and also the dissemination of crisis messages to both internal and external publics of the organization.{{sfn|Coombs|2012|pp=20-21}}

=== Post-crisis ===

* Reviewing and dissecting the successes and failures of the crisis management team in order to make any necessary changes to the organization, its employees, practices, or procedures.
* Providing follow-up crisis messages as necessary.{{sfn|Coombs|2012|pp=20-21}}
Timothy Coombs proposes that post-crisis communication should include the following five steps:
* Deliver all information promised to stakeholders as soon as that information is known.
* Keep stakeholders updated on the progression of recovery efforts including any corrective measures being taken and the progress of investigations.
* Analyze the crisis management effort for lessons and integrate those lessons in to the organization’s crisis management system.
* Scan the Internet channels for online memorials.
* Consult with victims and their families to determine the organization’s role in any anniversary events or memorials.&lt;ref name="Coombs"/&gt;
In general, Timothy Coombs raises some practices regarding to crisis response strategy based on SCCT that crisis managers should consider carefully.
* All victims or potential victims should receive instructing information, including recall information. This is one-half of the base response to a crisis.
* All victims should be provided an expression of sympathy, any information about corrective actions and trauma counseling when needed. This can be called the “care response.” This is the second-half of the base response to a crisis.
* For crises with minimal attributions of crisis responsibility and no intensifying factors, instructing information and care response is sufficient.
* For crises with minimal attributions of crisis responsibility and an intensifying factor, add excuse and/or justification strategies to the instructing information and care response.
* For crises with low attributions of crisis responsibility and no intensifying factors, add excuse and/or justification strategies to the instructing information and care response.
* For crises with low attributions of crisis responsibility and an intensifying factor, add compensation and/or apology strategies to the instructing information and care response.
* For crises with strong attributions of crisis responsibility, add compensation and/or apology strategies to the instructing information and care response.
* The compensation strategy is used anytime victims suffer serious harm.
* The reminder and ingratiation strategies can be used to supplement any response.
* Denial and attack the accuser strategies are best used only for rumor and challenge crises.

== Benoit's 5 Major Strategies ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}

=== Denial ===
There are two forms of denial: Simple denial which involves denying the involvement or the act, and shifting the blame, which is also known as [[Scapegoating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://emiltowner.com/2007/05/31/benoits-five-major-strategies-2/|title=Benoit’s Five Major Strategies|date=2007-05-31|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2018}}

=== Evasion of Responsibility ===
Evading responsibility involves the following 4 steps. 
# Provocation, suggesting that the accused only responded after being provoked. 
# Defeasibility, suggesting that lack of control or information is to blame. 
# Accidents, suggesting that it was an accident
# Good intentions, suggest that it was done with good intentions in mind, despite the negative outcome. 

=== Reducing ===
The apologists will attempt to reduce the offensiveness of the acts by: 
* Bolstering by describing positive attributes
* Minimizing to decrease the negative view of the situation
* Differentiation by comparing the act to other similar acts that ended in worse terms 
* Transcending by discussion in terms of abstract values and group loyalty.  
* Attacking the accuser in an attempt to eliminate credibility 
* Offering compensation to victims 

=== Corrective Action ===
The apologist will express corrective action when they attempt to correct the situation and prevent it from ever happening again. 

=== Mortification ===
When the apologist admits wrongful behavior and asks for forgiveness while apologizing. 

== Crisis communication dilemma ==
An increasing number of studies are investigating "[[stealing thunder]]". The concept originates from law, which indicates that lawyers report flaws in their own cases instead of giving the opponent opportunities to find the flaw. Journal articles frequently demonstrates the advantage of adopting "stealing thunder" strategy in minimizing reputational loss during crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claeys|first=An-sofie|last2=Cauberghe|first2=Verolien|date=2012|title=Crisis response and crisis timing strategies, two sides of the same coin|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0363811111001317|journal=Public Relations Review|doi=10.1016/j.pubrev.2011.09.001|pmid=|access-date=|volume=38|pages=83–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue organizations should report the problems first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spence|first1=P. R.|author2=Lachlan, K. A.|author3=Omilion-Hodges|first3=L.||author4=Goddard|first4=A.K.|title=Being First Means Being Credible? Examining the Impact of Message Source on Organizational Reputation|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08824096.2013.846259|journal=Communication Research Reports|date=2014|pages=124–130|doi=10.1080/08824096.2013.846259}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the strategy itself is fundamentally counterintuitive.

{{canon Law}}
In the [[jurisprudence of canon law|jurisprudence]] of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]], a '''dispensation''' is the exemption from the immediate obligation of law in certain cases.&lt;ref name=law284&gt;The Law of Christ Vol. I, pg. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Its object is to modify the hardship often arising from the rigorous application of general laws to particular cases, and its essence is to preserve the law by suspending its operation in such cases.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Dispensation |volume=8 |pages=313-315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Since [[law]]s aimed at the good of the entire community may not be suitable for certain cases or persons, the [[legislator]] has the right (sometimes even the duty) to dispense from{{refn|Unlike the English idiom "dispense with", the canonical idiom is "dispense from"|group=note}} the [[law]].&lt;ref name=law284/&gt;

Dispensation is not a permanent power or a special right as in [[privilege (canon law)|privilege]].&lt;ref name=law284/&gt; If the reason for the dispensation ceases entirely, then the dispensation also ceases entirely.&lt;ref name=law285&gt;The Law of Christ Vol. I, pg. 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P9.HTM Canon 93], 1983 Code of Canon Law, accessed June-5-2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NewAdvent.org [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05041a.htm "Dispensation"], accessed June-5-2013&lt;/ref&gt; If the immediate basis for the right is withdrawn, then the right ceases.&lt;ref name=law285/&gt;

===Validity, legality, "just and reasonable cause"===
There must be a "just and reasonable cause"&lt;ref name=can90&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P9.HTM Canon 90 §1], 1983 Code of Canon Law; accessed June-5-2013&lt;/ref&gt; for granting a dispensation. The judgement regarding what is "just and reasonable" is made based upon the particular situation and the importance of the law to be dispensed from.&lt;ref name=can90/&gt; If the cause is not "just and reasonable" then the dispensation is illegal and, if issued by someone other than the lawgiver of the law in question or his superior, it is also invalid.&lt;ref name=can90/&gt; If it is uncertain as to whether a sufficiently "just and reasonable cause" exists, the dispensation is both legal and valid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P9.HTM Canon 90 §2], 1983 Code of Canon Law; accessed June-5-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical legal theory]], the dispensing power is the corollary of the legislative. The dispensing power, like the legislative, was formerly invested in [[Ecumenical council|general councils]] and even in provincial [[synods]]. But in the west, with the gradual centralisation of authority in the [[Roman curia]], it became ultimately vested in the [[pope]] as the supreme lawgiver of the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Despite frequent crises in the diplomatic relations between the [[Holy See]] and temporal governments in the later [[Middle Ages]], the authority of the papacy as the dispenser of [[Actual grace|grace]] and spiritual licences remained largely unchallenged. In the early thirteenth century, [[Pope Innocent III]] (1198–1216) fostered the extension of papal political power. He emphasised, "as had no pope before him, the pope's ''plenitudo potestatis'' ("fullness of power") within the Church." Since the Church comprised the whole of mankind, medieval jurists were accustomed to what we might call shared sovereignty, and freely accepted that the pope had a concurrent jurisdiction with temporal sovereigns.  The temporal princes could administer their own laws, but the princes of the Church, and especially the pope, administered the canon law (so far as it was subject to merely human control).

In the [[decretal]] ''Proposuit'', Innocent III proclaimed that the pope could, if circumstances demanded, dispense from canon law, ''de jure'', with his plenitude of power.  He based his view on ''princeps legibus solutus est'' ("the prince is not bound by the laws").  Because the pope was above the law, time or precedent did not limit his power, and he could dispense with any law.

Such a dispensation was not, strictly speaking, legislative, but rather a judicial, quasi-judicial, or executive act. It was also, of course, subject to the proviso that his jurisdiction to dispense with laws was limited to those laws which were within his jurisdiction or competence.  "[T]his principle would have been a commonplace to anyone who had studied in Bologna."

By this power of dispensation, the pope could release clergy and laity from the obligations of the canon law in all cases that were not contrary to ''[[Divine law|ius divinum]]'' and even in a few cases that were.  This power was most frequently invoked to enable laity to marry notwithstanding impediments of [[Affinity (law)|affinity]] or kinship, and to enable persons labouring under an irregularity (such as of [[bastardy]], servitude, or lack of age) to take orders or become regulars.

Dispensations awarded was classified into three categories:
*The first two categories, rules concerning the procedure of taking [[Holy Orders]], and dispensations concerning tenure of [[benefice]]s, applied only to clergy, and of release from [[religious vows]] for members of [[Catholic religious order]]s.
*The third category, matrimonial dispensations, i.e. regarding marriage, concerned only the laity since [[clerical celibacy|the clergy is celibate]].
*Beside the three main classes of dispensation, the [[Roman Curia]] was ready to grant miscellaneous positive concessions to applicants, from individuals to larger organisations, although the former is rare. This host of dispensations, [[faculty (instrument)|faculties]], and [[indult]]s included permission to eat flesh during [[Lent]], the celebration of offices in [[Chapel of ease|chapels of ease]] and private [[Oratory (worship)|oratories]], and the granting of academic degrees.  Those dispensations relating to academic degrees were mostly issued under the sanction of the canon law, as stated in the constitution of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] beginning ''Cum ex eo''.

==Contemporary use==
As of the early part of the twentieth century, the actual practice of the Roman Catholic Church is based upon the decisions of the [[Council of Trent]], which left the medieval theory intact while endeavouring to guard against its abuses. The proposal put forward by the Gallican and Spanish bishops to subordinate the papal power of dispensation to the consent of the Church in general council was rejected, and even the canons of the council of Trent itself, in so far as they affected reformation of morals or ecclesiastical discipline, were decreed “saving the authority of the Holy See” (Sess. xxv. cap. 21, de ref.). At the same time it was laid down in respect of all dispensations, whether papal or other, that they were to be granted only for just and urgent causes, or in view of some decided benefit to the Church (urgens justaque causa et major quandoque utilitas), and in all cases gratis. The payment of money for a dispensation was ipso facto to make the dispensation void (Sess. xxv. cap. 18, de ref.).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

There are several levels of authority in the Church that are competent to dispense the various demands of Canon Law.  Local [[ordinary (officer)|ordinaries]], for example, are competent to dispense the various [[canonical impediment]]s to the sacrament of marriage.  Some dispensations are reserved to the [[Holy See]], for example, from the impediment to ordination of [[apostasy]].

The power of dispensing lies with the original lawgiver, with his successors or with his superiors, and with those persons to whom they have delegated this right. Since there is no superior above the pope, he can therefore dispense from all [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canonical laws]]: universal laws introduced by himself, his predecessors or general councils, and particular laws enacted by plenary and provincial councils, bishops and similar prelates. As a general rule the [[pope]] delegates his powers to the various [[congregation (Roman Curia)|congregations]] of the [[Roman Curia]] which are charged with granting dispensations in matters within the sphere of their competence.&lt;ref name=whatis47&gt;"What is Canon Law?" pg. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Papal dispensation===
Papal dispensation is a reserved right of the [[pope]] that allows for individuals to be exempted from a specific [[Canon Law]]. Dispensations are divided into two categories: general, and matrimonial. Matrimonial dispensations can be either to allow a marriage in the first place, or to dissolve one.  The authority for the pope to exempt an individual or situation from a law stems from his position as the Vicar of Christ, which implies divine authority and knowledge as well as jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05041a.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Dispensation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first marriage of [[Henry VIII of England]] to [[Catherine of Aragon]] required a papal dispensation as it breached canon law on [[Affinity (canon law)|Affinity]] because she was the widow of Henry's elder brother [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]].  This was obtained successfully, but when he later wished to divorce her, he was famously unable to get another one, causing his [[English Reformation|break with Rome]]. &lt;!-- cn --&gt;Their daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]], a fervent Catholic, would later apply for a secret dispensation absolving her of submitting to the basic rules of Protestant religion when pressured under the threat of death by her father.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;!--cn end--&gt;

In the earlier Middle Ages, especially the 11th to 12th centuries, the church had developed canon law on affinity and [[consanguinity]] (the first denoting a connection by marriage only, the second a genetic one) to cover very remote relationships, so that a very high proportion of marriages between the small and inter-related European elites needed expensive dispensations from either the Pope or a bishop.  This was recognised as an abuse, and later the relationships covered were reduced.  In 1059, the eleventh canon of the [[Council of Rome]] recognized the impediment of affinity as well as of consanguinity to extend to the seventh degree, the high point of the restrictions.  [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] in the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) limited both affinity and consanguinity needing dispensation to the fourth degree, and the [[Council of Trent]] (Sess. XXIV, c. iv, De Ref.) in the 16th century limited the juridical effect of extra-matrimonial intercourse to the second degree of affinity.

==Matrimonial dispensation==
A matrimonial dispensation is the relaxation in a particular case of an impediment prohibiting or annulling a marriage. It may be granted: (a) in favour of a contemplated marriage or to legitimize one already contracted; (b) in secret cases, or in public cases, or in both; (c) in foro interno only, or in foro externo (the latter includes also the former). Power of dispensing in foro interno is not always restricted to secret cases (casus occulti).
These expressions are by no means identical.

''The information in this section concerns [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] in the early 20th century. The canon law in question was considerably changed by the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)#Codification|1917 Code of Canon Law]] and the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] and should not be considered to reflect the present situation.''

=== General powers of dispensation ===
==== The Pope and his Curia ====
The Pope cannot dispense from impediments founded on [[Divine law]] — except, as above described, in the case of [[vows]], espousals and non-consummated marriages, or valid and consummated marriage of [[wikt:neophyte|neophyte]]s before [[baptism]]. In doubtful cases, however, he may decide authoritatively as to the objective value of the doubt. In respect of impediments arising from ecclesiastical law the pope has full dispensing power. Every such dispensation granted by him is valid, and when he acts from a sufficient motive it is also licit.

He is not, however, out of consideration for the public welfare, to exercise this power personally, unless in very exceptional cases, where certain specific impediments are in question. Such cases are error, violence, Holy orders, disparity of worship, public [[conjugicide]], [[consanguinity]] in the direct line or in the first degree (equal) of the collateral Line and the first degree of affinity (from lawful intercourse) in the direct line. As a rule the pope exercises his power of dispensation through the Roman Congregations and Tribunals.

Until around the 1900s, the [[Dataria]] was the most important channel for matrimonial dispensations when the impediment was public or about to become public within a short time. The [[Holy Office]], however, had exclusive control ''in foro externo'' over all impediments connected with or juridically bearing on matters of faith, e. g. disparity of worship, ''mixta religio'', Holy orders, etc. The dispensing power ''in foro interno'' lay with the [[Penitentiaria]], and in the case of pauperes or quasi-pauperes this same Congregation had dispensing power over public impediments in foro externo. The Penitentiaria held as pauperes for all countries outside of Italy those whose united capital, productive of a fixed revenue, did not exceed 5370 lire (about 1050 dollars); and as quasi-pauperes, those whose capital did not exceed 9396 lire (about 1850 dollars). It likewise had the power of promulgating general indults affecting public impediments, as for instance the indult of 15 November 1907. [[Propaganda Fide]] was charged with all dispensations, both in foro inferno and in foro externo, for countries under its jurisdiction, as was the Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs for all countries depending on it, e. g. Russia, Latin America and certain [[apostolic vicariate]]s and [[prefectures Apostolic]].

On 3 November 1908, the duties of these various Congregations received important modifications in consequence of the [[Apostolic Constitution]] "Sapienti", in which [[Pope Pius X]] reorganized the Roman Curia. Dispensing power from public impediments in the case of pauperes or quasi-pauperes was transferred from the Dataria and the Penitentiaria to a newly established [[Roman Congregation]] known as the [[Congregatio de Disciplinâ Sacramentorum]], the Penitentiaria retaining dispensing power over occult impediments in foro interno only. The Holy Office retained its faculties, but restricted expressly under three heads: (1) disparity of worship; (2) mixta religio; (3) the [[Pauline privilege]].

''[[Congregatio de Propaganda Fide]]'' remained the channel for securing dispensations for all countries under its jurisdiction, but being required for the sake of executive unity, to defer, in all matters concerning matrimony, to the various Congregations competent to act thereon, its function became that of intermediary. In America, the United States, Canada and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], and in Europe, the British Isles were withdrawn from Propaganda, and placed under the common law of countries with a hierarchy. The Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs lost all its powers; consequently the countries hitherto subject to it must address themselves either to the Holy Office or to the Congregatio de Disciplinâ Sacramentorum according to the nature of the impediment.

The powers of any Congregation are suspended during the vacancy of the [[Holy See]], except those of the [[Apostolic Penitentiary]] in the [[internal forum]] (''in foro interno''), which, during that time, are even increased. Though suspended, the powers of a Congregation may be used in cases of urgent necessity.

==== The diocesan bishops ====
We shall treat first of their fixed perpetual faculties, whether ordinary or delegated, afterwards of their habitual and temporary faculties. By virtue of their ordinary power (Jurisdiction) [[bishop]]s can dispense from those prohibent impediments of ecclesiastical law which are not reserved to the pope. The reserved impediments of this kind are espousals, the vow of perpetual [[chastity]], and vows taken in diocesan [[religious institute]]s, mixta religio, public display and solemn blessing at marriages within forbidden times, the [[vetitum]], or [[interdict]] laid on a marriage by the pope, or by the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] in a case of appeal. The bishop may also dispense from diriment impediments after the following manner: —

# By tacit consent of the Holy See he can dispense in foro interno from secret impediments from which the pope is wont to exercise his power of dispensing, in three cases: (a) in marriages already contracted and consummated, when urgent necessity arises (i. e. when the interested parties cannot be separated without scandal or endangering their souls, and there is no time to have recourse to the Holy See or to its delegate) — it is, however, necessary that such marriage shall have taken place in lawful form before the Church, and that one of the contracting parties at least shall have been ignorant of the impediment; (b) in marriages about to be contracted and which are called embarrassing (perplexi) cases, i. e. where everything being ready a delay would be defamatory or would cause scandal; (c) when there is a serious doubt of fact as to the existence of an impediment; in this case the dispensation seems to hold good, even though in course of time the impediment becomes certain, and even public. In cases where the law is doubtful no dispensation is necessary; but the bishop may, if he thinks proper, declare authentically the existence and sufficiency of such doubt.
# By virtue of a decree of the Congregation of the Inquisition or Holy Office (20 February 1888) diocesan bishops and other ordinaries (especially a [[Vicar Apostolic]], [[administrator Apostolic]] and [[Prefect Apostolic]], having jurisdiction over an allocated territory, also [[vicar-general]] ''in spiritualibus'' and a [[vicar capitular]]) may dispense in very urgent (''gravissimum'') danger of death from all diriment impediments (secret or public) of ecclesiastical law, except priesthood and affinity (from lawful intercourse) in the direct line. However, they can use this privilege only in favour of persons actually living in real concubinage or united by a merely civil marriage, and only when there is no time for recourse to the Holy See. They may also legitimize the children of such unions, except those born of adultery or sacrilege. In the decree of 1888 is also included the impediment of clandestinity. This decree permits therefore (at least until the Holy See shall have issued other instructions) to dispense, in the case of concubinage or civil marriage, with the presence of the priest and of the two witnesses required by the Decree "Ne temere" in urgent cases of marriage in extremis. Canonists do not agree as to whether bishops hold these faculties by virtue of their ordinary power or by general delegation of the law. It seems to us more probable that those just described under #1 belong to them as ordinaries, while those under #2 are delegated. They are, therefore, empowered to delegate the former; in order to subdelegate the latter they must be guided by the limits fixed by the decree of 1888 and its interpretation dated 9 June 1889. That is, if it is a question of habitual delegation parish priests only should receive it, and only for cases where there is no time for recourse to the bishop.

Besides the fixed perpetual faculties, bishops also receive from the Holy See habitual temporary indults for a certain period of time or for a limited number of cases. These faculties are granted by fixed "formulæ", in which the Holy See from time to time, or as occasion requires it, makes some slight modifications. These faculties call for a broad interpretation. Nevertheless, it is well to bear in mind, when interpreting them, the actual legislation of the Congregation whence they issue, so as not to extend their use beyond the places, persons, number of cases and impediments laid down in a given indult. Faculties thus delegated to a bishop do not in any way restrict his ordinary faculties; nor (in se) do the faculties issued by one Congregation affect those granted by another. When several specifically different impediments occur in the same case, and one of them exceeds the bishop's powers, he may not dispense from any of them.

Even when the bishop has faculties for each impediment taken separately he cannot (unless he possesses the faculty known as ''de cumulo'') use his various faculties simultaneously in a case where, all the impediments being public, one of them exceeds his ordinary faculties, it is not necessary for a bishop to delegate his faculties to his vicars-general; since 1897 they were always granted to the bishop as ordinary, therefore to the vicar-general also. With regard to other priests a decree of the holy Office (14 December 1898) declared that for the future temporary faculties may be always subdelegated unless the indult expressly states the contrary. These faculties are valid from the date when they were granted in the Roman Curia. In actual practice they do not expire, as a rule, at the death of the pope nor of the bishop to whom they were given, but pass on to those who take his place (the ''vicar capitular'', the administrator or succeeding bishop). Faculties granted for a fixed period of time, or a limited number of cases, cease when the period or number has been reached; but while awaiting their renewal the bishop, unless culpably negligent, may continue to use them provisionally. A bishop can use his habitual faculties only in favour of his own subjects. The matrimonial discipline of the Decree ''[[Ne temere]]'' (2 August 1907) contemplates as such all persons having a true canonical domicile, or continuously resident for one month within his territory, also vagi, or persons who have no domicile anywhere and can claim no continuous stay of one month. When a matrimonial impediment is common to both parties the bishop, in dispensing his own subject, dispenses also the other.

====Vicars capitular and vicars-general ====
A vicar capitular, or in his place a lawful administrator, enjoys all the dispensing powers possessed by the bishop in virtue of his ordinary jurisdiction or of delegation of the law; according to the actual discipline he enjoys even the habitual powers which had been granted the deceased bishop for a fixed period of time or for a limited number of cases, even if the indult should have been made out in the name of the Bishop of N. Considering the actual praxis of the Holy See, the same is true of particular indults (see below). The vicar-general has by virtue of his appointment all the ordinary powers of the bishop over prohibent impediments, but requires a special mandate to give him common-law faculties for diriment impediments. As for habitual temporary faculties, since they are now addressed to the ordinary, they belong also ipso facto to the vicar-general while he holds that office. He can also use particular indults when they are addressed to the ordinary, and when they are not so addressed the bishop can always subdelegate him, unless the contrary be expressly stated in the indult.

==== Parish priests and other ecclesiastics ====
A parish priest by common law can dispense only from an interdict laid on a marriage by him or by his predecessor. Some canonists of note accord him authority to dispense from secret impediments in what are called embarrassing (''perplexi'') cases, i. e. when there is no time for recourse to the bishop, but with the obligation of subsequent recourse ad cautelam, i. e. for greater security; a similar authority is attributed by them to confessors. This opinion seems yet gravely probable, though the Penitentiaria continues to grant among its habitual faculties a special authority for such cases and restricts somewhat its use.

===Particular indults of dispensation ===
When there is occasion to procure a dispensation that exceeds the powers of the ordinary, or when there are special reasons for direct recourse to the Holy See, procedure is by way of ''supplica'' (petition) and private [[rescript]]. The supplica need not necessarily be drawn up by the petitioner, nor even at his instance; it does not, however, become valid until he accepts it. Although, since the Constitution "Sapienti", all the faithful may have direct recourse to the Roman Congregations, the supplica is usually forwarded through the ordinary (of the person's birthplace or domicile, or since the Decree "Ne temere" the residence of one of the petitioners), who transmits it to the proper Congregation either by letter or through his accredited agent; but if there is question of sacramental secrecy, it is sent directly to the Penitentiaria, or handed to the bishop's agent under a sealed cover for transmission to the Penitentiaria. The supplica ought to give the names (family and Christian) of the petitioners (except in secret cases forwarded to the Penitentiaria), the name of the Ordinary forwarding it, or the name of the priest to whom, in secret cases, the rescript must be sent; the age of the parties, especially in dispensations affecting consanguinity and affinity; their religion, at 1east when one of them is not a Catholic; the nature, degree and number of all impediments (if recourse is had to the Congregatio de Disciplinâ Sacramentorum or to the Holy Office in a public impediment, and to the Penitentiaria at the same time in a secret one, it is necessary that the latter should know of the public impediment and that recourse has been had to the competent Congregation). The supplica must also contain the causes set forth for granting the dispensation and other circumstances specified in the Propaganda Fide Instruction of 9 May 1877 (it is no longer necessary, either for the validity or liceity of the dispensation, to observe the paragraph relating to incestuous intercourse, even when probably this very thing had been alleged as the only reason for granting the dispensation). When there is question of consanguinity in the second degree bordering on the first, the supplica ought to be written by the bishop's own hand. He ought also to sign the declaration of poverty made by the petitioners when the dispensation is sought from the Penitentiaria ''in formâ pauperum''; when he is in any way hindered from so doing he is bound to commission a priest to sign it in his name. A false declaration of poverty henceforth does not invalidate a dispensation in any case; but the authors of the false statement are bound in conscience to reimburse any amount unduly withheld (regulation for the Roman Curia of 12 June 1908). For further information on the many points already briefly described see the special canonical works, wherein are found all necessary directions as to what must be expressed so as to avoid nullity. When a supplica is affected (in a material point) by [[obreption]] or [[subreption]] it becomes necessary to ask for a so-called "reformatory decree" in case the favour asked has not yet been granted by the Curia, or for the letters known as "Perinde ac valere" if the favour has already been granted. If after all this a further material error is discovered, letters known as "Perinde ac valere super perinde ac valere" must be applied for.&lt;ref&gt;See Gasparri, "Tractatus de matrimonio" (2nd ed., Rome, 1892), I, no. 362.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispensation rescripts are generally drawn up ''in formâ commissâ mixtâ'', i. e. they are entrusted to an executor who is thereby obliged to proceed to their execution, if he finds that the reasons are as alleged (''si vera sint exposita''). Canonists are divided as to whether rescripts in formâ commissâ mixtâ contain a favour granted from the moment of their being sent off, or to be granted when the execution actually takes place. Gasparri holds it as received practice that it suffices if the reasons alleged be actually true at the moment when the petition is presented. It is certain, however, that the executor required by Penitentiaria rescripts may safely fulfil his mission even if the pope should die before he had begun to execute it. The executor named for public impediments is usually the ordinary who forwards the supplica and for secret impediments an approved confessor chosen by the petitioner. Except when specially authorized, the person delegated cannot validly execute a dispensation before he has seen the original of the rescript. Therein it is usually prescribed that the reasons given by the petitioners must be verified. This verification, usually no longer a condition for valid execution, can be made, in the case of public impediments, extrajudicially or by subdelegation. In foro interno it can be made by the confessor in the very act of hearing the confessions of the parties. Should the inquiry disclose no substantial error, the executor proclaims the dispensation, i. e. he makes known, usually in writing, especially if he acts in foro externo, the decree which dispenses the petitioners; if the rescript authorizes him, he also legitimizes the children. Although the executor may subdelegate the preparatory acts, he may not, unless the rescript expressly says so, subdelegate the actual execution of the decree, unless he subdelegates to another ordinary. When the impediment is common to, and known to, both parties, execution ought to be made for both; wherefore, in a case in foro interno, the confessor of one of the parties hands over the rescript, after he has executed it, to the confessor of the other. The executor ought to observe with care the clauses enumerated in the decree, as some of them constitute conditions sine quâ non for the validity of the dispensation. As a rule, these clauses affecting validity may be recognized by the conditional conjunction or adverb of exclusion with which they begin (e. g. dummodo, "provided that"; et non aliter, "not otherwise"), or by an ablative absolute. When, however, a clause only prescribes a thing already of obligation by law it has merely the force of a reminder. In this matter also it is well to pay attention to the stylus curiœ, i. e. the legal diction of the Roman Congregations and Tribunals, and to consult authors of repute.

=== Causes for granting dispensations ===
Following the principles laid down for dispensations in general, a matrimonial dispensation granted without sufficient cause, even by the pope himself, would be illicit; the more difficult and numerous the impediments the more serious must be the motives for removing them. An unjustified dispensation, even if granted by the pope, is null and void, in a case affecting the Divine law; and if granted by other bishops or superiors in cases affecting ordinary ecclesiastical law. Moreover, as it is not supposable that the pope wishes to act illicitly, it follows that if he has been moved by false allegations to grant a dispensation, even in a matter of ordinary ecclesiastical law, such dispensation is invalid. Hence the necessity of distinguishing in dispensations between motive or determining causes (''causœ motivœ'') and impulsive or merely influencing causes (''causœ impulsivœ''). Except when the information given is false, still more when he acts spontaneously (''motu proprio'') and "with certain knowledge", the presumption always is that a superior is acting from just motives. It may be remarked that if the pope refuses to grant a dispensation on a certain ground, an inferior prelate, properly authorized to dispense, may grant the dispensation in the same case on other grounds which in his judgment are sufficient. Canonists do not agree as to whether he can grant it on the identical ground by reason of his divergent appreciation of the latter's force.

Among the sufficient causes for matrimonial dispensations we may distinguish canonical causes, i. e. classified and held as sufficient by the common law and canonical jurisprudence, and reasonable causes, i. e. not provided for nominally in the law, but deserving of equitable consideration in view of circumstances or particular cases. An Instruction issued by Propaganda Fide (9 May 1877) enumerated sixteen canonical causes. The "Formulary of the Dataria" (Rome, 1901) gave twenty-eight, which suffice, either alone or concurrently with others, and act as a norm for all sufficient causes; they are: smallness of place or places; smallness of place coupled with the fact that outside it a sufficient dowry cannot be had; lack of [[dowry]]; insufficiency of dowry for the bride; a larger dowry; an increase of dowry by one-third; cessation of [[family feud]]s; preservation of [[peace]]; conclusion of peace between princes or states; avoidance of lawsuits over an inheritance, a dowry or some important business transaction; the fact that a fiancée is an orphan or has the care of a family; the age of the fiancée over twenty-four; the difficulty of finding another partner, owing to the fewness of male acquaintance, or the difficulty the latter experience in coming to her home; the hope of safeguarding the faith of a Catholic relation; the danger of a denominationally mixed marriage; the hope of converting a non-Catholic party; the keeping of property in a family; the preservation of an illustrious or honourable family; the excellence and merits of the parties; defamation to be avoided, or scandal prevented; [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] already having taken place between the petitioners, or [[rape]]; the danger of a civil marriage; of marriage before a Protestant minister revalidation of a marriage that was null and void; finally, all reasonable causes judged such in the opinion of the pope (e. g. the public good), or special reasonable causes actuating the petitioners and made known to the pope, i. e. motives which, owing to the social status of the petitioners, it is opportune should remain unexplained out of respect for their reputation. These various causes have been stated in their briefest terms. To reach their exact force, some acquaintance is necessary with the ''stylus curiœ'' and the pertinent works of reputable authors, always avoiding exaggerated formalism. This list of causes is by no means exhaustive; the Holy See, in granting a dispensation, will consider any weighty circumstances that render the dispensation really justifiable.

===Costs of dispensations ===
The [[Council of Trent]] (Sess. XXIV, cap. v, De ref. matrim.) decreed that dispensations should be free of all charges. Diocesan chanceries are bound to conform to this law (many pontifical documents, and at times clauses in indults, remind them of it) and neither to exact nor accept anything but the modest contribution to the chancery expenses sanctioned by an Instruction approved by [[Innocent XI]] on 8 October 1678, and known as the Innocentian Tax (''[[Taxa Innocentiana]]''). Rosset holds that it is also lawful, when the diocese is poor, to demand payment of the expenses it incurs for dispensations. Sometimes the Holy See grants ampler freedom in this matter, but nearly always with the monition that all revenues from this source shall be employed for some good work, and not go to the diocesan curia as such. Henceforth every rescript requiring execution will state the sum which the diocesan curia is authorized to collect for its execution.

In the Roman Curia the expenses incurred by petitioners fall under four heads:
# expenses (''expensœ'') of carriage (postage, etc.), also a fee to the accredited agent, when one has been employed. This fee is fixed by the Congregation in question;
# a tax (''taxa'') to be used in defraying the expenses incurred by the Holy See in the organized administration of dispensations;
# the ''componendum'', or [[Charity (practice)|eleemosynary]] (alms) fine to be paid to the Congregation and applied by it to pious uses;
# an alms imposed on the petitioners and to be distributed by themselves in good works.

The moneys paid under the first two heads do not affect, strictly speaking, the gratuity of the dispensation. They constitute a just compensation for the expenses the petitioners occasion the Curia. As for the alms and the componendum, besides the fact that they do not profit the pope nor the members of the Curia personally, but are employed in pious uses, they are justifiable, either as a fine for the faults which, as a rule, give occasion for the dispensation, or as a check to restrain a too great frequency of petitions often based on frivolous grounds. And if the Tridentine prohibition be still urged, it may be truly said that the pope has the right to abrogate the decrees of councils, and is the best judge of the reasons that legitimize such abrogation. The custom of tax and componendum is neither uniform nor universal in the Roman Curia.

==Secular law equivalent==
Dispensation is the canonical equivalent of ''license''&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Edition; pg. 423&lt;/ref&gt; which, according to [[Black's Law Dictionary]], is the authorisation to do something which would normally be illegal if the competent authority had not granted permission.&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Edition; pg. 829&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doxa''' ([[ancient Greek]] δόξα; from verb δοκεῖν ''dokein'', "to appear", "to seem", "to think" and "to accept"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddoke%2Fw δοκέω] in Liddell and Scott&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning common [[belief]] or popular [[opinion]]. Used by the Greek [[rhetorics|rhetoricians]] as a tool for the formation of argument by using common opinions, the ''doxa'' was often manipulated by [[sophist]]s to [[persuasion|persuade]] the [[people]], leading to [[Plato]]'s condemnation of [[Athenian democracy]].

The word ''doxa'' picked up a new meaning between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC when the [[Septuagint]] translated the Hebrew word for "glory" (כבוד, ''kavod'') as ''doxa''. This translation of the Hebrew Scriptures was used by the [[early church]] and is quoted frequently by the New Testament authors. The effects of this new meaning of ''doxa'' as "glory" is made evident by the [[ubiquitous]] use of the word throughout the New Testament and in the worship services of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], where the glorification of God in true worship is also seen as true belief. In that context, doxa reflects behavior or practice in worship, and the belief of the whole church rather than personal opinion. It is the unification of these multiple meanings of doxa that is reflected in the modern terms of [[orthodoxy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=orthodox |title="Orthodox" Etymology |accessdate=2008-07-01 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |work= |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[heterodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heterodox |title="Heterodox" Etymology |accessdate=2008-07-01 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |work= |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ware |first1=Bishop Kallistos (Timothy) |authorlink1=Kallistos Ware |title=The Orthodox Church |edition=new |pages=8,266 |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Penguin Books |date=29 Apr 1993 |isbn=978-0-14-014656-1 |ref=none }}&lt;/ref&gt; This semantic merging in the word ''doxa'' is also seen in Russian word слава (''slava''), which means ''glory'', but is used with the meaning of ''belief'', ''opinion'' in words like православие (''pravoslavie'', meaning ''orthodoxy'', or, literally, ''true belief'').

==Doxa, a philosopheme==
In Plato's [[Gorgias (dialogue)]], Plato presents the Sophists, rhetors who taught people how to speak for the promise of commercial success, as wordsmiths that ensnare and use the malleable doxa of the "multitude" to their advantage without shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/gorgias.html |title='Gorgias |last=Plato |date= 380 B.C.E.  |trans-title=Benjamin Jowett |publisher=[[Internet Classics Archive]] |accessdate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this and other writings, Plato relegated doxa as being a belief, unrelated to reason, that resided in the unreasoning, lower-parts of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sorabji |first1=Richard|editor-last=Nussbaum |editor-first=Martha C.|date= March 26, 1992 |title= Essays on Aristotle's De Anima |publisher= Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint extended into the concept of doxasta in Plato's [[Theory of Forms]], which states that physical objects are manifestations of doxa and are thus not in their true form.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last= Szaif |first= Jan |date= 2007 |title= Doxa and Episteme as Modes of Acquaintance in Republic V |url= http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/people/jmszaif/jan-szaifs-home-page/talks-and-final-drafts/doxa-and-episteme-as-modes-of-acquaintance-in-republic-v/view |journal= Les Etudes Platoniciennes |publisher= Les Belles Lettres |volume= IV |pages= 253–272 |accessdate= 2 March 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140306030717/http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/people/jmszaif/jan-szaifs-home-page/talks-and-final-drafts/doxa-and-episteme-as-modes-of-acquaintance-in-republic-v/view |archivedate= 6 March 2014 |df=  }} &lt;/ref&gt; Plato's framing of ''doxa'' as the opponent of [[knowledge]] led to the classical opposition of [[error]] to [[truth]], which has since become a major concern in [[Western philosophy]]. (However, in the ''Theaetetus'' and in the ''Meno'', Plato has [[Socrates]] suggest that knowledge is ''orthos doxa'' for which one can provide a ''logos'', thus initiating the traditional definition of knowledge as "[[justified true belief]]".) Thus, error is considered in [[Western world|Occident]] as pure negativity, which can take various forms, among them the form of [[illusion]]. As such, ''doxa'' may ironically be defined as the "philosopher's sin" {{citation needed|reason=interesting idea, but needs evidence|date=January 2016}}. In classical rhetoric, it is contrasted with ''[[episteme]]''.

Plato's student [[Aristotle]] objected to Plato's theory of doxa. Aristotle perceived that doxa's value was in practicality and common usage, in contrast with Plato's philosophical purity relegating doxa to deception. Further, Aristotle held doxa as the first step in finding knowledge, as doxa had found applications in the physical world and those who held it had a great number of tests done to prove it and thus reason to believe it.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url= http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/sageukcst/doxa/0 |title= Doxa |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2005  |website= Credo Reference |publisher= Sage UK |accessdate=March 2, 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle clarifies this by categorizing the accepted truths of the physical world that are passed down from generation to generation as ''endoxa''.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last=Eggs |first= Ekkehard |last2= McElholm |first2= Dermot |date= 2002 |title= Doxa in Poetry: A Study of Aristotle's Poetics |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/poetics_today/v023/23.3eggs.pdf |journal= Poetics Today  |publisher= Duke University Press |volume= 23 |pages= 395-426 |accessdate= March 1, 2014 |doi=10.1215/03335372-23-3-395}} &lt;/ref&gt; Endoxa is a more stable belief than ''doxa'', because it has been "tested" in argumentative struggles in the ''[[Polis]]'' by prior interlocutors. The use of ''endoxa'' in the Stagirite's ''[[Organon]]'' can be found in Aristotle's ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'' and ''[[Rhetoric]]''.

==Use in sociology and anthropology&lt;!--linked from 'Pierre Bourdieu'--&gt;==

[[Pierre Bourdieu]], in his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'',&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1977 [1972]. Outline of a Theory of Practice. R. Nice, transl. Volume 16. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; used the term ''doxa'' to denote what is taken for granted in any particular society. The ''doxa'', in his view, is the experience by which "the natural and social world appears as self-evident".&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu (1972); p.164&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses what falls within the limits of the thinkable and the sayable ("the universe of possible discourse"), that which "goes without saying because it comes without saying".&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu (1972); pp. 167, 169&lt;/ref&gt; The humanist instances of Bourdieu's application of notion of ''doxa'' are to be traced in ''Distinction'' where ''doxa'' sets limits on social mobility within the social space through limits imposed on the characteristic consumption of each social individual: certain cultural artifacts are recognized by ''doxa'' as being inappropriate to actual social position, hence ''doxa'' helps to petrify social limits, the "sense of one's place", and one's sense of belonging, which is closely connected with the idea that "this is not for us" (''ce n'est pas pour nous''). Thus individuals become voluntary subjects of those incorporated mental structures that deprive them of more deliberate consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1979. La Distinction. Critique Sociale du Jugement. Paris: Les éditions de minuit. Page 549&lt;/ref&gt;

Doxa and opinion denote, respectively, a society's taken-for-granted, unquestioned truths, and the sphere of that which may be openly contested and discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/pers/bourdieu_pierre.htm Pierre Bourdieu - AnthroBase - Dictionary of Anthropology: A searchable database of anthropological texts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourdieu explains the term "doxa" in his interview with theorist [[Terry Eagleton]]. To explain the term, he uses an example about the common beliefs in school. He asked students what qualifies as achievement in school. In response, the students on the lower end of the academic spectrum viewed themselves as being inferior or not as smart as the students who excelled. The responses are where doxa comes into play, because that was the common belief and attitude that the students had based on what society pushed them to believe. Bourdieu believes that doxa derived from socialization, because socialization also deals with beliefs deriving from society, and as we grow up in the environment, we tend to believe what society tells us is correct.

It is a socially accepted misconception, that if you do not score as high as someone else then you are obviously not as smart as they are. Scores do not prove that one is smarter, because there are many different factors that play into what you score on a test. People may excel within a certain topic and fail at another. However, even though it is a misconception, people tend to partake in common practices to make themselves feel better. For example, the students who feel inferior due to popular belief that they are not as smart as the students who score higher than them, may experiment with drugs to ease the insecurities they face. Bourdieu believes that doxa is more than common belief. He believes that it also has the potential to give rise to common action.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. and Eagleton, T. "Doxa and common life". New Left Review, 1992, p. 199, 111-121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vernon, Phillip E. "Intelligence and Cultural Environment". London: Methuen, 1969, p 215. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in democracy==

While doxa is used as a tool for the formation of [[argument]], it should be noted that it is also formed by argument. The former can be understood as told by [[James A. Herrick]] in ''The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction'': "The Sophists in Gorgias hold that rhetoric creates truth that is useful for the moment out of doxa, or the opinions of the people, through the process of argument and counterargument. Socrates will have no part of this sort of 'truth' which, nevertheless, is essential to a democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herrick|first=James, A.|title=The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction, 3rd ed.|year=2005|publisher=Allyn and Bacon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly noted, democracy, which by definition is the manifestation of public opinion, is dependent upon, and therefore also constrained by, the same limits imposed upon the individuals responsible for its establishment. Due to compromised opinions within a society, as well as opinions not counted for due to inaccessibility and apathy, doxa is not [[homogeneous]], nor is it created agreeably. Rather, it is pliable and imperfect—the outcome of an ongoing power struggle between clashing "truths".
 
To expand upon the quote from his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'' in the above section, "Use in sociology and anthropology", Bourdieu writes, "When there is a quasi-perfect correspondence between the objective order and the subjective principles of organization (as in ancient societies) the natural and social world appears as self-evident. This experience we shall call doxa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=Outline of a Theory of Practice|year=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Smith of the [[University of Chicago]] observes in his article "The limitations of doxa: agency and subjectivity from an archaeological point of view": "Bourdieu consigns the practices of the denizens of ancient societies to the realm of doxa, their lives cast as routines predicated upon the mis-recognition of social orders as natural ways of life, rather than political products."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Adam T.|title=The Limitations of Doxa: Agency and subjectivity from an archaeological point of view|journal=Journal of Social Archaeology|year=2001|volume=1|issue=2|page=156|doi=10.1177/146960530100100201}}&lt;/ref&gt; This calls to attention that the notion of social order as naturally occurring is misperceived, disregarding its creation by political argumentation.
 
Doxa, then, can be understood as created by argument as well as used in the formation of argument, essential for the establishment of democratic policies.

An '''eco-municipality''' or '''eco-town''' is a [[local government]] area that has adopted [[ecological]] and [[social justice]] values in its [[charter]]. The development of eco-municipalities stems from changing systems in [[Sweden]], where more than seventy municipal governments have accepted varying principles of [[sustainability]] in their operations as well as community-wide decision making processes.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Spencer (September 22, 2005) [http://sustainablebusiness.com/features/feature_template.cfm?ID=1269 Building Sustainable Cities: Scandinavia's "Eco-Municipalities" Show the Way].sustainablebusiness.com. Retrieved on: November 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these policies is to increase the overall sustainability of the community.

The distinction between an eco-municipality and other [[sustainable development]] projects (such as [[green building]] and [[alternative energy]]) is the focus on community involvement and social transformation in a public agency as well as the use of a [[holistic]] [[systems thinking|systems]] approach. An eco-municipality is one that recognizes that issues of sustainability are key to all decisions made by government. &lt;ref&gt;Torbjorn Lahti and Sarah James (May 17, 2005) [http://www.wisconsinplanners.org/Ecomunicipalities/EcoMunicipalitySynopsis.pdf The Eco-municipality Model for Sustainable Community Change: A systems approach to creating sustainable communities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807163009/http://www.wisconsinplanners.org/Ecomunicipalities/EcoMunicipalitySynopsis.pdf |date=2008-08-07 }}.

==History==
In 1983 the [[Övertorneå]] community of Sweden first adopted an Eco-municipality framework followed by a formal organization in 1995 (SEKOM).

==Framework==
In becoming an eco-municipality, cities or towns typically adopt a resolution, based on the [[Natural Step|Natural Step framework]] (or Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development ([[FSSD]])), which sets the following objectives:
* Reduce dependence upon fossil fuels.
* Reduce dependence upon synthetic chemicals.
* Reduce encroachment upon nature.
* Better meet human needs fairly and efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Alliance for Sustainability [http://www.afs.nonprofitoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B2E02B44E-ED9D-4C45-B7C7-A670267AE29A%7D&amp;DE=%7B037A8207-109E-46C0-B083-E96FD3882316%7D Ashland, WI and Duluth, MN become Sustainable Cities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903103742/http://www.afs.nonprofitoffice.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B2E02B44E-ED9D-4C45-B7C7-A670267AE29A%7D&amp;DE=%7B037A8207-109E-46C0-B083-E96FD3882316%7D |date=2011-09-03 }}.

==Municipalities adopting framework==
Communities in [[North America]], [[Europe]] and Africa ranging in size from villages of 300 to cities of 700,000 have become eco-municipalities. In Sweden, over one hundred municipalities have officially become eco-municipalities. They have formed a [http://www.sekom.se national association of eco-municipalities] to assist one another and work to influence national policy. [[Whistler, BC]], was awarded first place in a [[United Nations]]-endorsed international competition for sustainable communities. Its long-term sustainability plan, Whistler 2020, is based on the Natural Step framework.&lt;ref&gt;Sustain Dane [http://www.sustaindane.org/Pages/ecomunicipality_where.htm Eco-municipalities: Where Are They?]. Retrieved on: February 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Wisconsin]], there is a growing eco-municipality movement which began in the Chequamegon Bay region. As of November 2007, twelve local communities had formally adopted eco-municipality resolutions. The resolutions state the community's intention to become an eco-municipality, endorsing the Natural Step sustainability principles and framework as a guide.&lt;ref&gt;1,000 Friends of Wisconsin.

'''Evocation''' is the act of calling upon or summoning a [[spirit]], [[demon]], [[god]] or other [[supernatural]] agent, in the [[Western mystery tradition]]. Comparable practices exist in many [[religion]]s and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]al traditions and may employ the use of mind-altering substances with and without uttered word formulas.

==In the Western mystery tradition==
[[File:A Magician by Edward Kelly.jpg|thumb|250px|[[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and [[Edward Kelley]] evoking a spirit]]
The [[Latin]] word ''[[evocatio]]'' was the "calling forth" or "summoning away" of a city's [[tutelary deity]]. The ritual was conducted in a military setting either as a threat during a [[siege]] or as a result of surrender, and aimed at diverting the god's favor from the opposing city to the Roman side, customarily with a promise of a better-endowed cult or a more lavish temple.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, ''Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Evocatio'' was thus a kind of ritual dodge to mitigate looting of sacred objects or images from shrines that would otherwise be sacrilegious or impious.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Purcell, "On the Sacking of Corinth and Carthage", in ''Ethics and Rhetoric: Classical Essays for Donald Russell on His Seventy (Oxford University Press, 1995), pp. 140–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The calling forth of spirits was a relatively common practice in [[Neoplatonism]], [[theurgy]] and other esoteric systems of antiquity. In contemporary [[Western mystery tradition|western esotericism]], the magic of the [[grimoire]]s is frequently seen as the classical example of this idea. Manuals such as the ''[[Key of Solomon|Greater Key of Solomon the King]]'', The ''[[Lemegeton|Lesser Key of Solomon]]'' (or ''Lemegeton''), the ''[[The Book of Abramelin|Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage]]'' and many others provided instructions that combined intense devotion to the divine with the summoning of a personal cadre of spiritual advisers and [[Familiar spirit|familiars]].

The grimoires provided a variety of methods of evocation. The spirits are, in many cases, commanded in the [[Names of God|name of God]] - most commonly using cabalistic and Hellenic 'barbarous names' added together to form long [[Litany|litanies]]. The magician used [[wand]]s, staves, [[incense]] and fire, [[Athame|dagger]]s and complex diagrams drawn on parchment or upon the ground. In [[Enochian magic]], spirits are evoked into a [[crystal ball]] or mirror, in which a human volunteer (a 'seer') is expected to be able to see the spirit and hear its voice, passing the words on to the evoker. Sometimes such a seer might be an actual [[Medium (spirituality)|medium]], speaking as the spirit, not just for it. In other cases the spirit might be 'housed' in a symbolic image, or conjured into a diagram from which it cannot escape without the magician's permission.

While many later, corrupt and commercialized grimoires include elements of '[[diabolism]]' and one (''[[The Grand Grimoire]]'') even offers a method for making a pact with the [[devil]], in general the art of evocation of spirits is said to be done entirely under the power of the divine. The magician is thought to gain authority among the spirits only by purity, worship and personal devotion and study.

In more recent usage, ''evocation'' refers to the calling out of lesser spirits (beneath the [[Deity|deific]] or [[archangel]]ic level), sometimes conceived of as arising from the self. This sort of evocation is contrasted with [[invocation]], in which spiritual powers are called into the self from a divine source.

Important contributors to the concept of evocation include [[Henry Cornelius Agrippa]], [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett]], [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Franz Bardon]] and [[Kenneth Grant]]. The work of all of these authors can be seen as attempts to systematize and modernize the grimoiric procedure of evocation. Many modern authors, such as [[Peter J. Carroll|Peter Carroll]] and [[Konstantinos (occultist)|Konstantinos]], have attempted to describe evocation in a way independent enough from the grimoiric tradition to fit similar methods of interaction with alleged supernatural agents in other traditions.

'''Conjuration''' in traditional and most contemporary usage refers to a [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] act of invoking spirits or using incantations or charms to cast magical spells. In the context of [[legerdemain]], it may also refer to the performance of illusion or [[magic (illusion)|magic tricks]] for show. This article discusses mainly the original and primary usage, describing acts of a [[supernatural]] or [[paranormal]] nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conjure |title=Conjure &amp;#124; Define Conjure at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/conjuration |title=Conjuration &amp;#124; Define Conjuration at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word conjuration (from Latin ''conjure'', ''conjurare'', to "swear together") can be interpreted in several different ways: as an [[invocation]] or evocation (the latter in the sense of binding by a vow); as an [[exorcism]]; and as an act of producing effects by [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] means.

The word is often used synonymously with terms such as "invocation" or "evocation" or "summoning", although many authors find it useful to maintain some distinction between these terms. The term "conjuring" is also used as a general term for casting spells in some magical traditions, such as [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]]. In that context, amulets and talismans are often kept in a "conjure bag" and "conjuring oils" may be used to anoint candles and other magical supplies and thus imbue them with specific magical powers.

Alternatively, the term "conjuration" may be used refer to an act of [[magic (illusion)|illusionism]] or legerdemain, as in the performance of magic tricks for entertainment.

One who performs conjurations is called a conjurer or conjuror.
The word (as ''conjuration'' or ''conjurison'') was formerly used in its Latin meaning of "conspiracy".&lt;ref&gt;Ex. gr. Chaucer, Wycliffe, Caxton; see [[OED]] s.v.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts and language==
The text of the charms to be recited to conjure the spirit varies considerably from simple sentences to complex paragraphs with plenty of magic words. The language usually is that of the conjurer's, but since the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Western mystery tradition|Western tradition]], [[Latin]] was the most common (although many texts have been translated into other languages).

==Objectives of conjuration==
The conjuration of the [[ghost]]s or [[soul]]s of the dead for the purpose of [[divination]] is called [[necromancy]].

When it is said that a person is calling upon or conjuring misfortune or disease, it is due to the ancient belief that personified diseases and misfortune as evil [[deity|deities]], spirits or [[demon]]s that could enter a human or bestial body; see [[demon possession]].

==Religious views==
A conjuration is traditionally linked to repelling negative spirits away, and protecting an individual, space or collective. However, it is also believed by some, particularly in [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], that magic and conjuration is an inherently evil practice. Conjurers summon demons or other evil spirits to cause harm to people or things, to obtain favors from them, or simply to enter their servitude. The belief in similarly-minded conjurers also exists in belief systems in which magic is not inherently evil, although in these cultures these "[[black magic]]ians" are not the rule and have opposition among more traditional magicians.

== Conjuration in Mid-West Asia ==
{{unsourced section|date=December 2018}}
Conjuration is a very common [[Mysticism|mystical]] practice in Mid-West Asia, most commonly found in [[Morocco]], [[Oman]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the United Arab Emirates and [[Iraq]]. Many practice it to settle personal grudges or for healing, personal enhancement, or foretelling the future. There are also those who will sell their services as conjurers to others.

[[Islam]] strongly forbids the use of conjuration, because it is seen as an unholy procedure, and therefore to perform it is to give an insult to Allah. It is also considered to, in the end, harm people more than help them: those who regularly contact demons are believed to go mad through overdosing on power, or being possessed (since demons are thought to be short-tempered entities, and given the opportunity might overpower and enslave the one who summoned them).

Within some [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] traditions today, such as [[contemporary witchcraft]], [[hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] and [[Hermeticism]] or [[ceremonial magic]], conjuration may refer specifically to an act of calling or invoking deities and other spirits; or it may refer more generally to the casting of magic spells by a variety of techniques.&lt;ref name="Conjure"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=[[Harry Houdini|Houdini, Harry]]|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Harry-Houdini-on-conjuring-1973131|title=Conjuring |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |edition=13th |year=1926 |accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used in the sense of invoking or evoking deities and other spirits, conjuration can be regarded as one aspect of [[magic and religion|religious magic]].

In the context of [[magic (illusion)|illusionist magic]] practiced today as entertainment only, "conjurer" or "conjuror" is still a common term used by practitioners. In times past, illusionist conjurors were suspected of using magic power to create their entertaining illusions and even suspected of casting spells. They were regarded as "magicians" by the general public, who were often not cognizant of the techniques and tricks used to create their illusions.

==In other beliefs==
Evocation is the [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] art of calling forth [[spirit]]s, [[angel]]s or [[demon]]s to bring spiritual inspiration, do the bidding of the magician or provide information. Methods of this exist in many cultures that feature a belief in spirits, such as the [[shamanism|shamanic traditions]]. [[Daoism]], [[Shintoism]], [[Spiritism]] and the African-American religions ([[Santería]], [[Umbanda]] etc.), have particular systems of evocation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29300">An important part of the heritage of '''family resilience''' is the concept of individual [[psychological resilience]] which originates from work with children focusing on what helped them become resilient in the face of adversity. Individual resilience emerged primarily in the field of [[developmental psychopathology]] as scholars sought to identify the characteristics of children that allowed them to function "OK" after adversity. Individual resilience gradually moved into understanding the processes associated with overcoming adversity, then into prevention and intervention and now focuses on examining how factors at multiple levels of the system (e.g., molecular, individual, family, community) and using interdisciplinary approaches (e.g., medical, social services, education) promote resilience.&lt;ref name="Luthar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masten &amp; Monn" /&gt; Resilience also has origins to the field of [[positive psychology]]. The term resilience gradually changed definitions and meanings, from a personality trait&lt;ref name="Ali" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masten &amp; Obradovic" /&gt; to a dynamic process of families, individuals, and communities.&lt;ref name="Luthar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 2002" /&gt;

Family resilience emerged as scholars incorporated together ideas from general [[systems theory]] perspectives on families, family stress theory, and [[psychological resilience]] perspectives.&lt;ref name="Hawley" /&gt; Two prominent approaches to family resilience are to view families as contexts of individual resilience and families as systems.&lt;ref name="Patterson" /&gt; In the field of [[family therapy]] the families as systems approach to family resilience is often used based on the assumption that significant risk, protective mechanisms, and positive adaptation occur at multiple interrelated system levels (individual, subsystem, system, or ecosystem).&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt; Thus, ''family resilience'' involves the application of concepts such as resilience, [[adaptation]] and [[coping (psychology)|coping]] to a significant stressor or [[adversity]] from a family systems perspective.

==Definition==

One of the common factors associated with successful adaptation and coping is identified as resilience of individual family members. [[Resilience (psychology)|Resilience]] can be generally defined as the ability to "bounce back" to healthy functioning when faced with significant stressors and events.&lt;ref name="Masten &amp; Obradovic" /&gt;  The concept of resilience has been heavily researched in adolescents and now includes specific character traits and behaviors known as protective and recovery factors.&lt;ref name="McCubbin &amp; Patterson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shin" /&gt; Previously, researchers have focused on identifying the characteristics of resilient individuals and started to explore the possibility of family resilience and family coping with stress.&lt;ref name="McCubbin &amp; Patterson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 2003" /&gt; Currently, researchers are focused on specific interventions to increase resilience in the family unit, while considering related [[Genetics|genetic]] and environmental factors.&lt;ref name="Masten &amp; Obradovic" /&gt;

There are diverse definitions of what resilience and/or family resilience is. The National Network for Family Resiliency&lt;ref name="National Network" /&gt; defines resilience as "the family's ability to cultivate strengths to positively meet the challenges of life". Atkinson, Martin, &amp; Rankin&lt;ref name="Atkinson" /&gt; define resilience as "the ability to bounce back and have better physical and mental health outcomes". For family resilience specifically, McCubbin &amp; McCubbin&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1988" /&gt; have posited that "family resilience includes the characteristics, dimensions, and properties of families which help families to be resilient to disruption in the face of change and adaptive in the face of crisis situations".&lt;ref name="Black &amp; Lobo" /&gt;

Using a combination of the above work, family resilience can be generally defined as: a dynamic process of families that have been exposed to a significant stressor or adversity that requires protective and recovery factors, identified by the family, as helpful to promote healthy coping in families and their self-identified family members. In the February 2015 special issue of [[Family Relations (journal)]] on individual and family resilience,&lt;ref name="Criss" /&gt; authors provide a variety of definitions of family resilience. For example, Masten and Monn (p.&amp;nbsp;6) define resilience as "the capacity for adapting successfully in the context of adversity".&lt;ref name="Masten &amp; Monn" /&gt;

==Research==

Resilience and family resilience have been studied in the context of various theoretical underpinnings. These include [[Albert Bandura|Bandura's]] [[Self-efficacy|Self-Efficacy Theory]], [[Richard Lazarus|Lazarus]]' Stress Theory, Froma Walsh's Family Resilience Framework, and McCubbin and Patterson’s Family Stress and Resilience Model.
The family stress theory originates from the family systems model that considers all members of the family as important and as a system where all parts and interactions between and among those parts as important.&lt;ref name="Walsh 2003" /&gt; The Family Stress and Resilience Model by McCubbin &amp; McCubbin&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1993" /&gt; has been adopted by the field of family [[nursing]] because of the use in [[wikt:diverse|diverse]] families and because of the connection to the nursing metaparadigm of person, environment, health, and nursing&lt;ref name="National Network" /&gt; This strong theoretical connection to resilience and nursing supports the interest from nursing, which focuses on caring for diverse families and individuals in a holistic manner.

Henry, Morris, &amp; Harrist&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt; proposed the overarching Family Resilience Model (FRM) as a general model of family resilience within which existing models fit as ways of looking at family resilience. Based on a review of existing individual and family resilience scholarship, these authors developed the FRM to include key ideas from individual resilience, proposing that significant risk suggests increased risk for negative outcomes. This risk can be lowered through protective mechanisms, increasing the potential for positive outcomes, or heightened through vulnerabilities that pile up to increase the potential for negative outcomes.&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt; However, significant risk, protection, vulnerability, and outcomes (or adaptation) occur within the context of family meanings, family adaptive systems (emotional systems, control systems, identity systems, maintenance systems, stress-response systems) in the particular family, and broader ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt;

Resilience as a concept has been heavily studied on the individual level in children who have experienced significant [[Stress (biology)|stress]] or [[Adversity|adversities]]. Family resilience is another level of resilience that is related to complex relationships and environmental factors. Fields that have utilized resilience research include [[psychology]]&lt;ref name="Luthar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Patterson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saltzman" /&gt; [[sociology]],&lt;ref name="Hawley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, K., Bryant, D. D., Collins, D. A., Noe, T. D., Strader, T. N., &amp; Berbaum, M. (1998). Preventing and reducing alcohol and other drug use among high-risk youths by increasing family resilience. Health &amp; Social Work, 43 (4), 297-308.&lt;/ref&gt; [[education]],&lt;ref name="Masten &amp; Obradovic" /&gt; psychiatry&lt;ref name="MacDermid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sapienza" /&gt; and [[nursing]].&lt;ref name="Shin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkinson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Black &amp; Lobo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Earvolino-Ramirez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Benzies" /&gt; The concept of resilience is attractive to many different health related fields because of all that remains unknown about the process, as well as the potential for reducing or preventing adverse outcomes due to significant experiences with adversity. Once thought of as simply a [[personality trait]], resilience has become known as a dynamic process with many related factors that can change throughout an individual’s life. Since resilience is also related to experience to stressors and ultimately results in healthy [[coping (psychology)|coping]], connections can be made with resilience literature, military family literature, and other stress/coping literature&lt;ref name="Ali" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Westphal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCubbin 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mansfield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lester" /&gt;

==Difference with individual resilience==

Family and individual resilience factors are not always the same. Family factors consist of [[stress management]], [[emotion regulation]] skills, [[goal setting|collaborative goal setting]] and [[problem solving]].&lt;ref name="Saltzman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simon" /&gt; In contrast, individual factors that foster resilience include [[Flexibility (personality)|flexibility]], use of [[social support]], rebounding, high expectations, humor, [[self-efficacy]], and [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name="Luthar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Earvolino-Ramirez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedl" /&gt; While few valid and reliable measures exist to measure resilience or family resilience specifically, much recent work has focused on measuring these attributes&lt;ref name="Benzies" /&gt; of resilient families.

Family resilience is a strengths-oriented approach that tends to emphasize positive outcomes at the overall family system level, within family systems, in individual family members, and in the family-ecosystem fit and recognize the subjective meanings families bring to understanding risk, protection, and adaptation.&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt;

==Measuring==

According to Henry et al.&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt; when examining family resilience is critical to be aware of some key issues: (a) '''significant risk''' must be present for resilience to occur, (b) other '''vulnerabilities''' (e.g., chronic illness, addiction, poor conflict management or communication beyond the focal risk may "pile-up" to present additional challenges; c) '''protection''' (factors or processes of resilience) must be distinguished from '''outcomes''' (short or long term indicators of resilience), (d) '''family situational meanings''' (how a family collectively perceives the risk, protection, and vulnerabilities) interact with risk, vulnerabilities, protection, and outcomes, (e) these all occur within '''family adaptive systems''' (patterns of interaction within families described as ''meaning systems, control systems, emotion systems, maintenance systems, stress-response systems'') and '''ecosystems'''. Thus, assessing resilience requires consideration of which component(s) the researcher is addressing. Further, measurement can occur at the level of the family-ecosystem (e.g., school-family, healthcare-family), overall family system, in family subsystems (e.g., couple relationships, sibling relationships, parent-child relationship, grandparent-grandchild relationship).&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt; Once the researcher clarifies which level(s) upon which they wish to focus, measures can be identified at the appropriate level.

The problem with a nebulous definition of family resilience is that it is difficult to measure without a concrete definition. Specific measurement tools of resilience include the Family Strengths and Resilience Scale, [[Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale]], the Resilience Scale and other self-report measures such as Brief Symptom Inventory, [[Child Behavior Checklist]], Child Depression Inventory, and Mental Health Inventories&lt;ref name="Windle" /&gt; have been most commonly used.

One can also measure all of the attributes and antecedents of family resilience individually to attempt to capture what it means to be resilient at a certain phase of a family developmental cycle. Protective factors that can be quantitatively measured include: celebrations, [[Psychological resilience|hardiness]], time together, [[:wikt:routine|routines]], [[traditions]], [[communication]], [[Personal finance|financial management]], and [[health]].&lt;ref name="Black &amp; Lobo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chapin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lester" /&gt; These factors have been most important when starting to understand the protective factors of resilience, versus the recovery factors, which are employed when the [[crisis]] or challenge has already occurred and the family needs to [[:wikt:adapt|adapt]].  Recovery factors include: [[coping (psychology)|coping]], [[social support]], family support, esteem building, [[optimism]], [[recreation]], [[:wikt:control|control]], [[organization]], [[flexibility]], and [[hope]]. These factors are dependent upon the type of [[family]] that utilizes them and the need for certain factors depending upon the type of stressor (e.g. normative or non-normative). In short, it is difficult to measure family resilience.

Card and Barnett (2015) discuss four key methodological issues in researching individual and family resilience: psychometric properties (reliability, validity, measurement equivalence), causality in the absence of experimental research, contrasting variable centered and person centered approaches, and the multilevel nature of family resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/fare.12102 | volume=64 | title=Methodological Considerations in Studying Individual and Family Resilience | journal=Family Relations | pages=120–133 | last1 = Card | first1 = Noel A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family resilience prevention and intervention==

Professionals who work with families may employ a variety of educational, therapeutic, or community-based approaches to helping protect families against adversity or facilitate the abilities of families to mobilize their strengths or gain new resources to successfully rebound from adversity (i.e., demonstrate resilience). Examples of such approaches are to inoculate against risk (or expose families to low levels of risk in preparation for potential greater risks), reducing risk, increasing resources, or changing meanings to make them more manageable, according to Henry et a. (2015).&lt;ref name="Henry et al." /&gt;

==In military families==

Recent literature has focused on identifying healthy [[coping (psychology)|coping]] and [[adaptation]] in [[military]] families.&lt;ref name="Saltzman" /&gt; With the current wars across the world, more military members are being [[Military deployment|deployed]] and are struggling with various issues such as: [[mental illness]], [[substance abuse]], difficulty with transitions, changes in roles, and ensuring their family is safe and healthy.&lt;ref name="Mansfield" /&gt; The families of these military members are not immune to these stressors.&lt;ref name="Lester" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lester &amp; Bursch" /&gt; The stress associated with the military can lead to [[Depression (mood)|depression]] if adequate coping mechanisms are not employed, or if the family does not possess the needed support or strength to adapt to stressors.

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] has collaborated with [[positive psychology]] scientists to create the [[Comprehensive Soldier Fitness]] program for members of the [[Army]]. More recently, the Family Skills Component of this program has been released for use by family members in the military.&lt;ref name="Chapin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottman" /&gt; New military, government, and [[public health]] initiatives are focused on fostering and promoting resilience in the military family overall. Initial results from [[pilot studies]] show that those who are resilient can better cope with stressors and are less likely to suffer from depression or alcohol use.&lt;ref name="Chapin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottman" /&gt;

The Comprehensive Soldier Fitness program in the U.S. Army is the first of its kind. With input from the positive psychology field, a program to increase the physical and psychological health of service members was implemented in 2009. The Family Skills Component of this program is meant to assist military spouses and family members to also increase their levels of resilience.

{{refimprove|date=July 2015}}
In [[physics]] or [[engineering]] [[education]], a '''Fermi problem''', '''Fermi quiz''', '''Fermi question''', '''Fermi estimate''', or '''order estimation''' is an [[Estimation theory|estimation]] problem designed to teach [[dimensional analysis]] or [[approximation]], and such a problem is usually a [[back-of-the-envelope calculation]]. The estimation technique is named after physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] as he was known for his ability to make good approximate calculations with little or no actual data. Fermi problems typically involve making justified guesses about quantities and their [[variance]] or lower and upper bounds.

== Historical background ==
An example is [[Enrico Fermi]]'s estimate of the strength of the [[atomic bomb]] that detonated at the [[Trinity test]], based on the distance traveled by pieces of paper he dropped from his hand during the blast.&lt;ref name=weapons-2-2005&gt;{{cite web|title=Eyewitnesses to Trinity|url=http://www.lanl.gov/science/weapons_journal/wj_pubs/11nwj2-05.pdf|work=Nuclear Weapons Journal, Issue 2 2005|publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory|accessdate=18 February 2014|page=45|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi's estimate of 10 kilotons of [[TNT]] was remarkably close to the now-accepted value of around 20 kilotons.

==Examples==
An example problem, of a type generally attributed to Fermi,&lt;ref&gt;Referred to as a Fermi problem in Lufkin, Dan. [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1396#more-1396 "Comment on 'Generalization and truth'"]. ''[[Language Log]]''{{reliable source|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is "How many [[piano tuner]]s are there in [[Chicago]]?" A typical solution to this problem involves multiplying a series of estimates that yield the correct answer if the estimates are correct.  For example, we might make the following assumptions:

# There are approximately 9,000,000 people living in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]].
# On average, there are two persons in each household in Chicago.
# Roughly one household in twenty has a piano that is tuned regularly.
# Pianos that are tuned regularly are tuned on average about once per year.
# It takes a piano tuner about two hours to tune a piano, including travel time.
# Each piano tuner works eight hours in a day, five days in a week, and 50 weeks in a year.

From these assumptions, we can compute that the number of piano tunings in a single year in Chicago is

:(9,000,000 persons in Chicago) ÷ (2 persons/household) × (1 piano/20 households) × (1 piano tuning per piano per year) = 225,000 piano tunings per year in Chicago.

We can similarly calculate that the average piano tuner performs

:(50 weeks/year) × (5 days/week) × (8 hours/day) ÷ (2 hours to tune a piano) = 1000 piano tunings per year.

Dividing gives

:(225,000 piano tunings per year in Chicago) ÷ (1000 piano tunings per year per piano tuner) = 225 piano tuners in Chicago.

In 2009, the actual number of piano tuners in Chicago was about 290.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?t=crmtb01&amp;f=ob&amp;i=how%20many%20piano%20tuners%20are%20in%20chicago&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous example of a Fermi-problem-like estimate is the [[Drake equation]], which seeks to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy.  The basic question of why, if there were a significant number of such civilizations, ours has never encountered any others is called the [[Fermi paradox]].

==Advantages and scope==
Scientists often look for Fermi estimates of the answer to a problem before turning to more sophisticated methods to calculate a precise answer. This provides a useful check on the results. While the estimate is almost certainly incorrect, it is also a simple calculation that allows for easy error checking, and to find faulty assumptions if the figure produced is far beyond what we might reasonably expect. By contrast, precise calculations can be extremely complex but with the expectation that the answer they produce is correct. The far larger number of factors and operations involved can obscure a very significant error, either in mathematical process or in the assumptions the equation is based on, but the result may still be assumed to be right because it has been derived from a precise formula that is expected to yield good results. Without a reasonable frame of reference to work from it is seldom clear if a result is acceptably precise or is many degrees of magnitude (tens or hundreds of times) too big or too small. The Fermi estimation gives a quick, simple way to obtain this frame of reference for what might reasonably be expected to be the answer, giving context to the results.

As long as the initial assumptions in the estimate are reasonable quantities, the result obtained will give an answer within the same scale as the correct result, and if not gives a base for understanding why this is the case. For example, if the estimate tells you there should be a hundred or so tuners but the precise answer tells you there are many thousands then you know you need to find out why there is this divergence from the expected result. First looking for errors, then for factors the estimation didn't take account of - Does Chicago have a number of music schools or other places with a disproportionately high ratio of pianos to people? Whether close or very far from the observed results, the context the estimation provides gives useful information both about the process of calculation and the assumptions that have been used to look at problems.

Fermi estimates are also useful in approaching problems where the optimal choice of calculation method depends on the expected size of the answer. For instance, a Fermi estimate might indicate whether the internal stresses of a structure are low enough that it can be accurately described by [[linear elasticity]]; or if the estimate already bears significant relationship in [[Scale (ratio)|scale]] relative to some other value, for example, if a structure will be over-engineered to withstand loads several times greater than the estimate.

Although Fermi calculations are often not accurate, as there may be many problems with their assumptions, this sort of analysis does tell us what to look for to get a better answer. For the above example, we might try to find a better estimate of the number of pianos tuned by a piano tuner in a typical day, or look up an accurate number for the population of Chicago.  It also gives us a rough estimate that may be good enough for some purposes: if we want to start a store in Chicago that sells piano tuning equipment, and we calculate that we need 10,000 potential customers to stay in business, we can reasonably assume that the above estimate is far enough below 10,000 that we should consider a different business plan (and, with a little more work, we could compute a rough upper bound on the number of piano tuners by considering the most extreme ''reasonable'' values that could appear in each of our assumptions).

== Explanation ==
Fermi estimates generally work because the estimations of the individual terms are often close to correct, and overestimates and underestimates help cancel each other out. That is, if there is no consistent bias, a Fermi calculation that involves the multiplication of several estimated factors (such as the number of piano tuners in Chicago) will ''probably'' be more accurate than might be first supposed.

In detail, multiplying estimates corresponds to adding their logarithms; thus one obtains a sort of [[Wiener process]] or [[random walk]] on the [[logarithmic scale]], which diffuses as {{sqrt|''n''}} (in number of terms ''n''). In discrete terms, the number of overestimates minus underestimates will have a [[binomial distribution]]. In continuous terms, if one makes a Fermi estimate of ''n'' steps, with [[standard deviation]] ''σ'' units on the log scale from the actual value, then the overall estimate will have standard deviation ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;{{sqrt|''n''}}&lt;/sup&gt;, since the standard deviation of a sum scales as {{sqrt|''n''}} in the number of summands.

For instance, if one makes a 9-step Fermi estimate, at each step overestimating or underestimating the correct number by a factor of 2 (or with a standard deviation 2), then after 9 steps the standard error will have grown by a logarithmic factor of {{sqrt|9}} = 3, so 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8. Thus one will expect to be within {{frac|8}} to 8 times the correct value – within an [[order of magnitude]], and much less than the worst case of erring by a factor of 2&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; = 512 (about 2.71 orders of magnitude). If one has a shorter chain or estimates more accurately, the overall estimate will be correspondingly better.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7609">'''Fiction Theory''' is a discipline that applies [[possible world]] theory to literature. Fiction theory scholars and critics have articulated various theses rooted in [[Saul Kripke]]’s application of [[modal logic]] to [[semantics]]. Drawing on concepts found in possible world theory, theorists of fiction study the relationships between textual worlds and the world outside the text.  The overarching idea in fiction theory is that the relationships between the imaginary worlds of fiction and the actual world in which we live are complicated, and that one ought not dismiss fiction as simply stories that are not “true.” Theorists of fiction pose challenging questions about, and offer constructive ways of exploring, the often complex relations between the worlds of fiction and the “real” world in which we live. 

== Fundamentals of fiction theory ==
In order to understand fiction theory, one must pose questions about fundamental terms such as text, narrative, literature, fiction, etc.  Literature may be understood as a text that is self-consciously artistic, rather than as a text that is used as a medium through which to convey information, for example a newspaper article. [[Roman Jakobson]], a Russian formalist and linguist, was one of the first individuals to discuss art as a way of communication that is intentionally aesthetic, and applied linguistics to analyses of literary texts. In his well-known communication model, Jakobson breaks apart a communicative act between an addressor and addressee into a message, code, context, and contact, with each part having its own function.  According to Jakobson’s model, art is created when the message itself (which carries the poetic function) is stressed. 

The French scholar [[Roland Barthes]] designed a system of [[five major codes]] that function as tools to analyze narrative texts in ways that move beyond examinations of plot and structure, thereby bringing to the surface the subtle ways a text becomes a literary narrative. 

Jakobson’s model and Barthes’s codes offer critics a way to begin to explore the nature of a literary text through application of [[semiotics]] to [[narrative]].

== The Actual versus the Fictive ==
While Jakobson and Barthes emphasize the intention of the speaker/writer, the philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]] examines the broader question of how we create imaginary worlds and categorizes our “Ways of Worldmaking” (the title of his book on this topic) into composition/decomposition, weighting, ordering, deletion/supplementation, and reformations. The scholar [[Marie-Laure Ryan]] is also concerned less with intention and more with the various ways that fictional worlds are related to the actual world outside the text. Ryan conceptualizes these relations in a framework of accessibility and has developed a typology of accessibility relations that establishes the extent to which fictional worlds are similar to or different from the actual world in which we live. The fictional world that most resembles the actual world is based on the “principle of minimal departure.” This idea was first articulated by [[John Searle]] and refers to the fundamental property of an imaginary world that is minimally different from the familiar world in which we live. Lubomir Dolezel has developed a similar typology based on [[modal operator]]s that determine the narrative world.

[[Frank Kermode]], in his seminal text ''[[The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the Theory of Fiction]]'', argues that ultimate meaning is derived from the end; successive events are predicated on previously established meaning.  He articulates a concept of fiction based on this view of humans’ constant yearning for an ultimate end that will imbue with meaning everything that preceded it. In this discussion, Kermode distinguishes between fiction and myth.  Fiction consists of stories all individuals create about their lives in order to keep on living in a world that makes few guarantees and is full of inexplicable phenomena. Kermode defines myth as a dangerous fiction used for exploitative purposes.  The philosopher [[Hans Vaihinger]] has articulated similar ideas, putting forth the biological argument that human beings use fictions to help survive in a hostile environment, and that these fictions are so useful that it becomes most difficult, if not impossible, for us to stop ourselves from creating fictions.  In Vaihinger’s language, fiction is something we treat “as if” it is true even when we know that it is not true, whereas myth is something we treat as true because we do not know it is false. 

Literary critic [[Thomas Pavel]] argues that the fictional world deserves to be examined on its own terms rather than merely through the lens of [[mimesis]].  His thesis serves as a critique of [[Structuralism]] by its insistence on the idea that narrativity, as a fundamental aspect of fiction, removes the possibility of pure imitation of the actual world.  Pavel’s theory thus departs from the main ideas of other fiction theorists because he separates literature from its referential relationship to the actual world. Following in the footsteps of the Austrian philosopher [[Alexius Meinong]], Pavel asserts that fictional worlds demand tremendous respect for their ability to serve as powerful tools of knowledge rather than for their likeness to the actual world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4179">'''Geomessaging''' is a technology that allows a person or system to send a message based on any media to a device that enters or exits one or more regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/ITST.2012.6425228|title=2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications|pages=497–501|year=2012|last1=Fujioka|first1=Masanobu|last2=Takahashi|first2=Masanori|last3=Matsumura|first3=Takeshi|last4=Chunmeng Wang|last5=Hirakoba|first5=Hiroyuki|isbn=978-1-4673-3070-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those regions can be created by using [[Geo-fence|geofences]], based on Latitude and Longitude, or adding beacons to the system associating those beacons with named locations. The device  will receive the message according to the rules defined by the campaign administrator (the person or system in charge of defining those locations and messages).

Rules can be: The minimum time to wait before resending a message, weekday, time range, etc.

The content of the message associated to those rules can be any images, text, html, metadata key-value pair, etc.

Increasingly geomessaging is finding its use in various applications including crisis communication and geo-location sensitive communication management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ugoround.com/white_papers/UgoRound-White-Paper-events-venue.pdf |title=Location Based Messaging for Events and Venue Crisis and Incident Management |publisher=UgoRound.com |date=21 July 2017 |accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geomessage Media==
Geomessage Media defines a [[Media (communication)|media]] genre where information or messages can be sent to recipients based on their location. Platforms that enable geo-notifications to a defined [[geo-fence]] would fall into the category of Geomessage Media. A geo-fence is a virtual radius or polygon defined by longitude and latitude coordinates on a map. Geofences are being used for a vast array of applications and services like reminder applications based on area, location sharing and localized advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Loyola L, Wong F, Pereira D ''et al.''|title=Proceedings of the Second ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Mobile Geographic Information Systems - MobiGIS '13|pages=51–58|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2534193|publisher=MobiGIS13| date=5 November 2016|accessdate=25 November 2016|doi=10.1145/2534190.2534193|isbn=9781450325318|chapter=Extending battery lifetime of mobile devices with geofence capabilities on dynamic-speed urban environments}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geomessage Media is a natural progression of information sent on Mass Media and Social Media. Geomessage Media platforms allow communicating or sending a geomessage to a hyper-local area. This allows for much more relevant, geo-contextual information to be sent. In some use cases the platforms allow messaging to an anonymised group, in a defined geolocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.shephertz.com/2016/05/05/geo-fencing-push-notifications-next-step-user-engagement |title=Geo-fencing in Push Notifications: The Next Step in User Engagement |publisher=ShepHertz |date=5 May 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other use cases include sending messages to a geolocation where members of a known group may enter. 

Circumstances where a Geomessage would benefit recipients are many, for example:
* Evacuations – instructions can be given to a localised area or areas to evacuate
* Transport Management - Commuters can be sent advice and information that may delay their commute
* Weather – recipients in the path of a weather event can be notified
* Place of Interest – people entering, exiting or even dwelling in a place could be sent a message.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5208">'''Global civics''' suggests to understand [[civics]] in a global sense as a [[social contract]] among all [[world citizen]]s in an age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=2010-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advocates of the notion attempt to demonstrate that it is possible to imagine global civics. According to this notion, in an increasingly interdependent world, the [[world citizen]]s need a compass that would frame mindsets on a global scale, and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility related to specific world issues such as environmental problems and nuclear proliferation.&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary? Feasible?| journal = Global Policy| date = June 2010| url = http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/articles/international-law-and-human-rights/global-civics-necessary-feasible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==

The term '''global civics''' was first coined by Hakan Altinay, a nonresident senior fellow with the Global Economy and Development program at the [[Brookings Institution]], in a working paper published in March 2010. The concept builds upon the basic tenets behind [[global ethics]], [[global justice]] and [[world citizenship]], inviting everyone to question their increasingly important role in a highly interdependent world. In early 2011, Altinay published ''Global Civics: Responsibilities and Rights in an Interdependent World,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title =Global Civics: Rights and Responsibilities in an Interdependent World| last=Altinay| first=Hakan| year = 2011 | publisher= Brookings Institution Press | location= Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book of articles on global civics put forth by academics and intellectuals all around the world.

==Objections to the concept==
Opponents of the global civics concept argue that even a modest level of exercising responsibility towards all the people living in the world is so overwhelming and nearly impossible to achieve. These arguments also posit that [[civics]] assumes an effective state and enforcement. The claim goes that since there is no such thing as a [[world government]], global civics implementation is not feasible. Also, it has been suggested that superpowers of the world are selfish and dangerous nations, and that they do not feel constrained by international legitimacy and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dangerous Nations|last= Kagan|first= Robert|year= 2006 | publisher= Alfred A. Knopf | location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the critics claim that any experience of pan-global solidarity among human beings cannot form the basis of constellation of rights and responsibilities as it is nascent at best and the experience of being a global citizen is a privilege restricted to international elites and a few activists.&lt;ref name = feasible/&gt;

==The role of universities==

The proponents of global civics also suggest that university campuses play a vital role in spreading a thorough understanding of how today's global world functions and contributes toward preparation of future generations for life in an interdependent world. This view calls for visionary universities that could successfully "provide their students with the forums and the tools to discuss and figure out what their responsibilities are to their fellow human beings." &lt;ref name = case/&gt;

{{Sexual orientation}}
The '''heterosexual–homosexual continuum''' or the '''sexual orientation continuum''' is a psychological and philosophical understanding of human sexuality that places [[sexual orientation]] on a [[Continuum (theory)|continuous]] [[spectrum]] from [[heterosexuality]] to [[homosexual orientation|homosexuality]], with sexuality ranging from exclusive attraction to the opposite sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex.

This concept stems from [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s 1940s surveys of sexuality; significant numbers of Kinsey's subjects reported [[bisexuality]] of varying degrees, rather than the strict heterosexual/homosexual division that had been previously assumed. This work was expanded by [[Fritz Klein (sex researcher)|Fritz Klein]], who hypothesized that sexual orientation was a dynamic, multi-variable process, involving [[Attractiveness|attraction]], [[behavior]], [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]], emotional and [[social preferences]], [[self-identification]], and [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].&lt;ref name="uis"&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://www.uis.edu/studentaffairs/safezone/resources/documents/Sexuality%20Continuum.pdf |title=Continuum of Human Sexuality |publisher=University of Illinois, Springfield |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110091528/http://www.uis.edu/studentaffairs/safezone/resources/documents/Sexuality%20Continuum.pdf |archivedate=2011-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This continuum was an important influence on the [[feminism|feminist]] and [[LGBT social movements|gay-rights]] movements of the 1970s and 1980s as academics and movement leaders tried to distinguish between one's sex—e.g. being male or female—and the social, cultural, and psychological aspects of gender and sexuality.

According to a 2005 statement by the [[American Psychological Association]]:
{{quote|Sexual orientation is an enduring emotional, romantic, sexual, or affectionate attraction toward others. It is easily distinguished from other components of sexuality including biological sex, [[gender identity]] (the psychological sense of being male or female), and the social [[gender role]] (adherence to cultural norms for feminine and masculine behavior).

Sexual orientation exists along a continuum that ranges from exclusive heterosexuality to exclusive homosexuality and includes various forms of [[bisexuality]].&lt;ref name=uis /&gt;}}

People who disagree with this interpretation of human sexual orientation are said to believe in a "heterosexual–homosexual dichotomy".&lt;ref&gt;McConaghy, Nathaniel. "Heterosexuality/homosexuality: Dichotomy or continuum." Archives of sexual behavior 16.5 (1987): 411-424.&lt;/ref&gt;

Headquartered in the heart of [[Paris]], [[France]], '''Institut Choiseul''' for International Politics and Geoeconomics is an independent research center that analyzes [[international relations]], economic and political strategies as well as international cultures.

==Theoretical background==
The French [[think tank]] contributes to the massive body of international relations studies by examining the new balance of global power prevalent in the [[post-Cold War era]] from a [[geoeconomics]] perspective: a perspective which compliments the traditional vision of the international order as primarily [[geopolitical]]. In this respect, the institute conforms to the thought of French [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]] and [[political scientist]] [[Raymond Aron]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.choiseul.info/missions-valeurs.php?lang=uk&amp;PHPSESSID=5b70f574edc21682ed10e51cadd2b0a4 Institut Choiseul – Valeurs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution to international relations==
In 1997, then named the "European Institute of Geoeconomics", the Institute created an academic journal of the same name, entitled ''Geoeconomics'' (in French, ''[[:fr:Géoéconomie|Géoéconomie]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.choiseul-editions.com/choiseul-editions.html Editions Choiseul : revues économiques et géopolitiques&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that broadened the field of international relations in adding to the discourse a consideration for economics as a powerful force involved in shaping inter-state and political interactions. The research and activities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.choiseul.info/activites.php Institut Choiseul – Activités&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; of the institute equally seek to link the theoretical world with current events, and also seek to provide a European vision into the major geopolitical and economic issues. [[Pascal Lorot]] has been president of Institut Choiseul since 2003.

==Publications==
Institut Choiseul currently publishes five other academic journals, in addition to ''Géoéconomie'':
*''Maghreb-Machrek'' ([[Maghreb|Northern Africa]] and [[Mashriq|the Arab world]])
*''Problèmes d'Amérique latine'' ([[Latin American studies|Problems of Latin America]])
*''Monde chinois'' ([[Sinophone world]])
*''Politique américaine'' ([[American politics]])
*''Nordiques'' ([[Nordic countries]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2600">The '''Institute of African Studies''' on the Anne Jiagee road on campus of the [[University of Ghana]] at [[Legon]] is an interdisciplinary research institute in the humanities and social sciences. It was established by President [[Kwame Nkrumah]] in 1962 to encourage [[African studies]].

[[Thomas Lionel Hodgkin]] served as the first Director, from 1962 to 1965. On 25 October 1963 President Kwame Nkrumah gave an inaugural address at the Institute, entitled "The African Genius", in which he called for the recovery of African traditions and an African-centered approach to knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Botwe-Asamoah, ''Kwame Nkrumah's Politico-Cultural Thought and Policies: an African-centered paradigm for the second phase of the African revolutions'', Routledge, 2005, ch. 7, "Nkrumah's cultural policy: the national theater movement and the academy".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daryl Zizwe Poe, ''Kwame Nkrumah's Contribution to Pan-Africanism: an Afrocentric analysis'', Routledge, 2003, pp. 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
*The Institute of African Studies is located on the main Legon campus of the [[University of Ghana]]. The Institute has an old site and a new site. The New Site, 100 meters from the main entrance to the Legon campus, houses the Institute's administration and the offices of most of its faculty members.
 
*The Old Site houses the Institute's Library, Printing Unit, Publications Unit and Store, Offices for the Ghana Dance Ensemble and the J. H. Kwabena Nketia Archives,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ug.edu.gh/news/ias-archives-named-after-emeritus-prof-jh-kwabena-nketia "IAS Archives Named After Emeritus Prof. J.H.

The '''Iron Ring''' is a ring worn by many [[Canadians|Canadian]]-trained [[engineer]]s, as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and [[engineering ethics|ethics]] associated with their profession. From a concept originated in 1922,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironring.ca Origin of the Iron Ring concept]&lt;/ref&gt; the ring is presented to graduates in a closed ceremony known as [[The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]],&lt;ref name="ritual"&gt;"[http://www.ironring.ca/background.php The Calling of an Engineer]", ''[[The Corporation of the Seven Wardens]]'', Retrieved November 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HPa&gt;Petroski 2012, p.187.&lt;/ref&gt;  developed with the assistance of English poet [[Rudyard Kipling]].&lt;ref name="ritual"/&gt;

The ring symbolizes the pride which engineers have in their profession, while simultaneously reminding them of their humility. The ring serves as a reminder to the engineer and others of the engineer's obligation to live by a high standard of professional conduct. It is not a symbol of qualification as an engineer – this is determined by the provincial and territorial licensing bodies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.camp1.ca/wordpress/?page_id=2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Material and design ==

The Iron Ring is made from either [[iron]] or [[stainless steel]].&lt;ref name="ringceremony"/&gt; The first ceremony awarding the ring was held in 1925, under the supervision of [[Herbert E. T. Haultain]], professor of mining engineering  at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name=HPa /&gt;

The rings are given in ceremonies held at individual universities, each assigned one of 26 camps of the [[Corporation of the Seven Wardens]]. Because iron deteriorates turning the finger black and making the ring fit more loosely, all camps except [[Toronto]] have stopped conferring rings made of iron and have switched to stainless steel rings.  At the Toronto camp, the individual ceremonies held at the [[University of Toronto]], [[University of Ottawa]], [[Ryerson University]], [[York University]] and the [[University of Ontario Institute of Technology]], continue to provide recipients with a choice of rings made of iron or stainless steel.

Many incorrectly believe that the rings are made from the steel of a beam from the first [[Quebec Bridge]], which collapsed during construction in 1907. Seventy-five construction workers died in the collapse which was attributed to poor planning and design by the overseeing engineers.&lt;ref name="iron_ring"&gt;"[http://www.eir.ca/engineers/ironring.php?link=4 The Iron Ring ]", Engineer-in-Residence, ''[[Professional Engineers Ontario]]'', Retrieved November 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rudyard Kipling]], who wrote the ritual obligation,&lt;ref name="ritual"/&gt; indicated that the Ring as an allegory in itself be rough, not smoothed, and hammered, and as a ring have no beginning nor end.  There is no evidence that there is any particular history in the source of "Cold Iron" (from the Calling of the Engineer ceremony) for the Ring, nor any intention that there should have been. Remnants of the Quebec Bridge legend still exist in Canada.&lt;ref name=HPa /&gt;&lt;ref name="ringceremony"&gt;J. Jeswiet, "[http://www.networx.on.ca/~njdevil/mainpage/E_Eng/Academic/jj-ring.htm Information Relevant to the Iron Ring Ceremony]", November 22, 2001; Retrieved November 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iron Ring is worn on the [[little finger]] ("[[pinky ring|pinky]]") of the working (dominant) hand.&lt;ref name="ringceremony"/&gt; There, the facets act as a sharp reminder of one's obligation while the engineer works, because it could drag on the writing surface while the engineer is drawing or writing. This is particularly true of recently obligated engineers, whose rings bear sharp, unworn, facets. Protocol dictates that the rings should be returned by retired engineers or by the families of deceased engineers.  Some camps offer previously obligated or "experienced" rings, but they are now rare due to medical and practical complications.

The Ring itself is small and understated, designed as a constant reminder, rather than a piece of jewelry. The Rings were originally hammered manually with a rough outer surface.  The modern machined ring design is unique, a reminder of the manual process. Twelve half-circle facets are carved into the top and bottom of the outer surface, with the two sets of facets offset rotationally by fifteen degrees.

The [[Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]] is the ceremony where Iron Rings are given to graduating engineers who choose to obligate themselves to the highest professionalism and humility of their profession. It is a symbol that reflects the moral, ethical and professional commitment made by the engineer who wears the ring.  The ceremonies are private affairs with no publicity. Invitations to attend are extended to local engineering alumni and professional engineers by those who are scheduled to participate. For some schools, the invitation to witness the ceremony is open to anyone in the engineering profession, and non-obligated engineers may not participate in the ritual.  Some graduating engineers choose to receive a ring passed on from a relative or mentor, giving the ceremony a personal touch.

== Adoption in the United States ==
[[File:Order of the Engineer Ring (Macro).jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|An example of a plain stainless steel band issued by the [[Order of the Engineer]] in the United States]]

Based upon the success of the Iron Ring in Canada, a similar program was created in the [[United States]], where the [[Order of the Engineer]]&lt;ref name="order"&gt;"[http://www.order-of-the-engineer.org/ About The Order]", ''[[Order of the Engineer]]'', Retrieved November 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1970. The organization conducts similar ring ceremonies at a number of U.S. colleges, in which the recipient signs an "Obligation of the Engineer"&lt;ref name="oblige"&gt;"[http://www.asce.org/uploadedFiles/Leadership_Training_-_New/OBLIGATION.pdf Obligation of the Engineer]", ''[[American Society of Civil Engineers]]''; Retrieved November 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and receives a stainless steel [[Engineer's Ring]] (which, unlike the Canadian Iron Ring, can be smooth and not faceted). The first such ceremony occurred on June 4, 1970, at the [[Cleveland State University]] under the supervision of Lloyd Chancy.&lt;ref name=HPb&gt;Petroski 2012, p.175-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Istihlal''' ({{lang-ar|استحلال}} ''istiḥlāl'') is a term used in [[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]], or [[fiqh]], to refer to the act of regarding some action as permissible, or [[halaal]], although it is [[haraam]]; the implication is that such a regard is an erroneous and improper distortion of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].  The word "istihlal" is derived as [[Arabic grammar#Stem formation|Stem X]] of the Arabic [[consonantal root]] ح-ل-ل meaning "to untie", "to solve", "to dissolve", "to open", "to release", etc. &lt;ref name=wehrcowan&gt;Hans Wehr. ''[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic|A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]]: Third Edition''.  ed. [[J. Milton Cowan]].  Spoken Language Services, Inc.  [[Ithaca, New York]], 1976.  {{ISBN|0-87950-001-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "istihlal" came to prominence in the Western news media on 11 March 2005, the first anniversary of the [[11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings|Madrid bombing attacks of 2004]], when the [[Islamic Commission of Spain]] (La Comisión Islámica de España) issued a [[fatwa]], or religious opinion, denouncing [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[al-Qaeda]] for engaging in istihlal with respect to the waging of [[jihad]] through [[terrorism]], and the killing of women, children, and noncombatants. &lt;ref name=CNN2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/03/11/madrid.anniversary/ |title=Bin Laden fatwa as Spain remembers |ref=CNN2005 |accessdate=2005-08-17 |publisher=[[Cable News Network|CNN]] |date=2005-03-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050711083154/http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/03/11/madrid.anniversary/ |archivedate=2005-07-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant passages from the fatwa are as follows: &lt;ref name=webislam&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webislam.com/?idn=399 |title=La Comisión Islámica de España emite una fatua condenando el terrorismo y al grupo Al Qaida |accessdate=2008-08-30 |publisher=WebIslam Comunidad Virtual |language=Spanish |date=2005-03-05 }} Full text of the fatwa issued by La Comisión Islámica de España against Osama bin Laden and Al Qa'ida.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Que según la Sharia, todo aquel que declara ''halal'' o permitido lo que Dios ha declarado ''haram'' o prohibido, como es matar a personas inocentes en atentados terroristas, se convierte en ''Kafir Murtadd Mustahlil'', es decir en apóstata, por haber pretendido hacer ''halal'' (''istihlal'') el asesinato de inocentes, crimen que el Sagrado Corán y la Sunna del Profeta Muhammad, Dios le bendiga y salve, prohíben expresamente.''

:''En tanto que Osama ben Laden y su organización defienden la legalidad del terrorismo y pretenden fundamentarla en el sagrado Corán y la Sunna, están cometiendo delito de ''istihlal'' y se convierten ipso facto en apóstatas (''kafir murtadd''), que no deben ser considerados musulmanes ni ser tratados como tales.''

:''That according to the [[Sharia]], anyone who declares ''[[halaal]]'', or permitted, what God has declared ''[[haraam]]'', or forbidden, such as the killing of innocent persons in terrorist attacks, turns into a ''[[Kafir]] [[Murtadd]] Mustahlil'', that is to say, an [[apostate]], by having claimed to make ''[[halal]]'' (''istihlal'') the murder of innocents, a crime that the Holy [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]] of the Prophet [[Muhammad]] (may God bless and save him) expressly forbid.''

:''Insofar as Osama bin Laden and his organization defend the legality of terrorism and claim to base it in the Holy Qur'an and the Sunnah, they are committing the sin of ''istihlal'' and become ipso facto apostates (''kafir murtadd''), who should not be considered [[Muslims]] nor be treated as such.''

'''Izidor (Iso) Kršnjavi''' ({{IPA-sh|krʃɲǎːʋi ǐzidor|hr}}, 22 April 1845 – 3 February 1927) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] painter, art historian, curator and politician.

==Biography==
Born in [[Našice]], his first art lessons were obtained in [[Osijek]], where he studied with [[Hugo Conrad von Hötzendorf]].&lt;ref name="GLN"&gt;[http://www.galerija-lavalnugent.com/krsnjavi-izidor-1845-1924 Galerija Laval Nugent: Izidor Kršnjavi]&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to Vienna to study philosophy and [[art history]]. At this time, he was already providing aesthetic and philosophical articles to Croatian journals. He later studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]] and lived in Italy from 1872–77, where he copied the old masters.

With the help of [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]], who he had met in Rome, he became a professor of archaeology and art history at the [[University of Zagreb]]. The next year, he helped establish the Society of Arts, and was, for many years, it secretary and spokesman. He also served as the first Director of the [[Strossmayer Gallery of Old Masters]] and was one of the founders of the [[Museum of Arts and Crafts, Zagreb|Museum of Arts and Crafts]].&lt;ref name="GLN" /&gt;

In 1884, he came into conflict with Strossmayer and his supporters in the [[People's Party (Kingdom of Croatia)|People's Party]], where he supported the pro-Hungarian faction, which allowed him to serve in the Croatian Parliament 1884-87. From 1887 to 1891, he studied law and became the Minister of Education and Religion in the [[Károly Khuen-Héderváry]] administration. While in that office, he established several schools, including one for the blind and deaf, introduced [[physical education]] classes and helped to form the foundation for a unified school system. He had to leave the ministry in 1897, after a protest in which he burned a Hungarian flag. He returned to the University and, in 1906, joined the [[Party of Rights]]. Shortly thereafter, he began painting again.

In addition to being a painter and critic, he also translated [[Dante's Divine Comedy]] into Croatian and was the author of poems, travelogues and two novels. He died in [[Zagreb]].

In Croatian film ''[[Countess Dora]]'' (1993) he is played by [[Relja Bašić]].

The '''John C. Stennis Space Center''' ('''SSC''') is a [[NASA]] rocket testing facility. It is located in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]] ([[United States]]), on the banks of the [[Pearl River (Mississippi–Louisiana)|Pearl River]] at the [[Mississippi]]–[[Louisiana]] border. {{as of|2012}}, it is NASA's largest [[rocket engine test facility]]. There are over 30 local, state, national, international, private, and public companies and agencies using SSC for their rocket testing facilities.

== History ==
The initial requirements for NASA's proposed rocket testing facility required the site to be located between the rockets' manufacturing facility at [[Michoud Assembly Facility]] in eastern [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], and the launch facility at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in Florida.  Also, the site required barge access as the rocket motors to be tested for Apollo were too large for overland transport. Additionally, the Apollo motors were too loud to be tested at [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]'s existing test stands near [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. A more isolated site was needed.

After an exhaustive site selection process that included reviews of other coastal locations including [[Eglin Air Force Base]] in Florida plus islands in both the Caribbean and the Pacific, NASA announced formation of the Mississippi Test Facility (now known as Stennis Space Center) on Oct. 25, 1961, for testing engines for the Apollo Program. A high-terrace area bordering the East Pearl River in Hancock County, Miss., was selected for its location. NASA entrusted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with the difficult task to procure each land parcel either by directly purchasing the land or through acquisition of a perpetual easement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/centers/stennis/pdf/697602main_October_12_Lagniappe.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The selected area was thinly populated and met all other requirements; however before construction began, five small communities (Gainesville, Logtown, Napoleon, Santa Rosa, and Westonia), plus the northern portion of a sixth ([[Pearlington, Mississippi|Pearlington]]), and a combined population of 700 families had to be completely relocated off the facility. The effort acquired more than 3,200 parcels of privately owned land – 786 residences, 16 churches, 19 stores, three schools and a wide assortment of commercial buildings, including nightclubs and community centers.  Remnants of the communities, including city streets and a one-room school house, still exist within the facility.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The  {{convert|13500|acre|km2|0}} site was selected on October 25, 1961 on the '''Mississippi Test Facility''' or Pearl River Site.  On December 18, 1961 NASA officially designated the facility as NASA '''Mississippi Test Operations'''.  The test area (officially known as the Fee Area) is surrounded by a 125,000 acre (506&amp;nbsp;km²) acoustical [[buffer zone]]. The facility's large concrete and metal rocket propulsion test stands were originally used to test-fire the first and second stages of the [[Saturn V]] rockets. The facility was renamed again to '''Mississippi Test Facility''' on July 1, 1965, became a part of the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]]

Starting in 1971, all [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]s were flight-certified at Stennis.  On June 14, 1974 the site was renamed '''National Space Technology Laboratories''', a name that continued until May 20, 1988 when it was renamed for Mississippi senator and space program supporter [[John C. Stennis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=May 1961 speech leads to Stennis facility|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/stennis/pdf/546006main_May_11_Lagniappe.pdf|newspaper=Lagniappe|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the end of the Apollo and Shuttle programs, use of the base decreased, with economic impact to the surrounding communities. Over the years other government organizations and commercial entities have moved to and left from the facility, in the balance providing a major economic benefit to the communities.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The Rocket Propulsion Test Complex is a rocket testing complex which was built in 1965 as a component of the John C. Stennis Space Center. The Rocket Propulsion Test Complex played an important role in the development of the [[Saturn V]] rocket. The A-1, A-2 and B-1/B-2 test stands were declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Rocket Propulsion Test Complex / A-1/A-2 B-1/B-2 Test Stands|url={{NHLS url|id=85002805}} |format=pdf|date=May 15, 1984 |author=Harry A.

=== A-1/A-2 Test stand ===

 [[File:Aerial View SSC A-1, A-2 and B test stands 2004.jpg|thumb|left|A-1 test stand(foreground), A-2 (mid-ground)  and B1/B2 (background)]]
The smaller two of the original three test stands at Stennis Space Center, the A-1 and A-2 stands were built to test and flight-certify the second stage of the [[Saturn V]], the [[S-II]] (pronounced "ess two"), the launch vehicle for the [[Apollo program]]. The two stands are similar steel and concrete structures are roughly {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, and capable of withstanding thrust loads of more than 1 million pounds and temperature of up to {{convert|6,000|F|C|abbr=on|lk=on}}. Each test stand can provide liquid [[Hydrogen]] (LH2) and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) in addition to support fluids, gaseous [[helium]] (GHe), gaseous [[hydrogen]] (GH2) and gaseous [[nitrogen]] (GN2) as [[purge]] or [[pressurizing]] gasses.

Construction began in 1963 and was finished in 1966. The A Test Complex also includes a Test Control Center, observation bunkers, and various technical and support systems.

==== 1960s ====

On 23 April 1966 workmen at the A-2 test stand  successfully captive-fired for 15 seconds the S-II-T, Structural and Dynamic Test Vehicle for the Saturn V second stage, in an all-systems test. This was the first test of a flight-weight S-II stage. The stage, largest and most powerful liquid oxygen-liquid hydrogen stage known, developed one million pounds of thrust from its five [[Rocketdyne J-2]] engines. This test also marked the first operational use of the A-2 stand.&lt;ref name=ESDTest/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Press Release No. 66-83, Apr. 21, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

The first full-duration firing of the S-II flight stage occurred 20 May 1966 when S-II-T test-fired on the A-2 test stand for 354.5 seconds. LOX cutoff sensors initiated cutoff automatically. The firing passed all major test objectives with the exception of the propellant utilization system. This was the fourth static firing of the S-II-T. The stage developed one million pounds of thrust from its five hydrogen-oxygen-powered J-2 engines.&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"&gt;MSFC Saturn V Prog. Off., Saturn V QPR, Apr. 1-June 30, 1966, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== S-II-T rupture ====

A static test version of the Saturn V second stage S-II-T ruptured during pressure tests at SSC on 28 May 1966, and five North American Aviation technicians monitoring the test received minor injuries. The accident occurred when the hydrogen fuel tank failed under pressure. S-II-T, which had five hydrogen-oxygen J-2 engines capable of generating one million pounds of thrust, had been tested May 25 in ground firing but stopped firing after 195 seconds when a hydrogen link leak caused automatic cutoff. At time of the explosion, technicians were trying to determine cause for the hydrogen leak. No hydrogen was in the tank when the explosion occurred. Under the direction of MSFC, a Board of Inquiry headed by Dr. Kurt H. Debus, Director of Kennedy Space Center, convened on the night of May 28. Immediate investigation revealed that the second shift crew, not knowing that the liquid hydrogen pressure sensors and switches had been disconnected, had attempted to pressurize the tank. Believing that a liquid hydrogen vent valve was leaking, the technicians closed the facility by blocking valves. This had caused the vehicle tank to become over-pressurized and burst. On 30 May 1966 the board released its findings after two days of inquiry. The fuel tank of the S-II stage had been pressurized beyond design limits. There was a need for tighter controls over MTF test procedure. Following the destruction of S-II-T, NASA extended the S-II battleship program until July 1967&lt;ref name="autogenerated19"/&gt;

S-II-1, the first flight S-II stage scheduled for static firing at MTF, left Seal Beach on July 31, 1966.

The first flight model (S-II-1) of the Saturn V vehicle's second stage arrived August 13, 1966 at MTF completing its 4,000-mile voyage from Seal Beach. Workmen immediately moved the stage into the S-II stage service and checkout building for inspection and preparation for static firing.

At MTF on December 1, 1966 North American Aviation conducted a successful 384-second captive firing of five J-2 engines, the first flight hydrogen-fueled engines, developing a total one million pounds of thrust. During the test, number 2 and 4 engine SLAM arms did not drop, resulting in the successful gimballing of engines 1 and 3 only. The test included the recording of about 800 measurements of the stage's performance, including propellant tank temperatures, engine temperatures, propellant flow rates, and vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Press Release No. 66-228, Nov. 30, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 30, 1966, MSFC technicians at the MTF test stand conducted a static firing of the first flight version of the Saturn V second stage, S-II-1. This second test firing, like an earlier firing, lasted more than six minutes.&lt;ref&gt;MSFC, MAF Hist. Report, Jan. 1-Dec. 31, 1966, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1967 ====

On January 11, 1967 initial post-static checkout of the S-II-1 stage ended at MTF.&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Saturn V Prog. Off., Saturn V Semiannual Prog. Report, Jan. 1-June 30, 1967, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

on January 27, 1967 the S-II-2 stage left Seal Beach, California, to pass through the Panama Canal and on to MTF. After its journey lasting 16 days, the S-II would arrive at MTF for two static tests.

The S-II-2 stage arrived on dock at MTF on February 11, 1967. The S-II-2 stage, part of the second Saturn V vehicle (AS-502) scheduled for launch from KSC late in 1967, was scheduled for testing at MTF late in March 1967.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1967"&gt;MTF, Historical Report, Jan. 1-Dec. 31, 1967, (draft)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Saturn V Weekly Report, No. 8," Feb. 21, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 1967 the first full-duration test of a cluster of uprated J-2 engines, S-II battleship test No. 041, lasted 360 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Saturn V Prog. Off., Saturn V Semiannual Prog. Report, Jan. 1-June 30, 1967, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 1967 workmen at MTF completed construction of the S-II A-1 test stand, and the Corps of Engineers accepted beneficial occupancy with exceptions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1967"/&gt;

On March 17, 1967 technicians fired the S-II battleship stage for a mainstage duration of 29 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[Test Lab., Monthly Progress Report, Mar. 1967, p. 19.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, failure of a prevalve to close caused program officials at MTF to scrub the first attempt to static fire the S-II-2 stage.&lt;ref&gt;[ "Saturn IB Weekly Notes 13-67," April 3, 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

Battleship testing of the S-II battleship test stage equipped with five uprated J-2 engines ended in late March 1967 with a full-duration test of approximately 360 seconds mainstage operation.&lt;ref&gt;[NAA S&amp;ID, S-II Quarterly Progress Report, April–June 1967, p. II-6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Summary ====

These two test stands tested and flight-certified S-II stages and J-2 engines until the end of the Apollo program in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=ESDTest&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sscfreedom.ssc.nasa.gov/esd/ESDTestFacilitiesA1.asp | title = A-1 Test Stand | publisher = NASA | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090320094910/http://sscfreedom.ssc.nasa.gov/esd/ESDTestFacilitiesA1.asp | archivedate = 2009-03-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1970s ====

It was announced in 1971 that the center would be performing tests on the engines for the new [[Space Shuttle]] program (called the [[SSME]]). The A-1 and A-2 test stands, originally designed to accommodate the much larger S-II engines, were modified to accept the smaller SSME, and testing officially began on May 19, 1975 when the first such engine was tested on the A-1 stand. The center continued to test engines for the duration of the shuttle program, on the A-1 and A-2 stands with the final scheduled test occurred on July 29, 2009 on the A-2 stand.

==== 2010s ====

As the shuttle program is phased out, the A-1 and A-2 test stands are seeing new use testing the next generation of rocket engines, including the [[J-2X]] engine designed to power the SLS upper stage, with the first such test occurring on December 18, 2007.

Stennis is continuing to test Aerojet Rocketdyne AJ26 rocket engines for Orbital Sciences Corp. of Dulles, Va., which has partnered with NASA to provide commercial cargo flights to the International Space Station. Orbital's maiden flight to the space station launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia Sept. 18. Orbital's Antares rocket was powered by a pair of AJ26 engines.&lt;ref name=13-311/&gt;

=== B-1/B-2 Test stand ===
The B-1/B-2 test stand is a dual-position, vertical, static-firing stand supporting a maximum dynamic load of  11M lbf. It was originally built in the 1960s to simultaneously test the five [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] engines of a complete Saturn-V S1-C first stage from 1967 to 1970. During the shuttle era it was modified to test the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]] (SSME). Stennis now leases the B-1 test position to [[Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne]] for testing of [[RS-68]] engines for the [[Delta IV]] launch vehicle. NASA is preparing the B-2 test position to test the core stage of NASA's [[Space Launch System]] (SLS) in late 2016 and early 2017. The SLS core stage, with four [[RS-25D]] rocket engines, will be installed on the stand for propellant fill and drain testing and two hot-fire tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/multimedia/gallery/b2stand_3.html | title=B1/B2 Test Stand | publisher=NASA | date=29 April 2013 | accessdate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 1966 MSFC shipped its S-IC all-system test booster, S-IC-T, to SSC for use in checkout of a static test stand and for use in static firings. Workmen loaded the huge booster aboard the barge Poseidon for the 1,000-mile river journey. Six days later the S-IC-T reached SSC. All future firings would be accomplished at the B-2 stand at MTF.&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Saturn V Prog. Off., Saturn V Semiannual Prog. Report, July 1-Dec. 31, 1966, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

An all-systems test version of Apollo/Saturn V first stage, S-IC-T, went into the B-2 test stand at the Mississippi Test Facility on December 17, 1966. Stage electrical and mechanical hook-up to the test stand began immediately. Static firing would occur in early 1967 to demonstrate the facility checkout system.&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Press Release No. 66-294, Dec. 13, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1967 ====

On 13 February 1967 Corps of Engineers personnel completed construction of the S-IC B-2 test stand at MTF.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1967"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Memo, Sneed to NASA Headquarters, "Saturn V Weekly Report, No. 8," Feb. 21, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an extensive systems, subsystems, and total integrated systems checkout of the B-2 test stand at MTF on March 3, 1967, workmen successfully fired the S-IC battleship/all-systems stage (S-IC-T) for 15 seconds. This S-IC-T test, the first MTF S-IC firing, proved the total compatibility of stage, mechanical support equipment, and S-IC test facilities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1967"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MSFC Saturn V Prog. Off., Saturn V Semiannual Prog. Report, Jan. 1-June 30, 1967, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second S-IC-T firing lasted for 60 seconds on March 17, 1967. This firing validated the flame-bucket-water-flow pattern of the B-2 test stand and ended the facilities checkout test series at MTF.&lt;ref&gt;[MTF, Historical Report, Jan. 1-Dec. 31, 1967]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[MSFC Saturn V Prog. Off., Saturn V Semiannual Prog. Report, Jan. 1-June 30, 1967, p. 19.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Boeing personnel removed the S-IC-T from test stand B-2 at MTF on March 24, 1967, following post-static checkout, test stand refurbishment, and facilities modification.&lt;ref&gt;[NAA S&amp;ID, S-II Quarterly Progress Report, Jan.-Mar. 1967, p. II-16.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A-3 Test stand ===
NASA has begun construction of the new A-3 test stand at SSC.&lt;ref&gt;

The A-3 stand may however, be able to be refurnished to test a new mission when needed. In 2014, journalists writing for [[Bloomberg News]] and the [[Washington Times]] criticized the continued construction work on the $350 million A-3 Test stand, and characterized it as a wasteful [[earmark (politics)|earmark]] by Mississippi U.S. Senator [[Roger F. Wicker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-08/congress-makes-nasa-finish-useless-350-million-structure.html | work=Bloomberg | first=Jonathan D | last=Salant | title=Congress Makes NASA Finish Useless $350 Million Structure | date=January 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/30/golden-hammer-350-million-nasa-project-to-be-compl/|title=Golden Hammer: $350 million NASA project to be completed, then mothballed because of lack of need|first=The Washington Times|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E Test stand complex ===
[[File:E Test Stand at SSC.jpg|thumb|left|E test stand complex in 2005]]
In the 1990s, a new test complex named "E" was constructed to test a variety of new small engine and single/multiple components and concepts. The E test stand complex consists of four distinct test stands

==== E1 Test stand ====

As of early June 2014, the E-1 test stand is non-operational pending the completion of an investigation into a rocket engine failure on the test stand on 22 May 2014.&lt;ref name=nsf20140610/&gt;

===== History =====

In 2012, [[Blue Origin]] tested the thrust chamber assembly at the E-1 test cell for its new {{convert|100000|lbf|kN}} thrust [[BE-3]] liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket engine. As part of Blue's Reusable Booster System (RBS), the engines are designed eventually to launch the biconic-shaped Space Vehicle{{clarify|date=October 2013}}&lt;!-- is this a proper noun? yes --&gt; the company is developing.&lt;ref name=13-311 &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2013/october/nasa-administrator-visits-stennis-to-commend-employee-efforts/#.Um4CSRAt2M0 |title=NASA Administrator Visits Stennis to Commend Employee Efforts &amp;#124; NASA |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2013-10-23 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sn20131025/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/blue-origin-be3.html |title=NASA - Blue Origin Tests Rocket Engine Thrust Chamber |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2014, an [[NK-33#Aerojet AJ26|AJ26]] rocket engine under test on the Stennis E-1 test stand, for a future [[Orbital Sciences]] [[Antares (rocket)|Antares]] launch, failed and caused major damage to the E-1 test stand.  As of 10 June, neither NASA, Orbital, nor [[Aerojet Rocketdyne]] have released any additional information on the extent of the damage, nor time frame when the three test cells in the E-1 test stand will return to operational status.&lt;ref name=nsf20140610&gt;

In June 2015, [[Aerojet Rocketdyne]] signed a contract with NASA to upgrade the E-1 test stand so that the "multi-element pre-burner and main injector" of the [[AR-1 (rocket engine)|AR-1]] rocket engine could be tested there, with a goal of first flight of the new AR-1 engine after 2019.&lt;ref name=si20150619&gt;{{cite news|title=NASA signs SAA with Aerojet Rocketdyne to use Stennis test stand for AR1 engine|url=http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/space-centers/stennis-space-center/nasa-signs-saa-with-aerojet-rocketdyne-to-use-stennis-test-stand-for-ar1-engine/|accessdate=23 June 2015|work=Spaceflight Insider|date=2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Description =====
The stand is composed of three individual test "cells":{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}
:*E1 Cell 1 can handle liquid-propellant and hybrid based test articles up to {{convert|750000|lbf|kN}} of thrust in a horizontal position.
:*E1 Cells 2 and 3 are designed to support LOX and LH2 turbopump assemblies for testing with high-pressure propellant feeds.

==== E2 Test stand ====
The E2 test facility at Stennis is a multi-position cell that supports two separate test stands (Cell 1 and Cell 2), one for testing horizontally mounted engines and one for vertically mounted vehicle stages and/or engines.  Cell 1 can support engines with up to {{convert|100000|lbf|kN}} of thrust while Cell 2 can support vehicle stages with up to {{convert|324000|lbf|kN}} of thrust.&lt;ref name=sn20131025/&gt; 
The facility can provide Liquid Oxygen, Liquid Nitrogen, Liquid Hydrogen, Liquid Methane, Refined Petroleum (RP1), H2O, Gaseous Hydrogen, "Hot" Gaseous Hydrogen, Gaseous Oxygen and Gaseous Nitrogen.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;http://pdf.aiaa.org/downloads/2005/CDReadyMJPC2005_1177/2005_4419.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

E2 Cell 1, originally known as the High Heat Flux Facility (HHFF), was constructed in 1993 to support materials development for the [[National Aerospace Plane]] (NASP).&lt;ref name=sn20131025/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

The E2 test stand will be modified after 2013 to support [[liquid methane]] engine testing, with funds being provided by [[SpaceX]], the [[Mississippi Development Authority]] ({{US$|500,000}} using funding from state bond issues), and NASA (up to {{US$|600,000}}).  {{asof|2013|10}}, the SpaceX funding commitment to the methane modification project has not yet been disclosed, as the [[Space Act Agreement|contract]] has not yet been finalized and executed.  The methane modifications will become a permanent part of the Stennis test infrastructure and will be available to other users of the test facility after the SpaceX facility lease is completed.&lt;ref name=sn20131025&gt;

The most recent test completed on the E2 test stand, {{asof|2013|10|lc=y}}, was a 2012 NASA test of chemical [[steam generator]]s.&lt;ref name=sn20131025/&gt;

Beginning in 2014, [[SpaceX]] conducted tests of their liquid methane/liquid oxygen [[Raptor (rocket engine family)|Raptor]] rocket engine on the E2 test stand. Initial testing is limited to components of the Raptor engine, since the test stand is not large enough to test the full Raptor engine, which is rated to generate more than {{convert|661000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} vacuum thrust.&lt;ref name=13-311/&gt;&lt;ref name=sn20131025/&gt;&lt;ref name=nasa201509/&gt;

*E3 Cell 1 can support devices up to {{convert|60000|lbf}} thrust in a horizontal position. Propellant supports includes LOX or gaseous oxygen/hydrocarbon, gaseous oxygen/gaseous hydrogen and [[hybrid rocket|hybrid]].
*E3 Cell 2 can support devices up to {{convert|25000|lbf}} thrust in a vertical position. Propellent configurations are similar to E3 Cell 1 with the addition of [[hydrogen peroxide]] based devices.

A series of tests conducted in the late 1990s eventually led to the commercialization of [[hybrid rocket]] motors.

=== H-1 Test stand ===
In 2001 the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization proposed construction of a $140 million facility at Stennis H-1 test stand to test its proposed Space-Based Laser (SBL) to begin in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002. The facility was to be used to evaluate beam quality, efficiency, and power levels for a prototype megawatt-class hydrogen fluoride laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff2001/stennis.html |title=Stennis Space Center |publisher=Spinoff.nasa.gov |date=2011-05-01 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssc.nasa.gov/environmental/pdf/ER1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, British manufacturer [[Rolls-Royce plc]] has been operating an outdoor aero-engine test facility built on the old H1 test area. Rolls-Royce constructed the facility due to noise pollution concerns at its [[United Kingdom|UK]] testing facility at [[Hucknall Airfield]] near its headquarters in [[Derby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.einpresswire.com/article/56324314/rolls-royce-opens-new-outdoor-jet-engine-testing-facility |title=Rolls-Royce Opens New Outdoor Jet Engine Testing Facility |publisher=Einpresswire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of language as a 'system' appears in the linguistic theory of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[J.R. Firth]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], and [[Michael Halliday]].

The paradigmatic principle - the idea that the process of using language involves choosing from a specifiable set of options - was established in semiotics by Saussure, whose concept of value (viz. “valeur”), and of signs as terms in a system, “showed up paradigmatic organization as the most abstract dimension of meaning” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

=='System' in systemic functional linguistics==
“System” is used in two related ways in [[systemic functional linguistics]] (SFL). SFL uses the idea of system to refer to language as a whole, (e.g. “the system of language”). This usage derives from [[Louis Hjelmslev|Hjelmslev]] &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, [[Jay Lemke]] describes language as an open, dynamic system.

There is also the notion of “system” as used by [[John Rupert Firth|J.R. Firth]], where linguistic systems are considered to furnish the background for elements of structure.&lt;ref&gt;Firth, J.R. 1968. Selected Papers of J.R. Firth 1952-1959. London: Longman. p183.&lt;/ref&gt; Halliday argues that, unlike system in the sense in which it was used by Firth was a conception only found in Firth’s linguistic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Systemic Background. In "Systemic Perspectives on Discourse, Vol. 1: Selected Theoretical Papers" from the ''Ninth International Systemic Workshop'', James D. Benson and William S. Greaves (eds). Ablex. Reprinted in Full in Volume 3 in ''The Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum. p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this use of the term “system”, grammatical, or other features of language, are considered best understood when described as sets of options. Thus, “the most abstract categories of the grammatical description are the systems together with their options (systemic features). A systemic grammar differs from other functional grammars (and from all formal grammars) in that it is paradigmatic: a system is paradigmatic set of alternative features, of which one must be chosen if the entry condition is satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1992. Systemic Grammar and the Concept of a “Science of Language”. In Waiguoyu (Journal of Foreign Languages), No. 2 (General Series No. 78), pp1-9. Reprinted in Full in Volume 3 in ''The Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday''. London: Continuum. p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Halliday’s early work, “system” was considered to be one of four fundamental categories for the theory of grammar, the others being unit, structure and class. The category of ‘system’ was invoked to account for “the occurency of one rather than another from among a number of like events” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1961. Categories of the Theory of Grammar. Word. 17(3). pp241-92. Reprinted in Full in On Grammar: Volume 1 of the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. p 52&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Halliday defined grammar as “that level of linguistic form at which operate closed systems” &lt;ref&gt;Halliday, M.A.K. 1961. Categories of the Theory of Grammar. Word. 17(3). pp241-92. Reprinted in Full in On Grammar: Volume 1 of the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. p 40&lt;/ref&gt; 

In adopting a system perspective on language, systemic functional linguistics can be seen as part of a more general 20th and 21st century reaction against atomistic approaches to science, in which an essence is sought after within smaller and smaller components of the phenomenon under study. In systems thinking, any delineated object of study is defined by its relations to other units postulated by the theory. In systemic functional linguistics, this has been described as the trinocular perspective. Thus a descriptive category must be defended from three perspectives: from above (‘what does it construe?’ ‘what effect does it have in a context of use?’), below (‘how is this function realized?’) and round about (‘what else is in the neighbourhood?’ ‘what other things does this thing have to interact with?’). This gives systemic functional linguistics an affinity with studies of [[complex systems]].

'''Norman Haire''', born '''Norman Zions''' (21 January 1892, [[Sydney]] – 11 September 1952, [[London]]) was an Australian medical practitioner and [[sexologist]]. He has been called "the most prominent sexologist in Britain" between the wars.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography | last=Forster | first=Frank M. C. | year=1996 | id2=haire-norman-10390 | title=Haire, Norman (1892–1952) | accessdate= 3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
When Norman was born in 1892 his parents, Henry and Clara Zions, were living in Sydney at 255 Oxford Street, Paddington.  He was their unplanned and unwanted, 11th and final child.  He was a star debater at Fort Street High School but his plans to be an actor were thwarted when his parents made him study medicine.  He was anxious about his sexuality as a teenager (i.e., he was homosexual), but his chance discovery of [[Havelock Ellis]]' ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'' in Sydney's public library made him decide that he, like Ellis, would devote his life to saving people from sexual misery.  He graduated in 1915 from the [[University of Sydney]], and worked in several obstetric and mental health hospitals before his appointment as Medical Superintendent at [[Royal Newcastle Hospital|Newcastle Hospital]] at the time of the [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza pandemic]].  When a patient died, Zions was unjustly held responsible &lt;ref&gt;Diana Wyndham (2000) 'Misdiagnosis or miscarriage of justice? Dr Norman Haire and the 1919 influenza epidemic at Newcastle Hospital', ''Health and History'', July, 2 (1), pp. 3-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and, shortly after, left his homeland for twenty years.

After arriving in London he changed his name to Norman Haire in December 1919 and, five years later, his status as a poor, Jewish outsider had changed to that of a celebrity with a flourishing gynaecological practice in [[Harley Street]], a chauffeur-driven [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls Royce]] and a country house.  He was a feeling, thinking and doing man, equal parts hedonist and humanist; a tall, fat and flamboyant rationalist who was secretly homosexual and said blunt things in a beautiful voice. He sought out Havelock Ellis who introduced him to key people in the fields of eugenics and sexual reform, including birth control pioneers [[Margaret Sanger]], [[Marie Stopes]] and Charles and Bessie Drysdale from the [[Malthusian League]]. In 1921 Haire became the chief honorary medical officer at their free birth-control clinic - the Walworth Women's Welfare Centre in East London.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; In 1923, with a letter of introduction from Ellis, Haire travelled to Berlin to meet [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] (a Jewish, openly gay, socialist sexologist) and visited his [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexual Research).  In 1923 he became a fêted speaker at a [[Cambridge University]] prestigious society called The Heretics.  Five years later Haire captivated the audience at [[Oxford University]] when he became the St John's Essay Society's most illustrious speaker. They were dazzled by Haire whose three-hour and comprehensive exposition received 'intensive and appreciative attention' from an audience that was the largest in the Society's records.&lt;ref&gt;The History of the University of Oxford, The Twentieth Century, edited by Brian Harrison: Oxford: Clarendon. vol. 8 1994, 99&lt;/ref&gt;

People flocked to Haire's leactures and eagerly bought his informative books about birth control and sexology.  In 1922 he took a leading role in the world's first international conference on birth control which was held in London and he also starred in conferences in lecture tours in American and in Germany, France and Spain and he lectured fluently in German, French and Spanish.  He was one of the first to provide the poor with birth control clinics and he convinced Britain's medical profession of the need to learn about contraception and provide it.

Haire managed to combine his medical and theatrical talents and played a small part when
[[Ivor Montagu]] directed a cast of his friends in a 1928 silent slapstick movie called Blue Bottles (British slang for police) which used innovative special effects. The stars were [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Elsa Lanchester]] and it was adapted from a story by [[H G Wells]].
Haire was a superb administrator and with [[Dora Russell]] he organised the [[World League for Sexual Reform]]'s highly successful 1929 congress in London which many of the world's avant-garde attended.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Crozier, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3704509 "All the World's a Stage": Dora Russell, Norman Haire, and the 1929 London World League for Sexual Reform Congress], ''Journal for the History of Sexuality'' 12:1 (Jan. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1930 he was so famous that the society author [[Ethel Mannin]] commented 'The correct answer to 'Do you know who Norman Haire is? is 'Oh, good Lord, who doesn't'.&lt;ref&gt;Ethel Mannin. 'Confessions and Impressions. London: Hutchinson, 1930, p. 194)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as the Nazis rose to power in Germany [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] fled into exile and, after confiscating Marxist, communist, pacifist, Jewish and other 'un-German' books from libraries and private owners, [[Goebbels]] officiated at the 10 May 1933 [[Nazi book burnings]] in Berlin's Opera Place.  Stormtroopers and Nazi youths burnt about 20,000 books (including some written by Haire) from Hirschfeld's Institute for Sexual Research.

Satisfying people who yearned for longevity made Haire rich. The 'rejuvenation' craze
appealed mostly to men and it was really only a vasectomy (women had their ovaries irradiated) but, until the medical claims were refuted, hopeful patients paid high fees to revitalise their sex lives or defer senility. Having popularised the [[Eugen Steinach|Steinach]] rejuvenation operation throughout the 1920s, within nine years he had Steinached 'rather less than 200' artistic and intellectual men &lt;ref&gt;Norman Haire, 'The importance of sexual disorders and disharmonies in the production of ill-health', in the Third Sexual Reform Congress. Proceedings, London, 8–14 September 1929. London: Kegan Paul, 1930, p. 563.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[W. B. Yeats]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Wyndham, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jhbs.10091/abstract Versemaking and lovemaking—W. B. Yeats' "strange second puberty": Norman Haire and the Steinach rejuvenation operation], ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'', 39:1 (Winter 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s Haire's heart was weakened by [[rheumatic fever]]. In addition he became [[diabetic]] and was incapitated so severely that he was granted an invalid permit to leave Britain during the [[Second World War]].  He returned to Australia, expecting to die or be an invalid but once he began using insulin he was able to resume his medical work in Macquarie Street, Sydney.

In 1941 he began writing a weekly advice column under the pen name 'Dr Wykeham Terriss' for the Australian magazine ''Woman''. He continued to do so for a decade despite strong opposition by the Catholic Church.  The poet and journalist [[Elizabeth Riddell]], in an interview given during her 80s, spoke affectionately about her time on the editorial staff of ''Woman'' in the 1940s; she said that she and Haire were 'honest with each other and got along well'. Editor, columnist and ex-parliamentarian [[Peter Coleman]] called Haire 'one of Australia's most famous free thinkers and sex reformers' and said the column in ''Woman'' was 'probably the most free-thinking series of articles ever written for a mass circulation magazine'.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Coleman, ''Obscenity, Blasphemy, Sedition: Censorship in Australia''. Brisbane: Jacaranda Press, 1962, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=TisXUfr-K6eq4ATF6oDQBg&amp;hl=ru&amp;id=kV1ZAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Obscenity%2C+blasphemy%2C+seditionn%22&amp;q=most+free-thinking+series#search_anchor P. 82].&lt;/ref&gt; Haire was the key speaker in an [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] radio debate 'Population Unlimited?' in 1944 but was hounded by the security service which suspected him of being 'a secret communist'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/hindsight/stories/2010/2769314.htm Sex and Sin: How Sexologist Norman Haire Shocked Australia], [[ABC Radio National]] - Hindsight&lt;/ref&gt; Following this debate, politicians denounced him in parliament and behind the scenes their sabotage attempts segued into a dramatic court case on 22 March 1945. ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported on 4 April that Haire had been charged with assaulting a patient with her 'red handbag.'  Haire gave a list of his opponents to his lawyers but, amazingly, he did not believe the woman's charges were part of a 'premeditated plot' but said that, once his enemies and [[Ezra Norton]]'s scandal sheet ''[[Truth (Sydney newspaper)|Truth]]'' found out, 'they decided to exploit it, and encouraged her to make the most of it'. Four days before he was charged, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' noted on 25 April that Haire had withdrawn from rehearsals for his much-acclaimed role as Sir Ralph Bonnington-Bloomfield at the [[Independent Theatre]].  ''Woman'' remained supportive and he continued with the articles. He even wrote about abortion and said he had received 1000 abortion requests from Australian women between 1940 and 1946. When some of the readers accused him of being an abortionist, he wrote on 6 August 1945 that he had 'learned to ignore such scurrilous abuse' although he worried others might be bored by his frequent warnings. This was a brave stance when Australian newspapers refused to print the word 'abortion' and substituted euphemisms such 'an illegal operation' or 'bringing on the periods.'

He returned to London in 1946 and during most of his final years in Britain he bravely persevered in his quest to fine tune sexual morality so that individuals and communities could live as harmoniously as possible.  The [[World League for Sexual Reform]] was disbanded in 1935 so after the [[Second World War]] he established and became president of the Sexual Reform Society and published ''The Journal of Sex Education'' to rekindle the campaign for sexual reform.  History professor Nicholas Edsall wrote: 'More than anyone else it was [Haire] who had kept the issue of [homo-]sexual reform alive, though only barely, through the lean years of the 1930s and the post-war years in Britain.  There were no organisations in Britain comparable to the [[Mattachine Society]] in the United States, [[Arcadie]] in France, or even the [[International Society for Human Rights]] in Germany, let alone the Dutch COC' – the [[Dutch Society for Sexual Reform]]. 'The last, tenuous link with the [[British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology]] 'was broken when 'its post-war successor, the Sex Education Society, died
following the death of Norman Haire' &lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Edsall (2003) 'Toward [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]]: Homosexuality and society in the modern western world'. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, on a lecture tour of the [[United States]], he suffered a heart attack and was forced to return to London where he died at the age of 60.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;  On 31 October 1952 [[The Times]] advertised the sale of Haire's house at 127 Harley Street and published this Wills and Bequest Notice on 10 December: 'Dr Norman Haire of Harley Street, W and Sydney, Australia, left an estate in England valued at £31,365 (duty paid £2886). He left a bequest to his lifelong companion Willem Van de Haght (the former administrator of the Rotterdam Zoo) and left the library of books and other publications to the University of Sydney, and, after other legacies and bequests, the residue of his property to the university directing that it be paid to the Vice-Chancellor to be applied in such manner as the Senate of the university determines for the study of sexology.'   Haire's executors (his solicitor Philip Kimber and Lloyds Bank Ltd) felt it was in the public interest to ignore his will and destroy his papers. They decided that since he was a sexologist and there was correspondence from a number of distinguished persons which might have caused embarrassment if it fell into the wrong hands, they would burn everything and did so.&lt;ref&gt;John Kelly, quoting Kimber, letter to Diana Wyndham 10 July 2001&lt;/ref&gt; They also burnt the Sex Education Society's records. Fortunately, much of the information has survived because he was a famous lecturer and author who mixed with famous and influential people, many of whom recorded their impressions of him.  The contribution this tenacious, humane, innovative and brave man made to birth control, sexology and human rights history are celebrated in his biography &lt;ref&gt;Diana Wyndham. {{cite web|url= http://purl.library.usyd.edu.au/sup/9781743320068|title='Norman Haire and the Study of Sex'}} Foreword by the Hon. [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] AC CMG. (Sydney: {{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/sup/|title=Sydney University Press}}, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Haire told 'Paddy' O'Connor that he had decided to leave his money to the University of Sydney for the study of sex 'to annoy the wowsers' &lt;ref&gt;Haire's comment to his friend was quoted by [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R F Foster]] in ''WB Yeats: A life. II: The Arch-poet 1915–1939'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), 2003, p 497, fn 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haire's papers are held at the [[University of Sydney]] Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/HaireEAD.html Guide to the Norman Haire Collection, bulk 1926 - 1950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322092534/http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/HaireEAD.html |date=2012-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''OER4Schools''' programme is a teacher professional development programme utilizing [[information and communication technologies]] (ICT), focussing on [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The OER4Schools Professional Learning Resource|url=http://oer.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/OER4Schools|work=University of Cambridge: Faculty of Education|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initiated at the Centre for Commonwealth Education,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/centres/archive/cce/&lt;/ref&gt; based at the [[Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge]]. Aspects of the OER4Schools project are developed in conjunction with [[OER Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Teacher Education OER Network|url=http://www.oerafrica.org/african-teacher-education-oer-network-aten/about-african-teacher-education-network|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phase 1 (Pilot)==

The OER4Schools programme started in August 2009 with a pilot phase, that was completed in May 2010. Through this pilot, the programme assessed the feasibility of providing [[Open Educational Resources]] (OER) to ICT- and Internet-equipped primary schools in [[Zambia]], and of supporting interactive forms of subject pedagogy with the new resources. It identified the needs of school-based professional development adapted to the local context. The programme is conducted in a North-South partnership between the CCE and institutions in Zambia. It combines stakeholders from various sectors (including educational research, ICT for development [NGOs], government, and the ICT service sector) as a basis for developing methodologies that promise lasting transformation in Zambian primary education. While the project is conducted in Zambia, it is anticipated to be relevant to a wide range of countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Key outputs include models for OER-Pedagogy-ICT adoption in poorly resourced educational systems, and guidance on implementing better learning environments.

In the pilot phase the primary aim of the project was to conduct the necessary research to build a further proposal for external funding over a longer period. We worked with teachers in 3 schools, developing, supporting and trialling uses of OERs combined with new pedagogical approaches for teaching mathematics. There were opportunities for peer observation and reflective practice. The research element recorded classroom practice and assessed participants' reactions and learning, eliciting messages for embedding basic ICT and OER use in teacher education. Findings were presented at the [[eLearning Africa]] Conference in Lusaka in May 2010.

== Phase 2 (2010-2012) ==

The second phase started in June 2010, and draws on outcomes of the pilot phase. We developed a professional learning resource for teachers and student teachers, focussing on interactive teaching and learning - with and without ICT. A key element of this resource is the use of unique video clips illustrating interactive practice (produced in Zambian and South African primary classroom contexts) as a stimulus for discussion.

The resource is freely available for re-use under a [[Creative Commons license]].{{which|date=February 2014}} It supports different modes of learning, including collaborative and individual use, as well as blended learning as part of a course. It will be available in a number of formats, appropriate to the varied African environments in which teachers find themselves. It is being embedded in various teacher education and professional development courses administered by teacher colleges and universities in Zambia and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa; "taster workshops" have been run successfully with lecturers and students in three higher education settings.

The second phase culminated in trialling the resource with all teachers in Grade 4 to 6 at Chalimbana Basic School throughout 2012. A Zambian teacher facilitated regular workshops with his colleagues.

== Phase 3 (2013-2014) ==

In the third phase (2013), the programme has now broadened to all grades at the school, involving all 35 teachers and all pupils (around 1,000). Workshops are again being facilitated by teachers who participated in earlier phases, leading colleagues (Grades 1-9) through regular teacher group meetings using the resource. Research questions included: What forms of stimulus and support are most effective in developing more interactive pedagogy? What changes took place? What were the supporting and constraining factors? Research methods included audio diaries, lesson and workshop observations, video recording and teacher interviews.

== The OER4Schools professional learning resource ==

The OER4Schools programme developed a professional learning resource that can be used in [[pre-service teacher education|pre-service]] or [[inservice program|in-service]] teacher education by groups of teachers working together and ultimately sharing practices with others. The resource supports interactive teaching and active, collaborative learning – generally, and through using mobile technologies (tablets, netbooks, e-book readers etc.), digital open educational resources (OER) and Open Source software – as appropriate for teachers’ own purposes and settings.

The professional learning programme is suitable for low-resourced primary schools and teacher colleges (combined with teaching practice), and freely available as an OER. It consists of 25 two-hour sessions, organised in five units, covering interactive teaching principles, group work, questioning, dialogue, Assessment for Learning, and enquiry-based learning. Each session includes unique, professionally filmed video exemplars of interactive practices in Zambian and South African classrooms (with and without technology), accompanying texts, practical activities and facilitator notes. It is based on an established process for teacher-led discussion, trialling new ideas, peer observation and joint reflection, all stimulated and guided by the professional development materials. The overall goal is to focus on learning, meeting the challenge of moving away from superficial repetition of facts towards [[w:Deeper_Learning|deeper learning]] and understanding. The materials have been participatively developed in conjunction with local stakeholders, including teachers, teacher college lecturers and other partners.

The resources are hosted using [[MediaWiki]] and are also available as ZIM files (using [[Kiwix]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13400">{{About|the concept of objectivity as it is used in science||Objectivity (disambiguation)}}
'''Objectivity''' in science is an attempt to uncover truths about the natural world by eliminating personal [[bias]]es, emotions, and false beliefs.&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity"&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.zonebooks.org/titles/DAST_OBJ.html|title=Objectivity|publisher=Zone Books|author1=Daston, Lorraine|author2=Galison, Peter|year=2010|isbn=9781890951795}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often linked to [[Observation#Observation_in_science|observation]] as part of the [[scientific method]]. It is thus intimately related to the aim of [[testability]] and [[reproducibility]]. To be considered objective, the results of measurement must be communicated from person to person, and then {{em|demonstrated}} for third parties, as an advance in a [[consensus reality|collective understanding]] of the world. Such demonstrable knowledge has ordinarily conferred demonstrable powers of prediction or technology.

The problem of [[Objectivity (philosophy)|philosophical objectivity]] is contrasted with personal [[subjectivity]], sometimes exacerbated by the [[scientific consensus|overgeneralization]] of a hypothesis to the whole. ''E.g.'' [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] appears to be the norm for the attraction between [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]], but it was later superseded by the more general [[theory of relativity]].

==History==
The [[scientific method]] was argued for by [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosopher [[Francis Bacon]], rose to popularity with the discoveries of [[Isaac Newton]] and his followers, and continued into later eras. In the early eighteenth century, there existed an [[Epistemology|epistemic]] virtue in science which has been called ''truth-to-nature''.&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|55–58}} This ideal was practiced by Enlightenment [[Natural history|naturalists]] and scientific atlas-makers, and involved active attempts to eliminate any idiosyncrasies in their representations of nature in order to create images thought best to represent "what truly is."&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|59–60}}&lt;ref name="Representations"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nyu.edu/classes/bkg/methods/daston.pdf | title=The Image of Objectivity |author1=Daston, Lorraine |author2=Galison, Peter | journal=Representations |date=Autumn 1992  | volume=0 | issue=40 | pages=81–128 | doi=10.2307/2928741}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84–85}} Judgment and skill were deemed necessary in order to determine the "typical", "characteristic", "ideal", or "average."&lt;ref name="Representations" /&gt;{{rp|87}} In practicing truth-to-nature naturalists did not seek to depict exactly what was seen; rather, they sought a reasoned image.&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|98}}

In the latter half of the nineteenth century objectivity in science was born when a new practice of ''mechanical objectivity'' appeared.&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|121}} {{"'}}Let nature speak for itself' became the watchword of a new brand of scientific objectivity."&lt;ref name="Representations" /&gt;{{rp|81}} It was at this time that idealized representations of nature, which were previously seen as a virtue, were now seen as a vice.&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|120}} Scientists began to see it as their duty to actively restrain themselves from imposing their own projections onto nature.&lt;ref name="Representations" /&gt;{{rp|81}} The aim was to liberate representations of nature from subjective, human interference and in order to achieve this [[scientists]] began using self-registering instruments, cameras, wax molds, and other technological devices.&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|121}}

In the twentieth century ''trained judgment''&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|309}} supplemented mechanical objectivity as scientists began to recognize that, in order for images or data to be of any use, scientists needed to be able to see scientifically; that is, to interpret images or data and identify and group them according to particular professional training, rather than to simply depict them mechanically.&lt;ref name="Daston Galison Objectivity" /&gt;{{rp|311–314}} Since the latter half of the nineteenth century, objectivity has come to involve a combination of trained judgment and mechanical objectivity.

==Objectivity in measurement==
Another methodological aspect is the avoidance of bias, which can involve [[cognitive bias]], [[cultural bias]], or [[sampling bias]]. Methods for avoiding or overcoming such biases include [[random sampling]] and [[double-blind]] trials.&lt;ref name="O'Leary2004"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?hl=pl&amp;lr=&amp;id=ItKeqNfgNW0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=objectivity+in+sampling,+random+sampling&amp;ots=pLasfy8tgH&amp;sig=kenaqNz6_pIH98Ddmug1gNQQrfM&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=objectivity%20in%20sampling,%20random%20sampling&amp;f=false|title=The Essential Guide to Doing Research|last=O'Leary|first=Zina|date=2004-06-09|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9780761941996|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, objectivity in measurement can be unobtainable in certain circumstances. Even the most quantitative social sciences such as [[economics]] employ measures that are constructs (conventions, to employ the term coined by [[Pierre Duhem]]). For instance, one can use different weighting schemes when calculating [[inflation]] rates. Applying different conventions (such as the [[Paasche and Laspayres Indices]]) leads to obtaining diverging results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maziarz|first=Mariusz|date=2018|title=Objectivity - a Pipe Dream?|url=http://www.ethicsinfinance.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Mariusz-Maziarz-Do-the-right-thing-incentivise-ethics.pdf|journal=Finance &amp; the common good|volume=44-45|pages=64-78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of the scientific community==
{{main|Scientific misconduct}}

{{attribution needed|text=Various scientific processes, such as [[peer review]]s, the discussions at [[scientific conference]]s, and other meetings where scientific results are presented, are part of a social process whose purpose is to strengthen the objective aspect of the scientific method.|date=January 2010|reason=This seems like original research or an opinion. Attribution is needed.}}

Next to unintentional and systematic error, there is always the possibility of deliberate misrepresentation of scientific results, whether for gain, fame, or ideological motives. {{according to whom|When such cases of scientific fraud come to light, they usually give rise to an [[academic scandal]], but it is unknown how much fraud goes undiscovered. For important results, other groups will try to repeat the experiment. If they consistently fail, they will bring these negative results into the scientific debate.|date=January 2010}}

==Critiques of scientific objectivity==
A critical argument on scientific objectivity and [[positivism]] is that all science has a degree of [[Antipositivism|interpretivism]].&lt;ref name="History of Psychiatry"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology: With an Epilogue on Psychiatry and the Mind-Body Relation | publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |author1=Gach, John |author2=Wallace, Edwin R. | year=2010 | isbn=9780387347080}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} In the 1920s, Percy Bridgman's ''[[The Logic of Modern Physics]]'' and the [[operationalism]] presented was centered in such recognition.&lt;ref name="History of Psychiatry" /&gt;{{rp|29}}

===Thomas Kuhn's ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''===
Based on a historical review of the development of certain scientific theories in his book, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', scientist and historian [[Thomas Kuhn]] raised some philosophical objections to claims of the possibility of scientific understanding being truly objective. In Kuhn's analysis, scientists in different disciplines organise themselves into {{lang|la|de facto}} [[paradigm]]s within which scientific research is done, junior scientists are educated, and scientific problems are determined.&lt;ref name="Kuhn"&gt;{{Citation|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|year=1962|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|url=http://projektintegracija.pravo.hr/_download/repository/Kuhn_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When observational data arises which appears to contradict or [[Falsifiability|falsify]] a given [[scientific paradigm]], scientists within that paradigm historically have not immediately rejected it, as [[Karl Popper]]'s philosophical theory of falsificationism would have them do. Instead they have gone to considerable lengths to resolve the apparent conflict without rejecting the paradigm. Through [[ad hoc]] variations to the theory and sympathetic interpretation of the data, supporting scientists will resolve the apparent conundrum. In extreme cases, they may ignore the data altogether. Thus, the failure of a scientific paradigm will go into crisis when a significant portion of scientists working in the field lose confidence in it. The corollary of this observation is that a paradigm is contingent on the social order amongst scientists at the time it gains ascendancy.&lt;ref name="Kuhn" /&gt;

{{citation needed span|text=Kuhn's theory has been criticised by scientists such as [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Alan Sokal]] as presenting a [[Relativism|relativist]] view of scientific progress.|date=January 2010}} {{citation needed span|text=In a postscript to the third edition of his book, Kuhn denied being a relativist.|date=January 2010}}

===Donna Haraway's ''Situated Knowledges''===
{{further|Knowledge#Situated knowledge}}
In ''Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective'' (1988), [[Donna Haraway]] argues that objectivity in science and philosophy is traditionally understood as a kind of disembodied and transcendent "conquering gaze from nowhere."&lt;ref name="Situated Knowledges"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Haraway,%20Situated%20Knowledges.pdf|title=Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective|author=Haraway, Donna|journal=Feminist Studies|date=Autumn 1988|volume=14|issue=3|pages=575–599|doi=10.2307/3178066|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|581}} She argues that this kind of objectivity, in which the subject is split apart and distanced from the object, is an impossible "illusion, a god trick."&lt;ref name="Situated Knowledges"/&gt;{{rp|583–587}} She demands a re-thinking of objectivity in such a way that, while still striving for "faithful accounts of the real world,"&lt;ref name="Situated Knowledges" /&gt;{{rp|579}} we must also acknowledge our perspective within the world. She calls this new kind of knowledge-making "situated knowledges." Objectivity, she argues, "turns out to be about particular and specific embodiment and ... not about the false vision promising transcendence of all limits and responsibility". This new objectivity, "allows us to become answerable for what we learn how to see."&lt;ref name="Situated Knowledges"/&gt;{{rp|581–583}} Thus, Haraway is not only critiquing the idea that objectivity as we have long understood it is possible; she is also arguing that if we continue to approach knowledge-making in this way, then we wash our hands of any responsibility for our truth claims. In contrast, she argues, approaching knowledge-making from an embodied perspective forces us to take responsibility.

{{broader|energy modeling}}

'''Open energy system models''' are [[energy system]] [[Energy modeling|models]] that are [[open source software|open source]].{{efn|
The terminology is not settled.  These models can also be known as '''open energy models''' or '''open source energy system models''' or some combination thereof.
}}  Similarly open energy system data employs [[open data]] methods to produce and distribute [[dataset]]s primarily for use by open energy system models.

Energy system models are used to explore future energy systems and are often applied to questions involving [[energy policy|energy]] and [[Politics of global warming|climate policy]].  The models themselves vary widely in terms of their type, design, programming, application, scope, level of detail, sophistication, and shortcomings.&lt;ref name="pye-and-bataille-2016"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|238}}  For many models, some form of [[mathematical optimization]] is used to inform the solution process.

Several drivers favor the development of open models and open data.  There is an increasing interest in making [[public policy]] energy models more transparent to improve their acceptance by policymakers and the public.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a desire to leverage the benefits that open data and [[open-source software development|open software development]] can bring, including reduced duplication of effort, better sharing of ideas and information, improved quality, and wider engagement and adoption.&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"/&gt;  Model development is therefore usually a [[collaborative software development model|team effort]] and constituted as either an academic project, a commercial venture, or a genuinely inclusive community initiative.

This article does not cover projects which simply make their [[source code]] or [[spreadsheet]]s available for public download, but which omit a recognized [[free software license|free and open-source software license]].

== General considerations ==

{{see also|Energy modeling|Open-source software development}}

=== Organization ===

An open energy system modeling project typically comprises a [[codebase]], [[dataset]]s, and [[software documentation]] and perhaps [[Scientific literature|scientific publications]].&lt;ref name="bazilian-etal-2012"&gt;

 | access-date = 2016-06-17
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The project repository may be hosted on an institutional server or on a public [[Comparison of open source software hosting facilities|code-hosting site]], such as [[GitHub]].  Some projects release only their [[codebase]], while others ship some or all of their [[dataset]]s as well.  Projects may also offer [[Electronic mailing list|email lists]], [[Online chat|chat rooms]], and [[Internet forum|web forums]] to aid collaboration.

The majority of projects are based within university research groups, either singingly or as academic collaborations.

A 2017 paper lists the benefits of open data and models and discusses the reasons that many projects nonetheless remain closed.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|211–213}}  The paper makes a number of recommendations for projects wishing to transition to a more open approach.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|214}}  The authors also conclude that, in terms of openness, energy research has lagged behind other fields, most notably physics, biotechnology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|213–214}}

=== Growth ===

Open energy system modeling came of age in the 2010s.  Just two projects were cited in a 2011 paper on the topic: [[#OSeMOSYS|OSeMOSYS]] and [[#TEMOA|TEMOA]].&lt;ref name="howells-etal-2011"/&gt;{{rp|5861}}  [[#Balmorel|Balmorel]] was also active at that time, having been made public in 2001.{{efn|
[[#NEMO|NEMO]] was also under development in 2011 but it is unclear whether its codebase was public at that point.
}}  {{as of|2017|03}}, this article lists 25 such undertakings (with a further six waiting to be [[Talk:Open energy system models#Further models|added]]).

=== Transparency, comprehensibility, and reproducibility ===

{{see also|Open Energy Modelling Initiative#Context}}

The use of open energy system models and open energy data represents one attempt to improve the transparency, comprehensibility, and reproducibility of energy system models, particularly those used to aid public policy development.&lt;ref name="acatech-etal-2016"/&gt;

A 2010 paper concerning energy efficiency modeling argues that "an open peer review process can greatly support model verification and validation, which are essential for model development".&lt;ref name="mundaca-etal-2010a"&gt;&lt;!--

&lt;/ref&gt;  To further honor the process of [[peer review]], researchers argue, in a 2012 paper, that it is essential to place both the [[source code]] and [[dataset]]s under publicly accessible [[version control]] so that third-parties can run, verify, and scrutinize specific models.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"/&gt;  A 2016 paper contends that model-based energy scenario studies, seeking to influence decision-makers in government and industry, must become more comprehensible and more transparent.  To these ends, the paper provides a [[checklist]] of transparency criteria that should be completed by modelers.  The authors however state that they "consider open source approaches to be an extreme case of transparency that does not automatically facilitate the comprehensibility of studies for policy advice."&lt;ref name="cao-etal-2016"&gt;

A one-page opinion piece from 2017 advances the case for using open energy data and modeling to build public trust in policy analysis.  The article also argues that [[academic journal|scientific journals]] have a responsibility to require that data and code be submitted alongside text for [[peer review]].&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"&gt;&lt;!-- alternative url: http://www.nature.com/news/energy-scientists-must-show-their-workings-1.21517 --&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State projects ===

State-sponsored open source projects in any domain are a relatively new phenomena.

{{as of|2017}}, the [[European Commission]] now supports several open source energy system modeling projects to aid the transition to a low-carbon energy system for Europe.  The Dispa-SET project ([[#Dispa-SET|below]]) is modeling the European electricity system and hosts its codebase on [[GitHub]].  The MEDEAS project, which will design and implement a new open source energy-economy model for Europe, held its kick-off meeting in February 2016.&lt;ref name="set-plan-2016-one"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  {{as of|2017|02}}, the project had yet to publish any source code.  The established OSeMOSYS project ([[#OSeMOSYS|below]]) is developing a multi-sector energy model for Europe with Commission funding to support stakeholder outreach.&lt;ref name="howells-2016"&gt;

The United States [[National Energy Modeling System|NEMS]] national model is available but nonetheless difficult to use.  NEMS does not classify as an open source project in the accepted sense.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2017"/&gt;

== Open electricity sector models ==

Open electricity sector models are confined to just the electricity sector.  These models invariably have a temporal resolution of one hour or less.  Some models concentrate on the engineering characteristics of the system, including a good representation of [[Electric power transmission|high-voltage transmission networks]] and [[Power-flow study|AC power flow]].  Others models depict electricity [[spot market]]s and are known as dispatch models.  While other models embed [[Agent-based model|autonomous agents]] to capture, for instance, [[Auction|bidding decisions]] using techniques from [[bounded rationality]].  The ability to handle [[variable renewable energy]], transmission systems, and [[Grid energy storage|grid storage]] are becoming important considerations.

DIETER stands for Dispatch and Investment Evaluation Tool with Endogenous Renewables.  DIETER is a dispatch and investment model. It was first used to study the role of [[Grid energy storage|power storage]] and other flexibility options in a future [[Greenfield project|greenfield]] setting with high shares of renewable generation.  DIETER is being developed at the [[German Institute for Economic Research]] (DIW), [[Berlin]], Germany.  The [[codebase]] and [[Data (computing)|datasets]] for Germany can be downloaded from the project website.  The basic model is fully described in a DIW working paper and a journal article.&lt;ref name="zerrahn-and-schill-2015"&gt;

DIETER is framed as a pure [[Linear programming|linear]] (no integer variables) cost minimization problem.

The first study using DIETER examines the power storage requirements for renewables uptake ranging from 60% to 100%.  Under the baseline scenario of 80% (the lower bound German government target for 2050), [[Grid energy storage|grid storage]] requirements remain moderate and other options on both the supply side and demand side offer flexibility at low cost.  Nonetheless storage plays an important role in the provision of reserves.  Storage becomes more pronounced under higher shares of renewables, but strongly depends on the costs and availability of other flexibility options, particularly biomass availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schill|first=Wolf-Peter|last2=Zerrahn|first2=Alexander|title=Long-run power storage requirements for high shares of renewables: Results and sensitivities|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.205|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.205|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model power system is managed by a single operator with full knowledge of the economic and technical characteristics of the generation units, the loads at each node, and the heavily simplified transmission network.  Demand is deemed fully [[Elasticity (economics)|inelastic]].  The system is subject to intra-period and inter-period [[Unit commitment problem in electrical power production|unit commitment]] constraints (the latter covering nuclear and thermal generation for the most part) and operated under [[economic dispatch]].&lt;ref name="quoilin-etal-2017"/&gt;{{rp|4}}  Hourly data is used and the simulation horizon is normally one year.  But to ensure the model remains tractable, two day rolling horizon optimization is employed.

EMLab-Generation simulates the actions of [[Electric power industry|power companies]] investing in generation capacity and uses this to explore the long-term effects of various [[Energy policy|energy]] and [[Climate change mitigation|climate protection]] policies.  These policies may target renewable generation, {{CO2}} emissions, security of supply, and/or energy affordability.  The power companies are the main agents: they bid into power markets and they invest based on the [[net present value]] (NPV) of prospective power plant projects.  They can adopt a variety of technologies, using scenarios from the 2011 [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] [[World Energy Outlook]].&lt;ref name="iea-2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The agent-based methodology enables different sets of assumptions to be tested, such as the heterogeneity of actors, the consequences of imperfect expectations, and the behavior of investors outside of ideal conditions.

EMLab-Generation offers a new way of modeling the effects of public policy on electricity markets.  It can provide insights into actor and system behaviors over time – including such things as investment cycles, abatement cycles, delayed responses, and the effects of uncertainty and risk on investment decisions.

A 2014 study using EMLab-Generation investigates the effects of introducing floor and ceiling prices for {{CO2}} under the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|EU ETS]].  And in particular, their influence on the dynamic investment pathway of two interlinked electricity markets (loosely Great Britain and Central Western Europe).  The study finds a common, moderate {{CO2}} auction reserve price results in a more continuous decarbonisation pathway and reduces {{CO2}} price volatility.  Adding a ceiling price can shield consumers from extreme price shocks.  Such price restrictions should not lead to an overshoot of emissions targets in the long-run.&lt;ref name="richstein-etal-2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  EMMA is written in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]] and uses the [[CPLEX]] commercial solver.

EMMA models electricity dispatch and investment, minimizing the total cost with respect to investment, generation, and trades between market areas.  In economic terms, EMMA classifies as a [[partial equilibrium]] model of the wholesale [[electricity market]] with a focus on the supply-side.  EMMA identifies short-term or long-term optima (or equilibria) and estimates the corresponding capacity mix, hourly prices, dispatch, and cross-border trading.  Technically, EMMA is a pure [[Linear programming|linear program]] (no integer variables) with about two million {{nowrap|non-zero}} variables.  {{as of|2016}}, the model covers Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Poland and supports conventional generation, renewable generation, and [[cogeneration]].&lt;ref name="hirth-2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hirth-2014"&gt;

EMMA has been used to study the economic effects of the increasing penetration of [[variable renewable energy]] (VRE), specifically solar power and wind power, in the Northwestern European power system.  A 2013 study finds that increasing VRE shares will depress prices and, as a consequence, the competitive large-scale deployment of renewable generation will be more difficult to accomplish than many anticipate.&lt;ref name="hirth-2013"&gt;

The GENESYS simulation tool is designed to optimize a future EUMENA (Europe, Middle East, and North Africa) power system and assumes a high share of renewable generation.  It is able to find an economically optimal distribution of generator, storage, and transmission capacities within a 21{{nbsp}}region EUMENA.  It allows for the optimization of this energy system in combination with an evolutionary method.  The optimization is based on a [[CMA-ES|covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy]] (CMA-ES), while the operation is simulated as a hierarchical set-up of system elements which balance the load between the various regions at minimum cost using the [[network simplex algorithm]].  GENESYS ships with a set of input time series and a set of parameters for the year 2050, which the user can modify.

A future EUMENA energy supply system with a high share of renewable energy sources (RES) will need a strongly interconnected energy transport grid and significant energy storage capacities.  GENESYS was used to dimension the storage and transmission between the 21{{nbsp}}different regions.  Under the assumption of 100% self-supply, about {{val|2500|u=GW}} of RES in total and a storage capacity of about {{val|240000|u=GWh}} are needed, corresponding to 6% of the annual energy demand, and a HVDC transmission grid of {{val|375000|u=GW·km}}.  The combined cost estimate for generation, storage, and transmission, excluding distribution, is 6.87{{nbsp}}¢/kWh.&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2014"&gt;

A 2016 study looked at the relationship between storage and transmission capacity under high shares of renewable energy sources (RES) in an EUMENA power system.  It found that, up to a certain extent, transmission capacity and storage capacity can substitute for each other.  For a transition to a fully renewable energy system by 2050, major structural changes are required.  The results indicate the optimal allocation of photovoltaics and wind power, the resulting demand for storage capacities of different technologies (battery, pumped hydro, and hydrogen storage) and the capacity of the transmission grid.&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2016"&gt;

NEMO, the National Electricity Market Optimiser, is a chronological dispatch model for testing and optimizing different portfolios of conventional and renewable electricity generation technologies.  It applies solely to the Australian [[National Electricity Market]] (NEM), which, despite its name, is limited to east and south Australia.  NEMO has been in development at the [http://www.ceem.unsw.edu.au/ Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets] (CEEM), [[University of New South Wales]] (UNSW), [[Sydney]], Australia since 2011.&lt;ref name="nemo-website"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The project maintains a small website and runs an [[Electronic mailing list|email list]].  NEMO is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  NEMO itself is described in two publications.&lt;ref name="elliston-etal-2012"/&gt;{{rp|sec{{nnbsp}}2}}&lt;ref name="elliston-etal-2016"/&gt;{{rp|sec{{nnbsp}}2}}  The data sources are also noted.&lt;ref name="elliston-etal-2012"/&gt;{{rp|sec{{nnbsp}}3}}  Optimizations are carried out using a single-objective evaluation function, with penalties.  The solution space of generator capacities is searched using the [[CMA-ES]] (covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy) algorithm.  The timestep is arbitrary but one hour is normally employed.

NEMO has been used to explore generation options for the year 2030 under a variety of renewable energy (RE) and abated fossil fuel technology scenarios.  A 2012 study investigates the feasibility of a fully renewable system using [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP) with thermal storage, [[Wind power|windfarms]], [[photovoltaics]], existing [[hydroelectricity]], and [[biofuel]]led [[gas turbine]]s.  A number of potential systems, which also meet NEM reliability criteria, are identified.  The principal challenge is servicing peak demand on winter evenings following overcast days and periods of low wind.&lt;ref name="elliston-etal-2012"&gt;

OnSSET is the OpeN Source Spatial Electrification Toolkit.  OnSSET is being developed by the [https://www.kth.se/en/itm/inst/energiteknik/forskning/desa Energy Systems Analysis Group] (dESA), [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]], [[Stockholm]], Sweden.  The software is used to examine areas not served by grid-based electricity and identify the technology options and investment requirements that will provide least-cost access to electricity services.  OnSSET is designed to support the [[United Nations]]' [[Sustainable Development Goals|SDG{{nnbsp}}7]]: the provision of affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.  The [[Python (programming language)|Python]] implementation of the toolkit is known as PyOnSSET and was released on 26{{nbsp}}November 2016.  PyOnSSET does not ship with data, but suitable datasets are available from [[Open energy system databases#energydata.info|energydata.info]].  The project maintains a website and hosts a forum on [[Reddit]].&lt;ref name="onsset-website"&gt;

pandapower is a power system analysis and optimization program being jointly developed by the Energy Management and Power System Operation research group, [[University of Kassel]] and the Department for Distribution System Operation, [[Fraunhofer Institute]] for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology (IEE), both of [[Kassel]], Germany.  The codebase is hosted on [[GitHub]] and is also available as a [[Python Package Index|package]].  The project maintains a website, an [[Electronic mailing list|emailing list]], and online documentation.  pandapower is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  It uses the [[pandas (software)|pandas]] library for data manipulation and analysis and the PYPOWER library{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref name="pypower-website"&gt;
{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; to solve for [[Power-flow study|power flow]].  Unlike some open source power system tools, pandapower does not depend on proprietary platforms like [[MATLAB]].

pandapower supports the automated analysis and optimization of [[Electric power distribution|distribution]] and transmission networks.  This allows a large of number of scenarios to be explored, based on different future grid configurations and technologies.  pandapower offers a collection of power system elements, including: lines, 2-winding transformers, 3-winding transformers, and ward-equivalents.  It also contains a switch model that allows the modeling of ideal bus-bus switches as well as bus-line/bus-trafo switches.  The software supports topological searching.  The network itself can be plotted, with or without geographical information, using the [[matplotlib]] and [[plotly]] libraries.

A 2016 publication evaluates the usefulness of the software by undertaking several case studies with major distribution system operators (DSO).  These studies examine the integration of increasing levels of [[photovoltaics]] into existing distribution grids.  The study concludes that being able to test a large number of detailed scenarios is essential for robust grid planning.  Notwithstanding, issues of data availability and problem dimensionality will continue to present challenges.&lt;ref name="scheidler-etal-2016"&gt;

A 2018 paper describes the package and its design and provides an example case study.  The article explains how users work with an element-based model (EBM) which is converted internally to a bus-branch model (BBM) for computation.  The package supports power system simulation, optimal power flow calculations (cost information is required), state estimation (should the system characterization lacks fidelity), and [[graph theory|graph]]-based network analysis.  The case study shows how a few tens of lines of scripting can interface with pandapower to advance the design of a system subject to diverse operating requirements.  The associated code is hosted on GitHub as [[Project Jupyter|jupyter notebooks]].&lt;ref name="thurner-etal-2018"&gt;

The PowerMatcher software implements a [[smart grid]] coordination mechanism which balances [[Distributed generation|distributed energy resources]] (DER) and flexible loads through autonomous [[bidding]].  The project is managed by the Flexiblepower Alliance Network (FAN) in [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands.  The project maintains a website and the [[source code]] is hosted on [[GitHub]].  {{as of|2016|06}}, existing datasets are not available.  PowerMatcher is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

Each device in the smart grid system – whether a washing machine, a wind generator, or an industrial turbine – expresses its willingness to consume or produce electricity in the form of a bid.  These bids are then collected and used to determine an equilibrium price.  The PowerMatcher software thereby allows high shares of renewable energy to be integrated into existing electricity systems and should also avoid any local overloading in possibly aging distribution networks.&lt;ref name="kok-2013"&gt;

renpass is an electricity dispatch model which minimizes system costs for each time step (optimization) within the limits of a given infrastructure (simulation).  Time steps are optionally 15 minutes or one hour.  The method assumes perfect foresight.  renpass supports the electricity systems found in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland.

The optimization problem for each time step is to minimize the electricity supply cost using the existing power plant fleet for all regions.  After this regional dispatch, the exchange between the regions is carried out and is restricted by the grid capacity.  This latter problem is solved with a heuristic procedure rather than calculated deterministically.  The input is the merit order, the marginal power plant, the excess energy (renewable energy that could be curtailed), and the excess demand (the demand that cannot be supplied) for each region.  The exchange algorithm seeks the least cost for all regions, thus the target function is to minimize the total costs of all regions, given the existing grid infrastructure, storage, and generating capacities.  The total cost is defined as the residual load multiplied by the price in each region, summed over all regions.

A 2012 study uses renpass to examine the feasibility of a 100% renewable electricity system for the [[Baltic Sea]] region (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Sweden) in the year 2050.  The base scenario presumes conservative renewable potentials and grid enhancements, a 20% drop in demand, a moderate uptake of storage options, and the deployment of biomass for flexible generation.  The study finds that a 100% renewable electricity system is possible, albeit with occasional imports from abutting countries, and that biomass plays a key role in system stability.  The costs for this transition are estimated at 50{{nbsp}}€/MWh.&lt;ref name="bernhardi-etal-2012"&gt;

SciGRID, short for Scientific Grid, is an open source model of the German and European [[Electric power transmission|electricity transmission networks]].  The research project is managed by [http://www.next-energy.de/en/ Next Energy] (officially the EWE Research Centre for Energy Technology) located at the [[University of Oldenburg]], [[Oldenburg (Oldenburg)|Oldenburg]], Germany.  The project maintains a website and an email newsletter.  SciGRID is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses a [[PostgreSQL]] database.  The first release (v0.1) was made on 15{{nbsp}}June 2015.

SciGRID aims to rectify the lack of open research data on the structure of electricity transmission networks within Europe.  This lack of data frustrates attempts to build, characterise, and compare high resolution energy system models.  SciGRID utilizes transmission network data available from the [[OpenStreetMap]] project, available under the [[Open Database License]] (ODbL), to automatically author transmission connections.  SciGRID will not use data from closed sources.  SciGRID can also mathematically decompose a given network into a simpler representation for use in energy models.&lt;ref name="matke-etal-2015"&gt;

SWITCH is a loose acronym for solar, wind, conventional and hydroelectric generation, and transmission.  SWITCH is an optimal planning model for power systems with large shares of renewable energy.  SWITCH is being developed by the Department of Electrical Engineering, [[University of Hawai'i]], [[Mānoa]], [[Hawaii]], USA.  The project runs a small website and hosts its [[codebase]] and [[Data (computing)|datasets]] on [[GitHub]].  SWITCH is written in [[Pyomo]], an optimization components library programmed in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  It can use either the open source [[GLPK]] solver or the commercial [[CPLEX]] and [[Gurobi]] solvers.

SWITCH is a power system model, focused on renewables integration.  It can identify which generator and transmission projects to build in order to satisfy electricity demand at the lowest cost over a several year period while also reducing {{CO2}} emissions.  SWITCH utilizes multi-stage [[Stochastic linear program|stochastic linear optimization]] with the objective of minimizing the present value of the cost of power plants, transmission capacity, fuel usage, and an arbitrary per-tonne {{CO2}} charge (to represent either a carbon tax or a certificate price), over the course of a multi-year investment period.  It has two major sets of decision variables.  First, at the start of each investment period, SWITCH selects how much generation capacity to build in each of several geographic load zones, how much power transfer capability to add between these zones, and whether to operate existing generation capacity during the investment period or to temporarily mothball it to avoid fixed operation and maintenance costs.  Second, for a set of sample days within each investment period, SWITCH makes hourly decisions about how much power to generate from each dispatchable power plant, store at each [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped hydro]] facility, or transfer along each transmission interconnector.  The system must also ensure enough generation and transmission capacity to provide a planning reserve margin of 15% above the load forecasts.  For each sampled hour, SWITCH uses electricity demand and renewable power production based on actual measurements, so that the weather-driven correlations between these elements remain intact.

Following the optimization phase, SWITCH is used in a second phase to test the proposed investment plan against a more complete set of weather conditions and to add backstop generation capacity so that the planning reserve margin is always met.  Finally, in a third phase, the costs are calculated by freezing the investment plan and operating the proposed power system over a full set of weather conditions.

A 2012 paper uses [[California]] from 2012 to 2027 as a [[case study]] for SWITCH.  The study finds that there is no ceiling on the amount of wind and solar power that could be used and that these resources could potentially reduce emissions by 90% or more (relative to 1990 levels) without reducing reliability or severely raising costs.  Furthermore, policies that encourage electricity customers to shift demand to times when renewable power is most abundant (for example, though the well-timed charging of [[electric vehicle]]s) could achieve radical emission reductions at moderate cost.&lt;ref name="fripp-2012"&gt;

URBS classes as an energy modeling framework and attempts to minimize the total discounted cost of the system.  A particular model selects from a set of technologies to meet a predetermined electricity demand.  It uses a time resolution of one hour and the spatial resolution is model-defined.  The decision variables are the capacities for the production, storage, and transport of electricity and the time scheduling for their operation.&lt;ref name="huber-etal-2012"&gt;

== Open energy system models ==

Open energy system models capture some or all of the energy commodities found in an energy system.  All models include the electricity sector.  Some models add the heat sector, which can be important for countries with significant [[district heating]].  Other models add gas networks.  With the advent of [[Electric vehicle|emobility]], other models still include aspects of the transport sector.  Indeed, coupling these various sectors using [[power-to-X]] technologies is an emerging area of research.&lt;ref name="bussar-etal-2014"/&gt;

This makes Balmorel the first open energy modeling project to go public by quite a margin.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Balmorel project maintains an extensive website, from where the [[codebase]] and [[Data (computing)|dataset]]s can be download as a [[Zip (file format)|zip file]].  Users are encouraged to register.  Documentation is available from the same site.&lt;ref name="ravn-2001"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Balmorel is written in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]].

&lt;/ref&gt;  These ambitions and limitations have long since been superseded and Balmorel is no longer tied to its original geography and policy questions.&lt;ref name="ravn-2012"/&gt;  Balmorel classes as a dispatch and investment model and uses a time resolution of one hour.  It models electricity and heat supply and demand, and supports the intertemporal storage of both.  Balmorel is structured as a pure [[linear programming|linear program]] (no integer variables).

{{as of|2016}}, Balmorel has been the subject of some 22{{nbsp}}publications.  A 2008 study uses Balmorel to explore the Nordic energy system in 2050.  The focus is on renewable energy supply and the deployment of hydrogen as the main transport fuel.  Given certain assumptions about the future price of oil and carbon and the uptake of hydrogen, the model shows that it is economically optimal to cover, using renewable energy, more than 95% of the primary energy consumption for electricity and district heat and 65% of the transport.&lt;ref name="karlsson-and-meibom-2008"&gt;

The study shows that PHEVs can reduce the {{CO2}} emissions from the power system if actively integrated, whereas a hands-off approach – letting people charge their cars at will – is likely to result in an increase in emissions.&lt;ref name="goeransson-etal-2010"&gt;

Calliope is an energy system modeling framework, with a focus on flexibility, high spatial and temporal resolution, and the ability to execute different runs using the same base-case dataset.  The project is being developed at the [https://www.usys.ethz.ch/en/ Department of Environmental Systems Science], [[ETH Zurich]], [[Zürich]], Switzerland.  The project maintains a website, hosts the [[codebase]] at [[GitHub]], operates an [https://github.com/calliope-project/calliope/issues issues tracker], and runs two [[Electronic mailing list|email lists]].  Calliope is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Pyomo]] library.  It can link to the open source [[GLPK]] solver and the commercial [[CPLEX]] and [[Gurobi]] solvers.  PDF documentation is available.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A Calliope model consists of a collection of structured text files, in [[YAML]] and [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] formats, that define the technologies, locations, and resource potentials.  Calliope takes these files, constructs a pure [[Linear programming|linear optimization]] (no integer variables) problem, solves it, and reports the results in the form of [[pandas (software)|pandas]] [[data structures]] for analysis.  The framework contains five [[Abstract type|abstract]] base technologies – supply, demand, conversion, storage, transmission – from which new concrete technologies can be derived.  The design of Calliope enforces the clear separation of framework (code) and model (data).

A 2015 study uses Calliope to compare the future roles of [[nuclear power]] and [[Concentrated solar power|CSP]] in [[South Africa]].  It finds CSP could be competitive with nuclear by 2030 for baseload and more competitive when producing above baseload.  CSP also offers less investment risk, less environmental risk, and other co-benefits.&lt;ref name="pfenninger-and-keirstead-2015-a"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A second 2015 study compares a large number of cost-optimal future power systems for [[Great Britain]].  Three generation technologies are tested: renewables, nuclear power, and fossil fuels with and without [[carbon capture and storage]] (CCS).  The scenarios are assessed on financial cost, emissions reductions, and energy security.  Up to 60% of [[Variable renewable energy|variable renewable]] capacity is possible with little increase in cost, while higher shares require large-scale [[Grid energy storage|storage]], imports, and/or [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]] renewables such as [[Tidal power|tidal range]].&lt;ref name="pfenninger-and-keirstead-2015-b"&gt;

DESSTinEE stands for Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in EuropE.  DESSTinEE is a model of the European energy system in 2050 with a focus on the electricity system.  DESSTinEE is being developed primarily at the [[Imperial College Business School]], [[Imperial College London]] (ICL), [[London]], United Kingdom.  The software can be downloaded from the project website.  DESSTinEE is written in [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]/[[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]] and comprises a set of standalone [[spreadsheet]]s.  A flier is available.&lt;ref name="desstinee-2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

DESSTinEE is designed to investigate assumptions about the technical requirements for energy transport – particularly electricity – and the scale of the economic challenge to develop the necessary infrastructure.  Forty countries are considered in and around Europe and ten forms of primary and secondary energy are supported.  The model uses a predictive simulation technique, rather than solving for either [[Partial equilibrium|partial]] or [[Computable general equilibrium|general equilibrium]].  The model projects annual energy demands for each country to 2050, synthesizes hourly profiles for electricity demand in 2010 and 2050, and simulates the least-cost generation and transmission of electricity around the region.&lt;ref name="openmod-wiki-desstinee"&gt;

A 2016 study using DESSTinEE (and a second model eLOAD) examines the evolution of electricity load curves in Germany and Britain from the present until 2050.  In 2050, peak loads and ramp rates rise 20–60% and system utilization falls 15–20%, in part due to the substantial uptake of [[heat pump]]s and [[electric vehicle]]s.  These are significant changes.&lt;ref name="bossmann-and-staffell-2016"&gt;

The Energy Transition Model (ETM) is an interactive web-based model using a holistic description of a country's energy system.  It is being developed by Quintel Intelligence, [[Amsterdam]], the Netherlands.  The project maintains a project website, an interactive website, and a [[GitHub]] repository.  ETM is written in [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] (on [[Ruby on Rails|Rails]]) and displays in a [[web browser]].  ETM consists of several software components as described in the documentation.

ETM is fully interactive.  After selecting a region (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, United Kingdom, EU-27, or Brazil) and a year (2020, 2030, 2040, or 2050), the user can set 300 sliders (or enter numerical values) to explore the following:

* targets: set goals for the scenario and see if they can be achieved, targets comprise: {{CO2}} reductions, renewables shares, total cost, and caps on imports 
* demands: expand or restrict energy demand in the future
* costs: project the future costs of energy carriers and energy technologies, these costs do not include taxes or subsidies
* supplies: select which technologies can be used to produce heat or electricity

ETM is based on an energy graph ([[Directed graph|digraph]]) where nodes ([[Glossary of graph theory#vertex|vertices]]) can convert from one type of energy to another, possibly with losses.  The connections ([[Glossary of graph theory#edge|directed edges]]) are the energy flows and are characterized by volume (in [[megajoule]]s) and carrier type (such as coal, electricity, usable-heat, and so forth).  Given a demand and other choices, ETM calculates the primary energy use, the total cost, and the resulting {{CO2}} emissions.  The model is demand driven, meaning that the digraph is traversed from ''useful demand'' (such as space heating, hot water usage, and car-kilometers) to ''primary demand'' (the extraction of gas, the import of coal, and so forth).

EnergyPATHWAYS is a bottom-up energy sector model used to explore the near-term implications of long-term deep decarbonization.  The lead developer is energy and climate protection consultancy, Evolved Energy Research, [[San Francisco]], USA.  The code is hosted on [[GitHub]].  EnergyPATHWAYS is written in [[Python (computer language)|Python]] and links to the open source [[COIN-OR#CBC|Cbc]] solver.  Alternatively, the [[GLPK]], [[CPLEX]], or [[Gurobi]] solvers can be employed.  EnergyPATHWAYS utilizes the [[PostgreSQL]] [[object-relational database management system]] (ORDBMS) to manage its [[Data (computing)|data]].

EnergyPATHWAYS is a comprehensive accounting framework used to construct economy-wide energy infrastructure scenarios.  While portions of the model do use [[linear programming]] techniques, for instance, for electricity dispatch, the EnergyPATHWAYS model is not fundamentally an optimization model and embeds few decision dynamics.  EnergyPATHWAYS offers detailed energy, cost, and emissions accounting for the energy flows from primary supply to final demand.  The energy system representation is flexible, allowing for differing levels of detail and the nesting of cities, states, and countries.  The model uses hourly least-cost electricity dispatch and supports [[power-to-gas]], short-duration energy storage, long-duration energy storage, and [[demand response]].  Scenarios typically run to 2050.

A predecessor of the EnergyPATHWAYS software, named simply PATHWAYS, has been used to construct policy models.  The California PATHWAYS model was used to inform Californian state climate targets for 2030.&lt;ref name="williams-etal-2012"&gt;

ETEM is a bottom-up model that identifies the optimal energy and technology options for a regional or city.  The model finds an energy policy with minimal cost, while investing in new equipment (new technologies), developing production capacity (installed technologies), and/or proposing the feasible import/export of primary energy.  ETEM typically casts forward 50{{nbsp}}years, in two or five year steps, with time slices of four seasons using typically individual days or finer.  The spatial resolution can be highly detailed.  Electricity and heat are both supported, as are [[district heating]] networks, household energy systems, and grid storage, including the use of [[plug-in hybrid|plug-in hybrid electric vehicles]] (PHEV).  ETEM-SG, a development, supports [[demand response]], an option which would be enabled by the development of [[smart grid]]s.

The ETEM model has been applied to Luxembourg, the Geneva and Basel-Bern-Zurich cantons in Switzerland, and the Grenoble metropolitan and Midi-Pyrénées region in France.  A 2005 study uses ETEM to study climate protection in the Swiss housing sector.  The ETEM model was coupled with the GEMINI-E3 world [[Computable general equilibrium|computable general equilibrium model]] (CGEM) to complete the analysis.&lt;ref name="drouet-etal-2005"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2012 study examines the design of [[smart grid]]s.  As distribution systems become more intelligent, so must the models needed to analysis them.  ETEM is used to assess the potential of smart grid technologies using a [[case study]], roughly calibrated on the [[Geneva]] canton, under three scenarios.  These scenarios apply different constraints on {{CO2}} emissions and electricity imports.  A stochastic approach is used to deal with the uncertainty in future electricity prices and the uptake of electric vehicles.&lt;ref name="babonneau-2012"&gt;

ficus is a [[Mixed integer program|mixed integer]] optimization model for local energy systems.  It is being developed at the [https://www.ewk.ei.tum.de/en/startseite/ Institute for Energy Economy and Application Technology], [[Technical University of Munich]], [[Munich]], Germany.  The project maintains a website.  The project is hosted on [[GitHub]].  ficus is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Pyomo]] library.  The user can choose between the open source [[GLPK]] solver or the commercial [[CPLEX]] and [[Gurobi]] solvers.

Based on [[#URBS|URBS]], ficus was originally developed for optimizing the energy systems of factories and has now been extended to include local energy systems.  ficus supports multiple energy commodities – goods that can be imported or exported, generated, stored, or consumed – including electricity and heat.  It supports multiple-input and multiple-output energy conversion technologies with load-dependent efficiencies.  The objective of the model is to supply the given demand at minimal cost.  ficus uses exogenous cost time series for imported commodities as well as peak demand charges with a configurable timebase for each commodity in use.

oemof stands for Open Energy Modelling Framework.  The project is managed by the Reiner Lemoine Institute, [[Berlin]], Germany and the [http://www.znes-flensburg.de/ Center for Sustainable Energy Systems] (CSES or ZNES) at the [[University of Flensburg]] and the [[Fachhochschule Flensburg|Flensburg University of Applied Sciences]], both [[Flensburg]], Germany.  The project runs two websites and a [[GitHub]] repository.  oemof is written in [[Python (computer language)|Python]] and uses [[Pyomo]] and [[COIN-OR]] components for optimization.  Energy systems can be represented using spreadsheets ([[Comma-separated values|CSV]]) which should simplify data preparation.  {{nowrap|Version 0.1.0}} was released on 1{{nbsp}}December 2016.

oemof classes as an energy modeling framework.  It consists of a [[Linear programming|linear]] or [[Mixed integer program|mixed integer]] optimization problem formulation library (solph), an input data generation library (feedin-data), and other auxiliary libraries.  The solph library is used to represent multi-regional and multi-sectoral (electricity, heat, gas, mobility) systems and can optimize for different targets, such as financial cost or {{CO2}} emissions.  Furthermore, it is possible to switch between dispatch and investment modes.  In terms of scope, oemof can capture the European power system or alternatively it can describe a complex local power and heat sector scheme.

OSeMOSYS stands for Open Source Energy Modelling System.  OSeMOSYS is intended for national and regional policy development and uses an intertemperal optimization framework.  The model posits a single socially motivated operator/investor with perfect foresight.  The OSeMOSYS project is a community endeavor, supported by the Energy Systems Analysis Group (dESA), [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]], [[Stockholm]], Sweden.  The project maintains a website providing background. The project also offers several active [[internet forum]]s on [[Reddit]].  OSeMOSYS was originally written in [[MathProg]], a high-level [[Mathematical optimization|mathematical programming]] language.  It was subsequently reimplemented in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and all three codebases are now maintained.  The project also provides a test model called UTOPIA.&lt;ref name="lavigne-2017"/&gt;  A manual is available.&lt;ref name="moksnes-etal-2015"&gt;

OSeMOSYS provides a framework for the analysis of energy systems over the medium (10–15 years) and long term (50–100 years).  OSeMOSYS uses pure [[Linear programming|linear optimization]], with the option of [[mixed integer programming]] for the treatment of, for instance, discrete power plant capacity expansions.  It covers most energy sectors, including heat, electricity, and transport.  OSeMOSYS is driven by exogenously defined [[Energy system#Energy-services|energy services]] demands.  These are then met through a set of technologies which draw on a set of resources, both characterized by their potentials and costs.  These resources are not limited to energy commodities and may include, for example, water and [[Land use, land-use change and forestry|land-use]].  This enables OSeMOSYS to be applied in domains other than energy, such as water systems.  Technical constraints, economic restrictions, and/or environmental targets may also be imposed to reflect policy considerations.  OSeMOSYS is available in extended and compact MathProg formulations, either of which should give identical results.  In its extended version, OSeMOSYS comprises a little more than 400 [[Source lines of code|lines of code]].

PyPSA stands for Python for Power System Analysis.  PyPSA is a free software toolbox for simulating and optimizing electric power systems and allied sectors.  It supports conventional generation, variable wind and solar generation, electricity storage, [[Power-to-X#Sector coupling concepts|coupling]] to the natural gas, hydrogen, heat, and transport sectors, and hybrid alternating and direct current networks.  Moreover, PyPSA is designed to scale well.  The project is managed by the [https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/index.php Institute for Automation and Applied Informatics] (IAI), [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (KIT), [[Karlsruhe]], Germany, although the project itself exists independently under its own name and accounts.  The project maintains a website and runs an [[Electronic mailing list|email list]].  PyPSA itself is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and uses the [[Pyomo]] library.  The [[source code]] is hosted on [[GitHub]] and is also released periodically as a [[Python Package Index|PyPI]] package.

[[File:Simulated locational marginal prices produced by PyPSA energy system model.svg|thumb|left|Simulated [[Electricity market#Bid-based, security-constrained, economic dispatch with nodal prices|locational marginal prices]] across [[Germany]] under conditions of high wind and low load.  Bottlenecks in north/south power transmission elicit the large differences.&lt;ref name="brown-etal-2018-pypsa"/&gt;{{rp|11}}]]

The basic functionality of PyPSA is described in a 2018 paper.  PyPSA sits between traditional steady-state power flow analysis software and full multi-period energy system models.  It can be invoked using either non-linear power flow equations for system simulation or linearized approximations to enable the joint optimization of operations and investment across multiple periods.  Generator ramping and multi-period up and down-times can be specified, [[demand side management|DSM]] is supported, but demand remains [[price elasticity of demand|price inelastic]].&lt;ref name="brown-etal-2018-pypsa"&gt;

A 2018 study examines potential synergies between [[power-to-X#sector coupling concepts|sector coupling]] and [[electric power transmission|transmission]] reinforcement in a future European energy system constrained to reduce [[carbon dioxide equivalent|carbon]] emissions by 95%.  The PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30 model captures the [[energy demand management|demand-side management]] potential of [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEV) as well as the role that [[power-to-gas]], long-term [[thermal energy storage]], and related technologies can play.  Results indicate that BEVs can smooth the daily variations in solar power while the remaining technologies smooth the [[wiktionary:synoptic|synoptic]] and seasonal variations in both demand and renewable supply.  Substantial [[wiktionary:buildout|buildout]] of the electricity grid is required for a least-cost configuration.  More generally, such a system is both feasible and affordable.  The underlying datasets are available from [[Zenodo]].&lt;ref name="brown-etal-2018-synergies"&gt;

TEMOA stands for Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis.  The software is being developed by the Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, [[North Carolina State University]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], USA.  The project runs a website and a forum.  The [[source code]] is hosted on [[GitHub]].  The model is programmed in [[Pyomo]], an optimization components library written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  TEMOA can be used with any solver that [[Pyomo]] supports, including the open source [[GLPK]] solver.  TEMOA uses [[version control]] to publicly archive [[source code]] and [[Data (computing)|datasets]] and thereby enable third-parties to verify all published modeling work.&lt;ref name="decarolis-etal-2012"&gt;

TEMOA classes as a modeling framework and is used to conduct analysis using a bottom-up, technology rich energy system model.  The model objective is to minimize the system-wide cost of energy supply by deploying and utilizing energy technologies and commodities over time to meet a set of [[wiktionary:exogenous|exogenously]] specified end-use demands.&lt;ref name="hunter-etal-2013"&gt;

== Programming components ==

=== Component models ===

A number of technical component models are now also open source.  While these component models do not constitute systems models aimed at public policy development (the focus of this page), they nonetheless warrant a mention.  Component models can be linked or otherwise adapted into these broader initiatives.

A number of electricity auction models have been written in [[General Algebraic Modeling System|GAMS]], [[AMPL]], [[MathProg]], and other languages.{{efn|
[[MathProg]] is a subset of [[AMPL]].  It is sometimes possible to convert an AMPL model into MathProg without much effort.
}}  These include:

=== Open solvers ===

Many projects rely on a [[Linear programming|pure linear]] or [[Mixed integer program|mixed integer]] solver to perform classical optimization, constraint satisfaction, or some mix of the two.  While there are several open source solver projects, the most commonly deployed solver is [[GLPK]].  GLPK has been adopted by [[#Calliope|Calliope]], [[#ETEM|ETEM]], [[#ficus|ficus]], [[#OSeMOSYS|OSeMOSYS]], [[#SWITCH|SWITCH]], and [[#TEMOA|TEMOA]].  Another alternative is the Clp solver.&lt;ref name="clp-homepage"&gt;
{{cite web

{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Proprietary solvers outperform open source solvers by a considerable margin (perhaps ten-fold), so choosing an open solver will limit performance in terms of both speed and memory consumption.&lt;ref name="koch-etal-2011"&gt;

In [[entertainment]], an '''origin story''' is an account or [[back-story]] revealing how a [[Character (arts)|character]] or group of people become a [[protagonist]] or [[antagonist]], and it adds to the overall study of a [[narrative]], often giving reasons for their intentions.

In [[American comic book]]s, it also refers to how characters gained their [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s and/or the circumstances under which they became [[superhero]]es or [[supervillain]]s. In order to keep their characters current, comic book companies, as well as cartoon companies, game companies, children's show companies, and toy companies, frequently rewrite the origins of their oldest characters. This goes from adding details that do not contradict earlier facts to a totally new origin which makes it seem that it is an altogether different character.

A [[pourquoi story]], also dubbed an "origin story", is also used in [[mythology]], referring to narratives of how a world began, how creatures and plants came into existence, and why certain things in the cosmos have certain yet distinct qualities.

== Critical explorations of the origin story ==

In ''The Superhero Reader'' (nominated for a 2014 [[Eisner Award]] for Best Scholarly/Academic Work), edited by Charles Hatfield (Professor at University of Connecticut), Jeet Heer (Toronto-based journalist), and Dr. Kent Worcester (Professor of Political Science at [[Marymount Manhattan College]]), the editors write in "Section One: Historical Considerations":  "Almost all superheroes have an origin story: a bedrock account of the transformative events that set the protagonist apart from ordinary humanity. If not a prerequisite for the superhero genre, the origin... is certainly a prominent and popular trope that recurs so frequently as to offer clues to the nature of this narrative tradition. To read stories about destroyed worlds, murdered parents, genetic mutations, and mysterious power-giving wizards is to realize the degree to which the superhero genre is about transformation, about identity, about difference, and about the tension between psychological rigidity and a flexible and fluid sense of human nature. ... When surveying the superhero genre, preliminary questions often turn to the problem of roots." The book has a wealth of pertinent bibliographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hatfield, Charles|title= The Superhero Reader |location= Jackson, Mississippi |publisher= University Press of Mississippi |year= 2013 |page= 3 |ISBN= 9781617038068|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English professors Dr. Alex Romagnoli and Dr. Gian S. Pagnucci, of [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]], discuss in their book ''Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature'' "the nature of superhero origin stories and how the writing of these origin stories helps make superhero narratives a unique literary genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Romagnoli |first1= Alex S. |last2= Pagnucci |first2= Gian S. |title= Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature |chapter= Introduction |location= Lanham, Maryland |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield#Scarecrow Books|Scarecrow Books]] |year= 2013 |page= 3 |ISBN= 0-810-89171-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they write, "Superheroes get very complicated when it comes to their histories, but one part of their stories remains forever constant and important. Even more than 'death' stories, [[Fictional crossover|crossovers]], event stories, and attire changes, origin stories are the core of superheroes' existences. Origins not only reflect the sociohistorical contexts in which heroes were created, but they also reflect a culture's understanding of what makes superheroes storytelling unique vehicles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Romagnoli |first1= Alex S. |last2= Pagnucci |first2= Gian S. |title= Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature |chapter= 6. Superhero Storytelling |location= Lanham, Maryland |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield#Scarecrow Books|Scarecrow Books]] |year= 2013 |page= 109 |ISBN= 0-810-89171-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Romagnoli and Pagnucci go on to explain why the origin story is as important to the audience as to the generations of writers who continue heroic tales.

Dr. Randy Duncan (comics scholar and professor of communication, Henderson State University, Arkadelphia, Arkansas) and Dr. Matthew J. Smith (Department of Communication, Wittenberg University, Springfield, Ohio) use the origin story of [[Spider-Man]] as an example of how a [[Character (arts)|character]] can be created by the persistence of a writer who has definite preferences in creating a character's personality, even if the publisher resists. "It is difficult to discern which is more often told: Spider-Man's origin or the tales told around that origin. All reveal fascinating aspects of a teenage loner fatefully 'bitten by a radioactive spider' to find himself with 'the proportionate strength and agility of an arachnid'." Duncan and Smith explain how [[Stan Lee]] butted heads with publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]], who worried about an "ick factor," but Lee prevailed. "The entire Spider-Man concept resonates with the primary attributes of many genres and traditions," the authors say. "Like a heady puree of [Mary] Shelley's ''[[Frankenstein]]'', Bob Kane's Batman, and Franz Kafka's ''Metamorphosis'', Spider-Man's origin invokes gothic and crime fiction motifs like the ostracized genius, doomed loved ones, the misuse or misfiring of science, the gritty noir city, the driven vigilante, and the fateful [[Uncanny|'return of the repressed']]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Duncan |first1= Randy |last2= Smith |first2= Matthew J. |title= Icons of the American Comic Book: From Captain America to Wonder Woman |location= Santa Barbara, CA |publisher= Greenwood Press |series= (Series: Greenwood icons) |year= 2013 |volume= Vol. 1 |page= 684 |ISBN= 9780313399237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors proceed to investigate these various issues of the origin story.

[T]he death of Peter Parker's uncle powerfully shapes his hero ethos and his desire to fight crime. ... [Footnote 1] There are three notable differences between the film and the comic versions of the Spider-Man origin. The first is that in the comic, Peter Parker was not provoked in any way to allow the thief to escape (as he was in the film by the rude behavior of the promoter). The second is that in ''Amazing Fantasy #15'', Uncle Ben never utters the line "With great power comes great responsibility." Rather, this line is stated in the final narration. The third is that in the film, Uncle Ben is killed while waiting for Peter in the car, but in the comic, he's killed in a home invasion. Notably, in more recent issues of the comic, Uncle Ben's murder and the origin of the "great responsibility" line have been retroactively changed ("[[Retroactive continuity|retconned]]") to fit with the movie version. |ISBN= 978-0-470-57560-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Duncan |first1= Randy |last2= Smith |first2= Matthew J. |title= Icons of the American Comic Book: From Captain America to Wonder Woman |location= Santa Barbara, CA |publisher= Greenwood Press |series= (Series: Greenwood icons) |year= 2013 |volume= 1 |page= 684 |isbn= 9780313399237 |quote= In the final panel of his origin story, a devastated Spider-Man turns away from readers: 'a lean and silent figure' fades 'into the gathering darkness, aware at last that in this world, with great power must also come – great responsibility!'

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10221">'''Political globalization''' refers to the growth of the worldwide [[political system]], both in size and complexity. That system includes [[Government|national government]]s, their [[governmental organizations|governmental]] and [[intergovernmental organizations]] as well as government-independent elements of [[global civil society]] such as [[international non-governmental organizations]] and [[social movement organization]]s. One of the key aspects of the political globalization is the declining importance of the [[nation-state]] and the rise of other actors on the political scene. The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] has been called one of the classic examples of political globalization.

Political globalization is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature, with the two other being [[economic globalization]] and [[cultural globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA146|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William R. Thompson]] has defined it as "the expansion of a global political system, and its institutions, in which inter-regional transactions (including, but certainly not limited to trade) are managed".&lt;ref name="ModelskiDevezas2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Modelski|author2=Tessaleno Devezas|author3=William R.

Moghadam defined it as "an increasing trend toward [[multilateralism]] (in which the [[United Nations]] plays a key role), toward an emerging 'transnational state apparatus,' and toward the emergence of national and [[international nongovernmental organizations]] that act as watchdogs over governments and have increased their activities and influence".&lt;ref name="Moghadam2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Valentine M. Moghadam|title=Globalizing Women: Transnational Feminist Networks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SuIt1k8wCp8C&amp;pg=PA35|date=20 January 2005|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8024-7|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manfred B. Steger]] in turn wrote that it "refers to the intensification and expansion of political interrelations across the globe".&lt;ref name="Steger2003-56"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B.

But it also refers to the spread and influence of [[international non-governmental organization]]s, [[social movement organization]]s and transnational advocacy networks operating across borders and constituting a kind of [[global civil society]]."&lt;ref name="AmentaNash2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Crouch|chapter=Democracy and Capitalism in the Wake of the Financial Crisis|editor1=Edwin Amenta|editor2=Kate Nash|editor3=Alan Scott|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Political Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uz8gk5-a5CUC&amp;pg=PT487|date=2 February 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5507-9|page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Gerard Delanty]] and [[Chris Rumford]] define it as "a tension between three processes which interact to produce the complex field of [[global politics]]: global [[geopolitics]], global [[normative culture]] and [[polycentric networks]]."&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-414"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerard Delanty|author2=Chris Rumford|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Political Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
[[Salvatore Babones]] discussing sources used by scholars for studying political globalizations noted the usefulness of [[Europa World Year Book]] for data on diplomatic relationships between countries, publications of [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] such as ''The Military Balance'' for matters of military, and US government publication ''Patterns of Global Terrorism'' for matters of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-152"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political globalization is measured by aggregating and weighting data on the number of embassies and high commissioners in a country, the number of the country's membership in international organization, its participation in the UN peacekeeping missions, and the number of international treaties signed by said country. This measure has been used by [[Axel Dreher]], [[Noel Gaston]], [[Pim Martens]] [[Jeffrey Haynes]] and is available from the [[KOF institute]] at [[ETH Zurich]]&lt;ref name="Haynes2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Haynes|title=Religion and Political Change in the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8z-DCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT64|date=7 September 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-69699-5|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Welfens2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul J.J.

==Aspects==
[[Dimensions of globalization|Like globalization itself]], political globalization has several dimensions and lends itself to a number of interpretations. It has been discussed in the context of new emancipatory possibilities, as well as in the context of loss of autonomy and fragmentation of the social world.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-414"/&gt; Political globalization can be seen in changes such as [[democratization]] of the world, creation of the global [[civil society]],&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-426"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerard Delanty|author2=Chris Rumford|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Political Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moving beyond the centrality of the [[nation-state]], particularly as the sole actor in the field of politics.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"/&gt; Some of the questions central to the discussion of the political globalization are related to the future of the nation-state, whether its importance is diminishing and what are the causes for those changes; and understanding the emergence of the concept of [[global governance]].&lt;ref name="Steger2003-57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B. Steger|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgVRoIOhYegC&amp;pg=PA57|date=27 March 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] has been called one of the classic examples of political globalization.&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annabelle Mooney|author2=Betsy Evans|title=Globalization: The Key Concepts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCV-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194|date=12 March 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-20472-4|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political actions by non-governmental organizations and social movements, concerned about various topics such as [[environmental protection]], is another example.&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"/&gt;

[[David Held]] has proposed that continuing political globalization may lead to the creation of a [[world government]]-like [[cosmopolitan democracy]], though this vision has also been criticized as too idealistic.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-68"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B. Steger|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgVRoIOhYegC&amp;pg=PA68|date=27 March 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Globalization and Nation State==
There is a heated debate over Political Globalization and Nation State. The question arises whether or not political globalization signifies the decline of the nation-state. Hyper globalists argue that globalization has engulfed today's world in such a way that state boundaries are beginning to lose significance. However, skeptics disregard this as naiveté, believing that the nation-state remains the supreme actor in international relations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://internationalaffairsbd.com/political-globalization-nation-state/|title=Contemporary Debate on Political Globalization and Nation StateYeg=PA68|author=|first=|last2=|date=2017|publisher=International Affairs, UK|year=|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|location=|page=68|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18043">The exploration of [[politics]] in [[science fiction]] is arguably older than the identification of the [[genre]].  One of the earliest works of modern science fiction, [[H. G. Wells]]’ ''[[The Time Machine]]'', is an extrapolation of the class structure of the [[United Kingdom]] of his time, an extreme form of [[Social Darwinism]]; during tens of thousands of years, human beings have [[evolution|evolved]] into two different species based on their social class.

==Speculative societies==
Most story and novel-length works of science fiction include speculation (directly or indirectly) on modes of life and [[behaviour]]. They are sometimes [[Allegory|allegorical]] and often serious attempts to model possible future societies, political institutions and systems. Examples include [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison's]] novel ''[[Make Room! Make Room!]]'', ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]; and the [[Hostile Takeover Trilogy|''Hostile Takeover'' Trilogy]] by [[S. Andrew Swann]]. 
Imagined societies may be based on very different assumptions. Often the future is modeled on historic forms - feudalism,  or in the case of The Foundation series, the Roman Empire.  A common theme is the integration of humanity into some greater interstellar society. A popular modern example is the [[Uplift series|''Uplift'' series]] by David Brin where a species' status is defined based on the concept of [[biological uplift|biologically uplifting]] other species.

==Utopian societies==
{{main|Utopia}}
The term Utopia was invented by [[Thomas More]] as the title of his Latin book ''[[De Optimo Reipublicae Statu deque Nova Insula Utopia]]'' (circa 1516), known more commonly as Utopia. He created the word "utopia" to suggest two Greek neologisms simultaneously: outopia (no place) and eutopia (good place). More depicts a rationally organised society, through the narration of an explorer who discovers it—Raphael Hythlodaeus. Utopia is a republic where all property is held in common. In addition, it has few laws, no lawyers and rarely sends its citizens to war, but hires mercenaries from among its war-prone neighbours.

Generally speaking, utopias are generally societies whose author believes either perfect, or as perfect as can be attainable.  [[Ernest Callenbach]]'s ''[[Ecotopia]]'' is a contemporary example.  This can cause some confusion, in that some works generally recognized as “utopian”, such as [[Republic (Plato)|Plato’s ''Republic'']], can come across as much less than ideal to a modern reader.  They are one of the smaller subsets of political science fiction, possibly because it is difficult to create dramatic tension in a world the author believes is perfect.  Various authors get around this problem by postulating problems in the utopian society, such [[L. Neil Smith]] does.  Other ways of presenting a utopian society in science fiction, is to send characters outside it to explore beyond its confines (ala ''[[Star Trek]]''), or focus on an outsider character entering the society, as in [[Aldous Huxley]]’s ''[[Brave New World]]''.  This last method is often used to show that the utopian society shown is actually a [[dystopia]].  [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s approach in ''The [[Mars Trilogy]]'' involved exploring the creation of utopian and [[ecotopia]]n societies on Mars.

Another option for a Utopian society can be found in [[robotocracy]], or the rule of Robots or Computers, with the theory that a programmed machine can dispassionately provide for the welfare of all.  Examples of this include various works of [[Isaac Asimov]] and the planet of Sigma Draconis VI in the Star Trek episode "[[Spock's Brain (TOS episode)|Spock's Brain]]".  If the machine rule becomes harsh or oppressive, it may become a dystopia instead.

==Dystopian societies==
{{main|Dystopia}}
Dystopias are societies where the author illustrates the worst that can happen.  Usually this encompasses extrapolating trends the author sees as dangerous. During the 20th century many examples were written in reaction to the rise of [[Nazism]], [[Communism]] and [[Religious Fundamentalism]]:

*''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]] which illustrates the ultimate [[totalitarian]] state in which the government is in control of every aspect of human existence, using [[propaganda]], universal [[surveillance]], and [[torture]].
*''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]] was written after the war in response to [[Fascism]]. It is set in a world where the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] forces have won [[World War II]] and are rival [[superpower]]s. In it the main characters argue and are involved in politics and power.
*''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' by [[Margaret Atwood]] tells the tale of a woman caught up in a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian]] [[dictatorship]] where women are forced into a system of sexual [[slavery]] for the ruling [[patriarchy]].

It is important to keep in mind that scenarios which some would describe as dystopic, others would describe as utopian. [[Norman Spinrad|Norman Spinrad's]] novel'' [[The Iron Dream]]'' was generally recognised to be a dystopic novel, but lauded by neo-Nazis as a utopia.

==Politics==
Often the political focus of a science fiction novel is less on the social order, but how people maneuver and achieve their agendas within a given system. Many [[space opera]]s rely on vast interstellar bureaucracies to drive their plots ''(see: [[Galactic empire]])''. [[George Lucas]]'s famous ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga [[Star Wars#Themes|features political science]] modeled after historic events. The Retief stories by [[Keith Laumer]] and the [[The Chanur Novels|Chanur books]] by [[C. J. Cherryh]] have politics and political maneuverings as some of the main themes, and [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'' books offer advanced explorations of human politics, including the dovetailing economics. Often this focus can descend into [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] and [[paranoia]] where the premise is that there are secret forces out to get the protagonists, the seminal example of which is the ''[[Illuminatus! Trilogy]]''. Most commonly, science fiction deals with the political fallout of its own premises.  A story will posit some new event or technology and explore its political dimensions; this includes most [[techno-thriller]]s but also encompasses a large body of traditional science fiction. An example is the [[Philip K. Dick]] story ''[[The Minority Report]]'' (upon which the [[Minority Report (film)|film]] starring [[Tom Cruise]] is based), which introduces the idea of perfectly predicting a crime of violence so the perpetrator can be arrested before the crime is committed, and the political and legal ramifications of actually using such a system.

'''Scientific literature''' comprises scholarly [[publication]]s that report original [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] and [[theoretical]] work in the [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s, and within an academic field, often abbreviated as '''the literature'''.  [[Academic publishing]] is the process of contributing the results of one's [[research]] into the literature, which often requires a peer-review process. Original [[scientific research]] published for the first time in [[scientific journal]]s is called the [[primary literature]]. Patents and [[technical report]]s, for minor research results and engineering and design work (including computer software), can also be considered primary literature. [[Secondary source]]s include review articles (which summarize the findings of published studies to highlight advances and new lines of research) and [[book]]s (for large projects or broad arguments, including compilations of articles). [[Tertiary source]]s might include [[encyclopedia]]s and similar works intended for broad public consumption.

== Types of scientific publications ==

Scientific literature can include the following kinds of publications:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Öchsner|first=Andreas|title=Types of Scientific Publications|date=2013|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38646-6_3|work=Introduction to Scientific Publishing|pages=9–21|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38646-6_3|isbn=9783642386459|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* scientific articles published in [[Scientific journal|scientific journals]]
* [[Patent|patents]] specialized for science and technology (for example, [[Biological patent|biological patents]] and [[Chemical patent|chemical patents]])
* [[Book|books]] wholly written by one or a small number of co-[[Author|authors]]
* [[Edited volume|edited volumes]], where each [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] is the responsibility of a different author or set of authors, while the [[Editing|editor]] is responsible for determining the scope of the project, keeping the work on schedule, and ensuring consistency of style and content
* presentations at [[Academic conference|academic conferences]], especially those organized by [[Learned society|learned societies]]
* [[government]] reports such as a [[forensic investigation]] conducted by a government agency such as the [[NTSB]]
* scientific publications on the [[World Wide Web]]
* books, [[Technical report|technical reports]], [[Pamphlet|pamphlets]], and [[Working paper|working papers]] issued by individual researchers or research organizations on their own initiative; these are sometimes organised into a series
* [[blogs]] and science forums

Literature may also be published in areas considered to be "[[Grey literature|grey]]", as they are published outside of traditional channels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This material is traditionally not indexed by major databases and can include manuals, theses and dissertations, or newsletters and bulletins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The significance of different types of the scientific publications can vary between disciplines and change over time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} According to James G. Speight and Russell Foote, peer-reviewed journals are the most prominent and prestigious form of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ORgP4AwPtQC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;lpg=PA241&amp;dq=peer-reviewed+journal+articles+remain+the+predominant+publication+type,+and+have+the+highest+prestige.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ssTqWvQvWE&amp;sig=nLzMKCNc2qRGt3auPXHrH7TXh54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjSwLGLpqLeAhXEzlMKHc9xDUcQ6AEwAXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=peer-reviewed%20journal%20articles%20remain%20the%20predominant%20publication%20type,%20and%20have%20the%20highest%20prestige.&amp;f=false|title=Ethics in Science and Engineering|last=Speight|first=James G.|last2=Foote|first2=Russell|date=2011-04-27|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9781118104842|location=|pages=241|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally books published by university presses are usually considered more prestigious than those published by commercial presses.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The status of working papers and [[conference proceeding]]s depends on the discipline; they are typically more important in the [[applied sciences]]. The value of publication as a [[preprint]] or scientific report on the web has in the past been low, but in some subjects, such as [[mathematics]] or [[high energy physics]], it is now an accepted alternative.{{citationneeded|date=October 2018}}

=== Scientific papers and articles ===
There are ten different types of scientific papers. Eight of these carry specific objectives, while the other two can vary depending on the style and the intended goal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peh|first=Wilfred|date=2008|title=Basic structure and types of scientific papers|url=|journal=Effective Medical Writing|volume=|pages=|via=Singapore Medical Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papers that carry specific objectives are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

* '''The original article''' provides new information from original research usually supported by statistics.
* '''case reports''' are unique events that researchers look at to gain information on what they are researching.
* '''technical notes''' this is a description of a technique or piece of equipment that has been modified from an existing one to be new and more effective.
* '''[[pictorial essay]]''' are a series of images high in quality that's goal is to teach what the pictures are of.
* '''[[Review article|review]]''' is a detailed analysis of recent developments on a topic.
* '''commentary''' is a short summery of an author's personal experience.
* '''[[Editorial|editorials]]''' are short reviews or critiques of original articles.
* '''letters to the editor''', these are comments directed to the editor of an article to ask questions and provide constructive criticism.

These two have varying types of scientific classifications and can range from historical articles to speeches:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''other.''' Other types of papers not listed under non scientific material or any of the 8 above types of scientific publications are put into this category and vary depending on the objective and style of the article.
* '''nonscientific material.''' This type of material comes from the result of an article being published. it does not advance an article scientifically but instead contributes to its reputation as a scientific article.

==Scientific article==

===Preparation===
The actual day-to-day records of scientific information are kept in research notebooks or logbooks. These are usually kept indefinitely as the basic evidence of the work, and are often kept in duplicate, signed, notarized, and archived. The purpose is to preserve the evidence for scientific priority, and in particular for priority for obtaining patents. They have also been used in scientific disputes.  Since the availability of computers, the notebooks in some data-intensive fields have been kept as database records, and appropriate software is commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

The work on a project is typically published as one or more technical reports, or articles. In some fields both are used, with preliminary reports, working papers, or [[preprint]]s followed by a formal article. Articles are usually prepared at the end of a project, or at the end of components of a particularly large one. In preparing such an article vigorous rules for [[scientific writing]] have to be followed.

===Language===
{{see also|Impact factor|Copy editing}} 

Often, career advancement depends upon publishing in high-impact journals, which, especially in hard and applied sciences, are usually published in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | title=MEDLINE Fact Sheet | publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] | location=Washington DC | accessdate=October 15, 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016122141/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | archivedate=October 16, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, scientists with poor English writing skills are at a disadvantage when trying to publish in these journals, regardless of the quality of the scientific study itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pan, Z|title=Crossing the language limitations|journal=PLOS Medicine |volume=3|pages=E410|year=2006|pmid=17002510|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030410|last2=Gao|first2=J|issue=9|pmc=1576334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet many{{which|date=August 2018}} international universities require publication in these high-impact journals by both their students and faculty. One way that some international authors are beginning to overcome this problem is by contracting with freelance medical copy editors who are native speakers of English and specialize in ESL (English as a second language) editing to polish their manuscripts' English to a level that high-impact journals will accept.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===Structure and style===
{{main|IMRAD}}
A scientific article has a standardized structure, which varies only slightly in different subjects. Although the IMRAD structure emphasizes the organization of content and in scientific journal articles, each section (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) has unique conventions for scientific writing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.routledge.com/Scientific-And-Medical-Communication-A-Guide-For-Effective-Practice/Mogull/p/book/9781138842557|title=Scientific And Medical Communication: A Guide For Effective Practice|last=Mogull|first=Scott A.|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781138842557|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, it is not the format that is important, but what lies behind it--the content. However, several key formatting requirements need to be met:

#The title attracts readers' attention and informs them about the contents of the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langdon-Neuner|first=Elise|title=Titles in medical articles: What do we know about them?|journal=The Write Stuff|year=2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=158–160|url=http://www.emwa.org/members/indevelopment/neuner.pd|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Titles are distinguished into three main types: declarative titles (state the main conclusion), descriptive titles (describe a paper's content), and interrogative titles (challenge readers with a question that is answered in the text).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vasilev|first=Martin|title=How to write a good title for journal articles|url=http://jeps.efpsa.org/blog/2012/09/01/how-to-write-a-good-title-for-journal-articles/|work=JEPS Bulletin|publisher=European Federation of Psychology Students’ Associations|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some journals indicate, in their instructions to authors, the type (and length) of permitted titles.
#The names and affiliations of all authors are given. In the wake of some [[scientific misconduct]] cases, publishers often require that all co-authors know and agree on the content of the article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scientific fraud#Responsibility of authors and of coauthors]]&lt;/ref&gt;
#An [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] summarizes the work (in a single paragraph or in several short paragraphs) and is intended to represent the article in bibliographic databases and to furnish [[subject metadata]] for indexing services.
# The context of previous scientific investigations should be presented, by citation relevant documents in the existing literature, usually in a section called an "Introduction".
# Empirical techniques, laid out in a section usually called "Materials and Methods", should be described in such a way that a subsequent scientist, with appropriate knowledge of and experience in the relevant field, should be able to repeat the observations and know whether he or she has obtained the same result. This naturally varies between subjects, and does not apply to mathematics and related subjects.
#Similarly, the results of the investigation, in a section usually called "Results", data should be presented in tabular or graphic form ([[image]], [[chart]], [[schematic]], [[diagram]] or [[drawing]]). These display elements should be accompanied by a caption and discussed in the text of the article.
# Interpretation of the meaning of the results is usually addressed in a "Discussion" or "Conclusions" section. The conclusions drawn should be based on the new empirical results while taking established knowledge into consideration, in such a way that any reader with knowledge of the field can follow the argument and confirm that the conclusions are sound.  That is, acceptance of the conclusions must not depend on personal [[appeal to authority|authority]], [[rhetoric|rhetorical skill]], or [[faith]].
# Finally, a "References" or "Literature Cited" section lists the sources cited by the authors.

== Peer review ==
{{main|Scholarly peer review}}
Though peer review and the learned journal format are not themselves an essential part of scientific literature, they are both convenient ways of ensuring that the above fundamental criteria are met. They are essentially a means of [[quality control]], a term which also encompasses other means towards the same goal.

The "quality" being referred to here is the scientific one, which consists of transparency and repeatability of the research for independent verification, the validity of the conclusions and interpretations drawn from the reported data, overall importance for advance within a given field of knowledge, novelty, and in certain fields applicability as well. The lack of peer review is what makes most [[technical report]]s and World Wide Web publications unacceptable as contributions to the literature. The relatively weak peer review often applied to books and chapters in edited books means that their status is also second-tier, unless an author's personal standing is so high that prior achievement and a continued stake in one's reputation within the scientific community signals a clear expectation of quality.

The emergence of institutional digital repositories where scholars can post their work as it is submitted to a print-based journal has taken formal peer review into a state of flux. Though publicizing a preprint online does not prevent it from being peer reviewed, it does allow an unreviewed copy to be widely circulated. On the positive side this change has led to faster dissemination of novel work within the scientific community; on the negative it has made it more difficult to discern a valid scientific contribution from the unmeritorious.

Increasing reliance on [[Indexing and abstracting service|abstracting service]]s, especially on those available electronically, means that the effective criterion for whether a publication format forms part of the established, trusted literature is whether it is covered by these services; in particular, by the specialised service for the discipline concerned such as [[Chemical Abstracts Service]], and by the major interdisciplinary services such as those marketed by the [[Institute for Scientific Information]].

==Ethics==
The transfer of [[copyright]] from author to publisher, used by some journals, can be controversial because many authors want to propagate their ideas more widely and re-use their material elsewhere without the need for permission. Usually an author or authors circumvent that problem by rewriting an article and using other pictures. Some publishers may also want publicity for their journal so will approve [[facsimile]] [[reproduction]] unconditionally; other publishers are more resistant. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

{{C. S. Peirce articles}}
[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] began writing on [[semiotics]], which he also called semeiotics, meaning the philosophical study of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]], in the 1860s, around the time that he devised his system of [[Categories (Peirce)|three categories]]. During the 20th century, the term "semiotics" was adopted to cover all tendencies of sign researches, including [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s [[semiology]], which began in linguistics as a completely separate tradition. 

Peirce adopted the term ''[[semiosis]]'' (or ''semeiosis'') and defined it to mean an "action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of ''three'' subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this trirelative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs".&lt;ref&gt;1906, EP 2:411 and CP 5.484. Peirce went on to say: "''Σημείωσις'' [Sêmeíôsis] in Greek of the Roman period, as early as Cicero's time, if I remember rightly, meant the action of almost any kind of sign; and my definition confers on anything that so acts the title of a 'sign.'" See [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dshmei%2Fwsis ''Σημείωσις'' in the Liddell &amp; Scott Ancient Greek lexicon] at the Perseus Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt;  This specific type of [[triadic relation]] is fundamental to Peirce's understanding of "logic as formal semiotic". By "logic" he meant philosophical logic. He [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|eventually divided]] (philosophical) logic, or formal semiotics, into (1) speculative grammar, or stechiology on the elements of semiosis (sign, object, interpretant), how signs can signify and, in relation to that, what kinds of signs, objects, and interpretants there are, how signs combine, and how some signs embody or incorporate others; (2) logical critic, or logic proper, on the modes of inference; and (3) speculative rhetoric, or methodeutic, the philosophical theory of inquiry, including [[Pragmaticism|his form of pragmatism]]. His speculative grammar, or stechiology, is this article's subject.

Peirce conceives of and discusses things like representations, interpretations, and assertions broadly and in terms of philosophical logic, rather than in terms of psychology, linguistics, or social studies. He places philosophy at a level of generality between mathematics and the special sciences of nature and mind, such that it draws principles from mathematics and supplies principles to special sciences.&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of philosophy, see for instance "A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic", CP 1.183-186, 1903 and "Minute Logic", CP 1.239-241, 1902. See Peirce's definitions of philosophy at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/cenoscopy.html Cenoscopy]" and "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/philosophy.html Philosophy]".&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, his semiotic theory does not resort to special experiences or special experiments in order to settle its questions. On the other hand, he draws continually on examples from common experience, and his semiotics is not contained in a mathematical or deductive system and does not proceed chiefly by drawing necessary conclusions about purely hypothetical objects or cases. As philosophical logic, it is ''about'' the drawing of conclusions deductive, inductive, or hypothetically explanatory. Peirce's semiotics, in its classifications, its critical analysis of kinds of inference, and its theory of inquiry, is philosophical logic studied in terms of signs and their triadic relations as positive phenomena in general.

==Semiotic elements==
{{Semiotics}}
Here is Peirce's definition of the triadic sign relation that formed the core of his definition of logic.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Namely, a sign is something, ''A'', which brings something, ''B'', its ''interpretant'' sign determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence with something, ''C'', its ''object'', as that in which itself stands to ''C''. (Peirce 1902, NEM 4, 20–21).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition, together with Peirce's definitions of ''correspondence'' and ''determination'', is sufficient to derive all of the statements that are necessarily true for all sign relations. Yet, there is much more to the theory of signs than simply proving universal theorems about generic sign relations. There is also the task of classifying the various species and subspecies of sign relations. As a practical matter, of course, familiarity with the full range of concrete examples is indispensable to theory and application both.

In Peirce's theory of signs, a ''sign'' is something that stands in a well-defined kind of relation to two other things, its ''object'' and its ''interpretant sign''. Although Peirce's definition of a sign is independent of psychological subject matter and his theory of signs covers more ground than linguistics alone, it is nevertheless the case that many of the more familiar examples and illustrations of sign relations will naturally be drawn from [[linguistics]] and [[psychology]], along with our ordinary experience of their subject matters.

For example, one way to approach the concept of an interpretant is to think of a psycholinguistic process. In this context, an interpretant can be understood as a sign's effect on the mind, or on anything that acts like a mind, what Peirce calls a ''quasi-mind''. An interpretant is what results from a process of interpretation, one of the types of activity that falls under the heading of ''semiosis''. One usually says that a sign stands ''for'' an object ''to'' an agent, an interpreter. In the upshot, however, it is the sign's effect on the agent that is paramount. This effect is what Peirce called the ''interpretant sign'', or the ''interpretant'' for short. An interpretant in its barest form is a sign's meaning, implication, or ramification, and especial interest attaches to the types of semiosis that proceed from obscure signs to relatively clear interpretants. In logic and mathematics the most clarified and most succinct signs for an object are called ''[[canonical form]]s'' or ''[[Normal form (abstract rewriting)|normal forms]]''.

Peirce argued that logic is the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are [[Indexicality|indexical]] such as reactions. Peirce held that "all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., CP 5.448 footnote, from "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; along with their representational and inferential relations. He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs. (Peirce, 1868&lt;ref&gt;"Questions Concerning Certain Faculties Claimed for Man" (''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/question/qu-frame.htm Eprint]), ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' vol. 2 (1868), pp. 103-114. Reprinted (CP 5.213-263, the quote is from para. 253).&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thought is not necessarily connected with a brain. It appears in the work of bees, of crystals, and throughout the purely physical world; and one can no more deny that it is really there, than that the colors, the shapes, etc., of objects are really there. Consistently adhere to that unwarrantable denial, and you will be driven to some form of idealistic nominalism akin to Fichte's. Not only is thought in the organic world, but it develops there. But as there cannot be a General without Instances embodying it, so there cannot be thought without Signs. We must here give "Sign" a very wide sense, no doubt, but not too wide a sense to come within our definition. Admitting that connected Signs must have a Quasi-mind, it may further be declared that there can be no isolated sign. Moreover, signs require at least two Quasi-minds; a Quasi-utterer and a Quasi-interpreter; and although these two are at one (i.e., are one mind) in the sign itself, they must nevertheless be distinct. In the Sign they are, so to say, welded. Accordingly, it is not merely a fact of human Psychology, but a necessity of Logic, that every logical evolution of thought should be dialogic. (Peirce, 1906&lt;ref&gt;"Prolegomena To an Apology For Pragmaticism", pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA492 492]–546, ''The Monist'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA479 vol. XVI, no. 4] (mislabeled "VI"), Oct. 1906, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA523 p. 523]. Reprinted CP 4.530–572; see para. 551 [http://www.existentialgraphs.com/peirceoneg/prolegomena.htm Eprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905164710/http://www.existentialgraphs.com/peirceoneg/prolegomena.htm |date=2007-09-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; )&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Sign relation===

Signhood is a way of being in relation, not a way of being in itself. Anything is a sign — not as itself, but in some relation to another. The role of sign is constituted as one role among three: object, sign, and interpretant sign. It is an irreducible triadic relation; the roles are distinct even when the things that fill them are not. The roles are but three: a sign of an object leads to interpretants, which, as signs, lead to further interpretants. In various relations, the same thing may be sign or semiotic object. The question of what a sign is depends on the concept of a ''[[sign relation]]'', which depends on the concept of a ''[[triadic relation]]''. This, in turn, depends on the concept of a ''[[Relation (mathematics)|relation]]'' itself. Peirce depended on mathematical ideas about the [[Relation reduction|reducibility]] of relations — dyadic, triadic, tetradic, and so forth. According to Peirce's Reduction Thesis,&lt;ref&gt;See "The Logic of Relatives", The ''Monist'', Vol. 7, 1897, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pa0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA554&amp;#PPA161,M1 161]-217, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=pa0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA554&amp;#PPA183,M1 p. 183] (via Google Books with registration apparently not required). Reprinted in the ''Collected Papers'', vol. 3, paragraphs 456-552, see paragraph 483.&lt;/ref&gt; (a) triads are necessary because genuinely triadic relations cannot be completely analyzed in terms of monadic and dyadic predicates, and (b) triads are sufficient because there are no genuinely tetradic or larger polyadic relations—all higher-[[arity]] ''n''-adic relations can be analyzed in terms of triadic and lower-arity relations and are reducible to them. Peirce and others, notably Robert Burch (1991) and Joachim Hereth Correia and Reinhard Pöschel (2006), have offered proofs of the Reduction Thesis.&lt;ref&gt;* Burch, Robert (1991), ''A Peircean Reduction Thesis: The Foundations of Topological Logic'', Texas Tech University Press, Lubbock, Texas

* In 1954 [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] claimed to prove the reducibility of larger predicates to dyadic predicates, in Quine, W.V.O., "Reduction to a dyadic predicate", ''Selected Logic Papers''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peirce, a genuinely monadic predicate characteristically expresses quality. A genuinely dyadic predicate — reaction or resistance. A genuinely triadic predicate — representation or mediation. Thus Peirce's theory of relations underpins his philosophical theory of three basic categories ([[#Classes of signs|see below]]).

''Extension × intension = information.'' {{Citation needed|reason=Interpretative claim, needs backing|date=January 2018}} Two traditional approaches to sign relation, necessary though insufficient, are the way of ''[[Extension (semantics)|extension]]'' (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of ''[[intension]]'' (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, [[Comprehension (logic)|comprehension]], significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of ''[[Logic of information|information]]'', including change of information, in order to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1867), "Upon Logical Comprehension and Extension" (CP 2.391-426), (W 2:70-86, PEP [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_06/v2_06.htm Eprint]).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies. A proposition's comprehension consists in its implications.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S and Ladd-Franklin, Christine, "Signification (and Application, in logic)", ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'' v. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA528 p. 528]. Reprinted CP 2.431-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Determination.'' A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object — the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out especially when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object — the object determines the sign to determine the interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something ''as'' a sign representing an object. It is an informational kind of determination, a rendering of something more determinately representative.&lt;ref name=determined&gt;Peirce, letter to William James, dated 1909, see EP 2:492.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce used the word "determine" not in strictly deterministic sense, but in a sense of "specializes", ''bestimmt'',&lt;ref name=determined /&gt; involving variation in measure, like an influence. Peirce came to define sign, object, and interpretant by their (triadic) mode of determination, not by the idea of representation, since that is part of what is being defined.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., "A Letter to Lady Welby" (1908), ''Semiotic and Significs'', pp. 80-81: &lt;blockquote style="font-size:100%;"&gt;I define a Sign as anything which is so determined by something else, called its Object, and so determines an effect upon a person, which effect I call its Interpretant, that the latter is thereby mediately determined by the former. My insertion of "upon a person" is a sop to Cerberus, because I despair of making my own broader conception understood.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The object determines the sign to determine another sign — the interpretant — to be related to the object ''as the sign is related to the object'', hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general.&lt;ref name=Marty&gt;See "[http://perso.numericable.fr/robert.marty/semiotique/access.htm 76 definitions of the sign by C.S.Peirce]", collected by Professor Robert Marty (University of Perpignan, France).&lt;/ref&gt; In semiosis, every sign is an interpretant in a chain stretching both fore and aft. The relation of informational or logical determination which constrains object, sign, and interpretant is more general than the special cases of causal or physical determination. In general terms, any information about one of the items in the sign relation tells you something about the others, although the actual amount of this information may be nil in some species of sign relations.

===Sign, object, interpretant===

Peirce held that there are exactly three basic semiotic elements, the sign, object, and interpretant, as outlined above and fleshed out here in a bit more detail:
*A ''sign'' (or ''representamen'') represents, in the broadest possible sense of "represents". It is something interpretable as saying something about something. It is not necessarily symbolic, linguistic, or artificial.
*An ''object'' (or ''semiotic object'') is a subject matter of a sign and an interpretant. It can be anything discussable or thinkable, a thing, event, relationship, quality, law, argument, etc., and can even be fictional, for instance Hamlet.&lt;ref name=fictive&gt;A Letter to William James, EP 2:498, 1909, viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/dynamicalobject.html Dynamical Object]&lt;/ref&gt; All of those are special or partial objects. The object most accurately is the [[universe of discourse]] to which the partial or special object belongs.&lt;ref&gt;A Letter to William James, EP 2:492, 1909, viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/object.html Object]".&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a perturbation of Pluto's orbit is a sign about Pluto but ultimately not only about Pluto.
*An ''interpretant'' (or ''interpretant sign'') is the sign's more or less clarified meaning or ramification, a kind of form or idea of the difference which the sign's being true or undeceptive would make. (Peirce's sign theory concerns meaning in the broadest sense, including logical implication, not just the meanings of words as properly clarified by a dictionary.) The interpretant is a sign (a) of the object and (b) of the interpretant's "predecessor" (the interpreted sign) as being a sign of the same object. The interpretant is an ''interpretation'' in the sense of a ''product'' of an interpretive process or a ''content'' in which an interpretive relation culminates, though this product or content may itself be an act, a state of agitation, a conduct, etc. Such is what is summed up in saying that the sign stands ''for'' the object ''to'' the interpretant.

Some of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object. In order to know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object collaterally to that sign or sign system, and in this context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 404-409 in "Pragmatism", EP 2.  Ten quotes on collateral observation from Peirce provided by Joseph Ransdell can be viewed [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=57101#57101 here]. Note: Ransdell's quotes from CP 8.178-179, are also in EP 2:493-4, which gives their date as 1909; and his quote from CP 8.183, is also in EP 2:495-6, which gives its date as 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;span id=representamen&gt;"''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/representamen.html Representamen]''"&lt;/span&gt; (properly with the "a" long and stressed: {{IPAc-en|r|ɛ|p|r|ᵻ|z|ɛ|n|ˈ|t|eɪ|m|ən}}) was adopted ([[wiktionary:representamen|not coined]]) by Peirce as his blanket technical term for any and every sign or sign-like thing covered by his theory. It is a question of whether the theoretically defined "representamen" covers only the cases covered by the popular word "sign." The word "representamen" is there in case a divergence should emerge. Peirce's example was this: Sign action always involves a mind. If a sunflower, by doing nothing more than turning toward the sun, were thereby to become fully able to reproduce a sunflower turning in just the same way toward the sun, then the first sunflower's turning would be a representamen of the sun yet not a sign of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;"A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic", EP 2:272-3, 1903&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce eventually stopped using the word "representamen."&lt;ref&gt;A Draft of a Letter to Lady Welby, ''Semiotic and Significs'', p. 193, 1905&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce made various classifications of his semiotic elements, especially of the sign and the interpretant. Of particular concern in understanding the sign-object-interpretant triad is this: In relation to a sign, its object and its interpretant are either immediate (present in the sign) or mediate.
{{Ordered list|
|''Sign'', always immediate to itself — that is, in a tautologous sense, present in or at itself, even if it is not immediate to a mind or immediately accomplished without processing or is a general apprehended only in its instances.
|''Object'' {{Ordered list|list-style-type=lower-roman
|''Immediate object'', the object as represented in the sign.
|''Dynamic object'', the object as it really is, on which the idea which is the immediate object is "founded, as on bedrock"&lt;ref&gt;In EP 2:407, viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/realobject.html Real Object]"&lt;/ref&gt; Also called the dynamoid object, the dynamical object.}}
|''Interpretant'' {{Ordered list|list-style-type=lower-roman
|''Immediate interpretant'', the quality of the impression which a sign is fit to produce, not any actual reaction, and which the sign carries with it even before there is an interpreter or quasi-interpreter. It is what is ordinarily called the sign's meaning.
|''Dynamic interpretant'', the actual effect (apart from the feeling) of the sign on a mind or quasi-mind, for instance the agitation of the feeling.
|''Final interpretant'', the effect which the sign ''would'' have on the conduct of any mind or quasi-mind if circumstances allowed that effect to be fully achieved. It is the sign's end or purpose. The final interpretant of one's inquiry about the weather is the inquiry's purpose, the effect which the response would have on the plans for the day of anybody in one's shoes. The final interpretant of a line of investigation as such is the truth as the ideal final opinion and ''would'' be reached sooner or later but still inevitably by investigation adequately prolonged, though the truth remains independent of that which you or I or any finite community of investigators believe.}}
}}

The immediate object is, from the viewpoint of a theorist, really a kind of sign of the dynamic object; but phenomenologically it ''is'' the object until there is reason to go beyond it, and somebody analyzing (critically but not theoretically) a given semiosis will consider the immediate object to be ''the'' object until there is reason to do otherwise.&lt;ref name=RansdellIO&gt;See Ransdell, Joseph, "On the Use and Abuse of the Immediate/Dynamical Object Distinction" draft 2007, ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/ransdell/useabuse.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce preferred phrases like ''dynamic object'' over ''real object'' since the object might be fictive — Hamlet, for instance, to whom one grants a fictive reality, a reality within the universe of discourse of the play ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name=fictive /&gt;

It is initially tempting to regard immediate, dynamic, and final interpretants as forming a temporal succession in an actual process of semiosis, especially since their conceptions refer to beginning, midstages, and end of a semiotic process. But instead their distinctions from each other are modal or categorial. The immediate interpretant is a quality of impression which a sign is fitted to produce, a special potentiality. The dynamic interpretant is an actuality. The final interpretant is a kind of norm or necessity unaffected by actual trends of opinion or interpretation. One does not actually obtain a final interpretant per se; instead one may successfully ''coincide'' with it.&lt;ref&gt;See Peirce's 1909 letter (or letters) to William James, CP 8.314 and 8.315, and ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 496-7, and a 1909 letter to [[Victoria, Lady Welby|Lady Welby]], ''Semiotic and Significs'' pp. 110-1, all under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/finalinterpretant.html Final Interpretant]" at CDPT. Also see 1873, MS 218 (Robin 379) in ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' v. 3, p. 79, on the final opinion, and CP 8.184, on final opinion as final interpretant, in a review of a book by Lady Welby.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce, a [[fallibilism|fallibilist]], holds that one has no guarantees that one has done so, but only compelling reasons, sometimes very compelling, to think so and, in practical matters, must sometimes act with complete confidence of having done so. (Peirce said that it is often better in practical matters to rely on instinct, sentiment, and tradition, than on theoretical inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", 1898, Lecture 1 of the Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, published CP 1.616-48 in part and in ''Reasoning and the Logic of Things'', Ketner (ed., intro.) and Putnam (intro., comm.), pp. 105-22, reprinted in ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 27-41.&lt;/ref&gt;) In any case, insofar as truth is the final interpretant of a pursuit of truth, one believes, in effect, that one coincides with a final interpretant of some question about what is true, whenever and to whatever extent that one believes that one reaches a truth.

==Classes of signs&lt;!--linked from 'Rheme'--&gt;==

Peirce proposes several typologies and definitions of the signs. More than 76 definitions of what a sign is have been collected throughout Peirce's work.&lt;ref name=76defs&gt;See "76 Definitions of The Sign by C. S. Peirce" collected and analyzed by Robert Marty, Department of Mathematics, University of Perpignan, Perpignan, France, With an Appendix of 12 Further Definitions or Equivalents proposed by Alfred Lang,
Dept of Psychology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland, ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/rsources/76defs/76defs.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; Some canonical typologies can nonetheless be observed, one crucial one being the distinction between "icons", "indices" and "[[Symbol (semiotics)|symbols]]" (CP 2.228, CP 2.229 and CP 5.473). The icon-index-symbol typology is chronologically the first but structurally the second of three that fit together as a trio of three-valued parameters in regular scheme of nine kinds of sign. (The three "parameters" (not Peirce's term) are not independent of one another, and the result is a system of ten classes of sign, which are shown further down in this article.)

Peirce's three basic phenomenological [[Categories (Peirce)|categories]] come into central play in these classifications. The 1-2-3 numerations used further below in the exposition of sign classes represents Peirce's associations of sign classes with the categories. The categories are as follows:
{{C. S. Peirce categorial table}}

The three sign typologies depend respectively on (I) the sign itself, (II) how the sign stands for its denoted object, and (III) how the signs stands for its object to its interpretant. Each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomy]], via Peirce's three phenomenological categories.

# ''Qualisigns'', ''sinsigns'', and ''legisigns'' . Every sign is either (qualisign) a quality or possibility, or (sinsign) an actual individual thing, fact, event, state, etc., or (legisign) a norm, habit, rule, law. (Also called ''tones'', ''tokens'', and ''types'', also ''potisigns'', ''actisigns'', and ''famisigns''.)
# ''Icons'', ''indices'', and ''symbols''. Every sign refers either (icon) through similarity to its object, or (index) through factual connection to its object, or (symbol) through interpretive habit or norm of reference to its object.
# ''Rhemes'', ''dicisigns'', and ''arguments'' . Every sign is interpreted either as (rheme) term-like, standing for its object in respect of quality, or as (dicisign) proposition-like, standing for its object in respect of fact, or as (argument) argumentative, standing for its object in respect of habit or law. This is the trichotomy of all signs as building blocks of inference. (Also called ''sumisigns'', ''dicent signs'', and ''suadisigns'', also ''semes'', ''phemes'', and ''delomes''.)

Every sign falls under one class or another within (I) ''and'' within (II) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;' within (III). Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign. The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications aren't found.&lt;ref name=OnlyTen&gt;For the reasons why, see  CP 2.254-263, reprinted in the ''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=ClSjXRIbxAMC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;sig=ACfU3U2LRBoPVu0drFP5F5yV1_Z6sP4dfA pp. 115]-118, and in EP 2:294-296.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis.

In later years, Peirce attempted a finer level of analysis, defining sign classes in terms of relations not just to sign, object, and interpretant, but to sign, immediate object, dynamic object, immediate interpretant, dynamic interpretant, and final or normal interpretant. He aimed at 10 trichotomies of signs, with the above three trichotomies interspersed among them, and issuing in 66 classes of signs. He did not bring that system into a finished form. In any case, in that system, icon, index, and symbol were classed by category of how they stood for the dynamic object, while rheme, dicisign, and argument were classed by the category of how they stood to the final or normal interpretant.&lt;ref&gt;See CP 8.343-75, from a 1908 partial draft of a letter to Lady Welby.&lt;/ref&gt;

These conceptions are specific to Peirce's theory of signs and are not exactly equivalent to general uses of the notions of "icon", "index", "symbol", "tone", "token", "type", "term" (or "rheme"), "proposition" (or "dicisign), "argument".

===I. Qualisign, sinsign, legisign===
Also called ''tone, token, type''; and also called ''potisign, actisign, famisign''.

This is the typology of the sign as distinguished by ''sign's own'' phenomenological category (set forth in 1903, 1904, etc.).

#A ''qualisign'' (also called ''tone'', ''potisign'', and ''mark'') is a sign which consists in a quality of feeling, a possibility, a "First."
#A ''sinsign'' (also called ''token'' and ''actisign'') is a sign which consists in a reaction/resistance, an actual singular thing, an actual occurrence or fact, a "Second."
#A ''legisign'' (also called ''type'' and ''famisign'') is a sign which consists in a (general) idea, a norm or law or habit, a representational relation, a "Third."

A ''replica'' (also called ''instance'') of a legisign is a sign, often an actual individual one (a sinsign), which embodies that legisign. A replica is a sign for the associated legisign, and therefore is also a sign for the legisign's object. All legisigns need sinsigns as replicas, for expression. Some but not all legisigns are symbols. All symbols are legisigns. Different words with the same meaning are symbols which are replicas of that symbol which consists in their meaning but doesn't prescribe qualities of its replicas.&lt;ref name=replicasymbol&gt;"New Elements (Kaina Stoicheia") MS 517 (1904); EP 2:300-324, ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/stoicheia/stoicheia.htm Eprint], scroll down to /317/, then first new paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

===II. Icon, index, symbol===
This is the typology of the sign as distinguished by phenomenological category of its way of denoting the ''object'' (set forth in 1867 and many times in later years). This typology emphasizes the different ways in which the sign refers to its object — the icon by a quality of its own, the index by real connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant. The modes may be compounded, for instance, in a sign that displays a forking line iconically for a fork in the road and stands indicatively near a fork in the road.

#An ''icon'' (also called ''likeness'' and ''semblance'') is a sign that denotes its object by virtue of a quality which is shared by them but which the icon has irrespectively of the object. The icon (for instance, a portrait or a diagram) ''resembles or imitates'' its object. The icon has, of itself, a certain character or aspect, one which the object also has (or is supposed to have) and which lets the icon be interpreted as a sign even if the object does not exist. The icon signifies essentially on the basis of its "ground." (Peirce defined the ground as the pure abstraction of a quality, and the sign's ground as the pure abstraction of the quality in ''respect'' of which the sign refers to its object, whether by resemblance or, as a symbol, by imputing the quality to the object.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the Scholastic conception of a relation's foundation, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fSzt6_-ce-gC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22Introducing+Semiotic%22+foundation+ground&amp;sig=kgh62kOzOoFrCOYyAV04YxJ0SOo#PPA61,M1 Deely 1982, p. 61] (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;). Peirce called an icon apart from a label, legend, or other index attached to it, a "hypoicon", and divided the hypoicon into three classes: (a) the ''image'', which depends on a simple quality; (b) the ''diagram'', whose internal relations, mainly dyadic or so taken, represent by analogy the relations in something; and (c) the ''metaphor'', which represents the representative character of a sign by representing a parallelism in something else.&lt;ref&gt;On image, diagram, and metaphor, see "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/hypoicon.html Hypoicon]" in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A diagram can be geometric, or can consist in an array of algebraic expressions, or even in the common form "All __ is ___" which is subjectable, like any diagram, to logical or mathematical transformations. Peirce held that mathematics is done by diagrammatic thinking — observation of, and experimentation on, diagrams.
#An ''index''&lt;span title="Note appears directly after the current 3 paragraphs on icon, index, and symbol"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; is a sign that denotes its object by virtue of an ''actual connection'' involving them, one that he also calls a ''real relation'' in virtue of its being irrespective of interpretation. It is in any case a relation which is ''in fact'', in contrast to the icon, which has only a ''ground'' for denotation of its object, and in contrast to the symbol, which denotes by an interpretive ''habit or law''. An index which compels attention without conveying any information about its object is a ''pure'' index, though that may be an ideal limit never actually reached. If an indexical relation is a resistance or reaction physically or causally connecting an index to its object, then the index is a ''reagent'' (for example smoke coming from a building is a reagent index of fire). Such an index is really affected or modified by the object, and is the only kind of index which can be used in order to ascertain facts about its object. Peirce also usually held that an index does not have to be an actual individual fact or thing, but can be a general; a disease symptom is general, its occurrence singular; and he usually considered a ''designation'' to be an index, e.g., a pronoun, a proper name, a label on a diagram, etc. (In 1903 Peirce said that only an individual is an index,&lt;ref name=index&gt;In 'A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic', EP 2:274, 1903, and viewable under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/index2.html Index]" at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT].&lt;/ref&gt; gave "seme" as an alternate expression for "index", and called designations "subindices or hyposemes,&lt;ref&gt;In "A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic", EP 2:274, 1903, and viewable under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/subindex.html Subindex, Hyposeme]" at the [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT].&lt;/ref&gt; which were a kind of symbol; he allowed of a "degenerate index" indicating a non-individual object, as exemplified by an individual thing indicating its own characteristics. But by 1904 he allowed indices to be generals and returned to classing designations as indices. In 1906 he changed the meaning of "seme" to that of the [[#III. Rheme.2C dicisign.2C argument|earlier "sumisign" and "rheme"]].)
#A ''symbol''&lt;span title="Note appears directly after the current 3 paragraphs on icon, index, and symbol"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; is a sign that denotes its object solely by virtue of the fact that it will be interpreted to do so. The symbol consists in a natural or conventional or logical rule, norm, or habit, a habit that lacks (or has shed) dependence on the symbolic sign's having a resemblance or real connection to the denoted object. Thus, a symbol denotes by virtue of its interpretant. Its sign-action (semeiosis) is ruled by a habit, a more or less systematic set of associations that ensures its interpretation. For Peirce, every symbol is a general, and that which we call an actual individual symbol (e.g., on the page) is called by Peirce a ''replica'' or ''instance'' of the symbol. Symbols, like all other legisigns (also called "types"), need actual, individual replicas for expression. The ''proposition'' is an example of a symbol which is irrespective of language and of any form of expression and does not prescribe qualities of its replicas.&lt;ref name=proposition&gt;MS599 c.1902 "Reason's Rules", relevant quote viewable under "MS 599" in "Role of Icons In Predication", Joseph Ransdell, ed. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/rsources/quotes/iconrole.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; A ''word'' that is symbolic (rather than indexical like "this" or iconic like "whoosh!") is an example of a symbol that prescribes qualities (especially looks or sound) of its replicas.&lt;ref name="words"&gt;"A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic", EP 2:274, 1903, and "Logical Tracts, No. 2", CP 4.447, c. 1903. Relevant quotes viewable at the [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT], under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/symbol.html "Symbol"].&lt;/ref&gt; Not every replica is actual and individual. Two word-symbols with the same meaning (such as English "horse" and Spanish ''{{lang|es|caballo}}'') are symbols which are replicas of that symbol which consists in their shared meaning.&lt;ref name="replicasymbol" /&gt; A book, a theory, a person, each is a complex symbol.

&lt;span id="sign_note"&gt;&amp;nbsp;* ''Note:''&lt;/span&gt; in "On a New List of Categories" (1867) Peirce gave the unqualified term "sign" as an alternate expression for "index", and gave "general sign" as an alternate expression for "symbol". [[#representamen|"Representamen"]] was his blanket technical term for any and every sign or signlike thing covered by his theory.&lt;ref name=representamen&gt;"A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic", EP 2:272-3. Relevant quote viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT], under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/representamen.html "Representamen"]&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce soon reserved "sign" to its broadest sense, for index, icon, and symbol alike. He also eventually decided that the symbol is not the only sign which can be called a "general sign" in some sense, and that indices and icons can be generals, generalities, too. The general sign, as such, the generality as a sign, he eventually called, at various times, the "legisign" (1903, 1904), the "type" (1906, 1908), and the "famisign" (1908)&lt;span title="End of note"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

===III. Rheme, dicisign, argument===

This is the typology of the sign as distinguished by the phenomenological category which the sign's  interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting the object (set forth in 1902, 1903, etc.):

#A ''rheme'' (also called ''sumisign'' and ''seme''&lt;span title="Note appears directly after the current 3 paragraphs on rheme, dicisign, and argument"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;) is a sign that represents its object in respect of quality and so, in its signified interpretant, is represented as a character or mark,&lt;ref&gt;A Letter to Lady Welby, ''Semiotic and Significs'' pp. 33-34, 1904, viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/rhema.html "Rhema, Rheme"].&lt;/ref&gt; though it actually may be icon, index, or symbol. The rheme&lt;span title="Note appears directly after the current 3 paragraphs on rheme, dicisign, and argument"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; (seme) stands as its object for some purpose.&lt;ref name=induce&gt;Peirce, 1906, "Prolegomena To an Apology For Pragmaticism", pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA506 506]-507 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA492 492]-546, ''The Monist'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA479 v. XVI, n. 4] (mislabeled "VI"), Oct. 1906, reprinted in CP 4.538&lt;/ref&gt; A proposition with the subject places left blank is a rheme; but subject terms by themselves are also rhemes. A proposition, said Peirce, can be considered a zero-place rheme, a zero-place predicate.
#A ''dicisign'' (also called ''dicent sign'' and ''pheme'' ) is a sign that represents its object in respect of actual existence and so, in its signified interpretant, is represented as indexical,&lt;ref&gt;A Letter to Lady Welby, ''Semiotic and Significs'', pp. 33-34, 1904; also "A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic', EP 2:275-276 and 292, 1903; all three quotes viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/dicent.html Dicent, Dicent Sign, Dicisign]".&lt;/ref&gt; though it actually may be either index or symbol. The dicisign separately indicates its object (as subject of the predicate).&lt;ref name=separately&gt;"New Elements (Kaina Stoicheia)", Manuscript 517 (1904), and EP 2:300-324, see 308, viewable in ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/stoicheia/stoicheia.htm Eprint], scroll down to /308/&lt;/ref&gt; The dicisign "is intended to have some compulsive effect on the interpreter of it".&lt;ref name=induce /&gt; Peirce had generalized the idea of proposition to where a weathercock, photograph, etc., could be considered propositions (or "dicisigns", as he came to call them). A proposition in the conventional sense is a dicent symbol (also called symbolic dicisign). Assertions are also dicisigns.
#An ''argument'' (also called ''suadisign'' and ''delome'') is a sign that represents its object in respect of law or habit and so, in its signified interpretant, is represented as symbolic (and was indeed a symbol in the first place).&lt;ref&gt;"A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic", EP 2:296, 1903, quote viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/argument.html Argument]".&lt;/ref&gt; The argument separately "monstrates" its signified interpretant (the argument's conclusion); an argument stripped of all signs of such monstrative relationship is, or becomes, a dicisign.&lt;ref name=separately /&gt; It represents "a process of change in thoughts or signs, as if to induce this change in the Interpreter" through the interpreter's own self-control.&lt;ref name=induce /&gt; A novel, a work of art, the universe, can be a delome in Peirce's terms.

&amp;nbsp;*''Note:'' In his "Prolegomena To an Apology For Pragmaticism" (The ''Monist'', v. XVI, no. 4, Oct. 1906), Peirce uses the words "seme", "pheme", and "delome" (pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA506 506], 507, etc.) for the rheme-dicisign-argument typology, but retains the word "rheme" for the predicate ([https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA530 p. 530]) in his system of Existential Graphs. Also note that Peirce once offered "seme" as an alternate expression for "index" in 1903.&lt;ref name=index /&gt;

===The three sign typologies together: ten classes of sign===
The three typologies, labeled "I.", "II.", and "III.",  are shown together in the table below. As parameters, they are not independent of one another. As previously said, many co-classifications aren't found.&lt;ref name="OnlyTen" /&gt; The slanting and vertical lines show the options for co-classification of a given sign (and appear in MS 339, August 7, 1904, viewable [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/attachment/220287/2-2/moz-screenshot-1.jpg here] at the Lyris peirce-l archive&lt;ref&gt;the image was provided by [http://www.iutc3.unicaen.fr/~moranb/ Bernard Morand] of the Institut Universitaire de Technologie (France), D&amp;#233;partement Informatique.&lt;/ref&gt;). The result is ten classes of sign.

Words in parentheses in the table are alternate names for the same kinds of signs. &lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: THE TITLES IN THIS TABLE ARE ESPECIALLY FOR SCREEN READERS --&gt;

&amp;nbsp;*''Note:'' As noted above, in "On a New List of Categories" (1867) Peirce gave the unqualified word "sign" as an alternate expression for "index", and gave "general sign" as an alternate expression for "symbol." Peirce soon reserved "sign" to its broadest sense, for index, icon, and symbol alike, and eventually decided that symbols are not the only signs which can be called "general signs" in some sense. See [[#sign note|note]] at end of section "II. Icon, index, symbol" for details.&lt;br&gt;
Note that a term (in the conventional sense) is not just any rheme; it is a kind of rhematic symbol. Likewise a proposition (in the conventional sense) is not just any dicisign, it is a kind of dicent symbol.

“'''Sensory Room'''” is an [[umbrella term]] used to categorize a broad variety of therapeutic spaces specifically designed and utilized to promote [[self-organization]] and positive change. There are multiple types of sensory rooms and purposes for use that have been created and implemented in different practice areas to date. When used appropriately, sensory rooms: 
*Help to create a [[safe space]]
*Facilitate the [[therapeutic alliance]]
*Provide opportunities for engagement in prevention and crisis de-escalation strategies, as well as a host of other therapeutic exchanges (to teach skills, offer a variety of therapeutic activities, etc.) 
*Promote self-care/self-nurturance, resilience &amp; recovery &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ot-innovations.com/content/view/49/46/&lt;/ref&gt;

Multi-sensory equipment is a vital and effective part in the treatment of [[Sensory processing disorder|sensory disorders]] with children and adults alike.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.altogetherautism.org.nz/multi-sensory-environments-use-people-autism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensory equipment can help [[Child development|develop key life skills]] including [[Language development|vocalization]], [[gross motor skill|gross motor skills]], color recognition and tracking. Examples include sensory rooms, sensory pools, sensory bathrooms and sensory gardens.

They are also sometimes called "multi sensory room", "white room", or "quiet room".&lt;ref name="sydney-manual"&gt;http://sydney.edu.au/health_sciences/speech_pathology/resources/docs/MSR_Manual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
TMTC is housed in a gracious heritage structure, designed by renowned architect [[George Wittet]], on rambling grounds surrounded by leafy trees, lawns, pathways and flower beds. The 15 acres of land on which TMTC stands once belonged to leading solicitor F. E. Dinshaw. In 1918, Mr. Dinshaw acquired the services of Mr. Wittet, the then consulting architect to the Government of Bombay, to build him a country home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the 1960s, it was restored and turned it into a residential training centre though the original layout remains the same.
The institute can house 60 people at its residential facilities, with two lecture halls and two seminar rooms. It also has a library of management books, journals and films. Along with its facilities for training and living, TMTC has facilities for indoor and outdoor sports.

Its facilities have been utilised by other specialised training institutes, including the [[Indian Institutes of Management]] (Ahmedabad and Calcutta), the [[Administrative Staff College of India]](Hyderabad), the All India Management Association and the Indian Society for Applied Behavioural Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''transparency report''' is a statement issued on a regular basis by a [[company]], disclosing a variety of [[statistics]] related to requests for user [[data]], records, or content. Transparency reports generally disclose how frequently and under what authority [[government]]s have requested or demanded data or records over a certain period of time. This form of [[corporate transparency]] allows the public to discern what private information governments have gained access to through [[search warrant]]s and court [[subpoena]]s, among other methods. Some transparency reports describe how often, as a result of government action or under [[copyright]] provisions, content was removed. Disclosing a transparency report also helps people to know about the appropriate scope and authority of content regulation for online discussions.&lt;ref name=Google&gt;{{cite web|title=transparency report introduction|url=https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Google]] first launched a transparency report in 2010, with Twitter following in 2012. Additional companies began releasing transparency reports as during the aftermath of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures beginning in 2013]], and the number of companies issuing them has increased rapidly ever since. Transparency reports are issued today by a variety of technology and communications companies, including [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Verizon]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[Twitter]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Facebook]], [[Yahoo]] and [[CloudFlare]]. Several companies and advocacy groups have lobbied the [[U.S. government]] to allow the number of secret data requests (requests which include a [[gag order]]s - including [[National Security Letter]]s) to be described within ranges in the report. 

==Government demand increases in years==

===Google===
[[Google Search|Google's]] latest ''(10th)'' transparency report indicates that the government demands for data are increasing in recent years.This report shows demands from government in the first six months of 2014, and the firm said that it includes demands made under the US Foreign Intelligence, Surveillance Act (FISA) and through National Security Letters (NSLs).
"FISA and NSL demands have increased by 15 percent during the six months, according to the firm, and by 150 percent over the 10 reports and the five year reporting period. That's globally. In the US the figures for the same period are 19 percent and 250 percent."
[[Google]] legal director ''Richard Salgado'' accepted that the government has to fight crime and deal with threats, but the opposition of data demands need to be considered as well.
''"This increase in government demands comes against a backdrop of ongoing revelations about government surveillance programs. Despite these revelations, we have seen some countries expand their surveillance authorities in an attempt to reach service providers outside their borders,"'' he said.
''"Governments have a legitimate and important role in fighting crime and investigating national security threats. To maintain public confidence in both government and technology, we need legislative reform that ensures surveillance powers are transparent, reasonably scoped by law, and subject to independent oversight."''
The report shows that the US makes the most demands for Google users' data, and Google said that it made 12,539 requests that affected some 22,000 accounts. It added that it provided data in 84 percent of cases.

In the UK it said there were 1,535 requests covering 1,991 users or accounts, and [[Google]] provided data for 72 percent of the requests.&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dave|first1=Neal|title=Google’s 10th transparency report shows government requests are rising|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2369323/google-s-10th-transparency-report-shows-government-requests-are-rising|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yahoo===
The latest Yahoo transparency report was released on 25 September 2014. The report states that 30,511 users were affected by 18,594 government data requests.,whereas 57,324 accounts were affected by 29,470 government requests.&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo Government data request|url=https://transparency.yahoo.com/government-data-requests/index.htm|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both of these figures do not include those secret requests sent by the FISA court. During the last six month from ''July 1, 2013, to December 31, 2013'', it received between 0 and 1998 FISA requests for user data, affecting up to 54,997 users (including national security letters). Comparing to the first sixth month from ''January 1, 2013 to June 30, 2013'', 32,997 accounts was affected. As we can see from the figures, although the total number of data request drop, the number of data request approved from the FISA court have increased significantly.
Overall, 41 percent of accounts affected by government data requests came from requests made by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo Data requests drop, but FISA stats are worrying|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/25/yahoo-transparency-report-over-30k-government-data-requests-nearly-half-from-the-u-s/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Transparency reports may be published for a variety of purposes. One purpose could be to clarify how much information governments ask for, how such requests are evaluated, and how the receiving entity chose to respond. This information may lead consumers to the conclusion that the report's publisher is more trustworthy.&lt;ref name=argument&gt;{{cite web|title=Transparency reports useful, but more info needed on 'digital searches'|url=http://www.scmagazine.com/transparency-reports-useful-but-more-info-needed-on-digital-searches/article/376751/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is some debate about what transparency reports really reveal. Some critics argue that mere quantities of requests may mislead consumers, since most entities have little control over the number of requests they receive, the breadth of the requests they receive, or even the number of requests they ultimately comply with.&lt;ref name="transparency report"&gt;{{cite web|title=what transparency report don't tell us?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-transparency-reports-dont-tell-us/282529/#disqus_thread|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies such as [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]] all release transparency reports, all of which list the type and number of government data requests each company receives. these reports include exact numbers and shed a bright light on government activity. The U.S. government will not, however, permit companies to report exact numbers for national security requests or the number of requests that came under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Section 702, Patriot Act Section 215, or national security letters.
Instead, they have to aggregate the numbers or provide a range. And that’s even if the government permits a company to publish that data. Google may publish national security letter information, but not FISA information. Facebook may publish FISA information, but it must lump such data in with NSL information. As a result, consumers cannot see the true figure for total government data requests.
Critics of this policy, such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], argue that there is no clear national security justification for blocking entities from releasing this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the transparency report is necessary in the fight for privacy|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/09/12/transparency-reports/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicts between government and company==

In June 2013, [[Google]] asked the Department of Justice for permission to disclose details about the number of FISA requests it receives. As a result, [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], and [[Facebook]] followed suit immediately. However, the Department of Justice refused those requests, and they only provide the companies with a heavily redacted version of their arguments.
Here's what Google legal director Richard Salgado had to say about FISA requests:
''"We want to go even further. We believe it’s your right to know what kinds of requests and how many each government is making of us and other companies. However, the U.S. Department of Justice contends that U.S. law does not allow us to share information about some national security requests that we might receive.

On 7 October 2014, [[Twitter]] announce that there will be a lawsuit against the United States government for violating its First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Transparency Report which would reveal how many national security letters (NSLs) and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) orders [[Twitter]] receives. They provided a draft of the transparency report to the Department of Justice and discussed it for months. [[Twitter]] was still unable to get the permission for allowing them to publish even a redacted version of the report from the government.
The response form FBI for its stance is that the information Twitter wants to publish "is classified and cannot be publicly released", they also said according to the framework provided on 27 January 2014, Twitter is only permitted to qualify its description of the total number of accounts affected by all national security legal process it has received but it cannot quantify that description with specific detail that goes well beyond what is allowed under the 27th Jan 2014 framework and that discloses properly classified information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI response|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/07/National-Security/Graphics/Exhibit%205%20-%2020140909%20FBI%20Letter%20to%20Twitter.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

===About the government===
The United States government announced on 30 August 2013 that a transparency report which is in its own form will be released. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper announced the change on his office's [[Tumblr]] blog. He said that the decision will come naturally after President Barack Obama ordered the declassification of as much intelligence information as possible. Total numbers for national security letters, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) business records requests, FISA one register/trap and trace requests will be stated in the transparency report. Beside that, the report will also include the number of targets being investigated in each of these requests. The number will reflect the 12 months prior to the date published.
The inspiration of the report comes from the recent surveillance program leaks from former NSA-contractor Edward Snowden, according to an anonymous source speaking with the ''Washington Post''.
[[Google]], [[Twitter]],and [[Facebook]] all release their own forms of transparency report, however they are not allowed to release this sort of information in their report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Meghan Kelly|title=U.S. to release transparency report with FISA and national security requests|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/08/30/us-transparency-report/|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kette Kettenkurve Catenary 2008 PD.JPG|right|350px|thumb|A hanging [[chain]] is a regular [[catenary]] &amp;mdash; and is not weighted.]]

A '''weighted catenary''' is a [[catenary]] curve, but of a special form. A "regular" catenary has the equation

:&lt;math&gt;y = a \, \cosh \left(\frac{x}{a}\right) = \frac{a\left(e^\frac{x}{a} + e^{-\frac{x}{a}}\right)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

for a given value of ''a''. A ''weighted catenary'' has the equation

:&lt;math&gt;y = b \, \cosh \left(\frac{x}{a}\right) = \frac{b\left(e^\frac{x}{a} + e^{-\frac{x}{a}}\right)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and now ''two'' constants enter: ''a'' and ''b''.

==Why they are important==

A [[catenary arch]] has a uniform thickness. However, if

# the arch is not of uniform thickness,&lt;ref name="http://www.ams.org/notices/201002/rtx100200220p.pdf"&gt;{{cite web | title=Mathematics of the Gateway Arch | publisher=Notices of the AMS | work=Mathematics of the Gateway Arch | date=February 2010 | author=Robert Osserman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# the arch supports more than its own weight,&lt;ref name="blogspot.co.uk"&gt;Re-review: Catenary and Parabola: [http://arch-re-review.blogspot.co.uk/2010/09/catenary-and-parabola.html Re-review: Catenary and Parabola], accessdate: April 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;],
# or if gravity varies,&lt;ref name="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/29247/catenary-curve-under-non-uniform-gravitational-field"&gt;MathOverflow: [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/29247/catenary-curve-under-non-uniform-gravitational-field classical mechanics - Catenary curve under non-uniform gravitational field - MathOverflow], accessdate: April 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

it becomes more complex. A weighted catenary is needed.

Note that "[[aspect ratio]]" is important, which see,&lt;ref name="techtarget.com"&gt;Definition from WhatIs.com: [http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/aspect-ratio What is aspect ratio? - Definition from WhatIs.com], accessdate: April 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="How the Gateway Arch Got its Shape"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.msri.org/people/staff/osserman/papers/NNJ_v12n2_Osserman_pp167-189.pdf | title=How the Gateway Arch Got its Shape | publisher=Nexus Network Journal | work=How the Gateway Arch Got its Shape | date=2010 | accessdate=13 April 2017 | author=Robert Osserman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

The [[Gateway Arch]] in the American city of [[St. Louis]] ([[Missouri]]) is the most famous example of a weighted catenary.

[[Simple suspension bridge]]s use weighted catenaries.&lt;ref name="How the Gateway Arch Got its Shape" /&gt;

[[File:The New Testament in the original Greek - 1881.djvu|thumb|page=9]]
'''''The New Testament in the Original Greek''''' is a Greek-language version of the [[New Testament]] published in 1881. It is also known as the '''Westcott and Hort''' text, after its editors [[Brooke Foss Westcott]] (1825–1901) and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]] (1828–1892). (Textual scholars use the abbreviation "'''WH'''".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;)
It is a [[Textual criticism|critical text]], compiled from some of the oldest New Testament fragments and texts that had been discovered at the time. The two editors worked together for 28 years.

Westcott and Hort state: "[It is] our belief that even among the numerous unquestionably spurious readings of the New Testament there are no signs of deliberate falsification of the text for dogmatic purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Foss Westcott, Fenton John Anthony Hort, '[https://books.google.com/books?id=0xtVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=ACfU3U33CMW3331Vv20NgGvjyOs52I1mlA&amp;vq=%22will+not+be+out+of+place+to+add+here+a+distinct+expression+of+our+belief+that+even+among+the+numerous%22&amp;source=gbs_quotes_r&amp;cad=2_0#PPA283,M1 'The New Testament in the Original Greek: Introduction, Appendix''], p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; 
They find that without orthographic differences, doubtful textual variants exist only in one sixtieth of the whole New Testament (with most of them being comparatively trivial variations), with the substantial variations forming hardly more than one thousandth of the entire text.

According to Hort, "Knowledge of Documents should precede Final Judgments upon Readings". The two editors favoured two manuscripts: [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus|Sinaiticus]]. They also believed that the combination of [[Codex Bezae]] with the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] and the [[Peshitta|Old Syriac]] represents the original form of the New Testament text, especially when it is shorter than other forms of the text, such as the majority of the [[Byzantine text-type]].&lt;ref name = Aland&gt;{{Cite book | last = Aland | first = Kurt | authorlink = Kurt Aland |author2=[[Barbara Aland]] |translator=Erroll F.

Eerdmans Publishing Company|Wm. B. Eerdmans]] | year = 1995 | location = Grand Rapids | page = 236}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In this they followed one of the primary principles of their fledgling textual criticism, ''[[lectio brevior]]'', sometimes taken to an extreme, as in the theory of [[Western non-interpolations]], which has since been rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Aland, Kurt and Barbara.

== WH edition ==
[[File:Wyh.jpg|thumb|[[Brooke Foss Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]]]]

Westcott and Hort distinguished four text types in their studies. The most recent is the Syrian, or [[Byzantine text-type]] (eastern), of which the newest example is the [[Textus Receptus]] and thus from the critical text view is less likely reliable. The [[Western text-type]] is much older, but tends to paraphrase, so according to the critical text view also lacks dependability. The [[Alexandrian text-type]], exemplified in the [[Codex Ephraemi]], exhibits a polished Greek style. The two scholars identified their favorite text type as "Neutral text", exemplified by two 4th-century manuscripts, the [[Codex Vaticanus]] (known to scholars since the 15th century), and the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] (discovered in 1859), both of which they relied on heavily (albeit not exclusively) for this edition. This text has only a few changes of the original.&lt;ref name = Schumacher&gt;H. Schumacher, A Handbook of Scripture Study (B. Herder Book Co.: St. Louis-London 1923), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This edition is based on the critical works especially of Tischendorf and Tregelles.&lt;ref name = Schumacher/&gt; The minuscules play a minimal role in this edition.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Holmes, ''From Nestle to the `Editio Critica Maior`'', in: ''The Bible as Book: The Transmission of the Greek Text'', London 2003, p. 128. {{ISBN|0-7123-4727-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westcott and Hort worked on their Testament from 1853 until its completion in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Metzger |first1=Bruce M. |authorlink1=Bruce M.

In 1892, a revised edition was released by [[Francis Crawford Burkitt|F. C. Burkitt]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Reception ==

The edition of Westcott and Hort began a new epoch in the history of textual criticism.&lt;ref name = Schumacher/&gt; Most critical editions published after Westcott and Hort share their preference of the Alexandrian text-type and therefore are similar to ''The New Testament in the Original Greek''. An exception is the text edited by [[Hermann von Soden]]. Soden's edition stands much closer to the text of [[Constantin von Tischendorf|Tischendorf]] than to the text of Westcott and Hort. All editions of [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-Aland]] remain close in textual character to the text WH. [[Kurt Aland|Aland]] reports that, while NA25 text shows, for example, 2,047 differences from von Soden, 1,996 from Vogels, 1,268 from Tischendorf, 1,161 from Bover, and 770 from Merk, it contains only 558 differences from WH text.&lt;ref&gt;K. Aland &amp; B. Aland, ''Text of the New Testament'', pp. 26-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bruce M. Metzger]], "the general validity of their critical principles and procedures is widely acknowledged by scholars today."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1981 Metzger said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“The international committee that produced the ''United Bible Societies'' Greek New Testament, not only adopted the Westcott and Hort edition as its basic text, but followed their methodology in giving attention to both external and internal consideration”.&lt;ref&gt;B. M. Metzger, cited by James Brooks, ''Bible Interpreters of the 20th century'', p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Philip Comfort]] gave this opinion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The text produced by Westcott and Hort is still to this day, even with so many more manuscript discoveries, a very close reproduction of the primitive text of the New Testament. Of course, I think they gave too much weight to Codex Vaticanus alone, and this needs to be tempered. This criticism aside, the Westcott and Hort text is extremely reliable. (...) In many instances where I would disagree with the wording in the Nestle / UBS text in favor of a particular variant reading, I would later check with the Westcott and Hort text and realize that they had often come to the same decision. (...) Of course, the manuscript discoveries of the past one hundred years have changed things, but it is remarkable how often they have affirmed the decisions of Westcott and Hort.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Comfort, ''Encountering the Manuscripts: An Introduction to New Testament Paleography &amp; Textual Criticism'', (Nashville, 2005), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Other editions of Greek New Testament ==

The texts of [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-Aland]], and of Bover and Merk, differ very little from the text of the Westcott-Hort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/TextTypes.html#Use Robert Waltz]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilhelm (William) Dittenberger''' (August 31, 1840 in [[Heidelberg]] – December 29, 1906 in [[Halle (Saale)]]) was a German [[philologist]] in classical epigraphy.

==Life==
Wilhelm Dittenberger was the son of the Protestant theologian [[Wilhelm Theophor Dittenberger]]. After attending school in [[Heidelberg]] and [[Weimar]] (then directed by [[Hermann Sauppe]]), he studied classical philology at Jena from 1859 and transferred to [[Göttingen]] in 1861, where he was reunited with Hermann Sauppe and received his doctorate at the beginning of 1863 for a work on the Athenian [[ephebes]]. From autumn of that year, he taught at the Göttingen Gymnasium while he completed his [[habilitation]] on [[Sallust]] at the [[University of Göttingen]]. Initially, Dittenberger remained a schoolteacher, becoming a teacher at the Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium in [[Berlin]] in 1865, at the [[Rudolstadt]] Gymnasium from 1867, and at the gymnasium in [[Quedlinburg]] from 1873 to 1874. In 1874 he was appointed Professor of Classical Philology at the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]]. He was a corresponding member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] and an ordinary member of the [[German Archaeological Institute]].

Dittenberger's research focus was Greek epigraphy. His name is associated above all with the edited collections ''Sylloge Inscriptionum Graecarum'' (later re-edited by [[Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen]]) and ''Orientis Graeci Inscriptiones Selectae''. For ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'', Dittenberger was responsible for the Athenian inscriptions of the Roman period, of [[Megaris]] and [[Boeotia]], and of [[Phocis]], [[Lokris]], [[Aetolia]], [[Acarnania]] and the [[Ionian Islands]]. In addition he edited the inscriptions of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] (with [[Karl Purgold]]) and the 6th to 11th editions of the widely used commentary on [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' begun by [[Friedrich Kraner]].

His son, Heinrich Dittenberger (1875–1952), was a lawyer in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], [[Leipzig]], and [[Berlin]], as well as Chief Director of the [[German Bar Association]] from 1910 to 1933.&lt;ref&gt;''Kürschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender.'' Vol. 7, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death in 1907, his library was acquired by the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], as was the library of [[Johannes Vahlen]], slightly later (1913). Together, the two libraries form the ''Dittenberger-Vahlen Collectionn of Classical Texts'', containing over 15,000 books and 17,000 reprints. In 2000, the university began the digitisation of this collection with the assistance of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].

Dittenberger's tomb is located in the Nordfriedhof in Halle.

'''William Pulteney Alison''' &lt;small&gt;[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] [[FRCPE]] [[FSA (Scot)|FSA]]&lt;/small&gt; (12 November 1790 – 22 September 1859) was a Scottish physician, social reformer and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]]. He was a distinguished professor of medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He served as president of the [[Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh]] (1833), president of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] (1836–38), and vice-president of the [[British Medical Association]], convening its meeting in Edinburgh in 1858.

==Life==
Alison was born in [[Boroughmuirhead]] on 12 November 1790, eldest son of Dorothea Gregory and [[Archibald Alison (author)|Reverend Archibald Alison]], the elder brother of the advocate [[Archibald Alison (advocate)|Archibald Alison]]; and godson of [[Laura Pulteney, 1st Countess of Bath]]. In his youth he climbed [[Mont Blanc]] and other mountains as a pastime. He entered the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1803, and studied under his father's friend [[Dugald Stewart]], and for a time was expected to follow a career in philosophy rather than medicine. In 1811 he graduated as a physician.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1814 he opened the New Town Dispensary at 4 East James Street, at the east end of the city's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digital.nls.uk/83400219|title=Edinburgh Post Office annual directory, 1832-1833|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|page=52|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His academic career was impressive. He became a Professor of Medical Jurisprudence in 1820. From 1822 to 1842 he lectured in the Institutes of Medicine. From 1842 to 1856 he lectured in the Theory of Physic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He was President of the Royal College of Physicians 1836-8, a [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries]], President of the Medico-Chirurgical Society in 1833, and Vice President of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] 1842-59.

His uncle was [[Professor James Gregory]] and his cousin was [[Professor William Gregory]].

==Ameliorating the lot of the poor==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}

Struck by the poverty he encountered, Alison advocated poor relief in Scotland be extended from the sick and infirm to include the healthy impoverished. This was a radical suggestion as the ethos of the age was for poor relief to be withheld from the able-bodied destitute who were presumed to be indolent and sinful.

Published in his report on the generation of fever in Edwin Chadwick’s “Report on the sanitary condition of the laboring population,” despite the general feeling of many physicians at the time, Alison was of the opinion that malarias, or diseases, were not a result of putrescent animal and vegetable matters or human excretions, as many medical professionals believed, but rather was convinced that some diseases were “nearly beyond the power of medicine, but the causes of which are known, and under certain circumstances may be avoided; and the conditions necessary for avoiding them are in a great measure in the power of communities, though beyond the power of many of the individuals composing them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/350|title=William Alison|website=www.oxforddnb.com|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

Alison proposed using the [[Scottish Poor Law]] to alleviate poverty as a means of assuaging disease, but the Poor Law Commissioners supported the position of English reformer [[Edwin Chadwick]] that disease was caused by filth and miasmas. Alison held to the contagion theory of disease, stating its spread was facilitated through poverty and overcrowding. He argued that poverty arose from social factors, not sin and sloth, and that higher wages should be paid to workers to mitigate disease by reducing the effect of overcrowding and destitution. In stating a case for fighting disease that appeared to be outside the province of contemporary medicine Alison was a pioneer of "political" medicine, as well as social epidemiology and public health.

In his 1840 publication ''Observations on the management of the poor in Scotland and its effect on the health in the great towns'', Alison argued that the government and its agencies had a major role in the alleviation of poverty and that this undertaking should not be left to religious groups or private charities. He advocated using public taxes to assist widows, orphans and the unemployed poor, and criticised the establishment for ignoring those who were fit but impoverished. The findings of the 1844 Royal Commission on Poor Laws (Scotland) lent support to Alison's viewpoint. Alison was very critical of the Scottish upper class for not providing what Alison believed to be adequate relief to the impoverished citizens of the country, while praising the English system, which had a long-established legislative framework to maintain minimum standards of relief for those suffering from poverty. Contrary to England’s governmental standards, Scotland’s system was based around voluntary charity by the wealthier members of society, justified by claiming that legal guarantees of support and relief for the impoverished would remove any motivation for the poor to work out of their situation and would rather create an incentive to stay stagnant as poor in order to receive governmental benefits. Alison counter argued, saying that it was unrelieved poverty that truly lowered the morality of the poor, and not providing any relief not only made the impoverished more prone to contract disease, but also more short-sighted and reckless. There was also no evidence in Alison’s mind that the English system of governmental relief had brought any of the negative consequences that the Scottish had attributed to it, and rather “the English people receive a temporal reward for their more humane and merciful management of the poor, in the comparative exemption of most of their great towns from the curse of contagious fever.”

Alison also promoted preventive social medicine and initiated a program to vaccinate children against smallpox, and he established Edinburgh's Fever Board to combat epidemics. He advocated speedy diagnosis of the ill and, where found to be contagious or infectious, he recommended fumigation and ventilation of the residence and prompt hospitalisation for the patient. His methods bore fruit during the cholera epidemic of 1831–1832, whereby Edinburgh took immediate and effective action to mitigate the outbreak without awaiting instructions from London.

In strongly advocating government intervention to alleviate poverty as a means to combat disease, Alison was ahead of his time but he lived to see public opinion move closer to his initiatives.

==Personal life==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}

He married his first cousin Margaret Craufurd/Crawford Gregory (1809–1849), daughter of [[James Gregory (physician)|James Gregory]] in 1832; the marriage was childless.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Attacks of [[epilepsy]] forced him to retire in 1856, and he died at [[Colinton]] on 22 September 1859. He was interred at [[St John's Episcopal Cemetery]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Yona Friedman''' (born 5 June 1923, Budapest) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born French architect, urban planner and designer. He was influential in the late 1950s and early 1960s, best known for his theory of mobile architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=William |date=19 April 2016 |title=cities in the sky: re-evaluating yona friedman |url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/cities-in-the-sky-re-evaluating-yona-friedman/ |newspaper=3am |access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==
Yona Friedman has been through the Second World War escaping the Nazi roundups and lived for about a decade in the city of [[Haifa]] in [[Israel]] before moving permanently to Paris in 1957. He became a French citizen in 1966.

In 1956, the X International Congress of Modern Architecture in Dubrovnik, his "Manifeste de l'architecture mobile" contributed to question definitely the daring will planning to architectural design and urbanism. It was during that conference, and thanks especially to the youth of the Team 10, that "mobile architecture" was coined in the sense of "mobility of living." With the example of "Ville spatiale", Friedman set out - for the first time - the principles of an architecture capable of understanding the constant changes that characterize the "social mobility" and based on "infrastructure" that provide housing. Planning rules could be created and recreated, according to the need of the inhabitants and residents. Its focus on people themselves arises from its direct experience of homeless refugees, first in European cities facing war and disaster and later in Israel, where, in the early years of the State, thousands of people landed every day, with housing problems .

== Maturity ==
In 1958, he founded the Groupe d'études de architecture mobile (GEAM), dissolved in 1962.
In 1963, he developed the idea of a city bridge and participated actively in the cultural climate and utopian architecture of the 60s known as the "Age of megastructures". Since the mid-sixties he has taught at MIT, Princeton, Harvard and Columbia universities. In the following decade he worked for the United Nations and UNESCO, through the dissemination of self-building manuals in African countries, South America and India. Despite the perennial utopian label, Friedman said: "I have always tried, in architectural studies, to develop projects that were feasible."
In 1978, he was commissioned to design the Lycée Bergson in Angers, [[France]], completed in 1981. On this occasion he published a procedure in which the distribution and arrangement of all the architectural elements were designed and decided by future users. Because even non-professionals can understand and apply his method, he wrote also howto comics.
Interest in the issue of participation has brought Friedman to architects like [[Giancarlo De Carlo]] and [[Bernard Rudofsky]].

In 1987, in Madras, India, Friedman completed the Museum of Simple Technology in which the principles of self-construction from local materials like bamboo were applied.
He also authored books dealing with technical subjects (''For a scientific architecture'', Workshop 1975), sociological (''L'architecture du survie'', L'éclat 2003) and epistemological (''L'univers erratique '', PUF 1994).
The book that best represents, however,  Friedman's ethics and spirit is perhaps "Utopies Réalisables (French for ''feasible utopias''), published in France in 1975 and also published in Italian (Quodlibet 2003) describing a project to restructure our society in a genuine democratic way, seeking to escape any elitism through the theory of the critical group. The book is also a fierce critique of the myth of global communication.
From the book: "The analysis of social utopias presented in this book implies, implicitly in the act of accusation and criticism of these two 'plagues' of our times which are: 'the state mafia' and the 'media mafia' (press, television etc.). The existence of a state mafia results from the impossibility of the classic democratic state to keep the shape once its size exceeds certain limits, and the 'media mafia' is a direct result of the same inability in global communication ( Worldwide). The Internet can be used as an example of this inability, which is not the result of technical difficulties but rather stems from the fundamental human inability to communicate universally (from all to all). The failure of these two generous utopias, democracy and the 'global communication' between men, logically leads to the formation of gangs who act on our behalf against our interests.
As well as an indictment, this book will simultaneously be an act of encouragement: the individual should be encouraged not to offer their help or their tacit consent to these two gangs. It is not a call for revolution, but a call to resistance. "

==Mobile architecture==

In 1958, Yona Friedman published his first manifesto : "Mobile architecture". It described a new kind of mobility not of the buildings, but for the inhabitants, who are given a new freedom.

Mobile architecture is the "dwelling decided on by the occupant" by way of "infrastructures that are neither determined nor determining". Mobile architecture embodies an architecture available for a "mobile society". To deal with it, the classical architect invented "the Average Man". The projects of architects in the 1950s were undertaken, according to Friedman, to meet the needs of this make-believe entity, and not as an attempt to meet the needs of the actual members of this mobile society.

The teaching of architecture was largely responsible for the "classical" architect's under-estimation of the role of the user. Furthermore, this teaching did not embrace any real theory of architecture. Friedman proposed then teaching manuals for the fundamentals of architecture for the general public.

The spatial city, which is a materialization of this theory, makes it possible for everyone to develop his or her own hypothesis. This is why, in the mobile city, buildings should :
# touch the ground over a minimum area
# be capable of being dismantled and moved
# and be alterable as required by the individual occupant.

==The Spatial City==

The Spatial City is the most significant application of "mobile architecture". It is  raised up on piles which contains inhabited volumes, fitted inside some of the "voids", alternating with other unused volumes, making it look aesthetically pleasant. The basis of its design is that of trihedral elements which operate as "neighbourhoods" where dwellings are distributed without a price.

This structure introduces a kind of merger between countryside and city (compare to [[Paolo Soleri]]'s [[Arcology]] concept) and may span:
* certain unavailable sites,
* areas where building is not possible or permitted (expanses of water, marshland),
* areas that have already been built upon (an existing city),
* above farmland.

This spanning technique which includes container structures ushers in a new development in town-planning. Raised plans increase the original area of the city becoming three-dimensional. The tiering of the spatial city on several independent levels, one on top of the other, determines "spatial town-planning" both from the functional and from the aesthetic viewpoint. The lower level may be earmarked for public life and for premises designed for community services as well as pedestrian areas. The piles contain the vertical means of transport (lifts, staircases). The superposition of levels should make it possible to build a whole industrial city, or a residential or commercial city, on the same site. In this way, the Spatial City forms what Yona Friedman would call an "artificial [[topography]]". This grid suspended in space outlines a new cartography of the terrain with the help of a continuous and indeterminate homogeneous network with a major positive outcome: this modular grid would authorize the limitless growth of the city.

The spaces in this grid are rectangular and habitable modular "voids", with an average area of 25-35 square meters. Conversely, the form of the volumes included within the grid depends solely on the occupant, and their configuration set with a "Flatwriter" in the grid is completely free. Only one half of the spatial city would be occupied. The "fillings" which correspond to the dwellings only actually take up 50% of the three-dimensional lattice, permitting the light to spread freely in the spatial city. This introduction of elements on a three-dimensional grid with several levels on piles permits a changeable occupancy of the space by means of the convertibility of the forms and their adaptation to multiple uses.

In Yona Friedman's own words "The city, as a mechanism, is thus nothing other than a labyrinth : a configuration of points of departure, and terminal points, separated by obstacles".
