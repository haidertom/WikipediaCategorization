'''Allegory in the Middle Ages''' was a vital element in the synthesis of biblical and [[classical tradition]]s into what would become recognizable as medieval culture. People of the [[Middle Ages]] consciously drew from the cultural legacies of the ancient world in shaping their institutions and ideas, and so [[allegory]] in [[medieval literature]] and [[medieval art]] was a prime mover for the synthesis and transformational continuity between the ancient world and the "new" Christian world.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt;

People of the Middle Ages did not see the same break between themselves and their classical predecessors that modern observers see; rather, they saw continuity with themselves and the ancient world, using [[allegory]] as a synthesizing agent that brings together a whole image.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt;

==Four types of interpretation or ''allēgoria''==

For most medieval thinkers there were four categories of interpretation (or meaning) used in the Middle Ages, which had originated with the Bible commentators of the early Christian era.&lt;ref name=barney&gt;Stephen A. Barney (1989). "Allegory". ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]''. vol-1. {{ISBN|0-684-16760-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

# The first is simply the ''[[literal and figurative language|literal]]'' interpretation of the events of the story for historical purposes with no underlying meaning. 
# The second is called ''[[typology (theology)|typological]]'': it connects the events of the [[Old Testament]] with the [[New Testament]]; in particular drawing allegorical connections between the events of Christ's life with the stories of the Old Testament. 
# The third is ''[[moral]]'' (or ''[[tropological]]''), which is how one should act in the present, the "moral of the story". 
# The fourth type of interpretation is ''[[anagogical]]'', dealing with the future events of Christian history, heaven, hell, the last judgment; it deals with prophecies.

Thus the four types of interpretation (or meaning) deal with past events (literal), the connection of past events with the present (typology), present events (moral), and the future (anagogical).&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

[[Dante]] describes interpreting through a "four-fold method" (or "allegory of the theologians") in his [[epistle]] to [[Scaliger|Can Grande della Scala]]. He says the "senses" of his work are not simple, but:

{{cquote|Rather, it may be called "[[polysemy|polysemous]]", that is, of many senses. A first sense derives from the letters themselves, and a second from the things signified by the letters. We call the first sense "literal" sense, the second the "allegorical", or "moral" or "anagogical". To clarify this method of treatment, consider this verse: ''When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a barbarous people: Judea was made his sanctuary, Israel his dominion'' (Psalm 113). Now if we examine the letters alone, the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt in the time of Moses is signified; in the allegory, our redemption accomplished through Christ; in the moral sense, the conversion of the soul from the grief and misery of sin to the state of grace; in the anagogical sense, the exodus of the holy soul from slavery of this corruption to the freedom of eternal glory.. they can all be called allegorical.
}}

=== Old and New Testaments ===

Medieval allegory began as a Christian method for synthesizing the discrepancies between the Old Testament and the New Testament.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; While both testaments were studied and seen as equally divinely inspired by [[God]], the Old Testament contained discontinuities for Christians—for example the Jewish [[kosher]] laws.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; The Old Testament was therefore seen in relation to how it would predict the events of the New Testament, in particular how the events of the Old Testament related to the events of Christ's life. The events of the Old Testament were seen as part of the story, with the events of Christ's life bringing these stories to a full conclusion. The technical name for seeing the New Testament in the Old is called ''[[typology (theology)|typology]]''.

[[Image:Biblia.pauperum.jpg|250px|thumb|Christ rises from the tomb, alongside Jonah spit onto the beach, a typological allegory.]]

One example of typology is the story of [[Jonah]] and the whale from the Old Testament.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; Medieval allegorical interpretation of this story is that it prefigures Christ's burial, with the stomach of the whale as Christ's tomb. Jonah was eventually freed from the whale after three days, so did Christ rise from his tomb after three days. Thus, whenever one finds an allusion to Jonah in Medieval art or literature, it is usually an allegory for the burial and resurrection of Christ.

Another common typological allegory is with the four major Old testament prophets [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]], [[Ezekiel]], and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]. These four prophets prefigure the four Apostles [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], and [[John the Apostle|John]]. There was no end to the number of analogies that commentators could find between stories of the Old Testament and the New.

There also existed a tradition in the Middle Ages of ''[[mythography]]''—the allegorical interpretation of pagan myths.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt; [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' and [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' were standard textbooks throughout the Middle Ages, and each had a long tradition of allegorical interpretation. 
:"An illustrative example can be found in [[Siena]] in a painting of Christ on the cross (''Sano di Pietro's Crucifix'', 15th c). At the top of the cross can be seen a bird pecking its own breast, blood pouring forth from the wound and feeding its waiting chicks below. This is the [[pelican]] whose "story" was told by the Roman naturalist [[Pliny the Elder]]. Thus by analogy to a "[[paganism|pagan]]" source,  Christ feeds his own children with his own blood."

Mediaeval philosophers also saw allegory in the natural world, interpreting animals, plants, and even non-living things in books called [[bestiary|bestiaries]] as symbols of Biblical figures and morals.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;  For example, one bestiary compares [[stag]]s with people devoted to the Church, because (according to medieval zoology) they leave their pastures for other (heavenly) pastures, and when they come to broad rivers (sin) they form in line and each rests its head on the haunches of the next (supporting each other by example and good works), speeding across the waters together.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Beasts'', trans. [[T. H. White]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of allegory==

===Late Antiquity===
The early allegorizing trait in the interpretation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] figures prominently in the massive oeuvre of a prominent Hellenized Jew of Alexandria, [[Philo Judaeus]] (c. 20 BCE – c. 50 CE), whose allegorical reading of the [[Septuagint]] synthesized the traditional Jewish narratives with [[Platonism]]. Philo's allegorizing, in which he continued an earlier tradition, had little effect in later Jewish thought, in part because the Jewish culture of Alexandria dispersed by the fourth century.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;Norman F. Cantor, [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/321173.The_Civilization_of_the_Middle_Ages''The Civilization of the Middle Ages''], 1993:40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian writers such as [[Origen]] (184/185 – 253/254) took up the allegorized interpretations and began to read the Old Testament as a series of prefigurations of the New Testament,&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; in a time when rhetorical training was common, when the classics of mythology were still standard teaching texts, when the Greek and Roman pantheon of gods were still visible forms (if not always fully recognized by the more learned populace), and when the new religions such as Christianity adopted or rejected pagan elements by way of ''allegoresis'' (the study and interpretation of allegory).

[[Prudentius]] wrote the first surviving Christian purely allegorical freestanding work, ''[[Psychomachia]]'' ("Soul-War"), about AD 400.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; The plot consists of the personified "good" virtues of Hope, Sobriety, Chastity, Humility, etc. fighting the personified "evil" vices of Pride, Wrath, Paganism, Avarice, etc. The [[personification]]s are women, because in Latin words for abstract concepts have feminine grammatical gender; an uninformed reader of the work might take the story literally as a tale of many angry women fighting one another, because Prudentius provides no context or explanation of the allegory.&lt;ref name=cook&gt;William R. Cook and Ronald B. Herzman (2001). ''Discovering the Middle Ages''. [[The Teaching Company]]. {{ISBN|1-56585-701-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this same period of the early 5th century three other authors of importance to the history of allegory emerged: [[Claudian]], [[Macrobius]] and [[Martianus Capella]]. Little is known of these authors, even if they were "truly" Christian or not, but we do know they handed down the inclination to express learned material in allegorical form, mainly through personification, which later became a standard part of medieval schooling methods.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

Claudian's first work ''In Rufinum'' attacked the ruthless [[Rufinus (Byzantine official)|Rufinus]] and would become a model for the 12th century ''[[Alanus de Insulis Anticlaudianus|Anticlaudianus]]'', a well known allegory for how to be an upstanding man. As well his ''Rape of Prosperpine'' served up a litany of mythological allegories, personifications, and [[cosmological allegory|cosmological allegories]].&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

[[Neoplatonist]] commentators&lt;ref name=calian/&gt; used allegory as a [[rhetorical]], philosophical and religious devise in reading Ancient mythology, [[Homer]],&lt;ref name=lamberton&gt;Robert Lamberton (1989). ''Homer the Theologian: Neoplatonist Allegorical Reading and the Growth of the Epic Tradition'' (London: University of California Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Plato]].&lt;ref name=calian&gt;Florin Calian (2013).[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256848245_Clarifications_of_Obscurity_Conditions_for_Proclus's_Allegorical_Reading_of_Plato's_Parmenides ''“Clarifications” of Obscurity: Conditions for Proclus’s Allegorical Reading of Plato’s Parmenides''] Obscurity in Medieval Texts (Krems: Institut für Realienkunde des Mittelalters und der frühen Neuzeit)&lt;/ref&gt;

Macrobius wrote ''Commentary of the Dream of Scipio'', providing the Middle Ages with the tradition of a favorite topic, the allegorical treatment of dreams.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

Lastly Martianus Capella wrote ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'' ("Marriage of Philology and Mercury"), the title referring to the allegorical union of intelligent learning with the love of letters. It contained short treatises on the "[[seven liberal arts]]" (grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, music) and thus became a standard textbook, greatly influencing educators and students throughout the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

[[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]], perhaps the most influential author of [[Late Antiquity]], first introduced readers of his work ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' to the personified Lady Philosophy, the source of innumerable later personified figures (such as Lady Luck, [[Fortuna|Lady Fortune]], etc.)&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

===Early Middle Ages===
After Boethius there exists no known work of allegorical literature until the 12th century. Although allegorical thinking, elements and artwork abound during this period, it was not until the rise of the medieval university in the High Middle Ages that sustained allegorical literature appears again.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

===High and Late Middle Ages===
The earliest works were by [[Hugh of St Victor]] (''[[Didascalicon]]'', 1125{{cn|date=February 2018}}), [[Bernard Silvestris]] (''[[Cosmographia (Bernard Silvestris)|Cosmographia]]'', 1147), and [[Alanus ab Insulis]] (''Plaint of Nature'', 1170, and ''Anticlaudianus'') who pioneered the use of allegory (mainly personification) for abstract speculation on metaphysics and scientific questions.

The High and Late Middle Ages saw many allegorical works and techniques. There were four great works from this period.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;
*'''The Four Great Medieval Allegories'''
**''[[Le Roman de la Rose]]''. A major allegorical work, it had many lasting influences on western literature, creating entire new genres and development of vernacular languages.
**''[[The Divine Comedy]]''. Ranked amongst the greatest medieval works, both allegorically and as a work of literature; was (and remains) hugely popular.
**''[[Piers Plowman]]''. An encyclopedic array of allegorical devices. Dream-vision; pilgrimage; personification; satire; typological story structure (the dreamer's progress mirrors the progress of biblical history from the Fall of Adam to Apocalypse).
**''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]''. A plot based on an [[anagogical]] allegory; a dreamer is introduced to heavenly Jerusalem. Focus on the meaning of death. A religious response to ''Consolation of Philosophy''.

'''Aniridia'''  is the absence of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]], usually involving both eyes. It can be congenital or caused by a penetrant injury.&lt;ref  name="Lang2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ophthalmology: A Pocket  Textbook Atlas  (2nd ed.) |page=208 |author=Lang, K |year=2007  |publisher=Thieme  |isbn=1-58890-555-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Isolated aniridia is a [[congenital]] disorder which is not limited to a defect in iris development,  but is a  panocular condition with [[macular hypoplasia|macular]] and [[optic nerve hypoplasia]], [[cataract]],  and [[cornea]]l changes.&lt;ref name="eMedicine"&gt;{{cite  web|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1208379-overview  |title=Aniridia |publisher=eMedicine |first=Daljit |last=Singh |author2=Arun Verma  |accessdate=2 February 2010 |date=17 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vision may be severely compromised and the disorder is frequently associated with a number of ocular complications: [[nystagmus]], [[amblyopia]], [[buphthalmos]], and [[cataract]].&lt;ref  name="Lang2" /&gt; Aniridia in some individuals occurs as part of a syndrome, such as [[WAGR syndrome]] ([[Wilms tumour|kidney nephroblastoma]] (Wilms tumour), genitourinary anomalies and intellectual disability), or [[Gillespie syndrome]] ([[cerebellar ataxia]]).

==PAX6==

[[File:Human eyeball with phenotypic expression of aniridia with PAX6 gene mutation.jpg|thumb|left|Phenotypic expression of aniridia with [[PAX6]] gene mutation. The aniridic  probands showed typical features of [[sclerocornea]] with nystagmus in proband 28–1 (A); Foveal hypoplasia in  proband 27–1 (B);  Ptosis, microcornea with dislocated cataractous lens in proband 10–1 (C); Ectopia lentis in  proband 16–1 (D).]]

The AN2 region of the short  arm of [[chromosome 11]] (11p13) includes the [[PAX6]] gene (named for its PAired boX status), whose gene product helps regulate a cascade of other genetic processes involved in the development of the eye (as well as other non-ocular structures).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal |vauthors=Lee H, Khan R, O'Keefe M |title=Aniridia: current pathology and management |journal=Acta Ophthalmol |volume=86  |issue=7  |pages=708–15 | date=November 2008 |pmid=18937825  |doi=10.1111/j.1755-3768.2008.01427.x  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This PAX6 gene is around 95% similar to the pax gene found in [[zebrafish]], a creature whose ancestors diverged from human evolutionary development around 400 million years ago. Thus the PAX6 gene is  highly conserved across [[evolution]]ary  lineages.

Defects in the PAX6 gene cause aniridia-like ocular defects in [[mice]] (as well as ''[[Drosophila]]''). Aniridia is a [[heterozygous]] disorder, meaning that only one of the two [[chromosome 11]] copies is affected. When both copies are altered ([[homozygous]] condition), the result is a uniformly fatal condition with near complete failure of entire eye formation. In 2001, two cases of  homozygous aniridia patients were reported; the fetuses died prior to birth and had severe brain damage. In mice, homozygous ''small eye'' defect (mouse Pax-6) leads to loss of the eyes and nose and the murine fetuses suffer severe brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal |last=Gehring |first=W. J. | date= 2001 |title=The genetic control of eye development and its implications for the evolution of various eye-types |journal=Zoology  |volume=104 |issue=3–4 |pages=171–181 |doi=10.1078/0944-2006-00022 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Aniridia may be broadly divided  into hereditary and sporadic forms. Hereditary aniridia is usually transmitted in an [[autosomal dominant]] manner (each offspring has a 50% chance of being affected), although rare [[autosomal recessive]] forms (such as [[Gillespie syndrome]]) have also been reported. Sporadic aniridia [[mutations]] may affect the WT1 region adjacent to the AN2 aniridia region, causing a kidney cancer called [[nephroblastoma]] ([[Wilms tumor]]). These patients often also have genitourinary abnormalities and [[intellectual disability]] ([[WAGR syndrome]]).

Several different mutations may affect the PAX6 gene. Some mutations appear to inhibit gene function more than others, with subsequent variability in the severity of the disease. Thus, some aniridic individuals are only missing a relatively small amount of iris, do not have [[foveal hypoplasia]], and retain relatively normal [[Visual perception|vision]]. Presumably, the genetic defect in these individuals causes less "heterozygous insufficiency," meaning they retain enough gene function to yield a milder [[phenotype]].

==Mutational analysis==
Molecular ([[DNA]]) testing for PAX6 gene mutations (by [[sequencing]] of the entire [[coding region]] and [[deletion/duplication analysis]]) is available for isolated aniridia and the Gillespie syndrome. For the WAGR syndrome, [[high-resolution cytogenetic analysis]] and [[fluorescence in situ hybridization]] (FISH) can be utilized to identify deletions within chromosome band 11p13, where both the PAX6 and WT1 genes are located.

==Treatment==
In May 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the CustomFlex Artificial Iris, the first [[artificial iris|synthetic iris]] for use in adults and children with congenital aniridia or iris defects related to other conditions, such as [[albinism]], traumatic injury, or surgical removal due to [[ocular melanoma]]. The artificial iris is a surgically implanted device made of thin, foldable, medical-grade [[silicone]] and is custom-sized and colored for each individual patient. The prosthetic iris is held in place by the anatomical structures of the eye or, if needed, by sutures.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/897386&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated $110 million of art was lost in the [[September 11 attacks]]: $100 million in private art&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news |date=11 October 2001 |title=A museum in the sky |url= http://www.economist.com/node/814452 |work= The Economist |access-date= 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $10 million in public art.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news |date=16 October 2001 |title=Lost Art Hundreds of Works Were Destroyed in the Trade Center Attack |url= https://www.npr.org/news/specials/response/home_front/features/2001/oct/011016.lostart.html|work=National Public Radio |access-date= 1 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacks were said to be "the biggest single disaster ever to affect the [art] industry".&lt;ref name= "BBC"&gt;{{cite news |date= 5 October 2001|title='Up to' $100m art lost in attacks |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1581737.stm|work= BBC |location= |access-date= 1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Port Authority]] held an estimated 100 pieces of art work at the World Trade Center Complex, in addition to the seven public works of art that had been created for the World Trade Center, all of which were destroyed or severely damaged.

==Public art==
An estimated $10 million worth of public art was lost due to the collapse of the World Trade Center.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;

There were seven one-of-a-kind public works of art in the World Trade Center Complex at the time of the attacks:
* ''[[Cloud Fortress]]'' by [[Masayuki Nagare]]
* ''[[The Sphere]]'' by [[Fritz Koenig]]
* ''[[Ideogram (sculpture)|Ideogram]]'' by [[James Rosati]]
* ''[[Bent Propeller]]'' by [[Alexander Calder]]
* ''[[The World Trade Center Tapestry]]'' by [[Joan Miró]] and [[Josep Royo]]
* ''[[Sky Gate, New York]]'' by [[Louise Nevelson]]
* ''[[1993 bombing memorial fountain]]'' by [[Elyn Zimmerman]]

''Ideogram'', ''The World Trade Center Tapestry'', and ''Sky Gate, New York'' were never recovered from the rubble and are presumed destroyed.

''Cloud Fortress'' survived the attack and collapse of the buildings, but was severely damaged and subsequently cleared by rescue workers in the days after the attacks.

''Bent Propeller'' was partially recovered from the rubble. Only a small piece of the 1993 bombing memorial fountain was recovered.

''The Sphere'' was damaged in the attacks, but was refurbished and put on display as a memorial.

In addition to the seven public art works, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey|Port Authority]] also had approximately 100 pieces of art on the complex, including:
* ''Recollection Pond'', a tapestry by [[Romare Bearden]] [https://www.artsy.net/artwork/romare-bearden-recollection-pond]
* ''Path Mural'' by [[Germaine Keller]] 
* ''Commuter Landscape'', a mural by [[Cynthia Mailman]] [https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS819US819&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=HAnVW72aGLOBk-4PrK6y0A0&amp;q=Commuter+Landscape%27%27%2C+Cynthia+Mailman&amp;oq=Commuter+Landscape%27%27%2C+Cynthia+Mailman&amp;gs_l=img.3...237130.239714..239971...0.0..0.53.201.4......0....1..gws-wiz-img.ZPQZa0LSbYc#imgrc=fvRcqYJKJc6E2M:]

==Private art collections==
The World Trade Center alone held more than 430 tenants at the time of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/trade.center/tenants1.html |title=List of World Trade Center tenants|website=cnn.com |publisher=CNN |access-date= 1 December 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the decorative art that each office contained, some firms held large corporate art collections.

Three companies held major corporate art collections in the World Trade Center: Fred Alger, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Bank of America. Aside from these three, all other companies in the World trade center kept their artwork in other locations.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

===Cantor Fitzgerald===
In addition to losing the most lives in the attack, [[Cantor Fitzgerald]] lost the most artwork. Their offices on the 105th floor of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|North Tower]] housed a gallery called the “Museum in the Sky” which held an estimated 300 casts of [[Rodin]] sculptures.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

Some of the Rodin works were recovered a quarter mile away from Ground Zero, including a bust from ''[[The Burghers of Calais]]'', two of the three figures from ''The Three Shades'', and a cast of ''[[The Thinker]]''. After being recovered, ''The Thinker'' cast went missing, possibly due to theft.&lt;ref name="Born" /&gt;

===Citigroup===
The collection of Citigroup, whose office was in [[List of tenants in 7 World Trade Center|
World Trade Center Building 7]], contained 1113 works of art which were all lost on September 11, 2001, according to Suzanne F. W. Lemakis who was the Citigroup Art Curator at the time of the attacks.&lt;ref name="Citigroup1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ifar.org/nineeleven/911_citi1.htm |title=

The Citigroup collection at the World Trade Center consisted of about 75% prints, many of which were mass-produced and were replaceable. Also lost were English and American antique furniture, and Asian porcelains.&lt;ref name="Citigroup2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ifar.org/nineeleven/911_citi2.htm |title=

According to Lemakis, the most expensive painting in Citigroup’s collection was a large mural depicting Wall Street, painted by an unknown designer.&lt;ref name="Citigroup2" /&gt;

===Fred Alger===
Also located in the North Tower, this firm lost a collection of photographs by photographers including [[Cindy Sherman]] and [[Hiroshi Sugimoto]].&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

===Bank of America===
Bank of America’s office in the World Trade Center lost over 100 works of art by contemporary artists.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

===J.P. Morgan Chase=== 
At the time of the attack, the firm had only five lithographs in its Trade Center office, keeping most of its corporate art collection of over 17,000 works of art at its offices two blocks from the World Trade Center.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Born"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Barry|first1=Dan |last2= Rashbaum|first2=William K.|date= 20 May 2002|title=Born of Hell, Lost After Inferno; Rodin Work From Trade Center Survived, and Vanished |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/20/nyregion/born-hell-lost-after-inferno-rodin-work-trade-center-survived-vanished.html|work= New York Times|location= New York City|access-date=1 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art studios in the World Trade Center==
The Lower Manhattan Cultural Council had its offices in Building 5 of the World Trade Center, and two studios on the 91st and 92nd floors of [[The North Tower]].  
The Council hosted an artist-in-residency program, called World Views, which hosted 15 artists from around the globe and was supposed to run from May–November 2001. The 15 artists worked in the studios in the North Tower. Nearly all of their artwork was lost in the attack on and subsequent collapse of the towers. At least one of the artists, Jamaican-born sculptor Michael Richards, also died in the attacks. Richards had worked through the night in the towers on an unfinished sculpture, a memorial piece dedicated to the [[Tuskegee Airmen]], which portrayed a pilot riding a burning meteor.&lt;ref name="NPR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cotter"&gt;{{cite news |last= Cotter|first=Holland |date= 3 December 2001|title=ART REVIEW; The Studios Were Lost, But the Artists Get Their Day |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/03/arts/art-review-the-studios-were-lost-but-the-artists-get-their-day.html|work= New York Times|location= New York City|access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "BBC" /&gt;

The council also lost all of its archives that had been in their offices in Building 5.&lt;ref name="Cotter" /&gt;

==Government art collections==
Twenty-four works from the art collections of the [[Army]], [[Navy]], [[Air Force]], and [[Marine Corps]] were destroyed at [[The Pentagon]] by the attack.

Some works from The Pentagon's library were also damaged, but the majority were ultimately restored.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news |last1= Bridge|first1=Sarah |last2=Kazi |first2=Stastna|date=21 August 2011 |title= 9/11 anniversary: What was lost in the damage|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/9-11-anniversary-what-was-lost-in-the-damage-1.1123528 |work=CBC |access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insurance payouts==
Much of the art was not insured for its full value.&lt;ref name="Economist" /&gt;

Such posts are manned by [[border guard]]s and are at all times connected by [[radio communication]] with ongoing border patrols in their [[region]] and the force headquarters in the interior of the country for their day-to-day functioning, passing on [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and for requesting supplies and any needed reinforcements in emergencies.

Depending on the length and breath of a country's borders and geography, are located in a wide variety of terrain, including the inhospitable areas that often mark political boundaries.

==Layout==
Border outposts, where available, are built on strategic locations which are usually elevated at the highest points in the local terrain and where possible on hilltops along the border.

Depending upon [[international relations]] with the neighboring country and local [[Military strategy|strategic]] needs, BOPs are sometimes built with an assortment of a few administration and residential buildings or [[tent]]s, an [[Armory (military)|armory]], [[trenches]], [[bunkers]], [[wire obstacle]]s and fortified [[machine gun]] positions with a [[watchtower]].

A [[flagpole]] flying the country's [[national flag]] may be located on the premise along with a [[Antenna (radio)|Wireless Communication Antenna]] and a designated clearing as a make-do [[helipad]].

==Peacetime function==
Border outposts are manned in peacetime by the border guard to check [[smuggling]], [[Espionage|infiltration]] by [[spy|spies]] of untrusted neighboring countries, [[insurgents]] bent on smuggling weapons and explosives for [[terrorist]] attacks and [[subversive]] activities, [[illegal immigration]] and [[human trafficking]] etc.. They usually have [[watchtower]]s where soldiers are posted day and night on [[General Orders for Sentries|Sentry duty]] looking for intruders and illegal cross-border activity of any kind. Patrols go out regularly to patrol the international border to check illegal crossings and track any footprints of those who may have crossed over illegally or attempted to. In case intrusion by foreign elements is confirmed, it is the responsibility of the Border guard based on the BOP to trace the intruders by checking the nearby settlements, villages and towns and inform the law enforcement agencies, Customs and Police authorities.&lt;ref name="Bollywood film Border (1997)"&gt;Indian [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Border (1997 film)|Border]]'' (1997) made with the official assistance of the [[Border Security Force]] (BSF), [[Indian Army]] and [[Indian Airforce]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bollywood film Refugee (2000)"&gt;Indian Bollywood film ''[[Refugee (2000 film)|Refugee]]'' (2000) made with the official assistance of the Border Security Force (BSF)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime function==
During [[war]]time however the Border guard, the special forces tasked with patrolling the border in peacetime, withdraw from the Border outposts and provide assistance in a limited capacity to the country's regular [[Army]] which then comes and mans all the border outposts at the international border facing the enemy neighboring country. Wartime assistance of the Border guard to the Army is essential as they are familiar with the local terrain having patrolled it on a daily basis during peacetime. During [[war]]s these BOPs are reworked into well [[fortification|fortified]] dug-in positions from where regular [[Army (unit)|Army unit]]s can operate to defend the territorial integrity of the country.&lt;ref name="Bollywood film Border (1997)"/&gt;

'''Climate Impacts Research Centre''' (CIRC) is a [[research institute]] based at the ''Department of ecology and environmental science'' (EMG) at [[Umeå University]], [[Sweden]], but primarily operative at [[Abisko Scientific Research Station]] which is run by the [[Swedish Polar Research Secretariat]].

== Research ==
The CIRC research is focused on increasing the knowledge about [[Arctic]] and [[alpine climate]] [[ecosystem]]s, for better understanding of [[climate]] related impacts on [[subarctic]] and arctic environments, both in [[terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial]] (land based) and [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic ecosystems]].

Within the field of [[arctic ecology]] CIRC researchers conduct projects about how the [[tree line]] is affected by [[climate change]]; how [[reindeer]]s influence [[Fell]] vegetation, and the spread of fish species in lakes and watercourses – historically as well as in the light of recent climate change.

In [[biogeochemistry]] researchers study [[watercourse]]s in northern areas, as well as effects of thawing [[permafrost]] in the [[tundra]] and other [[alpine climate|alpine environments]], with regard to [[emission intensity|emissions]] of [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gases]] to the [[atmosphere]] and [[export]] of [[carbon]] to coastal areas.

[[King Carl XVI Gustaf Professorship in Environmental Science]] 2017/18 was awarded to [[John Anderson (physiographist)|John Anderson]], professor in [[physical geography]] and [[paleolimnology]] at [[Loughborough University]] in the [[United Kingdom]], who will be [[visiting professor]] at CIRC these two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kungahuset.se/press/pressmeddelanden/2016/2016pressmeddelanden/innehavareavhmkonungensprofessurimiljovetenskaputsedd.5.186e1cb158b43194193d9.html |title=Innehavare av H.M.

=== Major research projects ===
In 2016 CIRC was granted 37 million SEK over five years by the [[Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation]] for the project "Climate change induced regime shifts in northern lake ecosystems", with Jan Karlsson as principal investigator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Research Projects 2016 |url=https://www.wallenberg.com/kaw/en/research/grants/research-projects-2016 |website=The Wallenberg Foundations |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wallenberg Academy Fellows ===
As of 2017 three young researchers at CIRC are also appointed Wallenberg Academy Fellows – a career programme, initiated by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation in close collaboration with five royal academies and sixteen universities in Sweden, that provides long-term funding for the most promising young researchers of all disciplines to develop their projects.

== Education ==
Since 2002 CIRC also gives education, like courses in ''Arctic ecology, Arctic geoecology'' and ''Fell ecology'', and a postgraduate program. CIRC is also connected to the international cooperative network [[University of the Arctic]].

== History ==
CIRC was founded in 1996 and now (2017) employs some 50 researchers; professors, [[assistant professor]]s, [[post doc]]s, [[doctoral student]]s and visiting professors. Most CIRC researchers are also affiliated to Arcum, [[Arctic Research Centre at Umeå University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arcum.umu.se/english/affiliated-researchers/science-and-technology/ |title=Arcum - Affiliated Researchers - Science and Technology |date=2017-03-10 |publisher=Umeå University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

CIRC's first [[director (education)|science director]] was Reiner Giesler, professor in terrestrial ecology, who in 2015 was followed by Jan Karlsson, professor in physical geography with a specialization in aquatic biogeochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umu.se/forskning/popularvetenskap/forskarportratt/professorer-2012/jan-karlsson |title=Växthusgaser och produktivitet i akvatiska ekosystem |date=2017-03-10 |publisher=Umeå University |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15129">'''Climate Change Education''' (CCE) is learning geared toward helping people address and develop effective responses to [[climate change]]. It helps learners understand the causes and consequences of climate change, prepares them to live with the impacts of climate change and empowers learners to take appropriate actions to adopt more sustainable lifestyles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233083e.pdf|title=Not Just Hot Air: Putting Climate Change Education into Practice|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100101-7|location=|pages=6, 8, 10, 32, 40, 44, 46, 48, 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CCE helps policy-makers understand the urgency and importance of putting mechanisms into place to combat climate change on a national and global scale. Communities learn about how climate change will affect them, what they can do to protect themselves from negative consequences, and how they can reduce their own [[climate footprint]]. In particular, CCE helps increase the resilience of already vulnerable communities who are the most likely to be adversely affected by climate change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

CCE is rooted in [[Education for sustainable development|Education for Sustainable Development]] (ESD).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== UNESCO Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development programme ==
Established in 2010, the [[UNESCO]] Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development programme (CCESD) aims to help people understand climate change by expanding CCE activities in [[Nonformal learning|nonformal education]] through the media, networking and partnerships. It is grounded in the holistic approach of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) which incorporates key sustainable development issues such as climate change, [[disaster risk reduction]] and others into education, in a way that addresses the interdependence of environmental sustainability, economic viability and social justice. It promotes participatory teaching and learning methods that motivate and empower learners to change their behaviour and take action for sustainable development. The programme seeks to help people understand the impact of global warming today and increase ‘climate literacy’, especially among young people, and aims to make education a more central part of the international response to climate change. UNESCO works with national governments to integrate CCE into national [[Curriculum|curricula]] and to develop innovative teaching and learning approaches for doing so.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Selected country profiles regarding CCE and ESD ==

=== Australia ===
Australia has been at the forefront of [[Education for sustainable development|education for sustainability]], adopting in 2000 a national plan entitled Environmental Education for a Sustainable Future. A number of initiatives and bodies were created to implement the national plan, including the Australian Sustainable Schools Initiative and [[Australian Research Institute for Environment and Sustainability]]. These provided a strong foundation for Australia’s strategy, launched in 2006, to respond to the [[Education for sustainable development#United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development .28DESD.29|UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development]]. The strategy set out the goal to mainstream sustainability through a holistic approach that engages the community through education and [[lifelong learning]]. Whereas climate change was referred to as one of a number of environmental concerns in the first national plan, a new plan launched in 2009, entitled Living Sustainably: the Australian Government’s National Action Plan for Education for Sustainability, had a greater focus on climate change and its impacts on other natural resources within a wider global context. The new plan incorporated climate change within education for sustainability, rather than establishing a new and potentially competing field of Climate Change Education. Australia introduced its first-ever national curriculum in 2014, including sustainability as one of three cross-curriculum subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since 2009, Climate Change Education has been most evident in the [[TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)|VET sector]]. [[Council of Australian Governments|COAG]] endorsed the Green Skills Agreement in 2009, and the Ministerial Council for Vocational and Technical Education published the National VET Sector Sustainability Policy and Action Plan (2009-2012). These initiatives aimed to provide workers with the skills needed to transition to a low-carbon economy and VET teachers with suitable training packages to promote education for sustainability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== China ===
China introduced [[environmental education]] in the late 1970s as a result of increased attention to sustainable development and the need to protect the environment. Following the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), environmental education moved towards environment, population and development, and finally education for sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Chinese government has produced a number of policy documents identifying environmental education and ESD as key to quality education. In 2003, the Ministry of Education issued the first guiding policy - the Guidelines for Implementing Environmental Education in Elementary and Secondary School - on environmental education in China. ESD was formally incorporated into the national education policy in 2010 in The National Education Outline 2010-2020, and further integrated in some local education policies. National climate change policies and plans in China refer to education but do not specifically address CCE. This has resulted in limited institutional support to date. There is no national ESD or CCE action plan or official policy to inform its implementation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In China, ESD mainly refers to providing individuals with the scientific knowledge, learning capacity, values and lifestyle choices to meet the country’s sustainable development objectives. CCE is most commonly implemented as a component of ESD. A number of educational approaches have been adopted to facilitate the implementation of ESD. These include integrating ESD values into school philosophy, [[curriculum development]], capacity-building of teachers and educators, ESD pedagogical approaches and ESD and CCE thematic activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

ESD is a component of compulsory education, but is limited in higher education, VET and adult education. The Ministry of Education has recently issued a guidance document that identified the VET sector in particular as needing to be reformed to meet the sustainable development objectives of the Chinese economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Denmark ===
Denmark and its neighbouring countries began working together in the 1990s to formulate a policy for ESD. While Denmark signed the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) declaration on ESD in 2005, it did not adopt a strategy until 2009, just before the half-way point of the DESD. The Ministry of Education, which was made responsible for the DESD, organised a consultation process on how to promote ESD before adopting its strategy in 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The UN Climate Summit (COP15) held in Denmark in December 2009 provided the impetus to develop of a number of national ESD policy initiatives. A national strategy on ESD was developed with a substantial climate change component. The aim of the strategy is to make citizens more responsible for their actions by improving their scientific knowledge. The ESD strategy notes that climate change should not be the sole focus of ESD, though the concrete initiatives that are part of the strategy mostly support the CCE projects and activities that were part of COP15 preparations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A new national school curriculum adopted in 2009 included elements of ESD and CCE. The concept of sustainability was embedded in the goals describing the interrelationships between nature and society. CCE is mostly approached as teaching climate science, but it was also included in subjects such as geography and social studies, where the interrelationships between human behaviour, consumption and climate are examined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There has been no explicit policy change in the TVET sector to upgrade skills to respond to climate change and environmental issues. However, it is important to note that the Danish TVET sector had previously reflected skills related to ecological modernisation in areas such as energy generation, [[waste management]] and agriculture. While the new government identified the economic and environmental climate change crises as important, education is only referred to in relation to the economic crisis. There is no mention of climate change or sustainability with regard to education, and the platform documentation on ‘green transition’ does not mention education. Overall, no policy strategy has been set to promote ESD, CCE, or the ‘greening’ of TVET as part of the government’s sustainable development and climate change policies. Government initiatives support NGO-led projects to raise community awareness of climate change. A national network on ESD was established with funding through to 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Dominican Republic ===
The Dominican Republic has taken a lead role in promoting ESD. Environmental education was made mandatory for all schools in 1998 and this has since evolved into ESD. In 2000, the General Law of Environment and Natural Resources changed the way environmental education was taught, moving from a subject matter to a cross-cutting and interdisciplinary theme. Risk management is also an important aspect of MINERD’s strategic plan, and has been integrated into the school curriculum as a cross-cutting subject. In 2004, the Environmental Education Strategy for Sustainable Development was adopted, which fosters formal and non-formal ESD. It is based on constructivism and uses a variety of pedagogical techniques that promote participatory learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Ten-year 2008-2018 Education Plan (PDE) addresses the issue of quality education, including sustainable development and a culture of peace. It also established a process for periodic review of the curriculum. Climate change is also being introduced into the curriculum. The National Teacher Training Institute (INAFOCAM) and the Salomé Ureña Higher Institute for Teacher Training (ISFODOSU) provide support for environmental education through teacher training and curriculum support. The Ten-year 2008-2018 Higher Education Plan (PDES) includes environmental issues in the curricula and establishes a research programme to promote sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Dominican Republic has been involved in a number of ESD and CCE initiatives that have helped build local capacity, including:
* formal, non-formal and informal projects on ESD led by governmental agencies, civil society organizations, young leaders and local communities;
* UN: CC Learn Project, which supports the design and implementation of results-oriented and sustainable learning to address climate change (see the detailed case study in this Report);
* National Strategy to Strengthen Human Resource Capacities to Advance Green, Low Emission and Climate Resilient Development (ENDVBERC);
* teacher training supported by the UN: CC Learn-UNITAR, and the UNESCO-CCESD pilot programme.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== England ===
Environmental and development education have been present in England since the 1970s, when civil society organizations took the lead. From the late 1990s, the UK government promoted sustainable development and ESD at the local, regional and national levels. However, while a number of strategic government reports addressed CCE, government policy has focused less on ESD since 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 2008 report Brighter Futures – Greener Lives: Sustainable Development Action Plan 2008-2010 outlined a number of specific initiatives related to Climate Change Education using an ESD approach. This included empowering youth with the skills, knowledge and freedom to voice their opinions and make a difference. The same year, CCE was introduced into the Key Stage Three (11 to 14 year-olds) geography curriculum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The report Education for Sustainable Development in the UK 2010 noted that there were signs of substantial progress in embedding ESD-related policies and developing practices in the UK across a wide range of sectors in 2008 and 2009. For example, documents in 2009 highlighted the ‘Sustainable Schools’ project that aims to empower youth to cope with the future challenges facing the planet. The aim is for all schools to be ‘Sustainable Schools’ by 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Republic of Korea ===
The Republic of Korea has a number of policies and initiatives supporting environmental education. In 2008, the Environmental Education Promotion Act encouraged the development of environmental education. It aimed to raise national environmental awareness, to encourage people to develop research and inquiry skills, and to put what they learn into action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Ministry of Environment, in its 2011-2015 Environmental Education Master Plan, proposed a policy agenda for environmental education to be implemented through formal education, social environmental education and educational infrastructure approaches. The various approaches in the formal education area include:
* ‘Environment and Green Growth’ as an elective subject in middle and high school curricula, and classes in elementary school designed to integrate environmental education; 
* the establishment of the Natural Environmental Studies Institute that o ers interactive youth programmes for environmental studies;
* Environment Model Schools, designed to demonstrate best-practice;
* ‘Low Carbon Challenge’ involving ten universities;
* in-service training for teachers to upskill, specializing in environmental education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Cog's ladder''' of group development is based on the work, "Cog's Ladder: A Model of Group Growth", by [[George O. Charrier]], an employee of [[Procter and Gamble]], published in a company newsletter in 1972.  The original document was written to help group managers at Procter and Gamble better understand the dynamics of group work, thus improving efficiency.  It is now also used by the [[United States Naval Academy]], the [[United States Air Force Academy]], and other businesses – to help in understanding group development.&lt;ref&gt;Malthus, T. R., &amp; Mandal, B. N. (2008). The Principle of population: An essay on principle of population, as it affects the future improvement of society with remarks on the speculations of Mr. Godwin, M. Condorcet, and other writers. New Delhi, India: Global Vision Pub. House. p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==
The basic idea of Cog's ladder is that there are five steps necessary for a small group of people to be able to work efficiently together.  These stages are the ''polite stage'', the ''why we're here stage'', the ''power stage'', the ''cooperation stage'' and the ''esprit stage''.  Groups can only move forward after completing the current stage as in [[Jean Piaget]]'s stage model.

===Polite stage===
An introductory phase where members strive to get acquainted or reacquainted with one another. During this phase, the basis for the group structure is established and is characterized by polite social interaction. All ideas are simple, controversy is avoided and all members limit self-disclosure.  Judgements of other members are formed, and this sets the tone for the rest of the group's time.

===Why we're here stage===
Group members will want to know why they have been called together. The specific agenda for each planning session will be communicated by the moderator or leader. In this phase, individual need for approval begins to diminish as the members examine their group's purpose and begin to set goals.  Often, social cliques will begin to form as members begin to feel as though they "fit in."

===Power stage===
Bids for power begin between group members in an effort to convince each other that their position on an issue is correct.  Often, the field of candidates vying for leadership narrows, as fewer members strive to establish power.  Some of those who contributed freely to the group discussion in earlier stages now remain silent, wishing not to engage in a power struggle.  It is noted that interactions arising out of this phase do not usually result in optimum solutions.  Hence, there is a great need for structure and patience in this stage.*

===Cooperation stage===
Members not only begin to accept that others have an opinion worth expressing, but a team spirit replaces vested interests.  Often, new levels of creativity are achieved, and the group's productivity soars.  If new individuals are introduced into the membership at this point, they will be viewed as outsiders or intruders, and the group will have to evolve again, much as it did initially.

===Esprit stage===
Esprit de corps:  a golden rule by [[Henri Fayol]] is closely associated with this stage of Cog's, which says that nothing has higher pinnacles to reach than spirit of corps.

Mutual acceptance with high cohesiveness and a general feeling of esprit.  Charrier states that the planning team can do its finest work and be most productive in this final stage in the model.  It is also noted that this stage will not always be achieved; however, for this level of cooperation, as well as productivity, the other four stages must be met.

==Comparisons==
Cog's ladder is very similar to [[Forming-storming-norming-performing|Tuckman's stages]], another stage model of groups, which lacks the "Why We're Here" stage, and calls the remaining four stages "Forming", "Storming", "Norming", and "Performing". There are also other similar models, some of which are cyclic rather than reaching an end state.

A '''concept of operations''' (abbreviated '''CONOPS''', '''CONOPs''',&lt;ref name="hhsde"/&gt; or '''ConOps'''&lt;ref name="hhs"/&gt;) is a document describing the characteristics of a proposed [[system]] from the viewpoint of an individual who will use that system like a [[Business requirements|business requirements specification]] or [[stakeholder requirements specification (StRS)]]. It is used to communicate the [[quantitative property|quantitative]] and [[qualitative property|qualitative]] system characteristics to all [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s.&lt;ref name="hhs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/ConOps.pdf|title=Concept of Operations (ConOps)|publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2008-06-22|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611232934/http://www3.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/ConOps.pdf|archive-date=2009-06-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CONOPS are widely used in the military, governmental services and other fields.

A CONOPS generally evolves from a [[concept]] and is a description of how a set of [[capability (systems engineering)|capabilities]] may be employed to achieve desired [[objective (goal)|objective]]s or [[End States|end state]].&lt;ref name="hhsde"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/disasters/discussion/planners/conops.html |title=CONOPS |publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services |accessdate=2008-06-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408092628/http://www.hhs.gov/disasters/discussion/planners/conops.html |archivedate=2008-04-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first standard was ''1362-1998 - IEEE Guide for Information Technology - System Definition - Concept of Operations (ConOps) Document'' that was superseded by the document ''29148-2011 - ISO/IEC/IEEE International Standard - Systems and software engineering -- Life cycle processes --Requirements engineering''.
Then came the 2012 AIAA revision proposal ''Guide: Guide to the Preparation of Operational Concept Documents (ANSI/AIAA G-043A-2012) (Revision of G-043-1992)'', and today we have ''ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 Systems and software engineering -- System life cycle processes''.

In the field of joint [[military operations]], a CONOPS in [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] terminology is a verbal or graphic statement that clearly and concisely expresses what the joint force commander intends to accomplish and how it will be done using available resources.&lt;ref name="JP5-0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp5_0.pdf|title=Joint Publication 5-0; Joint Operation Planning|accessdate=2012-08-14|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903220959/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp5_0.pdf|archive-date=2012-09-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JP1-02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf|title=Joint Publication 1-02; Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms|accessdate=2012-08-14|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CONOPS may also be used or summarized in system acquisition [[DODAF]] descriptions such as the [[Operational_View#High-Level_Operational_Concept_Graphic|OV-1 High Level Operational Concept Graphic]]&lt;ref name="dodaf slides"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/DODAF/DoD_EA_Conf_SAR_DoDAF_in_Action.ppt|title=DODAF in Action|format=PPT}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Description==
Concept of Operations documents can be developed in many different ways, but usually share the same properties. In general, a CONOPS will include the following:&lt;ref name="carnegie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/productlines/ppl/concept_of_operations.html|title=Concept of Operations|year=2008|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Statement of the [[goal]]s and [[objective (goal)|objective]]s of the system
* [[Strategy|Strategies]], tactics, [[policy|policies]], and constraints affecting the system
* [[Organization]]s, activities, and interactions among participants and stakeholders
* Clear statement of [[Professional responsibility|responsibilities]] and [[authority|authorities]] delegated
* Specific [[Business operations|operational]] [[Business process|process]]es for fielding the system
* Processes for initiating, developing, maintaining, and retiring the system

A CONOPS should relate a [[narrative]] of the process to be followed in [[Implementation|implementing]] a system. It should define the roles of the stakeholders involved throughout the process. Ideally it offers clear [[methodology]] to realize the goals and objectives for the system, while not intending to be an implementation or transition plan itself.&lt;ref name="carnegie"/&gt;

A CONOPS Standard is available to guide the development of a CONOPS document.&lt;ref name="ieeestd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/se/1362-1998_desc.html|title=IEEE Std 1362-1998 IEEE Guide for Information Technology—System Definition—Concept of Operations (ConOps) Document|publisher=IEEE Standards Association|accessdate=2010-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=5966380
|title=IEEE Std 29148-2011 - Systems and software engineering -- Life cycle processes --Requirements engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) Standard is structured around [[information systems]], but the standard may be applied to other complex systems as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1500">'''Contractualism''' is a term in philosophy that refers either to a family of political theories in the [[social contract]] tradition (when used in this sense, the term is synonymous with  [[contractarianism]]),&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractarianism/&lt;/ref&gt; or to the ethical theory developed in recent years by [[T. M. Scanlon]], especially in his book ''What We Owe to Each Other''.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contractualism/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social contract]] theorists from the history of political thought include [[Hugo Grotius]] (1625), [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1651), [[Samuel Pufendorf]] (1673), [[John Locke]] (1689), [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1762), and [[Immanuel Kant]] (1797); more recently, [[John Rawls]] (1971), [[David Gauthier]] (1986) and [[Philip Pettit]] (1997).

In [[musical notation]], a '''cue note''' is or '''cue notes''' are indications informing [[musician|players]], "of important passages being played by other instruments, [such as an] '''entrance''' after a long period of [[rest (music)|rest]]."&lt;ref name="McGrain"&gt;McGrain, Mark (1990). ''Music Notation'', p.183. Hal Leonard. {{ISBN|9781476867052}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A cue may also function as a guideline for another instrument for [[musical improvisation]] or if there are many bars rest to help the performer find where to come in.

"Cue notes may be given as guidance only, to assist a performer's entrance after numerous measures of rest....[Their size, and all elements associated with them] is somewhat smaller than normal note size, but still large enough to be legible (65-75% of normal note size)."&lt;ref&gt;Gerou, Tom &amp; Lusk, Linda (1996). ''Essential Dictionary of Music Notation'', p.119. Alfred Music Publishing. {{ISBN|9781457410710}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cued instrument is indicated with text and the cue notes are smaller than the rest. The [[stem (music)|stems]] of cue notes all go in the same direction and cue notes are [[transposing instrument|transposed]] into the key of the part entering.&lt;ref name="McGrain"/&gt;

== Other definitions ==

There are also passages in certain scores where there is an indication above a line of notes saying "cue notes" or simply "cue", but this indication does not have anything to do with the "cue notes" explained above. Opposed to these, these "cue notes" are more like alternative notes, which can either be played or not played, depending on the conductor's decision. This practice is particularly common in recordings of orchestral film music, where they often like to try out several orchestral colors and weightings in just one recording session and therefore use cued passages to try out other options.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5004">'''Cybernetic art''' is [[contemporary art]] that builds upon the legacy of [[Cybernetics]], where feedback involved in the work take precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] and material concerns.

==History==
[[Nicolas Schöffer]]'s ''CYSP I'' (1956) was perhaps the first artwork to explicitly employ cybernetic principles (CYSP is an acronym that joins the first two letters of the words "CYbernetic" and "SPatiodynamic").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CYSP I, the first cybernetic sculpture of art's history|url=http://www.olats.org/schoffer/cyspe.htm|publisher=Leonardo/OLATS - Observatoire Leonardo des arts et des technosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist [[Roy Ascott]] elaborated an extensive theory of cybernetic art in  "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" (Cybernetica, Journal of the International Association for Cybernetics (Namur), Volume IX, No.4, 1966; Volume X No.1, 1967) and in "The Cybernetic Stance: My Process and Purpose" (Leonardo Vol 1, No 2, 1968). Art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] has written about the history of art and cybernetics in essays including "[http://www.artexetra.com//CyberneticsArtCultConv.pdf Cybernetics and Art: Cultural Convergence in the 1960s]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Energy to Information: Representation in Science, Technology, Art, and Literature|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|pages=255–277|editor=Bruce Clarke and Linda Dalrymple Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of [[Roy Ascott]]"(2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascott|first=Roy|title=Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|editor=Edward A. Shanken}}&lt;/ref&gt; which traces the trajectory of Ascott's work from cybernetic art to [[telematic art]] (art using computer networking as its medium, a precursor to [[net.art]].)

Audio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], for example, used "all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback in their respective of corresponding media."&lt;ref name="RA 07"&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott," in Roy Ascott (2003, 2007), ''Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness'', University of California, {{ISBN|0-520-22294-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With related work by Edward Ihnatowicz, [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] and cybernetician [[Gordon Pask]] and the animist kinetics of [[Robert Breer]] and [[Jean Tinguely]], the 1960s produced a strain of cyborg art that was very much concerned with the shared circuits within and between the living and the technological. A line of cyborg art theory also emerged during the late 1960s. Writers like Jonathan Benthall and [[Gene Youngblood]] drew on cybernetics and cybernetic. The most substantial contributors here were the British artist and theorist [[Roy Ascott]] with his essay "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in the journal Cybernetica (1976), and  the American critic and theorist [[Jack Burnham]]. In "Beyond Modern Sculpture" from 1968 he builds cybernetic art into an extensive theory that centers on art's drive to imitate and ultimately reproduce life.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Whitelaw (2004), ''Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life'', MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-23234-0}} p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading art theorists and historians in this field include [[Christiane Paul]], [[Frank Popper]], [[Christine Buci-Glucksmann]], [[Dominique Moulon]], [[Robert C. Morgan]], [[Roy Ascott]], [[Margot Lovejoy]], [[Edmond Couchot]], [[Fred Forest]] and [[Edward A. Shanken]].

'''DCAF''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|i|ˌ|k|æ|f}}; '''Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces'''; [[French language|French]]: ''Centre pour le contrôle démocratique des forces armées - Genève,'' [[German language|German]]: ''Genfer Zentrum für die demokratische Kontrolle der Streitkräfte'') is an intergovernmental [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]]-based [[think tank]]&lt;ref name="thinktank"/&gt; that provides research and project support to states and international actors in improving [[security sector governance and reform]] (SSG and SSR).

DCAF was established in 2000 in the [[Canton of Geneva]] by the [[Switzerland|Swiss government]] and as of 2018 employs around 170 staff, has seven permanent offices and 63 member states.

== Mandate ==
DCAF was established in October 2000 under [[Law of Switzerland|Swiss law]] as a foundation and on the initiative of the [[Switzerland|Swiss government]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=DCAF By-Laws (unofficial translation from French)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=Geneva|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization states that it is a [[good governance]]-promoting foundation focusing on a specific [[public sector]] area—the [[National security|security sector]]. DCAF is mandated by its intergovernmental Foundation Council to assist partner states and international actors in improving the governance of the security sector through [[reform]] based on international norms and good practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpplatform.ch/pbguide/organisation/geneva-centre-democratic-control-armed-forces-dcaf|title=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF) {{!}} GPPlatform|website=www.gpplatform.ch|access-date=2017-05-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824012946/http://www.gpplatform.ch/pbguide/organisation/geneva-centre-democratic-control-armed-forces-dcaf|archivedate=24 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
DCAF states that it provides in‐country advisory support and practical assistance programmes, identifies recommendations and good practices, develops and promotes norms and standards, and conducts tailored policy research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://studylib.net/doc/14926431/dcaf-strategy-2016-%E2%80%93-2019-dcaf-at-a-glance-adopted-by-dca...|title=DCAF Strategy 2016 – 2019|last=|first=|date=2015-06-09|website=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918202542/http://studylib.net/doc/14926431/dcaf-strategy-2016-%E2%80%93-2019-dcaf-at-a-glance-adopted-by-dca...|archive-date=18 September 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2017, DCAF supported national and international partners in more than 70 countries. The think tank reports that it collaborates with international organizations, such as the [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], the [[African Union]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) and the [[European Union]] (EU).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unog.ch/80256EE600583A0B/(httpPages)/C002F756C3E83A03C1257E3B004A21AA?OpenDocument|title=UNOG - DCAF Seminars|last=|first=|date=|website=unog.ch|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702093438/http://www.unog.ch/80256EE600583A0B/(httpPages)/C002F756C3E83A03C1257E3B004A21AA?OpenDocument|archive-date=2 July 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-05-28|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Database of Macromolecular Motions''' [http://www.molmovdb.org (molmovdb)] is a [[bioinformatics]] [[database]] and [[Software as a service|software-as-a-service]] tool that attempts to
categorize [[macromolecular]] motions, sometimes also known as [[conformational change]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hot Picks|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/284/5416/871.2|journal = Science|date = 1999-05-07|issn = 0036-8075|pages = 871–871|volume = 284|issue = 5416|doi = 10.1126/science.284.5416.871b|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=:3&gt;{{cite book |title= Structural Bioinformatics |veditors=Bourne PE, Helge W | year=2003 |location= Hoboken, NJ | publisher=Wiley-Liss | isbn= 978-0-471-20199-1 |oclc= 50199108|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bourne&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bourne,PE |author2=Murray-Rust, J |author3=Lakey JH |title=Protein-nucleic acid interactions Folding and binding Web alert  |journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology |volume=9 |issue= 1|pages=9–10 |date=Feb 1999|doi=10.1016/S0959-440X(99)90000-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally developed by [[Mark Bender Gerstein|Mark B.

== Discussion ==

Since its introduction in the late 1990s, peer-reviewed papers on the database have received thousands of citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mark Gerstein - Google Scholar Citations|url = https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YvjuUugAAAAJ|website = scholar.google.com|accessdate = 2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Werner G. Krebs - Google Scholar Citations|url = https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zVjmhJ8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en|website = scholar.google.com|accessdate = 2015-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database has been mentioned in news articles in major scientific journals,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bourne" /&gt; book chapters,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Users can search the database for a particular motion by either [[protein]] name or [[Protein Data Bank]] ID number.&lt;ref name=:1998&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerstein M, Krebs W |title=A database of macromolecular motions |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=26 |issue=18 |pages=4280–90 |date=September 1998 |pmid= 9722650|pmc=147832 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9722650 |doi=10.1093/nar/26.18.4280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, however, users will enter the database via the [[Protein Data Bank]], which often provides a hyperlink to the molmovdb entry for proteins found in both databases.

The database includes a web-based tool (the Morph server) which allows non-experts to animate and visualize certain types of protein [[conformational change]] through the generation of short movies. This system uses [[molecular modelling]] techniques to [[interpolate]] the structural changes between two different protein conformers and to generate a set of intermediate structures. A hyperlink pointing to the morph results is then emailed to the user.&lt;ref name="morph"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krebs WG, Gerstein M |title=SURVEY AND SUMMARY: The morph server: a standardized system for analyzing and visualizing macromolecular motions in a database framework |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=28 |issue=8 |pages=1665–75 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10734184 |pmc=102811 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10734184 |doi=10.1093/nar/28.8.1665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morph Server was originally primarily a research tool rather than general molecular animation tool, and thus offered only limited user control over rendering, animation parameters, color, and point of view, and the original methods sometimes required a fair amount of CPU time to completion.&lt;ref name=Maiti&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maiti R, Van Domselaar GH, Wishart DS |title=MovieMaker: a web server for rapid rendering of protein motions and interactions |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=33 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W358–62 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15980488 |pmc=1160245 |doi=10.1093/nar/gki485 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since their initial introduction in 1996, the database and associated morph server have undergone development to try to address some of these shortcomings&lt;ref name="updates"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16381870|pmc=1347409|title=The Database of Macromolecular Motions: new features added at the decade mark|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=34|issue=Database issue|pages=D296–301|year=2006|author1=Flores|first1=S|last2=Echols|first2=N|last3=Milburn|first3=D|last4=Hespenheide|first4=B|last5=Keating|first5=K|last6=Lu|first6=J|last7=Wells|first7=S|last8=Yu|first8=E.

'''Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute''' also referred to as '''Deccan College''' is a post-graduate institute of [[Archeology]], [[Linguistics]] and [[Sanskrit]] &amp; [[Lexicography]] [[Pune]], [[India]].

==History==
===Early years (1821 to 1939)===
Established on 6 October 1821 as Hindoo College, it is one of the oldest institutions of modern learning in India. It was started under [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] (Lt. Governor of [[Bombay Presidency]]), with funds diverted from the erstwhile Peshwa's Dakshina Fund, later disbursed by Sardar Khanderao Dabhade after the Territories of the [[Peshwa]] were annexed in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccancollegepune.ac.in/ Deccan College website]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also known as the Poona Sanskrit College. The first principal was Major [[Thomas Candy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazer|first1=James Nelson|title=Deccan College: a retrospect, 1851-1901|date=1902|publisher=The Author|location=Poona|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837, English and other modern subjects were added to the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;R.N. Dandekar, "Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar and the Academic Renaissance in Maharashtra" in ''Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute'', Vol. 69, No. 1/4 (1988), pp. 283-294.&lt;/ref&gt; An English school was added to the college in 1842; on 7 June 1851 the English school was merged with the Hindoo College to form [[Poona College]]. In 1857, the principal was Sir [[Edwin Arnold]], followed by W.A. Russell in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frazer|first1=James Nelson|title=Deccan College: a retrospect, 1851-1901|date=1902|publisher=The Author|location=Poona|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its original location in [[Vishrambaug Wada]] and later in [[Wanwadi]], the Poona College was shifted to its present large campus near Yerwada. The land was donated by the Bombay government. The foundation stone of the main building was laid on 15 October 1864. A [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian neo-Gothic]] building was constructed by Sir [[Henry Bartle Frere]] with a munificent 1,00,000 rupees from [[Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, 2nd Baronet]], between [[Kirkee]] and [[Yerwada]].

The college started functioning on the new campus on 23 March 1868. At this stage it was renamed as Deccan College in recognition of the enrollment of students from the entire [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region. Until 1881, Deccan College was staffed by four professors, one acting as principal. Another of the four, the professor of Oriental languages, supervised five traditional Sanskrit [[shastri]]s and an expert in Zend [[Pahlevi]] in an extensive program of research and text publication, in addition to his teaching duties.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen E. McDonald, "English Education and Social Reform in Late Nineteenth Century Bombay: A Case Study in the Transmission of a Cultural Ideal" in ''The Journal of Asian Studies'', Vol. 25, No. 3 (May, 1966), pp. 453-470.&lt;/ref&gt; Student enrollment rose to a peak of 210 in 1885. William Wordsworth (grandson of the poet [[William Wordsworth]]) and E.A. Wodehouse (brother of [[P.G. Wodehouse]]) were principals of the college during 1862-74 and 1934-39 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/A-golden-era-of-history-rusts-at-Deccan-college/articleshow/134146.cms | title=A golden era of history rusts at Deccan college | date=17 August 2003 | newspaper=The Times of India | first=Neil | last=Pate | accessdate=24 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history (1939 till present)===
Deccan College temporarily shut down its teaching activities in 1934 due to lack of funding. It was reopened by order of the [[Bombay High Court]] on 17 August 1939 as a post-graduate and research institute for promoting higher learning and research in [[Indology]] and [[Social Sciences]]. The re-opened institute originally had four teaching and research departments: Archaeology, Linguistics, History, and Sociology-Anthropology.

A Transfer Deed was passed by the Hon’ble Bombay High Court on 16 August 1939 by which the court enjoined the state government to run the institute in perpetuity. As per the Transfer Deed the Deccan College Poona Trust came into existence in which were vested the properties including the land and buildings. In accordance with the provision in the Transfer Deed, the appointments of the Trustees today are made by the State Government.

It was incorporated by the Poona University (now [[University of Pune]]) in 1948, becoming one of its recognized institutions.

The state government was entrusted with preparing the rules for the administration and management of the Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute, which was to cater to studies in post-graduate and research in heritage-related subjects. Thus the Management Council came into existence. In the next half-century the institute, apart from giving instruction to postgraduate students and producing over 500 Ph.D. dissertations, carried out outstanding research in Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology, Linguistics, Medieval and Maratha History, Sociology-Anthropology and Sanskrit Studies.

In recognition of the excellence achieved by the institute in teaching and research, the H.R.D. Ministry, Government of India, awarded it the status of a Deemed University on 5 March 1990. It started functioning as Deemed University from 1 June 1994. Since then the institute has conducted its own courses for M.A. degree and P.G. diploma in Archaeology, M.A. degree in Linguistics, and M.A. degree in Sanskrit and Lexicography, and has enrolled a large number of students for the Ph.D. degree in these disciplines.

Currently, Deccan College has only two teaching and research departments: Archaeology and Linguistics. On the premises are two museums: the Museum of Maratha History, and the Museum of Archaeology. As of 2016, it is currently involved in the ongoing multi-year excavation of the largest [[Indus Valley Civilization]] site of [[Rakhigarhi]] in [[Hisar district]] of [[Haryana]].

==Extra-academic==
Deccan College had the oldest boat club in India, called the Poonah Boat Club. The site has since been discontinued and is completely overrun by the slums behind Shadal Baba Dargah.&lt;ref&gt;Illustration 'India: The Poonah Boat Club: Bringing Down the Boats' in ''The Graphic'' (6 October 1877), p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4009">A '''diffuser''' is "a device for reducing the velocity and increasing the static pressure of a fluid passing through a system”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |chapter-url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diffuser.html |contribution=diffuser |title=Merriam–Webster Dictionary |accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diffusers are used to slow the fluid's velocity while increasing its static pressure. The fluid's static pressure rise as it passes though a duct is commonly referred to as pressure recovery.  In contrast, a [[nozzle]] is often intended to increase the discharge velocity and lower pressure while directing the flow in one particular direction.

Frictional effects during analysis can sometimes be important, but usually they are neglected. Ducts containing fluids flowing at low velocity can usually be analyzed using [[Bernoulli's principle]].  Analyzing ducts flowing at higher velocities with [[mach number]]s in excess of 0.3 usually require [[Compressible flow]] relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mach Number|url=https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/mach.html|website=NASA|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical, subsonic diffuser is a [[Duct (HVAC)|duct]] that increases in size in the direction of flow. As the duct increases in size, fluid velocity decreases, and static pressure rises. 
Both [[mass flow rate]] and [[Bernoulli's principle]] are responsible for these changes in pressure, and velocity.

==Supersonic Diffusers==

A supersonic diffuser is a duct that decreases in size in the direction of flow. As the duct decreases in size, fluid temperature, pressure, and density increase, while velocity decreases. [[Compressible flow]] is responsible for these changes in pressure, velocity, density, and temperature. [[Shock wave]]s may also play an important role in a supersonic diffuser.

== HVAC ==
[[Image:Central ventilation tube2.jpg|thumb|250px|A round diffuser in an HVAC system]]

Diffusers are very common in [[HVAC|heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;''Designer's Guide to Ceiling-Based Air Diffusion'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Diffusers are used on both all-air and air-water HVAC systems, as part of [[room air distribution]] subsystems, and serve several purposes:

* To deliver both conditioning and ventilating air
* Evenly distribute the flow of air, in the desired directions
* To enhance mixing of room air into the primary air being discharged
* Often to cause the air jet(s) to attach to a ceiling or other surface, taking advantage of the [[Coanda effect|Coandă effect]]
* To create low-velocity air movement in the occupied portion of room
* Accomplish the above while producing the minimum amount of [[noise]]

When possible, dampers, extractors, and other flow control devices should not be placed near diffusers' inlets (necks), either not being used at all or being placed far upstream.  They have been shown to dramatically increase noise production.  For as-cataloged diffuser performance, a straight section of [[duct (HVAC)|duct]] needs serve a diffuser.  An elbow, or kinked flex duct, just before a diffuser often leads to poor air distribution and increased noise.

Diffusers can be as a shape of round, rectangular,  or can be as linear slot diffusers(LSDs, e.g.: Linear slot diffusers takes the form of one or several long, narrow slots,mostly semi-concealed in a fixed or suspended ceiling.

Occasionally, diffusers are mostly used in reverse fashion, as air inlets or returns. This is especially true for Linear slot diffuser and 'perf' diffusers.  But more commonly, [[grille]]s are used as return or exhaust air inlets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10795">[[File:Dry river 2.jpg|thumb|A dried-up river in [[Ehrwald]]]]
An '''endangered river''' is one which has the potential to partly or fully dry up, or one that is thought to have [[ecology|ecological]] issues now or in the near future.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt; Some such issues are natural while others are the direct result of human development. Organisations including the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) have published lists of rivers at risk. The WWF's 2007 list featured the [[Danube]], the [[Nile]], and the [[Rio Grande]] amongst others, stating that these "once great rivers" are in danger and "can no longer be assured of reaching the sea unhindered".&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt; The US [[National Park Service]] reported in 2015 that part of the Rio Grande "often lies dry".&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Dangers may be the result of the natural change of conditions in the local environment but many are due to human development projects such as [[dam]]s and [[irrigation]]. Humans have also caused significant [[water pollution]] which endangers life which relies upon the water source.

==Importance==
According to the [[World Resources Institute]] (WRI) [[river basin]]s are "indispensable resources for billions of people, companies, farms, and ecosystems" but many suffer from "water stress". It states that numerous major rivers around the world have become depleted to the point that they can fail to reach their destinations.&lt;ref name="WRI14" /&gt; [[Water scarcity]] is a danger to all the life that depends on the source.

==Dangers to rivers==
[[File:Beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego.jpg|thumb|[[Beaver eradication in Tierra del Fuego|Beavers from North America constitute an invasive species]] in [[Tierra del Fuego]].]]
[[River]]s face many dangers, both natural and manmade. [[Climate change]] can have a significant impact on rivers, both positive and negative. This could be seen itself as an indirect result of human developments. An area which has a reduction in rainfall or an increase in temperature can make a river fully or partially dry out. This often means that the water can no longer reach its [[river mouth|mouth]].&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;

The [[flora]] and [[fauna]] of an area can face change and can have a substantial impact on landscape and local ecology.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt; [[Invasive species]] can move into an area or be introduced by humans. One particular example of the latter is the case of beavers being introduced into [[Tierra del Fuego]] in 1946. While only 20 animals were transplanted into the area they quickly reproduced with no natural predator to curb numbers. Their effect on the area, through the damaging gnawing of trees and the building of [[beaver dam|their dams]], has been significant enough that humans continue an attempt to undo their mistake with [[Beaver eradication in Tierra del Fuego|a program of beaver eradication]]. The ponds created by the beavers, which now number in the tens of thousands, have greatly contributed to the amount of organic matter retained by the rivers which then causes more problems downstream.&lt;ref name="SA14" /&gt;

===Specific human factors===
Human interference in the form of [[river engineering]] can redirect the flow of the water using [[dam]]s or channelisation.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt; The increasing demand from [[irrigation|irrigated]] agriculture, continued industrialisation, and residential use heavily impacts upon the health of river systems. This means that many areas face high levels of "baseline water stress".&lt;ref name="WRI14" /&gt; Rivers can be cut off from their [[floodplain]]s and their normal route can be changed or disrupted significantly. If improperly managed this can have a devastating effect on the surrounding area and endanger the plants and animals that depend on them, including humans. [[Water pollution]] is another artificial danger which can be a serious threat to wildlife and human health.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt; The [[Colorado River]] runs from the [[Rocky Mountain National Park]] in [[Colorado]] through four other states, parts of [[Mexico]], and then on to the [[Gulf of California]]. Due to the human demands for water very little reaches Mexico and what does is often polluted.&lt;ref name="MNNcol" /&gt; The [[Teesta River]] faces similar issues. The river flows through India and into Bangladesh, but India's water demands led to the part of the river in Bangladesh to dry up in 2018. If the situation continues it could be catastrophic for the local ecosystem.&lt;ref name="DT18" /&gt;

[[Image:Big Bend National Park - Rio Grande riverbed with cracked mud.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rio Grande]] occasionally runs dry in [[Big Bend National Park]].]]
The [[Rio Grande Project]] was an irrigation, [[hydroelectricity]], [[flood control]], and [[Interbasin transfer|interbasin water transfer]] project serving the upper [[Rio Grande]] basin in the southwestern United States. It was completed in 1952 and has had a significant impact on the surrounding area. In the past, the river was wide, deep and fast-flowing in its section through Texas, where it forms a large part of the [[Mexico – United States border]]. [[Illegal immigration to the United States|Illegal immigrants]] once had to swim across the river at the border, but with the river so low immigrants need only wade across for most of the year. After leaving [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] the Rio Grande often runs dry because so much water has been diverted away for human use.&lt;ref name="NPS" /&gt; Other than extensive diversions, exotic introduced, fast-growing and water-consuming plants, such as [[Eichhornia crassipes|water hyacinth]] and [[hydrilla]], are also leading to reduced flows. The United States government has recently attempted to slow or stop the progress of these weeds by [[Biological pest control|introducing]] insects and fish that feed on the invasive plants.&lt;ref name="bnet" /&gt;

==Reports==
[[File:Citarum River pollution, 2009.jpg|thumb|Pollution on the [[Citarum River]]]]
In 2014 a [[Channel 4]] report suggested that the [[Indonesia]]n [[Citarum River]], forty miles east of [[Jakarta]], may be the most polluted river in the world. Running from [[Wayang-Windu|Mount Wayang]] to the [[Java Sea]], there are over 30 million residents who rely on the river. Rapid [[industrialisation]] has had such a harmful effect that the river's surface cannot be seen for the waste and detritus floating on top of it.&lt;ref name="Teleg14" /&gt;

===World Wildlife Fund report===
The WWF published on their website the "10 Rivers most at Risk", a report from March 2007. They based their criteria on major rivers which already suffer or are particularly likely in the future to suffer from six key threats: dams and infrastructure, excessive water extraction, climate change, invasive species, over-fishing, and pollution. They noted that some of the greatest rivers "can no longer be assured of reaching the sea unhindered". The ten rivers which most concerned them are:&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;
{{columns-list|
*[[Salween River]]
*[[Río de la Plata|La Plata]]
*[[Danube]]
*[[Rio Grande]]
*[[Ganges]]
*[[Murray–Darling basin]]
*[[Indus River]]
*[[Nile]]
*[[Yangtze]]
*[[Mekong]]
}}

===American Rivers reports===
Each year [[American Rivers]] publishes a list containing ten of "America's Most Endangered Rivers". In 2018 its criteria focused on "threats [to rivers] from the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]]" and they selected the [[Sunflower River|Big Sunflower River]] as the one most endangered using their criteria. The river is one of the main [[tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Yazoo River]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Mississippi]] but is threatened by the Yazoo Backwater Area Pumping Plant project which they say has the potential to damage 200,000 acres of important [[wetland]].&lt;ref name="AR2018" /&gt;

===World Resources Institute project===
The World Resources Institute's Aqueduct project evaluated, mapped, and rated the state of the water supplies for 100 river basins in areas of high population. Their list highlighted the dangers to the [[Qom (River)|Qom River]], [[Yongding River]], [[Brantas River]], and [[Hari (Afghanistan)|Heray Rud River]] amongst others.&lt;ref name="WRI14" /&gt;

The '''environmental effect of pharmaceuticals and personal care products''' ('''PPCPs''') is currently being widely investigated. PPCPs include substances used by individuals for personal health or [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] reasons and the products used by [[agribusiness]] to boost growth or health of livestock. More than twenty million tons of PPCPs are produced every year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Jianlong|last2=Wang|first2=Shizong|title=Removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) from wastewater: A review|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|volume=182|pages=620–640|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.07.049|pmid=27552641|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPCPs have been detected in water bodies throughout the world. The effects of these [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] on humans and the environment are not yet known, but to date there is no scientific evidence that they affect human health.[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-epa-1|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Further research is needed to evaluate the risks of [[toxicity]], persistence, and [[bioaccumulation]]. PPCPs encompass [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s (EPPPs) and are one type of [[Persistent organic pollutant|persistent organic pollutants]]. They are not removed from wastewater by conventional methods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[European Union]] has declared [[Medication|pharmaceutical]] residues with the potential of contamination of water and soil to be "priority substances".[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-WFD2013-2|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

==Overview==
Since the 1990s, [[water contamination]] by pharmaceuticals has been an [[list of environmental issues|environmental issue]] of concern.&lt;ref name=Doerr-MacEwen&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doerr-MacEwen NA, Haight ME |title=Expert stakeholders' views on the management of human pharmaceuticals in the environment |journal=Environ Manage |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=853–66 |date=November 2006 |pmid=16955232 |doi=10.1007/s00267-005-0306-z |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it is important to note that many public health professionals in the United States began writing reports of pharmaceutical contamination in waterways in the 1970s.”&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Pharmaceuticals in drinking-water |date=2012 |publisher=World Health Organization |isbn=9789241502085 |location=Geneva, Switzerland |oclc=806494582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pharmaceuticals are deposited in the environment through human consumption and excretion, and are often filtered ineffectively by municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants which are not designed to manage them. Once in the water, they can have diverse, subtle effects on organisms, although research is still limited. Pharmaceuticals may also be deposited in the environment through improper disposal, runoff from [[sludge]] fertilizer and reclaimed wastewater irrigation, and leaky sewer pipes.&lt;ref name=Doerr-MacEwen/&gt; In 2009, an investigative report by [[Associated Press]] concluded that U.S. manufacturers had legally released 271 million pounds of compounds used as drugs into the environment, 92% of which was the industrial chemicals [[phenol]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]], which are also used as antiseptics. It could not distinguish between drugs released by manufacturers as opposed to the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. It also found that an estimated 250 million pounds of pharmaceuticals and contaminated packaging were discarded by hospitals and long-term care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Donn J. (2009). [https://www.usnews.com/articles/science/2009/04/19/tons-of-released-drugs-taint-us-water.html?PageNr=1 Tons of Released Drugs Taint U.S. Water]. AP.&lt;/ref&gt; The series of articles led to a hearing{{when|date=November 2018}} conducted by the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Transportation Safety, Infrastructure Security, and Water Quality. This hearing was designed to address the levels of pharmaceutical contaminants in U.S. drinking water. This was the first time that pharmaceutical companies were questioned about their waste disposal methods. "No federal regulations or laws were created as a result of the hearing."{{cn|date=November 2018}} "Between the years of 1970-2018 more than 3000 pharmaceutical chemicals were manufactured, but only 17 are screened or tested for in waterways."{{cn|date=November 2018}} Alternately, "There are no studies designed to examine the effects of pharmaceutical contaminated drinking water on human health.”&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In parallel, the [[European Union]] is the second biggest consumer in the world (24% of the world total) after the USA and in the majority of EU Member States, around 50% of unused human medicinal products is not collected to be disposed of properly. In the EU, between 30 and 90% of the orally administered doses are estimated to be excreted as the active substances in the urine.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/environment/study_environment.pdf  BIO Intelligence Service (2013), Study on the environmental risks of medicinal products, Final Report prepared for Executive Agency for Health and Consumers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s (EPPP) was suggested in the 2010 nomination of pharmaceuticals and environment as an emerging issue to [[Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management]] ([[SAICM]]) by the [[International Society of Doctors for the Environment]] (ISDE).

=== Safe disposal ===
Depending on the sources and ingredients, there are various ways in which the public can dispose of pharmaceutical and personal care products in acceptable ways. The most environmentally safe disposal method is to take advantage of a community drug take-back programs that collect drugs at a central location for proper disposal.  Several local public health departments in the United States have initiated these programs. In addition, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) periodically promotes local take-back programs, as well as the [[National Take Back Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Prescription Drug Take Back Day |url=http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drug_disposal/takeback/index.html |website=Office of Diversion Control |publisher=United States Drug Enforcement Administration |location=Springfield, Virginia |accessdate=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, take-back programs are funded by state or local health departments or are volunteer programs through pharmacies or health care providers. In recent years, the proposition that pharmaceutical companies should be responsible for their products “from the cradle to the grave,” has been gaining traction.  This philosophy suggests that the manufacturers should fund the proper disposal of pharmaceutical products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Long Battle for State Drug Take-Back Program Must Continue|url=http://www.theolympian.com/2011/03/13/1577405/long-battle-for-state-drug-take.html|accessdate=04/05/2011|newspaper=The Olympian|date=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Take-back programs should exist in every community, and, if further information is required on this, city officials should be contacted.&lt;ref&gt;

# take the prescription drugs out of their original containers
# mix drugs with [[Litter box|cat litter]] or [[used coffee grounds]]
# place the mixture into a disposable container with a lid, such as a sealable bag
# cover up any personal identification with a black marker that is on the original pill containers
# place these containers in the bag with the mixture, seal them, and place them in the trash.

This will hopefully keep these chemicals separated from the open environment and especially water bodies long enough for them to naturally break down.

When these substances find their way into water, it is much more difficult to deal with them. Water treatment facilities use different processes in order to minimize or fully eliminate these pollutants. This is done by using [[sorption]] where suspended solids are removed by [[sedimentation]].&lt;ref&gt;Siegrist, H., Ternes, T.A., Joss, A., (2004) Scrutinizing Pharmaceuticals and Personal 	Care 	Products in Wastewater Treatment Journal of Environmental Science &amp; Technology,38 392A-399A&lt;/ref&gt;  Another method used is [[biodegradation]], and through this method microorganisms, such as [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]], feed on or break down these pollutants thus eliminating them from the contaminated media.

[[Pharmaceutical drug|Pharmaceuticals]], or prescription and over-the-counter medications made for human use or veterinary or agribusiness purposes, are common PPCPs found in the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are nine classes of pharmaceuticals included in PPCPs: [[hormone]]s, [[antibiotics]], [[Clofibrate|lipid regulators]], [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s, [[Beta blocker|beta-blockers]], [[antidepressant]]s, [[anticonvulsant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[antineoplastics]], and diagnostic contrast media.&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Personal care|Personal care products]] have four classes: [[fragrances]], [[preservative]]s, [[disinfectant]]s, and [[Octocrylene|sunscreen agents]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These products may be found in cosmetics, perfumes, menstrual care products, lotions, shampoos, soaps, toothpastes, and sunscreen. These products typically enter the environment when passed through or washed off the body and into the ground or sewer lines, or when disposed of in the trash, septic tank, or sewage system.[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-epa-1|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Traces of illicit drugs can be found in waterways and may even be carried by money.[[Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products#cite note-11|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

== Routes into the environment ==

More attention has been devoted of late to PPCPs in the environment. Two causes may contribute to this: PPCPs are actually increasing in the environment due to widespread use and/or analytical technology is better able to detect PPCPs in the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These substances enter the environment directly or indirectly. Direct methods include contamination of surface water by hospitals, households, industries, or wastewater treatment plants. Direct contamination can also affect the sediment and soil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is generally assumed (albeit hardly verified) that the production of pharmaceuticals in industrialised countries is well controlled and unharmful to the environment, due to the local legal restrictions usually required to permit production. However, a substantial fraction of the global production of pharmaceuticals takes place in low-cost production countries like India and China. Recent reports from India demonstrate that such production sites may emit very large quantities of e.g. antibiotics, yielding levels of the drugs in local surface waters higher than those found in the blood of patients under treatment.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu" /&gt;

The major route for pharmaceutical residues to reach the aquatic environment is most probably by excretion from patients undergoing pharma treatment. Since many pharmaceutical substances are not metabolized in the body they may be excreted in biologically active form, usually via the urine. Furthermore, many pharmaceutical substances are not fully taken up from the intestine (following oral administration in patients) into their blood stream. The fraction not taken up into the blood stream will remain in the gut and eventually be excreted via the faeces. Hence, both urine and faeces from treated patients contain pharmaceutical residues. Between 30 and 90% of the orally administered dose is generally excreted as active substance in the urine.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu" /&gt;

An additional source to environmental pollution with pharmaceuticals is improper disposal of unused or expired drug residues. In European countries take-back systems for such residues are usually in place (although not always utilized to full extent) while in e.g. the US only voluntary initiatives on a local basis exist. Though most of the waste goes to incineration and people are asked to throw unused or expired pharmaceuticals into the household waste investigations in Germany showed that up to 24% of liquid pharmaceuticals and 7% of tablets or ointments are disposed always or at least “rarely” via the toilet or sink.&lt;ref name="no-pills.eu" /&gt;

Proper destruction of pharma residues should yield rest products without any pharmaceutical or ecotoxic activity. Furthermore, the residues should not act as components in the environmental formation of new such products. Incineration at a high temperature (&gt;1000 degrees Celsius) is considered to fulfill the requirements, but even following such incineration residual ashes from the incineration should be properly taken care of.

Pharmaceuticals used in veterinary medicine, or as additives to animal food, pose a different problem, since they are excreted into soil or possibly open surface waters. It is well known that such excretions may affect terrestrial organisms directly, leading to extinction of exposed species (e.g. dung-beetles). Lipid-soluble pharma residues from veterinary use may bind strongly to soil particles, with little tendency to leak out to ground water or to local surface waters. More water-soluble residues may be washed out with rain or melting snow and reach both ground water and surface water streams.

{{details|topic=how pollutants enter the environment through the manufacturing of PPCPs|Industrial ecology}}
The use of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is on the rise with an estimated increase from 2&amp;nbsp;billion to 3.9&amp;nbsp;billion annual prescriptions between 1999 and 2009 in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tong|first=A.Y.|author2=Peake, B. |author3=Braund, R. |title=Disposal practices for unused medications around the world|journal=Environment International|year=2011|volume=37|issue=1|pages=292–298|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2010.10.002|pmid=20970194}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPCPs enter into the environment through individual human activity and as residues from manufacturing, agribusiness, [[veterinary]] use, and [[hospital]] and community use. In Europe, the input of pharmaceutical residues via domestic waste water is estimated to be around 80% whereas 20% is coming from hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pills-project.eu/PILLS_summary_english.pdf EU project report summary "Pharmaceutical Input and Elimination from Local Sources", 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals may add PPCPs to the environment through waste excretion and bathing as well as by directly disposing of unused medications to [[septic tanks]], [[Sewerage|sewers]], or trash.  Because PPCPs tend to dissolve relatively easily and do not evaporate at normal temperatures, they often end up in soil and water bodies.

Some PPCPs are broken down or processed easily by a human or animal body and/or degrade quickly in the environment . However, others do not break down or degrade easily. The likelihood or ease with which an individual substance will break down depends on its chemical makeup and the metabolic pathway of the compound.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epa.gov/ppcp |title=Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012 |website= |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location= Washington, D.C. |access-date=2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 study by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] found detectable quantities of one or more chemicals in 80 percent of a sampling of 139 susceptible streams in 30 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://toxics.usgs.gov/pubs/FS-027-02/ |title=Pharmaceuticals, Hormones, and Other Organic Wastewater Contaminants in U.S. Streams |last1=Buxton |first1=H.T. |last2=Kolpin |first2=D.W. |date=June 2002 |website= |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |series=USGS Fact Sheet FS-027-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common pharmaceuticals detected were  nonprescription drugs; [[detergents]], [[fire retardant]]s, [[pesticides]], natural and synthetic [[hormones]], and an assortment of [[antibiotics]] and [[prescription medication]]s were also found.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.groundwater.org/gi/ppcp_about.html Pharmaceutical and Personal Care Products in Drinking Water Supplies.]"  The Groundwater Foundation.

A 2006 study found detectable concentrations of 28 pharmaceutical compounds in sewage treatment plant effluents, surface water, and sediment. The therapeutic classes included [[antibiotics]], [[analgesics]] and anti-inflammatories, [[lipid]] regulators, [[beta-blockers]], [[anti-convulsant]], and [[steroid hormones]].

==Effects==

===Human===
The scope of human exposure to pharmaceuticals and personal care products from the environment is a complex function of many factors. These factors include the concentrations, types, and distribution of pharmaceuticals in the environment; the pharmacokinetics of each drug; the structural transformation of the chemical compounds either through metabolism or natural degradation processes; and the potential bioaccumulation of the drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Daughton |first=C.G. |title=Pharmaceuticals as Environmental Pollutants: the Ramifications for Human Exposure |journal=International Encyclopedia of Public Health |year=2008 |volume=5 |pages=66–122 |doi=10.1016/b978-012373960-5.00403-2 |isbn=9780123739605}}&lt;/ref&gt; More research is needed to determine the effects on humans of long-term exposure to low levels of PPCPs.  The full effects of mixtures of low concentrations of different PPCPs is also unknown.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.drinktap.org/consumerdnn/Default.aspx?tabid=73 Pharmaceuticals and personal care products in drinking water]."  American Water Works Association. Accessed 20 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The U.S. EPA risk assessment states that the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of pharmaceuticals is around 0.0027 mg/kg‐day."{{cn|date=November 2018}} Due to the lack of research of toxicity guidelines and their effects on human health it is difficult to determine a healthy dosage for water contaminated by pharmaceuticals. "The pharmaceutical sample size tested does not give a full representation of human exposure. Only 17 out of 3000 prescriptions are screened for in drinking water."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In addition, “The EPA and FDA regulations state that a drug or chemical is not considered harmful until clear evidence shows that  a substance causes harm".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Snyder |first=Shane |date=November 201 0|title=Pharmaceuticals in the Water Environment |url=https://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/policy/acsonthehill/briefings/pharmaceuticalsinwater/nacwa-paper.pdf |journal=Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies |volume=|pages=38|via=American Chemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that we are not testing or screening for thousands of contaminants in our drinking water. Health risk assessments have not been conducted to provide concrete evidence to link pharmaceutical contamination and adverse human health effects.

"However adverse health outcomes are displayed in aquatic organisms. Fish living near water treatment plants have been reported to be feminized."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; "Some male fish started to develop ovaries and other feminized characteristic due to pharmaceutical pollution some species have decreased in population due to exposure of EE2 and other hormonal ECD substances."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Although research has shown that PPCPs are present in water bodies throughout the world, no studies have shown a direct effect on human health. However, the absence of empirical data cannot rule out the possibility of adverse outcomes due to interactions or long-term exposures to these substances. Because the amounts of these chemicals in the water supply may be in the parts per trillion or parts per billion, it is difficult to chemically determine the exact amounts present. Many studies&lt;ref name="Daughton 2008 66–102"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Daughton |first=C.G. |title=Pharmaceuticals as Environmental Pollutants: the Ramifications for Human Exposure |journal=International Encyclopedia of Public Health |year=2008 |volume=5 |pages=66–102 |doi=10.1016/b978-012373960-5.00403-2 |isbn=9780123739605}}&lt;/ref&gt; have therefore been focused to determining if the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals exist at or above the accepted daily intake (ADI) at which the designed biological outcomes can occur.&lt;ref name="Daughton 2008 66–102"/&gt;

In addition to the growing concerns about human health risks from pharmaceutical drugs via environmental exposures, many researchers have speculated about the potential for inducing an antibiotic resistance. One study found 10 different antibiotics in sewage treatment effluents, surface water, and sediments.&lt;ref name="Hernando 2006 334–342"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hernando |first=M.D. |author2=Mezcua, M. |author3=Fernández-Alba, AR. |author4=Barceló, D. |title=Environmental Risk Assessment of Pharmaceutical Residues in Wastewater Effluents, Surface Waters and Sediments |journal=Talanta |year=2006 |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=334–342 |doi=10.1016/j.talanta.2005.09.037|pmid=18970571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some microbiologists believe that if antibiotic concentrations are higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of a species of pathogenic bacteria, a selective pressure would be exerted and, as a result, antibiotic resistance would be selectively promoted. It has also been proven that at even sub-inhibitory concentrations (e.g., one-fourth of the MIC), several antibiotics are able to have an effect on gene expression (e.g., as shown for the modulation of expression of toxin-encoding genes in Staphylococcus aureus).&lt;ref name="Segura 2005 675–684"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Segura |first=P.A. |author2=Francois, M. |author3=Gagnon, C. |author4=Sauve, S. |title=Review of the Occurrence of Anti-infectives in Contaminated Wastewaters and Natural and Drinking Waters |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=May 2005 |volume=117 |issue=5 |pages=675–684 |doi=10.1289/ehp.11776 |pmid=19479007 |pmc=2685827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For reference the MIC of erythromycin that is effective against 90 percent of lab grown Campylobacter bacteria, the most common food-borne pathogen in the United States, is 60&amp;nbsp;ng/mL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Modolo |first1=J.R. |last2=Giuffrida |first2=R. |last3=de M. Lopes |first3=C.R. |title=Antimicrobial Susceptibility of 51 Campylobacter Strains Isolated From Diarrheic and Diarrhea-Free Dogs |journal=Arquivos do Instituto Biológic. |date=July 2003 |volume=70 |issue=3|pages=283–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that the average concentration of erythromycin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, was 0.09&amp;nbsp;ng/mL in water treatment plant effluents,.&lt;ref name="Hernando 2006 334–342"/&gt; Additionally, transfer of genetic elements among bacteria has been observed under natural conditions in wastewater treatment plants, and selection of resistant bacteria has been documented in sewers receiving wastewaters from pharmaceutical plants.&lt;ref name="Segura 2005 675–684"/&gt; Moreover, antibiotic resistant bacteria may also remain in sewage sludge and enter the food chain if the sludge is not incinerated but used as fertilizer on agricultural land.&lt;ref name="no-pills.eu"/&gt;

The relationship between risk perception and behavior is multifaceted.  Risk management is most effective once the motivation behind the behavior of disposing unused pharmaceuticals is understood.  There was little correlation found between the perception of risk and knowledge regarding pharmaceutical waste according to a study conducted by Cook and Bellis in 2001.&lt;ref name="Cook 2001"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Bellis|title=Knowing the risk: relationships between behaviour and health knowledge.  Public Health 115, 54-61|publisher=Public Health|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study cautioned against the effectiveness of attempting to change the public’s behavior on these health issues by warning them of the risks associated with their actions.&lt;ref name="Cook 2001"/&gt;

It is advised to take careful measures to inform the public in a way that does not impart guilt but rather public awareness.  For example, a study carried out by Norlund and Garvill in Sweden (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordlund|first=A.M.|title=Effects of values, problem awareness, and personal norm on willingness to reduce personal car use|publisher=J. Environment Psychol.|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that found that some people may make a personal sacrifice in terms of comfort because they feel that it would be helpful to reduce further environmental damage caused by the use of cars.  Awareness of air pollution problems was a factor in their decision to take action on a more environmentally favorable choice of transportation.  Thus, the goal of Bound’s project encapsulates whether the perception of risk associated with pharmaceuticals has an effect on the way in which medication is commonly disposed.

In order to conduct this study, the pharmaceuticals were grouped by their therapeutic action in order to help participants identify them.  The eight therapeutic groups are listed below: [[antibacterials]], [[antidepressants]], [[antihistamines]], [[antiepileptics]], [[hormone]] treatments, and [[lipid]] regulators.  Next, a survey was created to examine the disposal patterns of the participants and their perception of the existing risk or threat against the environment.  Respondents were asked the following questions in part one of the survey: 1. When and how they disposed of pharmaceuticals. 2. How they perceive the risk to the environment posed by pharmaceuticals. 3. To differentiate between the risks associated with different classed of pharmaceuticals.  Part two of the survey involved each of the eight pharmaceutical groups described above individually. Finally, the third part asked information about the age, sex, profession, postcode, and education of participants.  The sample size of participants was precise in comparison to the actual distribution of males and females in the UK: Sample- 54.8 percent were female and 45.2 percent male vs. Actual- the UK of 51.3 percent female to 48.7 percent male.  Results showed that when a medication must be discarded, 63.2 percent of participants throw them in a bin, 21.8 percent return them to a pharmacist, and 11.5 percent dispose of them via the toilet/sink, while the remaining 3.5 percent keep them.  Only half of the respondents felt like pharmaceuticals could potentially be harmful to the environment.  Upon examination of factors relevant to risk perception, there was no definite link found between perception and education or income.

Dr. Bound noted that participation in altruistic activities such as Environmental Conservation groups may provide members with the ability to better grasp the effects of their actions in the environment.  In regards to the aquatic environment, it is hard for one to perceive the favorable effects of properly disposing medication.  There also exists the plausibility that a person’s behavior will only be affected if there is a severe risk to themselves or humans as opposed to an environmental threat.  Even though there are serious threats of pharmaceutical pollution resulting in the feminization of certain fish, they have a lower priority because they are not easily understood or experienced by the general public.  In Jonathan P. Bound’s opinion, the provision of information about exactly how to go about disposing unused medication properly in conjunction with risk education may have a more positive and forceful effect.

=== Recommendations ===
Several recommendations and initiatives have been made to prevent pharmaceutical pollution in the environment.  Important practices include educating patients on the importance of proper unused drug disposal, educating physicians and patients of proper drug disposal, encouraging pharmaceutical industries to implement strategies for proper disposal of drugs or recycling strategies, and enforcing hospitals to implement better management practices for disposing pharmaceutical waste.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhati|first=Itishri|date=Dec 2013|title=Greener Route to Prevent Pharmaceutical Pollution|url=http://ijpcsonline.com/files/23-674.pdf|journal=International Journal of Pharmaceutical and Chemical Sciences|volume= 2 |issue= 4|pages=7|via=IJPCS Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, it is imperative that patients become educated on pharmaceutical pollution and its hazardous effects on humans, animals, and the overall environment.  By educating patients on proper disposal of unused drugs, steps are being taken to further prevent pharmaceutical waste in the environment.  Consumers should take precautions before tossing out drugs in the trash or flushing them down the toilet.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srivastava|first=Bhavana|date=2014-05-25|title=Drug disposal and environmental concern|url=http://jddt.in/index.php/jddt/article/view/192|journal=Journal of Drug Discovery and Therapeutics|language=en|volume=2|issue=17|issn=2320-4230}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Community take back programs have been set up for consumers to bring back unused drugs for proper disposal.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Another initiative is for pharmacies to serve as a take back site for proper drug disposal such as implementing recycling bins for customers to bring back unused or expired medicines while they’re shopping.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In addition, educating physicians and patients on the importance of proper drug disposal and the environmental concern will help further reduce pharmaceutical waste.

Also, implementing initiatives for hospitals to focus on better practices for hazardous waste disposal may prove to be beneficial.  The US EPA incentives hospitals to develop efficient pharmaceutical disposal practices by giving them grants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  This incentive may be very beneficial to other hospitals worldwide.

Additionally, “It is critical for us to develop an analytical method of identifying, testing, and regulating the amount of pharmaceuticals in the water systems”.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Data must be collected in order to accurately measure the prevalence of pharmaceuticals in drinking water. “Multiple Health risk assessments should be conducted to understand the effects of prolonged exposure to pharmaceuticals in drinking water”.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Community based programs should be developed to monitor exposure and health outcomes.  We should encourage the pharmaceutical industry to develop technology that extracts pharmaceutical contains form waterways. “Extensive research must be conducted to determine the amount of pharmaceutical contamination in the environment and its effects on  animals and marine life”.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

===Environmental===
While the full effects of most PPCPs on the environment are not understood, there is concern about the potential they have for harm because they may act unpredictably when mixed with other chemicals from the environment or concentrate in the food chain. Additionally, some PPCPs are active at very low concentrations, and are often released continuously in large or widespread quantities.

Because of the high solubility of most PPCPs, aquatic organisms are especially vulnerable to their effects.  Researchers have found that a class of antidepressants may be found in frogs and can significantly slow their development.{{mcn|date=September 2015}}  The increased presence of estrogen and other synthetic hormones in waste water due to birth control and hormonal therapies has been linked to increased feminization of exposed fish and other aquatic organisms.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.campusecology.wsu.edu/page_055.htm Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products in the Environment]."

In addition to being found only in waterways, the ingredients of some PPCPs can also be found in the soil. Since some of these substances take a long time or cannot be degraded biologically, they make their way up the food chain.{{mcn|date=September 2015}} Information pertaining to the transport and fate of these hormones and their metabolites in dairy waste disposal is still being investigated, yet research suggest that the land application of solid wastes is likely linked with more hormone contamination problems.&lt;ref&gt;Zheng, W., Yates, S.R., Bradford, S.A.

There are various concerns about the effects of pharmaceuticals found in surface waters and specifically the threats against rainbow trout exposed to treated sewage effluents.  Analysis of these pharmaceuticals in the blood plasma of fish compared to human therapeutic plasma levels have yielded vital information providing a means of assessing risk associated with medication waste in water.  In a study by Dr. Jerker Fick from [[Umeå University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fick |first=Jerker |title=Therapeutic Levels of Levonorgestrel Detected in Blood Plasma of Fish: Results from Screening Rainbow Trout Exposed to Treated Sewagae Effluents |publisher=Evniron.

They were exposed for a total of 14 days while 25 pharmaceuticals were measured in the blood plasma at different levels for analysis.  The [[progestin]] Levonorgestrel was detected in fish blood plasma at concentrations between 8.5 and 12&amp;nbsp;ng mL-1 which exceed the human therapeutic plasma level.  Studies show that the measured effluent level of Levonorgestrel in the three areas was shown to reduce the fertility of the rainbow trout.{{Primary source inline|date=September 2015}}

The three sites chosen for field exposures were in located in Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Umeå.  They were chosen according to their varying degrees of treatment technologies, geographic locations, and size.  The effluent treatment includes active sludge treatment, nitrogen and phosphorus removal (except in Umeå), primary clarification, and secondary clarification.  Juvenile rainbow trout were procured from Antens fiskodling AB, Sweden and Umlax AB, Sweden.  The fish were exposed to aerated, undiluted, treated effluent.  Since all of the sites underwent sludge treatment, it can be inferred that they are not representative of the low end of treatment efficacy. Of the 21 pharmaceuticals that were detected in the water samples, 18 were identified in the effluent, 17 in the plasma portion, and 14 pharmaceuticals were found in both effluent and plasma.{{Primary source inline|date=September 2015}}

There are traces pharmaceuticals in waterways that have an adverse effect on the environment. 
]]
Starting in the mid-1960s, ecologists and toxicologists began to express concern about the potential adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in the water supply, but it wasn’t until a decade later that the presence of pharmaceuticals in water was well documented. Studies in 1975 and 1977 found [[clofibric]] acids and [[salicylic acid]]s at trace concentrations in treated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snyder |first1=S. |last2=Westerhoff |first2=P.|last3=Yoon|first3=Y.|last4=Sedlak|first4=D.|title=Pharmaceuticals, Personal Care Products, and Endocrine Disruptors in Water: Implications for the Water Industry |journal=Environmental Engineering Science |year=2003 |volume=20 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread concern about and research into the effect of [[PPCP]]s largely started in the early 1990s.  Until this time, PPCPs were largely ignored because of their relative solubility and containment in waterways compared to more familiar pollutants like [[agrochemicals]], industrial chemicals, and [[industrial waste]] and byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Ce-Cr/Chemicals-from-Pharmaceuticals-and-Personal-Care-Products.html Chemicals from Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products]."  Water Encyclopedia.  Accessed 20 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, a great deal of attention has been directed to the ecological and physiological risk associated with pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites in water and the environment. In the last decade, most research in this area has focused on [[steroid hormones]] and antibiotics. There is concern that steroid hormones may act as [[endocrine disruptor]]s. Some research suggests that concentrations of [[ethinylestradiol]], an estrogen used in oral contraceptive medications and one of the most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals, can cause endocrine disruption in aquatic and amphibian wildlife in concentrations as low as 1&amp;nbsp;ng/L.&lt;ref name="Daughton 2008 66–102" /&gt;

Current research on PPCPs aims to answer these questions:&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.groundwater.org/gi/docs_pack/fa13.pdf Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products: An Emerging Issue]."  The Groudwater Foundation.  Accessed 20 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmacoenvironmentology===
Pharmacoenvironmentology is an extension of pharmacovigilance as it deals specifically with the environmental and ecological effects of drugs given at therapeutic doses.&lt;ref name="Rahman 20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Syed Ziaur|last2=Khan|first2=Rahat Ali|last3=Gupta|first3=Varun|last4=Uddin|first4=Misbah|date=2007-07-24|title=Pharmacoenvironmentology – a component of pharmacovigilance|journal=Environmental Health|volume=6|pages=20|doi=10.1186/1476-069x-6-20|pmid=17650313|pmc=1947975|issn=1476-069X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmacologists with this particular expertise (known as a pharmacoenvironmentologist) become a necessary component of any team assessing different aspects of drug safety in the environment.&lt;ref name="Rahman 20" /&gt; We must look at the effects of drugs not only in medical practice, but also at its environmental effects. Any good clinical trial should look at the impact of particular drugs on the environment. Things we need to address in pharmacoenvironmentology are drugs and their exact concentration in different parts of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Medhi|first=Bikash|last2=Sewal|first2=RakeshK|date=2012-09-01|title=Ecopharmacovigilance: An issue urgently to be addressed|url=http://www.ijp-online.com/text.asp?2012/44/5/547/100363|journal=Indian Journal of Pharmacology|language=en|volume=44|issue=5|pages=547–9|doi=10.4103/0253-7613.100363|pmid=23112410|pmc=3480781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmacoenvironmentology is a specific domain of pharmacology and not of environmental studies.This is because it deals with drugs entering through living organisms through elimination.&lt;ref name="Rahman 20" /&gt;

===Ecopharmacovigilance===
Pharmacovigilance is a new branch of science, which was born in 1960 after the incidence of the thalidomide disaster. Thalidomide is a teratogen and caused horrific birth abnormalities. The thalidomide disaster lead to the present day approach to drug safety and adverse event reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dally|first=Ann|title=Thalidomide: was the tragedy preventable?|journal=The Lancet|volume=351|issue=9110|pages=1197–1199|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(97)09038-7|pmid=9643709|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the EPA, pharamacovigilance is science aiming to capture any adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in humans after use. However, ecopharmacovigilance is  the science, and activities concerning detection, assessment, understanding, and prevention of adverse effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment which affect humans and other animal species.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There has been a growing focus among scientists about the impact of drugs on the environment.  In recent years, we have been able to see human pharmaceuticals that are being detected in the environment which most are typically found on surface water.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The importance of ecopharmacovigilance is to monitor adverse effects of pharmaceuticals on humans through environmental exposure.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Due to this relatively new field of science, researchers are continuously developing and understanding the impacts of pharmaceuticals in the environment and its risk on human and animal exposure. Environmental risk assessment is a regulatory requirement in the launch of any new drug.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  This precaution has become a necessary step towards the understanding and prevention of adverse effects of pharmaceutical residue in the environment.  It is important to note that pharmaceuticals enter the environment from the excretion of drugs after human use, hospitals, and improper disposal of unused drugs from patients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Ecopharmacology===
Ecopharmacology concerns the entry of chemicals or drugs into the environment through any route and at any concentration disturbing the balance of ecology (ecosystem), as a consequence. Ecopharmacology is a broad term that includes studies of “PPCPs” irrespective of doses and route of entry into environment.&lt;ref name="Ilene Sue Ruhoy 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sue Ruhoy|first1=Ilene|last2=Daughton|first2=Christian G.|year=2008|title=Beyond the medicine cabinet: An analysis of where and why medications accumulate|url=|journal=Environment International|volume=34|issue=8|pages=1157–1169|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2008.05.002|pmid=18571238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Hashemi| first= Zahra | authorlink = | year = 2008 | title = An Introduction to Environmental Pharmacology | chapter = Addendum: Terminologies related to Drug Safety | editor = Rahman SZ, Shahid M &amp; Gupta A | others = | edition = 1st | pages = 257–259| publisher = [[Ibn Sina Academy of Medieval Medicine and Sciences]]| location = Aligarh | isbn = 978-81-906070-4-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://www.ehjournal.net/content/6/1/20| doi= 10.1186/1476-069X-6-20| last=Rahman| first=SZ| last2= Khan | first2=RA| last3=Gupta| first3=V| last4= Uddin | first4=Misbah| title= Pharmacoenvironmentology–A Component of Pharmacovigilance | journal= Environmental Health |date=July 2007| volume= 6 | issue=20| page= 20| pmid= 17650313  | pmc=1947975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The geology of a karst aquifer area assists with the movement of PPCPs from the surface to the ground water. Relatively soluble bedrock creates sinkholes, caves and sinking streams into which surface water easily flows, with minimal filtering.  Since 25% of the population get their drinking water from karst aquifers, this affects a large number of people.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dodgen|first=L.K.|last2=Kelly|first2=W.R.|last3=Panno|first3=S.V.|last4=Taylor|first4=S.J.|last5=Armstrong|first5=D.L.|last6=Wiles|first6=K.N.|last7=Zhang|first7=Y.|last8=Zheng|first8=W.|title=Characterizing pharmaceutical, personal care product, and hormone contamination in a karst aquifer of southwestern Illinois, USA, using water quality and stream flow parameters|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=578|pages=281–289|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.103|pmid=27836351|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2016 study of karst aquifers in southwest Illinois found that 89% of water samples had one or more PPCP measured. Triclocarban (an antimicrobial) was the most frequently detected PPCP, with gemfibrozil (a cardiovascular drug) the second most frequently detected.  Other PPCPs detected were trimethoprim, naproxen, carbamazepine, caffeine, sulfamethoxazole, and fluoxetine. The data suggests that septic tank effluent is a probable source of PPCPs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Fate of pharmaceuticals in sewage treatment plants ===

[[File:Pipes of the Minsk sewage treatment plant - 3.jpg|thumb|316x316px|
[[Sewage treatment plants]] use physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove [[nutrients]] and contaminants from waste water.]]
[[Sewage treatment plants]] (STP) work with physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove [[nutrients]] and contaminants from waste water. Usually the STP is equipped with an initial mechanical separation of solid particles (cotton buds, cloth, hygiene articles etc.) appearing in the incoming water. Following this there may be filters separating finer particles either occurring in the incoming water or developing as a consequence of chemical treatment of the water with flocculating agents.

Many STPs also include one or several steps of biological treatment. By stimulating the activity of various strains of microorganisms physically their activity may be promoted to degrade the organic content of the sewage by up to 90% or more. In certain cases more advanced techniques are used as well. The today most commonly used advanced treatment steps especially in terms of micropollutants are

*[[Membrane technology|membrane]]s (which may be used instead of the biological treatment),
*[[ozone|ozonation]],
*[[activated carbon]] (powdered or granulated),
*[[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation|UV treatment]],
* treatment with [[Ferrate(VI)|ferrate]] and
*[[Slow sand filter|sand filtration]] (which is sometimes added as a last step after the aforementioned).

PPCPs are difficult to remove from wastewater with conventional methods. Some research shows the concentration of such substances is even higher in water leaving the plant than water entering the plant. Many factors including environmental pH, seasonal variation, and biological properties affect the ability of a STP to remove PPCPs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2013 study of a drinking water treatment plant, found that of 30 PPCPs measured at both the source water and the drinking water locations, 76% of PPCPs were removed, on average, in the water treatment plant. Ozonation was found to be an efficient treatment process for the removal of many PPCPs.  However, there are some PPCPs that were not removed, such as DEET used as mosquito spray, nonylphenol which is a surfactant used in detergents, the antibiotic erythromycin, and the herbicide atrazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Padhye|first=Lokesh P.|last2=Yao|first2=Hong|last3=Kung'u|first3=Francis T.|last4=Huang|first4=Ching-Hua|title=Year-long evaluation on the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and endocrine disrupting chemicals in an urban drinking water treatment plant|journal=Water Research|volume=51|pages=266–276|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2013.10.070|pmid=24262763|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several research projects are running to optimize the use of advanced sewage treatment techniques under different conditions. The advanced techniques will increase the costs for the sewage treatment substantially.
In a European cooperation project between 2008 and 2012 in comparison 4 hospital waste water treatment facilities were developed in [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[The Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]] to investigate the elimination rates of concentrated waste water with pharmaceutical “cocktails” by using different and combined advanced treatment technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pills-project.eu/ |title=The PILLS Project |website=www.pills-project.eu |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially the German STP at Marienhospital [[Gelsenkirchen]] showed the effects of a combination of membranes, ozone, powdered activated carbon and sand filtration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GeQyqO9KEI |title=noPILLS Emschergenossenschaft Gelsenkirchen (Marienhospital)|last=EGLV Emschergenossenschaft/ Lippeverband|date=24 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2017 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even a maximum of installed technologies could not eliminate 100% of all substances and especially [[radiocontrast agent]]s are nearly impossible to eliminate. The investigations showed that depending on the installed technologies the treatment costs for such a hospital treatment facility may be up to 5.50 € per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pills-project.eu/PILLS_summary_english.pdf|title=EU project PILLS summary |publisher= |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies and comparisons expect the treatment costs to increase up to 10%, mainly due to energy demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/378/publikationen/organische_mikroverunreinigungen_in_gewassern_vierte_reinigungsstufe.pdf |title=Report of the German Federal Environment Agency |publisher= |accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore important to define best available technique before extensive infrastructure investments are introduced on a wide basis.

The fate of incoming pharmaceutical residues in the STP is unpredictable. Some substances seem to be more or less completely eliminated, while others pass the different steps in the STP unaffected. There is no systematic knowledge at hand to predict how and why this happens.

Pharmaceutical residues that have been conjugated (bound to a bile acid) before being excreted from the patients may undergo de-conjugation in the STP, yielding higher levels of free pharmaceutical substance in the outlet from the STP than in its incoming water. Some pharmaceuticals with large sales volumes have not been detected in the incoming water to the STP, indicating that complete metabolism and degradation must have occurred already in the patient or during the transport of sewage from the household to the STP.

=== Regulation ===
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2018}}
In the United States, “There are no federal regulations limiting the levels of pharmaceuticals in wastewater or drinking water”, according to EPA.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Three birth controls substances and one antibiotic were added to the pharmaceuticals contaminant candidate list (CCL 3). EPA states that they are 8 pharmaceuticals that are classified as hazardous waste.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Out of 3000 pharmaceuticals EPA has only evaluated 100 of them leaving numerous of unscreened compounds in the water.” In 2008, EPA proposed an amendment to the Universal Waste Rule to address pharmaceutical wastes.” However, no action on the Rule has occurred since the hearing in the U.S. senate in 2009”.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA), [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (SDWA), and the Universal Waste Regulations under the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA) do little to protect the American population from pharmaceutical contamination in waterways.{{POV check inline|date=November 2018}} The EPA has the ability to implement governmental regulations to insure that the public has access to water that is free of pharmaceutical pollution however, no laws have been enacted even though “ the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports that some research has demonstrated potential impact on human health from exposure to pharmaceuticals found in drinking water, such as antibiotics and EE2 substances that interfere with human hormone development”.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The EPA and other governmental agencies are not focused on this issue. They are not demanding any changes or regulations for Pharmaceutical pollution. They did not review the 3000 Pharmaceutical substances to determine their effect on human health.  There are no long term studies or health assessments created to examine how this affects us or the environment.

== Treatment methods ==
PPCPs are emerging pollutants, which pose potential risks on the environment and health. They are the result of many sectors, such as household consumption, industrial, farming, medicine, and aquaculture. However, because of the toxic and intractable characteristics, these pollutants cannot be removed by a traditional wastewater treatment plant in an effective way. Hence, they are becoming more and more universal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The fact that conventional wastewater treatment processes could not eradicate PPCPs completely has been highlighted. In final effluents, high concentrations of PPCPs can be detected, and these contaminants can accumulate in rivers, sludge, soil, and biosolids.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolpin|first=Dana W.|last2=Furlong|first2=Edward T.|last3=Meyer|first3=Michael T.|last4=Thurman|first4=E.

As such, environmental pollution caused by PPCPs are becoming more and more serious. Therefore, the removal of PPCPs is an urgent topic in the treatment of wastewater. Up to now, the methods used for the removal of PPCPs can be roughly divided into three categories, including physical, chemical, and biological methods.

=== Physical adsorption processes ===
The most common physical process is adsorption. It is usually used to remove traceable organic pollutants in water. Generally, carbon-based materials, which include [[biochar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/biochar-takes-the-pharmaceuticals-out-of-urine/2500487.article|title=Biochar takes the pharmaceuticals out of urine|work=Chemistry World|access-date=2018-11-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  activated carbon, graphene and graphene oxide, and carbon nanotubes, are applied to absorb PPCPs from aqueous solution. Different materials have a different adsorption capacity for PPCPs. As for these materials, carbon nanotubes have the highest adsorption capacity, while the adsorption capacity adjusted with the surface chemistry and properties of carbon nanotubes. By comparison, activated carbon as a traditional adsorbent has a wide application in adsorption of PPCPs from wastewater. Although physical adsorption processes are regarded as an advanced technology, and developing fast in the field of treatment methods, there are still some problems that should be addressed in future research, like the production of carbon nanotubes, the high cost of graphene, and the absorption of macromolecular substances. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Biological degradation processes ===
Microbial degradation is regarded as an essential method for the removal of organic pollutants. The processes have numerous advantages, like economical input costs, and mild operational conditions. In these processes, microorganisms can make use of their metabolic functions to degrade the contaminants and in some cases several microbes cooperate with each other to achieve this goal. Pure cultures, mixed cultures, and activated sludge processes can be used in these processes, while an activated sludge process is widely used as a biological treatment in the conventional wastewater treatment plants. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Constructed wetlands show great promise and are discussed below.

=== Chemical advanced oxidation processes ===
Advanced chemical [[Redox|oxidation]] processes are effective in removing PPCPs from wastewater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These include [[Ozone|ozonation]], [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton oxidation]], [[ionizing radiation]], and [[Ultraviolet|UV treatment]], are efficient in the degradation of recalcitrant organic pollutants in aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WANG|first=JIAN LONG|last2=XU|first2=LE JIN|date=2012-02|title=Advanced Oxidation Processes for Wastewater Treatment: Formation of Hydroxyl Radical and Application|journal=Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=251–325|doi=10.1080/10643389.2010.507698|issn=1064-3389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these, ozonation is the most widely used oxidation method for the removal of PPCPs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Combined chemical and biological methods ===
Because some PPCPs are highly resistant and toxic to microorganisms, it can be difficult for biological methods to eliminate them on their own. On the other hand, advanced chemical oxidation processes behave well in removing persistent pollutants, but the intermediates produced during the treatment process are sometimes more resistant to oxidation. Thus, if using one of these two methods to treat pollutants, the process requires long times and high energy inputs, resulting in a high cost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to overcome the shortfalls of using a single method, combinations of biological and chemical processes have increasingly been applied in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-12-01|title=Removal of diclofenac from surface water by electron beam irradiation combined with a biological aerated filter|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0969806X14001947|journal=Radiation Physics and Chemistry|language=en|volume=105|pages=104–108|doi=10.1016/j.radphyschem.2014.05.019|issn=0969-806X|last1=He|first1=Shijun|last2=Wang|first2=Jianlong|last3=Ye|first3=Longfei|last4=Zhang|first4=Youxue|last5=Yu|first5=Jiang}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first stage, advanced chemical oxidation processes are used for pre-treatment to transform persistent pollutants into the biodegradable intermediates. Then, biological methods are applied to degrade them. Combined systems are being shown to be efficient and cost effective. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Examples==
===Blister packs===
80% of pills in the world are packed with [[Blister pack|blister packaging,]] which is the most convenient type for several reasons.&lt;ref name=":0al"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Pharmaceutical Blister Packaging, Part I: Rationale and Materials|last = Pilchik|first = Ron|date = November 2000|journal = Pharmaceutical Technology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |pages = 68–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blister packs have two main components, the “lid” and the “blister” (cavity). Lid is mainly manufactured with [[Aluminium|aluminum]] (Al) and [[paper]]. The Cavity consists of [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[polypropylene]] (PP), [[polyester]] (PET) or aluminum (Al).&lt;ref name=":0al" /&gt; If users employ proper disposal methods, all these materials can be [[Recycling|recycled]] and the harmful effects to the [[Natural environment|environment]] can be minimized. However, a problem arises with the improper disposal either by burning or disposing as normal household waste.

Burning of blister packs directly causes [[air pollution]] by the [[combustion]] products of polypropylene ([C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), polyester ([C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;), and polyvinyl chloride ([CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCl]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;). The combustion reactions and products of these chemicals are mentioned below.

===Nail polish remover===
[[Nail polish remover]] has the ability to enter bodies of water and soil after entering landfills or by precipitation, such as rain or snow. However, due to [[acetone]]'s high volatility, most of it that enters the bodies of water and soil will evaporate again and re-enter the atmosphere. Not all of the acetone molecules will evaporate again, and so, when acetone remains in the bodies of water or soil, a reaction will occur. Nail polish remover evaporates easily because acetone's intermolecular forces are weak. An acetone molecule can't attract other acetone molecules easily because its hydrogens are not slightly positive. The only force that holds acetone molecules together is its permanent dipoles which are weaker than hydrogen bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://employees.csbsju.edu/hjakubowski/classes/Chem%20and%20Society/IMF_Solutions/olIMF_solutions.htm|title=Intermolecular Forces and Solutions|website=employees.csbsju.edu|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nail polish remover.jpg|thumb|310x310px|
Nail polish remover contains acetone. 
]]
Since nail polish remover is a solvent, it will dissolve in water. When acetone dissolves in water, it hydrogen bonds with water. The more nail polish remover that enters the hydrosphere will increase the concentration of acetone and then increase the concentration of the solution created when acetone and water bonds. If enough nail polish remover is disposed, it can reach the lethal dose level for aquatic life.

Nail polish remover can also enter the lithosphere by landfills and by precipitation. However, it will not bind to the soil. Microorganisms in the soil will decompose acetone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp21.pdf|title=Toxilogical Profile for Acetone|last=|first=|date=May 1994|website=www.atsdr.cdc.gov|publisher=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of microorganisms decomposing acetone is the risk it has to cause oxygen depletion in bodies of water. The more acetone readily available for microorganism decomposition leads to more microorganisms reproduced and thus oxygen depletion because more microorganisms use up the available oxygen.

When nail polish remover evaporates, acetone enters the atmosphere in the gaseous phase. In the gaseous phase, acetone can undergo photolysis and breakdown into carbon monoxide, methane, and ethane.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2415445|title=The Mechanism of the Gas Phase Photolysis of Acetone|first1=R.

(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)2CO + hv → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+ CO

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;+ (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)2CO → CH4 + CH2COCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

2CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → C2H6

A second pathway that nail polish remover can enter in the atmosphere is reacting with hydroxyl radicals. When acetone reacts with hydroxyl radicals, its main product is methylglyoxal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp21-c5.pdf|title=Toxicological Profile for Acetone - Potential for Human Exposure|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Methylglyoxal]] is an organic compound that is a by-product of many metabolic pathways. It is an intermediate precursor for many [[advanced glycation end-product]]s, that are formed for diseases such as diabetes or neurodegenerative diseases. The following reaction occurs:

(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)2CO + ·OH → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C(O)OH + ·CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

=== Case study ===
[[File:Pearl River Delta Area.png|thumb|466x466px|The Location of the Pearl River Delta]]

==== Pearl River, South China ====
It is well known that releasing antibiotics into the water can lead to antibiotic resistance. In the recent decade, the Pearl River has been altered by antibiotics. A study found that concentrations of antibiotics were lower than those in the estuary, and decreased from the east side to the west side. A series of phenomena showed that the primary sources of antibiotics came from river tributaries and terrigenous sources and there were frequent human activities and hydraulic conditions along the west banks of the river. Seasonal variations happened in most of the detected antibiotics in water as well. Additionally, the TOC content of sediments, and the pH of water affected the performance of antibiotics. The highest concentrations of antibiotics were found downstream of Guangdong Province, which was affected severely by nearby densely populated megacities, like Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and Macau. These have an adverse impact on people there. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-09-01|title=The distribution and partitioning of common antibiotics in water and sediment of the Pearl River Estuary, South China|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653513004748|journal=Chemosphere|language=en|volume=92|issue=11|pages=1410–1416|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.03.044|pmid=23628172|issn=0045-6535|last1=Liang|first1=Ximei|last2=Chen|first2=Baowei|last3=Nie|first3=Xiangping|last4=Shi|first4=Zhen|last5=Huang|first5=Xiaoping|last6=Li|first6=Xiangdong|hdl=10397/23573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The coast of Guangdong, South China ====
The coast of Guangdong is a place polluted by another representative contaminant, plastic debris. After an extended period of observation, scientists found that the beach was a place that would help the fragmentation of plastic debrisinto highly fragmented plastic particles that can attach to small organisms. Through the process of washback, the plastic debris may be transported into the water, and make an adverse impact on a wide range of marine life at different trophic levels. It is noticeable that polystyrene (PS) foams and fragments, and microplastics account for a great percentage of plastic debris on the beach. Most of the polystyrenes degrade within a year on average, and could not be observed in deep beach sediment. Thus, coastal beaches store highly fragmented and degraded micro-plastics. However, they may be active and return to the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-01-01|title=Size distribution of stranded small plastic debris on the coast of Guangdong, South China|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749116314828|journal=Environmental Pollution|language=en|volume=220|issue=Pt A|pages=407–412|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.079|pmid=27717531|issn=0269-7491|last1=Fok|first1=Lincoln|last2=Cheung|first2=Pui Kwan|last3=Tang|first3=Guangda|last4=Li|first4=Wai Chin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== An alternative best management practice for PPCPs treatment – the application of constructed wetlands ==
[[File:Structures of constructed wetlands.jpg|thumb|368x368px|Structures of constructed wetlands: (a) surface flow (SF-CW); (b) horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF-CW); and (c) vertical subsurface flow (VSSF-CW). ]]
In recent years, scientists have been trying to find a way to handle PPCPs, but most of the advanced treatment processes are too expensive to apply in large scale. As such, a low-cost alternative approach for PPCPs treatment is of great significance for the environment. Based on this purpose, increasing concerns have been raised on constructed wetlands, which are cheaper in construction, operation, maintenance and monitoring. Actually, constructed wetlands have been proved to be effective for removal of conventional contaminants in wastewater treatment. However, applying constructed wetlands to deal with these issues is a totally new application in the field. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781420012514|title=Treatment Wetlands, Second Edition|last=Kadlec|first=Robert|last2=Wallace|first2=Scott|date=2008-07-22|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781566705264|language=en|doi=10.1201/9781420012514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GARCÍA|first=JOAN|last2=ROUSSEAU|first2=DIEDERIK P.

=== Important components of constructed wetlands ===

==== Substrate ====
Based on several researches and further analysis for various constructed wetlands, scientists found that gravel is the most common substrate materials for the removal of PPCPs in constructed wetlands. The gravel substrate is efficient for some certain PPCPs which are difficult to be biodegraded but with relatively high hydrophobicity.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; On the other hand, according to a set of experiments &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-07-15|title=Selection of a support matrix for the removal of some phenoxyacetic compounds in constructed wetlands systems|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969707002148|journal=Science of the Total Environment|language=en|volume=380|issue=1–3|pages=237–246|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2007.02.015|pmid=17379272|issn=0048-9697|last1=Dordio|first1=Ana V.|last2=Teimão|first2=José|last3=Ramalho|first3=Idália|last4=Carvalho|first4=A.

==== Vegetation ====
Vegetation plays an important part in directly taking up several organic pollutants from wastewater in constructed wetlands. With the function of diffusion, the organic pollutants like PPCPs can be transported within plants. That means, theses pollutants cannot move into the plant tissues through the plant roots and some specific transporters. Generally, the physico-chemical characteristics of PPCPs, such as hydrophobicity, water solubility, and concentration, affect the diffusion of the compounds.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-05-15|title=Organic xenobiotics removal in constructed wetlands, with emphasis on the importance of the support matrix|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389413001842|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|language=en|volume=252-253|pages=272–292|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2013.03.008|pmid=23542322|issn=0304-3894|last1=Dordio|first1=A.V.|last2=Carvalho|first2=A.J.P.|hdl=10174/9895}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-12-01|title=Effects of plants and microorganisms in wwconstructed wetlands for wastewater treatment|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975003001319|journal=Biotechnology Advances|language=en|volume=22|issue=1–2|pages=93–117|doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2003.08.010|pmid=14623046|issn=0734-9750|last1=Stottmeister|first1=U.|last2=Wießner|first2=A.|last3=Kuschk|first3=P.|last4=Kappelmeyer|first4=U.|last5=Kästner|first5=M.|last6=Bederski|first6=O.|last7=Müller|first7=R.A.|last8=Moormann|first8=H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being soaked up by plants, the degradation may happen in metabolism processes.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-08-01|title=Assessment of plant-driven removal of emerging organic pollutants by duckweed|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653510006363|journal=Chemosphere|language=en|volume=80|issue=7|pages=687–692|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.05.045|pmid=20580410|issn=0045-6535|last1=Reinhold|first1=Dawn|last2=Vishwanathan|first2=Saritha|last3=Park|first3=Jung Jae|last4=Oh|first4=David|last5=Michael Saunders|first5=F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the activities of microbial populations, there are numerous biological processes occurring in the rhizosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-06-01|title=Comprehensive assessment of the design configuration of constructed wetlands for the removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products from urban wastewaters|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135410002757|journal=Water Research|language=en|volume=44|issue=12|pages=3669–3678|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2010.04.022|pmid=20494393|issn=0043-1354|last1=Hijosa-Valsero|first1=María|last2=Matamoros|first2=Víctor|last3=Sidrach-Cardona|first3=Ricardo|last4=Martín-Villacorta|first4=Javier|last5=Bécares|first5=Eloy|last6=Bayona|first6=Josep M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-03-01|title=Assessment of full-scale natural systems for the removal of PPCPs from wastewater in small communities|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135409007052|journal=Water Research|language=en|volume=44|issue=5|pages=1429–1439|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2009.10.032|pmid=19913872|issn=0043-1354|last1=Hijosa-Valsero|first1=María|last2=Matamoros|first2=Víctor|last3=Martín-Villacorta|first3=Javier|last4=Bécares|first4=Eloy|last5=Bayona|first5=Josep M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-12-01|title=Removal of nutrients and veterinary antibiotics from swine wastewater by a constructed macrophyte floating bed system|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030147971000232X|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|language=en|volume=91|issue=12|pages=2657–2661|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.07.036|pmid=20696518|issn=0301-4797|last1=Xian|first1=Qiming|last2=Hu|first2=Lixia|last3=Chen|first3=Hancheng|last4=Chang|first4=Zhizhou|last5=Zou|first5=Huixian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; However, the toxicity of PPCPs to plants is a nonnegligible issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dordio|first=Ana|last2=Ferro|first2=Raquel|last3=Teixeira|first3=Dora|last4=Palace|first4=Alfredo J.|last5=Pinto|first5=Ana P.|last6=Dias|first6=Cristina M.B.|date=2011-06-15|title=Study on the use ofTyphaspp. for the phytotreatment of water contaminated with ibuprofen|journal=International Journal of Environmental Analytical Chemistry|language=en|volume=91|issue=7–8|pages=654–667|doi=10.1080/03067311003782708|issn=0306-7319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013-05-01|title=Elimination of veterinary antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes from swine wastewater in the vertical flow constructed wetlands|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653513000544|journal=Chemosphere|language=en|volume=91|issue=8|pages=1088–1093|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.007|pmid=23380031|issn=0045-6535|last1=Liu|first1=Lin|last2=Liu|first2=Chaoxiang|last3=Zheng|first3=Jiayu|last4=Huang|first4=Xu|last5=Wang|first5=Zhen|last6=Liu|first6=Yuhong|last7=Zhu|first7=Gefu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Microbes ====
The processes of transformation and mineralization of nutrients and organic pollutants are primarily dependent on microbes in constructed wetlands, and the microbial degradation processes can occur in both the aerobic and the anaerobic environments with the participation of diverse microorganisms, like fungi, specific protozoa, heterotrophic bacteria, and autotrophic bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781420012514|title=Treatment Wetlands, Second Edition|last=Kadlec|first=Robert|last2=Wallace|first2=Scott|date=2008-07-22|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781566705264|language=en|doi=10.1201/9781420012514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Guibing|last2=Jetten|first2=Mike S.

However, for PPCPs, which are xenobiotic organic pollutants with totally different compounds, they are degraded relatively slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780203491454|title=Biogeochemistry of Wetlands|last=Ramesh Reddy|first=K|last2=DeLaune|first2=Ronald|date=2008-07-28|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781566706780|language=en|doi=10.1201/9780203491454}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Even though there are non-specific enzymes, the rate of degradation is still slower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seffernick|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Wackett|first2=Lawrence P.|date=2001-10|title=Rapid Evolution of Bacterial Catabolic Enzymes:  A Case Study with Atrazine Chlorohydrolase†|journal=Biochemistry|language=en|volume=40|issue=43|pages=12747–12753|doi=10.1021/bi011293r|issn=0006-2960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pending questions ==

* Is there a temperature at which PPCPs are burned and destroyed? Would they thus be eliminated when materials are made into [[biochar]]?
* Are there [[Food coloring|artificial colorings]] that degrade under similar conditions to PPCPs and could be used as [[Proxy (statistics)|proxies]] in [[Low technology|low-tech]] experiments of how to eliminate PPCPs?
* [[Ultraviolet|Ultraviolet light]] is known to degrade PPCPs. How long would urine need to lay in the sun in transparent bottles to destroy the PPCPs before its use as fertilizer? 
* Do [[Microorganism|soil microbes]] develop or [[Evolution|evolve]] the ability to break down PPCPs over time? If a person who consumes a pharmaceutical uses a [[Urine-diverting dry toilet|Urine-diverting Dry Toilet]], in which the urine is dispersed into fertile soil among plants, would the microbes eventually decompose this chemical entirely? After how much time? Which types of pharmaceuticals would break down faster and which slower?
* Are there types of PPCPs that cannot enter into the roots of plants because their molecules are simply too large?
* When [[Essential oil|essential oils]] are extracted from plants, would PPCPs pass into them, stay in the cauldron, or be destroyed by the heat?

      <comment>c/e. Power plants &amp; factories with once-through cooling systems don't use cooling towers or intake towers; see the diagram. Fish screens are used in all kinds of intake systems.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8203">[[File:Fish screen-Redlands Canal.jpg|thumb|right|Fish screen at Redlands Canal, near [[Grand Junction, Colorado]]]]
A '''fish screen''' is designed to prevent [[fish]] from swimming or being drawn into an [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]], [[Water cooling#Industrial usage|cooling water intake]], [[intake tower]], [[dam]] or other diversion on a [[river]], [[lake]] or waterway where water is taken for human use. They are intended to supply debris-free water without harming aquatic life. Fish screens are typically installed to protect [[endangered species]] of fishes that would otherwise be harmed or killed when passing through industrial facilities such as [[steam electric power plant]]s, [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] [[electrical generator|generator]]s, [[oil refinery|petroleum refineries]], [[chemical plant]]s, farm [[irrigation]] water and municipal [[water purification|drinking water treatment]] plants. However, many fish are killed or injured on screens or elsewhere in the intake structures.

==Design==
Fish screens may be '''positive barriers''' (devices such as a perforated metal plate that physically prevents fish from passing) or '''behavioral barriers''' (devices that encourage fish to swim away). Most behavioral barriers are experimental and of unproven effectiveness.&lt;ref name="EPA-TDD"&gt;{{cite report |date=2004 |title=Technical Development Document for the Final Section 316(b) Phase II Existing Facilities Rule |chapter=Chapter 4. Efficacy of Cooling Water Intake Structure Technologies |url=https://www.epa.gov/cooling-water-intakes/support-documents-phase-ii-cooling-water-intake-rule-2004-withdrawn |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA 821-R-04-007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 4–19}}

[[File:Cooling water intake &amp; travelling screens.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram of typical vertical traveling screens used with industrial cooling water intake structures]]
Positive barriers are often effective at keeping aquatic organisms from entering a cooling system, but may also kill them by impinging them on the screens.&lt;ref name="Schmitz"&gt;{{cite news |title=One Fish, Two Fish, 46 Million Lake Erie Dead Fish |author=Schmitz, Christy |url= |newspaper=Toledo City Paper |publisher=Adams Street Publishing Co. |location=Toledo, OH |date=2009-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These barrier types are widely used and include:
* Modified traveling screens
* Fish handling and return systems
* Horizontal, flat-plate screens with bypass water return systems
* Cylindrical wedgewire screens
* Fine-mesh screens
* Fish net barriers.
Besides simply preventing fish from passing, fish screens are designed to minimize stress and injury that occur when fish impact the screen or are subjected to changes in water velocity and direction caused by the diversion.&lt;ref name="EPA-TDD" /&gt;{{rp|pp.4-3ff}}

The U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has evaluated other barrier technologies and identified some as potentially effective, although not widely demonstrated (as of 2004):
* Aquatic microfiltration barriers
* Angled and modular inclined screens
* Velocity caps.&lt;ref name="EPA-TDD" /&gt;{{rp|pp.4–15ff}}

Some fish screens are designed to protect a single species of fish (for example, [[salmon]]) and are not necessarily effective at protecting other fish species. Some screens are capable of protecting more than one species or type of life. Additionally, some screens may effectively protect juvenile and adult fish, but not fish eggs and [[larva]]e.&lt;ref name="EPA 2002"&gt;EPA (2002). "National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System—Proposed Regulations to Establish Requirements for Cooling Water Intake Structures at Phase II Existing Facilities; Proposed Rule." {{USFR|67|17136}}. 2002-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of a fish screen varies from thousands of US dollars for small, low-flow-rate screens to millions of US dollars in the case of very large custom-designed systems that filter a large flow of water. Maintenance costs can be significant, including repairs, removing trash, and adjusting the equipment for changes in stream conditions.

For some low volume, non-industrial water diversion applications, there are screens available that have no moving parts, do not require electricity, and have very little need for maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction to the Farmers Screen |url=http://farmerscreen.org/farmers-screen/about/intro/|publisher=Farmers Conservation Alliance |location=Hood River, OR |accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impacts on aquatic life==
[[File:Indian Point.jpg|thumb|The [[Indian Point Energy Center]] in New York. Over a billion fish eggs and larvae are killed in its cooling system each year.]]
Many power plants and other industries in the U.S. continue to use screens that impinge fish.

==Legal requirements==
In the [[United States]], the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]], a division of [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]], mandates positive-barrier fishscreens in most new diversions from waterways where endangered or threatened fish species occur. Some existing unscreened diversions whose construction pre-dates fish-screen mandates are allowed to continue operating by [[grandfather clause|grandfather rule]].

The '''Forest History Society''' is an [[United States|American]] non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of forest and conservation history.&lt;ref name=FHS&gt;"Forest History Society." Echo Project. Center for History and New Media, George Mason University. http://echo.gmu.edu/node/144&lt;/ref&gt; The society was established in 1946 and incorporated in 1955.&lt;ref name=FHS/&gt;

The Forest History Society headquarters in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], [[North Carolina]], include the Alvin J. Huss Archives and the [[Carl A. Weyerhaeuser]] Library, which combine to provide a comprehensive compilation of materials related to the topic of forest history. The archives house large collections from several national organizations and companies such as the [[Society of American Foresters]], the [[American Forest and Paper Association]], the [[American Forests|American Forestry Association]], the [[Tree farm#American Tree Farm System|American Tree Farm System]], and the [[Weyerhaeuser|Weyerhaeuser Company]] as well as many other smaller collections of national and international significance.&lt;ref&gt;"Changing Roles of the Forest History Society: New Approaches to Environmental History in North America." ''Methods and Approaches in Forest History''. Agnoletti, Mauro, et al., eds. Wallingford, England: CABI Publishing, 2000, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the Forest History Society maintains a publication program, publishing the ''Environmental History'' journal, ''Forest History Today'' magazine, an Issues Series, and environmental and conservation-focused monographs; an education program, to build understanding and appreciation of human interaction with the natural world; and a liaison function between scholars, policymakers, and landowners. The Society also works to promote and reward academic scholarship in the fields of forest, conservation, and environmental history.

==History==
In 1946, a small group of historians and forest industry executives came together to form an organization dedicated to preserving the documentary forest heritage of North America. The "Forest Products History Foundation" was founded, and began as a program of the [[Minnesota Historical Society]].

Over the following decade, archival source materials were collected, an oral history interview program was created, and a scholarly quarterly journal began publication. In 1955, under second executive director Elwood Rondeau "Woody" Maunder, the Society incorporated as an independent nonprofit organization under the new name "Forest History Foundation." The name was changed to "Forest History Society" four years later in 1959.

The organization left Minnesota in 1964, moving first to the [[Yale University]] campus in 1964, and then to the [[University of California at Santa Cruz]] in 1969. In 1984 the Society was moved to its current home in Durham, North Carolina, establishing an affiliation with [[Duke University]] and the [[Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences|Nicholas School of the Environment]].

In 1996, a partnership was formed between the Forest History Society and the [[American Society for Environmental History]]. This relationship helped widen the scope of the Society's mission beyond the boundaries of forest and conservation history to include subjects related to the broader field of environmental history.

==Publications==
The Forest History Society publishes a magazine, ''Forest History Today'', and co-publishes the ''Environmental History'' journal with the [[American Society for Environmental History]]. A regular Issues Series is also published by the Society on environmental topics of contemporary interest such as fire, wetlands, and forests. Featured books representing important scholarship in the fields of forest, conservation, and environmental history are also published. The Society provides further financial, editorial, and research assistance to other authors publishing books in the subject area of environmental history.

'''Genre fiction''', also known as '''popular fiction''', is a term used in the book-trade for [[fiction|fictional works]] written with the intent of fitting into a specifically [[literary genre]], in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=French|first=Christy Tillery|title=Literary Fiction vs Genre Fiction|url=http://www.authorsden.com/visit/viewArticle.asp?id=18884|work=AuthorsDen|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Genre fiction is generally distinguished from [[literary fiction]], a number of major literary figures have also written genre fiction, for example, [[John Banville]], publishes crime novels as Benjamin Black, and both [[Doris Lessing]], and [[Margaret Atwood]] have written science fiction. [[Georges Simenon]], the creator of the [[Maigret]] [[detective novel]]s, has been described by [[André Gide]] as "the most novelistic of novelists in French literature".&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Claffey, ''The Boston Globe September'',  10, 1989 Contributing to this report was Boston Globe book editor Mark Feeney. http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-09-10/features/8903020475_1_inspector-maigret-georges-simenon-detective-story&lt;/ref&gt;

The main genres are crime, fantasy, romance, science fiction, western, inspirational, historical fiction and horror. More commercially oriented genre fiction has been dismissed by literary critics as poorly written or escapist.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

==Genre and the marketing of fiction==

In the publishing industry the term "category fiction" is often used as a synonym for genre fiction, with the categories serving as the familiar shelf headings within the fiction section of a bookstore, such as [[Western fiction|Western]] or mystery.

The uncategorized section is known in the industry as "general fiction", but in fact many of the titles in this usually large section are often themselves genre novels that have been placed in the general section because sellers believe they will appeal, due to their high quality or other special characteristics, to a wider audience than merely the readers of that genre.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Adult fans are often embarrassed to read genre fiction in public,&lt;ref name=wollheim200606&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.locusmag.com/2006/Issues/06Wollheim.html|title=Locus Online: Betsy Wollheim interview excerpts|magazine=Locus |date=June 2006 | access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; but authors known for literary fiction have written novels under pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Merritt|first=Stephanie|title=Forget 'serious' novels, I've turned to a life of crime|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/14/crime-fiction-merritt-sj-parris|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 April 2013|location=London|date=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=STASIO|first=MARILYN|title=Next Victim|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/books/review/Stasio-t.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=KAKUTANI|first=MICHIKO|title=Critic's Notebook; Kill!

Though a production not promoted by secondary criticism it is popular literature that holds the largest market share.{{clarify|date=September 2018}} Romance fiction had an estimated $1.375 billion share in the US book market in 2007. Religion/inspirational literature followed with $819 million, science fiction/fantasy with $700 million, mystery with $650 million and then classic literary fiction with $466 million.&lt;ref&gt;See the page [http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics Romance Literature Statistics: Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223085813/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/the_romance_genre/romance_literature_statistics |date=2007-12-23 }} (visited March 16, 2009) of ''[http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home Romance Writers of America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203140439/http://www.rwanational.org/cs/home |date=2010-12-03 }}'' homepage.

==History of genres==
{{See also|History of fantasy|History of science fiction}}
[[Genre]] began as an absolute classification system for [[ancient Greek literature]]. [[Poetry]], [[prose]], and [[drama]] each had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story.  Among the genres were the [[epic (genre)|epic]] in poetry and [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]] for plays.&lt;ref&gt;Hadas, Moses (1950). ''A History of Greek Literature''. New York, NY: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In later periods other genres such as the [[chivalric romance]], [[opera]], and [[prose fiction]] developed.

Though the [[novel]] is often seen as a modern genre, [[Ian Watt]], in ''The Rise of the Novel'' (1957) suggests that the novel first came into being in the early 18th century,&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite web|title=Literary critic Ian Watt dies after a long illness|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/99/991217watt.html|website=Stanford News Service|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has also been described as possessing "a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years", from the time of both [[Classical Greece]] and [[Classical Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref name="The True Story of the Novel"&gt;Margaret Anne Doody, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BBYU6jyA3MUC&amp;pg=PA1 ''The True Story of the Novel'']. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1996, rept. 1997, p. 1. Retrieved 25 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "romance" is a closely related long prose narrative. [[Walter Scott]] defined it as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents", whereas in the novel "the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society".&lt;ref&gt;"Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p.129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992, p.xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many romances, including the [[Historical novel|historical romance]]s of Scott,&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning, pp.xxv-xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''&lt;ref name="Moers, Ellen 1978"&gt;Moers, Ellen. ''Literary Women: The Great Writers''[1976] (London: The Women’s Press, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick] Robert McCrum, "The Hundred best novels: Moby Dick", ''The Observer'', Sunday 12 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; are also frequently called novels, and Scott describes romance as a "kindred term". Romance, as defined here, should not be confused with the genre fiction love romance or [[romance novel]]. Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: "a novel is ''le roman'', ''der Roman'', ''il romanzo''."&lt;ref name="Doody 1996, p. 15"&gt;Doody (1996), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre fiction developed from various subgenres of the novel (and its "romance" version) during the nineteenth century, along with the growth of the [[mass-marketing]] of fiction in the twentieth century: this includes the [[gothic novel]], [[fantasy]], [[science fiction]], [[adventure novel]], [[historical romance]], and the [[detective novel]]. Some scholars see precursors to the genre fiction [[romance novel]]s in [[literary fiction]] of the 18th and 19th centuries, including [[Samuel Richardson]]'s [[sentimental novel]] ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740) and the novels of [[Jane Austen]] such as ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813).&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Regis, ''A Natural History of the Romance Novel'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The genres==
{{mainlist|List of literary genres}}
The following are some of the main genres as they are used in contemporary publishing:

===Crime===
{{Main article|Crime fiction|Detective fiction}}
Crime fiction is the [[literary genre]] that fictionalises [[crime]]s, their detection, criminals, and their [[Motive (law)|motives]]. It is usually distinguished from [[Literary fiction|mainstream]] fiction and other genres such as [[historical fiction]] or [[science fiction]], but the boundaries are indistinct. Crime fiction has multiple [[subgenres]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=990082541924074;res=IELAPA|title = May I Suggest Murder?: An Overview of Crime Fiction for Readers' Advisory Services Staff|last = Franks|first = Rachel|date = 2011|journal = Australian Library Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 18 January 2016|volume = 60|issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[detective fiction]] (such as the [[whodunit]]), [[courtroom drama]], [[hardboiled|hard-boiled]] fiction, [[mystery fiction]], and [[legal thriller]]s. [[Suspense]] and mystery are key elements to the genre.

===Fantasy===
{{Main article|Fantasy|History of fantasy|Fantasy literature}}
[[Fantasy]] is a [[genre]] of [[fiction]] that uses [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or other [[supernatural]] elements as a main [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] element, [[Theme (literature)|theme]], or [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]. Many works within the genre take place in [[imaginary world]]s where magic and [[Legendary creature|magical creatures]] are common. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of [[science fiction]] and [[horror fiction|horror]] by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap among the three, all of which are subgenres of [[speculative fiction]]. In [[popular culture]], the fantasy genre predominantly features a [[Medievalism|medieval]]-type setting.

===Romance===
{{Main article|Romance novel}}
The [[romance novel]] or "romantic novel" primarily focuses on the relationship and [[Romance (love)|romantic love]] between two&amp;nbsp;people, and must have an "emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending."&lt;ref name="rwadefn"&gt;{{cite web   | title = The Romance Genre Overview | publisher = [[Romance Writers of America]]  | url =http://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=578  | accessdate = November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many subgenres of the romance novel including [[fantasy]], [[Historical romance|historical]], [[science fiction]], same sex romantic fiction, and [[paranormal fiction]].

There is a [[literary fiction]] form of romance, which [[Walter Scott]] defined as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Scott, "Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p. 129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', Susan Maning, ed Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Romance Writers of America''{{'s}} data,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=582 Romance Writers of America]&lt;/ref&gt; the most important subgenres are: [[Category romance|Contemporary series romance]], [[Contemporary romance]], [[Historical romance]], [[Paranormal romance]], [[Romantic suspense]], [[Inspirational fiction|Inspirational romance]], Romantic suspense (series).
*Other: [[chick-lit]], [[erotic romance novels|erotic romance]], [[women's fiction]], [[Young Adult Romance Literature|Young adult romance]].

===Science fiction===
{{Main article|Science fiction}}
Science fiction is a [[genre]] of [[speculative fiction]] dealing with [[imagination|imaginative]] concepts such as [[future|futuristic]] [[science]] and [[technology]], [[spaceflight|space travel]], [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]], [[faster than light travel]], [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] and [[extraterrestrial life]]. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other [[innovation]]s, and has been called a "literature of ideas".&lt;ref name="Science Fiction: The Literature of Ideas"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Marg Gilks |author2=Paula Fleming |author3=Moira Allen | title = Science Fiction: The Literature of Ideas | work = | publisher =WritingWorld.com | year =2003 | url = http://www.writing-world.com/sf/sf.shtml | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually eschews the [[supernatural]], and unlike the related genre of [[fantasy]], historically science fiction stories were intended to have at least pretense of [[science|science-based fact or theory]] at the time the story was created, but this connection has become tenuous or non-existent in much of science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loa.org/sciencefiction/introduction.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506221319/http://www.loa.org/sciencefiction/introduction.jsp |archivedate=May 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/jenkins_mi.html |title=Media and Imagination: A Short History of American Science Fiction |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Misa |url=http://misabuckley.com/does-the-science-in-science-fiction-matter/ |title=Does the Science in Science Fiction Matter? |publisher=Misa Buckley |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western===
{{Main article|Western fiction}}
Western fiction is defined primarily by being set in the [[Western United States|American West]] in the second half of the 19th century and, secondarily, by featuring heroes who are rugged, individualistic horsemen ([[cowboy]]s). Other genres, such as romance, have subgenres that make use of the Western setting.

===Inspirational===
{{Main article|Inspirational fiction}}
Inspirational fiction is fictional works with faith-based themes.  It may be targeted at a specific demographic, such as Christians.  Modern inspirational fiction has grown to encompass non-traditional subgenres, such as inspirational thrillers.

===Horror===
{{Main article|Horror fiction}}
[[Horror fiction]] aims to frighten or disgust its readers.  Although many horror novels feature supernatural phenomena or monsters, it is not required.  Early horror took much inspiration from [[Romanticism]] and [[Gothic fiction]].  Modern horror, such as [[cosmic horror]] and [[splatterpunk]], tends to be less melodramatic and more explicit.  Horror is often mixed with other genres.

==Critical appraisal and controversy==
Although frequently ignored or ridiculed by literary critics, genre fiction has achieved a measure of acceptance among some modern critics, with [[Stephen King]] being awarded the [[National Book Award|Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters]];&lt;ref name=natbook&gt;[http://www.nationalbook.org/amerletters.html "Distinguished Contribution to American Letters "], National Book Foundation, Retrieved March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; but this polarized opinions and led to debate on genre fiction's literary merit.  Negative comments about genre fiction have sparked responses from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'',&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Lev|title=Literary Revolution in the Supermarket Aisle: Genre Fiction Is Disruptive Technology|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/05/23/genre-fiction-is-disruptive-technology/|work=Time|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Erik|title=Stephen King: You can be popular and good|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/07/06/stephen_king_you_can_be_popular_and_good/|work=Salon|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[the Atlantic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Alan|title=A Defense of Stephen King, Master of the Decisive Moment|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/07/a-defense-of-stephen-king-master-of-the-decisive-moment/260187/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dickey |first=Colin |title=King &amp; I: Stephen King and a Balanced Diet |url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=784&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media= |work=Los Angeles Review of Books |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414150715/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?type=&amp;id=784&amp;fulltext=1&amp;media= |archivedate=14 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel laureate [[Doris Lessing]] described science fiction as "some of the best [[social fiction]] of our time", and called [[Greg Bear]], author of ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]'', "a great writer". &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.dorislessing.org/boston.html Doris Lessing: Hot Dawns]'', interview by Harvey Blume in ''Boston Book Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of major literary figures have written works of genre fiction. [[Graham Greene]] at the time of his death in 1991 had a reputation as a writer of both deeply serious novels on the theme of Catholicism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/03/biography.grahamgreene|title=More Sherry trifles|author=Ian Thomson|publisher=

Steensma|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, the [[BBC]] defended itself against charges that it had sneered at genre fiction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|title=BBC denies 'sneering' at genre fiction|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/21/bbc-genre-fiction?INTCMP=SRCH|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 April 2013|location=London|date=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Man Booker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flood|first=Alison|title=Science fiction author hits out at Booker judges|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/sep/18/science-fiction-booker-prize|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 April 2013|location=London|date=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Book Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Laura|title=National Book Awards: Genre fiction dissed again|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/10/11/national_book_awards_genre_fiction_dissed_again/|work=Salon|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been criticized for ignoring genre fiction in their selection process. 

Some critics have claimed that reading romance and suspense thrillers makes readers more sensitive, because these novels focus on interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Fong, K., Mullin, J.B., &amp; Mar, R.A. (2013). "What you read matters: The role of fiction genre in prediction interpersonal sensitivity". ''Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, And The Arts'', 7(4), 370-376.&lt;/ref&gt;

==19th-century British and Irish genre fiction==

{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}

[[Sir John Barrow]]'s descriptive [[The Eventful History of the Mutiny and Piratical Seizure of HMS Bounty|1831 account]] of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]] immortalised the Royal Navy ship {{HMS|Bounty}} and her people. The legend of [[Dick Turpin]] was popularised when the 18th-century English [[highwayman]]'s exploits appeared in the novel ''[[Rookwood (novel)|Rookwood]]'' in 1834.

Although pre-dated by [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[The King of the Golden River]]'' in 1841, the history of the modern [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] genre is generally said to begin with [[George MacDonald]], the influential author of ''[[The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and ''[[Phantastes]]'' (1858). [[William Morris]] was a popular English poet who also wrote several fantasy novels during the latter part of the nineteenth century. [[Wilkie Collins]]' [[epistolary novel]] ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868), is generally considered the first [[Detective fiction|detective novel]] in the English language, while ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' is regarded as one of the finest [[sensation novels]]. [[H. G. Wells]]'s (1866–1946) writing career began in the 1890s with science fiction novels like ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895), and ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898) which describes an invasion of late Victorian England by [[Martian]]s, and Wells is seen, along with Frenchman [[Jules Verne]] (1828–1905), as a major figure in the development of the science fiction genre. He also wrote realistic fiction about the lower middle class in novels like ''[[Kipps]]'' (1905) and ''[[The History of Mr Polly]]'' (1910).

[[Penny dreadful]] publications were an alternative to mainstream works, and were aimed at working class adolescents, introducing the infamous [[Sweeney Todd]]. The premier [[ghost story]] writer of the 19th century was the Irish writer [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]. His works include the macabre mystery novel ''[[Uncle Silas]]'' 1865, and his Gothic novella ''[[Carmilla]]'' 1872, tells the story of a young woman's susceptibility to the attentions of a female vampire. The [[vampire literature|vampire genre]] fiction began with [[John William Polidori]]'s "[[The Vampyre]]" (1819). This short story was inspired by the life of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and his poem ''[[The Giaour]]''. An important later work is ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'' (1845), where many standard vampire conventions originated: Varney has fangs, leaves two puncture wounds on the neck of his victims, and has hypnotic powers and superhuman strength. Varney was also the first example of the "sympathetic vampire", who loathes his condition but is a slave to it.&lt;ref&gt;Skal, David J. (1996). ''V is for Vampire'', p.99. New York: Plume. {{ISBN|0-452-27173-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bram Stoker]], yet another Irish writer, was the author of seminal horror work ''[[Dracula]]'' and featured as its primary antagonist the vampire [[Count Dracula]], with the [[vampire hunter]] [[Abraham Van Helsing]] his arch-enemy. ''Dracula'' has been attributed to a number of [[literary genre]]s including [[vampire literature]], [[horror fiction]], [[gothic novel]] and [[invasion literature]].

[[Image:PortraitOfACD.JPG|thumb|165px|[[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] was born in Scotland of Irish parents but his [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories have typified a fog-filled London for readers worldwide]]
[[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s [[Sherlock Holmes]] is a brilliant London-based "consulting detective", famous for his intellectual prowess, skilful use of astute observation, deductive reasoning and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Holmes' [[archenemy]] [[Professor Moriarty]], is widely considered to be the first true example of a [[supervillain]], while Sherlock Holmes has become a by-word for a detective. Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes, from 1880 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914. All but four Conan Doyle stories are narrated by Holmes' friend, assistant, and biographer, [[John Watson (Sherlock Holmes)|Dr John H. Watson]].

The [[Lost World (genre)|Lost World]] literary genre was inspired by real stories of archaeological discoveries by imperial adventurers. [[H. Rider Haggard]] wrote one of the earliest examples, ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' in 1885. Contemporary European politics and diplomatic manoeuvrings informed [[Anthony Hope]]'s swashbuckling [[Ruritanian romance|Ruritanian adventure novels]] ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' 1894, and ''[[Rupert of Hentzau]]'', 1898.

[[F. Anstey]]'s [[comic novel]] ''[[Vice Versa (book)|Vice Versa]]'' 1882, sees a father and son magically switch bodies. Satirist [[Jerome K. Jerome]]'s ''[[Three Men in a Boat]]'' 1889, is a humorous account of a boating holiday on the river [[Thames]]. Grossmith brothers [[George Grossmith|George]] &amp; [[Weedon Grossmith|Weedon]]'s ''[[Diary of a Nobody]]'' 1892, is also considered a classic work of humour.

==20th-century genre fiction==

===Early 20-century===
[[Erskine Childers (author)|Erskine Childers]]' ''[[The Riddle of the Sands]]'' (1903), defined the [[spy novel]] and Follett has also called it "the first modern [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]".&lt;ref name=follett&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ken-follett.com/suspense/index.html |title=The Art of Suspense |first=Ken |last=Follett |work=ken-follett.com |year=2016 |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emma Orczy]]'s ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' (1903) was originally a highly successful play, when staged in London in 1905. The novel ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' was published soon after the play opened and was an immediate success. Orczy gained a following of readers in Britain and throughout the world. The popularity of the novel, which recounted the adventures of a member of the English gentry in the [[French Revolution]]ary period, encouraged her to write a number of sequels for her "reckless daredevil" over the next 35 years. The play was performed to great acclaim in France, Italy, Germany and Spain, while the novel was translated into 16 languages. Subsequently, the story has been adapted for television, film, a [[The Scarlet Pimpernel (musical)|musical]] and other media. Baroness Orczy's character ''[[The Old Man in the Corner]]'' (1908) was among the earliest [[armchair detective]]s to be created. Her short stories about ''[[Lady Molly of Scotland Yard]]'' (1910) were an early example of a female detective as main character.

[[John Buchan]] wrote the [[adventure novel]]s on ''[[Prester John (novel)|Prester John]]'' (1910) and four novels telling the adventures of [[Richard Hannay]], of which the first, ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'' (1915) is the best known. Novels featuring a gentleman adventurer were popular in the [[interwar period]], exemplified by the series of [[H. C. McNeile]] with ''[[Bulldog Drummond]]'' (1920), and [[Leslie Charteris]], whose many books chronicled the adventures of [[Simon Templar]], alias ''[[Simon Templar#Publishing history|The Saint]]''.

The [[medievalist]] scholar [[M. R. James]] wrote highly regarded ghost stories (1904–1928) in contemporary settings.

This was called the [[Golden Age of Detective Fiction]]. [[Agatha Christie]], a writer of crime novels, short stories and plays, is best remembered for her 80 detective novels and her successful West End theatre plays. Christie's works, particularly those featuring the detectives [[Hercule Poirot]] or [[Miss Marple]], made her one of the most important and innovative writers in the development of the genre. Her most influential novels include ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'' (1926); one of her most controversial novels, its innovative [[twist ending]] had a significant impact on the genre), ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1934), ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937) and ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' (1939). Other female writers dubbed "Queens of crime" include [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] ([[gentleman detective]], [[Lord Peter Wimsey]]), [[Margery Allingham]] ([[Albert Campion]], supposedly created as a parody of Sayers' Wimsey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strandmag.com/campion.htm|title=The Great Detectives: Albert Campion|work=Strand Mag}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and New Zealander [[Ngaio Marsh]] ([[Roderick Alleyn]]). [[Georgette Heyer]] recreated the [[historical romance]] genre since 1921, and also wrote detective fiction (1932–1953).

A major work of science fiction, from the early 20th century, is ''[[A Voyage to Arcturus]]'' by Scottish writer [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]], first published in 1920. It combines [[fantasy]], philosophy, and science fiction in an exploration of the nature of good and evil and their relationship with existence. It has been described by critic and philosopher [[Colin Wilson]] as the "greatest novel of the twentieth century",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifidimensions.com/Nov03/arcturus.htm Book Review: A Voyage to Arcturus (1920) by David Lindsay] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215000000/http://www.scifidimensions.com/Nov03/arcturus.htm |date=December 15, 2014 }} – Review by Paul M. Kieniewicz 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and was a central influence on [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Space Trilogy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Lindskoog – [http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/index.php?command=view&amp;id=882 „A Voyage to Arcturus, C. S. Lewis, and The Dark Tower“].&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] said he read the book "with avidity", and praised it as a work of philosophy, religion, and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookladysblog.com/2011/08/17/the-top-ten-books-that-influenced-j-r-r-tolkien/|title=thebookladysblog.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made widely available in paperback form when published as one of the precursor volumes to the [[Ballantine Adult Fantasy series]] in 1968.

From the early 1930s to late 1940s, an informal [[literary]] discussion group associated with the English faculty at the University of Oxford, were the "[[Inklings]]". Its leading members were the major [[high fantasy|fantasy]] novelists; [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]. Lewis is known for ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'' (1942), ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' (1950–1956) and ''[[The Space Trilogy]]'' (1938–1945), while Tolkien is best known as the author of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (1937), ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1954–1955), and ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' (1977).

===Later 20th-century===
In [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] writing, [[Ian Fleming]] created the character [[James Bond 007]] in January 1952, while on holiday at his Jamaican estate, Goldeneye. Fleming chronicled Bond's adventures in twelve novels, including ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' (1953), ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1954), ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'' (1958), ''[[Goldfinger (novel)|Goldfinger]]'' (1959), ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]'' (1961), ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1962), and nine short story works.

In contrast to the larger-than-life spy capers of Bond, [[John le Carré]] was an author of [[spy fiction|spy novels]] who depicted a shadowy world of espionage and counter-espionage, and his best known novel ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' (1963), is often regarded as one of the greatest in the genre. [[Frederick Forsyth]] writes thriller novels, including ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]'' (1971), ''[[The Odessa File]]'' (1972), ''[[The Dogs of War (novel)|The Dogs of War]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Fourth Protocol]]'' (1984). [[Ken Follett]] writes spy thrillers, his first success being ''[[Eye of the Needle (novel)|Eye of the Needle]]'' (1978), followed by ''[[The Key to Rebecca]]'' (1980), as well as historical novels, notably ''[[The Pillars of the Earth]]'' (1989), and its sequel ''[[World Without End (Follett novel)|World Without End]]'' (2007). [[Elleston Trevor]] is remembered for his 1964 adventure story ''[[The Flight of the Phoenix]]'', while the thriller novelist [[A. J. Quinnell|Philip Nicholson]] is best known for ''[[Man on Fire (Quinnell novel)|Man on Fire]]''. [[Peter George (author)|Peter George]]'s ''[[Red Alert (novel)|Red Alert]]'' (1958), is a Cold War thriller.

[[War novel]]s include [[Alistair MacLean]] thriller's ''[[The Guns of Navarone (novel)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1957), ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' (1968), and [[Jack Higgins]]' ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (novel)|The Eagle Has Landed]]'' (1975). [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s [[sea story|nautical]] historical novels feature the ''[[Aubrey–Maturin series]]'' set in the [[Royal Navy]], the first being ''[[Master and Commander]]'' (1969).

The "father of [[Wicca]]", [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], began propagating his own version of [[witchcraft]] in the 1950s. Having claimed to have been initiated into the [[New Forest coven]] in 1939, Gardner published his books ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959), the foundational texts for the religion of Wicca. [[Ronald Welch]]'s [[Carnegie Medal (literary award)|Carnegie Medal]] winning novel ''[[Knight Crusader]]'' is set in the 12th century and gives a depiction of the [[Third Crusade]], featuring the Christian leader and King of England [[Richard the Lionheart]].

In crime fiction, the [[murder mystery|murder mysteries]] of [[Ruth Rendell]] and [[P. D. James]] are popular.

[[Nigel Tranter]] wrote historical novels of celebrated Scottish warriors; [[Robert the Bruce]] in ''[[Historical novels by Nigel Tranter set between 1286 and 1603#Robert the Bruce trilogy|The Bruce Trilogy]]'', and [[William Wallace]] in ''[[Historical novels by Nigel Tranter set between 1286 and 1603#The Wallace|The Wallace]]'' (1975), works noted by academics for their accuracy.

His other major novels include ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'' (1972), and ''[[The Fountains of Paradise]]'' (1979). [[Brian Aldiss]] is Clarke's contemporary.

[[Michael Moorcock]] (born 1939) is a writer, primarily of science fiction and fantasy, who has also published a number of literary novels. He was involved with the 'New Wave' of science fiction writers "part of whose aim was to invest the genre with literary merit"&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', p. 674.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly [[J. G. Ballard]] (born 1930) "became known in the 1960s as the most prominent of the 'New Wave' science fiction writers".&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; A later major figure in science fiction was [[Iain M.

The '''Global Studies Consortium''' (GSC) is an international academic association of over 20 institutions of higher learning. It seeks to "promote and facilitate graduate teaching programs in [[global studies]] and to foster cooperation among them." &lt;ref&gt;[http://globalstudiesconsortium.org/info/by-laws By-Laws, Global Studies Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; That cooperation includes exchange of materials and development of methods to survey outcomes,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EOp0BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA374&amp;lpg=PA374&amp;dq=%22Global+Studies+Consortium%22+Tokyo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QeBuweU4Ql&amp;sig=80G_Z7C6oucuBMYCq2jAel-63Lk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiiwKbNivHKAhUDRCYKHarRCQg4ChDoAQhBMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Global%20Studies%20Consortium%22%20Tokyo&amp;f=false Lena Bader, et al.

The '''Guildhall Lectures''' were an annual series of talks on the theme of communication, organised by the [[British Association]].

The lectures, held in the [[London Guildhall]], were sponsored and broadcast by [[Granada Television]].  The first set of three lectures were held in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs, ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom, Vol. 5'', p.457&lt;/ref&gt; and they continued until at least 1984.  Broadly on the theme of "Communication in the Modern World", they concerned the [[arts]], [[science]]s, [[politics]] and [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Curran et al, ''Television Today and Tomorrow'', p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1818">A HRG [[gyrocompass]] is a [[compass]] and instrument of [[navigation]]. It is the latest generation of maintenance free instrument.

The HRG gyrocompass is a complete unit, which unlike a conventional compass, has no rotating or other moving parts. It uses [[Hemispherical resonator gyroscope|Hemispherical Resonant gyroscope]], accelerometers and computers to compute [[True north]]. It has an outstanding reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/project/HRG-by-SAFRAN-The-game-changing-technology|title=HRG by SAFRAN The game-changing technology|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its operational [[Mean Time Between Failure]] (MTBF) values are improved over a [[Fibre optic gyrocompass|Fiber Optic Gyrocompass]] and also conventional mechanical gyrocompass. 
The HRG gyrocompass is also immune to several environmental conditions.

'''Herd behavior''' describes how individuals in a group can act collectively without centralized direction. The term can refer to the [[behavior]] of animals in [[herd]]s, [[Pack (canine)|packs]], [[bird flock]]s, [[fish school]]s and so on, as well as the behavior of humans in demonstrations, [[riots]] and [[general strikes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Braha | first1 = D | year = 2012 | title = Global Civil Unrest: Contagion, Self-Organization, and Prediction. | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 10| page = e48596 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0048596 | pmid=23119067 | pmc=3485346}}&lt;/ref&gt; sporting events, religious gatherings, episodes of mob violence and everyday decision-making, judgement and opinion-forming.

Raafat, Chater and Frith proposed an integrated approach to herding, describing two key issues, the mechanisms of transmission of thoughts or behavior between individuals and the patterns of connections between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raafat |first=R. M. |last2=Chater |first2=N. |last3=Frith |first3=C. |title=Herding in humans |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |year=2009 |volume=13 |issue=10 |pages=420–428 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They suggested that bringing together diverse theoretical approaches of herding behavior illuminates the applicability of the concept to many domains, ranging from cognitive neuroscience to economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burke |first=C. J. |last2=Tobler |first2=P. N. |last3=Schultz |first3=W. |last4=Baddeley |first4=M. |doi=10.3389/fnhum.2010.00048 |title=Striatal BOLD response reflects the impact of herd information on financial decisions |journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience |year=2010 |volume=4 |page=48 |pmid=20589242 |pmc=2892997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In animals==
[[File:Stereoscopic-motion-analysis-in-densely-packed-clusters-3D-analysis-of-the-shimmering-behaviour-in-1742-9994-8-3-S1.ogv|thumb|[[Shimmering behaviour]] of ''[[Apis dorsata]]'' (giant honeybees)]]
A group of animals fleeing from a predator shows the nature of herd behavior. In 1971, in the oft cited article "Geometry For The Selfish Herd", [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[W. D. Hamilton]] asserted that each individual group member reduces the danger to itself by moving as close as possible to the center of the fleeing group. Thus the herd appears as a unit in moving together, but its function emerges from the uncoordinated behavior of self-serving individuals.&lt;ref name="hamilton"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=W. D. |last=Hamilton |year=1971 |title=Geometry for the Selfish Herd |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=295–311 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(71)90189-5 |pmid=5104951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symmetry-breaking==
Asymmetric aggregation of animals under panic conditions has been observed in many species, including humans, mice, and ants.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0401/0401124.pdf|title= Panic-induced symmetry breaking in escaping ants|first1=E.|last1=Altshuler|first2=O.|last2=Ramos|first3=Y.|last3=Nuñez|first4=J.|last4=Fernández|location=[[University of Havana]], [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-05-18}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical models have demonstrated symmetry-breaking similar to observations in empirical studies. For example, when panicked individuals are confined to a room with two equal and equidistant exits, a majority will favor one exit while the minority will favor the other.

Possible mechanisms for this behavior include [[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]]’s [[selfish herd theory]], neighbor copying, or the byproduct of communication by social animals or runaway positive feedback.

Characteristics of escape panic include:

* Individuals attempt to move faster than normal.
* Interactions between individuals become physical.
* Exits become arched and clogged.
* Escape is slowed by fallen individuals serving as obstacles.
* Individuals display a tendency towards mass or copied behavior.
* Alternative or less used exits are overlooked.&lt;ref name="hamilton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altshuler | first1 = E. | last2 = Ramos | first2 = O. | last3 = Núñez | first3 = Y. | last4 = Fernández | first4 = J. | last5 = Batista-Leyva | first5 = A.

==In human societies==
The philosophers [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] were among the first to criticize what they referred to as "the crowd" (Kierkegaard) and "herd morality" and the "herd instinct" (Nietzsche) in human society. Modern [[psychology|psychological]] and [[economics|economic]] research has identified herd behavior in humans to explain the phenomenon of large numbers of people acting in the same way at the same time. The British surgeon [[Wilfred Trotter]] popularized the "herd behavior" phrase in his book, ''[[Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War]]'' (1914). In ''[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]]'', [[Thorstein Veblen]] explained economic behavior in terms of social influences such as "emulation," where some members of a group mimic other members of higher status. In "The Metropolis and Mental Life" (1903), early sociologist [[George Simmel]] referred to the "impulse to sociability in man", and sought to describe "the forms of association by which a mere sum of separate individuals are made into a 'society'&amp;nbsp;". Other social scientists explored behaviors related to herding, such as [[Sigmund Freud]] (crowd psychology), [[Carl Jung]] (collective unconscious), [[Everett Dean Martin]] (Behavior of Crowds) and [[Gustave Le Bon]] (the popular mind).
[[Swarm theory]] observed in non-human societies is a related concept and is being explored as it occurs in human society.

===Stock market bubbles===
Large stock market trends often begin and end with periods of frenzied buying (bubbles) or selling (crashes). Many observers cite these episodes as clear examples of herding behavior that is irrational and driven by emotion—greed in the bubbles, fear in the crashes. Individual investors join the crowd of others in a rush to get in or out of the market.&lt;ref&gt;[[Markus K. Brunnermeier]], [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Economics/Business/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780198296980 Asset ''Pricing under Asymmetric Information: Bubbles, Crashes, Technical Analysis, and Herding''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102846/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Economics/Business/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780198296980 |date=2007-09-29 }}, Oxford University Press (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Some followers of the [[technical analysis]] school of investing see the herding behavior of investors as an example of extreme [[market sentiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Prechter, ''The Wave Principle of Human Social Behavior'', New Classics Library (1999), pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; The academic study of [[behavioral finance]] has identified herding in the collective irrationality of investors, particularly the work of [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureates [[Vernon L. Smith]], [[Amos Tversky]], [[Daniel Kahneman]], and [[Robert Shiller]].&lt;ref name=Shiller2000&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert J. |last=Shiller |title=Irrational Exuberance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djq5RWiUN6oC&amp;printsec=frontcover |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2000 |pages=149–153 |isbn= |accessdate=4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|a|a|none}}

Hey and Morone (2004) analyzed a model of herd behavior in a market context. Their work is related to at least two important strands of literature. The first of these strands is that on herd behavior in a non-market context. The seminal references are [[Abhijit Banerjee|Banerjee]] (1992) and Bikhchandani, [[David Hirshleifer|Hirshleifer]] and [[Ivo Welch|Welch]] (1992), both of which showed that herd behavior may result from private information not publicly shared. More specifically, both of these papers showed that individuals, acting sequentially on the basis of private information and public knowledge about the behavior of others, may end up choosing the socially undesirable option. The second of the strands of literature motivating this paper is that of information aggregation in market contexts. A very early reference is the classic paper by Grossman and Stiglitz (1976) that showed that uninformed traders in a market context can become informed through the price in such a way that private information is aggregated correctly and efficiently. In this strand of the literature, the most commonly used empirical methodologies to test for herding toward the average, are the works of Christie and Huang (1995) and Chang, Cheng and Khorana (2000). Overall, it was shown that it is possible to observe herd-type behavior in a market context. The results refer to a market with a well-defined fundamental value. Even if herd behavior might only be observed rarely, this has important consequences for a whole range of real markets – most particularly foreign exchange markets.

One such herdish incident was the price volatility that surrounded the [[Uranium bubble of 2007|2007 Uranium bubble]], which started with flooding of the [[Cigar Lake Mine]] in [[Saskatchewan]], during the year 2006.&lt;ref name=NuclearMarketReview2012&gt;{{citation |date=8 June 2012 |author=In Focus article |title=Reproduced article from Nuclear Market Review|chapter=WNFM: A Focus on Fundamentals One Year After Fukushima |publisher=TradeTech |chapter-url=http://www.uranium.info/market_analyses.php |accessdate=4 March 2013 |postscript=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There are several reproduced In Focus articles on this page.

===In crowds===
{{Main|Crowd psychology}}
Crowds that gather on behalf of a grievance can involve herding behavior that turns violent, particularly when confronted by an opposing ethnic or racial group. The [[Los Angeles riots of 1992]], [[New York Draft Riots]] and [[Tulsa Race Riot]] are notorious in U.S. history. The idea of a "group mind" or "mob behavior" was put forward by the [[France|French]] social psychologists [[Gabriel Tarde]] and [[Gustave Le Bon]].

===Everyday decision-making===
"Benign" herding behaviors may occur frequently in everyday decisions based on learning from the information of others, as when a person on the street decides which of two restaurants to dine in. Suppose that both look appealing, but both are empty because it is early evening; so at random, this person chooses restaurant A. Soon a couple walks down the same street in search of a place to eat. They see that restaurant A has customers while B is empty, and choose A on the assumption that having customers makes it the better choice. Because other passersby do the same thing into the evening, restaurant A does more business that night than B. This phenomenon is also referred as an [[information cascade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Abhijit V. |last=Banerjee |year=1992 |title=A Simple Model of Herd Behavior |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=107 |issue=3 |pages=797–817 |doi=10.2307/2118364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Sushil |last=Bikhchandani |authorlink2=David Hirshleifer |first2=David |last2=Hirshleifer |authorlink3=Ivo Welch |first3=Ivo |last3=Welch |year=1992 |title=A Theory of Fads, Fashion, Custom, and Cultural Change as Informational Cascades |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=100 |issue=5 |pages=992–1026 |doi=10.1086/261849 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Froot | first1 = K | last2 = Schaferstein | first2 = DS | last3 = Jeremy Stein | first3 = J | year = 1992 | title = Herd on the street: Informational inefficiencies in a market with short-term speculation | url = http://www.people.hbs.edu/kfroot/oldwebsite/cvpaperlinks/herd_on_the_street.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Finance | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 1461–1484 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1992.tb04665.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirshleifer | first1 = D | last2 = Teoh | first2 = SH | year = 2003 | title = Herd behaviour and cascading in capital markets: A review and synthesis | url = http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/5186/1/MPRA_paper_5186.pdf | format = PDF | journal = European Financial Management | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 25–66 | doi = 10.1111/1468-036X.00207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In marketing ==
Herd behavior is often a useful tool in [[marketing]] and, if used properly, can lead to increases in sales and changes to the [[Social structure|structure of society]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Whilst it has been shown that financial incentives cause action in large numbers of people, herd mentality often wins out in a case of "Keeping up with the Joneses".

=== In brand and product success ===
Communications technologies have contributed to the proliferation to [[consumer choice]] and "the power of crowds",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Chen|first = Yi-Fen|date = 2008-09-01|title = Herd behavior in purchasing books online|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563207001458|journal = Computers in Human Behavior|series = Including the Special Issue: Internet Empowerment|volume = 24|issue = 5|pages = 1977–1992|doi = 10.1016/j.chb.2007.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers increasingly have more access to opinions and information from both [[opinion leader]]s and formers on platforms that have largely [[user-generated content]], and thus have more tools with which to complete any [[decision-making]] process. [[Popularity]] is seen as an indication of better quality, and consumers will use the opinions of others posted on these platforms as a powerful compass to guide them towards products and brands that align with their preconceptions and the decisions of others in their [[peer group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Lessig|first = V|date = 1977|title = Students and Housewives: Differences in Susceptibility to Reference Group Influence|url =|journal = Journal of Consumer Research|doi =10.1086/208685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking into account differences in needs and their position in the [[socialization]] process, Lessig &amp; Park examined groups of students and housewives and the influence that these reference groups have on one another. By way of herd mentality, students tended to encourage each other towards beer, hamburger and cigarettes, whilst [[housewives]] tended to encourage each other towards furniture and detergent. Whilst this particular study was done in 1977, one cannot discount its findings in today's society. A study done by Burke, Leykin, Li and Zhang in 2014 on the [[social influence]] on shopper behavior shows that shoppers are influenced by direct interactions with companions, and as a group size grows, herd behaviour becomes more apparent. Discussions that create excitement and interest have greater impact on touch frequency and purchase likelihood grows with greater involvement caused by a large group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Zhang|first = Xiaoling|last2 = Li|first2 = Shibo|last3 = Burke|first3 = Raymond R.|last4 = Leykin|first4 = Alex|date = 2014-05-13|title = An Examination of Social Influence on Shopper Behavior Using Video Tracking Data|url = http://journals.ama.org/doi/abs/10.1509/jm.12.0106|journal = Journal of Marketing|volume = 78|issue = 5|pages = 24–41|doi = 10.1509/jm.12.0106|issn = 0022-2429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoppers in this Midwestern American shopping outlet were monitored and their purchases noted, and it was found up to a point, potential customers preferred to be in stores which had moderate levels of traffic. The other people in the store not only served as company, but also provided an inference point on which potential customers could model their behavior and make [[purchase decision]]s, as with any reference group or community.

[[Social media]] can also be a powerful tool in perpetuating herd behaviour.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Its immeasurable amount of user-generated content serves as a platform for opinion leaders to take the stage and influence purchase decisions, and recommendations from peers and evidence of positive online experience all serve to help consumers make purchasing decisions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Dhar|first = Joydip|last2 = Jha|first2 = Abhishek Kumar|date = 2014-10-03|title = Analyzing Social Media Engagement and its Effect on Online Product Purchase Decision Behavior|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10911359.2013.876376|journal = Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment|volume = 24|issue = 7|pages = 791–798|doi = 10.1080/10911359.2013.876376|issn = 1091-1359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunawan and Huarng's 2015 study concluded that social influence is essential in [[framing (social sciences)|framing]] attitudes towards brands, which in turn leads to purchase intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Gunawan|first = Dedy Darsono|last2 = Huarng|first2 = Kun-Huang|date = 2015-11-01|title = Viral effects of social network and media on consumers' purchase intention|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296315002325|journal = Journal of Business Research|volume = 68|issue = 11|pages = 2237–2241|doi = 10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influencers form norms which their peers are found to follow, and targeting [[extrovert]]ed personalities increases chances of purchase even further.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is because the stronger personalities tend to be more engaged on consumer platforms and thus spread word of mouth information more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Cheung|first = Christy M. K.|last2 = Xiao|first2 = Bo Sophia|last3 = Liu|first3 = Ivy L. B.|date = 2014-09-01|title = Do actions speak louder than voices? The signaling role of social information cues in influencing consumer purchase decisions|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923614001420|journal = Decision Support Systems|series = Crowdsourcing and Social Networks Analysis|volume = 65|pages = 50–58|doi = 10.1016/j.dss.2014.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many brands have begun to realise the importance of brand ambassadors and influencers, and it is being shown more clearly that herd behaviour can be used to drive sales and profits exponentially in favour of any brand through examination of these instances.

=== In social marketing ===
Marketing can easily transcend beyond commercial roots, in that it can be used to encourage [[activism|action]] to do with health, [[environmentalism]] and general society. Herd mentality often takes a front seat when it comes to [[social marketing]], paving the way for [[Civil society campaign|campaign]]s such as [[Earth Day]], and the variety of anti-smoking and anti-obesity campaigns seen in every country. Within cultures and communities, marketers must aim to influence opinion leaders who in turn influence each other,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = James M. Cronin|last2 = Mary B. McCarthy|date = 2011-07-12|title = Preventing game over: A study of the situated food choice influences within the videogames subculture|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/20426761111141887|journal = Journal of Social Marketing|volume = 1|issue = 2|pages = 133–153|doi = 10.1108/20426761111141887|issn = 2042-6763}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is the herd mentality of any group of people that ensures a social campaign's success. A campaign run by Som la Pera in Spain to combat teenage obesity found that campaigns run in schools are more effective due to influence of teachers and peers, and students' high visibility, and their interaction with one another. Opinion leaders in schools created the logo and branding for the campaign, built content for social media and led in-school presentations to engage audience interaction. It was thus concluded that the success of the campaign was rooted in the fact that its means of communication was the audience itself, giving the target audience a sense of ownership and empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Lozano|first = Natàlia|last2 = Prades|first2 = Jordi|last3 = Montagut|first3 = Marta|date = 2015-10-01|title = Som la Pera: How to develop a social marketing and public relations campaign to prevent obesity among teenagers in Catalonia|url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/cjcs/2015/00000007/00000002/art00009?token=00531b149b5bd549bde7e41225f4038382c2b672148783b774450576b34272c5f7b3d6d3f4e4b34f5a7|journal = Catalan Journal of Communication &amp; Cultural Studies|volume = 7|issue = 2|pages = 251–259|doi = 10.1386/cjcs.7.2.251_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned previously, students exert a high level of influence over one another, and by encouraging stronger personalities to lead opinions, the organizers of the campaign were able to secure the attention of other students who identified with the reference group.

Herd behaviour not only applies to students in schools where they are highly visible, but also amongst communities where perceived action plays a strong role. Between 2003 and 2004, California State University carried out a study to measure household [[energy saving|conservation of energy]], and motivations for doing so. It was found that factors like saving the environment, saving money or [[social responsibility]] did not have as great an impact on each household as the perceived behaviour of their neighbours did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Nolan|first = Jessica M.|last2 = Schultz|first2 = P.

Herd behaviours shown in the two examples exemplify that it can be a powerful tool in social marketing, and if harnessed correctly, has the potential to achieve great change. It is clear that opinion leaders and their influence achieve huge reach among their reference groups and thus can be used as the loudest voices to encourage others in any collective direction.

[[File:Wind turbine 1888 Charles Brush.jpg|thumb| [[Charles F. Brush|Charles Brush's]] windmill of 1888, used for generating electricity.]]

'''[[Wind power]]''' has been used as long as humans have put [[sailing ships|sails]] into the wind. For more than two millennia [[Windmill|wind-powered machines]] have ground grain and pumped water. Wind power was widely available and not confined to the banks of fast-flowing streams, or later, requiring sources of fuel. Wind-powered pumps drained the [[Polder#Polders and the Netherlands|polders of the Netherlands]], and in arid regions such as the [[American mid-west]] or the [[Australian outback]], [[wind pump]]s provided water for livestock and steam engines.

With the development of electric power, wind power found new applications in lighting buildings remote from centrally-generated power. Throughout the 20th century parallel paths developed small wind plants suitable for farms or residences, and larger utility-scale wind generators that could be connected to electricity grids for remote use of power. Today wind powered generators operate in every size range between tiny plants for battery charging at isolated residences, up to near-gigawatt sized [[List of offshore wind farms|offshore wind farms]] that provide electricity to national electrical networks.

By 2014, over 240,000 commercial-sized wind turbines were operating in the world, producing 4% of the world's electricity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.gwec.net/global-figures/wind-in-numbers/ Wind in numbers], Global Wind Energy Council&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wwea2014&gt;{{cite book |author=The World Wind Energy Association |title=2014 Half-year Report |year=2014|pages=1–8 |publisher=WWEA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sailboats]] and [[sailing ship]]s have been using wind power for at least 5,500 years,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and architects have used wind-driven [[natural ventilation]] in buildings since similarly ancient times. The use of wind to provide mechanical power came somewhat later in antiquity.

The [[Babylonia]]n emperor [[Hammurabi]] planned to use wind power for his ambitious irrigation project in the 17th century BC.&lt;ref name="Sathyajith2006"&gt;

The first practical [[windmill]]s were in use in [[Sistan]], a region in [[Iran]] and bordering [[Afghanistan]], at least by the 9th century and possibly as early as the 7th century. These "[[Panemone windmill]]s" were horizontal windmills,{{ref|a|[note 1]}} which had long vertical [[driveshaft]]s with six to twelve rectangular [[Windmill sail|sail]]s covered in reed matting or cloth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [[Donald Routledge Hill]] (1986).

&lt;/ref&gt; The use of windmills became widespread across the Middle East and Central Asia, and later spread to China and [[Indian subcontinent|India]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, p. 64-69.

Wind-powered [[Automaton|automata]] are known from the mid-8th century: wind-powered [[statue]]s that "turned with the wind over the domes of the four gates and the palace complex of the Round City of [[Baghdad]]". The "Green Dome of the palace was surmounted by the statue of a horseman carrying a lance that was believed to point toward the enemy. This public spectacle of wind-powered statues had its private counterpart in the '[[Abbasid]] palaces where automata of various types were predominantly displayed."&lt;ref&gt;

The first windmills in [[Europe]] appear in sources dating to the twelfth century. These early European windmills were  [[post mill|sunk post mills]]. The earliest certain reference to a windmill dates from 1185, in Weedley, Yorkshire, although a number of earlier but less certainly dated twelfth-century European sources referring to windmills have also been adduced.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White Jr., ''Medieval technology and social change'' (Oxford, 1962) p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is sometimes argued that [[the Crusades|crusaders]] may have been inspired by windmills in the Middle East, this is unlikely since the European vertical windmills were of significantly different design than the horizontal windmills of Afghanistan. Lynn White Jr., a specialist in medieval European technology, asserts that the European windmill was an "independent invention;" he argues that it is unlikely that the Afghanistan-style horizontal windmill had spread as far west as the Levant during the Crusader period.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White Jr. ''Medieval technology and social change'' (Oxford, 1962) p. 86-87, 161-162.&lt;/ref&gt;  In medieval England rights to waterpower sites were often confined to nobility and clergy, so wind power was an important resource to a new middle class.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Wind Energy'' in ''Energy Encyclopedia Vol. 6'', page 420&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, windmills, unlike water mills, were not rendered inoperable by the freezing of water in the winter.

By the 14th century Dutch [[windmill]]s were in use to drain areas of the [[Rhine River]] delta.

The first wind turbine used for the production of electricity was built in Scotland in July 1887 by [[Prof James Blyth]] of [[Anderson's College]], Glasgow (the precursor of [[Strathclyde University]]).&lt;ref name="Price"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Price |first=Trevor J |title=James Blyth - Britain's First Modern Wind Power Engineer |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mscp/wind/2005/00000029/00000003/art00002 |journal=Wind Engineering |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=191–200 |date=3 May 2005 |doi=10.1260/030952405774354921 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Blyth's 10 m high, cloth-sailed wind turbine was installed in the garden of his holiday cottage at [[Marykirk]] in [[Kincardineshire]] and was used to charge [[accumulator (energy)|accumulator]]s developed by the Frenchman [[Camille Alphonse Faure]], to power the lighting in the cottage,&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; thus making it the first house in the world to have its electricity supplied by wind power.&lt;ref name="Shackleton"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Blyth offered the surplus electricity to the people of Marykirk for lighting the main street, however, they turned down the offer as they thought electricity was "the work of the devil."&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; Although he later built a wind turbine to supply emergency power to the local Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], the invention never really caught on as the technology was not considered to be economically viable.&lt;ref name="Price" /&gt;

Across the Atlantic, in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] a larger and heavily engineered machine was designed and constructed in the winter of 1887-1888 by [[Charles F. Brush]],&lt;ref&gt;[Anon, 1890, 'Mr. Brush's Windmill Dynamo', Scientific American, vol 63 no. 25, 20 December, p. 54]&lt;/ref&gt; this was built by his engineering company at his home and operated from 1886 until 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windpower.org/en/pictures/brush.htm A Wind Energy Pioneer: Charles F.

Accessed 2 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brush wind turbine had a rotor 17 m (56 foot) in diameter and was mounted on an 18 m (60 foot) tower. Although large by today's standards, the machine was only rated at 12&amp;nbsp;kW; it turned relatively slowly since it had 144 blades. The connected dynamo was used either to charge a bank of batteries or to operate up to 100 [[incandescent light bulb]]s, three arc lamps, and various motors in Brush's laboratory. The machine fell into disuse after 1900 when electricity became available from Cleveland's central stations, and was abandoned in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Wind Energy'' in Cutler J. Cleveland,(ed) ''Encyclopedia of Energy Vol.6'', Elsevier, {{ISBN|978-1-60119-433-6}}, 2007, pp. 421-422&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 [[Denmark|Danish]] scientist, [[Poul la Cour]], constructed a wind turbine to generate electricity, which was used to produce [[hydrogen]]&lt;ref name="Price"/&gt; by [[electrolysis]] to be stored for use in experiments and to light the Askov High school. He later solved the problem of producing a steady supply of power by inventing a regulator, the Kratostate, and in 1895 converted his windmill into a prototype electrical power plant that was used to light the village of Askov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historybecauseitshere.weebly.com/poul-la-cour-pioneered-wind-mill-power-in-denmark.html|title=Poul la Cour Pioneered Wind Mill Power in Denmark|last=Warnes|first=Kathy|work=History, because it's there|accessdate=20 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129092021/http://historybecauseitshere.weebly.com/poul-la-cour-pioneered-wind-mill-power-in-denmark.html|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Denmark there were about 2,500 windmills by 1900, used for mechanical loads such as pumps and mills, producing an estimated combined peak power of about 30 MW.

In the American midwest between 1850 and 1900, a large number of small windmills, perhaps six million, were installed on farms to operate irrigation pumps.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Wind Energy'' in ''Encyclopedia of Energy'',pg. 421&lt;/ref&gt;  Firms such as Star, Eclipse, [[Fairbanks-Morse]], and [[Aeromotor]] became famed suppliers in North and South America.

== 20th century ==

Development in the 20th century might be usefully divided into the periods:
* 1900–1973, when widespread use of individual wind generators competed against fossil fuel plants and centrally-generated electricity
* 1973–onward, when the [[1973 oil crisis|oil price crisis]] spurred investigation of non-petroleum energy sources.

=== 1900–1973 ===

==== Danish development ====
In Denmark wind power was an important part of a decentralized electrification in the first quarter of the 20th century, partly because of Poul la Cour from his first practical development in 1891 at Askov. By 1908 there were 72 wind-driven electric generators from 5&amp;nbsp;kW to 25&amp;nbsp;kW. The largest machines were on 24&amp;nbsp;m (79&amp;nbsp;ft) towers with four-bladed 23&amp;nbsp;m (75&amp;nbsp;ft) diameter rotors.&lt;ref name=EncycEnergy /&gt; In 1957 [[Johannes Juul]] installed a 24 m diameter [[Gedser wind turbine|wind turbine at Gedser]], which ran from 1957 until 1967.  This was a three-bladed, horizontal-axis, upwind, stall-regulated turbine similar to those now used for commercial wind power development.&lt;ref name=EncycEnergy&gt;''History of Wind Energy'' in ''Encyclopedia of Energy Vol. 6'', page 426&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Farm power and isolated plants ====
In 1927 the brothers Joe Jacobs and Marcellus Jacobs opened a factory, [[Jacobs Wind]] in [[Minneapolis]] to produce wind turbine generators for farm use.  These would typically be used for lighting or battery charging, on farms out of reach of central-station electricity and distribution lines. In 30 years the firm produced about 30,000 small wind turbines, some of which ran for many years in remote locations in Africa and on the [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]] expedition to [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;''History of Wind Energy'' in ''Energy Encyclopedia vol. 6'', page 422&lt;/ref&gt; Many other manufacturers produced small wind turbine sets for the same market, including companies called Wincharger, Miller Airlite, Universal Aeroelectric, Paris-Dunn, Airline and Winpower.

In 1931 the [[Darrieus wind turbine]] was invented, with its [[Wind turbine#Vertical axis design|vertical axis]] providing a different mix of design tradeoffs from the conventional horizontal-axis wind turbine. The vertical orientation accepts wind from any direction with no need for adjustments, and the heavy generator and gearbox equipment can rest on the ground instead of atop a tower.

By the 1930s windmills were widely used to generate electricity on farms in the United States where distribution systems had not yet been installed. Used to replenish battery storage banks, these machines typically had generating capacities of a few hundred watts to several kilowatts. Beside providing farm power, they were also used for isolated applications such as [[cathodic protection|electrifying]] bridge structures to prevent corrosion. In this period, high tensile steel was cheap, and windmills were placed atop prefabricated open steel [[lattice tower]]s.

The most widely used small wind generator produced for American farms in the 1930s was a two-bladed horizontal-axis machine manufactured by the Wincharger Corporation. It had a peak output of 200 watts. Blade speed was regulated by curved air brakes near the hub that deployed at excessive rotational velocities. These machines were still being manufactured in the United States during the 1980s. In 1936, the U.S. started a [[Rural Utilities Service|rural electrification]] project that killed the natural market for wind-generated power, since network power distribution provided a farm with more dependable usable energy for a given amount of capital investment.

In Australia, the Dunlite Corporation built hundreds of small wind generators to provide power at isolated postal service stations and farms. These machines were manufactured from 1936 until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pearen.ca/dunlite/Dunlite.htm Dunlite history page Retrieved 28 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Utility-scale turbines ====
[[File:Wind turbine 1941.jpg|thumb|The world's first megawatt-sized wind turbine near Grandpa's Knob Summit,&lt;!-- yes, this is the real name for the [http://www.mountainzone.com/mountains/detail.asp?fid=3618456 mountain] the turbine was built on -see the citation- --&gt;, [[Castleton, Vermont]].&lt;ref name=NP /&gt;]]
[[File:Eolienne 006 02.jpg|thumb|right|Experimental wind turbine at [[Nogent-le-Roi]], France, 1955.]]

A forerunner of modern horizontal-axis utility-scale wind generators was the WIME D-30 in service in [[Balaklava]], near [[Yalta]], [[USSR]] from 1931 until 1942. This was a 100&amp;nbsp;kW generator on a 30&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft) tower, connected to the local 6.3 kV distribution system. It had a three-bladed 30 metre rotor on a steel lattice tower.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Hau, ''Wind turbines: fundamentals, technologies, application, economics'', Birkhäuser, 2006 {{ISBN|3-540-24240-6}}, page 32, with a photo&lt;/ref&gt;  It was reported to have an annual [[load factor (electrical)|load factor]] of 32 per cent,&lt;ref&gt;Alan Wyatt, Electric Power: Challenges and Choices,(1986),Book Press Ltd., Toronto, {{ISBN|0-920650-00-7}} , page NN&lt;/ref&gt; not much different from current wind machines.&lt;ref&gt;See also Robert W. Righter ''Wind energy in America: a history'' page 127 which gives a slightly different description.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941 the [[Smith-Putnam wind turbine|world's first megawatt-size wind turbine]] was connected to the local electrical distribution system on the mountain known as Grandpa's Knob in [[Castleton, Vermont]], United States. It was designed by [[Palmer Cosslett Putnam]] and manufactured by the S. Morgan Smith Company.  This 1.25 MW Smith-Putnam turbine operated for 1100 hours before a blade failed at a known weak point, which had not been reinforced due to war-time material shortages. No similar-sized unit was to repeat this "bold experiment" for about forty years.&lt;ref name=NP&gt;[http://www.noblepower.com/our-windparks/GrandpasKnob/documents/07.09.12-NEP-GPKHistoryHandout-G.pdf The Return of Windpower to Grandpa's Knob and Rutland County] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828170455/http://www.noblepower.com/our-windparks/GrandpasKnob/documents/07.09.12-NEP-GPKHistoryHandout-G.pdf |date=28 August 2008 }}, Noble Environmental Power, LLC, 12 November 2007.

==== Fuel-saving turbines ====
During the [[Second World War]], small wind generators were used on German U-boats to recharge submarine batteries as a fuel-conserving measure. In 1946 the [[Great Tower Neuwerk|lighthouse]] and residences on the island of [[Neuwerk]] were partly powered by an 18&amp;nbsp;kW wind turbine 15 metres in diameter, to economize on diesel fuel. This installation ran for around 20 years before being replaced by a submarine cable to the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitri R. Stein, '' Pioneer in the North Sea: 1946 Insel Neuwerk Turbine'', in ''IEEE Power and Energy Magazine'', September/October 2009, pp. 62-68&lt;/ref&gt;

The Station d'Etude de l'Energie du Vent at [[Nogent-le-Roi]] in France operated an experimental 800 KVA wind turbine from 1956 to 1966.&lt;ref name="cavey2004"&gt;

=== 1973–2000 ===

==== US development ====
From 1974 through the mid-1980s the United States government worked with industry to advance the technology and enable large commercial wind turbines. The [[NASA wind turbines]] were developed under a program to create a utility-scale wind turbine industry in the U.S. With funding from the [[National Science Foundation]] and later the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE), a total of 13 experimental wind turbines were put into operation, in four major wind turbine designs. This research and development program pioneered many of the multi-megawatt turbine technologies in use today, including: steel tube towers, variable-speed generators, composite blade materials, partial-span pitch control, as well as aerodynamic, structural, and acoustic engineering design capabilities. The large wind turbines developed under this effort set several world records for diameter and power output. The MOD-2 wind turbine cluster of three turbines produced 7.5 megawatts of power in 1981. In 1987, the MOD-5B was the largest single wind turbine operating in the world with a rotor diameter of nearly 100 meters and a rated power of 3.2 megawatts.  It demonstrated an availability of 95 percent, an unparalleled level for a new first-unit wind turbine. The MOD-5B had the first large-scale variable speed drive train and a sectioned, two-blade rotor that enabled easy transport of the blades. The 4 megawatt WTS-4 held the world record for power output for over 20 years. Although the later units were sold commercially, none of these two-bladed machines were ever put into mass production. When oil prices declined by a factor of three from 1980 through the early 1990s,&lt;ref name=OilHistory&gt;[[Price of petroleum]],&lt;/ref&gt; many turbine manufacturers, both large and small, left the business. The commercial sales of the NASA/Boeing Mod-5B, for example, came to an end in 1987 when Boeing Engineering and Construction announced they were "planning to leave the market because low oil prices are keeping windmills for electricity generation uneconomical."&lt;ref name=BoeingLeaves&gt;http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1987/8701230009.asp{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Hawaiians get Boeing's Last Wind Machine Makani Ho'Olapa will Bring Power to 1,140 Residences'' 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in the 1980s, [[California]] provided [[tax rebate]]s for wind power. These rebates funded the first major use of wind power for utility electricity. These machines, gathered in large wind parks such as at [[Altamont Pass]] would be considered small and un-economic by modern wind power development standards.

====Danish development====

A giant change took place in 1978 when the world's [[:da:Vindkraftværket Tvindkraft|first multi-megawatt wind turbine]] was constructed. It pioneered many technologies used in modern wind turbines and allowed Vestas, Siemens and others to get the parts they needed. Especially important was the novel wing construction using help from German aeronautics specialists. The power plant was capable of delivering 2MW, had a tubular tower, pitch controlled wings and three blades. It was built by the teachers and students of the Tvind school. Before completion these "amateurs" were much ridiculed. The turbine still runs today and looks almost identical to the newest most modern mills.

Danish commercial wind power development stressed incremental improvements in capacity and efficiency based on extensive serial production of turbines, in contrast with development models requiring extensive steps in unit size based primarily on theoretical extrapolation.  A practical consequence is that all commercial wind turbines resemble the ''Danish model'', a light-weight three-blade upwind design.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gipe '' Wind Energy Comes of Age'', John Wiley and Sons, 1995 {{ISBN|0-471-10924-X}}, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

All major [[Wind turbine#Horizontal axis|horizontal axis]] turbines today rotate the same way (clockwise) to present a coherent view. However, early turbines rotated counter-clockwise like the old windmills, but a shift occurred from 1978 and on. The individualist-minded [[Wind turbine design#Blades|blade]] supplier Økær made the decision to change direction in order to be distinguished from the [[collective]] [[Tvind]] and their small wind turbines. Some of the blade customers were companies that later evolved into [[Vestas]], [[Siemens]], [[Enercon]] and [[Nordex]]. Public demand required that all turbines rotate the same way, and the success of these companies made clockwise the new standard.&lt;ref name="woc77-81"&gt;Grove-Nielsen, Erik. [http://www.windsofchange.dk/WOC-77-81.php Økær Vind Energi 1977 - 1981] ''Winds of Change''. Retrieved: 1 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Self-sufficiency and back-to-the-land ====
In the 1970s many people began to desire a self-sufficient life-style. [[Solar cell]]s were too expensive for small-scale electrical generation, so some turned to windmills. At first they built ad-hoc designs using wood and automobile parts. Most people discovered that a reliable wind generator is a moderately complex engineering project, well beyond the ability of most amateurs. Some began to search for and rebuild farm wind generators from the 1930s, of which Jacobs Wind Electric Company machines were especially sought after. Hundreds of Jacobs machines were reconditioned and sold during the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Following experience with reconditioned 1930s wind turbines, a new generation of American manufacturers started building and selling small wind turbines not only for battery-charging but also for interconnection to electricity networks. An early example would be Enertech Corporation of Norwich, Vermont, which began building 1.8&amp;nbsp;kW models in the early 1980s.

In the 1990s, as aesthetics and durability became more important, turbines were placed atop tubular steel or reinforced concrete towers. Small generators are connected to the tower on the ground, then the tower is raised into position. Larger generators are hoisted into position atop the tower and there is a ladder or staircase inside the tower to allow technicians to reach and maintain the generator, while protected from the weather.

== 21st century ==
[[File:Wind turbine size increase 1980-2011.png|thumb|Size comparison of modern wind turbines]]

As the 21st century began, fossil fuel was still relatively cheap, but rising concerns over [[energy security]], [[global warming]], and eventual [[peak oil|fossil fuel depletion]] led to an expansion of interest in all available forms of [[renewable energy]]. The fledgling commercial wind power industry began expanding at a robust growth rate of about 25% per year, driven by the ready availability of large wind resources, and falling costs due to improved technology and wind farm management.&lt;ref name=re&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/03/btm-forecasts-340-gw-of-wind-by-2013?src=rss |title=BTM Forecasts 340-GW of Wind Energy by 2013 |publisher=Renewableenergyworld.com |date=27 March 2009 |accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The steady run-up in [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil prices after 2003]] led to increasing fears that [[peak oil]] was imminent, further increasing interest in commercial wind power. Even though wind power generates electricity rather than liquid fuels, and thus is not an immediate substitute for petroleum in most applications (especially transport), fears over petroleum shortages only added to the urgency to expand wind power. Earlier oil crises had already caused many utility and industrial users of petroleum to shift to [[coal]] or [[natural gas]]. Wind power showed potential for replacing natural gas in electricity generation on a cost basis.

===Floating wind turbine technology===
Offshore wind power began to expand beyond fixed-bottom, shallow-water turbines beginning late in the first decade of the 2000s.  The world's first operational deep-water ''large-capacity'' [[floating wind turbine]], Hywind, became operational in the [[North Sea]] off Norway in late 2009&lt;ref name=BBC20090908&gt;

These floating turbines are a very different construction technology—closer to floating oil rigs rather—than traditional fixed-bottom, shallow-water [[monopile foundation]]s that are used in the other large [[offshore wind farm]]s to date.

By late 2011, Japan announced plans to build a multiple-unit floating wind farm, with six 2-megawatt turbines, off the [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima coast]] of northeast Japan where the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|2011 tsunami and nuclear disaster]] has created a scarcity of electric power.&lt;ref name=bb20110916&gt;

===Airborne turbines===
{{see also|High altitude wind power}}
Airborne wind energy systems use airfoils or [[Airborne wind turbine|turbines supported in the air]] by buoyancy or by aerodynamic lift. The purpose is to eliminate the expense of tower construction, and allow extraction of wind energy from steadier, faster, winds higher in the atmosphere. As yet no grid-scale plants have been constructed.  Many design concepts have been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffith|first=Saul|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/saul_griffith_on_kites_as_the_future_of_renewable_energy|title=High-altitude wind energy from kites!

==Notes==
#{{Note|a}}The terms "horizontal" and "vertical" refer to the plane of rotation of the sails. Modern wind turbines are generally referred to by the plane of rotation of the main axle (windshaft). Thus a horizontal mill may also be described as a "vertical-axis windmill" and a vertical mill may also be described as a "horizontal-axis windmill".

The '''Host Based Security System''' ('''HBSS''') is the official name given to the United States [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DOD) [[Commercial off-the-shelf|commercial-off-the-shelf]] (COTS) suite of software applications used within the DOD to monitor, detect, and defend the DOD computer networks and systems.  The [[Enterprise-wide Information Assurance and computer Network Defense Solutions Steering Group]] (ESSG) sponsored the acquisition of the HBSS System for use within the DOD Enterprise Network.  HBSS is deployed on both the [[NIPRNet|Non-Classified Internet Protocol Routed Network]] (NIPRNet) and [[SIPRNet|Secret Internet Protocol Routed Network]] (SIPRNet) networks, with priority given to installing it on the NIPRNet.  HBSS is based on [[McAfee|McAfee, Inc]]'s [[ePolicy Orchestrator]] (ePO) and other McAfee point product security applications such as [[Host Intrusion Prevention System]] (HIPS).

== History ==
Seeing the need to supply a comprehensive, department-wide security suite of tools for DOD System Administrators, the ESSG started to gather requirements for the formation of a host-based security system in the summer of 2005.  In March 2006, [[BAE Systems]] and McAfee were awarded a contract to supply an automated host-based security system to the department.  After the award, 22 pilot sites were identified to receive the first deployments of HBSS.&lt;ref&gt;''Host Based Security System'', http://www.disa.mil/hbss/index.html, 3/13/2010&lt;/ref&gt;  During the pilot roll out, DOD System Administrators around the world were identified and trained on using the HBSS software in preparation for software deployment across DOD.

On October 9, 2007, the [[Joint Task Force for Global Network Operations]] (JTF-GNO) released [[Communications Tasking Order]] (CTO) 07-12 (''Deployment of Host Based Security System (HBSS)'') mandating the deployment of HBSS on all Combatant Command, Service and Agency (CC/S/A) networks within DOD with the completion date by the 3rd quarter of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;''Host Based Security System HBSS)'',http://www.afcea.org/events/landwarnet/08/infoexchange.asp, 3/13/2010&lt;/ref&gt; The release of this CTO brought HBSS to the attention of all major department heads and CC/S/A's, providing the ESSG with the necessary authority to enforce its deployment.  Agencies not willing to comply with the CTO now risked being disconnected from the DOD [[Global Information Grid]] (GIG) for any lack of compliance.

Lessons learned from the pilot deployments provided valuable insight to the HBSS program, eventually leading to the [[Defense Information Systems Agency]] (DISA) supplying both pre-loaded HBSS hardware as well as providing an HBSS software image that could be loaded on compliant hardware platforms.  This proved to be invaluable to easing the deployment task on the newly trained HBSS System Administrators and provided a consistent department-wide software baseline.  DISA further provided step-by-step documentation for completing an HBSS baseline creation from a freshly installed operating system.  The lessons learned from the NIPRNet deployments simplified the process of deploying HBSS on the SIPRNet.

== HBSS components ==
Throughout its lifetime, HBSS has undergone several major baseline updates as well as minor maintenance releases.  The first major release of HBSS was known as Baseline 1.0 and contained the McAfee ePolicy orchestrator engine, HIPS, [[software compliance profiler]] (SCP), [[rogue system detection]] (RSD), [[asset baseline manager]] (ABM), and assets software.  As new releases were introduced, these software products have evolved, had new products added, and in some cases, been completely replaced for different products.

As of January, 2011, HBSS is currently at Baseline 4.5, Maintenance Release 2.0 (MR2). MR2 contains the following software:

== How HBSS works ==
The heart of the HBSS is the McAfee ePolicy orchestrator (ePO) management engine.  The engine is responsible for:
* Providing a consistent front-end to the point products
* Consolidating point product data for analysis
* Presenting point product reports
* Managing the point product updates and communications
* Ensure application patch compliance

&lt;!----==== Security compliance profiler ====
The security compliance profiler (SCP) was one of the original products provided in HBSS Baseline 1.0.  It was removed from HBSS as of Baseline 2.0 and replaced with the policy auditor component.  The SCP is an integral component of ePO that provides enterprise-wide reporting on security patches, including the Microsoft® operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;'''System Compliance Profiler''',http://www.mcafee.com/us/enterprise/products/promos/system_security_management/epolicy_orchestrator/compliance_profiler.html, 3/14/2010&lt;/ref&gt;
----&gt;

=== McAfee point products ===
McAfee considers a  point product to be the individual software applications controlled by  the ePO server.  The HBSS point products consist of the following:
* Host  intrusion prevention system (HIPS)
* Policy auditor (PA)
* Assets  baseline module (ABM)
* Rogue system detection (RSD)
* Device  control module (DCM)
* Asset publishing service (APS)

==== Host intrusion prevention system ====
The host intrusion prevention  system (HIPS) consists of a host-based firewall and application-level blocking consolidated in a single product.  The HIPS component is one of the most  significant components of the HBSS, as it provides for the capability  to block known intrusion signatures and restrict unauthorized services  and applications running on the host machines.

==== Policy auditor ====
Policy auditor (PA) was  introduced in HBSS Baseline 2.0.  Policy auditor is responsible for ensuring compliance with mandates such as: [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI DSS), [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002]] (SOX), [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] of 1999 (GLBA), [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996]] (HIPAA), [[Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002]] (FISMA), as well as the best practice frameworks [[ISO 27001:2005]] and Control Objectives for Information and related technology ([[COBIT]]).  PA maps IT controls against predefined policy content, McAfee Policy Auditor helps report consistently and accurately against key industry mandates and internal policies across your infrastructure or on specific targeted systems. Policy Auditor is an agent-based IT audit solution that leverages the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) to automate the processes required for internal and external IT audits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McAfee Policy Auditor|url=http://www.mcafee.com/us/products/policy-auditor.aspx|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Assets baseline module ====
The assets  baseline module, released in Baseline 1.0 as a [[government off-the-shelf]] (GOTS) product, is used to  address system baseline configurations and changes in order to respond  to [[INFOCON|information operations condition (INFOCON)]] (INFOCON) changes necessary during times of  heightened security threats to the system.  During the initial  deployment stages of HBSS, the assets module was juvenile and lacked  much of the products intended capabilities.  However, the application  has fully evolved into a robust and feature packed version capable of  handling the original software's design goals.  ABM was originally known  as Assets 1.0.  It was upgraded to Assets 2.0 in HBSS Baseline 2.0.   Later it was called Assets 3000 in HBSS Baseline 3.0.

==== Rogue system detection ====
The rogue system  detector (RSD) component of HBSS is used to provide real-time detection  of new hosts attaching to the network.  RSD monitors network segments  and reports all hosts seen on the network to the ePO Server.  The ePO  Server then determines whether the system is connected to the ePO server, has a McAfee agent installed, has been identified as an  exception, or is considered rogue.  The ePO server can then take the  appropriate action(s) concerning the rogue host, as specified in the RSD  policy.  HBSS Baseline 1.0 introduced RSD 1.0.  RSD was updated to 2.0  in HBSS Baseline 2.0.

==== Device control module/data loss prevention ====
The DCM component of HBSS was  introduced in HBSS Baseline 2.0 specifically to address the use of USB  devices on DOD networks.  JTF-GNO CTO 09-xxx, ''removable flash media device implementation within and between Department of Defense (DOD) networks'' was released in March, 2009 and  allowed the use of USB removable media, provided it meets all of the conditions stated within the CTO.  One of these conditions requires the use of HBSS with the DCM module installed and configured to manage the USB devices attached to the system.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Conway, ''DOD Can Safely Use USB'',http://blogs.mcafee.com/enterprise/public-sector/dod-can-use-usb-securely, (security insights blog), 3/9/2010&lt;/ref&gt; The DCM was renamed to the data loss prevention (DLP) in HBSS Baseline 3.0 MR3.

==== Assets publishing service ====
The assets publishing service (APS) of HBSS was introduced in HBSS Baseline 4.0 to allow for enclaves to report on asset information to a third-party DoD entity in a standards-compliant format.  It adds contextual information to HBSS assets and allows for improved reporting features on systems relying on HBSS data.

== Obtaining HBSS ==
According to JTF-GNO CTO 07-12, all DOD agencies are required to deploy HBSS to their networks.  DISA has made HBSS software available for download on their [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]] protected [https://patches.csd.disa.mil/ patch server].  Users attempting to download the software are required to have a [[common access card]] (CAC) and be on a .mil network.  DISA provides software and updates free of charge to DOD entities.

Additionally, HBSS administrators require the satisfactory completion of HBSS training and are commonly appointed by the unit or section commander in writing.

== Learning HBSS ==
In order to receive and administer an HBSS system, system administrators must satisfactorily complete online or in class HBSS training as well as be identified as an HBSS administrator.  Online training takes 30 hours to complete while in class training requires four days, excluding travel.  An advanced HBSS class is also available to HBSS administrators wishing to acquire a more in-depth knowledge of the system.  HBSS online and in class training is managed by DISA and information pertaining to these training classes can be obtained at the DISA [http://iase.disa.mil Information Assurance Support Environment] (IASE) website.

== HBSS support ==
The DISA Risk Management Executive Office (RE) formerly [[field security office]] (FSO) provides free technical support for all HBSS Administrators through their help desk.  DISA has three tiers of support, from Tier I to Tier III.  Tier I and Tier II support is provided by DISA FSO, while Tier III support is provided by McAfee.  DISA FSO Support is available using one of the following methods:&lt;ref&gt;''IA Tools'', http://iase.disa.mil/tools/index.html, 3/14/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== The future of HBSS ==
At its current pace, HBSS has been updated several times from the original Baseline 1.0 to the current Baseline 3.0, MR3 version.  Within Baseline 3.0, maintenance releases have been introduced every two to four months, bringing better stability and security with each release.  HBSS follows McAfee ePO version updates closely and it is expected to continue this trend as ePO is continuously developed.

The '''Institution of Mining Engineers''' (IMinE) was a former British professional institution.

==History==
It began as the Federated Institution of Mining Engineers in 1889, comprising the Chesterfield and Midland Counties Institution of Engineers; Midland Institute of Mining, Civil and Mechanical Engineers; [[North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers]]; South Staffordshire and East Worcestershire Institute of Mining Engineers and later the North Staffordshire Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers, the Mining Institute of Scotland and the Manchester Geological and Mining Society. It was given a Royal Charter in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/RC000268 Companies House]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s it became affiliated with Group Four of the [[Engineering Council]]; there were fifty-one affiliated engineering organisations to the Engineering Council. 

===Mergers===
It merged with the [[National Association of Colliery Managers]], effective from 23 October 1968. In 1995 it merged with the [[Institution of Mining Electrical and Mining Mechanical Engineers]]. Soon after discussions about a merger with the [[Institution of Mining and Metallurgy]], founded in 1892, took place, which it merged with in 2002.

'''Macroinvertebrate Community Index''' (MCI) is an [[Index (statistics)|index]] used in [[New Zealand]] to measure the [[water quality]] of fresh water streams.&lt;ref name="LAWADefn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Macroinvertebrate Community Index|url=https://www.lawa.org.nz/learn/glossary/m/macroinvertebrate-community-index-(mci)|website=www.lawa.org.nz|publisher=Land Air Water Aoteraroa|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence or lack of [[invertebrate|macroinvertebrates]] such as insects, worms and snails in a river or stream can give a [[Bioindicator|biological indicator]] on the health of that waterway.&lt;ref name="MFEMCI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Macroinvertebrate Community Composition (MCI)|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/more/environmental-reporting/reporting-act/fresh-water/river-condition-indicator/macroinvertebrates|website=Ministry for the Environment|publisher=Government of New Zealand|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCI assigns a number to each [[species]] of macroinvertebrate based on the sensitivity of that species to [[pollution]]. The index then calculates an average score.&lt;ref name="LAWADefn"/&gt; A higher score on the MCI generally indicates a more healthy stream.&lt;ref name="MFEMCI"/&gt;

The '''MCI (Macro invertebrate Community Index)''' relies on an allocation of scores to freshwater macroinvertebrates based on their pollution tolerances. Freshwater macroinvertebrates found in pristine conditions would score higher than those found in polluted areas.&lt;ref name="STARK 1993"&gt;Stark, J. D. (1993) Performance of the Macroinvertebrate Community Index: Effects of sampling method, sample replication, water depth, current velocity, and substratum on index values. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research 27:4, 463-478.&lt;/ref&gt; MCI values can be calculated using macroinvertebrate presence-absence data using this equation:&lt;ref name="STARK 1993"/&gt;

'''MCI = [(site score)/(# of scoring taxa)]*20'''

Previous [[water quality]] assessments have relied on both chemical and habitat analysis, however, these methods have been proven to be insufficient due to pollution from nonpoint sources.&lt;ref name="BENNETT"&gt;Bennett, H. H., M. W. Mullen, P. M. Stewart, J. A. Sawyer, and E. C. W. (2004) Development of an Invertebrate Community Index for an Alabama Coastal Plain Watershed. Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 40:1, 43-51&lt;/ref&gt; Species living in an aquatic environment may be the best natural indicator of environmental quality and reveal the effects of any habitat alteration or pollution,&lt;ref name="BENNETT"/&gt; and have proved to respond to a wide range of stressors such as [[sedimentation]], [[urbanization]], [[agricultural]] practices and forest harvesting effects.&lt;ref name="COLLIER"&gt;Collier, KJ. (2014) Wood decay rates and macroinvertebrate community structure along contrasting human pressure gradients (Waikato, New Zealand), New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 48:1, 97-111&lt;/ref&gt; Any changes that may occur in macroinvertebrate communities that lead to a reduction in diversity increase the dominance of pollution-tolerant invertebrates, such as [[oligochaetes]] and [[chironomids]].&lt;ref name="HALL"&gt;Hall, M. J., G. P. Closs and R. H. Riley. (2001) Relationships between land use and stream invertebrate community structure in a South Island, New Zealand, coastal stream catchment. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 35:3, 591-603&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a lack of species diversity and low [[biotic index]] scores of inhabitant macroinvertebrates may be an indicator of poor water quality.&lt;ref name="COLLINS"&gt;Collins, C. L., M. W. Mullen, P. M. Stewart, and E. C. Webber. (2008) Validation of an Invertebrate Community Index for Urban Streams for an Alabama Coastal Plains Watershed. Journal of The American Water Resources Association, 44(3), 663-669&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of water quality degradation is the greatest in low-elevation areas, where high intensity agriculture and urban development are the dominant land uses.&lt;ref name="LARNED"&gt;Larned, S. T., T. Snelder, M. J. Unwin, and G.B. McBride. (2016) Water quality in New Zealand rivers: current state and trends. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 50:3, 389-417&lt;/ref&gt;

Macro invertebrate communities are the preferred indicators of aquatic ecosystem health because they are very easy to both collect and identify, and have short life spans, thus responding very quickly to changes in their environment.&lt;ref name="COLLIER"/&gt; The MCI methods of utilizing macroinvertebrate communities to assess the overall health of an aquatic environment continues to be the most reliable, applicable, and widely acclaimed method around the world.&lt;ref name="OLOMUKORO"&gt;Olomukoro, J. O. and A. Dirisu. (2014) Macroinvertebrate Community and Pollution Tolerance Index in Edion and Omodo Rivers in Derived Savannah Wetlands in Southern Nigeria. Jordan Journal of Biological Sciences, 7:1, 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Variations on the MCI'''

In addition to the MCI indexed defined above, there are also two other variations of the MCI. The QMCI (Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index) and the SQMCI (Semi-Quantitative Macroinvertebrate Community Index). Both MCI and QMCI are widely used in countries like New Zealand. The combination of widespread use and good performance of the MCI and the QMCI in detecting water quality in aquatic ecosystems has sparked interest in further refinement of the methods in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="STARK 1998"&gt;Stark, J. D. (1998) SQMCI: A biotic index for freshwater macroinvertebrate coded‐abundance data. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 32:1, 55-66.&lt;/ref&gt; The QMCI, just like the MCI, was initially designed to evaluate the organic enrichment in aquatic ecosystems. The third index, the SQMCI, was created to reduce sampling and processing efforts required for the QMCI.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"&gt;Wright‐Stow, A. E. and Winterbourn, M. J. (2003) How well do New Zealand's stream‐monitoring indicators, the macroinvertebrate community index and its quantitative variant, correspond? New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 37:2, 461-470.&lt;/ref&gt; The SQMCI will respond in a similar matter to the QMCI in community dominance, however, will require fewer samples to achieve the same precision. The SQMCI gives a comparative appraisal to the QMCI with under 40% of the [[exertion]], in circumstances that macroinvertebrate densities are not required. This diminishes expenses and also enhances the logical solidness of biomonitoring projects.&lt;ref name="STARK 1998"/&gt; Both the QMCI and SQMCI are similar to the MCI in the way that they are graded on a 1 (extremely tolerant) to 10 (highly intolerant) scale. However, they differ in the way that MCI is calculated using presence-absence data whereas QMCI uses quantitative or percentage data.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"/&gt; Having a qualitative, quantitative, and semi-quantitative version of the same index has raised some questions as to if this is a good thing or not. All three indexes have the same purpose, which is to measure the quality of an aquatic ecosystem, however, there are no clear recommendations about when each one is most appropriate to be used. In a study conducted on 88 rivers, Searsbrook et al. (2000) concluded MCI is more useful than the QMCI for recognizing changes in stream water quality over time. Having three forms of a similar index may prompt to various conclusions and also opens the route for specific utilization of either file to give bias to a specific position or position taken by a specialist.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"/&gt; Consistency on the different versions of MCI have not yet been formally measured despite the communication that has been made to the public, managers and politicians.&lt;ref name="WRIGHT-STOW"/&gt;
	

'''QMCI values can be calculated using:
QMCI = ∑_(i=1)^(i=s)▒(n_i*a_i)/N'''

SQMCI values can be calculated similar to QMCI except that coded abundances are substituted for actual counts. Example:

'''SQMCI = ∑_(i=1)^(i=s)▒(n_i*a_i)/N'''

'''Factors Influencing MCI'''
There are several factors which can affect the data acquisition of MCI when assessing the water quality of an aquatic ecosystem. Hard-bottom and Soft-bottom channels can often yield different results and many researchers will use two different versions of the MCI. For example, in a study by Stark &amp; Mallard (2007) they discuss that hard and soft bottom channels have separate versions of the MCI and the two versions can not be combined into one data set because of the differences in [[taxa]] and tolerance values.&lt;ref name="LARNED"/&gt;
	

[[Spatial variability]] is also of interest in terms of affecting the data acquired through MCI. Sites which are progressively down stream often tend to yield a lower MCI value. There may also be confounding influences between riffles, runs, or pools with a single stream reach.&lt;ref name="STARK 2009"&gt;Stark, J. D. and N. Phillips. (2009) Seasonal variability in the Macroinvertebrate Community Index: Are seasonal correction factors required? New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 43:4, 867-882&lt;/ref&gt;
	

Depth and velocity have also been raised as a concern with regards to effecting results, however Stark (1993) investigated the influences of the sampling method, water depth, current velocity and [[substratum]] on the results and found that both MCI and QMCI are independent of depth, velocity, and substratum from macroinvertebrate samples collected from stony riffles.&lt;ref name="STARK 1998"/&gt; This finding is an advantage for the assessment of water pollution.
	

There have been several studies conducted on seasonal variability, which has been considered the main influential factor on the assessment of water quality. It has been concluded that all models should test data that has been collected in the season as the reference data, which is being used.&lt;ref name="STARK 2009"/&gt;
	

There have been several other factors such as water temperature, invertebrate life histories and dissolved oxygen levels that have all been explained as causes of seasonal variability. Warmer seasons have biotic indices that are indicative of poorer stream health.&lt;ref name="STARK 2009"/&gt; Warmer seasons such as summer, would have increased temperatures therefore increasing water temperature and decreasing the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water making the environment less ideal to aquatic macroinvertebrates. In return, this effects the density of macroinvertebrate population and changes the results of the indices.

'''Mana''', in [[Austronesian languages]], means "power", "effectiveness", and "prestige". In most cases, this power and its source are understood to be supernatural and inexplicable.&lt;ref name=POLLEX&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pollex.org.nz/entry/mana1/ |title=Entries for MANA.1 [OC&amp;#93; Power, effectiveness, prestige |publisher=Pollex.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its semantics are language-dependent. The concept is significant in [[Polynesia]]n culture and is part of contemporary [[Pacific Islander]] culture; it came to the attention of Western anthropologists through reports from island missionaries. Its study was included in [[cultural anthropology]]—specifically, the anthropology of religion. Links were seen between ''mana'' and earlier phases of Western religion: [[animism]] at first, followed by [[Robert Ranulph Marett|pre-animism]].

==Etymology==
According to the POLLEX Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenhill|first1=Simon J.|last2=Clark|first2=Ross|date=2011|title=POLLEX-Online: The Polynesian Lexicon Project Online|url=http://simon.net.nz/files//2012/12/Greenhill_and_Clark2011.pdf|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|volume=50|issue=2|pages=551–559|doi=10.1353/ol.2011.0014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a protoform (an ancestral form of a word) for "mana"—noted in historical-linguistic convention as *mana-"—existed in [[Proto-Oceanic language|Proto-Oceanic]], the precursor of many Pacific languages. Although the path through the tree from Proto-Oceanic to a specific language is not always clear, the word and concept are thousands of years old. According to linguist Robert Blust, "mana" means "thunder, storm, or wind" in some languages. Blust hypothesized that the term originally meant "powerful forces of nature such as thunder and storm winds that were conceived as the expression of an unseen supernatural agency. As Oceanic-speaking peoples spread eastward, the notion of an unseen supernatural agency became detached from the physical forces of nature that had inspired it and assumed a life of its own."&lt;ref name="Blust"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blust|first1=R. A|title=Proto-Oceanic *mana Revisited|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|date=2007|volume=46|issue=2|pages=404–423|doi=10.1353/ol.2008.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|In Polynesian culture}}Polynesian culture==
Mana is a foundation of the [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian worldview]], a spiritual quality with a supernatural origin and a sacred, impersonal force. To have ''mana'' implies influence, [[authority]], and efficacy—the ability to perform in a given situation. The quality of ''mana'' is not limited to individuals; peoples, governments, places and inanimate objects may also possess ''mana'', and its possessors are accorded respect.

==={{anchor|In Hawaiian and Tahitian culture}}Hawaiian and Tahitian culture===
In Hawaiian and Tahitian culture, mana is a [[Energy (esotericism)|spiritual energy]] and healing power which can exist in places, objects and persons. Hawaiians believe that mana may be gained or lost by actions, and Hawaiians and Tahitians believe that mana is both external and internal. Sites on the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and in [[French Polynesia]] are believed to possess mana—for example, the top rim of the [[Haleakalā]] volcano on the island of [[Maui]] and the [[Taputapuatea marae]] on the island of [[Raiatea]] in the [[Society Islands]].

Ancient Hawaiian believed that the island of [[Molokaʻi]] possesses mana, compared with its neighboring islands. Before the unification of Hawaii by [[Kamehameha I|King Kamehameha I]], battles were fought for possession of the island and its south-shore fish ponds which existed until the late 19th century.

A person may gain mana by ''[[pono]]'' (right actions). In ancient Hawaii, there were two paths to mana: sexual means or violence. Nature is dualistic, and everything has a counterpart. A balance between the gods [[Kū]] and [[Lono]] formed, through whom are the two paths to mana (''ʻimihaku'', or the search for mana). Kū, the god of war and politics, offers mana through violence; this was how Kamehameha gained his mana. Lono, the god of peace and fertility, offers mana through sexuality.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In [[Māori language|Māori]], a tribe with ''mana whenua'' must have demonstrated their authority over a territory.

According to the New Zealand Ministry of Justice:

{{quote|Mana and tapu are concepts which have both been attributed single-worded definitions by contemporary writers. As concepts, especially Maori concepts they can not easily be translated into a single English definition.

In contemporary [[New Zealand English]], the word "mana", taken from the Māori, refers to a person or organisation of people of great personal prestige and character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newzealandatoz.com/index.php?pageid=357 |title=Kiwi (NZ) to English Dictionary |publisher=New Zealand A to Z |date= |accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased use of the term mana in New Zealand society is as a result of the [[politicisation]] of Maori issues stemming from the [[Māori Renaissance]]. 

=={{anchor|In fantasy}}Gaming and literature==
{{main article|Magic (gaming)}}

[[Larry Niven]] adopted the term in his 1969 short story, [[All the Myriad Ways|"Not Long Before the End"]].  In this and subsequent stories, "mana" was the magical fuel used to cast spells. It was a non-renewable environmental resource; heavy use of magic could deplete the mana in an area.

Following on from the idea of mana as something that could be "used up", fantasy [[role-playing game]]s and video games adopted the term to quantify "magical power."&lt;ref name="Golub"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Golub |first1=Alex |title=The History of Mana: How an Austronesian Concept Became a Video Game Mechanic |url=http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/4/the-history-of-mana-how-an-austronesian-concept-became-a-video-game-mechanic |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620052259/http://theappendix.net/issues/2014/4/the-history-of-mana-how-an-austronesian-concept-became-a-video-game-mechanic|dead-url=no |archive-date=20 June 2014 |website=theappendix.net |publisher=The Appendix |accessdate=4 September 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Magic points (MPs) were used by ''[[Ultima III: Exodus]]'' and games influenced by it, and for example the 1987 video game ''[[Dungeon Master (video game)|Dungeon Master]]'' replaced "magic points" with "mana points" as the definition of MPs.

Mana was used in a number of early role-playing [[board game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomlinson|first1=Matt|last2=P.

Missionary [[Robert Henry Codrington]] traveled widely in [[Melanesia]], publishing several studies of its language and culture. His 1891 book ''The Melanesians: Studies in their Anthropology and Folk-Lore'' contains the first detailed description of mana. Codrington defines it as "a force altogether distinct from physical power, which acts in all kinds of ways for good and evil, and which it is of the greatest advantage to possess or control".&lt;ref name="Codrington"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Codrington|first1=Robert Henry|title=The Melanesians: Studies in Their Anthropology and Folk-lore|date=1891|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=New York|isbn=9780486202587|page=118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xiMHAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Melanesians:+Studies+in+Their+Anthropology+and+Folklore.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TxDYVJHlGIHZggSm0YL4BA&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His era had already defined [[animism]], the concept that the energy (or life) in an object derives from a spiritual component. [[Georg Ernst Stahl]]'s 18th-century animism was adopted by [[Edward Burnett Tylor]], the founder of [[cultural anthropology]], who presented his initial ideas about the history of religion in his 1865 ''Researches into the Early History of Mankind''&lt;ref name="Tylor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tylor|first1=Edward B.|title=Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=1108017517}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|vi}} and developed them in volumes one (1871) and two (1874) of ''Primitive Culture''.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

===Tylor's cultural evolution===
In Tylor's [[cultural anthropology]], other [[primate]]s (from which evolutionists hypothesized man had evolved) did not appear to possess culture.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The discovery that primates and other mammals [[animal culture|have some culture]] (practical knowledge taught by parents who learned it from their parents) does not substantially affect the argument, since humanity's characteristically-complex learned behaviour is unique.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tylor did not try to find evidence of a non-cultural human state because he considered it unreachable, "a condition not far removed from that of the lower animals" and "savage life as in some sort representing an early known state."&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|33}} He described such a hypothetical state as "the human savage naked in both mind and body, and destitute of laws, or arts, or ideas, and almost of language".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|30}} According to Tylor, speculation about an acultural state is impossible. Using the method of [[Comparative cultural studies|comparative culture]], similar to [[comparative anatomy]] and the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method of historical linguistics]] and following [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], he drew up a dual classification of cultural traits ([[meme]]s and [[memeplex]]es): savage and civilised. Tylor wrote, "From an ideal point of view, civilization may be looked upon as the general improvement of mankind by higher organization of the individual and of society ... "&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|24}} and identified his model with the "progression-theory of civilization".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|81}}

===Evolution of religion===
Tylor cited a "minimum definition" of religion as "the belief in Spiritual Beings".&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|383}} Noting that no savage societies lack religion and that the initial state of a religious man is beyond reach, he enumerated two stages in the evolution of religion: a simple belief in individual animae (or Doctrine of Souls) and the elaboration of dogmas. The dogmas are systems of higher spirits commanding phases of nature. In volume two of ''Primitive Culture'', Tylor called this stage the Doctrine of Spirits.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|108–110}} He used the word "animism" in two different senses.&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|385}} The first is religion itself: a belief in the spiritual as an effective energy, shared by every specific religion. In his progression theory, an undogmatic version preceded rational theological systems. Animism is the simple Theory of the Soul, which [[comparative religion]] attempts to reconstruct.

Tylor's work predated Codrington's, and he was unfamiliar with the latter. The concept of mana occasioned a revision of Tylor's view of the evolution of religion. The first anthropologist to formulate a revision (which he called "pre-animistic religion") was [[Robert Ranulph Marett]], in a series of papers collected and published as ''Threshold of Religion''. In its preface he takes credit for the adjective "pre-animistic" but not the noun "pre-animism", although he does not attribute it.&lt;ref name="Marett"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marett|first1=Robert Randolph|title=Threshold of Religion|date=2013|publisher=Hardpress Ltd|location=|isbn=1313151963}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxi}}

According to Marett, "Animism will not suffice as a minimum definition of religion." Tylor had used the term "natural religion",&lt;ref name="Tylor"/&gt;{{rp|386}} consistent with Georg Ernst Stahl's concept of a natural spiritual energy. The soul of an animal, for example, is its vital principle. Marett wrote, "One must dig deeper" to find the "roots of religion".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==={{anchor|Pre-animistic phase of religion}}Pre-animism===
Describing pre-animism, Marett cited the Melanesian mana (primarily with Codrington's work): "When the science of Comparative Religion employs a native expression such as mana ... it is obliged to disregard to some extent its original or local meaning ... Science, then, may adopt mana as a general category ... ".&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|99}} In Melanesia the ''animae'' are the souls of living men, the ghosts of deceased men, and spirits "of ghost-like appearance" or imitating living people. Spirits can inhabit other objects, such as animals or stones.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|115–120}}

The most significant property of mana is that it is distinct from, and exists independently of, its source. ''Animae'' act only through mana. It is impersonal, undistinguished, and (like energy) transmissible between objects, which can have more or less of it. Mana is perceptible, appearing as a "Power of awfulness" (in the sense of awe or wonder).&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|12–13}} Objects possessing it impress an observer with "respect, veneration, propitiation, service" emanating from the mana's power. Marett lists a number of objects habitually possessing mana: "startling manifestations of nature", "curious stones", animals, "human remains", blood,&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|2}} thunderstorms, eclipses, eruptions, glaciers, and the sound of a [[bullroarer]].&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|14–17}}

If mana is a distinct power, it may be treated distinctly. Marett distinguishes [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]s, which treat mana quasi-objectively, and prayers (which address the ''anima''). An ''anima'' may have departed, leaving mana in the form of a spell which can be addressed by [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Although Marett postulates an earlier pre-animistic phase, a "rudimentary religion" or "magico-religious" phase in which the mana figures without ''animae'', "no island of pure 'pre-animism' is to be found."&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|xxvi}} Like Tylor, he theorizes a thread of commonality between animism and pre-animism identified with the [[supernatural]]—the "mysterious", as opposed to the reasonable.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|22}}

==={{anchor|Criticisms}}Criticism===
In 1936, [[Ian Hogbin]] criticised the universality of Marett's pre-animism: "Mana is by no means universal and, consequently, to adopt it as a basis on which to build up a general theory of primitive religion is not only erroneous but indeed fallacious".&lt;ref name="Mana"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogbin|first1=H. Ian|title=MANA|journal=Oceania|date=March 1936|volume=6|issue=3|pages=241–274|doi=10.1002/j.1834-4461.1936.tb00187.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Marett intended the concept as an abstraction.&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|99}} Spells, for example, may be found "from Central Australia to Scotland."&lt;ref name="Marett"/&gt;{{rp|55}}

Early 20th-century scholars also saw mana as a universal concept, found in all human cultures and expressing fundamental human awareness of a sacred life energy. In his 1904 essay, "Outline of a General Theory of Magic", [[Marcel Mauss]] drew on the writings of Codrington and others to paint a picture of mana as "power ''par excellence'', the genuine effectiveness of things which corroborates their practical actions without annihilating them".&lt;ref name="Mauss"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mauss|first1=Marcel|title=A General Theory of Magic|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415253963|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}} Mauss pointed out the similarity of mana to the [[Iroquois]] [[orenda]] and the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] [[manitou]], convinced of the "universality of the institution";&lt;ref name="Mauss"/&gt;{{rp|116}} "a concept, encompassing the idea of magical power, was once found everywhere".&lt;ref name="Mauss"/&gt;{{rp|117}}

Mauss and his collaborator, [[Henri Hubert]], were criticised for this position when their 1904 ''Outline of a General Theory of Magic'' was published. "No one questioned the existence of the notion of mana", wrote Mauss's biographer [[Marcel Fournier]], "but Hubert and Mauss were criticized for giving it a universal dimension".&lt;ref name="Fournier"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fournier|first1=Marcel|title=Marcel Mauss: A Biography|date=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=9780691117775|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of mana as an archetype of life energy increased. According to [[Mircea Eliade]], the idea of mana is not universal; in places where it is believed, not everyone has it, and "even among the varying formulae (''mana'', ''wakan'', ''orenda'', etc.) there are, if not glaring differences, certainly nuances not sufficiently observed in the early studies".&lt;ref name="Eliade"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Patterns in Comparative Religion|date=1996|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=9780803267336|page=22|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; "With regard to these theories founded upon the primordial and universal character of mana, we must say without delay that they have been invalidated by later research".&lt;ref name="Eliade2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eliade|first1=Mircea|title=Myths, Dreams and Mysteries: The Encounter Between Contemporary Faiths and Archaic Realities|date=1992|publisher=Peter Smith|location=Magnolia, Massachusetts|isbn=9780844666259|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts of this grid are blocked by components, specialised areas, or already present wiring. The grid size corresponds to the wiring pitch of the area. The goal is to find a chain of grid cells that go from point A to point B.

A maze runner may use the [[Lee algorithm]]. It uses a [[wave propagation]] style (a wave are all cells that can be reached in n steps) throughout the routing space. The wave stops when the target is reached, and the path is determined by backtracking through the cells.

The '''National Aptitude Test in Architecture''' ('''NATA'''), is conducted by [[National Institute of Advanced Studies in Architecture]] ([[NIASA]]) which is a body of [[Council of Architecture]], [[New Delhi]] in [[India]]. The National Aptitude Test in Architecture &lt;ref name="nata."&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nata.in|title=Home|publisher=nata.in|accessdate=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a national level examination for admission to undergraduate courses in Architecture. The test measures the aptitude of applicants for a specific field of study, i.e. [[Architecture]], in areas like drawing and observation skills, sense of proportion, aesthetic sensitivity and critical thinking, qualities that have been acquired over a long period of time and that are related to Architecture.
NATA or the [[AIEEE]] B.Arch exam are prescribed by the Council of Architecture as a compulsory criterion for taking admission to any Architectural College or course in India.

== Scheme of Examination ==

1. National Aptitude Test in Architecture (NATA) is being conducted by the Council of Architecture at national level for admission to 5 year B.Arch Degree Course at all recognized institutions across India.&lt;br /&gt; 
2. NATA scores are used by admissions authorities of different Government, Govt. Aided &amp; Unaided schools / colleges of Architecture.&lt;br /&gt; 
3. The test measures drawing and observation skills, sense of proportion, aesthetic sensitivity and critical thinking ability.&lt;br /&gt; 
4. The test is in two parts. A paper based drawing test for two hours and computer based online aesthetic sensitivity test.

== NATA Participating Colleges in India ==
NATA is the qualifying exam for admission to Architecture courses across India. Some NATA Participating Colleges or Institutions are:&lt;ref name="careers360"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering.careers360.com/nata/participating-colleges |title=NATA Accepting Colleges |publisher=engineering.careers360.com|accessdate=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4719">'''Organismic computing''' is a form of engineered [[human computation]] that employs technology to enable "shared sensing, collective reasoning, and coordinated action"&lt;ref name="michelucci"&gt;Michelucci, P. (2013). Organismic Computing. In P. Michelucci (Ed.), Handbook of Human Computation (pp. 475–501). Springer New York. Retrieved from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-8806-4_36&lt;/ref&gt; within human groups toward goal-directed behavior.  This [[biomimetic]] approach to augmenting group efficacy seeks to improve [[synergy]] by allowing a group of individuals to function as a single intelligent [[superorganism]].

__TOC__

== Rationale ==
For many tasks, increasing the size of a group leads to diminishing returns.  That is, each new person contributes less to overall group performance.  This suggests that the [[benefit-cost ratio]] associated with adding a new person decreases as the group gets larger.  The organismic approach to augmenting group efficacy seeks to leverage the quadratic growth in the number of possible relationships among group members, as described by [[Metcalfe's law]].  By increasing the number of relationships realized and by sufficiently increasing the utility of those relationship, each new group member would add more value to the group than previous members.

== Approach ==
The organismic model of group efficacy assumes that enabling real-time distributed sensing, reasoning, and acting, using the right augmentation methods, will increase group efficacy via synergistic effects that result from more and improved connections among individuals in a group.  Indeed, organismic computing research is focused primarily on the pursuit of augmentation methods that are optimal for different applications of group behavior.  Additionally, the application space may dictate a greater emphasis on one of the following members of the "synergistic triad".

=== Shared sensing ===
Shared sensing is the notion that individual or aggregated sensory experiences are shared in real-time across members of a group, toward greater awareness of information relevant to an individual's goals.

=== Collective reasoning ===
[[Collective intelligence|Collective reasoning]] includes a broad space of methods that enable the creation and dissemination of information due to [[distributed cognition]].

=== Coordinated action ===
Coordinated action involves methods that enable effective, synchronous group behaviors.

== Challenges ==
A key challenge in developing effective organismic computing methods is the problem of [[information overload]].  Because humans are limited capacity systems, which include both attentional and processing [[bottleneck (software)|bottlenecks]], the availability or imposition of additional information may create interference that reduces goal-related performance.

== Evidence ==
A 2013 pilot study&lt;ref name="michelucci"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greene, K., &amp; Young, T. (2013). Human Stigmergy in Augmented Environments. In B. Hartman &amp; E. Horvitz (Eds.), HCOMP. AAAI. Retrieved from http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/hcomp/hcomp2013.html#GreeneY13&lt;/ref&gt; examined performance in a [[hide-and-seek]] task within a simulated [[augmented reality]] environment.  Synergistic effects seemed to increased with group size and level of augmentation.
A 2010 [[collective intelligence]] study&lt;ref name="woolley"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Woolley | first1 = A. W. | last2 = Chabris | first2 = C. F. | last3 = Pentland | first3 = A. | last4 = Hashmi | first4 = N. | last5 = Malone | first5 = T. W. | year = 2010 | title = Evidence for a Collective Intelligence Factor in the Performance of Human Groups | url = | journal = Science | volume = 330 | issue = 6004| pages = 686–688 | doi = 10.1126/science.1193147 | pmid=20929725}}&lt;/ref&gt; of group problem solving performance revealed strong evidence that "Group IQ" correlated strongly with the social intelligence of each group member and only weakly with individual IQ, suggesting that interaction dynamics among group members is a better predictor of group problem solving performance than individual problem solving abilities.

== Applications ==
Organismic computing, due to its emphasis on [[Intelligent agent|agency]], is best suited to interaction in the physical, [[virtual reality|simulated]], or [[augmented reality|augmented]] world.  Thus, potential applications include [[Emergency management|crisis relief]], [[first responders|first response]], and [[counter-terrorism]], as well as problem-solving in artificial environments by recasting abstract problems using real-world metaphors.

A '''profession''' is a occupation founded upon specialized [[educational]] [[training]], the purpose of which is to supply disinterested objective counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain.&lt;ref&gt;[[New Statesman]], 21 April 1917, article by [[Sidney Webb]] and [[Beatrice Webb]] quoted with approval at paragraph 123 of a report by the UK Competition Commission, dated 8 November 1977, entitled [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140402141250/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1976_1979/108architects.htm ''Architects Services''] (in Chapter 7).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.professions.org.au/about-us/what-is-a-professional|title=What is a Profession|publisher = Australian Council of Professions|accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a truncation of the term "liberal profession", which is, in turn, an Anglicization of the French term "profession libérale". Originally borrowed by English users in the 19th century, it has been re-borrowed by international users from the late 20th, though the (upper-middle) class overtones of the term do not seem to survive retranslation: "liberal professions" are, according to the [[European Union]]'s Directive on Recognition of Professional Qualifications (2005/36/EC) "those practiced on the basis of relevant professional qualifications in a personal, responsible and professionally independent capacity by those providing intellectual and conceptual services in the interest of the client and the public".

It has been said that a profession is not a trade&lt;ref&gt;John J Parker, "A Profession Not a Skilled Trade" (1955-1956) 8 South Carolina Law Quarterly 179 [https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/sclr8&amp;div=32&amp;id=&amp;page= HeinOnline]; Sommerlad, Harris-Short, Vaughan and Young (eds), The Futures of Legal Education and the Legal Profession, Bloomsbury, 2015, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yUq9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p 147]; Richard Colman, [https://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/10/28/medicine-profession-not-trade "Medicine is a profession not a trade"], British Medical Journal, 7 October 2001; A M Linz, "A profession, not a trade" (December 1990) New York State Dental Journal 56(10):16 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/2080056/ PubMed]; E.

Eberle, "The practice of medicine held to be a profession and not a trade" (August 1939) 28 Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association 482 [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jps.3080280802 Wiley]; Wendler, Tremml and Buecker (eds), Key Aspects of German Business Law: A Practical Manual, 2nd Ed, Springer, 2002, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Nj6bBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p 255]; William F Ryan, "Methods of Achieving Professional Recognition" (1946) The American Engineer, vols 16-17, p 8 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MdEmAAAAMAAJ] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=v7gpAQAAMAAJ].&lt;/ref&gt; and not an industry.&lt;ref&gt;(1961) [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xHchAQAAIAAJ 2] The Industrial and Labour Law Digest, 1926-1959, Annotated 668; Sharma and Goyal, Hospital Administration And Human Resource Management, 5th Ed, PHI Learning, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HFzTry0ll9kC&amp;pg=PA445#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p 445].&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Jesus and the doctors of the Faith dsc01783.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|&lt;div class="center"&gt;''Jesus and the doctors of the Faith'', &lt;br /&gt; by the entourage of [[Giuseppe Ribera]]&lt;/div&gt;]]

&lt;ref name="perks-p2"/&gt; – the so-called "learned professions".&lt;ref&gt;See for example:

&lt;/ref&gt;

Major milestones which may mark an occupation being identified as a profession include:&lt;ref name="perks-p2"&gt;Perks, R.W.(1993): ''Accounting and Society''. Chapman &amp; Hall (London); {{ISBN|0-412-47330-5}}. p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

# an occupation becomes a full-time occupation
# the establishment of a [[educational institution|training school]]
# the establishment of a [[university]] school
# the establishment of a local [[Voluntary association|association]]
# the establishment of a national association of [[professional ethics]]
# the establishment of state [[Licensure|licensing]] laws

Applying these milestones to the historical sequence of development in the United States shows [[surveying]] achieving professional status first (note that George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln all worked as land surveyors before entering politics{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}), followed by medicine,  [[actuarial science]], law, [[dentistry]], [[civil engineering]], [[logistics]], [[architecture]] and [[accounting]].&lt;ref&gt;Perks, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of technology and occupational specialization in the 19th century, other bodies began to claim professional status: [[mechanical engineering]], [[pharmacy]], [[veterinary medicine]], [[psychology]], [[nursing]], [[teaching]], [[librarianship]], [[optometry]] and [[social work]], each of which could claim, using these milestones, to have become professions by 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, J.W. &amp; Buckley, M.H. (1974): ''The Accounting Profession''. Melville, Los Angeles. Quoted by Perks, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as some professions rise in status and power through various stages, others may decline.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Disciplines formalized more recently, such as architecture, now have equally long periods of study associated with them.&lt;ref&gt;''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although professions may enjoy relatively high status and public prestige, not all professionals earn high salaries, and even within specific professions there exist significant inequalities of compensation; in law, for example, a corporate/insurance [[defense lawyer]] working on a billable-hour basis may earn several times what a [[District attorney|prosecutor]] or [[public defender]] earns.

==Formation==
A profession arises when any trade or occupation transforms itself through ''"the development of formal qualifications based upon education, apprenticeship, and examinations, the emergence of regulatory bodies with powers to admit and discipline members, and some degree of [[monopoly]] rights."''&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bullock &amp; Stephen Trombley, ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought,'' London: Harper-Collins, 1999, p.689.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
{{Main article|Professional body}}
Originally, any regulation of the professions was [[Self-regulatory organization|self-regulation]] through bodies such as the [[College of Physicians]] or the [[Inns of Court]]. With the growing role of government, statutory bodies have increasingly taken on this role, their members being appointed either by the profession or (increasingly) by government. Proposals for the introduction or enhancement of statutory regulation may be welcomed by a profession as protecting clients and enhancing its quality and reputation, or as restricting access to the profession and hence enabling higher fees to be charged. It may be resisted as limiting the members' freedom to innovate or to practice as in their professional judgement they consider best.

An example was in 12, when the British government proposed wide statutory regulation of psychologists. The inspiration for the change was a number of problems in the [[psychotherapy]] field, but there are various kinds of psychologist including many who have no clinical role and where the case for regulation was not so clear. [[Industrial and organizational psychology|Work psychology]] brought especial disagreement, with the [[British Psychological Society]] favoring statutory regulation of "occupational psychologists" and the [[Association of Business Psychologists]] resisting the statutory regulation of "business psychologists" – descriptions of professional activity which it may not be easy to distinguish.

Besides regulating access to a profession, professional bodies may set [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s of competence and enforce adherence to an [[ethical code]].  There may be several such bodies for one profession in a single country, an example being the [[British qualified accountants|accountancy bodies]] of the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]], [[Chartered Accountants Ireland|CAI]], [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants|CIMA]], [[Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy|CIPFA]], [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales|ICAEW]] and [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland|ICAS]]), all of which have been given a [[Royal Charter]], although their members are not necessarily considered to hold equivalent qualifications, and which operate alongside further bodies ([[Association of Authorised Public Accountants|AAPA]], [[Institute of Financial Accountants|IFA]], [[Certified Public Accountants Association|CPAA]]). Another example of a regulatory body that governs a profession is the Hong Kong Professional Teachers Union, which governs the conduct, rights, obligations and duties of salaried teachers working in educational institutions in Hong Kong.

The [[engineering]] profession is highly regulated in some countries (Canada and USA) with a strict licensing system for [[Professional Engineer]] that controls the practice but not in others (UK) where titles and qualifications are regulated [[Chartered Engineer]] but practice is not regulated. 

Typically, individuals are required by law to be qualified by a local professional body before they are permitted to practice in that profession. However, in some countries, individuals may not be required by law to be qualified by such a professional body in order to practice, as is the case for accountancy in the [[United Kingdom]] (except for auditing and insolvency work which legally require qualification by a professional body). In such cases, qualification by the professional bodies is effectively still considered a prerequisite to practice as most employers and clients stipulate that the individual hold such qualifications before hiring their services. For example, in order to become a fully qualified teaching professional in Hong Kong working in a state or government-funded school, one needs to have successfully completed a [[Postgraduate Diploma in Education]] ("PGDE") or a bachelor's degree in [[Education]] ("BEd") at an approved tertiary educational institution or university. This requirement is set out by the Educational Department Bureau of Hong Kong, which is the governmental department that governs the Hong Kong education sector.

==Autonomy==
Professions tend to be autonomous, which means they have a high degree of control of their own affairs: ''"professionals are autonomous insofar as they can make independent judgments about their work"''.&lt;ref&gt;Bayles, Michael D. ''Professional Ethics.'' Belmont, California: Wadsworth, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; This usually means ''"the freedom to exercise their professional judgement."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/20archives/a21/ "The World Medical Association Declaration of Madrid on Professional Autonomy and Self-Regulation", 1987.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205094738/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/20archives/a21/ |date=5 December 2010 }} Revised in France in 2005, rescinded and archived in India in 2009, and rewritten and adopted in India in 2009 as [http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/r4/index.html "WMA Declaration of Madrid on Professionally-led Regulation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827010024/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/r4/index.html |date=27 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it also has other meanings. ''"Professional autonomy is often described as a claim of professionals that has to serve primarily their own interests...this professional autonomy can only be maintained if members of the profession subject their activities and decisions to a critical evaluation by other members of the profession "''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1009925423036 |pmid=11142442 |year=2000 |last1=Hoogland |first1=Jan |title=Professional autonomy and the normative structure of medical practice |journal=Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=457–75 |last2=Jochemsen |first2=Henk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of autonomy can therefore be seen to embrace not only judgement, but also self-interest and a continuous process of critical evaluation of ethics and procedures from within the profession itself.

One major implication of professional autonomy is the traditional ban on corporate practice of the professions, especially accounting, architecture, medicine, and law. This means that in many jurisdictions, these professionals cannot do business through regular for-profit corporations and raise capital rapidly through [[initial public offering|initial public offerings or flotation]]s.  Instead, if they wish to practice collectively they must form special business entities such as partnerships or [[professional corporation]]s, which feature (1) reduced protection against liability for professional negligence and (2) severe limitations or outright prohibitions on ownership by non-professionals.  The obvious implication of this is that all equity owners of the professional business entity must be professionals themselves.  This avoids the possibility of a non-professional owner of the firm telling a professional how to do his or her job and thereby protects professional autonomy.  The idea is that the ''only'' non-professional person who should be telling the professional what to do is the ''client''; in other words, professional autonomy preserves the integrity of the two-party professional-client relationship.  But because professional business entities are effectively locked out of the stock market, they tend to grow relatively slowly compared to public corporations.

==Status and prestige==
{{Main article|Occupational prestige}}
Professions enjoy a high [[social status]], regard and esteem conferred upon them by society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Ron |last1=Tinsley |first2=James C. |last2=Hardy |year=2003 |title=Faculty pressures and professional self-esteem: Life in Texas teacher education |journal=Essays in Education |volume=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcpath.org/index.asp?PageID=28 |title=Royal College of Pathologists, '&amp;#39;The role of the College and benefits of membership,'&amp;#39; 16 Dec 2005 |publisher=Rcpath.org |date=2008-05-20 |accessdate=2009-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510001856/http://www.rcpath.org/index.asp?PageID=28 |archivedate=10 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This high esteem arises primarily from the higher social function of their work, which is regarded as vital to society as a whole and thus of having a special and valuable nature. All professions involve technical, specialized and highly skilled work often referred to as ''"professional [[expertise]]."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1258/095148404323043136 |pmid=15198857 |title=The role of professional expertise in the purchasing of health services |journal=Health Services Management Research |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=110–20 |year=2016 |last1=Lian |first1=P. C. S |last2=Laing |first2=A. W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Training for this work involves obtaining degrees and professional qualifications (see [[Licensure]]) without which entry to the profession is barred ([[occupational closure]]). Updating skills through [[continuing education]] is required through training.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

==Power==
All professions have power.&lt;ref&gt;Terence Johnson, ''Professions and Power,'' London: Heinemann, 1972.{{pn|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This power is used to control its own members, and also its area of expertise and interests. A profession tends to dominate, police and protect its area of expertise and the conduct of its members, and exercises a dominating influence over its entire field which means that professions can act monopolist,&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Larkin, ''Occupational Monopoly and Modern Medicine'', London: Tavistock, 1983.{{pn|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; rebuffing competition from ancillary trades and occupations, as well as subordinating and controlling lesser but related trades.&lt;ref&gt;Peter E. S. Freund and Meredith B. McGuire. ''Health, Illness, and the Social Body: A Critical Sociology'', New Jersey, USA: Prentice Hall, 1995, p.211.&lt;/ref&gt;  A profession is characterized by the power and high prestige it has in society as a whole. It is the power, prestige and value that society confers upon a profession that more clearly defines it. The power of professions has led to them being referred to as [[conspiracies against the laity]].
On the other hand, professionals acquire some of their power and authority in organizations from their expertise and [[knowledge]]. As such they can bend rules, reduce bureaucratic inertia and increase problem solving and adaptability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Guy Benveniste]]|title=Professionalizing the Organization|year=1987|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco}}{{pn|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
There is considerable agreement about defining the characteristic features of a profession. They have a "professional association, cognitive base, institutionalized training, licensing, [[work autonomy]], colleague control... (and) code of ethics",&lt;ref&gt;Magali Sarfatti Larson, ''The Rise of Professionalism: a Sociological Analysis,'' Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt; to which Larson then also adds, "high standards of professional and intellectual excellence," (Larson, p.&amp;nbsp;221) that "professions are occupations with special power and prestige", (Larson, p.x) and that they comprise "an exclusive [[elite]] group," (Larson, p.&amp;nbsp;20) in all societies. Members of a profession have also been defined as "workers whose qualities of detachment, autonomy, and group allegiance are more extensive than those found among other groups...their attributes include a high degree of systematic knowledge; strong community orientation and [[loyalty]]; self-regulation; and a system of rewards defined and administered by the community of workers."&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Brown, ''The Definition of a Profession: the Authority of Metaphor in the History of Intelligence Testing, 1890-1930'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;19&lt;/ref&gt;

A profession has been further defined as: "a special type of occupation...(possessing) corporate solidarity...prolonged specialized training in a body of abstract knowledge, and a collectivity or service orientation...a vocational sub-culture which comprises implicit codes of behavior, generates an [[esprit de corps]] among members of the same profession, and ensures them certain occupational advantages...(also) bureaucratic structures and monopolistic privileges to perform certain types of work...professional literature, legislation, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turner |first1=C. |last2=Hodge |first2=M. N. |chapter=Occupations and Professions |pages=19–50 |chapterurl={{Google books|7ydCAAAAIAAJ|page=19|plainurl=yes}} |editor1-first=J. A. |editor1-last=Jackson |year=1970 |title=Professions and Professionalization |series=Sociological Studies |isbn=978-0-521-07982-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A critical characteristic of a profession is the need to cultivate and exercise professional ''discretion'' - that is, the ability to make case by case ''judgements'' that cannot be determined by an absolute rule or instruction.&lt;ref name=pmid12004638&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/chp.1340220102 |pmid=12004638 |title=Developing professional judgment |journal=Journal of Continuing Education in the Health Professions |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=3–10 |year=2002 |last1=Coles |first1=Colin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liveaudioequip.jpg|right|thumb|350px|A portable setup of various live audio production and recording equipment]]

'''Professional audio''', abbreviated as '''pro audio''', refers to both an activity and a category of high quality, studio-grade audio equipment. Typically it encompasses [[sound recording]], [[sound reinforcement system]] setup and [[audio mixing]], and [[music producer|studio music production]] by trained [[sound engineer]]s, [[audio engineer]]s, [[record producer]]s, and audio technicians who work in [[live event support]] and recording using [[audio mixer]]s, recording equipment and sound reinforcement systems. In contrast, [[consumer electronics|consumer audio]] equipment is a lower grade of gear which is used by regular people for the reproduction of sound in a private home on a [[home stereo]] or [[home cinema]] system.

Professional audio can include, but is not limited to [[broadcast radio]], [[audio mastering]] in a [[recording studio]], [[television studio]], and [[sound reinforcement]] such as a live concert, [[DJ]] performances, [[Sampling (music)|audio sampling]], [[public address]] system set up, [[surround sound]] design in [[movie theatre]]s, and design and setup of [[piped music]] in hotels and restaurants. Professional audio equipment is sold at [[professional audio store]]s and [[music store]]s. While [[consumer electronics]] stores sell some of the same categories of equipment (e.g., [[power amplifier]]s and [[subwoofer]] cabinets), the equipment that consumer stores sells is a lower consumer-grade type of equipment, which does not meet the standards for low noise and low [[distortion (music)|distortion]] that are required in pro audio applications.

==Definition==
The term ''professional audio'' has no precise definition, but it typically includes:
* Operations carried out by trained [[audio engineers]]
* The capturing of sound with one or more [[microphone]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Alten | first=S.R. | title=Audio in Media | publisher=Cengage Learning | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-285-67529-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lesWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 | accessdate=January 12, 2017 | page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Balancing, mixing and adjusting sound signals from [[multitrack recording]] devices using a [[mixing console]]
* The control of audio levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Reinhardt | first=R. | last2=Dowd | first2=S. | title=Adobe Flash CS3 Professional Bible | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | series=Bible | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-470-11937-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQs0sJ0NLDsC&amp;pg=PA1165 | accessdate=January 12, 2017 | page=1165}}&lt;/ref&gt; using standardised types of metering
* Sound signals passing through lengthy [[airchain|signal chain]]s involving processes at different times and places, involving a variety of skills
* Compliance with organisational, national and international practices and standards established by such bodies as the [[International Telecommunication Union]], [[Audio Engineering Society]] and [[European Broadcasting Union]]
* Setting up or designing sound reinforcement systems or recording studios.
==Equipment==
Compared to consumer-grade audio equipment, professional audio equipment tends to have such characteristics as:
* Greater mechanical robustness and reliability
* Many more options for "tweakability" and modification than typical consumer grade equipment. For example, whereas a typical home audio grade active subwoofer may have a factory set-[[audio crossover]] to determine at which point the audio signal will be routed to the subwoofer and a factory preset phase control and equalizer setting, pro audio active subwoofers (with built-in amplifiers and electronics) may offer adjustable crossover points, user-selectable phase control and equalizer controls{{efn|Some expensive, high-end [[hi-fi]] active subwoofers also offer "tweakability" and user controls, but the low-priced active subs sold at [[Big box]] [[consumer electronics]] stores do not usually include these features.}}
* Heavy-duty industrial-grade connectors, e.g. [[XLR connector|XLR]] balanced audio cables (for audio signals) rather than unbalanced cables and [[Speakon]] speaker connectors, rather than 1/4" speaker jacks
* Designed for touring and transportation. This includes the use of [[19-inch rack]]-mount devices for electronic [[effects unit]]s and [[power amplifier]]s, the provision of handles and/or dolly wheels on heavy equipment to facilitate moving gear onstage (large [[speaker enclosure]] cabinets for [[subwoofer]]s and [[sound reinforcement system]] main speakers typically have handles and wheels)
* [[Balanced audio]] interfaces (XLR) for lower noise and hum
* Higher [[analog audio]] signal levels of 0 [[decibel|dBu]] or more&lt;ref name="“books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sound Reinforcement Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7ft6F8ZUdcC&amp;pg=PA325&amp;lpg=PA325&amp;dq=professional+audio+equipment+characteristics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1iWT0zIa5p&amp;sig=FLVzefRE9IQZi2or8bZnWP42rwg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OnE6VfGIGYmoNon_gcAG&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=professional%20audio%20equipment%20characteristics&amp;f=false/|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[AES3|AES/EBU]] [[digital audio]] interfaces
* Lower-noise audio equipment with less [[Total Harmonic Distortion]]

The [[broadcast quality]] of professional audio equipment is on a par with that of consumer [[high-end audio]] and [[hi-fi]] equipment, but is more likely to be designed purely on sound engineering principles and owes little to the consumer-oriented [[audiophile]] sub-culture.&lt;ref name=perlman1&gt;{{Cite journal

A professional audio store is a retail establishment that sells, and in many cases rents, expensive, high-end [[sound recording]] equipment ([[microphone]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gardner | first=S. | last2=Birley | first2=S. | title=Blogging For Dummies | publisher=Wiley | series=For dummies | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-118-23925-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iM5-y-XlCQcC&amp;pg=PA229 | accessdate=January 12, 2017 | page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[audio mixer]]s, [[digital audio recorder]]s, speakers and surround sound speakers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hanes | first=W. | title=The 30-30 Career: Making 30 Grand in 30 Seconds!: Becoming a Platinum Composer | publisher=AuthorHouse | issue=v. 2 | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-4520-5097-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNhmVCpyibAC&amp;pg=PA67 | accessdate=January 12, 2017 | page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Studio monitor|monitor speakers]]) and [[sound reinforcement system]] gear (e.g., [[speaker enclosure]] cabinets, [[Foldback (sound engineering)|stage monitor speakers]], [[power amplifier]]s, [[subwoofer]] cabinets) and accessories used in both settings, such as [[microphone stand]]s. Some pro audio stores also sell video equipment, such as [[video projector]]s, as this equipment is commonly used in live audio settings (e.g., business presentations and conventions). Some pro audio stores also sell and/or rent [[DJ]] gear ([[record turntable]]s, [[DJ mixer]]s) and the [[stage lighting]] equipment used in rock concerts, [[dance club]]s, [[rave]]s and [[theater]]/[[musical theater]] shows.

'''Promise Theory''', in the context of [[information science]], is a model of voluntary cooperation between individual, [[autonomous agent|autonomous actors or agents]] who publish their intentions to one another in the form of promises. It is a form of labelled graph theory, describing discrete networks of agents joined by the unilateral promises they make.

A '''promise''' is a declaration of intent whose purpose is to increase the recipient's certainty about a claim of past, present or future behaviour.&lt;ref name="Burgess" &gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11568285_9 M. Burgess, An Approach to Understanding Policy Based on Autonomy and Voluntary Cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt; For a promise to increase certainty, the recipient needs to trust the promiser, but trust can also be built on the [[verification theory|verification]] (or '''assessment''') that previous promises have been kept, thus trust plays a symbiotic relationship with promises. Each agent assesses its belief in the promise's outcome or intent. Thus Promise Theory is about the [[wikt:relativity|relativity]] of autonomous agents.

One of the goals of Promise Theory is to offer a model that unifies the physical (or dynamical) description of an information system with its intended meaning, i.e. its [[semantics]]. This has been used to describe [[configuration management]] of resources in information systems, amongst other things.

== History ==

Promise Theory was proposed by [[Mark Burgess (computer scientist)|Mark Burgess]] in 2004, in the context of computer science, in order to solve problems present in obligation-based computer management schemes for [[policy-based management]].&lt;ref name="Burgess" /&gt; However its usefulness was quickly seen to go far beyond computing. The simple model of a promise used in Promise Theory (now called 'micro-promises') can easily address matters of Economics and Organization. Promise Theory has since been developed by Burgess in collaboration with Dutch computer scientist [[Jan Bergstra]], resulting in a book: Promise Theory: Principles and Applications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Promise-Theory-Principles-Applications-Volume/dp/1495437779/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391713533&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=promise+theory Promise Theory: Principles and Applications]&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2013.

Interest in promise theory has grown in the IT industry, with several products citing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://markburgess.org/TIpromises.html Thinking in Promises, O'Reilly, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/article/2449562/sdn/promise-theory-mark-burgess-cfengine-sdn-cisco-aci-apic-opflex.html Promise Theory: Can you really trust the network to keep promises?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://jmplank.wordpress.com/tag/promise-theory/ ACI Policy Model: Introduction to some of the fundamentals of an ACI Policy and how it’s enforced]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nojitter.com/post/240169790/why-you-need-to-know-about-promise-theory Why you need to know about promise theory]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vmiss.net/infrastructure/opflex-ing-your-cisco-application-centric-infrastructure/ OpFlex-ing Your Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2016/06/chef-just-took-big-step-quest-make-code-work-like-biology/ The Quest to Make Code Work Like Biology Just Took A Big Step (Wired 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Autonomy ==

Obligations, rather than promises have been the traditional way of guiding behaviour.&lt;ref name="ArXiv 3294" &gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3294 [0810.3294&amp;#93; A static theory of promises&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Promise Theory's point of departure from [[Deontological ethics|obligation logics]] is the idea that all agents in a system should have autonomy of control—i.e. that they cannot be coerced or forced into a specific behaviour. Obligation theories in computer science often view an obligation as a deterministic command that causes its proposed outcome. In Promise Theory an agent may only make promises about its own behaviour. For autonomous agents it is meaningless to make promises about another's behaviour.

Although this assumption could be interpreted morally or ethically, in Promise Theory this is simply a pragmatic `engineering' principle, which leads to a more complete documentation of the intended roles of the actors or agents within the whole. The reason for this is that, when one is not allowed to make assumptions about others' behaviour, one is forced to document every promise more completely in order to make predictions; thus it leads to a more complete documentation which in turn points out the possible failure modes by which cooperative behaviour could fail.

Command and control systems like those that motivate obligation theories can easily be reproduced by having agents voluntarily promise to follow the instructions of another agent (this is also viewed as a more realistic model of behaviour). Since a promise can always be withdrawn, there is no contradiction between voluntary cooperation and command and control.

In Philosophy and Law a promise is often viewed as something that leads to an obligation. Promise Theory rejects that point of view. Bergstra and Burgess have shown that the concept of a promise is quite independent of that of obligation and indeed is simpler.&lt;ref name="ArXiv 3294" /&gt;

The role of obligations in increasing certainty is unclear, since obligations can come from anywhere and an aggregation of non-local constraints cannot be resolved by a local agent: this means that obligations can actually increase uncertainty. In a world of promises, all constraints on an agent are self-imposed and local (even if they are suggested by outside agents), thus all contradictions can be resolved locally.

== Multi-agent systems and commitments ==

The theory of commitments in [[multi-agent system]]s has some similarities with aspects of promise theory, but there are key differences. In Promise Theory a commitment is a subset of intentions. Since a promise is a published intention, a commitment may or may not be a promise. A detailed comparison of Promises and Commitments in the senses intended in their respective fields is forthcoming, and not a trivial matter.

== Economics ==

Promises can be valuable to the promisee or even to the promiser. They might also lead to costs. There is thus an economic story to tell about promises. The economics of promises naturally motivate `selfish agent' behaviour and Promise Theory can be seen as a motivation for game theoretical decision making, in which multiple promises play the role of strategies in a game.&lt;ref&gt;http://project.iu.hio.no/papers/pcm.2.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of promises as applied to [[organization]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Laws of Human-Computer Behaviour and Collective Organization}} http://research.iu.hio.no/papers/organization.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; bears some resemblance to the theory of Institutional Diversity by [[Elinor Ostrom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Institutional Diversity |last=Ostrom |first=Elinor |year=2005 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |location= |isbn=0-691-12238-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several of the same themes and consideration appear; the main difference is that Ostrom focuses, like many authors, on the role of external rules and obligations. Promise Theory takes the opposite viewpoint that obeyance of rules is a voluntary act and hence it makes sense to focus on those voluntary promises. An attempt to force obeyance without a promise is considered to constitute an attack.
One benefit of a Promise Theory approach is that it does not require special structural elements (e.g. Ostrom's institutional "Positions") to describe different roles in a collaborate network—these may also be viewed as promises in Promise Theory; thus there is a parsimony that helps to avoid an explosion of concepts, and perhaps more importantly admits mathematical formalization. The algebra and calculus of promises allows simple reasoning in a mathematical framework.

== CFEngine ==

In spite of the generality of Promise Theory, it was originally proposed by Burgess as a way of modelling the computer management software [[CFEngine]] and its autonomous behaviour. Existing theories based on obligation were unsuitable. CFEngine uses a model of autonomy both as a way of avoiding distributed inconsistency in policy and as a security principle against external attack: no agent can be forced to receive information or instructions from another agent, thus all cooperation is voluntary. For many users of the software, this property has been instrumental in both keeping their systems safe and adapting to the local requirements.

== Emergent behaviour ==

In [[computer science]], the '''Promise theory''' describes policy governed services, in a framework of completely autonomous agents, which assist one another by voluntary cooperation alone. It is a framework for analyzing realistic models of modern networking, and as a formal model for [[swarm intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Burgess, S. Fagernes (2006), ''Promise theory - a model of autonomous objects for pervasive computing and swarms'', Oslo University College, {{ISBN|0-7695-2622-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promise theory may be viewed as a logical and graph theoretical framework for understanding complex relationships in networks, where many constraints have to be met, which was developed at [[Oslo University College]], by drawing on ideas from several different lines of research conducted there, including policy based management, graph theory, logic and [[configuration management]]. It uses a constructivist approach that builds conventional management structures from graphs of interacting, autonomous agents. Promises can be asserted either from an agent to itself or from one agent to another and each promise implies a constraint on the behavior of the promising agent. The atomicity of the promises makes them a tool for finding contradictions and inconsistencies.

== Agency as a model of systems in space and time ==

The promises made by autonomous agents lead to a mutually approved [[graph (data structure)|graph]] structure, which in turn leads to spatial structures in which the agents represent point-like locations. This allows models of '''smart spaces''', i.e. semantically labeled or even functional spaces, such as databases, knowledge maps, warehouses, hotels, etc., to be unified with other more conventional descriptions of space and time. The model of [[semantic spacetime]] uses promise theory to discuss these spacetime concepts.

Promises are more mathematically primitive than graph adjacencies, since a link requires the mutual consent of two autonomous agents, thus the concept of a connected space requires more work to build structure. This makes them mathematically interesting as a notion of space, and offers a useful way of modeling physical and virtual information systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5563 M.

'''Proxemics''' is the study of human use of space and the effects that population density has on behaviour, communication, and social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proxemics|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/proxemics|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxemics is one among several subcategories in the study of [[nonverbal communication]], including [[Haptic communication|haptics]] (touch), [[kinesics]] (body movement), [[paralanguage|vocalics]] (paralanguage), and [[chronemics]] (structure of time).&lt;ref name="nina moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Nina|title=Nonverbal Communication:Studies and Applications|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward T. Hall]], the cultural anthropologist who coined the term in 1963, defined proxemics as "the interrelated observations and theories of humans use of space as a specialized elaboration of culture".&lt;ref name="Hidden Dimension"&gt;{{cite book| last = Hall| first = Edward T.| title = The Hidden Dimension| year = 1966| publisher = Anchor Books| isbn = 0-385-08476-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his foundational work on proxemics, ''The Hidden Dimension,'' Hall emphasized the impact of proxemic behavior (the use of space) on [[interpersonal communication]]. According to Hall, the study of proxemics is valuable in evaluating not only the way people interact with others in daily life, but also "the organization of space in [their] houses and buildings, and ultimately the layout of [their] towns".&lt;ref name="Hall2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=Edward T.|date=October 1963|title=A System for the Notation of Proxemic Behavior|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=65|issue=5|pages=1003–1026|doi=10.1525/aa.1963.65.5.02a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxemics remains a hidden component of interpersonal communication that is uncovered through observation and strongly influenced by culture.

&lt;!-- This article explores proxemics by elaborating on the interpersonal distances of man, the organization of space as territories, the cultural factors related to proxemics, and applied research into the ways that communication technologies shape current studies of proxemics in everyday life. --&gt;
== Human distances ==

=== Interpersonal distance ===
[[Edward T. Hall|Hall]] described the interpersonal distances of man (the relative distances between people) in four distinct zones: (1) intimate space, (2) personal space, (3) social space, and (4) public space.

==== Horizontal ====
[[File:Personal Space.svg|thumb|A chart depicting [[Edward T. Hall]]'s interpersonal distances of man, showing [[radius]] in feet and meters]]
* '''[[Intimacy|Intimate]] distance''' for embracing, touching or whispering
** ''Close phase''&amp;nbsp;– less than 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;cm
** ''Far phase''&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|6|to|18|in|cm}}
* '''Personal distance''' for interactions among good [[friendship|friends]] or [[family]]
** ''Close phase''&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|1.5|to|2.5|ft|cm}}
** ''Far phase''&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|2.5|to|4|ft|cm}}
* '''Social distance''' for interactions among acquaintances
** ''Close phase''&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|4|to|7|ft|m}}
** ''Far phase''&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|7|to|12|ft|m}}
* '''Public distance''' used for public speaking
** ''Close phase''&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|12|to|25|ft|m}}
** ''Far phase''&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|25|ft|m}} or more.

The distance surrounding a person forms a space. The space within intimate distance and personal distance is called ''personal space''. The space within social distance and out of personal distance is called ''social space''. And the space within public distance is called ''public space''.

Personal space is the region surrounding a person which they regard as psychologically theirs. Most people value their personal space and feel discomfort, anger, or anxiety when their personal space is encroached.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hall | first = Edward T. | title = The Hidden Dimension | publisher = Anchor Books | year = 1966 | isbn = 0-385-08476-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Permitting a person to enter personal space and entering somebody else's personal space are indicators of perception of those people's relationship. An intimate zone is reserved for close friends, lovers, children and close family members. Another zone is used for conversations with friends, to chat with associates, and in group discussions. A further zone is reserved for strangers, newly formed groups, and new acquaintances. A fourth zone is used for speeches, lectures, and theater; essentially, public distance is that range reserved for larger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Engleberg, Isa N.|title=Working in Groups: Communication Principles and Strategies|series=My Communication Kit Series|year=2006|pages=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entering somebody's personal space is normally an indication of familiarity and sometimes intimacy. However, in modern society, especially in crowded urban communities, it can be difficult to maintain personal space, for example when in a crowded [[train]], [[elevator]] or street. Many people find such physical proximity to be psychologically disturbing and uncomfortable,&lt;ref name="Hall" /&gt; though it is accepted as a fact of modern life. In an impersonal, crowded situation, eye contact tends to be avoided. Even in a crowded place, preserving personal space is important, and intimate and [[sexual contact]], such as [[frotteurism]] and [[groping]], is unacceptable physical contact.

The [[amygdala]] is suspected of processing people's strong reactions to personal space violations since these are absent in those in which it is damaged and it is activated when people are physically close.&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Kennedy DP, Gläscher J, Tyszka JM, Adolphs R|year=2009|title=Personal space regulation by the human amygdala|journal=Nat. Neurosci.|volume=12|pages=1226–1227|pmid=19718035|doi=10.1038/nn.2381|pmc=2753689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research links the amygdala with emotional reactions to proximity to other people. First, it is activated by such proximity, and second, in those with complete bilateral damage to their amygdala, such as [[S.M. (patient)|patient S.M.]], lack a sense of personal space boundary.&lt;ref name="Kennedy" /&gt; As the researchers have noted: "Our findings suggest that the amygdala may mediate the repulsive force that helps to maintain a minimum distance between people. Further, our findings are consistent with those in monkeys with bilateral amygdala lesions, who stay within closer proximity to other monkeys or people, an effect we suggest arises from the absence of strong emotional responses to personal space violation."&lt;ref name="Kennedy" /&gt;

A person's personal space is carried with them everywhere they go. It is the most inviolate form of territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richmond|first=Virginia|title=Nonverbal Behavior in Interpersonal Relations|year=2008|publisher=Pearson/A and B|location=Boston|isbn=9780205042302|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Body spacing and [[Posture (psychology)|posture]], according to Hall, are unintentional reactions to sensory fluctuations or shifts, such as subtle changes in the sound and pitch of a person's voice. Social distance between people is reliably correlated with physical distance, as are intimate and personal distance, according to the delineations below.  Hall did not mean for these measurements to be strict guidelines that translate precisely to human behavior, but rather a system for gauging the effect of distance on communication and how the effect varies between cultures and other environmental factors.

==== Vertical ====
The distances mentioned above are horizontal distance. There is also vertical distance that communicates something between people. In this case, however, vertical distance is often understood to convey the degree of dominance or sub-ordinance in a relationship. Looking up at or down on another person can be taken literally in many cases, with the higher person asserting greater status.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.creducation.org/resources/nonverbal_communication/proxemics.html|title=Proxemics|website=www.creducation.org|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers, and especially those who work with small children, should realize that students will interact more comfortably with a teacher when they are in same vertical plane. Used in this way, an understanding of vertical distance can become a tool for improved teacher-student communication. On the other hand, a disciplinarian might put this information to use in order to gain psychological advantage over an unruly student.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Biometrics ===
{{Main article|Biometrics}}
Hall used biometric concepts to categorize, explain, and explore the ways people connect in space. These variations in positioning are impacted by a variety of nonverbal communicative factors, listed below.

* '''Kinesthetic factors''': This category deals with how closely the participants are to touching, from being completely outside of body-contact distance to being in physical contact, which parts of the body are in contact, and body part positioning.
* '''[[Haptic communication|Haptic]] code''': This behavioral category concerns how participants are touching one another, such as [[caressing]], holding, feeling, prolonged holding, spot touching, pressing against, accidental brushing, or not touching at all.
* '''Visual code''': This category denotes the amount of [[eye contact]] between participants. Four sub-categories are defined, ranging from eye-to-eye contact to no eye contact at all.
* '''Thermal code''': This category denotes the amount of [[body heat]] that each participant perceives from another. Four sub-categories are defined: [[heat conduction|conducted heat]] detected, [[thermal radiation|radiant heat]] detected, heat probably detected, and no detection of heat.
* '''[[Olfaction|Olfactory]] code''': This category deals in the kind and degree of [[odour|odor]] detected by each participant from the other.
* '''Voice loudness''': This category deals in the [[vocal effort]] used in speech. Seven sub-categories are defined: silent, very soft, soft, normal, normal+, loud, and very loud.

=== Neuropsychology ===
{{Main article|Neuropsychology}}
Whereas Hall's work uses human interactions to demonstrate spatial variation in proxemics, the field of neuropsychology describes personal space in terms of the kinds of "nearness" to an individual body.
* '''Extrapersonal space''': The space that occurs outside the reach of an individual.
* '''[[Michael Graziano#Peripersonal space|Peripersonal space]]''': The space within reach of any limb of an individual. Thus, to be "within arm's length" is to be within one's peripersonal space.
* '''Pericutaneous space''': The space just outside our bodies but which might be near to touching it. Visual-tactile perceptive fields overlap in processing this space. For example, an individual might see a feather as not touching their skin but still experience the sensation of being tickled when it hovers just above their hand. Other examples include the blowing of wind, gusts of air, and the passage of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Elias, L.J., M.S., Saucier|year=2006|title=Neuropsychology: Clinical and Experimental Foundations|location=Boston; MA|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|isbn=0-205-34361-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Previc, F.H.|year=1998|title=The neuropsychology of 3D space|journal=Psychol. Bull.|volume=124|issue=2|pages=123–164|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.123|pmid=9747184}}&lt;/ref&gt; further subdivides extrapersonal space into ''focal-extrapersonal'' space, ''action-extrapersonal'' space, and ''ambient-extrapersonal'' space.  Focal-extrapersonal space is located in the lateral temporo-frontal pathways at the center of our vision, is retinotopically centered and tied to the position of our eyes, and is involved in object search and  recognition.  Action-extrapersonal-space is located in the medial temporo-frontal pathways, spans the entire space, and is head-centered and involved in orientation and locomotion in topographical space.  Action-extrapersonal space provides the "presence" of our world.   Ambient-extrapersonal space initially courses through the peripheral parieto-occipital visual pathways before joining up with vestibular and other body senses to control posture and orientation in earth-fixed/gravitational space.  Numerous studies involving peripersonal and extrapersonal neglect have shown that peripersonal space is located dorsally in the parietal lobe whereas extrapersonal space is housed ventrally in the temporal lobe.

==Organization of space in territories==
[[Image:PerSpa1.png|220px|right|thumb|Two people not affecting each other's personal space]]
[[Image:PerSpa2.png|220px|right|thumb|Reaction of two people whose regions of personal space are in conflict]]While personal space describes the immediate space surrounding a person, territory refers to the area which a person may "lay claim to" and defend against others.&lt;ref name="nina moore" /&gt; There are four forms of human territory in proxemic theory.  They are:
* '''Public territory''': a place where one may freely enter. This type of territory is rarely in the constant control of just one person. However, people might come to temporarily own areas of public territory.
* '''Interactional territory''': a place where people congregate informally
* '''Home territory''': a place where people continuously have control over their individual territory
* '''Body territory''': the space immediately surrounding us
These different levels of territory, in addition to factors involving personal space, suggest ways for us to communicate and produce expectations of appropriate behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyman|first=S.M.|author2=Scott, M.B. |title=Territoriality: A Neglected Sociological Dimension|journal=Social Problems|year=1967|volume=15|pages=236–249|doi=10.1525/sp.1967.15.2.03a00090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to spatial territories, the interpersonal territories between conversants can be determined by "[[wikt:sociopetal|socio-petal]] [[wikt:sociofugal|socio-fugal]] axis",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sommer|first=Robert|year=May 1967|title=Sociofugal Space|journal=American Journal of Sociology|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|volume=27|issue=6|pages=654–660}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "angle formed by the axis of the conversants' shoulders".&lt;ref name="nina moore" /&gt;  Hall has also studied combinations of postures between dyads (two people) including lying prone, sitting, or standing.

==Cultural factors==
Personal space is highly variable, due to [[cultural diversity|cultural differences]] and personal preferences. On average, preferences vary significantly between countries. A 2017 study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorokowska|first1=Agnieszka|last2=Sorokowski|first2=Piotr|last3=Hilpert|first3=Peter|title=Preferred Interpersonal Distances: A Global Comparison|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|date=22 March 2017|pages=0022022117698039|doi=10.1177/0022022117698039|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022117698039|language=en|issn=0022-0221|volume=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that personal space preferences with respect to strangers ranged between more than 120&amp;nbsp;cm in Romania, Hungary and Saudi Arabia, and less than 90&amp;nbsp;cm in Argentina, Peru, Ukraine and Bulgaria.

The cultural practices of the [[United States]] show considerable similarities to those in northern and central European regions, such as [[Germany]], [[Scandinavia]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. Greeting rituals tend to be the same in Europe and in the United States, consisting of minimal body contact—often confined to a simple handshake. The main cultural difference in proxemics is that residents of the United States like to keep more open space between themselves and their conversation partners (roughly {{convert|4|ft|m}} compared to {{convert|2|to(-)|3|ft|m|1}} in Europe).&lt;ref name="Edward Hall, the hidden dimension online abstract"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiss.org/classics/content/13|title=Edward Hall, the hidden dimension online abstract|accessdate=2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; European cultural history has seen a change in personal space since [[Roman Empire|Roman times]], along with the boundaries of public and private space. This topic has been explored in ''A History of Private Life'' (2001), under the general editorship of [[Philippe Ariès]] and [[Georges Duby]].&lt;ref&gt;''Histoire de la vie privée'' (2001), editors [[Philippe Ariès]] and [[Georges Duby]]; le Grand livre du mois. {{ISBN|978-2020364171}}. Published in English as ''A History of Private Life'' by the Belknap Press. {{ISBN|978-0674399747}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, those living in densely populated places likely have lower expectations of personal space. Residents of [[India]] or [[Japan]] tend to have a smaller personal space than those in the [[Mongolia]]n [[steppe]], both in regard to [[home]] and [[individual]] spaces. Different expectations of personal space can lead to difficulties in intercultural communication.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

Hall notes that different culture types maintain different standards of personal space.  Realizing and recognizing these cultural differences improves [[cross-cultural communication|cross-cultural understanding]], and helps eliminate discomfort people may feel if the interpersonal distance is too large ("stand-offish") or too small (intrusive).

===Adaptation===
People make exceptions to and modify their space requirements. A number of relationships may allow for personal space to be modified, including familial ties, romantic partners, friendships and close acquaintances, where there is a greater degree of trust and personal knowledge. Personal space is affected by a person's position in society, with more affluent individuals expecting a larger personal space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Charisma-Seven-Developing-Magnetism-Success/dp/0446675989|title=Charisma: Seven Keys to Developing the Magnetism that Leads to Success|last=Alessandra|first=Tony|date=2000-02-01|publisher=Business Plus|isbn=9780446675987|location=New York|pages=165–192|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal space also varies by gender and age. Males typically use more personal space than females, and personal space has a positive relation to age (people use more as they get older). Most people have a fully developed (adult) sense of personal space by age twelve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aiello, John R.|first=Aiello, Tyra De Carlo|date=July 1974|title=The Development of Personal Space: Proxemic Behavior of Children 6 through 16|jstor=4602298|journal=Human Ecology|doi=10.1007/bf01531420|pmid=|volume=2|pages=177–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under circumstances where normal space requirements cannot be met, such as in public transit or elevators, personal space requirements are modified accordingly. According to the psychologist [[Robert Sommer (psychologist)|Robert Sommer]], one method of dealing with violated personal space is '''[[dehumanization]]'''. He argues that on the subway, crowded people often imagine those intruding on their personal space as inanimate. '''Behavior''' is another method:  a person attempting to talk to someone can often cause situations where one person steps forward to enter what they perceive as a conversational distance, and the person they are talking to can step back to restore their personal space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Implementing appropriate '''proxemic cues''' has been shown to improve success in monitored behavioral situations like psychotherapy by increasing patient trust for the therapist (see [[active listening]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Francis D.|date=1972|title=Communicational Significance of Therapist Proxemic Cues|url=http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com/sp-3.18.0b/ovidweb.cgi?WebLinkFrameset=1&amp;S=CAKDFPEMMDDDGADLNCJKGDIBOBLNAA00&amp;returnUrl=ovidweb.cgi%3fMain%2bSearch%2bPage%3d1%26S%3dCAKDFPEMMDDDGADLNCJKGDIBOBLNAA00&amp;directlink=http%3a%2f%2fgraphics.tx.ovid.com%2fovftpdfs%2fFPDDNCIBGDDLMD00%2ffs046%2fovft%2flive%2fgv023%2f00004730%2f00004730-197210000-00033.pdf&amp;filename=Communicational+significance+of+therapist+proxemic+cues.&amp;navigation_links=NavLinks.S.sh.18.1&amp;link_from=S.sh.18%7c1&amp;pdf_key=FPDDNCIBGDDLMD00&amp;pdf_index=/fs046/ovft/live/gv023/00004730/00004730-197210000-00033&amp;D=ovft&amp;link_set=S.sh.18&amp;#124;1&amp;#124;sl_10&amp;#124;resultSet&amp;#124;S.sh.18.19&amp;#124;0|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=39.2|pages=345|doi=10.1037/h0033423|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instructional situations have likewise seen increased success in student performance by lessening the actual or '''perceived distance''' between the student and the educator (perceived distance is manipulated in the case of [[educational technology|instructional videoconferencing]], using technological tricks such as angling the frame and adjusting the zoom).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Michael E.|title=Perceived Proxemic Distance and Instructional Videoconferencing: Impact on Student Performance and Attitude.|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED354558|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that proxemic behavior is also affected when dealing with [[social stigma|stigmatized]] minorities within a population. For example, those who do not have experience dealing with disabled persons tend to create more distance during encounters because they are uncomfortable. Others may judge that the disabled person needs to have an increase of touch, volume, or proximity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1696286801?accountid=11091|title=Proxemic Behavior of the Nonhandicapped Toward the Visually Impaired|last=Olsen|first=Carol J.|publisher=Proquest Dissertations Publishing|year=1989|isbn=|location=University of Nebraska at Omaha|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied research==
The theory of proxemics is often considered in relation to the impact of technology on human relationships. While physical proximity cannot be achieved when people are connected virtually, perceived proximity can be attempted, and several studies have shown that it is a crucial indicator in the effectiveness of virtual communication technologies.&lt;ref name="perceived"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Leary|first=Michael Boyer|author2=Wilson, Jeanne M |author3=Metiu, Anca |author4= Jett, Quintus R |title=Perceived Proximity in Virtual Work: Explaining the Paradox of Far-but-Close|journal=Organization Studies|year=2008|volume=29|issue=7|pages=979–1002 |doi=10.1177/0170840607083105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="monge and kirste"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monge|first=Peter R|author2=Kirste, Kenneth K |title=Measuring Proximity in Human Organization|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|year=1980|volume=43|issue=1|pages=110–115|doi=10.2307/3033753}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dynamics of org proximity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monge|first=Peter R|author2=Rothman, Lynda White |author3=Eisenberg, Eric M |author4=Miller, Katherine I |author5= Kirste, Kenneth K |title=The Dynamics of Organizational Proximity|journal=Management Science|year=1985|volume=31|issue=9|pages=1129–1141|doi=10.1287/mnsc.31.9.1129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="distance matters"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=Gary M|author2=Olson, Judith S |title=Distance Matters|journal=Human Computer Interaction|year=2000|volume=15|pages=139–178|doi=10.1207/s15327051hci1523_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies suggest that various individual and situational factors influence how close we feel to another person, regardless of distance.  The [[mere-exposure effect]] originally referred to the tendency of a person to positively favor those who they have been physically exposed to most often.&lt;ref name="zajonc"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zajonc|first=R.B.|title=Attitudinal Effect of Mere Exposure|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1968|volume=9|pages=2–17|doi=10.1037/h0025848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, recent research has extended this effect to virtual communication.  This work suggests that the more someone communicates virtually with another person, the more he is able to envision that person's appearance and workspace, therefore fostering a sense of personal connection.&lt;ref name="perceived" /&gt;  Increased communication has also been seen to foster [[Common ground (communication technique)|common ground]], or the feeling of identification with another, which leads to positive attributions about that person.  Some studies emphasize the importance of shared physical territory in achieving common ground,&lt;ref name="distrib work"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hinds|first=Pamela|title=Distributed Work|year=2002|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|author2=Kiesler, Sara }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others find that common ground can be achieved virtually, by communicating often.&lt;ref name="perceived" /&gt;

Much research in the fields of communication, [[psychology]], and sociology, especially under the category of [[organizational behavior]],  has shown that physical proximity enhances peoples' ability to work together.  Face-to-face interaction is often used as a tool to maintain the culture, authority, and norms of an organization or workplace.&lt;ref name="org learning"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levitt|first=B|author2=J.G.

R.|title=An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change|year=1982|publisher=Belknap Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An extensive body of research has been written about how proximity is affected by the use of new communication technologies.  The importance of physical proximity in co-workers is often emphasized.

=== Advertising ===
Part of Facebook's earning comes from on-site advertising. During these years, Facebook has offered companies the ability to post and present content in a timeline format on their free brand or business page. By doing so, companies can deliver a more comprehensive promotional message and increase audience engagement. If a user "likes" a brand page, corporate content posted on the brand page will appear in the user's news feed. Many users felt angry about the overly implanted ads that showed up in their Facebook timeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beauchamp, M. B.|year=2013|title=Don't invade my personal space: Facebook's advertising dilemma|journal=Journal of Applied Business Research|volume=29|issue=1|page=91|doi=10.19030/jabr.v29i1.7558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users that consider Facebook advertising "annoying" and "intrusive" may do so because companies are invading their [[Social dominance theory|social domain]] ('''territory''') with targeted, paid-for, corporate communications. Those that "hate" receiving targeted messages on their social media profiles could be experiencing frustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cohen, D.|date=February 23, 2012|title=Brands, maintain a Facebook page, but don't bother me|url=http://www.allfacebook.com/facebook-page-consumers-2012-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that these users are devoting effort to the creation and maintenance of boundaries around their social role, only to have advertisers break through these '''boundaries''' with promotional content.

===Cinema===
Proxemics is an essential component of cinematic [[mise-en-scène]], the placement of characters, props and scenery within a frame, creating visual weight and movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinematography – Proxemics|url=http://www.esfmedia.com/page/Cinematography+-+Proxemics|work=Film and Media Studies in ESF|publisher=South Island School|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two aspects to the consideration of proxemics in this context, the first being '''character proxemics''', which addresses such questions as:  How much space is there between the characters?  What is suggested by characters who are close to (or, conversely, far away from) each other?  Do distances change as the film progresses?  and, Do distances depend on the film's other content?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mise en scene|url=http://filmstudies.uncc.edu/sites/filmstudies.uncc.edu/files/media/mise_en_scene.pdf|work=Film Studies|publisher=University of North Carolina at Charlotte|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other consideration is '''camera proxemics''', which answers the single question: How far away is the camera from the characters/action?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shot and Camera Proxemics|url=http://www.cod.edu/people/faculty/pruter/film/scproxemics.htm|work=The Fifteen Points of Mise-en-scene|publisher=College of DuPage|accessdate=28 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428184521/http://www.cod.edu/people/faculty/pruter/film/scproxemics.htm|archivedate=28 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Analysis of camera proxemics typically relates Hall's system of proxemic patterns to the [[camera angle]] used to create a specific shot, with the [[Long shot|long shot or extreme long shot]] becoming the ''public proxemic'', a full shot (sometimes called a figure shot, complete view, or medium long shot) becoming the ''social proxemic'', the [[medium shot]] becoming the ''personal proxemic'', and the [[Close-up|close up or extreme close up]] becoming the ''intimate proxemic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinematography Part II: MISE-EN-SCENE: Orchestrating the Frame|url=http://courses.csusm.edu/fmst300bc/mise.html|publisher=California State University San Marcos|accessdate=28 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413103352/http://courses.csusm.edu/fmst300bc/mise.html|archivedate=13 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Film analyst Louis Giannetti has maintained that, in general, the greater the distance between the camera and the subject (in other words, the public proxemic), the more emotionally neutral the audience remains, whereas the closer the camera is to a character, the greater the audience's emotional attachment to that character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Giannetti| first = Louis| title = Understanding Movies, 5th edition| year = 1990| publisher = Prentice Hall| location = Englewood Cliffs, N.J.| isbn = 0-13-945585-X| pages = 64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Or, as actor/director [[Charlie Chaplin]] put it:   "Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long shot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roud|first=Richard|title=The Baggy-Trousered Philanthropist|journal=The Guardian|date=28 December 1977|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyberbullying ===
[[Cyberbullying]] is a communication phenomenon in which a bully utilizes electronic media in order to harass peers. Adolescents favor [[texting]] or  [[computer-mediated communication]] as an alternative to the more directly combative face-to-face interactions because it takes advantage of evading imposed [[norm (social)|social norms]] such as "[[school rule]]s", which are likely to be especially repressive of aggression involving females.&lt;ref&gt;"The Future Of Adolescent Female Cyber-Bullying: Electronic Media's Effect On Aggressive Female Communication". ''Jena Ponsford''. Texas State University. Retrieved 27 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Online bullying has a lot in common with bullying in school: Both behaviors include harassment, humiliation, teasing and aggression. Cyberbullying presents unique challenges in the sense that the perpetrator can attempt to be anonymous, and attacks can happen at any time of day or night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/27/health/cyberbullying-online-bully-victims/|title=When bullying goes high-tech|last=Landau|first=Elizabeth|date=February 27, 2013|website=CNN|publisher=|access-date=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main factor that encourages cyber bullying is the fact that a cyber bully can hide behind the shield of online anonymity. In other words, social media magnifies the face-to-face '''social space''' into a '''[[Virtual community|virtual]] space''' where a cyber bully can say anything about the victims without the pressure of facing them.

=== Virtual environments ===

Bailenson, Blascovich, Beall, and Loomis conducted an experiment in 2001, testing Argyle and Dean's (1965) equilibrium theory's speculation of an inverse relationship between mutual gaze, a nonverbal cue signaling intimacy, and interpersonal distance. Participants were [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersed]] in a 3D virtual room in which a virtual human representation (that is, an embodied agent) stood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bailenson, J. N., Blascovich, J., Beall, A. C., &amp; Loomis, J. M.|year=2001|title=Equilibrium theory revisited: Mutual gaze and personal space in virtual environments|journal=Presence: Teleoperators &amp; Virtual Environments|volume=10|issue=6|pages=583–598|doi=10.1162/105474601753272844|url=https://vhil.stanford.edu/mm/2001/bailenson-equilibrium.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of this study is on the ''subtle nonverbal exchanges'' that occur between a person and an embodied agent. Participants in the study clearly did not treat the agent as a mere animation. On the contrary, the results suggest that, in virtual environments, people were influenced by the 3D model and respected personal space of the humanoid representation. The result of the experiment also indicated that women are more affected by the gaze behaviors of the agent and adjust their personal space more accordingly than do men. However, men do subjectively assign gaze behavior to the agent, and their proxemic behavior reflects this perception. Furthermore, both men and women demonstrate less variance in their ''proxemic behavior'' when the agent displays mutual gaze behavior than when the agent does not.

Other researchers have established that proxemics can be a valuable tool for measuring the behavioral realism of an agent or an avatar. People tend to perceive nonverbal gestures on an implicit level, and degree of personal space appears to be an accurate way to measure people's perception of ''[[Social presence theory|social presence]]'' and realism in virtual environments.  Nick Yee in his PhD thesis at Stanford discovered that real world proxemic distances also were applied in the virtual world of [[Second Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yee | first1 = Nick | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2007 | title = Unbearable Likeness of Being Digital: The Persistence of Nonverbal Social Norms in Online Virtual Environments | url = | journal = CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 115–121 | doi=10.1089/cpb.2006.9984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies demonstrate that implicit behavioral measures such as body posture can be a reliable measure of the user's sense of presence in [[virtual environment]]s. Similarly, personal space may be a more reliable measure of social presence than a typical ratings survey in immersive virtual environments.

'''Willowbank''' is an independent educational institution located on the Willowbank [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] and in the village centre of [[Queenston, Ontario]], along the Canada-United States border. It operates a School of Restoration Arts which offers a three-year post-secondary diploma in conservation skills and theory, and a Centre for Cultural Landscape, a forum for [[cultural landscape]] theory and practice in Canada and the world. Willowbank was created from the rescue of a 19th-century estate which today forms the centre of its campus, and it is one of a handful of Canadian organisations of which His Royal Highness [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]] is [[List of Canadian organizations with royal patronage|Royal Patron]].

==School of Restoration Arts==

Founded in 2006, the School of Restoration Arts offers a three-year, post-secondary Diploma in Heritage Conservation which combines academic and apprenticeship learning, taught by over 50 faculty associates who are leading practitioners in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.willowbank.ca/asset/1970/Willowbank_Release.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031135/http://www.willowbank.ca/asset/1970/Willowbank_Release.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} Press Release, The Prince of Wales becomes Royal Patron of Willowbank, May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  The School accepts a maximum of 18 students each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/school-of-restoration-arts/program/admissions/index/] Willowbank Admissions&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centre for Cultural Landscape==

The Willowbank Centre for Cultural Landscape is an initiative that builds on its exploration of [[cultural landscape]] theory and practice to define a particularly Canadian perspective in this area of current discussion and debate. It facilitates a program of lecture series, workshops and publications to promote a connection between cultural landscape and cultural practice, and to advocate for its ecological view of cultural and natural heritage conservation. The Centre also coordinates Willowbank’s seat in global deliberations about conservation, whose participants include a cross-section of board, staff and students. In 2013, Willowbank signed an agreement with the [[UNESCO]]-affiliated World Heritage Institute in Shanghai, China, with a focus on the UNESCO Recommendation for Historic Urban Landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/about-us/new/new/ Willowbank agreement with UNESCO-affiliated World Heritage Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was created in 2012 through a multi-year grant from the [[Ontario Trillium Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.otf.ca/school-restoration-arts-willowbank?redirected=1] Ontario Trillium Foundation, 2012-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

Willowbank's campus is composed of two main parts, a 19th-century estate, and a former village elementary school with its surrounding lands. The former, described in further detail below, traces its history to 8,000 years of human habitation. The landscape of the estate includes a ravine and a hill upon which sits a 19th-century stone mansion. Newly built and re-built outbuildings have been constructed to house student workshops, including a barn and a forge and stone studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/national-historic-site/index/#menu-2] Willowbank National Historic Site&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjacent to the estate is the former Laura Secord School in the centre of the village, bought in 2012 by Willowbank after it was abandoned. The transfer is designed to house school activities while also returning the building and lands to community use and creating affordable housing. Its original wing was constructed in 1914, with substantial additions made in the 1950s. The original, two-classroom building housed students upstairs while the lower level was a centre of village life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2012/03/22/willowbank-buys-old-laura-secord-school] Willowbank buys old Laura Secord School, Niagara Falls Review, March 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field School==
Willowbank runs a three-week field school every summer in partnership with the Canova Association in the [[Ossola|Ossola Valley]] in Northern Italy. It is a microcosm of the diploma program, with an introduction to cultural landscape theory and practice, an experience of documentation and design, and then a major hands-on component. The work involves creative restoration and adaptive reuse of abandoned medieval stone structures, carried out under the direction of Italian masons and craftsmen. It coincides with the International Architect Encounter in the same place, an annual, intimate conference of world leaders in conservation and ecological design, with whom the field school’s participants are able to engage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willowbank.ca/content/beta/home/centre-for-cultural-landscape/short-courses/italy/index/] Willowbank Italy Field School&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Historic Site==

Willowbank's campus includes a designated [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] in the century estate to which it traces its name, also designated under Part IV of the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]'', and further protected by a heritage easement granted to The [[Ontario Heritage Trust]]. It is named after [[willow]] trees that were once located on its grounds, is an example of the rural estates of the wealthy settlers of early 19th century [[Upper Canada]]. Its mansion, which is the centre of campus, was built between 1832 and 1834 for Alexander Hamilton, third son of Robert Hamilton, one of the founders  of Upper Canada. Constructed in the [[Greek Revival]] style of [[architecture]] then at its height in North America for such grand houses, Willowbank's is an example of such buildings on the continent. Designed by architect, John Latshaw, and built of local [[Whirlpool]] [[sandstone]], the building is characterised by the rare features of eight hand-carved columns running its full two-story height, and by a front doorway of Greek design. The 13-acre estate today forms the centre of the Willowbank campus.

'''Social undermining '''is the expression of negative emotions directed towards a particular person or negative evaluations of the person as a way to prevent the person from achieving his or her [[goal]]s. This behavior can often be attributed to certain feelings, such as dislike or [[anger]]. The negative evaluation of the person may involve [[criticizing]] his or her actions, efforts or characteristics.&lt;ref name="Joseph, N. T. 2011"&gt;Joseph, N. T., Myers, H. F., Schettino, J. R., Olmos, N. T., Bingham-Mira, C., Lesser, I. M., &amp; Poland, R. E. (2011). Support and undermining in interpersonal relationships are associated with treatment response to a trial of antidepressant medication. Psychiatry: Interpersonal And Biological Processes, 74(3), 240-254.&lt;/ref&gt; Social undermining is seen in relationships between family members, friends, personal relationships and [[office politics|co-workers]]. Social undermining can affect a person's mental health, including an increase in depressive symptoms. This behavior is only considered social undermining if the person's perceived action is intended to hinder their target. When social undermining is seen in the work environment the behavior is used to hinder the co-worker's ability to establish and maintain a positive [[interpersonal relationship]], success and a good [[reputation]].&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenbaum | first1 = R.

==Definition==
According to Duffy, Gangster, and Pagon, 2002, the definition of social undermining in a workplace is, behavior intended to hinder over time and not allowing a person to establish or maintain positive interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name=duffy&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duffy | first1 = M.K. | last2 = Ganster | first2 = D.C. | last3 = Pagon | first3 = M | year = 2002 | title = Social undermining in the workplace | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 331–352 | doi=10.2307/3069350| jstor = 3069350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the workplace==
Social undermining has been very effective in the workplace.&lt;ref name=duffy/&gt; Various aspects of social undermining have affected the workplace and specific races. In workplaces, social undermining has connection with social interaction. Research has shown if a person has a supportive environment in their work setting, they are more likely to have a more satisfied life. Research has shown that social undermining exists in a separate and distinct continuum when looking at positive workplace behavior (e.g. [[social support]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Social undermining can arise through interactions with co-workers and supervisors; these interactions have an effect on the workers that are being undermined and can affect their work performance. Vinokur found that those who alleged to have social undermining in the workplace reported to have poorer mental health and experienced less well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vinokur | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Van Ryn | first2 = M. | year = 1993 | title = Social support and undermining in close relationships: Their independent effects on the mental health of unemployed persons | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 350–359 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.65.2.350 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.502.7301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study shows that undermining has a significant role in worker-supervisor and co-worker relationship and that it leads to various different outcomes such as feelings of irritability, [[anxiety]], [[depersonalization]], and depression. It shows that social undermining affects a person's work ethics and well being.

Various different empirical studies have found that undermining has three specific factors{{which|date=September 2015}} that develop counterfactual thoughts. For example: "what would my life be like if I were not the target of undermining?" These studies' findings{{which|date=September 2015}} indicate that "this rift plays a role in determining the magnitude of the employee's reaction to the event by making the deprived state more salient".&lt;ref name=folger1998&gt;Folger, R., &amp; Cropanzano, R.

Behaviors of social undermining can affect a person and his or her perceptions. The study conducted by Gant et al. addressed African American workers' perceptions of co-workers and supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gant |first1=LM |last2=Nagda |first2=BA |last3=Brabson |first3=HV |last4=Jayaratne |first4=S |last5=Chess |first5=WA |last6=Singh |first6=A |title=Effects of social support and undermining on African American workers' perceptions of coworker and supervisor relationships and psychological well-being |journal=Social Work |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=158–64 |year=1993 |pmid=8480245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research by Duffy, Gangster, Shaw, Johnson, and Pagon&lt;ref name=duffy/&gt; addressed the fairness theory introduced by Folger and Cropanzano 1998.&lt;ref name=folger1998/&gt; The fairness theory suggests that when individuals face negative situations (such as being undermined by coworkers or supervision) they make cognitive comparisons known as counterfactual thoughts; i.e., they compare what actually happened to what might have been.&lt;ref&gt;Kasimatis, M., &amp; Wells, G. (1995). Individual differences in counter-factual thinking. In N. Roese &amp; J. Olson (Eds.), What might have been: The social psychology of counterfactual thinking (pp. 81–102). New York: Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; The results show that social undermining is closely related to attitudes and behavior regarding one person being or feeling "singled out".

===Envy===
While social undermining can affect a person's behavior and attitude on their job, it can also bring about [[envy]]. Envy can have a positive or negative effect: positive effects include increased performance or attempts at self-improvement. However, envy can have some very harmful effects, including aggression or crime. It can lead to belittling, gossip, withholding information, and giving someone the silent treatment.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Abusive supervision===
{{Main article|Abusive supervision}}
Abusive [[Supervisor|supervision]] can arise in different areas such as in the household, at school, and at a workplace. "Abusive supervision has been investigated as an antecedent to negative subordinate workplace outcome" ;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tepper | first1 = B. J. | year = 2000 | title = Consequences of abusive supervision | url = | journal = Academy of Management Journal | volume = 43 | issue = 2| pages = 178–190 | doi=10.2307/1556375| jstor = 1556375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoobler, J. M., Tepper, B. J., &amp; Duffy, M. K. ( 2000). Moderating effects of coworkers' organizational citizenship behavior on relationships between abusive supervision and subordinates' attitudes and psychological distress. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Southern Management Association, Orlando, FL.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Workplace violence has combination of situational and personal factors" (e.g., Barling, 1996). The study that was conducted looked at the link between abusive supervision and different workplace events. Social undermining can arise from abusive supervision, such as when a supervisor uses negative actions and it leads to "flow downhill";  a supervisor is perceived as abusive.

Research has shown that "abusive supervision is a subjective assessment made by subordinates regarding their supervisors"  behavior towards them over a period of time.&lt;ref name=hoobler&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoobler | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Brass | first2 = D. J. | year = 2006 | title = Abusive supervision and family undermining as displaced aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 91 | issue = 5| pages = 1125–1133 | doi = 10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1125 | pmid=16953773}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, abusive supervision includes a "boss demeaning, belittling, or invading privacy of the subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = S. H. | last2 = John | first2 = O. P. | year = 1997 | title = A hostility scale for the California Psychological Inventory: MMPI, observer Q-sort, and Big-five correlates | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 69 | issue = 2| pages = 408–424 | doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa6902_11| pmid = 9392898 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hostile attribution bias]] is an extra punitive mentality where individuals tend to [[Psychological projection|project]] [[blame]] on others. Researchers wanted to see how hostile attribution bias can moderate the relationship between perceptions of psychological contract violation and subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision. Undermining does arise with abusive supervision, which affects families and aggression; they believe that there is a stronger positive relationship between experiences of psychological contract violation and subordinates' reports of abuse. It suggests that when someone has a negative work environment, it will affect their emotional training ground where this would result in negative home encounters. The findings from this study show that abused subordinates' family members reported a higher incidence of undermining in their home. When this occurs, complications arise at both home and work. Workplace abuse may be spawning negative interpersonal relations in the home, which may contribution to a downward spiral of relationships in both spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andersson | first1 = L. M. | last2 = Pearson | first2 = C. M. | year = 1999 | title = Tit for tat? The spiraling effect of incivility in the workplace | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 452–471 | doi=10.5465/amr.1999.2202131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a subordinate is being abused, it can lead to negative affect towards their family where the subordinate starts undermining their family members. The undermining can arise from displaced aggression which is "redirection of a [person's] harm doing behavior from a primary to a secondary target" (Tedeschi &amp; Norman, 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;30). Family undermining arises from a negative work environment: when someone above you puts you down, one starts to think that one should be put down by one's family members.&lt;ref name=hoobler/&gt;

===Bottom-line mentality===
[[Bottom line]] is defined as profits or losses of a business. Greenbaum and colleagues found that some employees tend to focus on a bottom-line outcome, which may be related to their tendency to engage in social undermining behavior.&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"/&gt; Employees with a bottom line mentality (BLM) tend to focus on only the bottom line, and to neglect other outcomes of their actions, including interpersonal consequences. Research has found that a bottom-line mentality can cause a problem, especially if the employer uses BLM as an objective for them to strive for. If someone is hurt by their actions it is not a priority for those with a BLM.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Employees that have a BLM may learn these actions from their supervisors. BLMs can cause rivalries within the organization since the employee may feel as if the organization should have a winner or loser when it comes to completing work. Employees with this approach think of their work as a game where the winner takes all instead of working with other employees to make sure everyone is contributing to the work that needs to be completed. The competitiveness that is created between the coworkers is to attain bottom-line outcomes. When the employees are trying to attain bottom-line outcomes, with this winner-take-all mentality, they begin to want their co-workers to fail as that consequently means, to them, they, the undermining employee, must be succeeding. The supervisor's BLM causes employee social undermining. This happens because the employees may role-model after the adopted supervisor's BLM. Employee personality also plays a role in the relationship between BLM and undermining. Employees that have confidence in their work ability rely on their work ethic while employees who are low in confidence are more likely to engage in social undermining behavior to make themselves look better when it comes to the bottom line of success.&lt;ref name="Greenbaum"/&gt;

==Individual differences==

Research suggests that whether or not someone engages in [[social support]] or social undermining depends upon their own [[goal]]s. Those with [[compassionate]] goals are more likely to be supportive of others, while those who have more selfish motives believe that people should take care of themselves. When people have goals to preserve their own self-image this can undermine their compassionate goals and make them less supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crocker | first1 = J. | last2 = Canevello | first2 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Creating and undermining social support in communal relationships: The role of compassionate and self-image goals | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 3| pages = 555–575 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.95.3.555 | pmid=18729694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
Research{{which|date=May 2015}} has shown that social undermining can have an effect on a person's health. It has been shown that social undermining can cause depressive symptoms. Depending on the relationship between a patient and their loved one, the loved one can support or undermine the patient and can even do both within the same interaction, which can increase the depressive symptoms. Creating more social support can improve treatment outcomes of a patient depending on the type of stress level the person is enduring.

Research by Joseph et al.&lt;ref name="Joseph, N. T. 2011"/&gt; found that when participants are exposed to high levels of social undermining and even high levels of social support it can improve the participants course of antidepressive treatment. High levels of social support and social undermining could reduce and also cause remission of the participant's depressive symptoms. The study found that African American participants who had low levels of social undermining were able to fare better than the Caucasians participants in reducing their symptoms. When both groups of participants were given high levels of social undermining the African American participants had fewer achievements in symptom reduction, while the Caucasians participants had the reverse effect of symptom reduction.

A 2007 study conducted by Benyamini, Medalion and Garfinkel showed that support from a spouse while being seriously ill helped a person to cope with their illness.&lt;ref name=benyamini&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benyamini | first1 = Y. | last2 = Medalion | first2 = B. | last3 = Garfinkel | first3 = D. | year = 2007 | title = Patient and spouse perceptions of the patient's heart disease and their associations with received and provided social support and undermining | url = | journal = Psychology &amp; Health | volume = 22 | issue = 7| pages = 765–785 | doi=10.1080/14768320601070639}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study used patients who had heart disease. The intention of the study was to find if positive and negative interactions between the patients who have heart disease and their spouse can cause spouse support or spouse undermining. The researchers found that when the patient considered their illness as being negative (e.g., especially painful or likely to be chronic) they tended to want more support from the spouse and tended  to feel as if their spouse was not providing sufficient support. This could cause the patient to believe that they were experiencing social undermining. Other times, the partner's actions could cause the patient to feel as if the spouse was acting critical towards them. This could turn into social undermining, causing the spouse to think that the patient was not taking their condition seriously. When the spouse showed that the illness was serious, it could sometimes cause the spouse to become over-protective of the partner. This could also cause the spouse to be critical of their partner behavior, and the partner could provide less support for the patient. The results of the study were that when a spouse had negative views of the illness, he or she engaged in both more support and more undermining.&lt;ref name=benyamini/&gt;

Research conducted by Horwitz et al. (1998){{full citation needed|date=January 2015}} found that spouse undermining was almost twice as large as the effect for support. For example, a spouse that shows behaviors of withdrawal, avoidance and being overly critical can cause psychological distress in a relationship. This in turn causes stress that increases the depressive symptoms on individuals that have endure high levels of social undermining. This can happen, because the support that a person can get from their spouse compared to a close friend is more exclusive and generally involves more frequent and emotionally intense interactions (Cutrone 1996;{{full citation needed|date=January 2015}} Vinokur &amp; Vinokur &amp; Vinokur- Kaplan, 1990){{full citation needed|date=January 2015}} and depending on their relationship that can influence the social support or even the social undermining that affect the relationship.

Cranford found that spouse undermining and not spouse support can increase depressive symptoms within that relationship. Social undermining has been found to be a stronger indicator for psychological adaption than social support. When there is social undermining in a relationship it can have fatal effects on the spouse's ability to deal with other stressors. It can also lead to an increase of wishful thinking, poor psychological adjustment, maladaptive coping behaviors, and even decrease adaptive coping behaviors. This can give more attention to coping resources and it takes away from other stressors which causes the couple to have fewer chances resolving their problems. If the couple cannot resolve their problems it can cause marital conflict. Social undermining within the relationship can cause negative effects on the spouse physical health and can make the spouse vulnerable to different stressors. This can lead to depressive symptoms that can lessen the spouse self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="citation journal"&gt;{{Cite journal

===Nutrition and exercise===
Research has shown that partners that offer social support can also offer social undermining. An example of this is when family members try to undermine [[parenting styles]] in order to raise healthy children.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} 
Another study found that participants who endure social undermining regarding their eating and exercise behavior,  try to ignore the pressure, and the undermining affects their exercise decisions more than eating decisions.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Market, Stanforth, and Garcia found that social undermining used by family members, friends and coworkers can affect daily activities. Social undermining can affect exercise routines when their exercise routines can conflict with seeing friends or even coworkers. Friends and coworkers can influence the person to skip their exercise, even when a spouse is concerned about their well being. The study also showed that social undermining can affect men and women differently.  Men tend to feel as if they can overcome social undermining because they were still able to make a healthy eating decision. Women have stated that they tend to make bad eating decision when they are eating with other people such as their friends. Social undermining pressures can cause serious challenges when a person is trying to maintain healthy eating and trying to stay active. The study found that people that engage in undermining behavior tend to feel guilty about their own unhealthy behavior and may feel jealous of someone else maintaining their healthy behavior when they cannot achieve the same behavior. The study also suggests when a person is satisfied with their weight it can help the person resist against social undermining. By being satisfied with one's own weight can reduce the likelihood of social undermining in social situations when having dinner with friends. So when a person is not satisfied with their weight they receive more social undermining pressures from the people around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mackert | first1 = M. | last2 = Stanforth | first2 = D. | last3 = Garcia | first3 = A. A. | year = 2011 | title = Undermining of nutrition and exercise decisions: Experiencing negative social influence | url = | journal = Public Health Nursing | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 402–410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===
Social undermining and social support can have opposite effects on a person that can be negative or positive depending on the person or even the relationship. Being in a close relationship can provide a person both social undermining and social support. Example of these relationships can be an abusive relationship that offers low support and high undermining. A typical healthy close relationship has high support and low undermining. In a relationship between an adolescent and a parent, their relationship can offer high levels of support and even undermining. Depending on the relationship, patterns can change over time based on the characteristics and the situation of the relationship. Whether a relationship is positive or negative can have devastating effects.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vinokur | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Van Ryn | first2 = M. | year = 1993 | title = Social support and undermining in close relationships: Their independent effects on the mental health of unemployed persons | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 2| pages = 350–359 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.2.350| citeseerx = 10.1.1.502.7301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social support can give a person coping resources that can reduce threat in a stressful situation. In a relationship if a partner has lower status or even lower power social undermining becomes more of threat for the relationship. Research concludes that social undermining has a greater impact on a person's mental health than social support.

Vinokur and van Ryn used unemployed participants and some of the participants were reemployed to look at the impact that social support and social undermining can have on a person's mental health during economic hardships.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993" /&gt; They suggest that although the support and undermining are inversely and strongly correlated they do not form the same factor but constitute empirically distinct constructs. The study looked at the effect of financial strain, social support, and undermining on poor mental health the results found that it was not statistically significant. Social support and social undermining did have significant but the opposite effect on poor mental health. Vinokur and Ryn(1993)&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993"/&gt;  found that social support and undermining were shown in longitudinal design even when prior levels of mental health and the contribution of another critical stressful factor. Social support and undermining had a dynamic pattern influence on mental health.

The results showed that social support has weak positive effect while social undermining has more volatile effects. Even though the study found that a high level of social undermining has significant effects on mental health when the high levels are reduced there is an improvement in the person mental health over a period of time. In the study participants that received high levels of social undermining even after they return to their normal interactions the participant still returns to high level of undermining that affects the person mental health. These findings were found in relationships for men and women that were either unemployed or reemployed.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993" /&gt;

Another example of how social undermining can affect a person's relationship is shown by a study conducted by McCaskill and Lakey&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCaskill | first1 = J. W. | last2 = Lakey | first2 = B. | year = 2000 | title = Perceived support, social undermining, and emotion: Idiosyncratic and shared perspectives of adolescents and their families | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 26 | issue = 7| pages = 820–832 | doi=10.1177/0146167200269007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which examined social support and social undermining when it came to adolescents and family relationships. Social support and social undermining can reflect different characteristics in the environment that can influence a person's mental health. The study examined how adolescents reported their family support and undermining which reflected shared social reality (that is, all members of the family agree that support or undermining is occurring) and idiosyncratic perception (some family members believe that support or undermining has occurred, but others do not). The results of the study found that girls tend to report higher family stress and negative affect than boys. McCaskill and Lakey (2002)&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000"/&gt; found that adolescents with previous outpatient treatment experience reported both lower family support and higher family stress.

Researchers found that in adolescent self-reports, social undermining was related to negative affect and perceived support was more related to positive affect. The study found that adolescents' idiosyncratic perceptions of family support did predict positive emotion, but shared perceptions of support did not. For social undermining, adolescents' idiosyncratic perceptions, the idiosyncratic perceptions  of the other family members as well as shared social reality that was among family members did predict negative emotion. The study suggest that social support is not based on a shared reality, while social undermining is.&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000" /&gt;

Due to the differences in the scope of the effects of social undermining and social support, many researchers have concluded that they are separate constructs, rather than two ends of a continuum.&lt;ref name="Vinokur, A. D. 1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCaskill, J. W. 2000" /&gt;

==Emotional and behavioral reactions==
Research has found that, depending on how the victim handles social undermining, it can have damaging effects when it comes to increased [[Counterproductive work behavior|counterproductive behaviors]], reciprocated social undermining, and decreased [[job satisfaction]].&lt;ref name="Crossley, C. D. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crossley | first1 = C. D. | year = 2009 | title = Emotional and behavioral reactions to social undermining: A closer look at perceived offender motives | url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=managementfacpub| journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 108 | issue = 1| pages = 14–24 | doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2008.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; These negative outcomes can cause the person to have depression, a decreased [[self-esteem]] and even [[psychosomatic]] symptoms.

In a study of victims' perceptions of undermining they had experienced, Crossley&lt;ref name="Crossley, C. D. 2009" /&gt; found that when an offense was severe, the victim was more likely to believe that the offender committed the action with malicious intent or due to personal greed. Generally, victims' perceptions of the offenders' intentions relate to whether the victim responds to the undermining in a negative fashion with feelings of anger and a desire for revenge, or in a positive fashion with a desire to reconcile with the offender.

[[Posttraumatic embitterment disorder|Post Traumatic Embitterment Disorder]] can be a reaction to this feeling of victimisation.

'''Space weathering''' is the type of weathering that occurs to any object exposed to the harsh environment of [[outer space]].  Bodies without atmospheres (including the [[Moon]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the [[asteroids]], [[comets]], and most of the moons of other planets) take on many weathering processes:
* collisions of [[galactic cosmic ray]]s and [[solar cosmic ray]]s,
* [[irradiation]], implantation, and [[sputtering]] from [[solar wind]] particles, and
* bombardment by different sizes of [[meteorites]] and [[micrometeorites]].
Space weathering is important because these processes affect the physical and [[optical properties]] of the surface of many planetary bodies.  Therefore, it is critical to understand the effects of space weathering in order to properly interpret remotely sensed data.

[[File:Weatheringcartoon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An illustration of space weathering's different components.]]

== History ==

Much of our knowledge of the space weathering process comes from studies of the lunar samples returned by the [[Apollo program]], particularly the [[lunar soil]]s (or [[regolith]]).  The constant flux of [[high energy particles]] and [[micrometeorites]], along with larger meteorites, act to [[Comminution|comminute]], melt, [[sputter]] and [[vaporize]] components of the lunar soil.

The first products of space weathering that were recognized in lunar soils were "agglutinates".  These are created when micrometeorites melt a small amount of material, which incorporates surrounding glass and mineral fragments into a glass-welded aggregate ranging in size from a few micrometers to a few millimeters.  Agglutinates are very common in lunar soil, accounting for as much as 60 to 70% of mature soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heiken|first=Grant|title=Lunar sourcebook : a user's guide to the moon|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-521-33444-0|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These complex and irregularly-shaped particles appear black to the human eye, largely due to the presence of [[Nanophase material|nanophase]] [[iron]].

Space weathering also produces surface-correlated products on individual soil grains, such as glass splashes; implanted [[hydrogen]], [[helium]] and other gases; [[solar flare]] tracks; and accreted components, including nanophase iron.  It wasn't until the 1990s that improved instruments, in particular [[transmission electron microscope]]s, and techniques allowed for the discovery of very thin (60-200&amp;nbsp;nm) [[patina]]s, or rims, which develop on individual lunar soil grains as a result of the redepositing of vapor from nearby micrometeorite impacts and the redeposition of material sputtered from nearby grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|date=June 1997 |title= The nature and origin of rims on lunar soil grains |journal= Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta |volume= 61 |issue= 11 |pages= 2331–2341
|doi=10.1016/S0016-7037(97)00085-9
|bibcode = 1997GeCoA..61.2331K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These weathering processes have large effects on the spectral properties of lunar soil, particularly in the [[ultraviolet]], [[Visible wavelength|visible]], and [[near infrared]] (UV/Vis/NIR) [[wavelengths]]. These spectral changes have largely been attributed to the inclusions of "nanophase iron" which is a ubiquitous component of both agglutinates and soil rims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noble|first=Sarah|author2=Pieters C. M. |author3=Keller L. P. |title=An experimental approach to understanding the optical effects of space weathering|journal=Icarus|date=September 2007|volume=192|pages=629–642|bibcode = 2007Icar..192..629N |doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2007.07.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These very small (one to a few hundred nanometers in diameter) blebs of metallic iron are created when iron-bearing minerals (e.g. [[olivine]] and [[pyroxene]]) are vaporized and the iron is liberated and redeposited in its native form.
[[File:Weatheredrim.jpg|thumb|right|350px|TEM image of space weathered rim on a grain of lunar soil 10084]]

== Effects on spectral properties ==

On the Moon, the spectral effects of space weathering are threefold: as the lunar surface matures it becomes darker (the [[albedo]] is reduced), redder (reflectance increases with increasing wavelength), and the depth of its diagnostic [[absorption band]]s are reduced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pieters |first1= C. M. |last2= Fischer |first2= E. M. |last3= Rode |first3= O. |last4= Basu |first4= A. |date= 1993 |title= Optical Effects of Space Weathering: The Role of the Finest Fraction |journal= Journal of Geophysical Research |volume= 98 |issue= E11 |pages= 20,817–20,824 |doi= 10.1029/93JE02467 |issn= 0148-0227 |bibcode = 1993JGR....9820817P }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These effects are largely due to the presence of [[Nanophase material|nanophase]] iron in both the agglutinates and in the accreted rims on individual grains.  The darkening effects of space weathering are readily seen by studying lunar craters.  Young, fresh craters have bright [[ray system]]s, because they have exposed fresh, unweathered material, but over time those rays disappear as the weathering process darkens the material.

== Space weathering on asteroids ==

Space weathering is also thought to occur on asteroids,&lt;ref&gt;For a thorough review of the current state of understanding of space weathering on Asteroids, see  {{cite journal |last= Chapman |first= Clark R. |date=May 2004 |title= Space Weathering of Asteroid Surfaces |journal= Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume= 32 |pages= 539–567 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.earth.32.101802.120453|bibcode = 2004AREPS..32..539C }}.&lt;/ref&gt; though the environment is quite different from the Moon. Impacts in the asteroid belt are slower, and therefore create less melt and vapor.  Also, fewer solar wind particles reach the asteroid belt.  And finally, the higher rate of impactors and lower gravity of the smaller bodies means that there is more overturn and the surface exposure ages should be younger than the [[lunar surface]].  Therefore, space weathering should occur more slowly and to a lesser degree on the surfaces of asteroids.

However, we do see evidence for asteroidal space weathering.  For years there had been a so-called "conundrum" in the planetary science community because, in general, the spectra of asteroids do not match the spectra of our collection of meteorites. Particularly, the spectra of [[S-type asteroid]]s, did not match the spectra of the most abundant type of meteorites, [[ordinary chondrite]]s (OCs). The asteroid spectra tended to be redder with a steep curvature in the visible wavelengths. However, Binzel et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Binzel |first1= R.P. |last2= Bus |first2= S.J. |last3= Burbine |first3= T.H. |last4= Sunshine |first4= J.M. |date=Aug 1996 |title= Spectral Properties of Near-Earth Asteroids: Evidence for Sources of Ordinary Chondrite Meteorites |journal= Science |volume= 273 |issue= 5277 |pages= 946–948 |doi= 10.1126/science.273.5277.946 |pmid= 8688076|bibcode = 1996Sci...273..946B }}&lt;/ref&gt; have identified near Earth asteroids with spectral properties covering the range from S-type to spectra similar to those of OC meteorites, suggesting an ongoing process is occurring that can alter the spectra of OC material to look like S-type asteroids. There is also evidence of regolith alteration from [[Galileo]]'s flybys of [[951 Gaspra|Gaspra]] and [[243 Ida|Ida]] showing spectral differences at fresh craters. With time, the spectra of Ida and Gaspra appear to redden and lose spectral contrast. Evidence from [[NEAR Shoemaker]]'s x-ray measurements of [[433 Eros|Eros]] indicate an ordinary chondrite composition despite a red-sloped, S-type spectrum, again suggesting that some process has altered the optical properties of the surface. 
Results from the [[Hayabusa]] spacecraft at the asteroid [[25143 Itokawa|Itokawa]], also ordinary chondrite in composition, shows spectral evidence of space weathering.  In addition, definitive evidence of space weathering alteration has been identified in the grains of soil returned by the Hayabusa spacecraft.  Because Itokawa is so small (550 m diameter), it was thought that the low gravity would not allow for the development of a mature regolith, however, preliminary examination of the returned samples reveals the presence of nanophase iron and other space weathering effects on several grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=8|author=T. Noguchi|author2=T. Nakamura|author3=M. Kimura|author4=M. E. Zolensky|author5=M. Tanaka|author6=T. Hashimoto|author7=M. Konno|author8=A. Nakato|author9=T. Ogami|author10=A. Fujimura|author11=M.

Such coatings are likely similar to the patinas found on lunar rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hiroi|first=Takahiro|author2=Abe M. |author3=K. Kitazato |author4=S. Abe |author5=B. Clark |author6=S. Sasaki |author7= M. Ishiguro |author8= O.

There is evidence to suggest most of the color change due to weathering occurs rapidly, in the first hundred thousands years, limiting the usefulness of spectral measurement for determining the age of asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sun damage conceals asteroids' true ages |author=Rachel Courtland |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=30 April 2009 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17062-sun-damage-conceals-asteroids-true-ages.html |accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Space weathering on Mercury ==

The environment at [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] also differs substantially from the Moon.  For one thing, it is significantly hotter in the day ([[Diurnal cycle|diurnal]] surface temperature ~100&amp;nbsp;°C for the Moon, ~425&amp;nbsp;°C on Mercury) and colder at night, which may alter the products of space weathering. In addition, because of its location in the Solar System, Mercury is also subjected to a slightly larger flux of micrometeorites that impact at much higher velocities than the Moon. These factors combine to make Mercury much more efficient than the Moon at creating both melt and vapor.  Per unit area, impacts on Mercury are expected to produce 13.5x the melt and 19.5x the vapor than is produced on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cintala |first= Mark J. |date=Jan 1992 |title= Impact-Induced Thermal Effects in the Lunar and Mercurian Regoliths |journal= Journal of Geophysical Research |volume= 97 |issue= E1 |pages= 947–973 |issn= 0148-0227 |doi= 10.1029/91JE02207|bibcode = 1992JGR....97..947C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Agglutinitic glass-like deposits and vapor-deposited coatings should be created significantly faster and more efficiently on Mercury than on the Moon.

The UV/Vis spectrum of Mercury, as observed telescopically from Earth, is roughly linear, with a red slope.  There are no absorption bands related to Fe-bearing minerals, such as pyroxene.  This means that either there is no iron on the surface of Mercury, or else the iron in the Fe-bearing minerals has been weathered to nanophase iron.  A weathered surface would then explain the reddened slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hapke |first= Bruce |date=Feb 2001 |title= Space Weathering from Mercury to the asteroid belt |journal= Journal of Geophysical Research |volume= 106 |issue= E5 |pages= 10,039–10,073 |doi= 10.1029/2000JE001338|bibcode = 2001JGR...10610039H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spherical roller thrust bearing''' is a [[rolling-element bearing]] of [[Thrust bearing|thrust type]] that permits rotation with low friction, and permits angular misalignment. The bearing is designed to take radial loads, and heavy axial loads in one direction. Typically these bearings support a rotating shaft in the bore of the shaft washer that may be misaligned in respect to the housing washer. The misalignment is possible due to the spherical internal shape of the house washer.&lt;ref name=misalignment&gt;{{cite web|title=Misalignment|url=http://www.skf.com/us/products/bearings-units-housings/roller-bearings/spherical-roller-bearings/misalignment/index.html|publisher=SKF|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Spherical roller thrust bearings constitute of a shaft washer (for radial bearings often called "inner ring"), a housing washer (for radial bearings often called "outer ring"), asymmetrical rollers and a cage.&lt;ref name="SKF SRTB"&gt;{{cite book|title=SKF Spherical roller thrust bearings|year=2010|publisher=SKF|url=http://www.skf.com/binary/12-121034/06104_1-EN.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also bearing units available that can take axial loads in two directions.

==History==
The spherical roller thrust bearing was introduced by [[SKF]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early history|url=http://www.skf.com/group/our-company/skf-history/index.html|publisher=SKF|accessdate=17 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116060342/http://www.skf.com/group/our-company/skf-history/index.html|archivedate=16 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the early bearings is similar to the design that is still in use in modern machines.

==Designs==
[[File:Schema Roller thrust bearing, self-aligning.svg|thumb|Section view of a spherical roller thrust bearing]]

The internal design of the bearing is not standardised by ISO, so it varies between different manufacturers and different series. Some of the design parameters are:
* Roller shape and dimensions
* Flange design
* Non-rotational notches in house washer

The spherical roller thrust bearings have the highest load rating density of all thrust bearings.&lt;ref name=WhySRTB&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Spherical roller thrust bearings|url=http://www.skf.com/binary/12-101526/Why-SKF-sheet-for-SRTB---6548_EN.pdf|work=6548/1|publisher=SKF|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dimensions==
External dimensions of spherical roller bearings are standardised by [[ISO]] in the standard ISO 104:2002.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dimensions|url=http://www.skf.com/group/products/bearings-units-housings/ball-bearings/principles/bearing-data-general/dimensions/index.html|publisher=SKF|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some common series of spherical roller bearings are:
* 292
* 293
* 294

==Materials==
Bearing rings and rolling elements can be made of a number of different materials, but the most common is "chrome steel", a material with approximately 1.5% chrome content. Such "chrome steel" has been standardized by a number of authorities, and there are therefore a number of similar materials, such as: AISI 52100 (USA), 100CR6 (Germany), SUJ2 (Japan) and GCR15 (China).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bearing materials|url=http://www.astbearings.com/bearing-materials.html|publisher=AST Bearings|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common materials for bearing cages:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cage materials|url=http://www.skf.com/group/products/bearings-units-housings/roller-bearings/principles/bearing-data-general/materials-for-rolling-bearings/cage-materials/index.html|publisher=SKF|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sheet steel]] (stamped or laser-cut)
* [[Brass]] (stamped or machined)
* [[Steel]] (machined)

The choice of material is mainly done by the manufacturing volume and method. For large-volume bearings, cages are often of stamped sheet-metal, whereas low volume series often have cages of machined brass or machined steel.

==Manufacturers==
Some manufacturers of ''spherical roller bearings'' are [[SKF]], [[Schaeffler]], [[Timken Company]] and [[NSK Ltd.]].

==Applications==
Spherical roller thrust bearings are used in industrial applications, where there are heavy axial loads, moderate speeds and possibly misalignment.
Some common application areas are:&lt;ref name=WhySRTB /&gt;

* [[Transmission (mechanics)|Gearboxes]]
* [[Pulp and paper]] processing equipment (notably refiners)
* [[Marine propulsion]] and [[offshore drilling]]
* [[Crane (machine)|Cranes]] and [[swing bridge]]s
* [[Water turbine]]s
* [[Plastics extrusion|Extruders]] for injection molding

The '''Staten Island Bluebelt''' (also known simply as '''Bluebelt'''), is a large scale system of stormwater [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMPs) that have been under construction on [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], since the early 1990s. The Bluebelt includes structural and nonstructural [[stormwater]] management control measures taken to mitigate changes to both quantity and quality of [[surface runoff|runoff]] caused through changes to land use.

The Bluebelt program was initiated in the late 1980s by New York City’s [[New York City Department of Environmental Protection|Departments of Environmental Protection]] and [[New York City Department of City Planning|Department of City Planning]], based on a suggestion made several decades earlier by [[Ian McHarg]], a [[landscape architect]].&lt;ref name=unbound&gt;{{cite unbound|pages=319-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acquisition of land began in 1991 for the project,&lt;ref name=unbound /&gt; one of the Northeast United States’ most ambitious stormwater management efforts.  The overall goal is to provide the necessary stormwater drainage infrastructure for a {{convert|12000|acre|km2|adj=on}} region on the southern end of the island while at the same time preserving the last great stand of freshwater wetlands in New York City. The bluebelt uses a series of carefully placed BMPs at the storm sewer/wetland interface to reduce flooding and improve water quality. Creation of a self-regulating ecosystem that is native to the Staten Island region is of primary importance to the program.

BMPs used in the bluebelt include stormwater wetlands, stream restoration, outlet stilling basins, and sand filters. Ninety-two stormwater wetlands are planned for the project, about half of which have been constructed to date (2008). In order to integrate the wetlands into the natural ecology, the construction process is advised by restoration specialists since general contractors are typically not trained in proper plant selection and installation. The planting design focuses on quick establishment of the preferred successional communities that will complement the surrounding landscape, before invasive species take over the site.

The performance of the Bluebelt during the storms that battered Staten Island in the early 21st century &amp;ndash; including [[Hurricane Sandy]] &amp;ndash; has been described as "brilliant".&lt;ref name=unbound /&gt;

{{unreferenced|date=June 2012}}
A '''swing-door operator''' (or '''swing-door opener''' or '''automatic swing-door operator''') is a device that operates a [[swing door]] for pedestrian use. It opens or helps open the door automatically, waits, then closes it.

== Types ==
There are 3 basic types of swing door operators:
* Full Energy – It opens and closes the door at full speed.
* Low Energy – It opens and closes the door at reduced speed to limit the kinetic energy of the moving door to levels deemed safe for disabled users.
* Power Assist – This is a version of the low-energy operator. It doesn't open the door; instead, it lets the user open the door manually at a reduced force, compared to opening against a standard [[door closer]]. It closes the door with the same speed limitations as a low-energy operator.

== Uses ==
Full Energy operators are typically used on the outside doors of medium-sized retail business. (Larger retail businesses prefer [[sliding door operator]]s.)
Low Energy operators are typically used where a simple door closer is sufficient for able users, yet it is necessary to add access to disabled users: small businesses, apartments, bathrooms.

== Triggering ==
A door operator may be triggered in various ways:
* Approach sensor (such as a radar sensor in the form of a [[Gunn diode]] and [[Waveguide]]) – the door opens when a user approaches it.
* Pushbutton – the door opens when a user presses a button.
* Push-&amp;-go – the door opens fully when the user begins opening it.
* Access control – the door opens when an [[access control|access control system]] determines the user is authorized to go through.
A trigger from any of the above requests that the door be opened (or reopened if it was closing). The operator will heed hat requests only after it is able to do so safely for any other users in the area.

== Safety sensors ==
A door operator may use sensors to prevent the door from coming into contact with a user.

Full Energy operators require at least 3 sensors. Low-energy operators are not required to have safety sensors, as the door is allowed to come in contact with a user, given that the kinetic energy of the moving door is limited by the reduced moving speed.

Historically, sensors have been simply floor mats that sense the weight of a user, one in the area immediately in front of the door (the approach side) and one in the area behind it (the swing side). The approach side mat is often used as a trigger sensor. The swing side mat prevents the door from starting to open as long as some other person is detected in the swing area; once the door starts opening, this mat is ignored, as it will sense the user going through.

Today, [[infrared safety sensor]]s or [[laser safety sensor]] are normally used. Four types are commonly used.
*Header mounted presence sensor – Mounted on the jamb above the door, on the approach side, it detects the presence of a person standing in front of the door.
*Approach side, door mounted sensor – Mounted on the approach side of the door itself, used as the door is closing to detect a user in the way of the closing door. Some safety sensor also safeguard the hinge area to protect hands and fingers during the closing process. In that case, the operator either stops the door or reopens it.
*Swing side, door mounted sensor – Mounted on the swing side of the door itself, used as the door is opening to detect a user in the way of the opening door. In that case, the operator stops the door. The sensitivity of infrared sensors must be reduced at the end of the opening angle, if it starts seeing a wall next to the door, so it may not confuse it with a user. Laser based sensors increase the safety by learning the surroundings of the door and dynamically adapt their detection fields to only ignore the wall next to the door.
*Safety beam – This beam crosses the path of the user past the swing side. If interrupted, the operator assumes that a person has crossed into the swing area, and it is not safe to open the door at full speed. This sensor is ignored once the door has started to open, as then the operator assumes that it is the user having gone through the door that has interrupted the beam.

[[File:Swing door.jpg|thumb|Typical swing door with a laser safety sensor]]

== Opening technologies ==
The majority of the operators open the door directly or through an arm.
* Overhead concealed mount – the operator is mounted above the door and rotates the door directly, through its pivot.
* Surface mount, push (scissor arm) – the operator is mounted on the wall above the door, on the approach side and pushes the door with a linkage of 2 arms.
* Surface mount, pull (track) – the operator is mounted on the wall above the door, on the swing side and pulls the door with an arm whose end slides in a track mounted on the door.

Variations on the above exist.
There are also rare operators that use a mechanism that is disconnected from the door, and reaches out and pushes on the door itself when it needs to open it.

== Internal technologies ==
Operators are powered by an [[electric motor]]. They differ in how they use the motor's energy to open the door.

[[Image:Swing door operator animation.gif|frame|right|Disengaging, closer-based, push-mount, electro-mechanical operator. View from above. Shades of blue: standard door closer. Shades of red: opener gears. Gold: motor.]]
Operators use various internal technologies.
* Some are built on top of a standard door closer. To open the door, the operator forces the closer in the opening direction. Then, the closer closes the door. The user may open the door manually, using just the door closer. In case of power failure while the door is open, the closer itself closes the door.
* Some are built without a door closer. The motor opens and closes the door through reducing [[gear]]s. The operator may or may not include a return [[Spring (device)|spring]] to close the door in case of power failure while the door is open.
Operators are often categorized by the means by which the motor's energy is applied.
* Electromechanical – the motor uses purely mechanical means to open the door: gears, cams, levers and such. This is the preferred type in the US.
* Electro-hydraulic – the motor drives a hydraulic pump, which pressurizes the oil in a door closer, which in turn turns the door closer and opens the door. This is the preferred type in Europe. (In the US it has a reputation of being prone to oil leaks.)
* Electro-pneumatic – the motor drives an air compressor and may be located away from the door. The air pressure is used to drive the operator above the door. This type is not common, and noise can be a factor if compressor is located close to a door. Typically, the compressor can be located up to 200 feet away ensuring that noise is not a factor.  A typical life expectancy of a pneaumtic system is 10–15 years except the compressor. Best application of a pneumatic system is in a residential environment where usage is limited to 30–40 times a day.

Of the electromechanical types, two approaches are used:
*Disengaging – the motor driven mechanism (the opener portion) is not joined to the closer, but only engages the closer when it is needed to open the door. When opening the door manually, the opener portion is still, so the opening is smooth and quiet.
*Permanently engaged – the motor driven mechanism (the opener portion) is always joined to the closer (if present) and to the door. When opening the door manually, the user is also driving the opener portion, so the opening is rough and noisy.
Electro-hydraulic types are inherently quiet and smooth during manual opening, as the motor and pump are off.

[[File:voltage clamp.svg|thumb|277px|right|The '''voltage clamp''' operates by [[negative feedback]]. The membrane potential [[differential amplifier|amplifier]] measures membrane voltage and sends output to the feedback amplifier; this subtracts the membrane voltage from the command voltage, which it receives from the signal generator. This signal is amplified and output is sent into the [[axon]] via the current electrode.]]
{{Portal|Neuroscience}}
The '''voltage clamp''' is an experimental method used by [[electrophysiology|electrophysiologists]] to measure the [[ion]] [[electrical current|currents]] through the [[cell membrane|membranes]] of excitable cells, such as [[neuron]]s, while holding the membrane [[voltage]] at a set level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4614-7320-6_137-2|title=Encyclopedia of Computational Neuroscience|last=Nowotny|first=Dr Thomas|last2=Levi|first2=Dr Rafael|date=2014|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=9781461473206|editor-last=Jaeger|editor-first=Dieter|pages=1–5|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7320-6_137-2|editor-last2=Jung|editor-first2=Ranu}}&lt;/ref&gt; A basic voltage clamp will iteratively measure the [[membrane potential]], and then change the membrane potential (voltage) to a desired value by adding the necessary current. This "clamps" the cell membrane at a desired constant voltage, allowing the voltage clamp to record what currents are delivered. Because the currents applied to the cell must be equal to (and opposite in [[electric charge|charge]] to) the current going across the cell membrane at the set voltage, the recorded currents indicate how the cell reacts to changes in membrane potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hernandez-Ochoa | first1 = E.

==History==

The concept of the voltage clamp is attributed to [[Kenneth Cole (electrophysiologist)|Kenneth Cole]]&lt;ref name=Neuroscience&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Bear |editor1-first=Mark F. |editor2-last=Connors |editor2-first=Barry W. |editor3-last=Michael A. |title=Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain |origyear=1996 |edition=3rd |year=2006 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia, Baltimore |isbn=978-0-7817-6003-4 |id={{LCC|QP355.2.B42}} |page=84 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75NgwLzueikC&amp;pg=PA84}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Marmont]]&lt;ref name="duke"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://neuron.duke.edu/userman/2/pioneer.html |chapter=A Brief history of Computational Neuroscience |publisher=Duke University |first1=John W. |last1=Moore |first2=Michael L. |last2=Hines |year=1994 |title=Simulations with NEURON}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the spring of 1947.&lt;ref name="Andrew Huxley 1996"&gt;Andrew Huxley, 1996, "Kenneth Sterward Cole 1900 – 1984, A biographical Memoir" National Academy of Sciences. (Washington D.C.)&lt;/ref&gt; They inserted an internal electrode into the giant axon of a squid and began to apply a current. Cole discovered that it was possible to use two [[electrode]]s and a [[feedback circuit]] to keep the [[cell (biology)|cell's]] [[membrane potential]] at a level set by the experimenter.

Cole developed the voltage clamp technique before the era of [[microelectrode]]s, so his two electrodes consisted of fine wires twisted around an [[electrical insulation|insulating]] rod. Because this type of electrode could be inserted into only the largest cells, early electrophysiological experiments were conducted almost exclusively on [[squid]] axons.

[[File:Authorized Kenneth Cole Picture.jpg|thumb|middle|A personal photo of Kenneth Cole, given to Dr. J. Walter Woodbury]]

Squids squirt jets of water when they need to move quickly, as when escaping a predator. To make this escape as fast as possible, they have an [[axon]] that can reach 1&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter (signals propagate more quickly down large axons). The [[squid giant axon]] was the first preparation that could be used to voltage clamp a transmembrane current, and it was the basis of Hodgkin and Huxley's pioneering experiments on the properties of the action potential.&lt;ref name="Andrew Huxley 1996"/&gt;

[[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Alan Hodgkin]] realized that, to understand ion flux across the membrane, it was necessary to eliminate differences in membrane potential.&lt;ref name=Huxley&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(02)02280-4 |title=From overshoot to voltage clamp |year=2002 |last1=Huxley |first1=Andrew |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=25 |issue=11 |pages=553–8 |pmid=12392929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using experiments with the voltage clamp, Hodgkin and [[Andrew Huxley]] published 5 papers in the summer of 1952 describing how ionic currents give rise to the [[action potential]].&lt;ref&gt;Vandenberg, J. I. and S. G. Waxman (2012). "Hodgkin and Huxley and the basis for electrical signalling: a remarkable legacy still going strong." J. Physiol. (Oxford, U. K.) 590(11): 2569–2570.&lt;/ref&gt; The final paper proposed the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] which mathematically describes the action potential. The use of voltage clamps in their experiments to study and model the action potential in detail has laid the foundation for [[electrophysiology]]; for which they shared the 1963 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].&lt;ref name=Huxley/&gt;

==Technique==
The voltage clamp is a current generator. [[Transmembrane voltage]] is recorded through a "voltage electrode", relative to [[electrical ground|ground]], and a "current electrode" passes current into the cell. The experimenter sets a "holding voltage", or "command potential", and the voltage clamp uses negative feedback to maintain the cell at this voltage. The electrodes are connected to an amplifier, which measures membrane potential and feeds the signal into a [[feedback amplifier]]. This amplifier also gets an input from the signal generator that determines the command potential, and it subtracts the membrane potential from the command potential (V&lt;sub&gt;command&lt;/sub&gt; – V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;), magnifies any difference, and sends an output to the current electrode. Whenever the cell deviates from the holding voltage, the [[operational amplifier]] generates an "error signal", that is the difference between the command potential and the actual voltage of the cell. The [[feedback circuit]] passes current into the cell to reduce the error signal to zero. Thus, the clamp circuit produces a current equal and opposite to the ionic current.

==Variations of the voltage clamp technique==

=== Two-electrode voltage clamp using microelectrodes ===
[[File:tevcimage.jpg|thumb|Two-electrode voltage clamp]]
The two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) technique is used to study properties of membrane proteins, especially ion channels.&lt;ref name=Guan&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/978-1-62703-351-0_6 |title=Two-electrode voltage clamp |year=2013 |last1=Guan |first1=B. |last2=Chen |first2=X. |last3=Zhang |first3=H. |journal=Methods in Molecular Biology |volume=998 |pages=79–89 |pmid=23529422}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers use this method most commonly to investigate membrane structures expressed  in [[Xenopus laevis|''Xenopus'']] [[oocyte]]s. The large size of these oocytes allows for easy handling and manipulability.&lt;ref name=Polder&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0165-0270(01)00385-5 |title=The use of control theory for the design of voltage clamp systems: a simple and standardized procedure for evaluating system parameters |year=2001 |last1=Polder |first1=H.R. |last2=Swandulla |first2=D. |journal=Journal of Neuroscience Methods |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=97–109 |pmid=11513944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TEVC method utilizes two low-resistance pipettes, one sensing voltage and the other injecting current. The microelectrodes are filled with conductive solution and inserted into the cell to artificially control membrane potential. The membrane acts as a [[dielectric]] as well as a [[resistor]], while the fluids on either side of the membrane function as [[capacitor]]s.&lt;ref name=Polder/&gt; The microelectrodes compare the membrane potential against a command voltage, giving an accurate reproduction of the currents flowing across the membrane. Current readings can be used to analyze the electrical response of the cell to different applications.

This technique is favored over single-microelectrode clamp or other voltage clamp techniques when conditions call for resolving large currents. The high current-passing capacity of the two-electrode clamp makes it possible to clamp large currents that are impossible to control with single-electrode [[patch clamp|patch techniques]].&lt;ref name=DiFranco&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1085/jgp.201010496 |title=Chloride currents from the transverse tubular system in adult mammalian skeletal muscle fibers |year=2011 |last1=DiFranco |first1=M. |last2=Herrera |first2=A. |last3=Vergara |first3=J.L. |journal=The Journal of General Physiology |volume=137 |issue=1 |pages=21–41 |pmid=21149546 |pmc=3010054}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-electrode system is also desirable for its fast clamp settling time and low noise. However, TEVC is limited in use with regard to cell size. It is effective in larger-diameter oocytes, but more difficult to use with small cells. Additionally, TEVC method is limited in that the transmitter of current must be contained in the pipette. It is not possible to manipulate the intracellular fluid while clamping, which is possible using patch clamp techniques.&lt;ref name=Hernandez-Ochoa&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.01.001 |title=Voltage clamp methods for the study of membrane currents and SR Ca(2+) release in adult skeletal muscle fibres |year=2012 |last1=Hernandez-Ochoa |first1=E. |last2=Schneider |first2=M. |journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=98–118 |pmid=22306655 |pmc=3321118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another disadvantage involves "space clamp" issues. [[Kenneth Cole (electrophysiologist)|Cole's]] voltage clamp used a long wire that clamped the squid axon uniformly along its entire length. TEVC microelectrodes can provide only a spatial [[point source]] of current that may not uniformly affect all parts of an irregularly shaped cell.

The dual-cell voltage clamp technique is a specialized variation of the two electrode voltage clamp, and is only used in the study of [[gap junction]] channels.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9560458 |year=1998 |last1=Van Rijen |first1=H.

When two cells in which gap junction proteins are expressed either endogenously or via injection of [[mRNA]], a junction channel will form between the cells. Since two cells are present in the system, two sets of electrodes are used. A recording electrode and a current injecting electrode are inserted into each cell, and each cell is clamped individually (each set of electrodes is attached to a separate apparatus, and integration of data is performed by computer). To record junctional [[electrical resistance and conductance|conductance]], the current is varied in the first cell while the recording electrode in the second cell records any changes in V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; for the second cell only. (The process can be reversed with the stimulus occurring in the second cell and recording occurring in the first cell.) Since no variation in current is being induced by the electrode in the recorded cell, any change in voltage must be induced by current crossing into the recorded cell, through the gap junction channels, from the cell in which the current was varied.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

=== Single-electrode voltage clamp ===
This category describes a set of techniques in which one electrode is used for voltage clamp. Continuous single-electrode clamp (SEVC-c) technique is often used with patch-clamp recording. Discontinuous single-electrode voltage-clamp (SEVC-d) technique is used with penetrating intracellular recording. This single electrode carries out the functions of both current injection and voltage recording.

{{Main|patch clamp}}
The "patch-clamp" technique allows the study of individual ion channels. It uses an electrode with a relatively large tip (&gt; 1 micrometer) that has a smooth surface (rather than a sharp tip). This is a "patch-clamp electrode" (as distinct from a "sharp electrode" used to impale cells). This electrode is pressed against a cell membrane and suction is applied to pull the cell's membrane inside the electrode tip. The suction causes the cell to form a tight seal with the electrode (a "gigaohm seal", as the resistance is more than a [[ohm (unit)|gigaohm]]).

SEV-c has the advantage that you can record from small cells that would be impossible to impale with two electrodes. However:
#Microelectrodes are imperfect conductors; in general, they have a resistance of more than a million [[Ohm (unit)|ohms]]. They rectify (i.e., change their resistance with voltage, often in an irregular manner), they sometimes have unstable resistance if clogged by cell contents. Thus, they will not faithfully record the voltage of the cell, especially when it is changing quickly, nor will they faithfully pass current.
#Voltage and current errors: SEV-c circuitry does not actually measure the voltage of the cell being clamped (as does a two-electrode clamp). The patch-clamp amplifier is like a two-electrode clamp, except the voltage measuring and current passing circuits are connected (in the two-electrode clamp, they are connected ''through the cell''). The electrode is attached to a wire that contacts the current/voltage loop inside the amplifier. Thus, the electrode has only an indirect influence on the feedback circuit. The amplifier reads only the voltage at the top of the electrode, and feeds back current to compensate. But, if the electrode is an imperfect conductor, the clamp circuity has only a distorted view of the membrane potential. Likewise, when the circuit passes back current to compensate for that (distorted) voltage, the current will be distorted by the electrode before it reaches the cell. To compensate for this, the electrophysiologist uses the lowest resistance electrode possible, makes sure that the electrode characteristics do not change during an experiment (so the errors will be constant), and avoids recording currents with kinetics likely to be too fast for the clamp to follow accurately. The accuracy of SEV-c goes up the slower and smaller are the voltage changes it is trying to clamp.
#Series resistance errors: The currents passed to the cell must go to ground to complete the circuit. The voltages are recorded by the amplifier relative to ground. When a cell is clamped at its natural [[resting potential]], there is no problem; the clamp is not passing current and the voltage is being generated only by the cell. But, when clamping at a different potential, series resistance errors become a concern; the cell will pass current across its membrane in an attempt to return to its natural resting potential. The clamp amplifier opposes this by passing current to maintain the holding potential. A problem arises because the electrode is between the amplifier and the cell; i.e., the electrode is ''in series'' with the resistor that is the cell's membrane. Thus, when passing current through the electrode and the cell, [[Ohm's Law]] tells us that this will cause a voltage to form across both the cell's and the electrode's resistance. As these resistors are in series, the voltage drops will add. If the electrode and the cell membrane have equal resistances (which they usually do not), and if the experimenter command a 40mV change from the resting potential, the amplifier will pass enough current until it reads that it has achieved that 40mV change. However, in this example, half of that voltage drop is across the electrode. The experimenter thinks he or she has moved the cell voltage by 40 mV, but has moved it only by 20 mV. The difference is the "series resistance error". Modern patch-clamp amplifiers have circuity to compensate for this error, but these compensate only 70-80% of it. The electrophysiologist can further reduce the error by recording at or near the cell's natural resting potential, and by using as low a resistance electrode as possible.
#Capacitance errors. Microelectrodes are capacitors, and are particularly troublesome because they are non-linear. The capacitance arises because the electrolyte inside the electrode is separated by an insulator (glass) from the solution outside. This is, by definition and function, a capacitor. Worse, as the thickness of the glass changes the farther you get from the tip, the [[time constant]] of the capacitor will vary. This produces a distorted record of membrane voltage or current whenever they are changing. Amplifiers can compensate for this, but not entirely because the capacitance has many time-constants. The experimenter can reduce the problem by keeping the cell's bathing solution shallow (exposing less glass surface to liquid) and by coating the electrode with silicone, resin, paint, or another substance that will increase the distance between the inside and outside solutions.
#Space clamp errors. A single electrode is a point source of current. In distant parts of the cell, the current passed through the electrode will be less influential than at nearby parts of the cell. This is particularly a problem when recording from neurons with elaborate dendritic structures. There is nothing one can do about space clamp errors except to temper the conclusions of the experiment.

==== Discontinuous single-electrode voltage-clamp (SEVC-d) ====
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
A single-electrode voltage clamp &amp;mdash; discontinuous, or SEVC-d, has some advantages over SEVC-c for whole-cell recording. In this, a different approach is taken for passing current and recording voltage. A SEVC-d amplifier operates on a "[[time-sharing]]" basis, so the electrode regularly and frequently switches between passing current and measuring voltage. In effect, there are two electrodes, but each is in operation for only half of the time it is on. The oscillation between the two functions of the single electrode is termed a duty cycle. During each cycle, the amplifier measures the membrane potential and compares it with the holding potential. An [[operational amplifier]] measures the difference, and generates an error signal. This current is a mirror image of the current generated by the cell. The amplifier outputs feature [[sample and hold]] circuits, so each briefly sampled voltage is then held on the output until the next measurement in the next cycle. To be specific, the amplifier measures voltage in the first few microseconds of the cycle, generates the error signal, and spends the rest of the cycle passing current to reduce that error. At the start of the next cycle, voltage is measured again, a new error signal generated, current passed etc. The experimenter sets the cycle length, and it is possible to sample with periods as low as about 15 microseconds, corresponding to a 67&amp;nbsp;kHz switching frequency. Switching frequencies lower than about 10&amp;nbsp;kHz are not sufficient when working with action potentials that are less than 1 millisecond wide. Note that not all discontinuous voltage-clamp amplifier support switching frequencies higher than 10&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=Polder2001&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0165-0270(01)00385-5 |title=The use of control theory for the design of voltage clamp systems: a simple and standardized procedure for evaluating system parameters |year=2001 |last1=Polder |first1=H.

For this to work, the cell capacitance must be higher than the electrode capacitance by at least an [[order of magnitude]]. Capacitance slows the kinetics (the rise and fall times) of currents. If the electrode capacitance is much less than that of the cell, then when current is passed through the electrode, the electrode voltage will change faster than the cell voltage. Thus, when current is injected and then turned off (at the end of a duty cycle), the electrode voltage will decay faster than the cell voltage. As soon as the electrode voltage asymptotes to the cell voltage, the voltage can be sampled (again) and the next amount of charge applied. Thus, the frequency of the duty cycle is limited to the speed at which the electrode voltage rises and decays while passing current. The lower the electrode capacitance the faster one can cycle.

SEVC-d has a major advantage over SEVC-c in allowing the experimenter to measure membrane potential, and, as it obviates passing current and measuring voltage at the same time, there is never a series resistance error. The main disadvantages are that the time resolution is limited and the amplifier is unstable. If it passes too much current, so that the goal voltage is over-shot, it reverses the polarity of the current in the next duty cycle. This causes it to undershoot the target voltage, so the next cycle reverses the polarity of the injected current again. This error can grow with each cycle until the amplifier oscillates out of control (“ringing”); this usually results in the destruction of the cell being recorded. The investigator wants a short duty cycle to improve temporal resolution; the amplifier has adjustable compensators that will make the electrode voltage decay faster, but, if these are set too high the amplifier will ring, so the investigator is always trying to “tune” the amplifier as close to the edge of uncontrolled oscillation as possible, in which case small changes in recording conditions can cause ringing. There are two solutions: to “back off” the amplifier settings into a safe range, or to be alert for signs that the amplifier is about to ring.
