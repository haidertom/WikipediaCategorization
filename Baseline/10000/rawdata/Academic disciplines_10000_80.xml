'''ARGOS''' is a [[Decision support system|Decision Support System (DSS)]] for [[Crisis Management|crisis]] and [[emergency management]] for incidents with chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear ([[CBRN]]) releases.

== The ARGOS system ==
In case of incidents with chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear releases, ARGOS can be used to get an overview of the situation, create a prognosis of how the situation will evolve, and calculate the consequences of the incidents. The target is accidents, as well as terrorist initiated events related to CBRN industries, transports of hazardous materials, and others.

ARGOS improves [[situation awareness]], facilitates decision support, and information sharing among the emergency response organizations. As a simulation instrument, ARGOS is also valuable for training of response organizations, and for providing information to the public.

The ARGOS system makes intensive use of [[geographic information system]] (GIS) to display data on geographic maps. Colours are used to express the concentration, contamination, time-of-arrival, trajectories, doses or inhalation, and ISO curves can display important threshold levels. The GIS system can display NPP’s – measuring stations and weather conditions like precipitation and wind fields.

For running short range prognoses, ARGOS can download a [[numerical weather prediction]] from the Met-Office in the country. As the main [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion model]], ARGOS includes the [[RIMPUFF]] model from [[Risø National Laboratory]].

== The ARGOS User Group ==
The current member countries of the ARGOS User Group are (January 2017): [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[Japan]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Singapore]], [[Sweden]], [[Ukraine]] and [[United Kingdom]].

The ARGOS User Group has the objective of maintaining and further evolve ARGOS as a state-of-the-art decision support system for emergency response, as well as a network of expertise. The ARGOS User Group  arranges bi-annual meetings where all members have equal opportunities to influence the development of the system. The ARGOS User Group discusses experiences with ARGOS and decides which new facilities to develop, which new models to include, among others.

==ARGOS history==
The original development of ARGOS started in 1992 by the [[Danish Emergency Management Agency]] and Prolog Development Center,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdc.dk/argos PDC]&lt;/ref&gt; in close cooperation with [[Risø National Laboratory]] and the [[Danish Meteorological Institute]].

{{Reading}}
According to the '''alphabetic principle''', [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s and combinations of letters are the [[symbol]]s used to represent the [[phoneme|speech sounds]] of a language based on systematic and predictable relationships between written letters, symbols, and spoken words. The alphabetic principle is the foundation of any alphabetic writing system (such as the [[English (language)|English]] variety of the [[Roman alphabet]]), which is one of the more common types of [[List of writing systems|writing systems]] in use today.

Alphabetic writing systems that use an (in practice) almost perfectly [[phonemic orthography]] have a single letter for each individual speech sound and a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and the letters that represent them. Such systems are used, for example, in the modern languages [[Serbian language|Serbian]] (arguably, an example of perfect phonemic orthography), [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. Such languages have a straightforward [[spelling]] system, enabling a writer to predict the spelling of a word given its [[pronunciation]] and similarly enabling a reader to predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling. Ancient languages with such almost perfectly phonemic writing systems include [[Avestan alphabet|Avestic]], [[Latin]], [[Tamil script|Tamil]], [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]], and [[Sanskrit]] ([[Devanāgarī]]— an [[abugida]]; see [[Vyakarana]]). On the other hand, [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] have a strong difference between sounds and symbols.

The alphabetic principle does not underlie [[logogram|logographic writing systems]] like [[written Chinese|Chinese]] or [[syllabary|syllabic writing systems]] such as [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kana]]. [[Korean Language|Korean]], along with Chinese and Japanese, is a member of the [[CJK characters|CJK group]] and shares origins for many of the symbols. [[Hangul]], the Korean writing system, is actually strongly alphabetic while it may look logographic or syllabic to outsiders.

==Latin alphabet==
{{Main|Latin alphabet}}
Most [[orthographies]] that use the [[Latin alphabet|Latin writing system]] are imperfectly phonological and diverge from that ideal to a greater or lesser extent. This is because the ancient Romans designed the alphabet specifically for Latin. In the Middle Ages, it was adapted to the Romance languages, the direct descendants of Latin, as well as to the Celtic, Germanic, Baltic, and some Slavic languages, and finally to most of the languages of Europe.

===English orthography===

{{Main|English orthography}}
[[English orthography]] is based on the alphabetic principle, but the acquisition of sounds and spellings from a variety of languages has made English spelling patterns confusing. Spelling patterns usually follow certain conventions but nearly every sound can be legitimately spelled with different letters or letter combinations.&lt;ref&gt;Wren, Sebastian. Exception Words, Southwest Educational Development Laboratory. Retrieved from http://www.sedl.org/reading/topics/exception.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011183306/http://www.sedl.org/reading/topics/exception.html |date=2007-10-11 }}, September 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the letters ''ee'' almost always represent {{IPA|/i/}}, but the sound can also be represented by the letter ''y'' or the letters ''ie''.

The spelling systems for some languages, such as [[Spanish orthography|Spanish]], are relatively simple because they adhere closely to the ideal one-to-one correspondence between sounds and the letter patterns that represent them. In [[English orthography|English]] the spelling system is more complex and varies considerably in the degree to which it follows the stated pattern. There are several reasons for this, including: first, the alphabet has 26 letters, but the English language has 40 sounds that must be reflected in word spellings; second, English spelling began to be standardized in the 15th century, and most spellings have not been revised to reflect the long-term changes in pronunciation that are typical for all languages; and third, English frequently adopts foreign words without changing the spelling of those words.

==Role in beginning reading==
{{See also|Phonics|Whole Language}}
Learning the connection between written letters and spoken sounds has been viewed as a critical heuristic to word identification for decades. Understanding that there is a direct relationship between letters and sounds enables an emergent reader to decode the pronunciation of an unknown written word and associate it with a known spoken word. Typically, emergent readers identify the majority of unfamiliar printed words by sounding them out. Similarly, understanding the relationship of letters and sounds is also seen as a critical heuristic for learning to spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Juel | first1 = Connie | title = Handbook of Reading Research, II | chapter = 27 Beginning Reading | volume = 2 |pages=759–788 | editor = Rebecca Barr | editor2 = Michael L.

Two contrasting philosophies exist with regard to emergent readers learning to associate letters to speech sounds in English. Proponents of [[phonics]] argue that this relationship needs to be taught explicitly and to be learned to [[automaticity]], in order to facilitate the rapid word recognition upon which comprehension depends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chall |first=Jeanne S. |authorlink=Jeanne Chall |date=1996 | edition=3rd |title=Learning to read: The great debate |url= https://www.worldcat.org/title/learning-to-read-the-great-debate/oclc/8974797/editions  | page= |publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers |location=Fort Worth |access-date=2010-07-01 | quote= }} '''[See [[Talk: Alphabetic principle#Chall| Talk page]]&amp;zwj;]'''&lt;/ref&gt;   
Others, including advocates of [[Whole language|whole-language]] who hold that reading should be taught [[Holistic education|holistically]], assert that children can naturally intuit the relationship between letters and sounds.

&lt;!--Deleted text: The alphabetic principle is that, in such writing systems, each [[grapheme]] (contextually) represented a [[phoneme]] at the time and place of its [[orthography|orthographic]] inception or last change. ... , where one written word may have several readings and one spoken word may have several writings. The principle is generally not applied to a [[syllabary]] like [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] [[kana]], because of the huge amount of [[syllable]]s possible compared to [[phone]]s.
Due to [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] change and [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] geographical and sociocultural differences, there is, by definition, no standardised alphabet that renders the spoken language truthfully (and vice versa). [[Literal language]] is always more uniform than [[oral language]].--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11002">The '''Arts Olympiad''' is an international art competition for children ages 8 to 12 organized by [[International Child Art Foundation]] with one million participants from seventy countries. Each competition is four years long and it is held every four year. The competition includes the element of art and peace to encourage children around the world to use creativity and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promising Practices - Arts Olympiad|url=http://www.arizonahealthmatters.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=PromisePractice&amp;file=promisePractice&amp;pid=769|publisher=The Healthy Communities Institute|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dr. Ashfaq Ishaq, founder of the International Child Art Foundation, started the first Arts Olympiad competition in 1999&lt;ref name="1st-ao"&gt;{{cite web|title=1st Arts Olympiad (1997-2000)|url=http://www.icaf.org/whatwedo/ao/1st-ao.php|publisher=International Child Art Foundation|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to address the issue which was coined decades earlier as the "fourth grade slump" in creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Torrance|first=Ellis Paul|title=Understanding the fourth grade slump in creative thinking: final report|year=1967|publisher=University of Minnesota|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers at the time suggested that the phenomenon is a result of a drop in creativity around the ages of nine as they start conforming to [[standardized test]]ing and to please parents and teachers. The plan was to let children who were the winners of [[U.S. state]]s and other countries to come together in a festival to let them work together and learn other cultures with the goal to move future generations toward [[World peace|global peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Jane Hess|title=Get Out and Give Back: World Children’s Festival|url=http://www.washingtonlife.com/2011/06/13/get-out-and-give-back-world-children%E2%80%99s-festival/|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Washington Life Magazine|date=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme for the first Art Olympiad was ''My World in the Year 2000'' to ask children to create art in which they envisioned themselves in the [[new millennium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future Of Peace: Art By Young People|url=http://go.worldbank.org/HE9OOAUR30|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was one million children in 86 countries in the program which was run between 1997 and 2000. The winning pieced from around the world were exhibited at the ''World Children’s Festival'' in 1999 on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, DC]]. The artworks were also later exhibited at the [[White House Millennium Council#White House Millennium Celebration|White House Millennium Celebration]], the [[United Nations Headquarters]], and the 2003 [[Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group|World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings]] in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name="1st-ao"/&gt;

Since then the format of the global competition, a festival in Washington, DC and global exhibitions have been following in the next Arts Olympiad cycles. The 2nd Arts Olympiad was held between 2001 and 2004 with the theme of ''Me in the New Millennium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dally|first=Ashley|title=Me in the New Millennium.(Perspective)(ICAF's 2000-2004 Arts Olympiad)|journal=ChildArt|date=1 April 2003|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-140305540.html|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 3rd Arts Olympiad (2005-2008), the theme was shifted to relate art and sport&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture of Peace Project and Resources: Arts Olympiad|url=http://www3.unesco.org/iycp/uk/uk_visu_projet.asp?Proj=00087|publisher=International Year for the Culture of Peace - Unesco|accessdate=8 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707045049/http://www3.unesco.org/iycp/uk/uk_visu_projet.asp?Proj=00087#|archive-date=2010-07-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote the artist-athlete ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The President's Challenge / About / Advocates / Nonprofit|url=https://www.presidentschallenge.org/about/advocates/nonprofit.shtml|publisher=The President’s Council on Fitness, Sports &amp; Nutrition|accessdate=8 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025013502/https://www.presidentschallenge.org/about/advocates/nonprofit.shtml#|archive-date=2012-10-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth Arts Olympiad (2009-2012) continued the same theme with title ''My Favorite Sport''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCAC Partners International Child Art Foundation(ICAF) |url=http://www.ncac.gov.ng/ncacicf.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222172708/http://www.ncac.gov.ng/ncacicf.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 February 2013 |publisher=National Council for Arts &amp; Culture, Nigeria |accessdate=8 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection Process==
During the first two years of the competition, local schools are participated in the Arts Olympiad lesson plan. The artworks as the result of the lessons are then put into a selection process.

The selection process in the United States is first done from at the local [[school district]]. The selection of artworks from within a school or school district. The artworks are then submitted to Washington, DC for another selection to have a representative of each participating state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Berwick Academy selected to represent Maine at World Children's Festival|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110311/GJNEWS_01/703119949&amp;template=SouthernMaineRegion|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Fosters Daily Democrat|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, the partner in each country will administrate the selection. The selection can be in many phases involving the competition at the local level and at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=150 in Arts Olympiad|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/1/3/central/13010258&amp;sec=central|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=The Star Online|date=3 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gana niño mazatleco Olimpiada del Arte a nivel nacional|url=http://www.noroeste.com.mx/publicaciones.php?id=660595&amp;id_seccion=84363|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Noroeste.com|date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winners who represent the participating U.S. states and countries are invited to the World Children's Festival in Washington, DC.

==World Children's Festival==
The World Children's Festival is a three-day festival held every four years on the National Mall in Washington, DC for winners of the Arts Olympiad to participate. The festival includes over 50 performances and many art-related workshops. It also has sessions for the winners from different countries to co-create artworks with many adult artists.&lt;ref name="south-south"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jordan |first=Richard |title=4th World Children's Festival Held at the National Mall in Washington, DC |url=http://www.southsouthnews.com/pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=c45230b5-620e-4126-9bfe-9bcfca02812b |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714104844/http://www.southsouthnews.com/pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=c45230b5-620e-4126-9bfe-9bcfca02812b |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2013 |newspaper=South-South News |date=22 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Before the event, the Arts Olympiad winners from Washington, D.C. are asked to be ambassadors for the festival and exchange emails with international winners to welcome to the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Children's Festival|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/misc-events/the-world-childrens-festival,1209274/critic-review.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international winners are welcomed to the host families around the Washington area.

Children share ideas and work together during the three-day festival. On the last night of the festival, the celebratory dinner is held with all guests dressing in [[Folk costume|national attire]].&lt;ref name="south-south"/&gt;

Similar festivals have been replicated in other counties such as the European Children’s Festival at Olympia Park in Munich in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founder of World’s Largest Art Program for Children Earns The Academy’s Distinguished Service Award|url=http://ussa.edu/publications/news/2011/10/27/founder-of-worlds-largest-art-program-for-children-earns-the-academys-distinguished-service-award/|publisher=United States Sports Academy|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Exhibitions==
After the World Children's Festival, the winning pieces will travel to exhibitions in the U.S. and internationally. The past exhibitions have been in [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Germany]], [[Israel]], [[South Korea]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Japan]], [[Uganda]], [[Italy]], [[Egypt]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICAF Exhibitions 1998-2011|url=http://icaf.org/pdfs/ICAF%20Exhibitions%201998-2011.pdf|publisher=International Child Art Foundation|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles of Winners==
The organizer have seen the potential and the importance of Art Olympiad winners to promote the cause. An example was demonstrated when a winner from [[Peru]] who have gone through difficulties in arranging competition because there was no office of the Internal Child Art Foundation in the country, that child eventually set up and organize the competition in the country for the next season with the support from the [[Ministry of Education (Peru)|ministry of education]]. With that, they started encouraging the winners to contribute back to the program and set up a youth board for the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ashfaq Ishaq Discusses Challenges Faced Due To Lack of Arts Education |url=http://www.eclips.cornell.edu/clip.do?id=5127&amp;clipID=5127&amp;tab=TabClipPage |publisher=Charles H.

===Youth Board Members===
In each cycle of the Arts Olympiad competition, a number of winners are choose to serve the youth board of the organization. Their roles are to be organization's [[spokesperson]]s, conduct fundraising to support the programs, write for ChildArt magazine, help stage and be the [[master of ceremonies]] at the World Children's Festival, and nominate innovative leaders, companies and organizations for the World Children's Award.

Since the formation of the youth board there have been 38 members from two dozen counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The ICAF Youth Board|url=http://www.icaf.org/about/youth.php|publisher=International Child Art Foundation|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Monumental axis.jpg|thumb| Design of [[Brasília]] – influenced by The Athens Charter]]
The '''Athens Charter''' ({{lang-fr|Charte d'Athènes}}) was a 1933 document about [[urban planning]] published by the Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]]. The work was based upon Le Corbusier’s ''[[Ville Radieuse]]'' (Radiant City) book of 1935 and urban studies undertaken by the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM) in the early 1930s.

The Charter got its name from location of the fourth CIAM conference in 1933, which, due to the deteriorating political situation in Russia, took place on the S.S. Patris bound for [[Athens]] from [[Marseilles]]. This conference is documented in a film commissioned by Sigfried Giedion and made by his friend Laszlo Moholy-Nagy: "Architects' Congress."

The Charter had a significant impact on urban planning after World War II.

==Background==

Although Le Corbusier had exhibited his ideas for the ideal city, the [[Ville Contemporaine]] in the 1920s, during the early 1930s, after contact with international planners he began work on the Ville Radieuse (Radiant City). In 1930 he had become an active member of the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] movement and proposed the Ville Radieuse as a blueprint of social reform.

Unlike the radial design of the Ville Contemporaine, the Ville Radieuse was a linear city based upon the abstract shape of the human body with head, spine, arms and legs. The design maintained the idea of high-rise housing blocks, free circulation and abundant green spaces proposed in his earlier work. Le Corbusier exhibited the first representations of his ideas at the third CIAM meeting in [[Brussels]] in 1930 and published a book of the same title as the city in 1935.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=118}}

==The Functional City==

The concept of the Functional City came to dominate CIAM thinking after the conference in Brussels. At a meeting in [[Zürich]] in 1931, CIAM members Le Corbusier, [[Walter Gropius]], [[Siegfried Giedion]], Rudolf Steiger and [[Werner M. Moser]] discussed with [[Cornelis van Eesteren]] the importance of solar orientation in governing the directional positioning of low-cost housing on a given site. Van Eesteren had been chief architect of Amsterdam's Urban Development Section since 1929 and the group asked him to prepare a number of analytical studies of cities ready for the next main CIAM meeting planned to be in [[Moscow]] in 1933.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=59}} The theme for these studies would be the Functional City, that is, one where land planning would be based upon function-based zones.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=25}}

Van Eesteren employed the city planner Theodor Karel van Lohuizen to use methods developed for the Amsterdam Expansion Plan, to prepare zoning plans that would predict overall future development in the city. He relied upon the more rational methods being promoted by CIAM at that time which sought to use statistical information for designing zone uses rather than designing them in any detail.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=60}}

At a special congress meeting in [[Berlin]] later in 1931 van Eesteren presented his findings to his colleagues. He presented three drawings of [[Amsterdam]]. The first at a scale of 1:10000 showed land use and density, the second showed transportation networks and the third, at 1:50000 showed the regional setting of the city. He also presented supporting information on the four functions of dwelling, work, recreation and transport. Based upon his presentation it was decided that the separate national groups within CIAM would prepare similar presentation boards for the Moscow meeting. A standard set of notation was agreed.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|pp=61-63}}

In 1932 Le Corbusier's [[Palace of the Soviets]] competition entry failed to gain acceptance from the jury and, due to the political conditions in Russia, CIAM's agenda became increasingly ignored. A new venue for the fourth CIAM conference was required.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|pp71-72}}

==CIAM 4==

The fourth CIAM conference took place on board the S.S. Patris, an ocean-going liner journeying from Marseilles to Athens in July 1933.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=121}}

The national groups reported to the conference with the findings from their city studies, presenting in each case the agreed three boards showing a total of 34 cities. In addition, Le Corbusier and the group who had met earlier in Zürich hosted a meeting to state the core goals of the Functional City.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=81}}

On arrival in Athens on 3 August an exhibition of the Functional City boards was held at the [[National Technical University of Athens]] and inaugurated by Greece's prime minister. The boards were separated into seven categories: metropolises, cities of administration, ports, industrial cities, pleasure cities and cities of diverse function.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=81}} The delegates remained in Athens for a number of days, some visited local classical sites and others visited nearby islands. On 10 August they embarked on the return journey to Marseilles.

During meetings on the return journey delegates found it impossible to agree on resolutions for the Functional City. Van Eesteren's original Amsterdam plan had, with greater resources, a basis formed by scientific data. The plans presented by the national groups did not have this and, despite Giedion's insistence, delegates were reluctant to agree on guidelines.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=85}} Eventually, two groups agreed on two separate texts: ''observations'' and ''resolutions''.

==The Athens Charter==
[[File:Highpoint detail.jpg|thumb|Highpoint 1 by Berthold Lubetkin]]
The ''observations'' taken from the studies of 33 cities set guidelines under the titles: living, working, recreation and circulation.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=173}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
CIAM demanded that housing districts should occupy the best sites, and a minimum amount of solar exposure should be required in all dwellings. For hygienic reasons, buildings should not be built along transportation routes, and modern techniques should be used to construct high apartment building spaces widely apart, to free the soil for large green parks.

-Mumford, 2000, The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928-1960, The MIT Press, p85
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally they said it was important to reduce commuting times by locating industrial zones close to residential ones and buffering them with wide parks and sports areas. Street widths and requirements should be scientifically worked out to accommodate the speed and type of transport. Finally, with regards to conservation, historic monuments should be kept only when they were of true value and their conservation did not reduce their inhabitants to unhealthy living conditions.

The ''observations'' formed the basis of [[Josep Lluís Sert|Josep Lluís Sert's]] book ''Can our cities survive?'' and were incorporated in Le Corbusier's ''Athens Charter'' published in 1943. The ''resolutions'' formed part of Le Corbusier's book ''The Radiant City'' published in 1935.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=90}}

The text of the ''Athens Charter'' as published became an extension of the content of ''The Radiant City''{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=208}} and Le Corbusier significantly re-worded the original ''observations''. As well as adding new material he also removed the urban plans upon which the original text was based. This treatment made the Athens Charter an abstract text of general value but also transformed the original force of the ''observations'' that were founded before on concrete references.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=156}} Despite its title, the Athens Charter cannot be considered as the mutual outcome of the CIAM conference, which took place ten years earlier, but largely as an expression of Le Courbusier's individual concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archiv.gta.arch.ethz.ch/research/ciam-4-the-functional-city|title=Research Project — CIAM 4. The Functional City — gta Archives — Institute gta — ETH Zurich|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-war influence==
[[File:Rotterdam van nelle fabriek.jpg|thumb|Van Nelle Factory, Netherlands]]
The CIAM 4 meeting was influential among attending architects from Switzerland, France, England, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Greece, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Brazil and Canada.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=77}}

After ''The Radiant City'' was published in France in 1935, Le Corbusier continued to develop his ideas of urban planning through a number of unrealised schemes. These included plans for Antwerp, Paris, Moscow, Algiers and Morocco.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=91}}

In the Netherlands, CIAM delegates visited the [[Van Nelle Factory|Van Nelle factory]] designed in part by [[Mart Stam]] that was to have formed a larger part of a ''Functional City'' design.

CIAM 4 was the first congress that the influential [[MARS Group]] from England was represented. In 1935 MARS member [[Berthold Lubetkin]] and his practice, the [[Tecton Group]] completed  [[Highpoint I|Highpoint]] in Highgate, London. The project comprised 56 dwellings grouped together as two crosses on plan, eight dwellings per arm. Each dwelling is linked to a central service core but is separated from its neighbour by a balcony - a design feature that virtually eliminated noise transfer between dwellings.{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|p=94}}

In 1937 with the fall of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], Sert suggested that England and the United States may be the best place to focus CIAM's activities.

==Post-war influence==

The ''Athens Charter'' had a huge impact on planning thought after World War II.{{sfnp|Curtis|2006|p=120}} However, its influence was more complicated because in the 1950s CIAM attempted to replace the Functional City described in the ''Charter'' with a different ''Charter of Habitat''.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=268}}

===France===
[[File:Corbusierhaus B-Westend 06-2017.jpg|thumb|The Unité d'Habitation in Marseille]]
In 1946 Le Corbusier received a commission for projects in [[La Rochelle]] and St Dié. The urban plan allowed him to experiment with urban monumentality that had been somewhat underplayed in the ''Charter'', but as part of the project he proposed eight [[Unité d'Habitation]] flanked by a civic centre.{{sfnp|Curtis|2006|p=163}} Although these proposals were unbuilt, he had more success in Marseilles where an initial study for three Unités resulted in one being built. In line with the ''Charter'', the Unité was a north-south orientated block eighteen storeys high set in parkland. There is a public 'street' on levels 7 and 8 that provides various shops, offices and a hotel. On the roof there is a nursery school, a running track and a pool.{{sfnp|Jenkins|1999}} It opened in 1952 but had begun to influence architects even before it was complete.{{sfnp|Curtis|2006|p=172}}

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Alton Estate Roehampton London.jpg|thumb|High rises part of the Alton Estate]]
[[File:Parkhill2.jpg|thumb|Parkhill Estate, Sheffield]]
The 1949 Housing Act in England paved the way for [[Local government|Local Authorities]] to provide a balance of housing types for a range of communities, not just the working class. In the socialist post war atmosphere, architectural writer [[James Maude Richards|J M Richards]] praised Le Corbusier's Unité for "putting clean and healthy housing in a parkland setting".{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|pp=8-10}}

Between 1952 and 1958 [[London County Council]] built the [[Alton Estate|Alton East]] and Alton West high-rise blocks in Roehampton. Alton East comprised 744 dwellings within mainly 10 storey blocks and Alton West was 1867 dwellings in 5, 6 and 12 storey blocks. Both projects are set within parkland and have since been [[Listed building|listed]].{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|pp=147-149}}

In Sheffield in 1958, the city architect, Lewis Womersley, designed the [[Park Hill, Sheffield|Park Hill Estate]]. The product of an entire [[slum clearance]], three times the size of the Unité, dwellings were housed in a series of high rise structures connected by external decks. These 'streets in the air' are wide enough to incorporate bicycles and [[milk float]]s.{{sfnp|Banham|1978|pp=141-143}} Initial success came because whole streets were moved into adjacent dwellings on the new scheme. [[Harold Macmillan]] said it would "draw the admiration of the world".{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|p=13}}

In Scotland, the Department of Housing for Scotland encouraged Local Authorities to build more unified and open schemes. The ''Functional City'' prescribed the separation of industrial zones from residential ones by parkland. This concept suited the regeneration of industrial decay in Scottish cities. From 1956 the [[Gorbals|Hutchesontown Gorbals]] area of Glasgow was redeveloped. The architect [[Robert Matthew]] designed one of the four areas using 18 storey blocks on a north-south axis that ignored local street patterns.{{sfnp|MacInnes, Glendinning, MacKechnie|1999|pp=105-108}}

The [[Golden Lane Estate|Golden Lane]] London, was designed by [[Chamberlin, Powell and Bon]], who also designed the [Barbican], adjacent. It has a variety of dwellings and a good provision of supporting community buildings. Like the Unité it has a terrace on the roof.

The Smithsons (Alison and Peter Smithson) were against the four functions explored for the ''Functional City'', renaming them ''House'', ''Street'', ''District'' and ''City''. In the Golden Lane development the ''House'' became the family unit, the ''Street'' was an elevated access deck but the ''District'' and ''City'' lay outside the project's boundaries. Their work was never built at Golden Lane, but these ideas can be viewed in their book "Urban Structuring".

===The Americas===
[[File:Esplanadabsb12.jpg|thumb|Ministers Esplanade in Brasília]]
[[Lúcio Costa|Lúcio Costa's]] conception of the plan for [[Brasília]] saw the city as a manifestation of the Functional City. Like Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse, it was seen as a method of imposing order, progress and stability to Brazil's new capital. Like Le Corbusier, Costa and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] aspired to produce a city based upon equality and justice.{{sfnp|Philippou|2008|p=226}}

In a variation of the ''Functional City'', Sert designed married-student housing for [[Harvard University]] in 1964. Known as Peabody Terraces it was made up of three main towers set in lawns and sheltered pedestrian routes. It avoided the usual vacuum at the base by grading the scale between the towers and the lawns.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=292}}

===The rest of the world===

In Japan in 1957, [[Kunio Maekawa]] designed the Harumi Apartment block in Tokyo based upon the idea of the Unité. Meanwhile, In [[Tel Aviv]] in 1963 CIAM member [[Jacob B. Bakema]] designed a ''Functional City'' proposal based upon Le Corbusier's Algiers scheme.

==Criticism==
[[File:Pruitt-igoeUSGS02.jpg|thumb|[[Pruitt–Igoe]] housing scheme in St Louis, Missouri]]
The [[Pruitt–Igoe]] housing scheme in St Louis, Missouri was designed in accordance with CIAM ideals for the ''Functional City''. It was made up of 14 storey blocks and is often claimed to have won an [[American Institute of Architects]] award when it was built in 1951, but no evidence of such exists. [[Charles Jencks]] proclaimed that the death of [[Modern Architecture]] was on 15 July 1972 at 3.32pm when the Pruitt–Igoe housing scheme was demolished with dynamite.{{sfnp|Jencks|1978|p=9}}

Architectural critic [[Reyner Banham]] was concerned that the supposed universality of the ''Charter'' concealed a very narrow view of architecture and planning that overly constrained the members of CIAM. The emphasis on tall high-density housing amongst wide, green spaces effectively killed research into other areas of urban housing.{{sfnp|Curtis|1991|p=208}}

In planning terms the ''Charter'' had set rigid geometries for urban planning, increasingly there became an awareness of words like 'neighbourhood', 'cluster' and 'association' that demanded a more organic approach to the image of the city.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=288}}

Even by 1954 during the [[Aix-en-Provence]] meeting of CIAM the younger generation riled against the pre-war utopian ideals that the Charter represented. This disillusionment would lead to the formation of [[Team 10|Team X]] at the [[Dubrovnik]] meeting of CIAM that would eventually lead to the breakup of the Conference as an organisation.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=287}}

In the case of Brasília, whilst Niemeyer remained faithful to the ideas of zoning and green spaces, his revised urban [[utopia]] became based upon a smaller city with a high vertical concentration of people with increased pedestrian facilities.{{sfnp|Philippou|2008|p=228}} In 1958 he had warned that his utopian dream could not be fulfilled unless society itself was reorganised to suit it. At its inauguration the city was branded a [[Kafkaesque]] Nightmare with an [[Orwellian]] environment.{{sfnp|Philippou|2008|p=247}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To reduce the matter to high density when no due attention was given to communal facilities was to court disaster; to create open space without greenery was to devalue the idea of the community living in nature. The imitations of the Unité usually involved such drastic omissions. Does this mean that the prototype should be blamed for the later disastrous variations?

−Curtis, 1986, Modern Architecture since 1900, Phaidon, p293
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Recent history==
In 2003 the [[ECTP-CEU|European Council of Spatial Planners]] wrote a new version of the Charter.

==Trivia==

[[J. G. Ballard|J. G. Ballard's]] book [[High Rise (novel)|''High Rise'']] is set in a 40 storey block set in parkland with other high-rises in central London. On the tenth floor is a wide concourse with supermarket, shops and gymnasium and a swimming pool. On the 35th floor there is a smaller swimming pool, a sauna and a restaurant. As the affluent tenants embark upon an orgy of destruction, Ballard tells the story of how the whole block slowly degenerates into chaos.

'''Bachelor of Electrical Engineering''' ('''B.E.E. or BEE''') is an [[undergraduate]] [[academic degree]] offered to a student who completes three to five years of study in [[electrical engineering]] at a [[university]] or [[college]]. Many institutes offer '''Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering''' ('''B.S.E.E.''' or '''B.Sc.E.E.''') or '''Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering''' ('''B.E.E.E'''.). Program duration varies throughout the world depending upon the education [[curriculum]]. For example, in [[US]], this course requires four (4) years to complete. On the other hand, in [[UK]], it takes three (3) years to complete. In some countries, it takes five (5) years to complete. Study topics normally covered in this course are [[Direct Current]], [[Alternating Current]], [[Electrical Machines]], [[AC motors|AC]] &amp; [[DC Motor]]s, [[Transformers]], [[Electric generator|Generators]], Rotating Devices, [[Power Engineering]], [[electric power transmission|Power Transmission]] and [[electric power distribution|Power Distribution]] etc.

'''Behavioral geography''' is an approach to [[human geography]] that examines human behavior using a disaggregate approach. Behavioral geographers focus on the [[cognitive process]]es underlying [[spatial reasoning]], [[decision making]], and [[behavior]]. In addition, behavioral geography is an ideology/approach in human geography that makes use of the methods and assumptions of [[behaviorism]] to determine the [[cognitive]] processes involved in an individual's perception of or response and reaction to their environment&lt;ref&gt; Hemakumara,  GPTS.  and  Rainis,  R.  2018.  Spatial  behaviour  modelling  of unauthorised housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka. KEMANUSIAAN  the  Asian  Journal  of  Humanities25(2): 91–107, https://doi.org/10.21315/kajh2018.25.2.5 

Spatial Behaviour Modelling of Unauthorised Housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka | Request PDF. Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327864214_Spatial_Behaviour_Modelling_of_Unauthorised_Housing_in_Colombo_Sri_Lanka [accessed Sep 27 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;.

Behavioral geography is that branch of human science, which deals with the study of cognitive processes with its response to its environment, through behaviorism.

==Issues==
Because of the name it is often assumed to have its roots in [[behaviorism]]. While some behavioral geographers clearly have roots in behaviorism&lt;ref name=Norton01&gt;Norton, W. (2001). Initiating an affair human geography and [[behavior analysis]]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 2 (4), 283–290 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Norton02&gt;Norton, W. (2002) Explaining Landscape Change: Group Identity and Behavior. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3 (2), 155–160 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; due to the emphasis on cognition, most can be seen as cognitively oriented. Indeed, it seems that behaviorism interest is more recent&lt;ref name=Glass07&gt;Glass, J.E. (2007). Behavior analytic grounding of sociological [[social constructionism]]. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 8 (4), 426–433 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; and growing.&lt;ref name=Norton01/&gt; This is particularly true in the area of human landscaping.

Behavioral geography draws from early behaviorist works such as [[Edward C. Tolman|Tolman]]'s concepts of "[[cognitive map]]s". More [[Cognitive geography|cognitively oriented]], behavioral geographers focus on the cognitive processes underlying spatial reasoning, decision making, and behavior. More behaviorally oriented geographers are materialists and look at the role of basic learning processes and how they influence the landscape patterns or even group identity.&lt;ref name=Norton97&gt;Norton, W. (1997). Human geography and behavior analysis: An application of behavior analysis to the evolution of human landscapes. ''The Psychological Record'', 47, 439–460&lt;/ref&gt;

The cognitive processes include environmental perception and cognition, wayfinding, the construction of cognitive maps, place attachment, the development of attitudes about space and place, decisions and behavior based on imperfect knowledge of one's environs, and numerous other topics.

The approach adopted in behavioral geography is closely related to that of [[psychology]], but draws on research findings from a multitude of other disciplines including economics, [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[transportation planning]], and many others.

== The Social Construction of Nature ==
[[Nature]] is the world which surrounds us, including all life (plants, animals, organisms, humans, etc.) and physical features. [[Social constructionism|Social Construction]] is the way that human beings process the world around us in our minds. According to [[Plato|Plato's]] 'Classical Theory of Categorization', humans create categories of what they see through experience and imagination.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;Gerber, J. (1997). Beyond Dualism — the social construction of nature and the natural ''and'' social construction of human beings. Retrieved from http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.925.2585&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Social constructionism, therefore, is this characterization that makes language and [[semantics]] possible.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; If these experiences and imageries are not placed into categories,  then the human ability to think about it becomes limited.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;

The social construction of nature looks to question different truths and understandings for how people treat nature, based on when and where someone lives. In academic circles, researchers look at how truths exist ([[ontology]]) and how truths are justified ([[epistemology]]).&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; Construction is both a process and an outcome, where people's understandings of the word nature can be both [[literal and figurative language|literal]] and [[metaphor]]ical,&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Demerit, D. (2002). What is the 'social construction of nature'? A typology and sympathetic critique. Retrieved from https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2010/SOC165/Demeritt_2002_-_Social_Constr_of_Nature.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; such as through giving it a human quality ([[Mother Nature]]).&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Williams, R. (1983). Keyword: A vocabulary of culture and society. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used to discredit [[science]] or philosophy.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

As a subset of behavioral geography, the social construction of nature also includes [[environmental ethics]] and [[Value (ethics)|values]], which affect how humans treat, and interact with, the [[natural environment]]. It incorporates ideas from [[environmental science]], [[ecology]], [[sociology]], [[geography]], [[biology]], [[theology]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[politics]], [[economics]], and other disciplines, to bring together the social, cultural and environmental dimensions of life. Social constructionism uses a lot of ideas from [[Western world]] thinking, but it is also incorporates truths from other [[world view]]s, such as the [[Traditional knowledge|Traditional Knowledge]] of Aboriginal groups, or more specifically [[ecofeminism]]&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;Merchant, C. (2003). Reinventing Eden: The Fate of Nature in Western Culture. New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Shiva, V. (1988).

=== The Role of Linguistics ===
[[File:Raymond_Williams_At_Saffron_Walden.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Raymond_Williams_At_Saffron_Walden.jpg|thumb|Raymond Williams, author of ''Keywords: A vocabulary of culture and society (1983)''.]]
There are many ways of understanding and interpreting nature.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; According to [[Raymond Williams]], there are three ways to give meaning to (or define) nature:
# Nature as a quality, character or process&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; (e.g. human nature)
# Nature as a force&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; (e.g. weather)
# Nature as the material world&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; (e.g. the physical environment)
According to [[Raymond Williams]], language plays a role in how we understand, interpret, and give meaning to nature.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; This is how multiple truths can be valid at the same time.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== The Role of Mental Maps ===
Humans have the ability to create images of their environments through experiences in their mind.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Lynch, D. (1960). The Image of the City. MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These experiences allow us to create [[Mental mapping|mental maps]] where we can create memories associated to space.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is a two-way process where the environment provides suggestions for what should be seen, and then the observer gives meaning with those suggestions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

These images have three parts:
# An identity&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
# A pattern&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
# A [[Pragmatism|practical]] or [[emotion]]al meaning&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
According to [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]], the environmental images (or mental maps) that we make can either be weak or strong, where the process is ongoing and never stops.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== The Role of Science ===
[[Science]] occurs at many [[dimension]]s and scales that do not consider culture, but can be motivated by politics, economics and ethics.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Pedynowski, D. (2003). Science(s) - which, when and whose? Probing the metanarrative of scientific knowledge in the social construction of nature. Retrieved from http://0-eds.b.ebscohost.com.mercury.concordia.ca/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=15017498-bcd5-409d-b7ed-3d2141dad610%40sessionmgr101&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific knowledge consists of [[concept]]s and [[analysis]], and is a way to represent nature.&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;

According to [[Michel Foucault]], a truth does not have to be close to reality for it to be worth something or have power.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For [[Carolyn Merchant]], science can only be given power if a truth is interpreted as having worth.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Schools of Thought ==

[[Relativism]] is important in the social construction of nature, as all truths are relative to the perspective they are coming from. There are two schools of thought on how the social construction of nature is relative:
# [[Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|Critical Realism]] (being realistic)&lt;ref name=":53"/&gt;
# [[Pragmatism]] (being practical)&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
Critical realists reject the idea of relativism and rely more on natural sciences.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt; Pragmatists have no set opinion on the matter and rely on [[social science]] and ethics, instead.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;

According to [[Richard Rorty]], relativism is relevant to pragmatism in three ways:
# Every belief is equally valid&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# There is no criteria for what a truth can be&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That any truth can be justified by the society it comes from&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
According to [[Gilbert White]], pragmatism has four main assumptions:
# That human existence is based on putting labor into the land&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That the idea of owning anything is a [[wikt:conception|conception]]&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That humans learn from their experiences&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That engagement of the publics is what allows for commitments&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
Richard Rorty also associated three characteristics to pragmatism:
# That all theories characterize some form of truth&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That there is not difference between what can and should be done when it comes to the truth&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
# That knowledge is constrained by the conversations we have&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;
Being pragmatic is the more accepted school of thought for social construction being a relative concept.&lt;ref name=":53" /&gt;

== How Nature becomes Socially Constructed ==
[[File:Vandana_shiva_20070610.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vandana_shiva_20070610.jpg|thumb|Vandana Shiva, author of ''Staying Alive: Women, Culture, and Development (1988)''.]]
Nature can be socially constructed by both culturally interpreting and physically shaping the environment.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Peterson, A. (1999). Environmental Ethics and the Social Construction of Nature. Retrieved from https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/54464729/Peterson.SocialConstructionNature.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1517194179&amp;Signature=VH%2F5cQL2wkJVCJqk1%2BJZTifMdIY%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DEnvironmental_Ethics_and_the_Social_Cons.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This can happen in three ways:
# Using non-human symbols to represent nature ([[Totem]]ism)&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
# Using non-human animals to relate to nature ([[Animism]])&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
# Viewing nature as an '[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]' ([[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]]) &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
Constructions can also be categorized by giving them meaning through the process of [[embodied cognition|embodiment]],&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt; which has three components:

== Criticism on the Social Construction of Nature ==
The social construction of nature has room for improvement in four main areas:
# By giving more importance to how realities are culturally constructed through social interactions&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;
# By acknowledging that all science should be analyzed by the same standard&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
# By gaining a better understanding of the role language plays in constructionism&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
# By giving more importance to how truths exist and how they are justified, using [[Actor–network theory|Actor-Network Theory]]&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22037">'''Bioclogging''' or '''biological clogging''' is clogging of [[pore space in soil]] by microbial biomass; their body and their byproducts such as  [[extracellular polymeric substance]] (EPS). The microbial biomass blocks the pathway of water in the pore space, forming a certain thickness of impermeable layer in soil, and it reduces the rate of [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] of water remarkably.

Bioclogging is observed under continuous ponded infiltration at various field conditions such as [[infiltration basin|artificial recharge ponds]], [[percolation trench]], [[irrigation]] channel, [[sewage treatment]] system and [[landfill liner]]. It also affects groundwater flow in [[aquifer]], such as [[permeable reactive barrier]] and [[microbial enhanced oil recovery]]. In the situation where infiltration of water at appropriate rate is needed, bioclogging can be problematic and countermeasures such as regular drying of the system are taken. In some cases bioclogging can be utilized to make impermeable layer to minimize the rate of infiltration.

==General description==

===Change in permeability with time===
Bioclogging is observed as the decrease of the infiltration rate. Decrease in the infiltration rate under ponded infiltration was observed in 1940s for studying the infiltration of artificial recharge pond and the water-spreading on agricultural soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allison |first=L.E. |journal=Soil Science| title=Effect of microorganisms on permeability of soil under prolonged submergence| year=1947| volume=63| issue=6| pages=439–450| url=http://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Citation/1947/06000/EFFECT_OF_MICROORGANISMS_ON_PERMEABILITY_OF_SOIL.3.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; When soils are continuously submerged, permeability or saturated [[hydraulic conductivity]] changes in 3 stages which was explained as follows.
# Permeability decreases for 10 to 20 days possibly due to physical changes of the structure of the soil.
# Permeability increases due to dissolving the entrapped air in soil into the percolating water.
# Permeability decreases for 2 to 4 weeks due to disintegration of aggregates and biological clogging of soil pores with microbial cells and their synthesized products, slimes or polysaccharides.

The 3 stages are not necessarily distinct in every field condition of bioclogging; when the second stage is not clear, permeability just continues to decrease.

===Various types of clogging===
The change in permeability with time is observed in various field situations. Depending on the field condition, there are various causes for the change in the [[hydraulic conductivity]], summarized as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baveye |first1=P. |last2=Vandevivere |first2=P. |last3=Hoyle |first3=B.L. |last4=DeLeo |first4=P.C. |last5=de Lozada |first5=D.S. |journal=Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology |title=Environmental impact and mechanisms of the biological clogging of saturated soils and aquifer materials|year=2006 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=123–191 |doi=10.1080/10643389891254197 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233057180 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Physical causes: Physical clogging by [[suspended solids]] or physical changes of soils such as disintegration of aggregate structure. Dissolving of the entrapped air in soil into the percolating water is physical cause for the increase of the hydraulic conductivity.
# Chemical causes: Change in the [[electrolyte]] concentration or the [[sodium adsorption ratio]] in the aqueous phase, which causes [[dispersion (geology)|dispersion]] and [[expansive clay|swelling]] of clay particles.
# Biological causes: Usually bioclogging means the first of the following, while bioclogging in broader sense means all of the following.

==Field observation==
===Under ponded infiltration===
====Field problem and countermeasure====
Bioclogging is observed under continuous ponded [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] in such places as [[infiltration basin|artificial recharge ponds]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bouwer |first=H. |journal=Hydrogeology Journal | title=Artificial recharge of groundwater: hydrogeology and engineering| year=2002| volume=10| issue=1| pages=121–142 |doi=10.1007/s10040-001-0182-4| url=http://www.waterinfo.net.pk/sites/default/files/knowledge/Artificial%20Recharge%20of%20Groundwater%20-%20Hydrogeology%20and%20Engineering%20-%202001.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[percolation trench]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Furumai |first1=H. |last2=Jinadasa |first2=H.K.P.K.| last3=Murakami| first3=M.| last4=Nakajima |first4=F. |last5=Aryal |first5=R.K. | journal=Water Science and Technology | title=Model description of storage and infiltration functions of infiltration facilities for urban runoff analysis by a distributed model |year=2005| volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=53–60 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7518861_Model_description_of_storage_and_infiltration_functions_of_infiltration_facilities_for_urban_runoff_analysis_by_a_distributed_model| format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|pmid=16248180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduction of infiltration rate due to bioclogging at the infiltrating surface reduces the efficiency of such systems. To minimize the bioclogging effects, pretreatment of the water to reduce [[suspended solids]], nutrients, and organic carbon might be necessary. Regular drying of the system and physical removal of the clogging layer can also be effective countermeasures. Even operated cautiously in this way, bioclogging is still likely to occur because of microbiological growth at the infiltrating surface.

[[Septic drain field]]s are also susceptible to bioclogging because nutrient rich [[wastewater]] flows continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kristiansen |first=R. | journal=Journal of Environmental Quality |title=Sand-filter trenches for purification of septic tank effluent: I. The clogging mechanism and soil physical environment| year=1981 |volume=10 | issue=3| pages=353–357| doi=10.2134/jeq1981.00472425001000030020x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nieć| first1=J. |last2=Spychała |first2=M. |last3=Zawadzki |first3=P. |journal=Journal of Ecological Engineering |title=New approach to modelling of sand filter clogging by septic tank effluent |year=2016 | volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=97–107 |doi=10.12911/22998993/62296 |url=http://www.jeeng.net/pdf-62296-4163?filename=NEW%20APPROACH%20TO%20MODELLING.pdf | format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bioclogging material in the [[septic tank]] is sometimes called biomat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://inspectapedia.com/septic/Septic_Biomat_Formation.php|title=Septic Biomat: defined, properties|publisher=InspectAPedia |accessdate=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pretreatment of water by [[filtration]] or reducing the load of the system could delay the failure of the system by bioclogging. [[Slow sand filter]] system also suffers from bioclogging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mauclaire |first1=L. |last2=Schürmann |first2=A. |last3=Thullner |first3=M. |last4=Gammeter |first4=S. |last5=Zeyer |first5=J. |journal=Journal of Water Supply: Research and Technology |title=Slow sand filtration in a water treatment plant: biological parameters responsible for clogging| year=2004| volume=53 |issue=2 |pages= 93–108 |url=http://aqua.iwaponline.com/content/53/2/93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the countermeasures mentioned above, cleaning or [[backwashing (water treatment)|backwashing]] sand may be operated to remove biofilm and recover the permeability of sand.

Bioclogging in [[river]]s can impact aquifer recharge especially in dry regions where losing rivers are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Newcomer |first1=M.E.| last2=Hubbard| first2=S.S.| last3=Fleckenstein| first3=J.H.| last4=Maier| first4=U.| last5=Schmidt| first5=C.| last6=Thullner| first6=M.| last7=Ulrich| first7=C.| last8=lipo| first8=N.| last9=Rubin| first9=Y.| journal=Water Resources Research| title=Simulating bioclogging effects on dynamic riverbed permeability and infiltration| year=2016| volume=52|  issue=4| pages=2883–2900| doi=10.1002/2015WR018351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Benefit====
Bioclogging can have a positive effect in certain cases. For example, in the dairy waste stabilization ponds used for the treatment of dairy farm wastewater, bioclogging effectively seals up the bottom of the pond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davis | first1=S.| last2=Fairbanks| first2=W.| last3=Weisheit| first3=H.| journal=Transactions of the ASAE| title=Dairy waste ponds effectively self-sealing| year=1973| volume=16| issue=1| pages=69–71| doi=10.13031/2013.37447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algae and bacteria may be inoculated to promote bioclogging in [[irrigation]] channel for seepage control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ragusa| first1=S.R.| last2=de Zoysa| first2=D.S.| last3=Rengasamy| first3=P.| journal=Irrigation Science| title=The effect of microorganisms, salinity and turbidity on hydraulic conductivity of irrigation channel soil| year=1994| volume=15| issue=4| pages=159–166| doi=10.1007/BF00193683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioclogging is also beneficial in [[landfill liner]] such as compacted clay liners. Clay liners are usually applied in landfill to minimize the pollution by [[landfill leachate]] to the surrounding soil environment. Hydraulic conductivity of clay liners become lower than the original value because of bioclogging caused by microorganism in the leachate and pore spaces in clay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Kamon| first1=M.| last2=Zhang| first2=H.| last3=Katsumi| first3=T.| journal=Soils and Foundations| title=Redox effect on the hydraulic conductivity of clay liner| year=2002| volume=42| issue=6| pages=79–91| doi=10.3208/sandf.42.6_79| url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/sandf1995/42/6/42_6_79/_pdf| format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tang| first1=Q.| last2=Wang| first2=H.Y.| last3=Chen| first3=H.| last4=Li| first4=P.| last5=Tang| first5=X.W.| last6=Katsumi| first6=T.| journal=Japanese Geotechnical Society Special Publication| title=Long-term hydraulic conductivity of compacted clay permeated with landfill leachates| year=2015| volume=2| issue=53| pages=1845–1848| doi=10.3208/jgssp.CHN-52| url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jgssp/2/53/2_CHN-52/_pdf| format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioclogging is now being studied to be applied for [[geotechnical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Ivanov |first1=V. |last2=Stabnikov |first2=V.|title=Construction biotechnology: biogeochemistry, microbiology and biotechnology of construction materials and processes  |chapter=Chapter 8: Bioclogging and biogrouts |pages=139–178| year=2017 |publisher=Springer |location=New York| isbn=978-9811014444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In aquifer===
====Water withdrawal from well====
Bioclogging can be observed when water is withdrawn from [[aquifer]] (below groundwater table) through a [[water well]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Beek |first1=C.G.E.M. |last2=van der Kooij |first2=D. | journal=Ground Water| title=Sulfate-reducing bacteria in ground water from clogging and non-clogging shallow wells in the netherlands river region |year=1982 |volume=20| issue=3| pages=298–302| doi=10.1111/j.1745-6584.1982.tb01350.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over months and years of continued operation of water wells, they may show a gradual reduction in performance due to bioclogging or other clogging mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.groundwatereng.com/well-remediation-and-rehabilitation| title=Well remediation and rehabilitation| publisher=Groundwater Engineering Limited |accessdate=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oil recovery====
In [[extraction of petroleum]], a technique of [[enhanced oil recovery]] is implemented to increase the amount of oil to be extracted from an oil field. The injected water displaces the oil in the reservoir which is transported to recovery wells. As the reservoir is not uniform in permeability, injected water tends to go through high permeable zone, and does not go through the zone where oil remains.

The '''Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management''' is a graduate professional school at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].

The mission of the Bren School is to play a leading role in researching environmental issues, identifying and solving environmental problems, and training research scientists and environmental-management professionals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/about/mission.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1991, recognizing the need for a graduate school dedicated to the study of the environment, the [[Regents of the University of California]] established the School of Environmental Science &amp; Management at UC Santa Barbara.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/about/about_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Jeff Dozier]] became the school's first dean. In 1995, the first faculty were appointed, and in 1996 the first master's students were admitted, receiving their degrees in 1998. In 2000, the first PhD students were admitted. The first PhD degrees were awarded in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/about/about_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the school received a major gift from the Donald Bren Foundation to provide funding for endowed faculty chairs, faculty scholars, visiting lecturers, conferences, and student support. In recognition of the gift, the school was renamed the Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/about/about_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Bren Hall]] was completed, providing the school with the facilities and the physical focus it retains to this day.

== Degree programs ==
The Bren School offers Master of Environmental Science &amp; Management (MESM) and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Master of Environmental Science &amp; Management ===

The Bren School's Master of Environmental Science &amp; Management (MESM) degree is a two-year program comparable to the [[Master of Environmental Management]] (MEM) degree offered by other schools. The Bren School chose to include "Science" in the name of its degree to emphasize its focus on environmental science.

One notable aspect of the master's program at the Bren School is the group project. The master's thesis for MESM candidates consists of a project, usually proposed by an agency or company having a local, statewide, nationwide, or international presence. Group projects begin during the spring quarter of the first year of study, and culminate in a final presentation to the Bren community, project stakeholders, and local professionals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/MESM.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PhD in Environmental Science &amp; Management ===

The Bren School's PhD program is designed to prepare leaders in Environmental Science &amp; Management. The program is notable for its focus on a wide variety of environmental issues.

[[File:Bren Hall, UCSB.jpg|thumb|Bren Hall]]
The school's classrooms, laboratories, and other facilities are located in [[Bren Hall]]. Since opening in 2002, Bren Hall has been recognized as an exemplar of sustainable building practices. The building was the first laboratory building in the United States to receive a [[LEED Platinum]] certification from the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] (USGBC) in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/facilities/greening_bren_hall.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the building became the first structure in the nation to received a second [[LEED Platinum]] certification—the ''LEED for Existing Buildings: Operations &amp; Maintenance''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/news/platinum_eb.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017, Bren Hall received its third LEED Platinum certification. The building was the highest scoring LEED project in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgbc.org/articles/defining-projects-and-policies-2017-top-10-states|title=Defining projects and policies of the 2017 Top 10 States {{!}} U.S. Green Building Council|website=www.usgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="639">'''Certosina''' is a decorative art technique used widely in the [[Italian Renaissance]] period. Similar to [[marquetry]], it uses small pieces of wood, bone, metal, or mother-of-pearl to create inlaid geometric patterns on wood. The term comes from [[Certosa di Pavia|Certosa Church in Pavia]], where the technique was used in ornamenting an altarpiece.

'''Cleaner production''' is a preventive, company-specific [[environmental protection]] initiative.  It is intended to [[waste reduction|minimize waste]] and [[Air pollutants|emissions]] and maximize product output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yacooub |first=Ali |author2=Johannes Fresner |title=Half is Enough - An Introduction to Cleaner Production |year=2006 |publisher=LCPC Press |location=[[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] |isbn=978-3-9501636-2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By analysing the flow of materials and [[energy]] in a company, one tries to identify options to minimize waste and emissions out of [[Industry|industrial]] processes through [[source reduction]] strategies.  Improvements of organisation and technology help to reduce or suggest better choices in use of materials and energy,  and to avoid waste, [[waste water]] generation, and gaseous emissions, and also [[waste heat]] and noise. 

The concept was developed during the preparation of the [[Rio Summit]] as a programme of UNEP ([[United Nations Environmental Programme]]) and UNIDO ([[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060528092455/http://www.unido.org/doc/4460 National Cleaner Production Center Programme]&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of Jacqueline Aloisi de Larderel, the former Assistant Executive Director of UNEP. The programme was meant to reduce the environmental impact of industry. It built on ideas used by 3M in its 3P programme (pollution prevention pays). It has found more international support than all other comparable programmes. The programme idea was described "...to assist developing nations in leapfrogging from pollution to less pollution, using available technologies". Starting from the simple idea to produce with less waste Cleaner Production was developed into a concept to increase the [[resource efficiency]] of production in general. UNIDO has been operating [[National Cleaner Production Centers]] and Programmes (NCPCs/NCPPs) with centres in Latin America, Africa, Asia and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051208113414/http://www.unido.org/en/doc/4460 UNIDO NCPC Programme, including lessons learned, and contact to National Cleaner Production Centers]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the term [[pollution prevention]] is more commonly used for cleaner production.

Examples for cleaner production options are: 

*'''Documentation of consumption''' (as a basic analysis of material and energy flows, e. g. with a [[Sankey diagram]]) 
*'''Use of indicators and controlling''' (to identify losses from poor planning, poor education and training, mistakes)
*'''Substitution of raw materials and auxiliary materials''' (especially [[renewable]] materials and energy) 
*'''Increase of useful life of auxiliary materials and process liquids''' (by avoiding drag in, drag out, contamination) 
*'''Improved control and automatisation''' 
*'''[[Reuse]] of waste''' (internal or external) 
*'''New, low waste processes and technologies'''

One of the first [[Europe]]an initiatives in cleaner production was started in [[Austria]] in 1992 by the BMVIT (Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Innovation und Technologie). This resulted in two initiatives: "Prepare" and [[EcoProfit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701221957/http://www.prepare.at/ Prepare]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoprofit.com ECOPROFIT Plattform]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080109072549/http://www.cpc.at/unternehmen/un_Allgemeines_e.htm Cleaner Production Center Austria] Official ECOPROFIT Trainings &amp; Distribution Center&lt;/ref&gt;

The "PIUS" initiative was founded in Germany in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pius-info.de PIUS: Produktionsintegrierter Umweltschutz]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] operates the National Cleaner Production Centre Programme with centres in [[Central America]], [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and Europe.

G.|title=Small Group Decision Making: Communication and the group Process|year=1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Group communication ==
The first important research study of small group communication was performed in front of a live studio audience in Hollywood California by social psychologist Robert Bales and published in a series of books and articles in the early and mid 1950s .&lt;ref name="Bales"&gt;Bales, R. F. (1950). ''Interaction process analysis''. Page 33. Cambridge, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Balesss"&gt;Bales, R. F. (1950). ''Interaction process analysis''. Cambridge, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bales, R. F., and Strodtbeck, F. L. (1951). Phases in group problem-solving. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 46,'' 485-495.&lt;/ref&gt; This research entailed the [[content analysis]] of discussions within groups making decisions about "human relations" problems (i.e., vignettes about relationship difficulties within families or organizations). Bales made a series of important discoveries. First, group discussion tends to shift back and forth relatively quickly between the discussion of the group task and discussion relevant to the relationship among the members. He believed that this shifting was the product of an implicit attempt to balance the demands of task completion and group cohesion, under the presumption that conflict generated during task discussion causes stress among members, which must be released through positive relational talk. Second, task group discussion shifts from an emphasis on opinion exchange, through an attentiveness to values underlying the decision, to making the decision. This implication that group discussion goes through the same series of stages in the same order for any decision-making group is known as the ''linear phase model''. Third, the most talkative member of a group tends to make between 40 and 50 percent of the comments and the second most talkative member between 25 and 30, no matter the size of the group.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} As a consequence, large groups tend to be dominated by one or two members to the detriment of the others.

===Linear phase model===
The most influential of these discoveries has been the latter; the linear phase model. The idea that all groups performing a given type of task go through the same series of stages in the same order was replicated through the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s; with most finding four phases of discussion. For example, communication researcher B. Aubrey Fisher showed groups going sequentially through an orientation stage, a conflict stage, a stage in which a decision emerges and a stage in which that decision is reinforced.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, B. A.  (1970). Decision emergence: Phases in group decision making. ''Speech Monographs, 37,'' 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this research (although not necessarily Fisher's) had two fundamental flaws. First, all group data was combined before analysis, making it impossible to determine whether there were differences among groups in their sequence of discussion. Second, group discussion content was compared across the same number of stages as the researcher hypothesized, such that if the researcher believed there were four stages to discussion, there was no way to find out if there actually were five or more. In the 1980s, communication researcher [[Marshall Scott Poole]] examined a sample of groups without making these errors and noted substantial differences among them in the number and order of stages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Scott Poole|Poole, M. S.]], &amp; Roth, J. (1989). Decision development in small groups IV: A typology of group decision paths. ''Human Communication Research, 15,'' 323-356.&lt;/ref&gt; He hypothesized that groups finding themselves in some difficulty due to task complexity, an unclear leadership structure or poor cohesion act as if they feel the need to conduct a "complete" discussion and thus are more likely to pass through all stages as the linear phase model implies, whereas groups feeling confident due to task simplicity, a clear leadership structure and cohesion are more likely to skip stages apparently deemed unnecessary.

===Idea development===
Another milestone in the study of group discussion content was early 1960s work by communication researchers Thomas Scheidel and Laura Crowell regarding the process by which groups examine individual proposed solutions to their problem.&lt;ref&gt;Scheidel, T. M., &amp; Crowell, L. (1964). Idea development in small discussion groups. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, 50,'' 140-145.&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that after a proposal is made, groups discuss it in an implied attempt to determine their "comfort level" with it and then drop it in lieu of a different proposal. In a procedure akin to the survival of the fittest, proposals viewed favorably would emerge later in discussion, whereas those viewed unfavorably would not; the authors referred to this process as "spiraling."  Although there are serious methodological problems with this work, other studies have led to similar conclusions. For example, in the 1970s, social psychologist L. Richard Hoffman noted that odds of a proposal's acceptance is strongly associated with the arithmetical difference between the number of utterances supporting versus rejecting that proposal. More recent work has shown that groups differ substantially in the extent to which they spiral.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, L. R. (1979). ''The group problem-solving process''. New York: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional developments have taken place within group communication theory as researchers move away from conducting research on zero-history groups, and toward a "bona fide" groups perspective. The bona fide group, as described by Linda L. Putnam and Cynthia Stohl in 1990, fosters a sense of interdependence among the members of the group, along with specific boundaries that have been agreed upon by members over time.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, L. L., &amp; Stohl, C. (1990). Bona fide groups: A reconceptualization of groups in context.

Work relevant to [[social influence]] in groups has a long history. Two early examples of social psychological research have been particularly influential. The first of these was by [[Muzafer Sherif]] in 1935 using the [[autokinetic effect]]. Sherif asked participants to voice their judgments of light movement in the presence of others and noted that these judgments tended to converge.&lt;ref&gt;Sherif, M. (1935). A study of some social factors in perception. ''Archives of Psychology, 27''(187).&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these was a series of studies by [[Solomon Asch]], in which naive participants were asked to voice their judgments of the similarity of the length of lines after hearing the "judgments" of several confederates (research assistants posing as participants) who purposely voiced the same obviously wrong judgment. On about 1/3 of the cases, participants voiced the obviously wrong judgment. When asked why, many of these participants reported that they had originally made the correct judgment but after hearing the confederates, decided the judgments of several others (the confederates) should be trusted over theirs.&lt;ref&gt;Asch, S. E. (1956). Studies of independence and conformity: 1. A minority of one against a unanimous majority. ''Psychological Monographs, 70''(9), Whole #416.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of these and other studies, social psychologists have come to distinguish between two types of social influence; informational and normative (see [[conformity]]). Informational influence occurs when group members are persuaded by the content of what they read or hear to accept an opinion; Sherif's study appears to be an example. Normative influence occurs when group members are persuaded by the knowledge that a majority of group members have a view. Normative influence should not be confused with compliance, which occurs when group members are not persuaded but voice the opinions of the group majority. Although some of the participants in the Asch studies who conformed admitted that they had complied, the ones mentioned above who believed the majority to be correct are best considered to have been persuaded through normative influence.

===Conflict resolution===
Any group has conflicts, topics that people do not agree on, different points of view on how to move forward with a task and so on. As a result, to be able to overcome any conflict that might arise, a six step conflict resolution will help to overcome the problem.&lt;ref name="Guffey, Mary E. 2010"&gt;Guffey, Mary E., Kathleen Rhodes and Patricia Rogin. ''Business Communication: Process and Product''. 3rd ed. Toronto: Thomson South-Western, 2010. 32. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* All the group members have to listen carefully to each other
* Understand the different points of view that were discussed
* Be respectful and show interest in maintaining a good relationship with the group members regardless of their opinions
* Try to find a common ground
* Come up with new solutions to the problem or situation
* Finally, reach on a fair agreement that will benefit everyone

===Group decisions===
By the end of the 1950s, studies such as Sherif's led to the reasonable conclusion that social influence in groups leads group members to converge on the average judgment of the individual members. As a consequence, it was a surprise to many social psychologists when in the early 1960s, evidence appeared that group decisions often became more extreme than the average of the individual predisposed judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Wallach, M. A., Kogan, N., &amp; Bem, D. J. (1962). Group influence on individual risk taking. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, 65,'' 75-86.&lt;/ref&gt; This was originally thought to be a tendency for groups to be riskier than their members would be alone (the [[risky shift]]), but later found to be a tendency for extremity in any direction based on which way the members individually tended to lean before discussion ([[group polarization]]). Research has clearly demonstrated that group polarization is primarily a product of persuasion not compliance. Two theoretical explanations for group polarization have come to predominate. One is based on [[social comparison theory]], claiming that members look to one another for the "socially correct" side of the issue and if they find themselves deviant in this regard, shift their opinion toward the extreme of the socially correct position.&lt;ref&gt;Baron, R. S., Dion, K. L., Baron, P. H., &amp; Miller, N. (1971). Group consensus and cultural values as determinants of risk taking. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 20,'' 446-455.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be an example of normative influence. The other 'persuasive arguments theory' (PAT), begins with the notion that each group member enters discussion aware of a set of items of information favoring both sides of the issue but lean toward that side that boasts the greater amount of information. Some of these items are shared among the members (all are aware of them), others are unshared (only one member is aware of each). Assuming most or all group members lean in the same direction, during discussion, items of unshared information supporting that direction are voiced, giving members previously unaware of them more reason to lean in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;Vinokur, A., &amp; Burnstein, E. (1974). Effects of partially shared persuasive arguments on group induced shifts: A group problem-solving approach. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 29,'' 305-315.&lt;/ref&gt; PAT is an example of informational influence. Although PAT has strong empirical support, it would imply that unshared items of information on the opposite side of the favored position would also come up in discussion, canceling the tendency to polarize. Research has shown that when group members all lean in one direction, discussion content is biased toward the side favored by the group, inconsistent with PAT. This finding is consistent with social comparison notions; upon discovering where the group stands, members only voice items of information on the socially correct side. It follows that an explanation for group polarization must include information influence and normative influence.

The possibility exists that the majority of information known to all group members combined, supports one side of an issue but that the majority of information known to each member individually, supports the other side of the issue. For example, imagine that each member of a 4-person group was aware of 3 items of information supporting job candidate A that were only known to that member and 6 items of information supporting job candidate B that were known to all members. There would be 12 items of information supporting candidate A and 6 supporting candidate B but each member would be aware of more information supporting B. Persuasive arguments theory implies that the items of information favoring A should also come up, leading to each member changing their mind but research has indicated that this does not occur. Rather, as predicted by the merging of PAT and social comparison theory, each member would come into discussion favoring B, that discussion would be heavily biased toward B and that the group would choose B for the job. This circumstance, first studied by Stasser and Titus, is known as a "[[hidden profile]]" and is more likely to occur as group size increases and as the proportion of shared versus unshared items of information increases.&lt;ref&gt;Stasser, G., &amp; Titus, W. (1985). Pooling of unshared information in group decision making: Biased information sampling during discussion. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 53,'' 81-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many methods may be used in reaching group decisions. The most popular method in Western culture is by majority, but other ways to make team decisions are available. Firstly, voting by majority brings quick decision making, and that is one of the reasons why it is the most widely used. A second method is by consensus. Reaching decisions by consensus is time consuming, but it allows everyone to bring forward their opinion. A third method is by averaging. This method requires all teammates to reach a decision by compromising. Reaching decisions by minority decision calls for a subcommittee getting together and reaching decisions without the whole groupe being involved. A final method is by authority rule. In this method, the group leader listens to individual group member's ideas, and has final say on a decision.&lt;ref name="Guffey, Mary E. 2010"/&gt;

=== Nonverbal communication ===
{{Main|Nonverbal communication}}
'''Body language''' is a form of nonverbal communication, consisting of body pose, gestures, eye movements and paralinguistic cues (i.e. tone of voice and rate of speech). Humans send and interpret such signals unconsciously.
It is often said that human communication consists of 93% body language and paralinguistic cues, while only 7% of communication consists of words themselves&lt;ref&gt;Borg, John. Body Language: 7 Easy Lessons to Master the Silent Language. Prentice Hall life, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; - however, [[Albert Mehrabian]], the researcher whose 1960s work is the source of these statistics, has stated that this is a misunderstanding of the findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

=== Physical expression ===

Physical expressions like waving, pointing, touching and slouching are all forms of nonverbal communication.  The study of body movement and expression is known as [[kinesics]].  Humans move their bodies when communicating because as research has shown, it helps "ease the mental effort when communication is difficult."  Physical expressions reveal many things about the person using them for example, gestures can emphasize a point or relay a message, posture can reveal boredom or great interest, and touch can convey encouragement or caution.&lt;ref&gt;Engleberg, Isa N. Working in Groups: Communication Principles and Strategies.  My Communication Kit Series, 2006. page 137&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples list ===

*''Hands on knees'': indicates readiness.&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"&gt;Matthew McKay, Martha Davis, Patrick Fanning [1983] (1995) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bUDNZkqUt0AC Messages: The Communication Skills Book]'', Second Edition, New Harbinger Publications, {{ISBN|1-57224-592-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57224-592-1}}, pp.56-57&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Hands on hips'': indicates impatience.&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"/&gt;
*''Lock your hands behind your back'': indicates self-control.&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"/&gt;
*''Locked hands behind head'': states confidence.&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"/&gt;
*''Sitting with a leg over the arm of the chair'': suggests indifference.&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"/&gt;
*''Legs and feet pointed in a particular direction'': the direction where more interest is felt&lt;ref name="McKayMessages"/&gt;
*''Crossed arms'': indicates submissiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Tarnow, E. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Body language is a form of non-verbal communication involving the use of stylized gestures, postures, and physiologic signs which act as cues to other people. Humans, sometimes unconsciously, send and receive non-verbal signals all the time.

== Body language and space ==

Interpersonal space refers to the psychological "bubble" that we can imagine exists when someone is standing far too close to us.  Research has revealed that in North America there are four different zones of interpersonal space. The first zone is called intimate distance and ranges from touching to about eighteen inches apart.  Intimate distance is the space around us that we reserve for lovers, children, as well as close family members and friends.  The second zone is called personal distance and begins about an arm's length away; starting around eighteen inches from our person and ending about four feet away.  We use personal distance in conversations with friends, to chat with associates, and in group discussions.  The third zone of interpersonal space is called social distance and is the area that ranges from four to eight feet away from you.  Social distance is reserved for strangers, newly formed groups, and new acquaintances.  The fourth identified zone of space is public distance and includes anything more than eight feet away from you.  This zone is used for speeches, lectures, and theater; essentially, public distance is that range reserved for larger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Engleberg, Isa N. Working in Groups: Communication Principles and Strategies.  My Communication Kit Series, 2006. page 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language difficulties===

Misunderstandings in communication are common because of the many different factor, that is the way of conveying message; which is done through language.  Though there is no right or wrong way to communicate, avoiding language barriers such as jargon, bypassing, and offensive language may prevent misunderstandings in group or interpersonal discussions.
One of the more common barriers in communication is the inappropriate use of jargon.  Jargon is a fictive language invented by and for the group as a verbal shorthand.  It also syllabifies group membership when used properly.  The problem with jargon is that it can make words confusing and can be used to conceal the truth.
Another barrier to language is bypassing.  Bypassing occurs when group members have different meanings for different words and phrases and thus miss each other's meanings.  To overcome the risk of bypassing it is important to look to what the speaker wants and not always at what the speaker says.  The third most common language barrier is offensive language.  Offensive language is "any terminology that demeans, excludes, or stereotypes people for any reason.  Avoiding sexist, discriminating, or labeling talk will greatly reduce chances of miscommunication.  Remember, there is no right or wrong way to communicate.  Though language difficulties are common, avoiding barriers like jargon, bypassing, and offensive language, will greatly reduce your chances of being misunderstood.  Only through habitual awareness can one begin to truly understand and then be understood.&lt;ref&gt;Engleberg, Isa N. Working in Groups: Communication Principles and Strategies.  My Communication Kit Series, 2006. page 126-129&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4219">'''Croatian National Corpus''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatski nacionalni korpus}}, ''HNK'') is the biggest and the most important corpus of the [[Croatian language]]. Its compilation started in 1998 at the Institute of Linguistics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffzg.hr/zzl Institute of Linguistics]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]], [[University of Zagreb]] following the ideas of  [http://hnk.ffzg.hr/mt Marko Tadić]. The theoretical foundations and the expression of the need for a general-purpose, representative and multi-million corpus of the Croatian language started to appear even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Tadić 1990, [http://www.hnk.ffzg.hr/txts/mt4hnk.pdf 1996], [http://www.hnk.ffzg.hr/txts/mt4hnk2.pdf 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian National Corpus is compiled from selected texts written in Croatian covering all fields, topics, genres and styles: from literary and scientific texts to text-books, newspaper, user-groups and chat rooms.

The initial composition was divided in two constituents:
# ''30-million corpus of contemporary Croatian language'' (30m) where samples from texts from 1990 on were included. The criteria for inclusion of text samples were: written by native speakers, different fields, genres and topics. Translated text or poetry were excluded.
# ''Croatian Electronic Text Archive'' (HETA) where the complete text were included, particularly serial publications (volumes, series, editions etc.) which would imbalance the 30m if they were inserted there.

Since 2004, with the adoption of the concept of the 3rd generation corpus, the two-constituent structure has been abandoned in favor of several subcorpora and larger size. Since 2005 HNK 105 million tokens and is composed of number of different subcorpora which can be searched individually and all together in a whole corpus. Since 2004 HNK also migrated to a new server platform, namely Manatee/Bonito server-client architecture.

[[File:Fedor Bronnikov 014.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Poetry reading by Horace, an early advocate of decorum. Painting by [[Fyodor Bronnikov]]]]
'''Decorum''' (from the [[Latin]]: "right, proper") was a principle of classical [[rhetoric]], poetry and theatrical theory that was about the fitness or otherwise of a style to a theatrical subject. The concept of decorum is also applied to [[#Social decorum|prescribed limits of appropriate social behavior]] within set situations.

==In rhetoric and poetry==
In classical rhetoric and poetic theory, decorum designates the appropriateness of style to subject. Both [[Aristotle]] (in, for example, his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'') and [[Horace]] (in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'') discussed the importance of appropriate style in [[Epic poetry|epic]], [[tragedy]], [[comedy]], etc. Horace says, for example: "A comic subject is not susceptible of treatment in a tragic style, and similarly the banquet of [[Thyestes]] cannot be fitly described in the strains of everyday life or in those that approach the tone of comedy. Let each of these styles be kept to the role properly allotted to it."&lt;ref&gt;Horace. ''On the Art of Poetry''. Translated by T.S. Dorsch. In: ''Aristotle/Horace/Longinus: Classical Literary Criticism''. London: Penguin Books, 1965. p. 82 (corresponding to lines 81-106 in the Latin version). {{ISBN|0-14-044155-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hellenistic and Latin [[rhetor]]s divided style into: the grand style, the middle style and the low (or plain) style; certain types of vocabulary and diction were considered appropriate for each stylistic level. A discussion of this division of styles was set out in the pseudo-[[Cicero]]nian ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]''. Modeled on [[Virgil]]'s three-part literary career (''[[Bucolics]]'', ''[[Georgics]]'', ''[[Aeneid]]''), ancient, medieval and Renaissance theorists often linked each style to a specific [[genre]]: [[Epic poetry|epic]] (high style), [[didactic]] (middle style) and [[pastoral]] (plain style). In the Middle Ages, this concept was called "Virgil's wheel". For stylistic purists, the mixing of styles within a work was considered inappropriate, and a consistent use of the high style was mandated for the epic.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony James Boyle. ''Roman Epic.'' Routledge, 1993. p.6. {{ISBN|0-415-14357-8}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=iOMyLO_Etj8C Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; However, stylistic diversity had been a hallmark of classical epic (as seen in the inclusion of comic and/or erotic scenes in the epics of Virgil or Homer).
Poetry, perhaps more than any other literary form, usually expressed words or phrases that were not current in ordinary conversation, characterized as [[poetic diction]].

With the arrival of [[Christianity]], concepts of decorum became involved with those of the [[Sacred-profane dichotomy|sacred and profane]] in a different way from in the previous classical religions. Although in the [[Middle Ages]] religious subjects were often treated with broad humour in a "low" manner, especially in [[medieval drama]], the churches policed carefully the treatment in more permanent art forms, insisting on a consistent "high style". By the Renaissance the mixture of revived [[classical mythology]] and Christian subjects was also considered to fall under the heading of decorum, as was the increasing habit of mixing religious subjects in art with lively [[genre painting]] or portraiture of the fashionable. The Catholic [[Council of Trent]] [[The Reformation and art#Council of Trent|specifically forbade]], among other things, the "indecorous" in religious art.

Concepts of decorum, increasingly sensed as inhibitive and stultifying, were aggressively attacked and [[deconstruction|deconstructed]] by writers of the [[Modernism|Modernist movement]], with the result that readers' expectations were no longer based on decorum, and in consequence the violations of decorum that underlie the wit of [[mock-heroic]], of literary [[burlesque]], and even a sense of [[bathos]], were dulled in the twentieth-century reader.

==In theatre==
In continental European debates on theatre in the Renaissance and post-Renaissance, decorum is concerned with the appropriateness of certain actions or events to the stage. In their emulation of classical models and of the theoretical works by Aristotle and Horace (including the notion of the "[[Three Unities]]"), certain subjects were deemed to be better left to narration. In Horace's ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', the poet (in addition to speaking about appropriate vocabulary and diction, as discussed above) counseled playwrights to respect decorum by avoiding the portrayal, on stage, of scenes that would shock the audience by their cruelty or unbelievable nature: "But you will not bring on to the stage anything that ought properly to be taking place behinds the scenes, and you will keep out of sight many episodes that are to be described later by the eloquent tongue of a narrator. [[Medea]] must not butcher her children in the presence of the audience, nor the monstrous [[Atreus]] cook his dish of human flesh within public view, nor [[Procne]] be metamorphosed into a bird, nor [[Cadmus]] into a snake. I shall turn in disgust from anything of this kind that you show me. "&lt;ref&gt;Horace. ''On the Art of Poetry''. Translated by T.S. Dorsch. In: ''Aristotle/Horace/Longinus: Classical Literary Criticism''. London: Penguin Books, 1965. p. 85 (corresponding to lines 164-193 in the Latin version). {{ISBN|0-14-044155-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Renaissance Italy, important debates on decorum in theater were set off by [[Sperone Speroni]]'s play ''[[Canace (play)|Canace]]'' (portraying incest between a brother and sister) and [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi]]'s play ''[[Orbecche]]'' (involving patricide and cruel scenes of vengeance).&lt;ref&gt;See Timothy Reiss. "Renaissance theatre and the theory of tragedy." ''The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism.'' Volume III: The Renaissance. pp.229-247. {{ISBN|0-521-30008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In seventeenth-century France, the notion of decorum (''les bienséances'') was a key component of French classicism in both theater and the novel (see [[French literature of the 17th century]]), as well as the visual arts - see [[hierarchy of genres]].

==Social decorum==
''Social'' decorum sets down appropriate [[social behavior]] and propriety, and is thus linked to notions of [[etiquette]] and [[manners]].

The precepts of social decorum as we understand them, of the preservation of external decency, were consciously set by [[Philip Dormer Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]], who was looking for a translation of ''les moeurs'': "Manners are too little, morals are too much."&lt;ref&gt;Chesterfield, in the ''World'', 12 August 1756, noted by Watson 1947:197.&lt;/ref&gt; The word decorum survives in Chesterfield's severely reduced form as an element of etiquette: the prescribed limits of appropriate social behavior within a set situation. The use of this word in this sense is of the sixteenth-century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]]'s use of ''decorum'' in discussing virtue in ''De officiis'' does not distinguish it from ''honestum'', according to Melvin R. Watson, "Lord Chesterfield and 'Decorum'" ''Modern Language Notes'' '''62'''.3 (March 1947), pp. 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt; prescribing the boundaries established in drama and literature, used by [[Roger Ascham]], ''The Scholemaster'' (1570) and echoed in [[Malvolio]]'s tirade in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', "My masters, are you mad, or what are you? Have you no wit, manners nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night?...Is there no respect of persons, place nor time in you?"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kranidas, "Malvolio on Decorum" ''Shakespeare Quarterly'' '''15'''.4 (Autumn 1964, pp. 450-451) p 450; see also T. McAlindon, ''Shakespeare and Decorum'' (New York) 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

The place of decorum in the courtroom, of the type of argument that is within bounds, remains pertinent:&lt;ref&gt;"Decorum of Attorney in Argument: Propriety of Appeals to the Pathetic or Sentimental" ''Michigan Law Review'' '''2'''.1 (June 1903), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; the decorum of argument was a constant topic during the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson trial]].

During [[Model United Nations]] conferences the honorable chair may have to announce, "Decorum delegates!" if delegates are not adhering to parliamentary procedure dictated by the rules. This often happens if a delegate speaks out of turn or if the delegation is being disruptive.

'''Design and technology''' ('''D&amp;T''') is a school subject offered at all levels of primary and secondary school in England. It is used so children develop a range of designing skills and technology skills for example, using media to design their project and a saw to cut items. It first appeared as a titled subject in the first [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum of England, Wales and Northern Ireland]] in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/758394547|title=Debates in design and technology education|others=Owen-Jackson, Gwyneth, 1956-|isbn=9780415689045|location=London|oclc=758394547}}&lt;/ref&gt;. D&amp;T, or a similar form, has been taught in many countries around the world such as [[India]], United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Malta, China, South Africa, France and Finland &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/470685647|title=International handbook of research and development in technology education|date=2009|publisher=Sense Publishers|others=Jones, Alister., Vries, Marc J. de, 1958-, Buntting, Cathy M.|isbn=9789087908775|location=Rotterdam|oclc=470685647}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many international schools teach design and technology. As a school subject it involves students in designing in a practical context using a range or materials and media. It is also a university course in many countries, including Australia, Canada, the US, Singapore, South Africa, Netherlands and New Zealand, both for the preparation of teachers and for general education in areas such as [[industrial design]]. Some of the UK universities which deliver courses include: [[University of Brighton|Brighton]], [[Sheffield Hallam University|Sheffield Hallam]], [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths' College]] and [[Greenwich University|Greenwich]].

== Design and Technology qualifications ==

=== GCSE ===
With the first National Curriculum new [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE qualifications]] were introduced for D&amp;T in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Unlike the National Curriculum the previous subject titles were retained (e.g. [[craft, design and technology]] (CDT) and [[home economics]]) and others added (e.g. electronics, food technology, textiles technology and systems and control). These GCSE specifications had two assessed components:

* 40% of the final mark for  coursework
* 60% for an examination of general subject knowledge (materials, processes, techniques and sustainability etc.).

GCSE D&amp;T titles available included:

*GCSE Design and Technology: Electronic Products
*GCSE Design and Technology: Food Technology
*GCSE Design and Technology: Graphic Products
*GCSE Design and Technology: Resistant Materials
*GCSE Design and Technology: [[Systems and Control]]
*GCSE Design and Technology: Textiles Technology
*GCSE Design and Technology: Product Design

=== GCSE D&amp;T (2017 onwards) ===
Since September 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-design-and-technology|title=GCSE design and technology|last=|first=|date=4 November 2015|website=Gov.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new GCSE has been taught in England that incorporates all material areas (with the exception of food which is now a separate GCSE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-food-preparation-and-nutrition|title=GCSE Food preparation and nutrition|last=|first=|date=20 February 2015|website=Gov.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Similar to the previous GCSE, the new [[GCSE Specifications|specifications]] have two assessed components - an exam and a non-examined assessment (NEA) but with a 50:50 split of the marks. 

=== A level ===
[[Advanced Level (UK)|A and AS level]] examinations prepare students for individualised learning and problem solving, which is essential in business and industry. Time management is a key factor to candidates' success within the coursework elements of the qualification. The examinations are as rigorous as any other subject. Indeed, due to the complexity and variety of tasks and organisation skills required this examination and course is very demanding. The subject covers activities from [[Control engineering|control]] technology to aesthetic product design. Students have to use all types of computer software including [[computer-aided design]] and [[Computer-aided manufacturing|manufacture]], [[spreadsheet]]s and computer presentations.  Outputs from such work are often sent to [[CNC]] machines for manufacture.

== International Baccalaureate ==
IB Design Technology (DT) is an elective subject offered in many [[International Baccalaureate]] schools globally. Design is also offered in the [[IB Middle Years Programme]] as a compulsory subject for grades 6–10, and at the [[IB Diploma Programme|Diploma Programme]] level (grades 11-12). IB Design Technology is very similar in content to ''Design Technology'', which is widely offered in the national curricula of [[Education in England|England]], [[Education in Australia|Australia]], [[Education in Canada|Canada]], [[Education in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and many African nations. It is one of the [[IB Group 4 subjects|Group 4 sciences]].

The primary focus of MYP Design is to give students an understanding of the [[design cycle]], through a practical programme. The student will complete projects based on solving a real and authentic problem. Students document their progress as they follow the design cycle to come to a feasible solution. They create the solution and then evaluate it following thorough testing.

The Diploma Programme of Design Technology is a two-year introduction to designing, a range of fundamentals of technology, and global technological issues. It provides students with the knowledge to be able to design and make in school workshops, and also to develop an informed literacy about technology in general. Because it is an international curriculum it has a particular focus on global environmental issues. It covers core topics in human factors and ergonomics, resource management and sustainable production, modeling, raw materials to final production,  innovation and design, classic design. It covers advanced higher level topics in user centered design, sustainability, innovation and markets, and commercial production. The diploma is accepted for university entrance in many countries, and is a good preparation for careers in areas such as engineering, architecture, product design, interior design, design and education.

== Scotland ==

The '''Doctor of Architecture''' (D Arch) degree program is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naab.org/school-view/?record_id=20569&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncarb.org/become-architect/study-architecture/accredited-programs&lt;/ref&gt; The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naab.org/info/mission/&lt;/ref&gt;, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncarb.org/become-architect/study-architecture&lt;/ref&gt;  Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may consist of a pre-professional undergraduate degree and a professional  graduate degree that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.

Currently, the only University in the United States offering a Doctor of Architecture degree is the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]]. The Doctorate of Architecture was first accredited by NAAB in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arch.hawaii.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to the University of Hawaii program is open to students who have completed high school, transfer students who have completed some college-level work, and students who have completed Baccalaureate or advanced degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arch.hawaii.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Completion of the degree requires 120 undergraduate credits and 90 graduate credits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arch.hawaii.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Economism''' is a term in [[Marxist]] discourse.  It was used by [[Lenin]] in his attacks on [[Karl Kautsky]] and the Social Democratic Party of late 19th and early 20th century Germany.

{{Quote|text=The Economists [in Russia] limited the tasks of the working class to an economic struggle for higher wages and better working conditions, etc., asserting that the political struggle was the business of the liberal bourgeoisie. They denied the leading role of the party of the working class, considering that the party should merely observe the spontaneous process of the movement and register events. In their deference to spontaneity in the working-class movement, the Economists belittled the significance of revolutionary theory and class-consciousness, asserted that socialist ideology could emerge from the spontaneous movement, denied the need for a Marxist party to instil socialist consciousness into the working-class movement, and thereby cleared the way for bourgeois ideology. The Economists, who opposed the need to create a centralized working-class party, stood for the sporadic and amateurish character of individual circles [or collectives]. Economism threatened to divert the working class from the class revolutionary path and turn it into a political appendage of the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lenin|first1=V.I.|title=A Talk With Defenders of Economism|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/dec/06.htm|website=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The charge of economism is frequently brought against revisionists by [[Anti-Revisionism|anti-revisionists]], when economics, instead of politics, is placed in command of society; when primacy of the development of the productive forces is held over concerns for the nature and relations surrounding those productive forces. This debate was most notable upon [[Deng Xiaoping]] assuming leadership of the Communist Part of China, criticising the Maoist line as ultra-leftist and accusing them of building socialism before the economy was ready. Maoists in turn criticised Deng Xiaoping for abandoning socialism in favour of opening up the Chinese economy to capitalist reforms in a needless pursuit of expertise and recognition from capitalist nations to fuel growth.{{cn|date=September 2014}}

== Other uses ==
For bourgeois capitalist economists, "economism" is [[reductionism|reduction]] of all [[social fact]]s to [[economic]] dimensions. The term is often used to criticize economics as an [[ideology]], in which [[supply and demand]] are the only important factors in decisions, and outstrip or permit ignoring all other factors. It is believed to be a side effect of [[neoclassical economics]] and blind faith in an "[[invisible hand]]" or "[[laissez-faire]]" means of making decisions, extended far beyond controlled and regulated markets, and used to make political and military decisions. Conventional [[ethics]] would play no role in decisions under pure economism, except insofar as supply would be withheld, demand curtailed, by moral choices of individuals. Thus, critics of economism insist on [[politics|political]] and other [[culture|cultural]] dimensions in [[society]]. 

[[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]] social critic [[Albert Jay Nock]] used the term more broadly, denoting a moral and social philosophy "which interprets the whole sum of human life in terms of the production, acquisition, and distribution of wealth".  He went on to say "I have sometimes thought that here may be the rock on which Western civilization will finally shatter itself.  Economism can build a society which is rich, prosperous, powerful, even one which has a reasonably wide diffusion of material well-being.  It can not build one which is lovely, one which has savor and depth, and which exercises the irresistible power of attraction that loveliness wields.  Perhaps by the time economism has run its course the society it has built may be tired of itself, bored of its own hideousness, and may  despairingly consent to annihilation, aware that it is too ugly to be let live any longer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nock |first=Albert Jay |title=Memoirs Of A Superfluous Man |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12772">'''Forensic serology''' is the detection, identification, classification, and study of various bodily fluids such as [[blood]], [[semen]], [[saliva]], [[urine]], [[breast milk]], [[Vomiting|vomit]], [[Feces|fecal matter]] and [[perspiration]], and their relationship to a crime scene. A forensic serologist may also be involved in [[DNA Analysis|DNA analysis]] and [[bloodstain pattern analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Investigation by Ronald F. Becker P. 8 Publisher: Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers; 3 edition (August 22, 2008) Language: English {{ISBN|0-7637-5522-2}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Forensic Science By Max M.

Language: English {{ISBN|0-12-374989-1}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; Serology testing begins with [[Presumptive and confirmatory tests|presumptive tests]] which gives the analyst an indication that a specific bodily fluid may be present, but cannot completely confirm its presence. Following the presumptive tests, are the [[Presumptive and confirmatory tests|confirmatory tests]] that confirms what the unknown substance actually is. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncids.com/forensic/serology/serology.shtml|title=Forensic Resources|website=www.ncids.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blood detection==
Blood is composed of liquid plasma and serum with solid components consisting of red blood cells ([[erythrocytes]]), white blood cells ([[leukocytes]]), and platelets ([[thrombocytes]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forensic DNA Typing|last=Butler|first=John|publisher=Academic Press|year=2005|isbn=9781493300204|location=USA|pages=39-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To detect blood at a crime scene an array of tests can be used. The most publicized test by crime shows is the [[Luminol]] process in which a chemical is sprayed onto a surface where blood is suspected to be.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The chemical reacts with traces of blood, and fluoresces under UV light.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, this technique can produce false positives because metals and strong chemicals such as bleach will also fluoresce. Another common presumptive test is the [[Kastle–Meyer test|Kastle-Meyer]] or [[Phenolphthalein test|Phenolphthalein]] test. This is a catalytic test that detects the [[heme group]] in blood that transports oxygen and carbon dioxide. It is a two step reaction where one drop of phenolphthalein reagent is added to the suspected blood sample, followed by a drop of hydrogen peroxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/|title=Science Fair Project Ideas|website=Science Buddies|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A positive result induces a color change to pink.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similar to the Kastle-Meyer test, a hemastix is also a catalytic test simplified to a specialized strip where the blood sample is added and a positive result induces a color change to a dark green.

For confirmatory tests, the Takayama Crystal Assay or an immunochromatographic test are typically used. The Takayama Crystal Assay, which forms a ferro protoporphyrin ring by a reaction between pyridine and the iron atom of the [[Heme group|heme group.]]&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaensslen|first=R.E.|date=August 1983|title=Sourcebook in Forensic Serology, Immunology, and Biochemistry|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/pr/92422_part1.pdf|journal=U.S. Department of Justice|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Takayama reagent is added to a slide with a presumptive blood sample. The slide is dried at 115 degrees Celsius following the addition of the Takayama reagent. Then it is placed under a microscope and a positive result is the visualization of dark red, feathery crystals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For the immunochromatographic test, it functions similar to a pregnancy test where antigens present in blood are detected and a positive result is a band at the test site and control site. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.618.2623&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; After performing the various tests an analyst can confirm the presence of blood and continue to developing a [[DNA profile]] with downstream applications such as [[DNA extraction]], [[Polymerase chain reaction|Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR), [[Capillary electrophoresis|Capillary Electrophoresis]] (CE), etc., followed by profile interpretation. [[File:Sperm stained.JPG|thumb|Stained sperm under microscope]]

==Semen detection==
Semen is a colorless fluid that is [[ejaculated]] from a male’s penis due to [[sexual arousal]]. In order to initially detect semen, an Alternative Light Source (ALS) is used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Under UV light, semen fluoresces making it visible to investigators to collect samples from a crime scene. A common presumptive test for detecting semen is called the Acid Phosphatase (AP) Test.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The AP Test detects the enzyme acid phosphatase that is secreted from the prostate gland.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, this test is only presumptive because [[acid phosphatase]] is found in other bodily fluids.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To perform the test, a drop of the reagent sodium alpha-napthyphosphate is added to the presumptive stain followed by a drop of Fast Blue B. A positive result of this test is a color change to dark purple.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Confirmatory tests for semen include the Christmas Tree Stain and the p30/PSA RSID Kit.  For the Christmas Tree Stain, the sample is extracted with sterile water in order to make a [[wet mount]] on a microscope slide. The sample is then [[heat-fixed]] to the slide and stained with Nuclear Fast Red for 15 minutes, then rinsed with deionized water.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Next, a green stain is applied for 10 seconds, then rinsed with ethanol. The slide is placed under a compound light microscope for sperm observation. If sperm are present, the heads will stain red and the mid-piece and tail stain green.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, not all males release sperm in their semen. If a male is aspermic or oligospermic, they either have no sperm or a low sperm count. Vasectomized males will not release sperm as well. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When sperm cells are not present a second confirmatory test, the p30/PSA test, is performed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

PSA(p30) is a known as a [[prostate-specific antigen]] that is produced by the prostatic gland in males.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The p30/PSA test is an immunochromatographic test that detect the presence of the antigen p30 in semen samples. This test functions similar to a pregnancy test, where if the antigen p30 is present a band will appear at the test site and a control band will appear to confirm if the test is working properly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the confirmatory test are positive, then semen is present in the sample. From there an analyst could continue to develop a DNA profile with downstream applications.

==Saliva detection==
The presumptive test to detect saliva is the alpha-amylase test also known as the Phadebas Test.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This detection technique is based on the activity of the enzyme alpha-amylase which breaks down starches from food into smaller oligosaccharide molecules, starting digestion in the mouth. Using a petri dish gel, the saliva sample is added and allowed to diffuse through the gel overnight. Visualization is accomplished by adding iodine to the gel which stains the starch in the gel blue. If saliva is present, then the alpha-amylase breaks down the starch, creating a clear colored circle around where the sample was placed.

For confirmatory tests there has not been as much research done compared to blood and semen. However, [[RSID]] test have been made in order to detect alpha-amylase, but they are not always reliable because there can be a lot of false positives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Current Research: microRNA==
Testing for different body fluids with traditional serological techniques, such as those listed above, is possible, but not without some drawbacks. Firstly, not all body fluids have a reliable confirmatory test, and those that do typically require a larger amount of the suspected stain in order to perform the confirmatory test. This can be limiting if the forensic sample being tested is small to begin with. Also, serology is often done before any downstream analyses like DNA, so if sample is limited in size to begin with performing serological analyses and obtaining a DNA profile successfully may not be possible. Currently, researchers are looking into ways to identify bodily fluids with more success and less sample needed, and an emerging way to do this is with micro RNAs. 
Micro RNA’s ([[miRNA]]) are small, noncoding, single stranded [[RNA]] that are used to regulate gene expression by either regulating translation (protein synthesis) or marking messenger RNA (mRNA) for degradation&lt;ref&gt;Courts, C., Madea, B. (2010). Micro-rna- a potential for forensic science. Forensic Science International. 203; 106-111&lt;/ref&gt;. Given their regulatory role, the theory is that different miRNAs would be present in different amounts in certain fluid or tissue types because each of those tissue types should have unique proteins and mRNA based on their role in the body. MiRNAs are also an ideal target for forensic analysis because they are small compared to other cellular components, so they tend to resist degradation better than other tissue markers, which is important considering that case work samples are not always going to be in pristine condition&lt;ref&gt;Courts, C., Madea, B. (2010). Micro-rna- a potential for forensic science. Forensic Science International. 203; 106-111&lt;/ref&gt;. Finally, miRNAs have the potential to be co-extracted and analyzed at the same time as DNA, combining the two processes into one for biological sample analysis, saving time and sample. 

miRNA can be extracted using a number of commercially available kits, such as the Solid Phase QIAmp DNA mini kit&lt;ref&gt;Meer, D., Uchimoto, M., Williams,G.(2013). Simultaneous analysis of micro-RNA and DNA for determining the body fluid origin of DNA profiles. Journal of Forensic Sciences. 58,4; 967-971&lt;/ref&gt;. Ideally, like the QIAmp kit, the extraction method used is able to extract DNA and miRNA simultaneously, minimizing the amount of reactions and the amount of sample used.  miRNAs can be quantified using quantitative Real Time PCR, similar to traditional DNA samples&lt;ref&gt;Tong D, Jin Y, Xue T, Ma X, Zhang J, Ou X, et al. (2015) Investigation of the Application of miR10b and miR135b in the Identification of Semen Stains. PLoS ONE 10(9): e0137067. doi:10.1371/ journal.pone.0137067 &lt;/ref&gt;. However, primers and probes would have to be designed for the miRNA targets in order to do so. Unlike routine DNA profiling, miRNA amplification requires an extra step before the PCR process. miRNA requires a reverse transcription step to convert the miRNA fragments into their complimentary DNA ([[cDNA]]) fragments&lt;ref&gt;Meer, D., Uchimoto, M., Williams,G.(2013). Simultaneous analysis of micro-RNA and DNA for determining the body fluid origin of DNA profiles. Journal of Forensic Sciences. 58,4; 967-971&lt;/ref&gt;. Once this conversion has happened, the cDNA and the other DNA in the sample can be amplified using [[PCR]] and then separated/visualized using a capillary electrophoresis protocol. cDNA specific primers would have to be designed for your miRNA targets. The final output is an electropherogram that contains not only the STR profile of the sample, but also a peak representing which miRNA is present in that sample&lt;ref&gt;Meer, D., Uchimoto, M., Williams,G.(2013). Simultaneous analysis of micro-RNA and DNA for determining the body fluid origin of DNA profiles. Journal of Forensic Sciences. 58,4; 967-971&lt;/ref&gt;.

Current potential miRNA biomarkers: 
Research is still needed in order to narrow down potential biomarkers, as some tissues and fluids have the same miRNA expressed in different concentrations. To date, blood and semen miRNAs have been the most studied and have found promising candidate biomarkers.

'''Institute for Information, Telecommunication and Media Law''' or '''ITM''' ({{lang-de|'''Institut für Informations-, Telekommunikations- und Medienrecht'''}}) is a research &amp; educational organisation located in [[Münster]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] in [[Germany]]. All major research projects conducted by ITM are ordered by [[European Commission]]. Scientific Council of the Institute is presented by Prof. Dr.Dr. Gunnar Bender, Wilhelm Berneke, [[Jon Bing]], Santiago Cavanillas, [[:de:Herbert Fiedler|Herbert Fiedler]], [[:de:Heinz Lothar Grob|Heinz Lothar Grob]], [[:de:Fritjof Haft|Fritjof Haft]], Bernt Hugenholtz, [[:de:Hans D. Jarass|Hans Jarass]], [[:de:Wolfgang Kilian (Jurist)|Wolfgang Kilian]], [[Miriam Meckel]], [[Ernst J. Mestmaecker|Ernst-Joachim Mestmäcker]], [[:de:Ursula Nelles|Ursula Nelles]] and other prominent scientists.

== Research objective ==
[[File:Institut für Informations-, Telekommunikations- und Medienrecht (emblem).png|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;ITM logo&lt;/center&gt;]]
The Institute for Information, Telecommunication and Media Law (ITM) aims to explore the legal framework conditions of the information society. To learn from the experiences of other countries, comparative law is to be granted a special position. Furthermore the tasks of the institute members content the representation of information, telecommunication and media law in academic teaching and further training. The institute members busy themselves barycentricly with the application possibilities of interactive media in academic teaching and further topics of legal information.

The law of information, telecommunication and media is a cross-section matter which cannot even approximately be covered by any of the traditional legal disciplines – [[Civil law (area)|civil]], [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[public law]]. The ITM therefore strives for interdisciplinary research and teaching activities. For that reason the board of directors of the Institute is supposed to content each a professor for civil law, criminal law and public law. This institute structure is so far without archetype in the Federal Republic of Germany.

== Area of researches ==

=== Information law ===
Information law deals with legal problems arising from [[electronic data processing]] (EDP). Whereas formerly goods and services were in the main focus, today intangible assets like [[know-how]], [[data collection]]s, experience and ideas gain more and more economic importance. "Information Society" is a current term in order to describe our modern world where images, texts and sounds are linked in a digital way. No matter how significant information has become to our society, its legal classification is still open. Most notably in terms of [[Civil law (area)|civil law]], we have great difficulties in determining the person certain data belong to as well as in defining the individual rights involved in that ownership. These issues serve as the basic approach concerning the department’s research activities.

=== Telecommunication law ===
Research is especially required in the following fields: 
* The right of way in terms of para. 50 and 57 TKG (German Telecommunications Act)
* Telecommunications business and [[consumer protection]]
* Competition and [[anti-trust law]]

=== Media law ===
[[Media law]] comprises film and music law, more precisely legal issues of creation and utilisation of films and music. Particular emphasis is put on copyright aspects and legal problems in film and music distribution.

=== Informatics in legal profession ===
This area deals with changes in the legal professions (e.g. judges, lawyers on the private sector and those in public administration) due to the application of electronic data processing.

== Scientific activities ==
[[File:A lecture at the ITM.jpg|thumb|right|320px|&lt;center&gt;A lecture on the legal matters of [[Data protection]]&lt;br&gt;held at the ITM&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Current research projects ===
* '''CONSENT''' (''Consumer sentiment regarding privacy on user generated content services in the digital economy'') is a medium scale research project that is promoted by the Commission of the [[European Union]]. 19 partners from 13 European countries, including interdisciplinary institutes, research centres, universities and [[NGO]]´s, are participating in this project. ''CONSENT'' aims to examine consumer sentiment regarding privacy on [[user generated content]] (''UGC'') services such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]] in the digital economy. This project seeks to examine how consumer behaviour, and commercial practices are changing the role of consent in the processing of personal data and whether the recent changes to consumer and commercial practices lead to consumers (in)voluntarily signing away their fundamental right to privacy. ''CONSENT''´s multidisciplinary team intends to carry out a status quo analysis of commercial practices, legal position and consumer attitudes, identifying criteria for fairness and best practices, and then create a toolkit for policy makers and corporate counsel which will enable them to address problems identified in the analysis. ''CONSENT'' begins in May 2010 and ends in April 2012.
* '''LAPSI''' (''Legal Aspects of Public Sector Information'') is a research project promoted by the [[European Commission]] and deals with the legal problems regarding Public Sector Information. 20 partners from 13 European countries are participating in this project. The main aim is to identify and discuss legal barriers to access and re-use of Public Sector Information in the digital environment and suggest ways to overcome them. Additionally, the ''LAPSI'' project intends to build a network apt to become the main European point of reference for high-level policy discussions and strategic action on all legal issues related to the access to and the re-use of Public Sector Information in the digital environment. The LAPSI project will have a duration of 30 months.
* '''E-Learning'''. The competence-centre for E-Learning is part of the European Research Centre for Information Systems (''ERCIS''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ercis.de/home Official Web-site of the ''ERCIS'' project]&lt;/ref&gt;) of the [[University of Muenster]]. It is funded by the Federal Ministry for Education and Research with a focus on “New Media and Education”. The aim of this project is the development of a technology-driven model for organizing promotion and integration of E-Learning-Projects at universities. The Civil Law Department is in charge of the issue „Legal Aspects of E-Learning“. The ITM turns its attention mainly on problems regarding data protection and copyright in the field of teaching at universities.
* '''History of Information Law'''. The project is sponsored by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]] (''DFG'') and constitutes a scientific attempt to reveal the origin and evolution of the field of law called information law. From the very beginning of the use of electronic data processing by the public administration and the business community many legal problems emerged and had to be solved. The question to be answered is, if information law is just a generic term describing a loose selection of topics dealing with the legal review of problems concerning information, or if there is a common theoretical foundation to constitute a legal discipline of its own. The analysis of this question concentrates on the development of privacy protection, freedom of information, legal informatics and IT-law. Besides the review of significant publications and court decisions it is also part of the project to interview the prominent jurists who worked in the field of information law in the beginning.
* '''Law &amp; ICT Shared Virtual Campus'''. The ITM is a member of the Law&amp;ICT Shared Virtual Campus, a project of the ''LEFIS'' networks. The project aims to offer online based courses to provide the possibility of gaining different degrees. Thereby the head of the Project is Fernando Galindo of the [[University of Zaragoza]].
* '''Matters of Law in the German Research Network (DFN)'''. [[Deutsches Forschungsnetz|The German Research Network]] (''DFN'') supports communication and the exchange of information or data between representatives of science, research, education and culture in national and international networks. In this context, the DFN also operates as an online-provider. With reference to legal questions of liability, telecommunications and data protection, the DFN-members are faced with increasing problems. As recent dispensation on liability of providers and the new German multimedia acts could not resolve the legal uncertainty in this area, practical and efficient assistance is required. Therefore the ITM functions as a legal consultant in terms of information and communication services.
* '''Research Centre for Industrial Property Rights'''. Industrial property rights play a significant role in many sectors of economy. An effective legal protection of inventions and technical advances is an unalterable condition for a working political economy. Someone who has set up in business would quickly lose the advantage of competitors, if industrial property rights did not exist. But also many law graduates are faced with an increasing demand for skills in industrial property rights, though hardly any curriculum covers this branch of law. Since its establishment in 1998, the Research Centre for Industrial Property Rights tries to supply this need by offering additional training besides its research activities on this sector.

=== Completed research projects ===
[[File:File-ITM Library.jpg|thumb|right|200px|&lt;center&gt;ITM Library&lt;/center&gt;]]
* '''ECLIP''' (''Electronic Commerce Legal Issues Platform''). The ITM was coordinating partner of this major research project initiated by the [[European Commission|Commission of the EU]]. In cooperation with four other research institutes in [[Belgium]], [[Great Britain]], [[Norway]] and [[Spain]], questions of law with reference to electronic commerce were investigated from 1998 to 2000. The contribution of the ITM was focussed on legal aspects of copyright and taxation. Besides their extensive cross-border research activities, the ''ECLIP'' partners assisted other EU-projects by giving legal advice on technical or economic matters of electronic commerce. Furthermore ''ECLIP'' aimed at enriching the scientific debate and raising general consciousness concerning legal issues of electronic commerce. For this reason, the project partners organised specific workshops, participated in international conferences and published many works on this topic.
* '''Interactive Media (PISA)'''. This project was founded by the federal state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and aimed at the creation of an interactive teaching system on immovable property law (''PISA'' stands for a practical approach to immovable property law). The students should be enabled to deepen and practice their knowledge by the use of personal computers. Within the scope of these do-it-yourself studies, time, place and speed of the learning process can be appointed by the users themselves. The concept of the programme is based on new findings in educational psychology. Another objective of the project was the development of general standards for a juristic learning software (''EuLe'') which could be used in academic teaching.
* '''MOF-project''' (''Moderated online case study on business economics and private law''). MOF-project aimed at the development of a modular system for the moderation of interactive case studies on the internet. Then the system was applied to case studies in particular disciplines and also on an interdisciplinary level.
* '''ZAP-Project'''. Project dealt with electronic presentation of juristic information. As a main target even jurists who have only limited knowledge of EDP should be enabled to find the relevant information without greater difficulties. New technologies like the internet and the possibilities of electronic commerce were in the foreground of the project.
* '''IPR-HD'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipr-helpdesk.org/ IPR-Helpdesk]&lt;/ref&gt; (''The IPR-Helpdesk'') is a European network consisting of several research institutes, law firms and consultancies. The project is promoted by the Commission of the EU and aims at supporting the use and commercialization of intellectual property rights by SMEs (small and medium-sized entities) and research institutes, particularly on a European level. The work includes, for example, assistance in finding advisory boards for registration, protection and utilization of copyrights, patents and trademarks. The ''IPR-HD'' operates with various instruments like websites, newsletters, [[CD-ROM]]s, a helpline, seminars and workshops. The project is headed by the [[Universidad de Alicante]] ([[Spain]]) and the ''Global Europe Consulting Group'' ([[Brussels]]). The ITM serves as a content provider for the German speaking area. Further partners in the field of science are the ''Centre de Recherches Informatiques et Droit'' in [[Namur (city)|Namur]] ([[Belgium]]), the ''Institute of Commercial Protection of Law'' at the [[Universidad de Alicante]] and the ''[[Centre for Commercial Law Studies]]'' in [[London]] ([[Great Britain]]).
* '''RESPECT'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.respectproject.org/main/index.php Official Website of the ''RESPECT'' project]&lt;/ref&gt; is another project initiated by the Commission of the EU. Within the scope of the [[Information Society Technologies]] (IST) programme, ''RESPECT'' is an interdisciplinary cooperation of several institutes in [[Great Britain]], [[Belgium]], [[Hungary]], [[Austria]] and [[Germany]]. The project aims at drawing up a set of professional and ethical rules for socio-economic research within the EU. As the German partner, the ITM is developing guidelines for the use of intellectual property in compliance with copyright provisions of the Member States. For this, great emphasis is put on recent EU copyright directives and changes in national laws.

[[File:Saint Irenaeus.jpg|thumb|236px&lt;!--(approx Sidebar/Infobox)--&gt;|Saint [[Irenaeus]], the second-century philosopher and theologian who inspired the development of the Irenaean theodicy.]]
{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |challenges}}

The '''Irenaean theodicy''' is a Christian [[theodicy]] (a response to the [[problem of evil]]). It defends the probability of an [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]] (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is the [[best of all possible worlds]] because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.

Second-century philosopher and theologian [[Irenaeus]], after whom the theodicy is named, proposed a two-stage creation process in which humans require free will and the experience of evil to develop. Another early Christian theologian, [[Origen]], presented a response to the problem of evil which cast the world as a schoolroom or hospital for the soul; theologian Mark Scott has argued that Origen, rather than Irenaeus, ought to be considered the father of this kind of theodicy. [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] argued in the nineteenth century that God must necessarily create flawlessly, so this world must be the best possible world because it allows God's purposes to be naturally fulfilled. In 1966, philosopher [[John Hick]] discussed the similarities of the preceding theodicies, calling them all "Irenaean". He supported the view that creation is incomplete and argued that the world is best placed for the full moral development of humans, as it presents genuine moral choices. British philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] proposed that, to make a free moral choice, humans must have experience of the consequences of their own actions and that natural evil must exist to provide such choices.

The development of [[process theology]] has challenged the Irenaean tradition by teaching that God's power is limited and that he cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth-century philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] supported the idea that this world is the best possible world, arguing that the good in the world (including God's infinite goodness) outweighs the evil and proposing that the ultimate good of God's sacrifice when Jesus was crucified necessitated the existence of evil. His free will defence was not a theodicy because he was trying to show the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. [[D. Z. Phillips]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty of love is evident, in that love can continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. [[Michael Tooley]] argued that the magnitude of suffering is excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead to moral development. French theologian [[Henri Blocher]] criticised Hick's universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy.

==Outline==
The Irenaean theodicy was first identified as a form of theodicy by [[John Hick]] in ''Evil and the God of Love'', written in 1966. Hick distinguished between the [[Augustinian theodicy]], which is based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, which casts God as responsible for evil but justified in it.&lt;ref name=Hall2003&gt;Hall 2003, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The Irenaean theodicy is distinguished by its acceptance that God is responsible for evil, but that he is not at fault.&lt;ref&gt;Svendsen &amp; Pierce 2010, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidential problem of evil===
The Irenaean theodicy is a response to the [[evidential problem of evil]] which raises the problem that, if an [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]] (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God exists, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil in the world would make the existence of God improbable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/#DirIndVerEviArgEvi | title=The Problem of Evil | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=16 September 2002 |work=substantive revision on 21 August 2009 | accessdate=17 September 2011 | author=Tooley, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Svendsen &amp; Pierce 2010, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation and development of humans===
According to the Irenaean tradition, humans are not created perfectly, but in a state of imperfection.&lt;ref name=S&amp;P2010&gt;Svendsen &amp; Pierce 2010, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; The theodicy teaches that creation has two stages: humans were first created in the image of God, and will then be created in the likeness of God. Humans are imperfect because the second stage is incomplete, entailing the potential, not yet actualised, for humans to reach perfection. To achieve this likeness of God, humans must be refined and developed.&lt;ref&gt;Engel, Soldan &amp; Durand 2004, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The theodicy proposes that evil and suffering exists in the world because this is the best way for humans to develop. As such, the Irenaean theodicy is sometimes referred to as the "soul-making theodicy", a phrase taken from the poet [[John Keats]].&lt;ref name=S&amp;P2010 /&gt;

===Greatest possible world===
Typical to variations of the Irenaean theodicy is the notion that the present world is the greatest possible world, or the [[best of all possible worlds]].&lt;ref&gt;Eriksen 1998, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the Irenaean idea of human development, suggesting that the best possible world would be best suited to human development: a world containing evil and suffering would allow development better than one which does not, so the world is considered the best possible world.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood &amp; Alles 2006, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Sistine jonah.jpg|thumb|Irenaeus used the Biblical example of Jonah as someone whose suffering brought about a greater good]]

===Irenaeus===
Second-century philosopher [[Irenaeus]] developed a theodicy based on the idea that the creation of humans is still in progress.&lt;ref name="Encountering evil"&gt;Davis 2001, pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that creation consists of two distinct parts: first in the [[image of God]], then in the likeness of God.  Irenaeus believed the first stage is complete, but the second stage requires humans to develop and grow into the likeness of God, a stage which Irenaeus believed is still in progress. He believed that, in order to achieve moral perfection, humans must be given free choice, with the actual possibility of choosing to do evil.&lt;ref name=ESD2007&gt;Engel, Soldan &amp; Durand 2007, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus argued that for humans to have free will, God must be at an [[epistemology|epistemic distance]] (or intellectual distance) from humans, far enough that belief in God remains a free choice.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2001, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Irenaeus saw the purpose of the world to be the development of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the [[Book of Genesis]] that his creation was good to mean that the world is fit for purpose, rather than being free from suffering.&lt;ref name=ESD2007 /&gt; To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of [[Jonah]], from the [[Book of Jonah]]. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, Ch. ''God endured Jonah's absorption, man's long punishment.'' p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

Irenaeus' [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] was based on a literal interpretation of the Bible, especially the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;Minns 2010, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that there would be 6000 years of suffering before the world ends in a fiery purge. This fire would purify believers ahead of a new human community existing in the [[New Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Barber &amp; Neville 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The afterlife, Irenaeus proposed, focuses more on time than space; he looked forward to a time in which humans are fully developed and live the life of God.&lt;ref&gt;Bretherton 2011, Ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origen===
Early Christian theologian [[Origen]] also presented suffering as necessary for the development of human beings. Theologian Mark Scott has argued that John Hick's theodicy is more closely aligned with Origen's beliefs than Irenaeus' and ought to be called an "Origenian theodicy". Origen used two metaphors for the world: it is a school and a hospital for souls, with God as Teacher and Physician, in which suffering plays both an educative and healing role. Through an [[allegory|allegorical]] reading of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] and the books of [[Solomon]], Origen casts human development as a progression though a series of stages which take place in this life and after death. Origen believed that all humans will eventually reach heaven as the logical conclusion of God being 'all in all'. Hell is a metaphor for the purification of our souls: our sinful nature goes to 'Hell' and our original nature, created by God, goes to heaven. Scott argues that significant aspects of Origen's theology mean that there is a stronger continuation between it and Hick's theodicy. These aspects are Origen's allegorical treatment of [[Adam and Eve]], the presentation of the world as a hospital or schoolroom, the progression he advocates of the human soul, and his universalism.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2010, pp. 322-333&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friedrich Schleiermacher===
In the early 19th century, Friedrich Schleiermacher wrote ''Speeches'' and ''The Christian Faith'', proposing a theodicy which John Hick later identified as Irenaean in nature. Schleiermacher began his theodicy by asserting that God is omnipotent and benevolent and concluded that, because of this, "God would create flawlessly". He proposed that it would be illogical for a perfect creation to go wrong (as Augustine had suggested) and that evil must have been created by God for a good reason.&lt;ref&gt;Engel &amp; Soldan 2008, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Schleiermacher conceived a perfect world to be one in which God's purposes can naturally be achieved, and will ultimately lead to dependence on God. He conceived sin as being an obstruction to humanity's dependence on God, arguing that it is almost inevitable, but citing Jesus as an example of a sinless man, whose consciousness of God was unobstructed.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Peters, Hewlett &amp; Russell 2008, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; This theology led Schleiermacher to [[Christian Universalism|universalism]], arguing that it is God's will for everyone to be saved and that no person could alter this.&lt;ref name=Hall2122&gt;Hall 2003, pp. 21–22&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|If we proceed on this definite assumption that all belonging to the human race are eventually taken up into loving fellowship with Christ, there is nothing for it but this single divine fore-ordination.|Friedrich Schleiermacher|The Christian Faith&lt;ref name=Hall2122 /&gt;}}

===John Hick===

[[John Wick]] published ''[[Evil and the God of Love]]'' in 1966, in which he developed a theodicy based on the work of Irenaeus. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, based on human development.&lt;ref name="Hall2003" /&gt; Hick framed his theodicy as an attempt to respond to the problem of evil in light of scientific development, such as Darwin's [[theory of evolution]], and as an alternative to the traditionally accepted [[Augustinian theodicy]].&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting the idea that humans were created perfectly and then [[original sin|fell away from perfection]], Hick instead argued that humans are still in the process of creation.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman &amp; Rea 2011, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; He interpreted the [[fall of man]], described in the [[book of Genesis]], as a mythological description of the current state of humans.&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hick/#SH3a | title=John Hick (1922– ) | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=3 November 2009 | accessdate=6 September 2011 | author=Cramer, David C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hick used Irenaeus' notion of two-stage creation and supported the belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity.&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2001, pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will.&lt;ref name=IEP /&gt; Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if there is an element of mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2010, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt;

The value Hick placed on free will was the result of his belief that it is necessary for genuine love: he believed that love which is not freely chosen is valueless. A genuinely loving God, he argued, would have created humans with free will. Hick held that it would be possible for God to create beings that would always freely choose to do good, but argued that a genuine relationship requires the possibility of rejection.&lt;ref&gt;Cheetham 2003, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; Irenaeus' notion of humans existing at an "epistemic distance" from God also influenced Hick, as it would ensure a free choice in belief in God.&lt;ref name=IEP /&gt; Hick argued that a world without pain or suffering would prevent moral development; such a world would have no fixed structure, or have a structure subject to divine intervention, preventing humans from coming to any harm. Hick argued that this would leave humans unable to help or harm one another, allowing them no moral choices and so preventing moral development.&lt;ref&gt;Stump 1999, pp. 222–227&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of his theodicy required Hick to propose an [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]] in which humans are fully morally developed. He proposed a [[universalism|universalist]] theory, arguing that all humans would eventually reach heaven. Hick believed that there would be no benefit or purpose to an eternal Hell, as it would render any moral development inconsequential. The eternal suffering of Hell could not be explained in terms of human development, so Hick rejected it. Despite this, he did not reject the existence of Hell outright, as to do so could make living morally in this life irrelevant. Rather, he argued that Hell exists as a mythological concept and as a warning of the importance of this life.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 2003, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Swinburne===
British philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] proposed a version of the Irenaean theodicy based on his [[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]] view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent.&lt;ref&gt;Little 2005, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability.&lt;ref&gt;Stump 1999, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil in order to understand the consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell &amp; Wilkinson 2010, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment,&lt;ref&gt;Hall 2003, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 2003, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Process theology===
[[File:Dr.griffin.jpg|thumb|Process theologian David Ray Griffin contested "the utility of soul making"]]
The development of [[process theology]] has presented a challenge to the Irenaean theodicy. The doctrine proposes that God is benevolent but suggests that his power is restricted to persuasion, rather than coercion and so is unable to prevent certain evil events from occurring.&lt;ref&gt;Migliore 2004, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Process theology accepts God's indirect responsibility for evil, but maintains that he is blameless, and does everything in his power to bring about good.&lt;ref&gt;Melse 1993, pp. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction to process theology, C. Robert Melse argued that, although suffering does sometimes bring about good, not all suffering is valuable and that most does more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;Melse 1993, pp. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Process theologian [[David Ray Griffin|David Griffin]] contested "the utility of soul making". He argued that the Irenaean theodicy supposes that God inflicts pain for his own ends, which Griffin regarded as immoral.&lt;ref&gt;Thiselton 2005, pp. 131–133&lt;/ref&gt;

===D. Z. Phillips===
[[File:Birkenau gate.JPG|thumb|D. Z. Phillips argued that the magnitude of suffering experienced in the Holocaust cannot be justified by any apparent gains]]
Philosopher [[Dewi Zephaniah Phillips]] published ''The Problem of Evil and the Problem of God'' in 2004, presenting a challenge to the Irenaean theodicy. Phillips maintained throughout his work that humans are incapable of fully understanding God, and presented an understanding of the moral diversity of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson &amp; Campbell 2010, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; With reference to the suffering of [[the Holocaust]], he rejected any theodicy which presents suffering as instrumental, arguing that such suffering cannot be justified, regardless of any good that comes of it.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson &amp; Campbell 2010, p. 183–184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fyodor Dostoyevsky===

Russian novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] presented a similar argument in his novel, ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]''. This is however not a final argument, given the nature of Dostoyevsky's work as polyphonic.  In the novel, the character Ivan Karamazov presents an account of incredible cruelty to innocent people and children to his theist brother, Alyosha. Following this, Ivan asks his brother if he would, hypothetically, choose to be the architect of the eternal happiness of mankind, which would come into existence, if, and only if he would torture an innocent child, a necessary evil, after which this eternal happiness would 
come into existence.&lt;ref&gt;Aitfield 2006, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quotation
|"Would you consent to be the architect under those conditions? Tell me honestly!"
&lt;br /&gt;
"No, I wouldn't agree," said Alyosha quietly.
|Fyodor Dostoyevsky
|''The Brothers Karamazov'', p. 308&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart 2550, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But Dostoyevsky's work, polyphonic in nature, also states that the love Christ showed to all people and for all people, which is Alyosha's final stance in the novel, is the only good, and in the face of evil, the beauty that will save the world.

===Michael Tooley===
Writing in the [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], [[Michael Tooley]] rejected the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He argued that the magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, as well as people who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/#SouMakThe | title=The Problem of Evil | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=16 September 2002 | accessdate=12 February 2012 | author=Tooley, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Henri Blocher===
French theologian [[Henri Blocher]] criticised the universalism of John Hick's theory. Blocher argued that universalism contradicts free will, which is vital to the Irenaean theodicy, because, if everyone will receive salvation, humans cannot choose to reject God. Hick did attempt to address this issue: he argued that a free action is one which reflects that character of a person, and that humans were created with a "Godward bias", so would choose salvation. Blocher proposed that Hick must then accept a level of [[determinism]], though not going all the way.&lt;ref&gt;Blocher 2005, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''James Hutton Institute''' is an interdisciplinary scientific research institute in [[Scotland]] established in 2011, through the merger of [[Scottish Crop Research Institute]] (SCRI) and the [[Macaulay Institute|Macaulay Land Use Research Institute]]. The institute, named after Scottish [[geologist]] [[James Hutton]], one of the leading figures of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], combines existing Scottish expertise in [[agricultural research]], [[soil science|soils]] and [[land use]], and works in fields including [[food security|food]] and [[energy security]], [[biodiversity]], and [[climate change]]. With more than 600 employees, the institute is among the largest research centres in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://business.scotsman.com/business/New-centre-to-honour-39father.6619686.jp | title=New centre to honour 'father of geology' | date=9 November 2010 | accessdate=18 July 2016 | newspaper=[[The Scotsman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] under Scottish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Scottish charity|SC041796|The James Hutton Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute has its main offices in [[Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee]] with farms and field research stations at [[Glensaugh]], [[Hartwood]] and [[Balruddery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQs|url=http://www.hutton.ac.uk/about/faqs|website=Hutton.ac.uk|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dundee site also hosts the Plant Sciences department of the [[University of Dundee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee|title=Plant Sciences|url=http://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/research/ps|website=LifeSci.Dundee.ac.uk|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The James Hutton Institute also formally contains '''Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland''' (BioSS) which has staff based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Dundee]], [[Aberdeen]] and [[Ayr]]. BioSS undertakes research, consultancy and training in mathematics and statistics as applied to agriculture, the environment, food and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BioSS: Home Page|url=http://www.bioss.ac.uk/|website=BioSS.ac.uk|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic oversight of the development of BioSS is provided by a Strategic Planning Group composed of senior representatives from BioSS' principal stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Biomathematics &amp; Statistics Scotland|title=Corporate Plan 2012-2016|url=http://www.bioss.ac.uk/BioSS_Corporate_Plan_2012.pdf|website=BioSS.ac.uk|publisher=Biomathematics &amp; Statistics Scotland|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BioSS and the James Hutton Institute are two of a family of six organisations termed the Main Research Providers for the [[Scottish Government]] Rural and Environment Research and Analytical Services Division (RESAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=The Scottish Government|title=Rural Affairs, Food and the Environment - Main Research Providers|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Research/About/EBAR/research-providers|website=Gov.Scot|accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the Institute announced that it was formally joining the [[Natural Capital Initiative]], a leading UK partnership that brings together policymakers, scientists, business, industry to find the most effective ways safeguard important ecosystems and [[natural capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=James Hutton Institute joins the Natural Capital Initiative|url=http://www.hutton.ac.uk/news/james-hutton-institute-joins-natural-capital-initiative|website=Hutton.ac.uk|accessdate=18 July 2016|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kathryn Bridges Harley Clancy''' (also known as '''Kate Clancy''') is an American [[Biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] who specialises in [[reproductive health]]. She is Associate Professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], in the Department of [[Anthropology]]. Her additional research and policy advocacy work focuses on [[sexual harassment]] in [[science]] and [[Academy|academia]].

== Fertility research ==
Clancy's [[fertility]] research focuses on menstruation and variability in [[Endometrium|endometrial]] function. Clancy's early published research demonstrated that, contrary to previous belief, menstruation does not increase risk for iron-deficiency anemia. Instead, Clancy and colleagues show that a thicker endometrium is associated with greater iron reserves amongst healthy women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Nenko|first2=Ilona|last3=Jasienska|first3=Grazyna|date=September 2006|title=Menstruation does not cause anemia: endometrial thickness correlates positively with erythrocyte count and hemoglobin concentration in premenopausal women|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=710–713|doi=10.1002/ajhb.20538|issn=1042-0533|pmid=16917885}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy's later studies focus on rural Polish populations. Clancy explores potential variation amongst endometrial function, or the functions of the inner mucous membrane layer of the [[uterus]]. Her research finds that endometrial thickness is negatively correlated over the latter phase of the menstrual cycle (the [[luteal phase]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B.H.|date=2007-09-01|title=Unexpected luteal endometrial decline in a healthy rural Polish population|url=http://www.ejog.org/article/S0301-2115(06)00461-1/fulltext|journal=European Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology and Reproductive Biology|language=English|volume=134|issue=1|pages=133–134|doi=10.1016/j.ejogrb.2006.07.041|issn=0301-2115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clancy's research contributes to understandings of fertility variation amongst normal, premenopausal Western women. For example, Swedish women appear to show an increase in endometrial thickness in the early part of the luteal phase, while for Canadian and English women, patterns appear largely stable at similar times. Canadian and Swedish women's endometrial thickness drops at other times, and while for Scottish sample, there is an increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CLANCY|first=KATHRYN B.H.|last2=ELLISON|first2=PETER T.|last3=JASIENSKA|first3=GRAZYNA|last4=BRIBIESCAS|first4=RICHARD G.|date=2009|title=Endometrial thickness is not independent of luteal phase day in a rural Polish population|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/117/3/117_090130/_html|journal=Anthropological Science|language=en|volume=117|issue=3|pages=157–163|doi=10.1537/ase.090130|issn=0918-7960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy and colleagues' research suggests that endometrial thickness should be measured daily to better capture and study this variation.

Clancy has also made a broader contribution to the study of human evolutionary biology and ecological stress on ovaries and endometrial function. She finds that immune stress and psychosocial stress impacts on the endometrium's ability to carry a fetus through the mechanism of inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B.H.|date=2009-01-01|title=Reproductive ecology and the endometrium: Physiology, variation, and new directions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21188/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=140|issue=S49|pages=137–154|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21188|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clancy's later research focuses on primate development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461440598|title=Building Babies - Primate Development in Proximate and {{!}} Kathryn B.H.

== Sexual harassment research ==
Clancy is part of a team of [[anthropologist]]s who led the '''Survey of Academic Field Experiences''' study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Nelson|first2=Robin G.|last3=Rutherford|first3=Julienne N.|last4=Hinde|first4=Katie|date=2014-07-16|title=Survey of Academic Field Experiences (SAFE): Trainees Report Harassment and Assault|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=9|issue=7|pages=e102172|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0102172|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[SAFE13 Study|SAFE13]]. The study, co-authored with Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and Katie Hinde, analysed experiences of sexual harassment and [[sexual assault]] in scientific fieldwork sites. The study found the majority of researchers had been exposed to, or experienced, sexual harassment, especially women and junior scientists.

A follow-up study (known as "'''SAFE 2'''"), led by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy identified systemic patterns that lead to negative fieldwork experiences and harassment. Field sites that have clear codes of conduct and consequences for behaviour are less likely to lead to sexual harassment. Where problems arise, these sites deal with issues swiftly and consistently, leading to higher levels of perceived safety and equality. In fieldwork sites where clear rules and consequences do not exist or are ambiguous, leaders do not take action against harassment. This leads to ongoing alienation and professional retaliation.

The SAFE13 study and subsequent research and activities (media interviews, conferences and advocacy) have made significant impact on increasing awareness of institutional responses to sexual harassment, as well as policy reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marieclaire.com/career-advice/a14104684/sexual-harassment-assault-in-science-field/|title="It Gnaws Away at Me": Female Scientists Report a Horrifying Culture of Sexual Assault|date=2017-12-11|work=Marie Claire|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 2018, Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/subcommittee-research-and-technology-hearing-review-sexual-harassment-and|title=Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing - A Review of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Science|date=2018-02-27|work=Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science.

=== Racism and gender harassment ===
In 2017, Clancy led another study on sexual harassment in collaboration with Katharine M. N. Lee, Erica M. Rodgers and Christina Richey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Kathryn B. H.|last2=Lee|first2=Katharine M. N.|last3=Rodgers|first3=Erica M.|last4=Richey|first4=Christina|date=2017-07-01|title=Double jeopardy in astronomy and planetary science: Women of color face greater risks of gendered and racial harassment|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JE005256/abstract|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets|language=en|volume=122|issue=7|pages=2017JE005256|doi=10.1002/2017JE005256|issn=2169-9100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research involved an online survey of 474 astronomers and planetary scientists. It is the first study of its kind in the physical sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lallensack|first=Rachael|date=2017-07-20|title=Female astronomers of colour face daunting discrimination|url=https://www.nature.com/news/female-astronomers-of-colour-face-daunting-discrimination-1.22291|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=547|issue=7663|pages=266–267|doi=10.1038/nature.2017.22291}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the first large study to examine both gender and racial harassment in academic science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/07/its-2017-and-women-of-colour-in-science-are-still-being-harassed/|title=It's 2017, And Women Of Colour In Science Are Still Being Harassed|date=2017-07-11|work=Gizmodo Australia|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study finds that 88% of participants had heard negative language at work, along with other verbal and physical abuse that made them feel unsafe. Women of colour, however, experienced the greatest level of hostility due to their race and gender. They experienced greater incidents of gendered and racialised harassment and were more attuned to noticing other forms of harassment such as homophobia. Forty percent of women of colour feel unsafe at work due to their gender or sex, and 28% due to their race. Women of colour are also more likely to skip educational and professional opportunities, such as meetings and conferences, in an attempt to minimise exposure to hostility and harassment.

The study received wide media coverage, as it provided evidence on how harassment limits women's career outcomes, especially for racial minority women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/07/11/women-of-color-face-staggering-harassment-in-space-science/|title=Women of color face staggering harassment in space science|last=Kaplan|first=Sarah|date=2017-07-11|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clancy also noted that the study unearths how survivors are re-traumatised by existing reporting systems that have no intermediary level of support in between staying silent and launching a formal report.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study has been commended for showing how racial discrimination compounds experiences of sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/07/14/women-color-stem-face-greater-risks-gender-racial-harassment-work/467501001/|title=Women of color in STEM face greater risks of gender, racial harassment at work|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also shows that the impact of harassment contributes to a higher loss of women of colour in science relative to White women scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/azeenghorayshi/unsafe-science|title=Many Women Of Color Feel Unsafe Working In Science, New Study Finds|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study raises questions about [[Bystander effect|bystander interventions]], given the hostile culture towards women of colour is evident to witnesses, who do not feel empowered to act.

Clancy served on the [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's]] 2018 consensus report entitled "Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture, and Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-08-01|title=Sexual Harassment of Women|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24994/sexual-harassment-of-women-climate-culture-and-consequences-in-academic|language=en|doi=10.17226/24994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20894">In [[persuasion|persuasive]] communication, the order of the information's presentation influences opinion formation.  The '''law of primacy in persuasion''', otherwise known as a primacy effect, as postulated by [[Frederick Hansen Lund]] in 1925 holds that the side of an issue presented first will have greater effectiveness in persuasion than the side presented subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stone, Vernon A.|year=1969|title=A Primacy Effect in Decision-Making by Jurors|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=19|issue=3|pp=239–247|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1969.tb00846.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lund presented college students with a document in support of one side of a controversial issue and then presented a second document which supported the opposite position. He found the document read first had greater influence, regardless of which position it expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ciadvertising.org/student_account/fall_01/adv382j/mgautam/minx_paper/primacy.html | work= ADV 382J: Fall 2001, "Theories of Persuasive Communication &amp; Consumer Decision Making"|title= Primacy-Recency |publisher = Center for Interactive Advertising, The [[University of Texas at Austin]] |accessdate=2007-11-04 | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This empirical evidence was generally accepted until 1950, when Cromwell published findings of the opposite: a '''recency effect''' in which arguments presented later had greater effectiveness in persuasion than arguments presented first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciadvertising.org/sa/spring_04/adv382j/christine/primacy.html |title= Order Effects Theory : Primacy versus Recency |publisher = Center for Interactive Advertising, The [[University of Texas at Austin]] |author = Kohler, Christine|accessdate=2007-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It now appears that both primacy and recency effects occur in persuasion.

==Theoretical background==

There are many different theoretical models proposed to explain the occurrence of primacy and recency effects.

=== Sensory-variation===
Schultz (1963) developed the "sensory-variation" hypothesis for order effects, which suggests that humans seek high activation and will respond to novel stimuli more strongly than to stimuli they are familiar with. Novel stimuli should provide higher activation than familiar information, according to this theory. Shultz developed four postulates from this general hypothesis: 
# When a person encounters a topic for the first time, the communication is perceived as novel and causes high activation. Any subsequent communication on the same topic produces less activation, and so the person will react according to the initial communication in an attempt to experience the higher activation. A primacy effect should be observed in this scenario.
# If the person is allowed to record his opinion after each communication, the person will respond more to the communication that he encounters either second in a group of two or last in a group of three or more  in order to maintain a high level of activation. Therefore, a recency effect is hypothesized. 
# When a time delay or another task is inserted between the two communications, the higher level of activation will be dissipated by the time the second communication occurs. The second communication acts as a novel stimulus in this scenario. Either a recency effect or no order effect will occur in this scenario. 
# When communications are familiar, such as social issues or current issues, the first communication will not produce activation that is less than the activation for unfamiliar communication. However, some aspect of the communication may be novel, and so there may be some increased activation. Therefore, either a small primacy effect or no  order effect will be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schultz, D. P.|year=1963|title=Primacy-recency within a sensory variation framework|journal=The Psychological Record|volume=13|issue=2|pp=129–139|doi=10.1007/BF03393511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attention decrement===

Anderson (1981) theorized that order effects occur due to "attention decrement". According to this theory,  when the first piece of information is presented about an opinion, people tend to pay less attention to subsequent information that may provide evidence to the contrary opinion. Therefore, people's opinions about something are influenced strongly by the information that they paid attention to, which was the first information presented to them. This model of "attention decrement" predicts a primacy effect in opinion formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anderson, N.H.|year=1981|title=Foundations of information integration theory|location=New York|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The belief-adjustment model===
Hogarth and Einhorn (1992) proposed the belief-adjustment model to try to predict in which situations order effects would occur and what specific order effect will occur. According to Hogarth and Einhorn, early information forms an initial impression, which is called an anchor. This anchor is then adjusted as new information is processed. This model predicts order effects based on the type of mental processing that is used for the new information. For end-of-sequence processing, or processing that occurs once all of the information has been presented, the model predicts primacy effects. The initial piece of information serves as the anchor, and subsequent pieces of information are aggregated together to adjust the initial piece of information. Therefore, the initial piece of information is weighted more than subsequent pieces of information, leading to a primacy effect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hogarth, R. M.|author2=Einhorn, H. J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1992|title=Order effects in belief updating: The belief-adjustment model|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=24|issue=1|pp=1–55|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(92)90002-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when processing changes to step-by-step processing, or processing that occurs after each new piece of information, recency effects are predicted. Each new piece of information received will be processed separately. This new piece of information will then become the new anchor, which forms a new impression. Beliefs are being adjusted with the processing of each new anchor, which leads to more weight being placed to the information most recently received. Therefore, recency effects are predicted to occur when information is processed in a step-by-step manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Factors that moderate order effects==

There are factors that can [[Moderation (statistics)|moderate]] the occurrence of order effects. Moderating factors affect the likelihood of order effects occurring.

===Need for cognition===

[[Need for cognition]] moderates the occurrence of order effects. Kassin, Reddy, and Tulloch (1990) demonstrated that a juror's need for cognition affects which order effect the juror relies on for their vote. An ambiguous confession was played by one side of the case, and then both sides commented that the confession fit into their narrative of the crime. The side who presented the confession spoke first. Jurors who had high need for cognition were more likely to exhibit a primacy effect, meaning that they believed the confession fit with whichever side presented the confession as evidence. Conversely, jurors who had low need for cognition demonstrated a recency effect, and believed that the confession supported the case for the side who did not submit the confession.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kassin, S. M.|author2=Reddy, M. E.|author3=Tulloch, W. F.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1990|title=Juror interpretations of ambiguous evidence: The need for cognition, presentation order, and persuasion|journal=Law and Human Behavior|volume=14|issue=1|pp=43–55|doi=10.1007/BF01055788|jstor=1393555|url=http://web.williams.edu/Psychology/Faculty/Kassin/files/Kassin_Reddy_Tulloch_1990.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kassin, Reddy, and Tulloch (1990) believed that the reason for this effect was due to the nature of processing that the jurors engaged in. Jurors who were high in need for cognition actively process the information. This active processing leads to agreeing with the initial presentation of the data, and then participating in processing that confirms this agreement. However, people low in need for cognition do not process information, and therefore, rely on the information presented most recently for their opinion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This impact of need for cognition is supported by a study conducted by Huagtvedt and Petty (1992). The experimenters played a message for two groups of people, one group that was high in need for cognition and one group that was low in need for cognition. The two groups were determined by their own need for cognition, and were not experimentally manipulated into the two groups. Initially, both groups were equally persuaded by the message. However, the two groups then listened to a weak counter-message, which was not as strong as the evidence for the initial message. The group that had high need for cognition were not persuaded by the weak counter-message, and their opinions were still in line with the initial message. The other group, the low need for cognition group, was persuaded by the new message. The high need for cognition demonstrated a primacy effect, while the low need for cognition demonstrated a recency effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Haugtvedt, C. P.|author2=Petty, R. E.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1992|title=Personality and persuasion: Need for cognition moderates the persistence and resistance of attitude changes|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=63|issue=2|p=308|url=http://psyc604.stasson.org/haugtvedt.pdf|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.2.308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chunking===
[[Chunking (psychology)|Chunking]] interacts with the order of information and need for cognition to moderate the occurrence of order effects. Petty, Tormala, Hawkins, and Wegener (2001) conducted a study which examined the effect chunking has on order effects in people with high and low need for cognition. Participants read arguments for and against an exam policy, and this information was presented as being either chunked or unchunked. When the information was chunked, those who show high need for cognition were prone to primacy effects, while those with low need for cognition were prone to recency effects. However, when the information was presented in an unchunked nature, the opposite results were found. People who had high need for cognition demonstrated recency effects, whereas people who had low need for cognition showed a primacy effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Petty, R. E.|author2=Tormala, Z. L.|author3=Hawkins, C.|author4=Wegener, D. T.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2001|title=Motivation to think and order effects in persuasion: The moderating role of chunking|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=27|issue=3|pp=332–344|doi=10.1177/0146167201273007|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247745085_Motivation_to_Think_and_Order_Effects_in_Persuasion_The_Moderating_Role_of_Chunking}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, chunking appears to interact with need for cognition to allow for order effects to occur.

===Familiarity of information===

A study conducted by Lana (1961) demonstrates a moderating effect of the familiarity of information presented on order effects. In the study, a topic of initial low familiarity was used. Then, the researchers presented a long talk to well familiarize one group with the topic and a short talk to another group to gain little familiarization with the topic. A third group was then presented with no familiarization talk. Each of these three groups was then split into two subgroups, which listened to arguments for and against the topic twelve days later. One subgroup would listen to the argument for the topic first and then the argument against the topic, and the second subgroup would listen to the argument against it first. These groups then filled out a [[Likert scale]] questionnaire on their opinions on the topic. The results show that prior familiarization with a topic increased the likelihood of a primacy effect. Therefore, those in the long familiarization group had an opinion on the topic that coincided with which argument they heard first, regardless of the actual stance. However, no prior familiarization led to a recency effect to be demonstrated. Therefore, the group that was given no familiarization talk demonstrated opinions that coincided with the argument presented last to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lana, R. E. |year=1961|title=Familiarity and the order of presentation of persuasive communications|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=62|issue=3|pp=573–577|doi=10.1037/h0046634|pmid=14461892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy of the topic===

A study conducted by Lana (1963) demonstrates that the controversiality of the topic can have a moderating effect on order effects. College students and high school students read arguments for and against a controversial topic and a noncontroversial topic, and were then asked to fill out an opinion questionnaire about the topics. For college students, the controversial topic exhibited a primacy effect. College students did not exhibit any order effects for a noncontroversial topic. The college students were persuaded more by the argument they encountered first for a controversial issue, but were not influenced by the order of the presentation of arguments for noncontroversial topics. However, for high school students, no order effects were exhibited for either the controversial or noncontroversial topics. Therefore, the controversy of a topic appears to affect the role order effects play for some age groups in persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lana, Robert E.|year=1963|title=Controversy of the topic and the order of presentation in persuasive communications|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=12|issue=1|pp=163–170|doi=10.2466/pr0.1963.12.1.163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order effects in judgment formation==

===Sports===

Smith, Greenlees, and Manley (2009) found that order effects can occur in assessment of sports ability. The researchers had participants watch a video composed of an [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate Frisbee]] player performing certain skills. Two videos were shown, either in descending ability or increasing ability. The participants were then asked to make assessments of the overall ability of the players and three aspects of their ability. However, the assessments occurred at differing times in the video. One group made the assessments at the end of the video, one group made delayed assessments at the end of the video, a third group made the assessments after each skill in the video, and a fourth group that made the overall assessment after each skill but then made the assessment of the ability after viewing the entire video. Results indicate that a primacy effect was exhibited in each of the conditions, except for the third group, which did not demonstrate any order effects. The assessment of ability tended to agree with the initial ability level shown. However, the group that made assessments in an extended step-by-step manner were not influenced by the order the abilities were shown. Therefore, a primacy effect can occur in ability assessment, unless extended step-by-step processing is employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, M. J.|author2=Greenlees, I.|author3=Manley, A.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=Influence of order effects and mode of judgement on assessments of ability in sport|journal=Journal of Sports Sciences|volume=27|issue=7|pp=745–752|doi=10.1080/02640410902939647|pmid=19437187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service encounters===

In a study conducted by Garnefeld and Steinhoff (2013), order effects were demonstrated for opinions regarding service encounters. Four groups received daily descriptions of a hypothetical hotel stay over the course of five days. One group had a very positive experience on the first day, and then a neutral to slightly positive experience for the rest of the days. The second group had a negative experience on the first day, and then a neutral to slightly positive experience for the rest of the stay. Groups three and four experienced a neutral experience for the first four days, with group three then having a positive experience on the last day and group four having a negative experience on the last day. Each group was then tested for customer satisfaction regarding their hypothetical stay. Garnefeld and Steinhoff found that the timing of positive or negative occurrences is what affected satisfaction. For negative events, a recency effect was demonstrated, meaning that negative events which occurred at the end of the stay affected customer satisfaction more than negative events at the beginning of the stay. For positive events, a primacy effect was demonstrated, which means that positive events that occurred at the beginning of the stay affected customer satisfaction more than positive events at the end of the stay. Therefore, the timing of particular types of events in extended service encounters predicts the effect of the event on satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Garnefeld, I.|author2=Steinhoff, L.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2013|title=Primacy versus recency effects in extended service encounters|journal=Journal of Service Management|volume=24|issue=1|pp=64–81|doi=10.1108/09564231311304198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order effects in health care==

Order effects may be used to influence a patient to receive an effective treatment that aligns with their values. One study, conducted by Bansback, Li, Lynd, and Bryan (2014), demonstrates that a primacy effect will influence the decision for treatment. The researchers presented three groups with information about sleep apnea treatments. The three groups were based on the order in which the information was presented. One group received information in an order unrelated to their values, while two groups received information ordered based on their values. One of the groups received information that aligned with their values first, and the other group received information that aligned with their values last. The researchers found that patients were more likely to choose the treatment that aligned with their values when this information was presented first, thus demonstrating a primacy effect for information on treatments that align with a patient's values. The order in which patients receive information appears to influence which treatment option they choose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bansback, N.|author2=Li L. C.|author3=Lynd, L.|author4=Bryan S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2014|title=Exploiting order effects to improve  the quality of decisions|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|volume=96|issue=2|pp=197–203|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2014.05.021|pmid=24961445|url=http://www.pec-journal.com/article/S0738-3991(14)00226-2/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order effects in politics==
===Voter mobilization===

In a study conducted by Panagopoulos (2010), order effects were found in terms of voter mobilization. Calls were made to residents of an American city at different times before an election. Some residents received a call 4 weeks prior to an election, some received a call two weeks prior to an election, some received a call three days before an election, and some residents did not receive a call. The call made was a nonpartisan attempt to mobilize people to vote. Results indicate that the timing of the call may not have an effect on the general voter population, but that the timing can affect certain populations and get certain populations to vote at higher rates. According to Panagopoulos, high-propensity voters, voters who typically turn out in higher numbers, voted at higher percentages when they received the call four weeks prior to the election, demonstrating a primacy effect. However, for lower propensity voters, voters who typically do not vote, calls made three days prior to the election were more effective at getting this population to vote, demonstrating a recency effect. Therefore, for voter mobilization, propensity to vote appears to be a moderating variable influencing the effect of timing of a mobilization call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Panagopoulos, C.|year=2011|title=Timing Is Everything?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15494">'''Life chances''' (''Lebenschancen'' in [[German language|German]]) is a social science theory of the [[wikt:opportunity|opportunities]] each individual has to improve their quality of life. The concept was introduced by German sociologist [[Max Weber]]. It is a [[probabilistic]] concept, describing how likely it is, given certain factors, that an individual's life will turn out a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;(Hughes 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, life chances are positively [[correlation|correlated]] with one's [[socioeconomic status]].&lt;ref name=black&gt;Blackwell, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Opportunities in this sense refer to the extent to which one has access to resources, both tangible ones such as food, clothing and shelter, and intangible ones such as education and health care.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Life chances comprise the individual's ability to procure [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]], have a [[career]] and obtain inner satisfaction; in other words, the ability to satisfy one's [[needs]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Cuneo, [http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/soc/courses/soc2r3/weber/weberidx.htm Max Weber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909161957/http://socserv2.mcmaster.ca/soc/courses/soc2r3/weber/weberidx.htm |date=2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Weberian life chances can be seen as an expansion on some of functionalist [[Karl Marx]]'s ideas. Both Weber and Marx agreed that economic factors were important in determining one's future, but Weber's concepts of life chances are more complex; inspired by, but different from Marx's views on [[social stratification]] and [[social class]]. Where for Marx the [[class status]] was the most important factor, and he correlated life chances with material wealth, Weber introduced such additional factors as [[social mobility]] and [[social equality]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowenna Harrison, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080607140427/http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/CURRIC/soc/lowerSixthA.htm Is an unstratified society possible?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/life_chances/index.asp Life Chances and Social Mobility] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916023204/http://www.strategy.gov.uk/work_areas/life_chances/index.asp |date=2006-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors include those related to one's socioeconomic status, such as [[gender]], [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], and [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref name=ffg&gt;Kevin Fitzpatrick, Mark La Gory, ''Unhealthy places: the ecology of risk in the urban landscape'', Psychology Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-415-92372-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415923727&amp;id=Mh0ZV5fl2cAC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=%22Life+chances%22+Weber&amp;sig=-NoWukzqbmGuxhbpmxpbb402R-4 Google Print, p.90-91]&lt;/ref&gt;

While some of those factors, like age, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[gender]], are random,&lt;ref name=ffg/&gt; Weber stressed the link between life chances and the non-random elements of the three-component theory of stratification&amp;nbsp;– how [[social class]], [[social status]] and [[political affiliation]] affect each individual's life. In other words, individuals in certain [[group (sociology)|groups]] have in common a specific [[causal]] component of their life chances: they are in similar situation, which tends to imply a similar outcome to their actions. Weber notes the importance of [[economic]] factors:&lt;ref&gt;William C. Cockerham ''Health and social change in [[Russia]] and Eastern Europe
'', Routledge, 1999, {{ISBN|0-415-92081-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415920809&amp;id=GOZFhIBmN1gC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Life+chances%22+Weber&amp;sig=oWGnkOVVG5Ih1IjPG0__6J4t5R8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msop&gt;[http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/o2302.htm Multiple Sources of Power&amp;nbsp;– Class, Status, and Party]&lt;/ref&gt; how the [[power (sociology)|power]] of those with [[property]], compared to those without property, gives the former great advantages over the latter.&lt;ref name=msop/&gt;

Weber also noted that life chances are to certain extent [[Subjectivity|subjective]]: one's assessment of one's life chances will affect one's actions; therefore, if one believes that one is or can become a respected and valued member of [[society]], that outcome and associated positive results are more likely to become a reality for such a person than they are for one without this conviction.&lt;ref name=hewett&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080607123432/http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/CURRIC/soc/weber/wclass.htm Weber and Class].&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons without such a belief, especially those who consciously espouse or have unconsciously internalized a belief to the contrary, are vulnerable to [[learned helplessness]] and its long-term effects.

In terms of [[agency and structure]], life chances represent the structure, the factors that one has no control over; whereas one's [[life conduct]] - values and beliefs, attitude to risk taking, social skills, or more generally, [[free will]]ed choices about one's [[behavior]] - represent the factors one has control over.&lt;ref name=ffg/&gt; According to Weber theories, together with life conduct, life chances are responsible for one's [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].&lt;ref name=black/&gt;

In [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]], life chances may have to be balanced against other goals, such as eliminating [[poverty]], ensuring [[Freedom (political)|personal freedom]] or ensuring equality at birth.

==Ascriptive qualities==
The life chances approach suggests that status is not entirely [[Achieved status|achieved]], but is, to some extent, [[Ascribed status|ascribed]]. Overall, in societies emphasizing [[ascription]], opportunity is relatively low and status (in the sense of prestige in the community) is often inherited.
This means that people are, effectively, given their status as a result of the group into which they are born, rather than earning it entirely on merit.&lt;ref name="curriculum-press.co.uk"&gt;Yeates, Nicola. "Sociology Factsheet&amp;nbsp;– Life Chances."www.curriculum-press.co.uk. Bank House, n.d. Web. 14 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ascriptive qualities such as [[Race (human classification)|race]]/[[ethnicity]], [[gender]], and [[Social class|class]] of origin can all affect one's life chances. In all societies parents pass on whatever advantages and disadvantages they have to their children.&lt;ref name="Beeghley, Leonard 2008"&gt;Beeghley, Leonard. "Sociology and Stratification." The Structure of Social Stratification in the United States. 5th ed. N.p.: Pearson Education, 2008. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

A persons’ class of origin determines one's neighborhood they live in, which in turn will affect [[educational attainment]], the people they socialize with, and ultimately their [[class identification]]. A very important factor affecting life chances is housing. Poorer housing will affect health, available facilities, the likelihood of being a victim of crime, and many other aspects of life. Leisure facilities are often located in middle class areas or near non manual work places. Gym membership is expensive and subsidies are rarely available for lower grade staff. Therefore, in general, the middle and upper classes have far greater life chances available than the less advantaged groups.&lt;ref name="curriculum-press.co.uk"/&gt;

If born into a [[wealthy]] family a person will have access to far more desirable resources that can assist them in further enhancing their life chances to a far greater extent than someone who is born into a [[working class]] poor family. One of these resources includes a family's [[social ties]] and the ability for a person with well connected parents to benefit greatly in the status attainment process. [[Status attainment]] refers to how each individual enters an occupation. This encompasses how both ascribed and achieved factors combine, because each individual enters an occupation based on the way their parents’ status produces advantages and disadvantages, their own efforts and abilities, and a degree of luck.&lt;ref name="Beeghley, Leonard 2008"/&gt;

An additional dimension is the effect of family dynamics on life chances, such as the presence of biological parents, the quality of family relationships, and sibling configuration. For example, it has been demonstrated that children of divorced parents exhibit lower levels of psychological well-being, more problems in their own relationship, a greater risk of experiencing divorce, and also tend to be less educated.&lt;ref&gt;Gugushvili, Alexi. Ascriptive Inequality and Life Chances in Georgia. www.css.ge. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Nov. 2013. [http://www.eui.eu/Personal/Researchers/AlexiGugushvili/sept._2012_ENG.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overcoming bad life chances==
[[Max Weber]] discussed the effects of [[social stratification]] on life chances. He argued that life chances are opportunities and possibilities that make up one's [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Life chances are affected by a number of factors. Some of which include: [[income]], [[social class]], and [[occupational prestige]]. These factors all affect the availability of resources to an individual. For example, when one has low income, they have low life chances. Their education may not be as great and they may not have a high enough income to attain an advanced level of education.&lt;ref&gt;White, Kevin. "life chances." The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology. Ed. Bryan S. Turner. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, 2006. 338. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 14 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Wout Ultee, education is a major aspect of overcoming life chances.&lt;ref name="blackwellreference.com"&gt;Ultee, Wout. "Life Chances and Resources." Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. Ritzer, George (ed). Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Blackwell Reference Online. 15 November 2013 [http://www.blackwellreference.com/subscriber/tocnode.html?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g978140512433118_ss1-43]&lt;/ref&gt;  Without an education, it is harder to obtain a job that provides a substantial income to provide for a family of four. “Higher education is the way to stay ahead."&lt;ref name="blackwellreference.com"/&gt; The higher the education, the higher income and [[occupational prestige]] one will have, which results in more resources for an individual and his family.

Early [[Health intervention|intervention]] is also necessary in improving life chances. Save the Children is a non-governmental group that works in the best interest of children. They promote children's rights and the aid children in [[underdeveloped]] countries that need relief. The UK has started an early intervention program that aids in improving life chances early on a child's life. They believe that "No child should endure poverty and no child's life chances should be shaped by the accident of birth."&lt;ref&gt;"Early Intervention Review." Save the Children. Save the Children, Nov. 2010. Web. 17 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This program was made to ensure that [[Educational inequality|inequalities]] in children's learning are tackled before problems can occur and separate them from peers. In order to do so, this program gives parents in lower classes the expertise they need to effectively help their children's learning in a home environment so that they are well prepared when they enter school. An example would be improving the parents' reading level so that they are able to teach their children how to read and write before kindergarten. This allows children in lower classes to be near the same level as children who are in higher classes with higher educated parents. Early intervention will allow for children to start out their education on the right foot, with skills they will need to succeed and achieve a high level of education, thus improving life chances.

==Class identification and lifestyle effects==
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2018}}
Weber noted that life chances are partially determined by [[Subjectivity|subjective]] factors, such as by how one perceives their life chances. How one [[perceives]] their life chances is in large part determined by what one perceives their [[social class]] to be since life chances and social class go hand in hand and both [[reinforce]] each other. According to Weber this is because life chances are largely determined by economic factors such as social class. The phenomenon of how you perceive things actually affecting the [[tangible]] outcomes of life chances is explained by [[Robert K. Merton]]'s theory of "self fulfilling prophecy" which he discusses in his book Social Theory and Social Structure. Essentially what it means is that individuals can tell themselves something like, "I'm lower class, my family has always been lower class, there's no chance I'm ever going to be well off" and although this statement had the potential to not end up being true, it became true simply because the individual believed it would be so and through his attitude and lack of self-esteem, made it his reality.

If you identify as low social class and believe you are most likely never going to be anything else, this will affect your life conduct in a myriad of ways. which in turn will affect your life chances. For one, the company you keep can lead to you networking with people that will not help you get out of a low socioeconomic environment. It can also affect your life conduct by making you think you are not qualified enough for anything but [[working class]] jobs. It can also affect your life conduct by making you think that pursuing higher education is not for someone of your social standing, further ensuring that you never get above working class work. The relationship between social class, life conduct, and life chances is a strong one that often decides what a person's fate in life will be like.

The '''portrayal of transgender people in the media''' list includes portrayals of [[transgender people]] and many other non-[[cisgender]] identities in the [[mass media]].

==Terminology==
[[Transgender]] (trans) is the state of one's [[gender identity]] or gender expression not matching one's [[Sex assignment|assigned sex]]. Transgender men are people [[Sex assignment|assigned]] female at birth who identify as men. Transgender women are people [[Sex assignment|assigned]] male at birth who identify as women. Some gender nonconforming people do not [[Gender identity|identify]] with either male or female. [[Cisgender]] men and women are individuals whose gender experiences conform to the sex assigned to them at birth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22272">In [[music cognition]] and [[musical analysis]], the study of '''melodic expectation''' considers the engagement of the brain's predictive mechanisms in response to music.&lt;ref name="Margulis2007"/&gt; For example, if the ascending musical partial [[octave]] "do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-..." is heard, listeners familiar with Western music will have a strong expectation to hear or provide one more note, "do", to complete the octave.

Melodic expectation can be considered at the [[Esthesic and poietic|esthesic level]],&lt;ref name="Nattiez1990"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jean-Jacques Nattiez | publisher  =Princeton University Press  |date= 1992 |title=Music and Discourse: Toward a Semiology of Music (Musicologie générale et sémiologie), translated by Carolyn Abbate | isbn=978-0-691-02714-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which case the focus lies on the listener and its response to music.&lt;ref name="Margulis2007"/&gt; It can be considered at the [[neutral level]],&lt;ref name="Nattiez1990"/&gt; in which case the focus switches to the actual musical content, such as the "printed notes themselves".&lt;ref name="EN1992"/&gt; At the neutral level, the observer may consider logical implications projected onto future elements by past elements&lt;ref name="EN1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "SC5"/&gt; or derive statistical observations from [[information theory]].&lt;ref name="Youngblood1958"/&gt;

==A multifaceted concept==

The notion of melodic expectation has prompted the existence of a corpus of studies in which authors often choose to provide their own terminology in place of using the literature's.&lt;ref name = "SC5"/&gt; This results in an important number of different terms that all point towards the phenomenon of musical expectation:&lt;ref name = "SC5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MMF2006"&gt;{{cite web |author=Morwaread M.

Expectation can also be found mentioned in relation to concepts originating from the field of [[information theory]] such as [[entropy]].&lt;ref name="Youngblood1958"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer1957"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Abdallah2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hiller1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knopoff1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Margulis2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Snyder1990"/&gt;
Hybridization of information theory and humanities results in the birth of yet other notions, particularly variations upon the notion of entropy modified for the need of description of musical content.&lt;ref name="Culpepper2010"&gt;{{cite web |author=Sarah E.

Consideration of musical expectation can be sorted into four trends.&lt;ref name = "SC5"/&gt;

* A first trend may include publications written in the 1950s by Meyer, Younblood and Krahenbuehl &amp; Coons that are concerned with objectivization and rationalization of the concepts of arousal, uncertainty, or non-confirmation of a prediction using information theory.&lt;ref name="Youngblood1958"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer1957"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krahenbuehl1959"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=David Krahenbuehl  |author2=Edgar Coons  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher  =Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, XVII/4   |date=1959 |title= Information as a measure of experience in music|jstor=428224  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A second trend may concern the more recent publications that include a step-by-step music analysis process at the neutral level, such as the [[generative theory of tonal music]]&lt;ref name="GTTM"/&gt; and Narmour's [[Implication-Realization]] model.&lt;ref name="EN1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EN1990"/&gt;
* A third trend may provide quantitative models based on computer algorithms, such as Margulis' model of melodic expectation or Farbood's model of musical tension.&lt;ref name="MMF2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EHM2005"/&gt;
* A fourth trend may group generalist theories whose focus lies neither in step-by-step processes nor in quantitative operations, and may include elements pertinent to the esthesic level such as cognition and neurophysiology. This includes Larson's "musical forces"&lt;ref name="Larson2005"/&gt; and Huron's theory of general expectation.&lt;ref name="Huron2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Huron | publisher  =M.I.T. Press  |date=2006  |title=Sweet anticipation: music and the psychology of expectation | isbn= 9780262582780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leonard Meyer ==

[[Leonard B. Meyer|Leonard Meyer]]'s ''Emotion and Meaning in Music''&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonard B. Meyer | publisher  = Chicago University Press |date=1956 | title= Emotion and Meaning in Music |isbn=978-0-226-52139-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the classic text in music expectation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Meyer's starting point is the belief that the experience of music (as a listener) is derived from one's emotions and feelings about the music, which themselves are a function of relationships within the music itself.  Meyer writes that listeners bring with them a vast body of musical experiences that, as one listens to a piece, conditions one's response to that piece as it unfolds.  Meyer argued that music's evocative power derives from its capacity to generate, suspend, prolongate, or violate these expectations.

Meyer models listener expectation in two levels.  On a perceptual level, Meyer draws on [[Gestalt psychology]] to explain how listeners build mental representations of auditory phenomena.  Above this raw perceptual level, Meyer argues that learning shapes (and re-shapes) one's expectations over time.

== Implication-Realization model ==
{{main|Implication-Realization}}
Narmour's (1992) Implication-Realization (I-R) Model is a detailed formalization based on Meyer's work on expectation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} A fundamental difference between Narmour's models and most theories of expectation lies in the author's conviction according to which a genuine theory should be formulated in falsifiable terms. According to Narmour, prior knowledge of musical expectation is based too heavily upon percepts, introspection and internalization, which bring insoluble epistemological problems.&lt;ref name="EN1992"/&gt; The theory focuses on how ''implicative intervals'' set up expectations for certain ''realizations'' to follow. The [[Implication-Realization|I-R]] model includes two primary factors: proximity and direction.&lt;ref name="EN1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EN1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EGS1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author=E.

* while Narmour's two fundamental hypotheses address the relations between three elements,&lt;ref name="EN1990"/&gt; the fundamental hypotheses leading to the S&amp;C model address the relations between four elements.

Margulis's 2005 model&lt;ref name="EHM2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Elizabeth H. Margulis |date=2005 | title= A model of melodic expectation | journal  = Music Perception: An Interdisciplinary Journal |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=663–714 | doi  = 10.1525/mp.2005.22.4.663 }}&lt;/ref&gt; further extends the I-R model.  First, Margulis added a melodic attraction factor, from some of Lerdahl's work.  Second, while the I-R model relies on a single (local) interval to establish an implication (an expectation), Margulis attempts to model intervalic (local) expectation as well as more deeply schematic (global) expectation.  For this, Margulis relies on Lerdahl's and Jackendoff's GTTM&lt;ref name="GTTM"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fred Lerdhal  |author2=Ray Jackendoff  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher  = MIT Press |date=1983 | title= A Generative Theory of Tonal Music |isbn=978-0-262-62107-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide a time-span reduction.  At each hierarchical level (a different time scale) in the reduction, Margulis applies her model.  These separate levels of analysis are combined through averaging, with each level weighted according to values derived from the time-span reduction.  Finally, Margulis's model is explicit and realizable, and yields quantitative output. The output - melodic expectation at each time instant - is a single function of time.

Margulis's model describes three distinct types of listener reactions, each derived from listener-experienced ''tension'':
*Surprise-Tension: inversely proportional to degree of expectancy; results in intensity or dynamism.
*Denial-Tension: proportional to the discrepancy between the expectancy of the most expected event and the expectancy of the actually perceived event; results in desire, drive, will.
*Expectancy-Tension: proportional to the degree of expectancy of the most expected event (in other words, if the listener had no idea what to expect next, the expectancy-tension would be low); results in strain or yearning.&lt;ref name="MMF2006"/&gt;

[https://www.bu.edu/av/core/journal/xxiii/Aruffo.pdf "Problems with the Noble Lie."] ''Boston University''.  Accessed 4 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[politics]], a '''noble lie''' is a [[myth]] or [[Lie|untruth]], often, but not invariably, of a religious nature, knowingly propagated by an [[elite]] to maintain social harmony or to advance an agenda. The noble lie is a concept originated by [[Plato]] as described in the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.

In [[religion]], a '''pious fiction''' is a narrative that is presented as true by the author, but is considered by others to be fictional albeit produced with an altruistic motivation. The term is sometimes used [[pejorative]]ly to suggest that the author of the narrative was deliberately misleading readers for selfish or deceitful reasons. The term is often used in religious contexts, sometimes referring to passages in religious texts.

==Plato's ''Republic''==
[[File:P. Oxy. LII 3679.jpg|thumb|P. Oxy. 3679, manuscript from the 3rd century AD, containing fragments of Plato's Republic.]]
{{main|The Republic (Plato)}}
Plato presented the Noble Lie (γενναῖον ψεῦδος, ''gennaion pseudos'' – literally, "a lie or wrong opinion about origin") in the fictional tale known as the myth or parable of the metals. In it, Socrates provides the origin of the three [[social class]]es who compose the republic proposed by Plato; Socrates speaks of a [[Social stratification|socially stratified society]], wherein the populace are told "a sort of Phoenician tale":

{{Quotation|...the earth, as being their mother, delivered them, and now, as if their land were their mother and their nurse, they ought to take thought for her and defend her against any attack, and regard the other citizens as their brothers and children of the self-same earth...While all of you, in the city, are brothers, we will say in our tale, yet god, in fashioning those of you who are fitted to hold rule, mingled gold in their generation, for which reason they are the most precious—but in the helpers, silver, and iron and brass in the farmers and other craftsmen. And, as you are all akin, though for the most part you will breed after your kinds, it may sometimes happen that a golden father would beget a silver son, and that a golden offspring would come from a silver sire, and that the rest would, in like manner, be born of one another. So that the first and chief injunction that the god lays upon the rulers is that of nothing else are they to be such careful guardians, and so intently observant as of the intermixture of these metals in the souls of their offspring, and if sons are born to them with an infusion of brass or iron they shall by no means give way to pity in their treatment of them, but shall assign to each the status due to his nature and thrust them out among the artisans or the farmers. And again, if from these there is born a son with unexpected gold or silver in his composition they shall honor such and bid them go up higher, some to the office of guardian, some to the assistanceship, alleging that there is an oracle that the city shall then be overthrown when the man of iron or brass is its guardian.&lt;ref&gt;Book 3, 414e–15c&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Socrates proposes and claims that if the people believed "this myth...[it] would have a good effect, making them more inclined to care for the state and one another."&lt;ref&gt;Book 3, 415c–d&lt;/ref&gt; This is his ''noble lie'': "a contrivance for one of those falsehoods that come into being in case of need, of which we were just now talking, some noble one..."&lt;ref&gt;414b–c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern views==

===Karl Popper===
[[File:Karl Popper2.jpg|right|thumb|Sir Karl Popper in 1990]]
{{main article|Karl Popper}}
Karl Popper accused Plato of trying to base religion on a noble lie as well. In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Popper remarks, "It is hard to understand why those of Plato's commentators who praise him for fighting against the subversive conventionalism of the Sophists, and for establishing a spiritual naturalism ultimately based on religion, fail to censure him for making a convention, or rather an invention, the ultimate basis of religion." Religion for Plato is a noble lie, at least if we assume that Plato meant all of this sincerely, not cynically. Popper finds Plato's conception of religion to have been very influential in subsequent thought.&lt;ref name="popper"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071209060939/http://www.positiveliberty.com/2007/07/open-society-vi-on-religion-as-a-noble-lie.html Positive Liberty » Open Society VI: On Religion as a Noble Lie&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leo Strauss===

{{main article|Leo Strauss}}
Strauss noted that thinkers of the first rank, going back to Plato, had raised the problem of whether good and effective politicians could be completely truthful and still achieve the necessary ends of their society. By implication, Strauss asks his readers to consider whether it is true that noble lies have no role at all to play in uniting and guiding the [[polis]]. Are myths needed to give people meaning and purpose and to ensure a stable society? Or can men dedicated to relentlessly examining, in [[Nietzsche]]'s language, those "deadly truths," flourish freely? Thus, is there a limit to the political, and what can be known absolutely? In ''The City and Man,'' Strauss discusses the myths outlined in [[The Republic (Plato)|Plato's ''Republic'']] that are required for all governments. These include a belief that the state's land belongs to it even though it was likely acquired illegitimately and that citizenship is rooted in something more than the accidents of birth. Seymour Hersh also claims that Strauss endorsed noble lies: myths used by political leaders seeking to maintain a cohesive society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M. Hersh]], [http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?030512fa_fact "Selective Intelligence"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', May 12, 2003, accessed June 1, 2007.{{Dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;Brian Doherty, [http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml "Origin of the Specious: Why Do Neoconservatives Doubt Darwin?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725170209/http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml |date=2008-07-25 }}, ''[[Reason Online]]'', July 1997, accessed February 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]'', documentary filmmaker [[Adam Curtis]] opines that "Strauss believed it was for politicians to assert powerful and inspiring myths that everyone could believe in. They might not be true, but they were necessary illusions. One of these was religion; the other was the myth of the nation."&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise of the Politics of Fear''; Episode 1: "Baby It's Cold Outside"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desmond Lee===

{{main article|Desmond Lee}}
"Plato has been criticized for his Foundation Myth as if it were a calculated lie. That is partly because the phrase here translated 'magnificent myth' (p.414b) has been conventionally mistranslated 'noble lie'; and this has been used to support the charge that Plato countenances manipulation by propaganda. But the myth is accepted by all three classes, Guardians included. It is meant to replace the national traditions which any community has, which are intended to express the kind of community it is, or wishes to be, its ideals, rather than to state matters of fact."&lt;ref name="Plato p177"&gt;Plato: The Republic, Penguin Classics, translated by Desmond Lee, p177&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea of Faith===

{{main article|Sea of Faith}}
The Sea of Faith Network (SoF) aims are "Exploring and promoting religious faith as a human creation..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofn.org.uk/ Sea of Faith homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although arguably not an organisation ''based'' on the noble lie, many of their members no longer believe, but continue to espouse religious beliefs for positive social control and continue to hold positions in many religious organizations and various church groups.

* [[historical method|Mainstream historical interpretations]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (i.e. the [[Tanakh]] or the [[Protestant]] [[Old Testament]]) often consider much of the Tanakh/Jewish Bible to be a pious fiction, such as the conquests of Joshua,&lt;ref&gt;Borras, Judit, ''Jewish Studies at the Turn of the Twentieth Century'', BRILL, 1999, p 117: ".. the overwhelming consensus of modern scholarship is that the conquest tradition of [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] is a pious fiction composed by the deuteronomistic school …"&lt;/ref&gt; and the histories of the [[Pentateuch]].&lt;ref&gt;https://peteenns.com/briefly-3-edgy-things-old-testament-works/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://peteenns.com/3-things-i-would-like-to-see-evangelical-leaders-stop-saying-about-biblical-scholarship/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Christopher, The Hebrew Bible: A Comparative Approach'', Fortress Press, 2009, p 123: "Minimalists begin with the fact that the [[Hebrew Bible]] did not reach its present form until well after the [[Babylonian exile]] … most the that the story was formulated by a group of elites who wanted to justify their claims to dominate … In other words, the narrative [of the Hebrew Bible] is a pious fiction that bears little relation to the actual history of Palestine during the period it purports to narrate."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Book of Daniel]] has also been described as a pious fiction, with the purpose of providing encouragement to Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, D. A. For the Love of God: A Daily Companion for Discovering the Riches of God's Word'', Good News Publishers, 2006, p 19: "Many critics doubt that the account of [[The Book of Daniel|Daniel 4]] is anything more than pious fiction to encourage the Jews."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mainstream historical-critical approaches often views stories in the New Testament such as [[Nativity of Jesus|the Virgin Birth]], [[the Visit of the Magi to Jesus]], and others, as pious fictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Testament in the Twentieth Century|last=Jones|first=Maurice|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In the Depression era, a great many Americans, north and south of the border, succumbed to the pious fiction that underlay the Krausist-Areilist-Marxist nonmaterial rewards aspect of good neighborliness… Without the occasional seasoning of pious fictions, concocted by intellectuals who in their delusions of grandeur try to introduce elements of dream live into crude reality, might not the real world be a far more vicious jungle than it is?"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto Kirchheimer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkɪɐ̯çˌhaɪmɐ|lang}}; 11 November 1905, [[Heilbronn]] – 22 November 1965, [[New York City]]) was a [[Germany|German]] jurist of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish ancestry]] and political scientist of the [[Frankfurt School]] whose work essentially covered the [[State (polity)|state]] and its [[constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arzt |first=Donna E. |chapter=Otto Kirchheimer: Critic of the Administration of Justice |title=Der Einfluß deutscher Emigranten auf die Rechtsentwicklung in den USA und in Deutschland |editor-last=Lutter |editor-first=Marcus |year=1993 |location=Tübingen |publisher=Mohr |isbn=3-16-146080-4 |pages=33–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchheimer worked as a research analyst at the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), the forerunner of the [[CIA]], starting in [[World War II]] and continuing to 1952.&lt;ref name="oss"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9955.html |title=Secret Reports on Nazi Germany: The Frankfurt School Contribution to the War Effort |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
He is father of the concept of a "[[big tent|catch-all party]] (''Allerweltspartei'')". Otto Kirchheimer's conception of the catch-all party was part of his more comprehensive theory of party transformation, encompassing four interrelated political processes. By tracing the development of the catch-all thesis and placing it within the wider context of Kirchheimer's complete work, it is possible to reconstruct a more precise understanding of what Kirchheimer meant by the catch-all concept, which itself remains highly contested. Kirchheimer's anxiety about modern democracy originated with what he saw as the vanishing of principled opposition within parliament and society, and the reduction of politics to the mere management of the state. This leads to collusion of political parties and the state, severing of the societal links of party organisations, and erosion of the classic separation of powers. Vanishing opposition, cartelisation and professionalisation of politics pits citizens against a powerful state, which increases political cynicism and apathy. Kirchheimer's comprehensive approach remains relevant to much of the contemporary debate about the transformation of Western political systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krouwel|first=André|title=Otto Kirchheimer and the Catch-all Party|journal=West European Politics|year=2003|volume=26|issue=2|page=23|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01402380512331341091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Research Fund (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) is funding the research and editorial work for an edition in five volumes of the ''Gesammelte Schriften'' (Collected Writings) of Otto Kirchheimer. The project began in late 2015 at [[Greifswald University]] and is scheduled to take about three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://buchstein.wordpress.com/forschung|title=Prof. Dr. Hubertus Buchstein|website=Greifswald University|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Palm Center''' is a [[think tank]] founded in 1998 at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], that produces scholarship designed to improve the quality of public dialogue about critical and controversial [[public policy]] issues. It commissions and disseminates research in the areas of gender, sexuality, and the military that has been published in leading social scientific journals and cited in the press. The Palm Center is a resource for university-affiliated as well as independent scholars, students, journalists, opinion leaders, and members of the public.

At its founding in 1998, it was known as the Center for the Study of [[Sexual minorities|Sexual Minorities]] in the Military. It was renamed in 2006 in recognition of a one million dollar endowment gift from the Michael D. Palm Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;''Chronoicle of Philanthropy'': [http://philanthropy.com/article/Philanthropys-Military/128431/ Anthony Bowen and Andrew Lane, "End of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” Is a Victory for Philanthropy," July 26, 2011], accessed February 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Palm Center's research has been cited on the floor of Congress and covered by newspapers and radio and television stations throughout the world. Palm scholars have delivered briefings and lectures at the [[British Ministry of Defence]], the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, the [[United States Naval Academy]], the [[United States Air Force Academy]], the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]] and the [[National Defense University]].

'''''The Periodic Table of Videos''''' (usually shortened to '''''Periodic Videos''''') is a series of videos about [[chemical elements]] and the [[periodic table]]. They are published on [[YouTube]] and produced by [[Brady Haran]], a former [[BBC]] video journalist, featuring Sir [[Martyn Poliakoff]] ("The Professor"), Peter Licence, [[Stephen Liddle]], Debbie Kays, Neil Barnes, Sam Tang and others at the [[University of Nottingham]].&lt;ref name="arstechnica"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2008/07/periodic-table-brought-to-life.ars |title=Periodic Table brought to life |author=Jonathan M. Gitlin |date=July 16, 2008|publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The project began recording on 9 June 2008 and the initial videos were completed on 17 July 2008.&lt;ref name="professor1" /&gt; The collection includes videos, each just a few minutes long, for all 118 known elements with a video for each element, as well as many additional supplemental chemistry videos. The 118 element videos and introduction videos were all shot unscripted in June and July 2008.&lt;ref name="acs08" /&gt;

Since the initial videos were completed in 2008 the team has been refining and uploading revised versions of the videos with new video and in higher resolutions.&lt;ref name="acs08" /&gt; A key example of this revising is with the [[xenon]] video that was redone in honour of professor [[Neil Bartlett (chemist)|Neil Bartlett]] who died on 5 August 2008;&lt;ref name="acs08" /&gt; Bartlett prepared one of the first xenon compounds, [[xenon hexafluoroplatinate]].&lt;ref name="acs08" /&gt;

==Content==
Poliakoff is the most visible presenter on the videos and his hair, reminiscent of [[Einstein]] or a [[mad scientist]], is frequently commented upon in the videos.&lt;ref name="acs08"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/staff/biosr.html Ritter, Stephen]|title = Elements Achieve Internet Stardom|journal = [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]|volume = 86|issue = 37|pages = 42–43|publisher = [[American Chemical Society]]|date = September 15, 2008|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/education/86/8637education.html|accessdate = July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of the professor's hair and amusing experiments has made these videos quite popular.&lt;ref name="acs08"/&gt; Although uncertain what to think about the attention given to his hair, Professor Poliakoff is excited with the success of the videos, stating "With a few hours of work, I have lectured to more students than I have reached in my entire career."&lt;ref name="acs08"/&gt; The YouTube channel as of December 2017, has over 1 million subscribers and the videos have surpassed 170 million views.&lt;ref name="professor1"&gt;{{Cite video|people = Brady Haran (producer)|title = The Professor talks about The Periodic Table of Videos|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yT8kvHlgeg|publisher = The Periodic Table of Videos|location = Nottingham, UK|date = 31 May 2010|accessdate  = 17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YouTube"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/periodicvideos |title=Periodic Table of Videos Channel |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The YouTube channel is now one of the most popular chemistry related channels on all of YouTube.&lt;ref name="EPSRCvideo"/&gt; The producers of the videos have received praise from Nobel Laureates, chemistry professors, and the general public, says Professor Poliakoff.&lt;ref name="acs08"/&gt; Chemistry Nobel Laureate [[Roald Hoffmann]] has even offered his praise of the videos, stating they "are like the best reality show I've ever seen – the universe revealing itself, element by element."&lt;ref name="acs08"/&gt;

The videos feature various experiments and demonstrations of the elements, some too dangerous to be performed in a classroom.&lt;ref name="acs08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/7507986.stm |title=Elements brought to life online |author=Staff |date=15 July 2008 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the presenters take appropriate precautions when doing such experiments and provide adequate warnings, some scientists have criticized the dangerous experiments fearing people might try them at home and get hurt.&lt;ref name="acs08"/&gt; The intent of the videos is to bring chemistry to a new generation of students and to get them enthused about science and understand how chemists think and what chemists are trying to do.&lt;ref name="cbs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3347317/YouTube-periodic-table-Explosive-video-guides.html |title=YouTube periodic table: Explosive video guides |author=Matthew Moore |date=15 Jul 2008 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many school teachers now incorporate these videos into their classes,&lt;ref name="professor1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite video|date = 20 December 2009|title = Web Wizard|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6002511n|publisher = [[CBS News]]|accessdate = 17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the professor has even recorded video responses to some of the students' questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video|people = Brady Haran (producer)|title = Questions for The Professor – ''Periodic Table of Videos''|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0F_ztEv_v1Y|publisher = The Periodic Table of Videos|location = Nottingham, UK|date = 3 August 2009|accessdate = 7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most popular videos are those of [[sodium]],&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt; [[potassium]], and [[uranium]].

''The Periodic Table of Videos'' team has had two live performances to date, the first in May 2009 at the [[Broadway Media Centre]] in [[Nottingham]], and most recently in July 2010 at the [[EuroScience]] Open Forum (ESOF) in [[Turin]], Italy.&lt;ref name="professor1"/&gt;

==Financing==
A grant from the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] of £25,249 was awarded on 19 January, 2010 to extend the video library to include topical videos on molecules of general interest.&lt;ref name="EPSRCvideo"&gt;{{cite video|date = June 4, 2010|title = It's elementary, my dear Poliakoff!|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EmN6XpbIBI|publisher = [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]]|accessdate = 17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grant"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/H027424/1 |title=''The Periodic Table of Videos'': MolVids Grant |publisher=[[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] |accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these new videos were on [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]].&lt;ref name="EPSRCvideo"/&gt;

==Videos==
''The Periodic Table of Videos'' has filmed at least one video for each of the 118 elements (from [[hydrogen]] to [[oganesson]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.periodicvideos.com/ Read below the periodic table] "Tables charting the chemical elements have been around since the 19th century – but this modern version has a short video about each one.
We've done all 118 – but our job's not finished. Now we're updating all the videos with new stories, better samples and bigger experiments.

Plus we're making films about other areas of chemistry, latest news and occasional adventures away from the lab.

We've also started a new series – The Molecular Videos – featuring our favourite molecules and compounds.

All these videos are created by video journalist Brady Haran, featuring real working chemists from the University of Nottingham."&lt;/ref&gt; They have also filmed several videos that discuss molecules such as D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ([[heavy water]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/mv_heavywater.htm Heavy water video]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/mv_sulfuric_acid.htm Sulfuric acid video]&lt;/ref&gt; Also filmed are "Chem definitions" that provide an explanation to words that are used in chemistry. Lastly, the team has filmed "Roadtrips" where they travel to different places in the world that have an importance in chemistry (such as the mine outside [[Ytterby]], [[Sweden]], which had four elements&amp;nbsp;– [[yttrium]], [[terbium]], [[erbium]], and [[ytterbium]]&amp;nbsp;– named after it.)

[[File:Personality dimensions.JPG|thumb|A picture of the depictions of personality dimensions.]]

'''Personality psychology''' is a branch of [[psychology]] that studies [[personality]] and its variation among [[individual]]s. It is a scientific study which aims to show how people are individually different due to psychological forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality: Classic theories and modern research|last=Friedman|first=Howard|last2=Schustack|first2=Miriam|publisher=USA: Pearson|year=2016|isbn=978-0-205-99793-0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its areas of focus include:

* construction of a coherent picture of the [[person|individual]] and their major psychological processes
* investigation of individual psychological differences
* investigation of [[human nature]] and psychological similarities between individuals

"Personality" is a dynamic{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and organized set of characteristics possessed by a person that uniquely{{clarify|date=October 2016}} influences their environment, [[cognition]]s, [[emotion]]s, [[motivation]]s, and [[Behavioural sciences|behaviors]] in various situations. The word ''personality'' originates from the [[Latin]] ''persona'', which means "[[mask]]".

Personality also refers to the pattern of [[thought]]s, [[feeling]]s, [[Adjustment (psychology)|social adjustments]], and [[behavior]]s consistently exhibited over time that strongly influences one's expectations, [[Self-concept|self-perceptions]], [[Value (ethics)|value]]s, and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s. Personality also predicts human reactions to other people, problems, and [[Stress (biology)|stress]].&lt;ref name = Winnie&gt;Winnie, J.F. &amp; Gittinger, J.W. (1973) An introduction to the personality assessment system. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, Monograph Supplement, 38,1=68''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, C.J. &amp; Saunders, D.R, (1994) Personality and Ability: The Personality Assessment System. University Press of America, Lanham, Maryland&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] (1937) described two major ways to study personality: the nomothetic and the [[Idiographic image|idiographic]]. ''Nomothetic psychology'' seeks general laws that can be applied to many different people, such as the principle of [[self-actualization]] or the trait of [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]]. ''Idiographic psychology'' is an attempt to understand the unique aspects of a particular individual.

The study of [[personality]] has a broad and varied history in psychology with an abundance of theoretical trad. The major theories include dispositional (trait) perspective, psychodynamic, humanistic, biological, behaviorist, evolutionary, and social learning perspective. However, many researchers and psychologists do not explicitly identify themselves with a certain perspective and instead take an eclectic approach. Research in this area is empirically driven, such as dimensional models, based on [[multivariate statistics]], such as [[factor analysis]], or emphasizes theory development, such as that of the [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] theory. There is also a substantial emphasis on the applied field of personality testing. In psychological education and training, the study of the nature of personality and its psychological development is usually reviewed as a prerequisite to courses in [[abnormal psychology]] or [[clinical psychology]].

==Philosophical assumptions==
Many of the ideas developed by historical and modern [[personality]] theorists stem from the basic philosophical assumptions they hold. The study of personality is not a purely empirical discipline, as it brings in elements of [[art]], [[science]], and [[philosophy]] to draw general conclusions. The following five categories are some of the most fundamental philosophical assumptions on which theorists disagree:&lt;ref name=Engler&gt;{{cite book|last=Engler|first=Barbara|title=Personality theories : an introduction|year=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9780547148342|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Freedom versus determinism''' – This is the question whether humans have control over their own behavior and understand the motives behind it or if their behavior is causally determined by forces beyond their control. Behavior is categorized as being either unconscious, environmental or biological by various theories.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt;
* '''Heredity versus environment''' – Personality is thought to be determined largely either by [[genetics]] and [[biology]], or by environment and experiences. Contemporary research suggests that most personality traits are based on the joint influence of genetics and environment. One of the forerunners in this arena is [[C. Robert Cloninger]], who pioneered the Temperament and Character model.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt;
* '''Uniqueness versus universality''' – This question discusses the extent of each human's individuality ([[uniqueness]]) or similarity in nature ([[Universality (philosophy)|universality]]). [[Gordon Allport]], [[Abraham Maslow]], and [[Carl Rogers]] were all advocates of the uniqueness of individuals. Behaviorists and cognitive theorists, in contrast, emphasize the importance of universal principles, such as reinforcement and self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt;
* '''Active versus reactive''' – This question explores whether humans primarily act through individual initiative (active) or through outside [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]]. Traditional behavioral theorists typically believed that humans are passively shaped by their environments, whereas humanistic and cognitive theorists believe that humans are more active in their role.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt; Most modern theorists agree that both are important, with aggregate behavior being primarily determined by traits and situational factors being the primary predictor of behavior in the short term.&lt;ref name = person_situation&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fleeson | first1 = W. | year = 2004 | title = Moving personality beyond the person-situation debate: The challenge and the opportunity of within-person variability | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 83–87 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00280.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zayas|first=V|author2=Shoda Y|title=Three decades after the personality paradox: Understanding situations|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|year=2009|volume=43|pages=280–281|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2009.03.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tapu|first=C.S.|title=Hypostatic personality: psychopathology of doing and being made|year=2001|publisher=Premier|isbn=9738030595|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Optimistic versus pessimistic''' – Personality theories differ with regard to whether humans are integral in the changing of their own personalities. Theories that place a great deal of emphasis on learning are often more optimistic than those that do not.&lt;ref name=Engler /&gt;

== Personality theories ==

=== Type theories ===
[[Personality type]] refers to the psychological classification of different types of people. Personality types are distinguished from [[trait theory|personality traits]], which come in different degrees. There are many types of theories regarding personality, but each theory contains several and sometimes many sub theories. A "theory of personality" constructed by any given psychologist will contain multiple relating theories or sub theories often expanding as more psychologists explore the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cartwright |first1=Desmond |title=Theories and Models of Personality |date=1979 |publisher=Wm. C. Brown Company Publishers |location=Debuque, Iowa |isbn=0-697-06624-X |page=178 |edition=I |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to type theories, there are two types of people, introverts and extroverts. According to trait theories, introversion and extroversion are part of a continuous dimension with many people in the middle. The idea of psychological types originated in the theoretical work of [[Carl Jung]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp |first=Daryl |title= Personality types: Jung's model of typology |year=1987 |publisher=Inner City Books |location= Toronto, Canada |isbn= 0919123309|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically in his 1921 book ''Psychologische Typen'' (''[[Psychological Types]]'')  and [[William Moulton Marston|William Marston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradberry|first=T|title=Self-Awareness|year=2009|publisher=Penguin|isbn=1101148675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on the writings and observations of Jung during World War II, [[Isabel Briggs Myers]] and her mother, Katharine C. Briggs, delineated personality types by constructing the [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator]].&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite book |author=Myers, Isabel Briggs with Peter B. Myers|title=Gifts Differing: Understanding Personality Type |publisher=Davies-Black Publishing |location=Mountain View, California |origyear=1980|year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-89106-074-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This model was later used by [[David Keirsey]] with a different understanding from Jung, Briggs and Myers.&lt;ref name=K123123123123123&gt;{{cite book |date= May 1, 1998 |title=Please Understand Me II: Temperament, Character, Intelligence |publisher=Prometheus Nemesis Book Co|edition=1st |isbn=1-885705-02-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the former Soviet Union, [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] [[Aušra Augustinavičiūtė]] independently derived a model of personality type from Jung's called [[socionics]].

Theories could also be considered an "approach" to personality or psychology and is generally referred to as a model.  The model is an older and more theoretical approach to personality, accepting extroversion and introversion as basic psychological orientations in connection with two pairs of psychological functions:

* ''Perceiving functions:'' sensing and intuition (trust in concrete, sensory-oriented facts vs. trust in abstract concepts and imagined possibilities)
* ''Judging functions:'' thinking and feeling (basing decisions primarily on logic vs. deciding based on emotion).

Briggs and Myers also added another personality dimension to their type indicator to measure whether a person prefers to use a judging or perceiving function when interacting with the external world.  Therefore, they included questions designed to indicate whether someone wishes to come to conclusions (judgment) or to keep options open (perception).&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;

This personality typology has some aspects of a trait theory: it explains people's behavior in terms of opposite fixed characteristics.  In these more traditional models, the sensing/intuition preference is considered the most basic, dividing people into "N" (intuitive) or "S" (sensing) personality types. An "N" is further assumed to be guided either by thinking or feeling and divided into the "NT" (scientist, engineer) or "NF" (author, humanitarian) temperament. An "S", in contrast, is assumed to be guided more by the judgment/perception axis and thus divided into the "SJ" (guardian, traditionalist) or "SP" (performer, artisan) temperament.&lt;!-- remark out undefined &lt;ref name=Keirsey/&gt; --&gt; These four are considered basic, with the other two factors in each case (including always extraversion/introversion) less important. Critics of this traditional view have observed that the types can be quite strongly stereotyped by professions (although neither Myers nor Keirsey engaged in such stereotyping in their type descriptions),&lt;ref name=Myers/&gt;&lt;!-- remark out undefined ref &lt;ref name=Keirsey/&gt; --&gt; and thus may arise more from the need to categorize people for purposes of guiding their career choice.&lt;ref name=Pittenger&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pittenger | first = David J. | title = Measuring the MBTI. . .And Coming Up Short | journal = Journal of Career Planning and Employment | volume = 54 | issue = 1 | pages = 48–52 |date=November 1993 | url = http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/HRMWebsite/hrm/articles/develop/mbti.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This among other objections led to the emergence of the five-factor view, which is less concerned with behavior under work conditions and more concerned with behavior in personal and emotional circumstances.  (It should be noted, however, that the MBTI is not designed to measure the "work self", but rather what Myers and McCaulley called the "shoes-off self."&lt;ref name=manual_2&gt;{{cite book|last=Myers|first=Isabel Briggs|author2=Mary H.

[[Type A and Type B personality theory]]:  During the 1950s, [[Meyer Friedman]] and his co-workers defined what they called Type A and Type B behavior patterns. They theorized that intense, hard-driving Type A personalities had a higher risk of coronary disease because they are "stress junkies." Type B people, on the other hand, tended to be relaxed, less competitive, and lower in risk. There was also a Type AB mixed profile.

[[John L. Holland]]'s ''RIASEC'' vocational model, commonly referred to as the ''[[Holland Codes]]'', stipulates that six personality types lead people to choose their career paths. In this circumplex model, the six types are represented as a hexagon, with adjacent types more closely related than those more distant. The model is widely used in vocational counseling.

[[Eduard Spranger]]'s personality-model, consisting of six (or, by some revisions, 6 +1) basic types of ''value attitudes'', described in his book ''Types of Men'' (''Lebensformen''; Halle (Saale): Niemeyer, 1914; English translation by P. J. W. Pigors - New York: G. E. Stechert Company, 1928).

The [[Enneagram of Personality]], a model of human personality which is principally used as a typology of nine interconnected personality types. It has been criticized as being subject to interpretation, making it difficult to test or validate scientifically.

Perhaps the most ancient attempt at personality psychology is the [[Buddhist personality types|personality typology]] outlined by the Indian [[Buddhist]] [[Abhidharma]] schools. This typology mostly focuses on negative personal traits (greed, hatred, and delusion) and the corresponding positive [[meditation]] practices used to counter those traits.

=== Psychoanalytic theories ===

[[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytic]] theories explain human behavior in terms of the interaction of various components of personality. [[Sigmund Freud]] was the founder of this school of thought. Freud drew on the physics of his day (thermodynamics) to coin the term [[psychodynamics]]. Based on the idea of converting heat into mechanical energy, he proposed psychic energy could be converted into behavior. Freud's theory places central importance on dynamic, unconscious psychological conflicts.&lt;ref name=Kahn&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahn|first=Michael|title=Basic Freud : psychoanalytic thought for the twenty first century|year=2002|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=9780465037162|edition=1. paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud divides human personality into three significant components: the [[id, ego and super-ego]].  The '''id''' acts according to the ''pleasure principle'', demanding immediate gratification of its needs regardless of external environment; the '''ego''' then must emerge in order to realistically meet the wishes and demands of the id in accordance with the outside world, adhering to the ''reality principle''. Finally, the '''superego''' (conscience) inculcates moral judgment and societal rules upon the ego, thus forcing the demands of the id to be met not only realistically but morally. The superego is the last function of the personality to develop, and is the embodiment of parental/social ideals established during childhood. According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of these three components.&lt;ref name="Carver"&gt;Carver, C., &amp; Scheier, M. (2004). ''Perspectives on Personality'' (5th ed.). Boston: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

The channeling and release of sexual (libidal) and aggressive energies, which ensues from the "Eros" (sex; instinctual self-preservation) and "Thanatos" (death; instinctual self-annihilation) drives respectively, are major components of his theory.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;  It is important to note that Freud's broad understanding of sexuality included all kinds of pleasurable feelings experienced by the human body.

Freud proposed five psychosexual stages of personality development. He believed adult personality is dependent upon early childhood experiences and largely determined by age five.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;  Fixations that develop during the infantile stage contribute to adult personality and behavior.

One of Sigmund Freud's earlier associates, [[Alfred Adler]], did agree with Freud that early childhood experiences are important to development and believed birth order may influence personality development. Adler believed that the oldest child was the individual who would set high achievement goals in order to gain attention lost when the younger siblings were born. He believed the middle children were competitive and ambitious.  He reasoned that this behavior was motivated by the idea of surpassing the firstborn's achievements.   He added, however, that the middle children were often not as concerned about the glory attributed with their behavior. He also believed the youngest would be more dependent and sociable. Adler finished by surmising that an only child loves being the center of attention and matures quickly but in the end fails to become independent.

[[Heinz Kohut]] thought similarly to Freud's idea of transference. He used [[narcissism]] as a model of how people develop their sense of self. Narcissism is the exaggerated sense of one self in which one is believed to exist in order to protect one's low self-esteem and sense of worthlessness. Kohut had a significant impact on the field by extending Freud's theory of narcissism and introducing what he called the 'self-object transferences' of mirroring and idealization. In other words, children need to idealize and emotionally "sink into" and identify with the idealized competence of admired figures such as parents or older siblings. They also need to have their self-worth mirrored by these people. These experiences allow them to thereby learn the self-soothing and other skills that are necessary for the development of a healthy sense of self.

Another important figure in the world of personality theory is [[Karen Horney]]. She is credited with the development of the "[[True self and false self|real self]]" and the "ideal self". She believes all people have these two views of their own self. The "real self" is how humans act with regard to personality, values, and morals; but the "ideal self" is a construct individuals implement in order to conform to social and personal norms.

=== Behaviorist theories ===

[[Behaviorism|Behaviorists]] explain personality in terms of the effects external stimuli have on behavior.  The approaches used to analyze the behavioral aspect of personality are known as behavioral theories or learning-conditioning theories. These approaches were a radical shift away from Freudian philosophy. One of the major tenets of this concentration of personality psychology is a strong emphasis on scientific thinking and experimentation.  This school of thought was developed by [[B. F. Skinner]] who put forth a model which emphasized the mutual interaction of the person or "the organism" with its environment.  Skinner believed children do bad things because the behavior obtains attention that serves as a reinforcer. For example: a child cries because the child's crying in the past has led to attention.  These are the ''response'', and ''consequences''.  The response is the child crying, and the attention that child gets is the reinforcing consequence. According to this theory, people's behavior is formed by processes such as [[operant conditioning]].  Skinner put forward a "three term contingency model" which helped promote analysis of behavior based on the "Stimulus - Response - Consequence Model" in which the critical question is: "Under which circumstances or antecedent 'stimuli' does the organism engage in a particular behavior or 'response', which in turn produces a particular 'consequence'?"&lt;ref name=Cheney&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheney|first=W. David Pierce, Carl D.|title=Behavior analysis and learning|year=2008|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780805862607|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Herrnstein]] extended this theory by accounting for attitudes and traits.  An attitude develops as the response strength (the tendency to respond) in the presences of a group of stimuli become stable.  Rather than describing conditionable traits in non-behavioral language, response strength in a given situation accounts for the environmental portion.  Herrstein also saw traits as having a large genetic or biological component, as do most modern behaviorists.&lt;ref name=Cheney /&gt;

[[Ivan Pavlov]] is another notable influence. He is well known for his [[classical conditioning]] experiments involving dogs, which led him to discover the foundation of behaviorism.&lt;ref name=Cheney /&gt;

=== Social cognitive theories ===

In cognitive theory, behavior is explained as guided by cognitions (e.g. expectations) about the world, especially those about other people. Cognitive theories are theories of personality that emphasize cognitive processes, such as thinking and judging.

[[Albert Bandura]], a [[social learning theory|social learning theorist]] suggested the forces of [[memory]] and [[emotion]]s worked in conjunction with environmental influences. Bandura was known mostly for his "[[Bobo doll experiment]]". During these experiments, Bandura video taped a college student kicking and verbally abusing a bobo doll. He then showed this video to a class of kindergarten children who were getting ready to go out to play. When they entered the play room, they saw bobo dolls, and some hammers. The people observing these children at play saw a group of children beating the doll. He called this study and his findings observational learning, or modeling.

Early examples of approaches to cognitive style are listed by Baron (1982).&lt;ref&gt;Baron, J. (1982). "Intelligence and Personality." In R. Sternberg (Ed.). ''Handbook of Intelligence''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These include Witkin's (1965) work on field dependency, Gardner's (1953) discovering people had consistent preference for the number of categories they used to categorise heterogeneous objects, and Block and Petersen's (1955) work on confidence in line discrimination judgments. Baron relates early development of cognitive approaches of personality to [[ego psychology]]. More central to this field have been:

* [[Explanatory style|Attributional style theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abramson |first1=Lyn Y. |last2=Seligman |first2=Martin E. P. |last3=Teasdale |first3=John D. |date=1978 |title=Learned helplessness in humans: Critique and reformulation |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=49–74 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.87.1.49 |pmid=649856 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with different ways in which people explain events in their lives. This approach builds upon locus of control, but extends it by stating we also need to consider whether people attribute to stable causes or variable causes, and to global causes or specific causes.

Various scales have been developed to assess both attributional style and locus of control. Locus of control scales include those used by Rotter and later by Duttweiler, the Nowicki and Strickland (1973) Locus of Control Scale for Children and various locus of control scales specifically in the health domain, most famously that of Kenneth Wallston and his colleagues, The Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale.&lt;ref&gt;Wallston et al., 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Attributional style has been assessed by the Attributional Style Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;Peterson et al., 1982&lt;/ref&gt; the Expanded Attributional Style Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;Peterson &amp; Villanova, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; the Attributions Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;Gong-guy &amp; Hammen,  1990&lt;/ref&gt; the Real Events Attributional Style Questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;Norman &amp; Antaki, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and the Attributional Style Assessment Test.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

* Achievement style theory focuses upon identification of an individual's Locus of Control tendency, such as by Rotter's evaluations, and was found by Cassandra Bolyard Whyte to provide valuable information for improving academic performance of students.&lt;ref name="Whyte1978"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whyte |first=Cassandra Bolyard |year=1978 |title=Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen |journal=Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=198–200 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with internal control tendencies are likely to persist to better academic performance levels, presenting an achievement personality, according to [[Cassandra B. Whyte]].&lt;ref name="Whyte1978" /&gt;

Recognition that the tendency to believe that hard work and persistence often results in attainment of life and academic goals has influenced formal educational and counseling efforts with students of various ages and in various settings since the 1970s research about achievement.&lt;ref name="LauridsenKurt"&gt;Lauridsen Kurt (ed) and Whyte, Cassandra B. (1985) An Integrated Counseling and Learning Assistance Center-Chapter for New Directions Sourcebook. Jossey-Bass, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; Counseling aimed toward encouraging individuals to design ambitious goals and work toward them, with recognition that there are external factors that may impact, often results in the incorporation of a more positive achievement style by students and employees, whatever the setting, to include higher education, workplace, or justice programming.&lt;ref name="LauridsenKurt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whyte | first1 = Cassandra | last2 = Whyte | first2 = William R. | year = 1982 | title = Accelerated Programs Behind Prison Walls | url = | journal = College Student Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 70–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Mischel]] (1999) has also defended a cognitive approach to personality. His work refers to "Cognitive Affective Units", and considers factors such as encoding of stimuli, affect, goal-setting, and self-regulatory beliefs. The term "Cognitive Affective Units" shows how his approach considers affect as well as cognition.

[[Cognitive-Experiential Self-Theory]] (CEST) is another cognitive personality theory.  Developed by Seymour Epstein, CEST argues that humans operate by way of two independent information processing systems: experiential system and rational system.  The experiential system is fast and emotion-driven.  The rational system is slow and logic-driven.  These two systems interact to determine our goals, thoughts, and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Seymour; In: Handbook of psychology: Personality and social psychology, Vol. 5. Millon, Theodore (Ed.); Lerner, Melvin J. (Ed.); Hoboken, NJ, US: John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, 2003. pp. 159-184. [Chapter]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Personal construct theory|Personal construct psychology]] (PCP) is a theory of personality developed by the American psychologist [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] in the 1950s. Kelly's fundamental view of personality was that people are like naive scientists who see the world through a particular lens, based on their uniquely organized systems of construction, which they use to anticipate events. But because people are naive scientists, they sometimes employ systems for construing the world that are distorted by idiosyncratic experiences not applicable to their current social situation. A system of construction that chronically fails to characterize and/or predict events, and is not appropriately revised to comprehend and predict one's changing social world, is considered to underlie psychopathology (or mental illness.){{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
From the theory, Kelly derived a [[psychotherapy]] approach and also a technique called ''The Repertory Grid Interview'' that helped his patients to uncover their own "constructs"  with minimal intervention or interpretation by the therapist. The [[repertory grid]] was later adapted for various uses within organizations, including decision-making and interpretation of other people's world-views.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=George A.|title=Theory of Personality : the psychology of personal constructs.|year=1980|publisher=Norton|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0393001520|edition=1. publ. in ... pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humanistic theories ===
[[Humanistic psychology]] emphasizes that people have [[free will]] and that this plays an active role in determining how they behave. Accordingly, humanistic psychology focuses on subjective experiences of persons as opposed to forced, definitive factors that determine behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Stefaroi, P. (2015). Humanistic Personology: A Humanistic-Ontological Theory of the Person &amp; Personality. Applications in Therapy, Social Work, Education, Management and Art (Theatre).  Charleston SC, USA: CreateSpace.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Carl Rogers]] were proponents of this view, which is based on the "phenomenal field" theory of Combs and Snygg (1949).&lt;ref&gt;Combs, Arthur W., and Snygg, Donald. '' : A New Frame of Reference for Psychology''. New York, Harper and Brothers. [http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/snygg&amp;combs.html Article on Snygg and Combs' Phenomenological Field Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers and Maslow were among a group of psychologists that worked together for a decade to produce the ''Journal of Humanistic Psychology''. This journal was primarily focused on viewing individuals as a whole, rather than focusing solely on separate traits and processes within the individual.

[[Robert W. White (psychologist)|Robert W. White]] wrote the book ''The Abnormal Personality'' that became a standard text on [[abnormal psychology]]. He also investigated the human need to strive for positive goals like competence and influence, to counterbalance the emphasis of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] on the pathological elements of personality development.&lt;ref name=Watt&gt;{{cite book|last=Watt|first=Robert W. White ; Norman F.|title=The abnormal personality|year=1981|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-04599-1|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maslow spent much of his time studying what he called "self-actualizing persons", those who are "fulfilling themselves and doing the best they are capable of doing". Maslow believes all who are interested in growth move towards self-actualizing (growth, happiness, satisfaction) views. Many of these people demonstrate a trend in dimensions of their personalities. Characteristics of self-actualizers according to Maslow include the four key dimensions:&lt;ref name=Maslow&gt;{{cite book|last=Maslow|first=Abraham H.|title=Toward a Psychology of Being|year=1999|publisher=Wiley|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-471-29309-1|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Awareness''' – maintaining constant enjoyment and awe of life. These individuals often experienced a "peak experience". He defined a peak experience as an "intensification of any experience to the degree there is a loss or transcendence of self". A peak experience is one in which an individual perceives an expansion of themselves, and detects a unity and meaningfulness in life. Intense concentration on an activity one is involved in, such as running a marathon, may invoke a peak experience.
# '''Reality and problem centered''' – having a tendency to be concerned with "problems" in surroundings.
# '''Acceptance/Spontaneity''' – accepting surroundings and what cannot be changed.
# '''Unhostile sense of humor/democratic''' – do not take kindly to  joking about others, which can be viewed as offensive. They have friends of all backgrounds and religions and hold very close friendships.

Maslow and Rogers emphasized a view of the person as an active, creative, experiencing human being who lives in the present and subjectively responds to current perceptions, relationships, and encounters. They disagree with the dark, pessimistic outlook of those in the Freudian psychoanalysis ranks, but rather view humanistic theories as positive and optimistic proposals which stress the tendency of the human personality toward growth and self-actualization. This progressing self will remain the center of its constantly changing world; a world that will help mold the self but not necessarily confine it. Rather, the self has opportunity for maturation based on its encounters with this world. This understanding attempts to reduce the acceptance of hopeless redundancy. Humanistic therapy typically relies on the client for information of the past and its effect on the present, therefore the client dictates the type of guidance the therapist may initiate. This allows for an individualized approach to therapy. Rogers found patients differ in how they respond to other people. Rogers tried to model a particular approach to therapy- he stressed the reflective or empathetic response. This response type takes the client's viewpoint and reflects back their feeling and the context for it. An example of a reflective response would be, "It seems you are feeling anxious about your upcoming marriage". This response type seeks to clarify the therapist's understanding while also encouraging the client to think more deeply and seek to fully understand the feelings they have expressed.

=== Biopsychological theories ===

Biology plays a very important role in the development of personality. The study of the biological level in personality psychology focuses primarily on identifying the role of genetic determinants and how they mold individual personalities.&lt;ref&gt;Plomin, R., DeFries, J.C., McClearn, G.E., &amp; Rutter, M. (1997). ''Behavioral genetics'' (3rd Ed.). New York: Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest thinking about possible biological bases of personality grew out of the case of [[Phineas Gage]]. In an 1848 accident, a large iron rod was driven through Gage's head, and his personality apparently changed as a result, although descriptions&lt;ref name="return_of_phineas"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Damasio H. |author2=Grabowski T |author3=.

In general, patients with brain damage have been difficult to find and study. In the 1990s, researchers began to use [[electroencephalography]] (EEG),  [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), and more recently [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), which is now the most widely used imaging technique to help localize personality traits in the brain.

====Genetic basis of personality====
Ever since the [[Human Genome Project]] allowed for a much more in depth understanding of genetics, there has been an ongoing controversy involving heritability, personality traits, and environmental vs. genetic influence on personality. The human genome is known to play a role in the development of personality.&lt;br /&gt;
Previously, genetic personality studies focused on specific genes correlating to specific personality traits. Today's view of the gene-personality relationship focuses primarily on the activation and expression of genes related to personality and forms part of what is referred to as [[behavioural genetics]]. Genes provide numerous options for varying cells to be expressed; however, the environment determines which of these are activated. Many studies have noted this relationship in varying ways in which our bodies can develop, but the interaction between genes and the shaping of our minds and personality is also relevant to this biological relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Gazzaniga, M.S., &amp; Heatherton, T.F. (2006). ''Psychological science: Mind, brain, and behavior'' (2nd ed.). New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
DNA-environment interactions are important in the development of personality because this relationship determines what part of the DNA code is actually made into proteins that will become part of an individual. It has been noted that while different choices are made available by the genome, in the end, the environment is the ultimate determinant of what becomes activated. Small changes in DNA in individuals are what lead to the uniqueness of every person as well as differences in looks, abilities, brain functioning, and all the factors that culminate to develop a cohesive personality.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, G. (2004). ''The birth of the mind.'' New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattell and Eysenck have proposed that genetics have a strong influence on personality. A large part of the evidence collected linking genetics and the environment to personality have come from [[Twin study|twin studies]]. This "twin method" compares levels of similarity in personality using genetically identical [[twin]]s. One of the first of these twin studies measured 800 pairs of twins, studied numerous personality traits, and determined that identical twins are most similar in their general abilities. Personality similarities were found to be less related for self-concepts, goals, and interests.&lt;ref name="Loehlin"&gt;Loehlin, J.C., &amp; Nichols, R.C. (1976). ''Hereditary, environment, and personality: A study of 850 sets of twins.'' Austin: University of Texas Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Twin studies have also been important in the creation of the [[Big Five personality traits|five factor personality model]]: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Neuroticism and extraversion are the two most widely studied traits. A person that may fall into the extravert category can display characteristics such as impulsiveness, sociability, and activeness. A person falling into the neuroticism category may be more likely to be moody, anxious, or irritable. Identical twins, however, have higher correlations in personality traits than fraternal twins. One study measuring genetic influence on twins in five different countries found that the correlations for identical twins were .50, while for fraternal they were about .20.&lt;ref name="Loehlin" /&gt; It is suggested that heredity and environment interact to determine one's personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldberg | first1 = L.R. | year = 1990 | title = An alternative "description of personality": The Big-Five factor structure | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 1216–1229 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.6.1216 | pmid=2283588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jeronimus, B.F.|author2= Riese, H.|author3= Sanderman, R.|author4= Ormel, J.|year=2014|title= Mutual Reinforcement Between Neuroticism and Life Experiences: A Five-Wave, 16-Year Study to Test Reciprocal Causation|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=107|issue=4|pages=751–64|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0037009|doi=10.1037/a0037009|pmid=25111305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary theory===

[[Charles Darwin]] is the founder of the [[Darwinism|theory of the evolution of the species]]. The evolutionary approach to personality psychology is based on this theory.&lt;ref name="Buss"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = D.M. | year = 1991 | title = Evolutionary personality psychology | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 459–491 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.42.1.459}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory examines how individual personality differences are based on [[natural selection]]. Through natural selection organisms change over time through adaptation and selection. Traits are developed and certain genes come into expression based on an organism's environment and how these traits aid in an organism's survival and reproduction.

[[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphisms]], such as gender and blood type, are forms of diversity which evolve to benefit a species as a whole.&lt;ref name="Ford unk."&gt;[[E.B. Ford|Ford E.B.]] 1965. ''Genetic polymorphism''. Faber &amp; Faber, London.&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory of evolution has wide-ranging implications on personality psychology. Personality viewed through the lens of evolutionary psychology places a great deal of emphasis on specific traits that are most likely to aid in survival and reproduction, such as conscientiousness, sociability, emotional stability, and dominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenrick | first1 = D.T. | last2 = Sadalla | first2 = E.K. | last3 = Groth | first3 = G. | last4 = Trost | first4 = M.R. | year = 1990 | title = Evolution, traits, and the stages of human courtship: Qualifying the parental investment model | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 97–116 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1990.tb00909.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social aspects of personality can be seen through an evolutionary perspective. Specific character traits develop and are selected for because they play an important and complex role in the social hierarchy of organisms. Such characteristics of this social hierarchy include the sharing of important resources, family and mating interactions, and the harm or help organisms can bestow upon one another.&lt;ref name="Buss" /&gt;


=== Drive theories===

In the 1930s, [[John Dollard]] and [[Neal Elgar Miller]] met at [[Yale University]], and began an attempt to integrate drives (see [[Drive theory]]), into a theory of personality, basing themselves on the work of [[Clark Hull]]. They began with the premise that personality could be equated with the habitual responses exhibited by an individual – their habits. From there, they determined that these habitual responses were built on secondary, or acquired drives. 

Secondary drives are internal needs directing the behaviour of an individual that results from learning.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dollard|first1=John|last2=Miller|first2=Neil|title=Social Learning and Imitation|date=1941|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, London|edition=Tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acquired drives are learned, by and large in the manner described by [[classical conditioning]]. When we are in a certain environment and experience a strong response to a stimulus, we internalize cues from the said environment.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; When we find ourselves in an environment with similar cues, we begin to act in anticipation of a similar stimulus.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Thus, we are likely to experience anxiety in an environment with cues similar to one where we have experienced pain or fear – such as the dentist's office.  

Secondary drives are built on primary drives, which are biologically driven, and motivate us to act with no prior learning process – such as hunger, thirst or the need for sexual activity. However, secondary drives are thought to represent more specific elaborations of primary drives, behind which the functions of the original primary drive continue to exist.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Thus, the primary drives of fear and pain exist behind the acquired drive of anxiety. Secondary drives can be based on multiple primary drives and even in other secondary drives. This is said to give them strength and persistence.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Examples include the need for money, which was conceptualized as arising from multiple primary drives such as the drive for food and warmth, as well as from secondary drives such as imitativeness (the drive to do as others do) and anxiety.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt;

Secondary drives vary based on the social conditions under which they were learned – such as culture. Dollard and Miller used the example of food, stating that the primary drive of hunger manifested itself behind the learned secondary drive of an appetite for a specific type of food, which was dependent on the culture of the individual.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt;

Secondary drives are also explicitly social, representing a manner in which we convey our primary drives to others.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Howard.S.|last2=Schustack|first2=Miriam.W.|title=Personality: Classic Theories and Modern Research|date=2015|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0205997930|edition=Sixth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many primary drives are actively repressed by society (such as the sexual drive).&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Dollard and Miller believed that the acquisition of secondary drives was essential to childhood development.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt; As children develop, they learn not to act on their primary drives, such as hunger but acquire secondary drives through reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; Friedman and Schustack describe an example of such developmental changes, stating that if an infant engaging in an active orientation towards others brings about the fulfillment of primary drives, such as being fed or having their diaper changed, they will develop a secondary drive to pursue similar interactions with others – perhaps leading to an individual being more gregarious.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt; Dollard and Miller's belief in the importance of acquired drives led them to reconceive [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of psychosexual development.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt; They found themselves to be in agreement with the timing Freud used but believed that these periods corresponded to the successful learning of certain secondary drives.&lt;ref name="Friedman and Schustack, 2015" /&gt;

Dollard and Miller gave many examples of how secondary drives impact our habitual responses – and by extension our personalities, including anger, social conformity, imitativeness or anxiety, to name a few. In the case of anxiety, Dollard and Miller note that people who generalize the situation in which they experience the anxiety drive will experience anxiety far more than they should.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; These people are often anxious all the time, and anxiety becomes part of their personality.&lt;ref name="Dollard, Smith, 1941" /&gt; This example shows how drive theory can have ties with other theories of personality – many of them look at the trait of neuroticism or emotional stability in people, which is strongly linked to anxiety.

==Personality tests==

There are two major types of personality tests, projective and objective.

''Projective tests'' assume personality is primarily unconscious and assess individuals by how they respond to an ambiguous stimulus, such as an ink blot. Projective tests have been in use for about 60 years and continue to be used today. Examples of such tests include the [[Rorschach test]] and the [[Thematic Apperception Test]].

The Rorschach Test involves showing an individual a series of note cards with ambiguous ink blots on them. The individual being tested is asked to provide interpretations of the blots on the cards by stating everything that the ink blot may resemble based on their personal interpretation. The therapist then analyzes their responses. Rules for scoring the test have been covered in manuals that cover a wide variety of characteristics such as content, originality of response, location of "perceived images" and several other factors. Using these specific scoring methods, the therapist will then attempt to relate test responses to attributes of the individual's personality and their unique characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Exner, J.E. (1993). ''The Rorschach: A comprehensive system, Vol. 1: Basic foundations'' (3rd ed.). New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that unconscious needs will come out in the person's response, e.g. an aggressive person may see images of destruction.&lt;br /&gt;
The Thematic Apperception Test (also known as the TAT) involves presenting individuals with vague pictures/scenes and asking them to tell a story based on what they see. Common examples of these "scenes" include images that may suggest family relationships or specific situations, such as a father and son or a man and a woman in a bedroom.&lt;ref&gt;Bellak, L., &amp; Abrams, D.M. (1997). ''The Thematic Apperception Test, the Children's Apperception Test, and the Senior Apperception Technique in clinical use'' (6th ed.). Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; Responses are analyzed for common themes. Responses unique to an individual are theoretically meant to indicate underlying thoughts, processes, and potentially conflicts present within the individual. Responses are believed to be directly linked to unconscious motives. There is very little empirical evidence available to support these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watkins | first1 = C.E. | last2 = Campbell | first2 = V.L. | last3 = Nieberding | first3 = R. | last4 = Hallmark | first4 = R. | year = 1995 | title = Contemporary practice of psychological assessment by clinical psychologists | url = | journal = [[Professional Psychology, Research and Practice]] | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 54–60 | doi=10.1037/0735-7028.26.1.54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Objective tests'' assume personality is consciously accessible and that it can be measured by self-report questionnaires. Research on psychological assessment has generally found objective tests to be more valid and reliable than projective tests. Critics have pointed to the [[Forer effect]] to suggest some of these appear to be more accurate and discriminating than they really are. Issues with these tests include false reporting because there is no way to tell if an individual is answering a question honestly or accurately.

The [[Myers–Briggs Type Indicator|Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] (also known as the MBTI) is self-reporting questionnaire based on [[Carl Jung]]'s [[Type theory]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/home.htm?bhcp=1|title=The Myers &amp; Briggs Foundation  - MBTI® Basics|website=www.myersbriggs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inner experience==
Psychology has traditionally defined personality through its behavioral patterns, and more recently with neuroscientific studies of the brain.  In recent years, some psychologists have turned to the study of inner experiences for insight into personality as well as individuality. Inner experiences are the thoughts and feelings to an immediate phenomenon. Another term used to define inner experiences is [[qualia]]. Being able to understand inner experiences assists in understanding how humans behave, act, and respond. Defining personality using inner experiences has been expanding due to the fact that solely relying on behavioral principles to explain one's character may seem incomplete. Behavioral methods allow the subject to be observed by an observer, whereas with inner experiences the subject is its own observer.&lt;ref name=Price&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Donald D.|title=Inner experience and neuroscience : merging both perspectives|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262017657|author2=Barrell, James J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mihelic&gt;{{cite web|last=Mihelic|first=Janell|title=Exploring the phenomena of inner experience with descriptive experience sampling|url=http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1862&amp;context=thesesdissertations|work=UNLV Theses/Dissertations/Professional Papers/Capstones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods measuring inner experience===
'''Descriptive experience sampling (DES)''', developed by psychologist Russel Hurlburt. This is an [[idiographic]] method that is used to help examine inner experiences. This method relies on an introspective technique that allows an individual's inner experiences and characteristics to be described and measured. A beep notifies the subject to record their experience at that exact moment and 24 hours later an interview is given based on all the experiences recorded. DES has been used in subjects that have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression. It has also been crucial to studying the inner experiences of those who have been diagnosed with common psychiatric diseases.&lt;ref name="Mihelic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/health/22prof.html|title=Taking Mental Snapshots to Plumb Our Inner Selves|author=Hoffman, Jascha|date= December 21, 2009|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hurlburt|first=Russell|title=Iteratively Apprehending Pristine Experience|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|year=2009|volume=16|pages=156–188|url=http://faculty.unlv.edu/hurlburt/hurlburt-2009c.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Articulated thoughts in stimulated situations (ATSS)''': ATSS is a [[paradigm]] which was created as an alternative to the TA (think aloud) method. This method assumes that people have continuous internal dialogues that can be naturally attended to. ATSS also assesses a person’s inner thoughts as they verbalize their cognitions. In this procedure, subjects listen to a scenario via a video or audio player and are asked to imagine that they are in that specific situation. Later, they are asked to articulate their thoughts as they occur in reaction to the playing scenario. This method is useful in studying emotional experience given that the scenarios used can influence specific emotions. Most importantly, the method has contributed to the study of personality. In a study conducted by Rayburn and Davison (2002), subjects’ thoughts and empathy toward anti-gay hate crimes were evaluated. The researchers found that participants showed more aggressive intentions towards the offender in scenarios which mimicked hate crimes.&lt;ref name=Mihelic /&gt;

'''Experimental method''': This method is an experimental paradigm used to study human experiences involved in the studies of sensation and perception, learning and memory, motivation, and biological psychology. The experimental psychologist usually deals with intact organisms although studies are often conducted with organisms modified by surgery, radiation, drug treatment, or long-standing deprivations of various kinds or with organisms that naturally present organic abnormalities or emotional disorders. Economists and psychologists have developed a variety of experimental methodologies to elicit and assess individual attitudes where each emotion differs for each individual. The results are then gathered and quantified to conclude if specific experiences have any common factors. This method is used to seek clarity of the experience and remove any biases to help understand the meaning behind the experience to see if it can be generalized.&lt;ref name="Price" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4898">'''Philosophy of motion''' is a branch of philosophy concerned with exploring questions on the existence and nature of motion. The central questions of this study concern the [[epistemology]] and ontology of motion, whether motion exists as we perceive it, what is it, and, if it exists,  how does it occur. The philosophy of motion is important in the study of theories of change in natural systems and is closely connected to studies of space and time in philosophy.

The philosophy of motion was of central concern to Ancient Greek and Roman philosophers, particularly the [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers such as [[Parmenides]], [[Zeno of Elea]], [[Heraclitus]] and [[Democritus]].  As such, it was influential in the development of the philosophy of science in general.

==Early history==
===The Greek Physiology===

The concept of motion is closely related to the idea of change, and it is arguments about what made change possible that led the early Greek philosophers to pioneer naturalistic explanations for phenomena.

Heraclitus had famously declared that "all is motion".

Parmenides professed that from our human point of view there are two aspects to the study of the universe of which we must be aware, on the one hand how we see it, and on the other how it must really be. Motion is a fact from our point of view, but Parmenides argues that as far as things must really be, it is logically impossible that motion could exist as we perceive it.

Zeno of Elea, a pupil of Parmenides, formulated the Arguments against motion, more commonly referred to as the [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]], in order to support his masters theories of the One and of the consequent impossibility of motion at the fundamental level. The rigorous denial of even the possibility of motion forced a more thorough response from philosophers engaged on the same theoretical project.

====Atomism and Determinism====
In response, Democritus expounded the [[atomic theory]], in which indivisible bits of matter are in constant motion through the void. In the absence of something to perturb them they fall evenly through space.

Motion conceived in this way led naturally to questions of [[free will]] and [[determinism]]. In response to this, [[Epicurus]] appears to have included the concept of the [[clinamen]], or atomic swerve. This tiny random motion serves to bring atoms into contact and begin the cascade that leads to the organisation of matter as we see it now., it also introduced an element of uncertainty which appears to have been an important concept in Epicurus' insistence on the existence of individual choice.

===Later Development===
[[Aristotle]], in his physics, defines motion  as the actuality of a potentiality.

===Buddhist===
The philosophy of motion is treated by the [[Buddhist]] philosopher [[Nagarjuna]] in his treatise the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]] or Fundamental verses of the [[Middle Way]], in the 2nd and 3rd century CE.

Further east, in China, the [[Sanlun]] school of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism developed a sophisticated philosophy of motion under the philosopher [[Sengzhao]]. His treatise called The Immutability of Things, deals with motion explicitly.

===Aztec===
Aztec metaphysics gave priority to motion over substance in its cosmological [[ontology]]. In other words, process was seen to be fundamental and objects or substances as ephemeral. Change therefore was naturally conceived of as motion, and this motion was divided into three forms, out of which all change occurs. These were named olin (bouncing, oscillating) malinalli (spinning, twisting, spiralling) and, the most important, nepantla (weaving, intersecting, joining, balancing).&lt;ref&gt;https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/53017-aztec-philosophy-understanding-a-world-in-motion/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval==
* [[Maimonides]]
* [[Averroes]]
* [[Thomas Aquinas]]

==Modern==
Achieving a coherent understanding of motion has been, and continues to be, of importance in understanding the nature of space and time in modern science.{{According to whom|date=November 2015}} The main philosophical debate has been between absolute and relational conceptions of motion.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-theories/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology===

===Evolution===

===Scale relativity===

===Quantum physics===
Questions of the nature of motion continue to arise in modern physics, with many of the issues of concern to early thinkers arising in different form. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the clinamen of the Epicureans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29884">{{Economic anthropology}}
{{Anthropology}}
'''Political Economy''' in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[Historical Materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political Economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Most anthropologists moved away from modes of production analysis typical of structural Marxism, and focused instead on the complex historical relations of class, culture and hegemony in regions undergoing complex colonial and capitalist transitions in the emerging world system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political Economy was introduced in American anthropology primarily through the support of [[Julian Steward]], a student of [[Alfred L. Kroeber|Kroeber]]. Steward’s research interests centered on “subsistence” — the dynamic interaction of man, environment, technology, social structure, and the organization of work. This emphasis on subsistence and production - as opposed to exchange - is what distinguishes the Political Economy approach. Steward's most theoretically productive years were from 1946-1953, while teaching at [[Columbia University]].  At this time, Columbia saw an influx of [[World War II]] [[veteran]]s who were attending school thanks to the [[GI Bill]]. Steward quickly developed a coterie of students who would go on to develop Political Economy as a distinct approach in anthropology, including [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Eric Wolf]], [[Eleanor Leacock]], [[Roy Rappaport]], [[Stanley Diamond]], Robert Manners, [[Morton Fried]], [[Robert F. Murphy (anthropologist)|Robert F. Murphy]], and influenced other scholars such as [[Elman Service]], [[Marvin Harris]] and June Nash. Many of these students participated in the Puerto Rico Project, a large-scale group research study that focused on modernization in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Anthropologies and Histories: essays in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutcgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=146–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes. Sahlins' work on hunter-gatherers as the "original affluent society" did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"/&gt;

More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

Cultural materialism is a research orientation introduced by [[Marvin Harris]] in 1968 (''The Rise of Anthropological Theory''),&lt;ref name=Harris2001a&gt;{{citation |date=2001a |origyear=1968 |author=Harris, Marvin |authorlink=Marvin Harris |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |place=Walnut Creek, California |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=0-7591-0132-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUUYN3X18dwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Rise+Anthropological+Theory&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KySLTMqBFI2IvgOjtY0Y&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a theoretical paradigm and research strategy.

Harris' approach was influenced by but distinct from Marx. Harris' method was to demonstrate how particular cultural practices (like the Hindu prohibition on harming cattle) served a materialistic function (such as preserving an essential source of fertilizer from being consumed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Marvin|title=Cows, pigs, wars &amp; witches; the riddles of culture|year=1974|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic behavior has a cultural side which indicates that the works of anthropologists is relevant to economics. The Motivation behind cultural materialism is mainly to show that cultures adapt to the environment they're produced in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Materialism and Institutional Economics|last=Jackson|first=William|publisher=Review of Social Economy|year=1996|isbn=|location=University of York|pages=225–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural Marxism===
{{main|Structural Marxism}}
Structural Marxism was an approach to [[Marxist philosophy]] based on [[structuralism]], primarily associated with the work of the French philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] and his students. It was influential in France during the 1960s and 1970s, and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and anthropologists outside France during the 1970s. French structuralist Marxism melded Marxist political economy with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Levi-Strauss]]'s [[Structuralism|structural]] methodology, eliminating the human subject, dialectical reason and history in the process. Structural Marxists introduced two major concepts, mode of production and social formation, that allowed for a more prolonged and uneven transition to capitalism than either dependency or World systems theory allowed for.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"/&gt; A [[mode of production]] consisting of producers, non-producers and [[means of production]], combined in a variety of ways, formed the deep structure of a "social formation." A social formation combined (or "articulated") several modes of production, only one of which was dominant or determinant. Primary anthropological theorists of this school included [[Maurice Godelier]], [[Claude Meillassoux]], Emmanuel Terray and Pierre-Philippe Rey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Chris Hann]]|first=[[Keith Hart (anthropologist)|Keith Hart]]|title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=73–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural Marxism arose in opposition to the [[Marxist humanism|humanistic Marxism]] that dominated many western universities during the 1970s. In contrast to Humanistic Marxism, Althusser stressed that Marxism was a [[science]] that examined objective structures.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, L. (1971). Lenin and Philosophy. In ''Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays''. NY: Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural materialism===
Critical influences on Structural Marxism, primarily from the British Marxist historical tradition, included [[E. P. Thompson|E.P. Thompson]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]] and [[Raymond Williams]]. They criticized the functionalist emphasis in Structural Marxism, that neglected individuals in favour of the structural elements of their model. The British school was more interested in class, culture and politics, and placed human subjects at the centre of analysis. Where mode of production analysis was abstract, they focused on people. Where world-systems theory had little to say about the local, the Cultural Materialists began and ended there. Others connected with this school of thought concentrated on issues such as ethnic formation, labor migration, remittances, household formation, food production and the processes of colonialism.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 172"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=172|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The anthropology of pre-capitalist societies ==
[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumbnail|Dobe !Kung men lighting a fire.]]
{{main|Original affluent society}}
As anthropologists embraced "mode of production" analysis in the 1950s, they struggled to adapt its evolutionary model to the groups that they had traditionally worked with. While Marxist analysis was developed to account for capitalist society and its class dynamics, it had little to say about "pre-capitalist" societies, other than to define them by what they were not.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 172"/&gt; One of the first attempts to theorize [[Hunter-gatherer]] society was [[Marshall Sahlins]] ''Stone Age Economics'' (1972) which overturned nineteenth century ideas that characterized life in such societies as "nasty, brutish and short". Sahlins demonstrated that actual existing hunter-gatherers lived in "the original affluent society"; their needs were met with relatively little work leaving them with far more leisure time than western industrial societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chris Hann|first=Keith Hart|title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard B. Lee|Richard B. Lee's]] work amongst the [[ǃKung people|Dobe !Kung]] of Botswana provided a detailed case study of the argument, even in one of the most hostile desert environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Richard B.|title=The Dobe Ju/'hoansi 3rd edition|year=2002|publisher=Wadsworth Thomson|location=Belmont CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second part of Sahlins' book applies Chayanov's theories to develop a theory of a "Domestic mode of production." Given the argument of the "original affluent society" that many of these societies had abundant resources, Sahlins argued that the limit on production was the amount of labour available. Young families with many dependent children had to work harder, whereas older families with mature children and many workers worked much less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Durrenberger|first=Paul|title=A Shower of Rain: Marshall Sahlins's Stone Age Economics Twenty-five years later|journal=Culture &amp; Agriculture|year=1998|volume=20|issue=2/3|pages=103–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final sections developed a theory of reciprocity discussed above.

An alternate model of the Domestic Mode of Production was developed by Eric Wolf, who rejected the evolutionary implications of Sahlins' model and argued that this mode of production should be viewed as the product of developing colonial trade relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=131–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several collections addressing the question of mode of production analysis in classless societies came out in this period, including "''The Anthropology of Pre-Capitalist Societies''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joel Kahn|first=Joseph Llobera|title=The Anthropology of Pre-capitalist Societies|year=1981|publisher=Macmillan|location=Basingstoke}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "''Marxist Analysis and Social Anthropology''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maurice Bloch ed.|title=Marxist analysis and Social Anthropology|year=1975|publisher=Tavistock|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the state==
{{main|State formation}}
Political economists such as [[Morton Fried]], [[Elman Service]], and [[Eleanor Leacock]] took a Marxist approach and sought to understand the origins and development of inequality in human society. Marx and Engels had drawn on the ethnographic work of [[Lewis H. Morgan]], and these authors now extended that tradition. In particular, they were interested in the evolution of social systems over time.

==Colonialism and imperialism==
[[File:Rhodes and Africa from Cairo to Cape Town.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cecil Rhodes, driving force of British imperialism in Africa]]

===Articulated modes of production===
The articulation of modes of production within a single formation was meant to account for the influence of colonialism on lineage modes of production, primarily in the African context. According to Hann and Hart, the short lived success of the theory was that

&lt;blockquote&gt;it produced a version of structural-functionalism at once sufficiently different from the original to persuade English-speakers that they were learning Marxism and similar enough to allow them to retain their customary way of thinking, which had been temporarily discredited by its role in the administration of empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chris Hann|first=Keith Hart|title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===World-systems theory and dependency theory===
{{main|World-systems theory|Dependency theory}}
Dependency Theory arose as a theory in Latin America in reaction to [[modernization theory]]. It argues that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and underdeveloped states to a "core" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[World-system]]" and hence poor countries will not follow Rostow's predicted path of modernization. Dependency Theory rejected Rostow's view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and [[structuralism|structures]] of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy and hence unable to change the system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=166|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immanuel Wallerstein's "world-systems theory" was the version of Dependency Theory that most North American anthropologists engaged with. His theories are similar to Dependency Theory, although he placed more emphasis on the system as system, and focused on the developments of the core rather than periphery. Wallerstein also provided an historical account of the development of capitalism which had been missing from Dependency Theory.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"/&gt;

Both versions of Dependency Theory were critiqued throughout the 1970s for the static historical accounts they provided. Their influence was slowly replaced by more dynamic and historically sensitive versions, such as Eric Wolf's "Europe and the People Without History."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=167|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eric Wolf and ''Europe and the people without history''===
{{main|Europe and the people without history}}
[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumbnail|left|16th-century Portuguese (blue) and Spanish (white) trade routes]]
"Europe and the people without history" is history written on a global scale, tracing the connections between communities, regions, peoples and nations that are usually treated as discrete subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book begins in 1400 with a description of the trade routes a world traveller might have encountered, the people and societies they connected, and the civilizational processes trying to incorporate them. From this, Wolf traces the emergence of Europe as a global power, and the reorganization of particular world regions for the production of goods now meant for global consumption. Wolf differs from World Systems theory in that he sees the growth of Europe until the late eighteenth century operating in a tributary framework, and not capitalism. He examines the way that colonial state structures were created to protect tributary populations involved in the silver, fur and slave trades.  Whole new "tribes" were created as they were incorporated into circuits of mercantile accumulation. The final section of the book deals with the transformation in these global networks as a result of the growth of capitalism with the industrial revolution. Factory production of textiles in England, for example transformed cotton production in the American South and Egypt, and eliminated textile production in India. All these transformations are connected in a single structural change. Each of the world's regions are examined in terms of the goods they produced in the global division of labour, as well as the mobilization and migration of whole populations (such as African slaves) to produce these goods. Wolf uses [[labor market segmentation]] to provide a historical account of the creation of ethnic segmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=127–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where World Systems theory had little to say about the periphery, Wolf's emphasis is on the people "without history" (i.e. not given a voice in western histories) and on how they were active participants in the creation of new cultural and social forms emerging in the context of commercial empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Maritime Fur Trade-WorldContext.png|thumbnail|Maritime Fur Trade, 1790-1840.]]
Wolf distinguishes between three modes of production: capitalist, kin-ordered, and tributary. Wolf does not view them as an evolutionary sequence. He begins with capitalism because he argues our understanding of kin-ordered and tributary modes is coloured by our understanding of capitalism. He argues they are not evolutionary precursors of capitalism, but the product of the encounter between the West and the Rest. In the tributary mode, direct producers possess their own means of production, but their surplus production is taken from them through extra economic means. This appropriation is usually by some form of strong or weak state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=131–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the kin-ordered mode of production, social labour is mobilized through kin relations (such as lineages), although his description makes its exact relations with tributary and capitalist modes unclear. The kin mode was further theorized by French structuralist Marxists in terms of 'articulated modes of production.' The kin-ordered mode is distinct again from Sahlins' formulation of the domestic mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unfree labour and slavery==
Liberal and neo-liberal market-based societies are predicated upon the concept of "free labour" - workers enter a labour market freely, and enter into contractual relations with employers voluntarily. "Unfree labour" - otherwise known as bond labour, debt bondage, debt peonage, and slavery, are thought to be archaic forms that will be eliminated with capitalist development. Anthropologists working in a wide variety of current situations have documented that the incidence of bonded labour is much greater than capitalist ideology would lead us to expect.&lt;ref name="Brass 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brass|first=Tom|title=Towards a Comparative Political Economy of Unfree Labour: Case Studies and Debates|year=1999|publisher=Frank Cass|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: The first 5,000 years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=349–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Brass argues that unfree labour is not an archaic holdover in today's world, but an active process of deproletarianization of agricultural workers to provide rural agrarian capitalists with cheaper labour. In the constant drive to cheapen the cost of agricultural labour, debt bondage is used to tie workers to specific employers, lower their wages, and extract further unpaid labour from them. He illustrates this process at work in Peru and India.&lt;ref name="Brass 1999"/&gt;

An early study of debt bondage was [[Ann Laura Stoler]]'s ''Capitalism and Confrontation in Sumatra's Plantation Belt, 1870-1979'' (1985). Stoler examined the tobacco plantations of the Deli Maatschappij, one of the most profitable Dutch colonial corporations of the 19th century. The Deli company imported large numbers of Chinese indentured labourers to [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], where they were treated not as employees, but as contractors. As contractors they had to buy all their supplies at inflated prices from the company, take all the risks of cultivation and processing, and finally sell their tobacco to the company at prices it set. They were kept in perpetual debt, unable to change employers, in working conditions that resulted in extraordinarily high death rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoler|first=Ann|title=Capitalism and Confrontation in Sumatra's Plantation Belt, 1870-1979|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Breman extended this analysis of the "Coolie regulation" (which allowed for indentured labour) to the Dutch mining industry in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (Indonesia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breman|first=Jan|title=Taming the Coolie Beast : Plantation Society and the Colonial Order in Southeast Asia|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery is but one form of unfree (or bound) labour. Structural Marxists sought to theorize it as a mode of production. Claude Meillassoux has refined this approach in his study of pre-colonial African slavery. He analyzed the military and aristocratic systems that organized the capture of slaves and situated it within the politics of the merchants who organized the trade in slaves. His work focuses on the forces at play within a kinship organized polity that define slaves culturally as "anti-kin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meillassoux|first=Claude|title=The Anthropology of Slavery: The Womb of Iron and Gold|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peasant studies and agrarian change==

==="Differentiation of the Peasantry": Lenin vs Chayanov===
{{main|Alexander Chayanov}}

===Simple commodity production and the peasantry===
{{main|Simple commodity production}}
Simple commodity production (also known as "petty commodity production") is a term coined by [[Frederick Engels]] to describe productive activities under the conditions of what Marx had called the "simple exchange" of [[commodities]], where independent producers such as peasants trade their own products. The use of the word "simple" does not refer to the nature of the producers or of their production, but to the relatively simple and straightforward exchange processes involved. Simple commodity production is compatible with many ''different'' relations of production, ranging from [[self-employment]] where the producer owns his means of production, and family labour, to forms of [[slavery]], [[peonage]], [[indentured labour]], and [[serfdom]].

===Capitalist transitions and agrarian change===
{{main|Anthropology of development}}
Michael Taussig, for example, examined the reactions of peasant farmers in Columbia as they struggled to understand how money could make interest. Taussig highlights that we have [[Commodity fetishism|fetishized]] money. We view money as an active agent, capable of doing things, of growth. In viewing money as an active agent, we obscure the social relationships that actually give money its power. The Columbian peasants, seeking to explain how money could bear interest, turned to folk beliefs like the "baptism of money" to explain how money could grow. Dishonest individuals would have money baptized, which would then become an active agent; whenever used to buy goods, it would escape the till and return to its owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taussig|first=Michael|title=The Genesis of Capitalism Amongst a South American Peasantry: Devil's Labor and the Baptism of Money|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|year=1977|volume=19|issue=2|pages=130–155|doi=10.1017/S0010417500008586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peasant wars of the twentieth century===
Written in 1969 by [[Eric Wolf]], ''Peasant Wars of the Twentieth Century'', is a comparative view of the [[peasant]] [[revolution]]s of [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Algeria]], and [[Cuba]].

===The moral economy of the peasant===
The concept of a [[moral economy]] was first elaborated by English historian [[E.P. Thompson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was developed further in anthropological studies of other peasant economies. Thompson wrote of the moral economy of the poor in the context of widespread food riots in the English countryside in the late eighteenth century. According to Thompson these riots were generally peaceable acts that demonstrated a common political culture rooted in feudal rights to “set the price” of essential goods in the market. These peasants held that a traditional “fair price” was more important to the community than a “free” market price and they punished large farmers who sold their surpluses at higher prices outside the village while there were still those in need within the village. The notion of a non-capitalist cultural mentalité using the market for its own ends has been linked by others (with Thompson's approval) to subsistence agriculture and the need for subsistence insurance in hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cambodiaricefarming1.jpg|thumbnail|Cambodian rice farming]]
The concept was widely popularized in anthropology through the book, "The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia" by [[James C. Scott]] (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=James C.|title=The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|year=1976|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book begins with a telling metaphor of peasants being like a man standing up to his nose in water; the smallest wave will drown him. Similarly, peasants generally live so close to the subsistence line that it takes little to destroy their livelihoods. From this, he infers a set of economic principles that it would be rational for them to live by. It is important to emphasize that this book was not based on fieldwork, and itself proposed a cross-cultural universalistic model of peasant economic behaviour based upon a set of fixed theoretical principles, not a reading of peasant culture. Firstly, he argued that peasants were "risk averse", or, put differently, followed a "safety first" principle. They would not adopt risky new seeds or technologies, no matter how promising, because tried and true traditional methods had demonstrated, not promised, effectiveness. This gives peasants an unfair reputation as "traditionalist" when in fact they are just risk averse. Secondly, Scott argues that peasant society provides "subsistence insurance" for its members to tide them over those occasions when natural or man-made disaster strikes. Although fieldwork has not supported many of Scott's conclusions, the book encouraged a generation of researchers.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6325">A '''position paper''' is an essay that presents an arguable [[opinion]] about an issue – typically that of the author or some specified entity. Position papers are published in academia, in politics, in law and other domains. The goal of a position paper is to convince the audience that the opinion presented is valid and worth listening to. Ideas for position papers that one is considering need to be carefully examined when choosing a topic, developing an argument, and organizing the paper. 

Position papers range from the simplest format of a [[letter to the editor]], through to the most complex in the form of an academic position paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sanders|Tingloo|Verhulst|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-gBH7BQqy_0C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;vq=%22The+simplest+form+is+the+letter+to+the+editor%22&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U3rDMBciOi4ZB2l3gHAbnCLMSb0Kg 11]}}, "The simplest form is the letter to the editor...

== In academia ==
Position papers in academia enable discussion on emerging topics without the experimentation and original research normally present in an [[academic paper]]. Commonly, such a document will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward with evidence from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.

== In politics ==
Position papers are most useful in contexts where detailed comprehension of another entity's views is important; as such, they are commonly used by political campaigns,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steely|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gZUNJPsV9i0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22The+Gentleman+from+Georgia:%22+%22The+Biography+of+Newt+Gingrich%22&amp;ei=-9mxSKLpCIPctAOFkdHaBA&amp;sig=ACfU3U30RgMIjhbEY1SMSUxGE9c2nfihkQ#PRA1-PA186,M1 186]}}, "Through the use of position papers, telephone briefings, audio and video tapes and personal appearances Newt was able to share his ideas, ... ."&lt;/ref&gt; government organizations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In government, a position paper lies on somewhere between a [[white paper]] and a [[green paper]] in that they affirm definite opinions and propose solutions but may not go so far as detailing specific plans for implementation.

== In law ==
In [[international law]], the term for a position paper is [[Aide-mémoire]]. An Aide-Mémoire is memorandum setting forth the minor points of a proposed discussion or disagreement, used especially in undiplomatic communications.

'''Puberty''' is the process of physical changes through which a [[child]]'s [[Human body|body]] matures into an [[adult]] body capable of [[sexual reproduction]]. It is initiated by [[hormone|hormonal]] signals from the [[brain]] to the [[gonad]]s: the [[ovary|ovaries]] in a girl, the [[testis|testes]] in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate [[libido]] and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, [[bone]]s, [[muscle]], [[blood]], [[skin]], [[human hair growth|hair]], [[breast]]s, and [[sex organ]]s. [[Human development (biology)|Physical growth]]—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs.

On average, girls begin puberty around ages 10–11 and end puberty around 15–17; boys begin around ages 11–12 and end around 16–17.&lt;ref name="Kail"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kail |first=RV |author2=Cavanaugh JC |title=Human Development: A Lifespan View |isbn=978-0495600374 |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |year=2010 |accessdate=September 11, 2014 |page=296 |edition=5th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-n5E7oyCgoC&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pamf.org"&gt;"For girls, puberty begins around 10 or 11 years of age and ends around age 16.

Notable among the [[morphology (biology)|morphologic]] changes in size, shape, composition, and functioning of the pubertal body, is the development of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s, the "filling in" of the child's body; from girl to woman, from boy to man. Derived from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|puberatum}}'' (age of maturity), the word ''puberty'' describes the physical changes to sexual maturation, not the [[psychosocial]] and cultural maturation denoted by the term ''adolescent development'' in [[Western culture]], wherein [[adolescence]] is the period of mental transition from childhood to [[adult]]hood, which overlaps much of the body's period of puberty.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'', C.

Two of the most significant differences between puberty in girls and puberty in boys are the age at which it begins, and the major [[sex steroid]]s involved, the testosterones and the estrogens.

Although there is a wide range of normal ages, girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11; boys at ages 11–12.&lt;ref name="Kail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pamf.org" /&gt; Girls usually complete puberty by ages 15–17,&lt;ref name="pamf.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pamf.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Puberty" /&gt; while boys usually complete puberty by ages 16–17.&lt;ref name="pamf.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pamf.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall17677" /&gt; Girls attain reproductive maturity about four years after the first physical changes of puberty appear.&lt;ref name="Puberty" /&gt; In contrast, boys accelerate more slowly but continue to grow for about six years after the first visible pubertal changes.&lt;ref name="Garn"&gt;Garn, SM. Physical growth and development. In: Friedman SB, Fisher M, Schonberg SK., editors. Comprehensive Adolescent Health Care. St Louis: Quality Medical Publishing; 1992. Retrieved on 2009-02-20&lt;/ref&gt; Any increase in height beyond the post-pubertal age is uncommon.

For boys, the [[androgen]] [[testosterone]] is the principal [[sex hormone]]; while testosterone is produced, all boys' changes  are characterized as [[virilization]]. A substantial product of testosterone metabolism in males is [[estradiol]]. The conversion of testosterone to estradiol depends on the amount of body fat and estradiol levels in boys are typically much lower than in girls. The male "growth spurt" also begins later, accelerates more slowly, and lasts longer before the [[epiphyses]] fuse. Although boys are on average {{convert|2|cm|in|1}} shorter than girls before puberty begins, adult men are on average about {{convert|13|cm|in}} taller than women. Most of this sex difference in adult heights is attributable to a later onset of the growth spurt and a slower progression to completion, a direct result of the later rise and lower adult male levels of estradiol.&lt;ref name=abbassi1998&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abbassi V | title = Growth and normal puberty. | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 102 | issue = 2 Pt 3 | pages = 507–513 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9685454 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hormone that dominates female development is an [[estrogen]] called [[estradiol]]. While estradiol promotes growth of the breasts and [[uterus]], it is also the principal hormone driving the pubertal growth spurt and [[epiphyses|epiphyseal]] maturation and closure.&lt;ref name=macgillivray1998&gt;{{cite journal | author = MacGillivray MH, Morishima A, Conte F, Grumbach M, Smith EP | title = Pediatric endocrinology update: an overview. The essential roles of estrogens in pubertal growth, epiphyseal fusion and bone turnover: lessons from mutations in the genes for aromatase and the estrogen receptor | journal = Hormone Research | volume = 49 Suppl 1 | pages = 2–8 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9554463 | last2 = Morishima | last3 = Conte | last4 = Grumbach | last5 = Smith | doi = 10.1159/000053061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estradiol levels rise earlier and reach higher levels in women than in men.

The hormonal maturation of females is considerably more complicated than in boys. The main [[steroid hormone]]s, testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone as well as [[prolactin]] play important physiological functions in puberty.
Gonadal steroidgenesis in girls starts with production of testosterone which is typically quickly converted to estradiol inside the ovaries. However the rate of conversion from testosterone to estradiol (driven by FSH/LH balance) during early puberty is highly individual, resulting in very diverse development patterns of [[secondary sexual characteristics]]. Production of progesterone in the ovaries begins with the development of ovulatory cycles in girls (during the lutheal phase of the cycle), before puberty low levels of [[progesterone]] are produced in the adrenal glands of both boys and girls.

==Puberty onset==
Puberty is preceded by [[adrenarche]], marking an increase of adrenal androgen production between ages 6–10. Adrenarche is  sometimes accompanied by the early appearance of axillary and pubic hair. The first androgenic hair resulting from adrenarche can be also transient and disappear before the onset of true puberty.

The onset of puberty is associated with high [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] pulsing, which precedes the rise in sex hormones, [[Luteinizing Hormone|LH]] and [[Follicle Stimulating Hormone|FSH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Plant TM | title = Leptin, growth hormone, and the onset of primate puberty. | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 86 | issue = 1 | pages = 458–460 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11232044 | doi = 10.1210/jc.86.1.459 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exogenous GnRH pulses cause the onset of puberty.&lt;ref&gt;Essential Reproduction, M Johnson, Blackwell Publishers, 6th Rev Ed edition (29 Jun 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Brain tumors which increase GnRH output may also lead to premature puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Precocious Puberty |publisher=MERCK |url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/pediatrics/endocrine_disorders_in_children/precocious_puberty.html?qt=&amp;sc=&amp;alt= |date=May 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of the GnRH rise is unknown. [[Leptin]] might be the cause of the GnRH rise. Leptin has receptors in the hypothalamus which synthesizes GnRH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meister B, Håkansson ML | title = Leptin receptors in hypothalamus and circumventricular organs | journal = Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology &amp; Physiology | volume = 28 | issue = 7 | pages = 610–617 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11458889 | doi = 10.1046/j.1440-1681.2001.03493.x | last2 = Håkansson }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who are deficient in leptin fail to initiate puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Clayton PE, Trueman JA | title = Leptin and puberty | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10868988 | pmc = 1718397 | doi = 10.1136/adc.83.1.1 | last2 = Trueman }}&lt;/ref&gt; The levels of leptin increase with the onset of puberty, and then decline to adult levels when puberty is completed. The rise in GnRH might also be caused by genetics. A study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Topaloglu AK, Reimann F, Guclu M, Yalin AS, Kotan LD, Porter KM, Serin A, Mungan NO, Cook JR, Ozbek MN, Imamoglu S, Akalin NS, Yuksel B, O'Rahilly S, Semple RK | title = TAC3 and TACR3 mutations in familial hypogonadotropic hypogonadism reveal a key role for Neurokinin B in the central control of reproduction | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 354–358 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19079066 | doi = 10.1038/ng.306 | display-authors = 8 | last2 = Reimann | last3 = Guclu | last4 = Yalin | last5 = Kotan | last6 = Porter | last7 = Serin | last8 = Mungan | last9 = Cook | last10 = Ozbek | last11 = Imamoglu | last12 = Akalin | last13 = Yuksel | last14 = O'Rahilly | last15 = Semple | pmc = 4312696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered that a mutation in genes encoding both [[Neurokinin B]] as well as the Neurokinin B receptor can alter the timing of puberty. The researchers hypothesized that Neurokinin B might play a role in regulating the secretion of [[Kisspeptin]], a compound responsible for triggering direct release of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] as well as indirect release of [[Luteinizing Hormone|LH]] and [[Follicle Stimulating Hormone|FSH]].

=== Effects of early and late puberty onset ===
Several studies about puberty have examined the effects of an early or a late onset of puberty in males and females. In general, girls who enter puberty late experience positive outcomes in adolescence and adulthood while girls who enter puberty early experience negative outcomes. Boys who have earlier pubertal timing generally have more positive outcomes in adulthood but more negative outcomes in adolescence, while the reverse is true for later pubertal timing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Girls ====

Outcomes have generally indicated that early onset of puberty in girls can be psychologically damaging. The main reason for this detrimental effect is the issue of [[body image]]. As they physically develop, gaining weight in several areas of the body, early-maturing girls usually look larger than girls who have not yet entered puberty. A result of the social pressure to be thin, the early-maturing girls develop a negative view of their body image. In addition, people may tease the girls about their visible breasts, forcing the early-maturing girl to hide her breasts by dressing differently. Embarrassment about a more developed body may also result in the refusal to undress for gym. These experiences lead to lower self-esteem, more depression and poorer body image in these early-maturing girls.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Furthermore, as physical and emotional differences set them apart from people in their same age group, early-maturing girls develop relationships with older people. For instance, some early-maturing girls have older boyfriends, "attracted to the girls' womanly physique and girlish innocence."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While having an older boyfriend might improve popularity among peers, it also increases the risk of alcohol and drug use, increased sexual relations (often unprotected), eating disorders and bullying.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Generally, later onset of puberty in girls produces positive outcomes. They exhibit positive behaviors in adolescence that continue to adulthood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Boys ====
In the past, early onset of puberty in boys has been associated with positive outcomes, such as leadership in high school and success in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Longitudinal Investigation of Associations Between Boys' Pubertal Timing and Adult Behavioral Health and Well-Being|last = Taga|first = Keiko A.|date = 3 May 2006|journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence|accessdate = |doi = 10.1007/s10964-006-9039-4|volume=35|issue = 3|pages=380–390}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent studies have revealed that the risks and problems of early maturation in males might outweigh the benefits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Early-maturing boys develop "more aggressive, law-breaking, and alcohol abusing" behaviors, which result in anger towards parents and trouble in school and with the police. Early puberty also correlates with increased sexual activity and a higher instance of teenage pregnancy, both of which can lead to depression and other psychosocial issues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  However, early puberty might also result in positive outcomes, such as popularity among peers, higher self-esteem and confidence, as a result of physical developments, such as taller height, developed muscles, muscular male breast and better athletic ability.

On the other hand, late-maturing boys develop lower self-esteem and confidence and generally have lower popularity among peers, due to their less-developed physiques. Also, they experience problems with anxiety and depression and are more likely to be afraid of sex than other boys.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Changes in males==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2009}}
{{see also|Tanner scale}}

===Size and virility===
In boys, testicular enlargement is the first physical manifestation of puberty (and is termed [[gonadarche]]).&lt;ref&gt;Styne (2002), p. 598&lt;/ref&gt; [[Testes]] in prepubertal boys change little in size from about 1 year of age to the onset of puberty, averaging about 2–3&amp;nbsp;cm in length and about 1.5–2&amp;nbsp;cm in width. The size of the testicles is among the parameters of the [[Tanner scale#Genitals (male)|Tanner scale for male genitals]], from stage I which represents a volume of less than 1.5 ml, to stage V which represents a testicular volume of greater than 20 ml. Testicular size reaches maximal adult size about 6 years after the onset of puberty.  While 18–20&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is an average adult size, there is wide variation in testicular size in the normal population.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1986), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; After the boy's testicles have enlarged and developed for about one year, the length and then the breadth of the shaft of the [[human penis|penis]] will increase and the [[glans penis]] and corpora cavernosa will also start to enlarge to adult proportions.&lt;ref name=jonessmiths&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jones, Kenneth W.|title=Smith's Recognizable Patterns of Human Malformation|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=St. Louis, Mo|year=2006|pages=|isbn=978-0-7216-0615-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The testes have two primary functions: to produce [[hormone]]s and to produce [[spermatozoon|sperm]]. The [[Leydig cell]]s produce [[testosterone]], which in turn produces most of the male pubertal changes. Most of the increasing bulk of testicular tissue is spermatogenic tissue (primarily [[Sertoli cell|Sertoli]] and [[Leydig cell]]s).

===Male musculature and body shape===
By the end of puberty, adult men have heavier [[bone]]s and nearly twice as much skeletal [[muscle]]. Some of the bone growth (e.g. shoulder width and jaw) is disproportionately greater, resulting in noticeably different male and female skeletal shapes. The average adult male has about 150% of the lean body mass of an average female, and about 50% of the body fat.

This muscle develops mainly during the later stages of puberty, and muscle growth can continue even after boys are biologically adult. The peak of the so-called "strength spurt", the rate of muscle growth, is attained about one year after a male experiences his peak growth rate.

Often, the fat pads of the male breast tissue and the male nipples will develop during puberty; sometimes, especially in one breast, this becomes more apparent and is termed [[gynecomastia]]. It is usually not a permanent phenomenon.

===Erections===
[[Erection]]s during sleep or when waking up are medically known as [[nocturnal penile tumescence]] and colloquially referred to as ''morning wood''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://h2g2.com/approved_entry/A12219374 h2g2 - The Morning Glory (or Nocturnal Penile Tumescence)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The penis can regularly get erect during sleep and men or boys often wake up with an erection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5f8mQx7ULs4C&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u1TwTu20EYTc8QOEmPiiAQ&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity: Embracing Diversity - Janell L.

===Foreskin retraction===
During puberty, if not before, the tip and opening of a boy's [[foreskin]] becomes wider, progressively allowing for retraction down the shaft of the [[Human penis|penis]] and behind the [[glans penis|glans]], which ultimately should be possible without pain or difficulty. The membrane that bonds the inner surface of the foreskin with the glans disintegrates and releases the foreskin to separate from the glans. The foreskin then gradually becomes retractable.&lt;ref name="Øster"&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Øster J | title = Further Fate of the Foreskin: Incidence of Preputial Adhesions, Phimosis, and Smegma among Danish Schoolboys | journal = Arch Dis Child | volume = 43 | pages = 200–202 | date = April 1968 | pmid = 5689532 | pmc = 2019851 | doi = 10.1136/adc.43.228.200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Øster (1968) found that with the onset and continuation of puberty, the proportion of boys able to pull back their foreskins increased. At ages 12–13, Øster found that only 60% of boys were able to retract their foreskins; this increased to 85% by ages 14–15, and 95% by 16–17. He also found that 1% of those unable to fully retract experienced [[phimosis]] at ages 14–17, the remainder were partially able to.&lt;ref name="Øster" /&gt; The findings were supported by further research by Kayaba ''et al'' (1996) on a sample of over 600 boys,&lt;ref name="Kayaba"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Kayaba H, Tamura H, Kitajima S, Fujiwara Y, Kato T, Kato T | title = Analysis of Shape and Retractability of the Prepuce in 603 Japanese Boys | journal = J Urol | volume = 156 | issue = 5 | pages = 1813–1815 | date = November 1996 | pmid = 8863623 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5347(01)65544-7 | publisher = American Urological Association, Inc. | others = Hiromi Tamura, Seiichi Kitajima, Yoshiyuki Fujiwara, Tetsuo Kato and Tetsuro Kato }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ishikawa and Kawakita (2004) found that by age 15, 77% of their sample of boys could retract their foreskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal| author =Ishikawa E, Kawakita M |last2=. |title=Preputial development in Japanese boys |journal= Hinyokika Kiyo |year= 2004 |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=305–8|pmid= 15237481}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beaugé (1997) reports that boys may assist the development of retractile foreskin by manual stretching.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |
author=Beaugé M | title=The causes of adolescent phimosis | journal=Br J Sex Med  | date=1997 | volume= | issue=Sept/Oct | pages=26 | doi= | pmid= | pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a boy is able to retract his foreskin, penile hygiene should become an important feature of his routine body care. Although the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] states there is "little evidence to affirm the association between circumcision status and optimal penile hygiene",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Circumcision Policy Statement | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 103 | issue = 3 | pages = 686–93 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10049981 | doi = 10.1542/peds.103.3.686 }}&lt;/ref&gt; various studies suggest that boys be educated about the role of hygiene, including retracting the foreskin while urinating and rinsing under it and around the glans at each bathing opportunity. Regular washing under the foreskin was found by Krueger and Osborn (1986) to reduce the risk of numerous penile disorders,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Krueger H, Osborn L | title = Effects of hygiene among the uncircumcised. | journal = J Fam Pract | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 353–5 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3958682 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however Birley et al. (1993) report excessive washing with soap should be avoided because it dries the oils out of the tissues and can cause non-specific dermatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal | author=Birley HDL, Luzzi GA, Bell R | title= Clinical features and management of recurrent balanitis: association with atopy and genital washing | journal=Genitourin Med  | date=1993 | volume=69 | issue=5 | pages=400–3 | url= | doi= 10.1136/sti.69.5.400| pmid= 8244363  | pmc= 1195128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pubic hair===
[[Pubic hair]] often appears on a boy shortly after the genitalia begin to grow.  The pubic hairs are usually first visible at the dorsal (abdominal) base of the penis. The first few hairs are described as stage 2. Stage 3 is usually reached within another 6–12 months, when the hairs are too many to count. By stage 4, the pubic hairs densely fill the "pubic triangle." Stage 5 refers to the spread of pubic hair to the [[thigh]]s and upward towards the [[navel]] as part of the developing [[abdominal hair]].

===Body and facial hair===
[[Image:Stubbly face.jpg|right|thumb|[[Facial hair]] of a male.]]
In the months and years following the appearance of pubic hair, other areas of skin that respond to androgens may develop [[androgenic hair]]. The usual sequence is: [[underarm]] (axillary) hair, [[perianal hair]], [[moustache|upper lip hair]], [[sideburn]] (preauricular) hair, periareolar hair, and the [[beard]] area.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite news|title=Puberty -- Changes for Males|publisher=pamf.org|accessdate=2009-02-20 |url=http://www.pamf.org/teen/health/puberty/physicalchanges.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with most human biological processes, this specific order may vary among some individuals. Arm, leg, [[chest hair|chest]], [[abdominal hair|abdominal]], and back hair become heavier more gradually. There is a large range in amount of body hair among adult men, and significant differences in timing and quantity of hair growth among different racial groups. Facial hair is often present in late adolescence, but may not appear until significantly later.&lt;ref name="www.ppwr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting The Facts: Puberty|publisher=ppwr|accessdate=2009-02-20|url=http://www.ppwr.on.ca/03_07.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104233250/http://www.ppwr.on.ca/03_07.html|archivedate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbskids.org"&gt;{{Cite news|title=The No-Hair Scare|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2009-02-20|url=http://pbskids.org/itsmylife/body/puberty/article7.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205115944/http://pbskids.org/itsmylife/body/puberty/article7.html|archivedate=2009-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facial hair will continue to get coarser, darker and thicker for another 2–4 years after puberty.&lt;ref name=www.ppwr/&gt; Some men do not develop full facial hair for up to 10 years after the completion of puberty.&lt;ref name=www.ppwr/&gt; Chest hair may appear during puberty or years after, though not all men develop it.

===Voice change and Adam's apple===
{{main|Voice change}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of voice disorders]] --&gt;
Under the influence of androgens, the voice box, or [[larynx]], [[Laryngeal prominence|grows]] in both sexes. This growth is far more prominent in boys, causing the male voice to drop and deepen, sometimes abruptly but rarely "overnight," about one [[octave]], because the longer and thicker [[vocal folds]] have a lower [[fundamental frequency]]. Before puberty, the larynx of boys and girls is about equally small.&lt;ref name="www.britannica.com"&gt;{{Cite news|title=The structure of the larynx|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=2009-02-20|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/559032/speech/68966/The-structure-of-the-larynx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, voice change is accompanied by unsteadiness of vocalization in the early stages of untrained voices. Most of the voice change happens during stage 3-4 of male puberty around the time of peak growth. Adult pitch is attained at an average age of 15 years, although the voice may not fully settle until early twenties. It usually precedes the development of significant facial hair by several months to years.

==Changes in females==

===Breast development===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Poitrine.jpg|thumb|left|Developing [[breasts]] in stage 4 of 5, with noticeable secondary mounds]] --&gt;
The first physical sign of puberty in girls is usually a firm, tender lump under the center of the [[areola]] of one or both [[breast]]s, occurring on average at about 10.5 years of age.&lt;ref name="Marshall187"&gt;Marshall (1986), p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; This is referred to as [[thelarche]]. By the widely used [[Tanner stages|Tanner staging]] of puberty, this is stage 2 of breast development (stage 1 is a flat, prepubertal breast). Within six to 12 months, the swelling has clearly begun in both sides, softened, and can be felt and seen extending beyond the edges of the areolae. This is stage 3 of breast development. By another 12 months (stage 4), the breasts are approaching mature size and shape, with areolae and [[nipple]]s forming a secondary mound. In most young women, this mound disappears into the contour of the mature breast (stage 5), although there is so much variation in sizes and shapes of adult breasts that stages 4 and 5 are not always separately identifiable.&lt;ref name="Marshall188"&gt;Marshall (1986), p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pubic hair===
[[Pubic hair]] is often the second noticeable change in puberty, usually within a few months of thelarche.&lt;ref name=tanner85&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tanner JM, Davies PS | title = Clinical longitudinal standards for height and height velocity for North American children. | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 107 | issue = 3 | pages = 317–329 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3875704 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3476(85)80501-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is referred to as [[pubarche]]. The pubic hairs are usually visible first along the [[labium (genitalia)|labia]]. The first few hairs are described as Tanner stage 2.&lt;ref name="Marshall188"/&gt; Stage 3 is usually reached within another 6–12 months, when the hairs are too numerous to count and appear on the [[mons pubis|pubic mound]] as well. By stage 4, the pubic hairs densely fill the "pubic triangle." Stage 5 refers to spread of pubic hair to the [[thigh]]s and sometimes as [[abdominal hair]] upward towards the [[navel]]. In about 15% of girls, the earliest pubic hair appears before breast development begins.&lt;ref name=tanner85/&gt;

===Vagina, uterus, ovaries===
[[Perineum|Perineal]] skin [[keratin]]izes due to effect of estrogen increasing its resistance to infection. The [[mucosal membrane|mucosal]] [[Vagina#Layers, regions and histology|surface]] of the vagina also changes in response to increasing levels of [[estrogen]], becoming thicker and duller pink in color (in contrast to the brighter red of the prepubertal vaginal mucosa).&lt;ref&gt;Gordon (2005), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Mucosa changes into a multilayered structure with superficial layer of squamous cells. Estrogen increase glycogen content in [[vaginal epithelium]], which in future plays important part in maintaining [[Vaginal ph|vaginal pH]]. Whitish secretions (physiologic [[leukorrhea]]) are a normal effect of estrogen as well.&lt;ref name="Marshall187"/&gt; In the two years following thelarche, the [[uterus]], [[ovary|ovaries]], and the [[ovarian follicle|follicles]] in the ovaries increase in size.&lt;ref name="Marshall1867"&gt;Marshall (1986), p. 186–7&lt;/ref&gt; The ovaries usually contain small follicular [[cyst]]s visible by [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfield (2002), p. 462&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1584537"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siegel MJ, Surratt JT | title = Pediatric gynecologic imaging. | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 103–127 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1584537 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before puberty, uterine body to cervix ratio is 1:1; which increases to 2:1 or 3:1 after completion of pubertal period.

===Menstruation and fertility===
The first [[menstrual cycle|menstrual bleeding]] is referred to as [[menarche]], and typically occurs about two years after [[thelarche]].&lt;ref name=tanner85/&gt; The average age of menarche is 12.5 in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="U.S. menarche"/&gt; Most American girls experience their first period at 11, 12 or 13, but some experience it earlier than their 11th birthday and others after their 14th birthday. In fact, anytime between 8 and 16 is normal. In [[Canada]], the average age of menarche is 12.72,&lt;ref name="Canadian menarche"/&gt; and in the [[United Kingdom]] it is 12.9.&lt;ref name="UK menarche"/&gt; The time between menstrual periods (menses) is not always regular in the first two years after menarche.&lt;ref name=apter80&gt;{{cite journal | author = Apter D | title = Serum steroids and pituitary hormones in female puberty: a partly longitudinal study. | journal = Clinical Endocrinology | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 107–120 | year = 1980 | pmid = 6249519 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2265.1980.tb02125.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovulation]] is necessary for [[fertility]], but may or may not accompany the earliest menses.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall (1986), p. 196-7&lt;/ref&gt; In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third year and 10% in the sixth year.&lt;ref name=apter80 /&gt; Initiation of ovulation after menarche is not inevitable. A high proportion of girls with continued irregularity in the menstrual cycle several years from menarche will continue to have prolonged irregularity and anovulation, and are at higher risk for reduced fertility.&lt;ref name=southam&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Southam AL, Richart RM | title = The prognosis for adolescents with menstrual abnormalities. | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 94 | issue = 5 | pages = 637–645 | year = 1966 | pmid = 5906589 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9378(66)90398-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body shape, fat distribution, and body composition===
During this period, also in response to rising levels of estrogen, the lower half of the [[pelvis]] and thus [[Hip (anatomy)|hips]] widen (providing a larger [[birth canal]]).&lt;ref name="Marshall188"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/hs/pubhealth/modules/reproductiveHealth/anatomy.html |title=Hips widen during female puberty  |publisher=Columbia  |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fat tissue increases to a greater percentage of the body composition than in males, especially in the typical female distribution of breasts, hips, buttocks, thighs, upper arms, and pubis. Progressive differences in fat distribution as well as sex differences in local skeletal growth contribute to the typical female body shape by the end of puberty. On average, at 10 years, girls have 6% more body fat than boys.&lt;ref&gt;Gungor (2002), pages 699-700&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body odor and acne===
Rising levels of [[androgen]]s can change the [[fatty acid]] composition of [[perspiration]], resulting in a more "adult" [[body odor]]. This often precedes thelarche and pubarche by one or more years. Another androgen effect is increased secretion of oil ([[sebum]]) from the skin. This change increases the susceptibility to [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], a skin condition that is characteristic of puberty.&lt;ref name="ros2002"&gt;Rosenfield (2002){{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acne varies greatly in its severity.&lt;ref name=ros2002/&gt;

===Visual and other effects of hormonal changes===
In girls, [[estradiol]] (the primary female sex hormone) causes thickening of lips and [[oral mucosa]] as well as further development of the [[vulva]]. In the vulva and vagina, estradiol causes thickening ([[stratified squamous epithelium|stratification]]) of the skin and the growth of both the [[myoepithelial cells|myoepithelial layer]] and the [[smooth muscle]] of the vagina. Typically estradiol will also cause pronounced growth of the [[labia minora]] and to a lesser degree of the [[labia majora]].

Estradiol is also responsible for the increased production of [[pheomelanin]], resulting in the characteristic red color of the lips, labia minora and sometimes labia majora. Estradiol together with other ovarian steroids also cause the darker coloration of the [[areola]].

Testosterone will cause an enlargement of the [[clitoris]] and possibly has important effects on the growth and maturation of the [[vestibular bulbs]], [[corpus cavernosum of clitoris|corpus cavernosum of the clitoris]] and [[urethral sponge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kalloo NB, Gearhart JP, Barrack ER | title = Sexually dimorphic expression of estrogen receptors, but not of androgen receptors in human fetal external genitalia | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 692–698 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8370691 | doi=10.1210/jcem.77.3.8370691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes of the vulva initiated by estradiol as well as its direct effects also appear to influence the functioning of the lower urinary tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersson KE, Wein AJ | title = Pharmacology of the Lower Urinary Tract: Basis for Current and Future Treatments of Urinary Incontinence | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 56 | issue = 4 | pages = 581–631 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15602011 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1124/pr.56.4.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robinson D, Cardozo L | title = Estrogens and the lower urinary tract | journal = Neurourology and Urodynamics | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 754–757 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21661025 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/nau.21106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2008}}
In a general sense, the conclusion of puberty is reproductive maturity. Criteria for defining the conclusion may differ for different purposes: attainment of the ability to reproduce, achievement of maximal adult height, maximal gonadal size, or adult sex hormone levels. Maximal adult height is achieved at an average age of 15 years for an average girl and 18 years for an average boy. Potential fertility (sometimes termed ''nubility'') usually precedes completion of growth by 1–2 years in girls and 3–4 years in boys. Stage 5 typically represents maximal gonadal growth and adult hormone levels.

===Age of onset===
The definition of the onset of puberty may depend on perspective (e.g., hormonal versus physical) and purpose (establishing population normal standards, clinical care of early or late pubescent individuals, etc.). A common definition for the onset of puberty is physical changes to a person's body.&lt;ref name="Puberty"/&gt; These physical changes are the first visible signs of neural, hormonal, and gonadal function changes.

The age at which puberty begins varies between individuals; usually, puberty begins between 10 and 13 years of age. The age at which puberty begins is affected by both genetic factors and by environmental factors such as nutritional state and social circumstances.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaplowitz PB, Slora EJ, Wasserman RC, Pedlow SE, Herman-Giddens ME | title = Earlier onset of puberty in girls: relation to increased body mass index and race. | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = 347–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11483799 | doi = 10.1542/peds.108.2.347 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of social circumstances is the [[Vandenbergh effect]]; a juvenile female who has significant interaction with adult males will enter puberty earlier than juvenile females who are not socially overexposed to adult males.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson RJ. 2005. Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology. Sinauer Associates: Massachusetts. p357.&lt;/ref&gt;

The average age at which puberty begins may be affected by race as well. For example, the average age of [[menarche]] in various populations surveyed has ranged from 12&lt;ref name="U.S. menarche"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Canadian menarche"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UK menarche"/&gt; to 18 years. The earliest average onset of puberty is for African-American girls and the latest average onset for high altitude subsistence populations in Asia. However, much of the higher age averages reflect nutritional limitations more than genetic differences and can change within a few generations with a substantial change in diet. The median age of menarche for a population may be an index of the proportion of undernourished girls in the population, and the width of the spread may reflect unevenness of wealth and food distribution in a population.

Researchers have identified an earlier age of the onset of puberty.  However, they have based their conclusions on a comparison of data from 1999 with data from 1969.  In the earlier example, the sample population was based on a small sample of white girls (200, from Britain).  The later study identified as puberty as occurring in 48% of African-American girls by age nine, and 12% of white girls by that age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://center4research.org/child-teen-health/early-puberty-and-problems-in-sexual-development/girls-to-women/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109061104/http://center4research.org/child-teen-health/early-puberty-and-problems-in-sexual-development/girls-to-women/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-11-09|title=Early Puberty in Girls|accessdate=2010-07-13|date=May 2009|last=Zuckerman|first=Diana|publisher=National Research Center for Women and Families}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One possible cause of a delay in the onset of puberty past the age 14 in girls and 15 in boys is [[Kallmann syndrome]], a form of [[hypogonadotropic hypogonadism]] (HH). Kallmann syndrome is also associated with a lack of sense of smell ([[anosmia]]).  Kallmann syndrome and other forms of HH affect both men and women. It is caused by a failure in [[HPG axis]] at puberty which results in low or zero [[gonadotropin]] ([[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] and [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]]) levels with the subsequent result of a failure to commence or complete puberty, secondary [[hypogonadism]] and [[infertility]].&lt;ref name="pmid21511493"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mitchell AL, Dwyer A, Pitteloud N, Quinton R | title = Genetic basis and variable phenotypic expression of Kallmann syndrome: towards a unifying theory. | journal = Trends Endocrinol.

====Historical shift====
The average age at which the onset of puberty occurs has dropped significantly since the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Harry|last=Finley|title=Average age at menarche in various cultures|publisher=Museum of Menstruation and Women s Health|url=http://www.mum.org/menarage.htm|work=|pages=|accessdate=2007-08-02|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Whincup PH, Gilg JA, Odoki K, Taylor SJ, Cook DG | title = Age of menarche in contemporary British teenagers: survey of girls born between 1982 and 1986 | journal = BMJ | volume = 322 | issue = 7294 | pages = 1095–6 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11337438 | pmc = 31261 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.322.7294.1095 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Girls maturing slightly earlier|date=2001-05-03|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1310280.stm|work=|pages=|accessdate=2007-08-02|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In every decade from 1840 to 1950 there was a drop of four months in the average age of menarche among Western European females. In [[Norway]], girls born in 1840 had their menarche at an average age of 17 years. In France, the average in 1840 was 15.3 years. In [[England]], the average in 1840 was 16.5 years. In [[Japan]] the decline happened later and was then more rapid: from 1945 to 1975 in Japan there was a drop of 11 months per decade.

A 2006 study in Denmark found  that puberty, as evidenced by breast development, started at an average age of 9 years and 10 months, a year earlier than when a similar study  was done in 1991.  Scientists believe the phenomenon could be linked to obesity or exposure to chemicals in the food chain, and is putting girls at greater long-term risk of breast cancer.&lt;ref&gt;

===Genetic influence and environmental factors===
Various studies have found direct genetic effects to account for at least 46% of the variation of timing of puberty in well-nourished populations.&lt;ref name="xia"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ge|first1=Xiaojia|last2=Natsuaki|first2=Misaki N.|last3=Neiderhiser|first3=Jenae M.|last4=Reiss|first4=David|title=Genetic and Environmental Influences on Pubertal Timing: Results From Two National Sibling Studies|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|volume=17|issue=4|pages=767–788|year=2007|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7795.2007.00546.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mustanski BS, Viken RJ, Kaprio J, Pulkkinen L, Rose RJ | title = Genetic and environmental influences on pubertal development: longitudinal data from Finnish twins at ages 11 and 14. | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 1188–1198 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15535766 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.40.6.1188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Treloar SA, Martin NG | title = Age at menarche as a fitness trait: nonadditive genetic variance detected in a large twin sample. | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 137–148 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2349942 | pmc = 1683767 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaprio J, Rimpelä A, Winter T, Viken RJ, Rimpelä M, Rose RJ | title = Common genetic influences on BMI and age at menarche. | journal = Human Biology; an International Record of Research | volume = 67 | issue = 5 | pages = 739–753 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8543288 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic association of timing is strongest between mothers and daughters.

Researchers&lt;ref&gt;Diana Zuckerman, "When Little Girls Become Women: Early Onset of Puberty in Girls" (This article appeared in The Ribbon, a newsletter of the Cornell University Program on Breast Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors in New York States (BCERF), Vol 6, No. 1, Winter 2001.) [https://web.archive.org/web/20131109061104/http://center4research.org/child-teen-health/early-puberty-and-problems-in-sexual-development/girls-to-women/ Early Puberty in Girls]&lt;/ref&gt; have hypothesized that early puberty onset may be caused by certain hair care products containing estrogen or placenta, and by certain chemicals, namely [[phthalate]]s, which are used in many cosmetics, toys, and plastic food containers.

If genetic factors account for half of the variation of pubertal timing, environment factors are clearly important as well. One of the first observed environmental effects is that puberty occurs later in children raised at higher altitudes. The most important of the environmental influences is clearly nutrition, but a number of others have been identified, all which affect timing of female puberty and menarche more clearly than male puberty.

====Hormones and steroids====
There is theoretical concern, and animal evidence, that environmental hormones and [[chemical]]s may affect aspects of prenatal or postnatal sexual development in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Colborn, T., Dumanoski, D. and Myers, J.P. Our Stolen Future, 1996, Plume: New York.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large amounts of incompletely metabolized estrogens and [[progestogen]]s from pharmaceutical products are excreted into the sewage systems of large cities, and are sometimes detectable in the environment. [[Sex steroid]]s are sometimes used in cattle farming but have been banned in chicken meat production for 40 years. Although agricultural laws regulate use to minimize accidental human consumption, the rules are largely self-enforced in the United States. Significant exposure of a child to hormones or other substances that activate estrogen or androgen [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s could produce some or all of the changes of puberty.

Harder to detect as an influence on puberty are the more diffusely distributed environmental chemicals like PCBs ([[polychlorinated biphenyl]]), which can bind and trigger estrogen receptors.

More obvious degrees of partial puberty from direct exposure of young children to small but significant amounts of pharmaceutical sex steroids from exposure at home may be detected during medical evaluation for [[precocious puberty]], but mild effects and the other potential exposures outlined above would not.

[[Bisphenol A]] (BPA) is a chemical used to make plastics, and is frequently used to make baby bottles, water bottles, sports equipment, medical devices, and as a coating in food and beverage cans.  Scientists are concerned about BPA's behavioral effects on fetuses, infants, and children at current exposure levels because it can affect the prostate gland, mammary gland, and lead to early puberty in girls. BPA mimics and interferes with the action of estrogen—an important reproduction and development regulator. It [[Leaching (chemical science)|leaches]] out of plastic into liquids and foods, and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found measurable amounts of BPA in the bodies of more than 90 percent of the U.S. population studied.  The highest estimated daily intakes of BPA occur in infants and children. Many plastic baby bottles contain BPA, and BPA is more likely to leach out of plastic when its temperature is increased, as when one warms a baby bottle or warms up food in the microwave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://center4research.org/child-teen-health/early-puberty-and-problems-in-sexual-development/are-bisphenol-a-bpa-plastic-products-safe-for-infants-and-children/ |title=Are Bisphenol A (BPA) Plastic Products Safe for Infants and Children? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nutritional influence====
[[Nutrition]]al factors are the strongest and most obvious environmental factors affecting timing of puberty.&lt;ref name=xia/&gt; Girls are especially sensitive to nutritional regulation because they must contribute all of the nutritional support to a growing fetus. Surplus [[calorie]]s (beyond growth and activity requirements) are reflected in the amount of [[adipose|body fat]], which signals to the brain the availability of resources for initiation of puberty and fertility.

Much evidence suggests that for most of the last few centuries, nutritional differences accounted for majority of variation of pubertal timing in different populations, and even among social classes in the same population. Recent worldwide increased consumption of animal protein, other changes in nutrition, and increases in [[childhood obesity]] have resulted in falling ages of puberty, mainly in those populations with the higher previous ages. In many populations the amount of variation attributable to nutrition is shrinking.

Although available dietary energy (simple calories) is the most important dietary influence on timing of puberty, quality of the diet plays a role as well. Lower [[protein]] intakes and higher [[dietary fiber]] intakes, as occur with typical [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian diet]]s, are associated with later onset and slower progression of female puberty.

====Obesity influence and exercise====
Scientific researchers have linked early [[obesity]] with an earlier onset of puberty in girls.  They have cited obesity as a cause of breast development before nine years and menarche before twelve years.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Phil|last=McKenna|title=Childhood obesity brings early puberty for girls|publisher=''[[New Scientist]]''|date=2007-03-05|accessdate=2010-05-22|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11307-childhood-obesity-brings-early-puberty-for-girls.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080419072722/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11307-childhood-obesity-brings-early-puberty-for-girls.html |archivedate = 2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early puberty in girls can be a harbinger of later health problems.&lt;ref&gt;Molly, M. Ginty, [http://womensenews.org/story/campaign-trail/060522/peru-campaign-quiet-reproductive-issues "US Girls' Early Puberty Attracts Research Flurry"], ''[[Women's eNews]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The average level of daily physical activity has also been shown to affect timing of puberty, especially in females. A high level of exercise, whether for athletic or body image purposes, or for daily subsistence, reduces energy calories available for reproduction and slows puberty. The exercise effect is often amplified by a lower body fat mass and cholesterol.

====Physical and mental illness====
Chronic diseases can delay puberty in both boys and girls. Those that involve chronic inflammation or interfere with nutrition have the strongest effect. In the western world, [[inflammatory bowel disease]] and [[tuberculosis]] have been notorious for such an effect in the last century, while in areas of the underdeveloped world, chronic [[parasite]] [[infection]]s are widespread.

Mental illnesses occur in puberty. The brain undergoes significant development by [[hormone]]s which can contribute to mood disorders such as [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[dysthymia]] and [[schizophrenia]]. Girls aged between 15 and 19 make up 40% of [[anorexia nervosa]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bulik CM, Reba L, Siega-Riz AM, Reichborn-Kjennerud T | title = Anorexia nervosa: definition, epidemiology, and cycle of risk. | journal = The International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 37 Suppl | pages = S2–9; discussion S20–1 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15852310 | doi = 10.1002/eat.20107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stress and social factors====
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
Some of the least understood environmental influences on timing of puberty are social and psychological. In comparison with the effects of genetics, nutrition, and general health, social influences are small, shifting timing by a few months rather than years. Mechanisms of these social effects are unknown, though a variety of physiological processes, including [[pheromone]]s, have been suggested based on animal research.

The most important part of a child's psychosocial environment is the family, and most of the social influence research has investigated features of family structure and function in relation to earlier or later female puberty. Most of the studies have reported that menarche may occur a few months earlier in girls in high-stress households, whose fathers are absent during their early childhood, who have a stepfather in the home, who are subjected to prolonged [[sexual abuse]] in childhood, or who are [[international adoption|adopted]] from a developing country at a young age. Conversely, menarche may be slightly later when a girl grows up in a large family with a biological father present.

More extreme degrees of environmental stress, such as wartime refugee status with threat to physical survival, have been found to be associated with delay of maturation, an effect that may be compounded by dietary inadequacy.

Most of these reported social effects are small and our understanding is incomplete. Most of these "effects" are statistical associations revealed by [[epidemiology|epidemiologic]] surveys. Statistical associations are not necessarily causal, and a variety of covariables and alternative explanations can be imagined. Effects of such small size can never be confirmed or refuted for any individual child. Furthermore, interpretations of the data are politically controversial because of the ease with which this type of research can be used for political advocacy. Accusations of bias based on political agenda sometimes accompany scientific criticism.

Another limitation of the social research is that nearly all of it has concerned girls, partly because female puberty requires greater physiologic resources and partly because it involves a unique event (menarche) that makes survey research into female puberty much simpler than male. More detail is provided in the [[menarche]] article.

===Variations of sequence===
The sequence of events of pubertal development can occasionally vary. For example, in about 15% of boys and girls, [[pubarche]] (the first pubic hairs) can precede, respectively, [[gonadarche]] and [[thelarche]] by a few months. Rarely, [[menarche]] can occur before other signs of puberty in a few girls. These variations deserve medical evaluation because they can occasionally signal a disease.

==Neurohormonal process==
The endocrine [[reproductive]] system consists of the [[hypothalamus]], the [[pituitary gland|pituitary]], the [[gonad]]s, and the [[adrenal gland]]s, with input and regulation from many other body systems. True puberty is often termed "central puberty" because it begins as a process of the [[central nervous system]]. A simple description of hormonal puberty is as follows:

#The brain's [[hypothalamus]] begins to release pulses of [[GnRH]].
#Cells in the [[anterior pituitary]] respond by secreting [[Luteinizing hormone|LH]] and [[Follicle stimulating hormone|FSH]] into the circulation.
#The [[ovary|ovaries]] or [[testes]] respond to the rising amounts of LH and FSH by growing and beginning to produce [[estradiol]] and [[testosterone]].
#Rising levels of estradiol and testosterone produce the body changes of female and male puberty.

The onset of this neurohormonal process may precede the first visible body changes by 1–2 years.

===Components of the endocrine reproductive system===

The '''[[arcuate nucleus]]''' of the '''[[hypothalamus]]''' is the driver of the reproductive system. It has [[neuron]]s which generate and release pulses of GnRH into the portal venous system of the [[pituitary gland]]. The arcuate nucleus is affected and controlled by neuronal input from other areas of the brain and hormonal input from the [[gonad]]s, [[adipose]] tissue and a variety of other systems.

The '''[[pituitary gland]]''' responds to the pulsed GnRH signals by releasing LH and FSH into the blood of the general circulation, also in a pulsatile pattern.

The '''gonads''' ([[testes]] and [[ovary|ovaries]]) respond to rising levels of LH and FSH by producing the [[steroid]] [[sex steroid|sex hormones]], [[testosterone]] and [[estrogen]].

The '''[[adrenal gland]]s''' are a second source for steroid hormones. Adrenal maturation, termed [[adrenarche]], typically precedes gonadarche in mid-childhood.

===Major hormones===

*'''[[Neurokinin B]]''' (a [[tachykinin]] [[peptide]]) and '''[[kisspeptin]]''' (a [[neuropeptide]]), both present in [[KNDy neuron|KNDy neurons]] of the [[hypothalamus]], are critical parts of the control system that switches on the release of GnRH at the start of puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Topaloglu AK, Reimann F, Guclu M, Yalin AS, Kotan LD, Porter KM, Serin A, Mungan NO, Cook JR, Ozbek MN, Imamoglu S, Akalin NS, Yuksel B, O'Rahilly S, Semple RK | title = TAC3 and TACR3 mutations in familial hypogonadotropic hypogonadism reveal a key role for Neurokinin B in the central control of reproduction | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 354–8 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19079066 | doi = 10.1038/ng.306 | laydate = 2008-12-11 | laysummary = http://esciencenews.com/articles/2008/12/11/key.regulation.puberty.discovered | laysource = e! Science News | pmc = 4312696 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[GnRH]]''' ([[gonadotropin]]-releasing hormone) is a [[peptide]] [[hormone]] released from the [[hypothalamus]] which stimulates [[gonadotrope]] cells of the anterior [[pituitary gland|pituitary]].
*'''[[Luteinizing hormone|LH]]''' (luteinizing hormone) is a larger [[protein]] hormone secreted into the general circulation by gonadotrope cells of the anterior [[pituitary gland]]. The main target cells of LH are the [[Leydig cell]]s of [[Testicle|testes]] and the [[theca cell]]s of the [[Ovary|ovaries]]. LH secretion changes more dramatically with the initiation of puberty than FSH, as LH levels increase about 25-fold with the onset of puberty, compared with the 2.5-fold increase of FSH.
*'''[[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]]''' ([[Ovarian follicle|follicle]] stimulating hormone) is another protein hormone secreted into the general circulation by the [[gonadotrope]] cells of the anterior pituitary. The main target cells of FSH are the [[ovarian follicle]]s and the [[Sertoli cell]]s and [[spermatogenesis|spermatogenic]] tissue of the [[Testicle|testes]].
*'''[[Testosterone]]''' is a [[steroid]] hormone produced primarily by the [[Leydig cell]]s of the [[Testicle|testes]], and in lesser amounts by the [[theca cell]]s of the ovaries and the adrenal cortex. Testosterone is the primary mammalian [[androgen]] and the "original" [[anabolic steroid]]. It acts on [[androgen receptor]]s in responsive tissue throughout the body.
*'''[[Estradiol]]''' is a [[steroid]] hormone produced by [[aromatization]] of testosterone. Estradiol is the principal human [[estrogen]] and acts on [[estrogen receptor]]s throughout the body. The largest amounts of estradiol are produced by the [[granulosa cell]]s of the [[Ovary|ovaries]], but lesser amounts are derived from [[Testicle|testicular]] and [[Adrenal gland|adrenal]] testosterone.
*'''[[Adrenal gland|Adrenal]] [[androgen]]s''' are steroids produced by the [[zona reticulosa]] of the [[adrenal cortex]] in both sexes. The major adrenal androgens are [[dehydroepiandrosterone]], [[androstenedione]] (which are precursors of testosterone), and [[dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate]] which is present in large amounts in the [[blood]]. Adrenal androgens contribute to the androgenic events of early puberty in girls.
*'''[[IGF1]]''' ([[insulin-like growth factor 1]]) rises substantially during puberty in response to rising levels of [[growth hormone]] and may be the principal mediator of the [[Adolescence#Growth spurt|pubertal growth spurt]].
*'''[[Leptin]]''' is a protein hormone produced by [[adipose tissue]]. Its primary target organ is the [[hypothalamus]]. The leptin level seems to provide the [[brain]] a rough indicator of adipose mass for purposes of regulation of [[appetite]] and [[energy metabolism]]. It also plays a permissive role in female puberty, which usually will not proceed until an adequate body mass has been achieved.

===Endocrine perspective===
The [[endocrine system|endocrine reproductive system]] becomes functional by the end of the first [[Pregnancy|trimester]] of fetal life. The testes and ovaries become briefly inactive around the time of birth but resume hormonal activity until several months after birth, when incompletely understood mechanisms in the brain begin to suppress the activity of the arcuate nucleus. This has been referred to as maturation of the prepubertal "gonadostat," which becomes sensitive to negative feedback by [[sex steroid]]s. The period of hormonal activity until several months after birth, followed by suppression of activity, may correspond to the period of infant sexuality, followed by a [[latency stage]], which [[Sigmund Freud]] described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lehrer S | title = Modern correlates of Freudian psychology. Infant sexuality and the unconscious. | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 77 | issue = 6 | pages = 977–80 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6507468 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(84)90172-4 | url = http://sites.google.com/site/infantsexuality/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gonadotropin]] and sex steroid levels fall to low levels (nearly undetectable by current [[medical test|clinical assays]]) for approximately another 8 to 10 years of childhood. Evidence is accumulating that the reproductive system is not totally inactive during the childhood years. Subtle increases in gonadotropin pulses occur, and ovarian follicles surrounding [[germ cell]]s (future [[Ovum|egg]]s) double in number.

Normal puberty is initiated in the hypothalamus, with de-inhibition of the pulse generator in the arcuate nucleus. This inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is an ongoing active suppression by other areas of the brain. The signal and mechanism releasing the arcuate nucleus from inhibition have been the subject of investigation for decades and remain incompletely understood. [[Leptin]] levels rise throughout childhood and play a part in allowing the arcuate nucleus to resume operation. If the childhood inhibition of the arcuate nucleus is interrupted prematurely by injury to the brain, it may resume pulsatile gonadotropin release and puberty will begin at an early age.

Neurons of the arcuate nucleus secrete [[gonadotropin releasing hormone]] (GnRH) into the blood of the pituitary portal system. An American physiologist, Ernst Knobil, found that the GnRH signals from the hypothalamus induce pulsed secretion of LH (and to a lesser degree, FSH) at roughly 1-2 hour intervals. The LH pulses are the consequence of pulsatile GnRH secretion by the arcuate nucleus that, in turn, is the result of an [[oscillator]] or signal generator in the central nervous system ("GnRH pulse generator").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Neill JD | title = In Memoriam: Ernst Knobil (1926-2000) | journal = [[Endocrine Reviews]] | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | pages = 721–3 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11739328 | doi = 10.1210/er.22.6.721 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years preceding physical puberty, [[Robert M.

An array of "autoamplification processes" increases the production of all of the pubertal hormones of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.

Regulation of [[adrenarche]] and its relationship to maturation of the hypothalamic-gonadal axis is not fully understood, and some evidence suggests it is a parallel but largely independent process coincident with or even preceding central puberty. Rising levels of adrenal [[androgen]]s (termed adrenarche) can usually be detected between 6 and 11 years of age, even before the increasing gonadotropin pulses of hypothalamic puberty. Adrenal androgens contribute to the development of pubic hair ([[pubarche]]), adult [[body odor]], and other androgenic changes in both sexes. The primary clinical significance of the distinction between adrenarche and gonadarche is that pubic hair and body odor changes by themselves do not prove that central puberty is underway for an individual child.

===Hormonal changes in boys===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
Early stages of male hypothalamic maturation seem to be very similar to the early stages of female puberty, though occurring about 1–2 years later.

LH stimulates the Leydig cells of the testes to make testosterone and blood levels begin to rise. For much of puberty, nighttime levels of testosterone are higher than daytime. Regularity of frequency and amplitude of gonadotropin pulses seems to be less necessary for progression of male than female puberty.

However, a significant portion of [[testosterone]] in adolescent boys is converted to estradiol. Estradiol mediates the growth spurt, bone maturation, and epiphyseal closure in boys just as in girls. Estradiol also induces at least modest development of breast tissue ([[gynecomastia]]) in a large proportion of boys. Boys who develop mild [[gynecomastia]] or even developing [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]]s under [[nipple]]s during puberty are told the effects are temporary in some male teenagers due to high levels of [[estradiol]].

Another hormonal change in males takes place during the teenage years for most young men. At this point in a male's life the testosterone levels slowly rise, and most of the effects are mediated through the androgen receptors by way of conversion [[dihydrotestosterone]] in target organs (especially that of the bowels).

As the amplitude of LH pulses increases, the theca cells of the ovaries begin to produce testosterone and smaller amounts of [[progesterone]]. Much of the testosterone moves into nearby cells called [[granulosa cell]]s. Smaller increases of FSH induce an increase in the [[aromatase]] activity of these granulosa cells, which converts most of the testosterone to estradiol for secretion into the circulation. The remaining testosterone, together with adrenal androgens is responsible for the typical androgenic changes of female puberty: pubic hair, other androgenic hair as outlined above, body odor, acne. The bioactivity of testosterone is to a large degree limited by [[SHBG]] which in turn is mainly controlled by estradiol and [[prolactin]] levels (estradiol stimulates, prolactin decreases SHBG synthesis).

Rising levels of estradiol produce the characteristic estrogenic body changes of female puberty: growth spurt, acceleration of bone maturation and closure, [[breast]] [[Human development (biology)|growth]], increased fat composition, growth of the uterus, increased thickness of the [[endometrium]] and the vaginal mucosa, and widening of the lower pelvis.

As the estradiol levels gradually rise and the other autoamplification processes occur, a point of maturation is reached when the feedback sensitivity of the hypothalamic "gonadostat" becomes positive. This attainment of positive feedback is the hallmark of female sexual maturity, as it allows the mid cycle LH surge necessary for [[ovulation]].

Growth hormone levels rise steadily throughout puberty. [[Insulin-like growth factor 1|IGF1]] levels rise and then decline as puberty ends. Growth finishes and adult height is attained as the estradiol levels complete closure of the [[epiphyses]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18409">A '''reception statute''' is a statutory law adopted as a former British colony becomes independent by which the new nation adopts, or receives, the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] before its independence to the extent not explicitly rejected by the [[legislative body]] or [[constitution]] of the new nation. Reception statutes generally consider the English common law dating prior to independence, as well as the [[precedent]]s originating from it, as the default law because of the importance of using an extensive and predictable body of law to govern the conduct of citizens and businesses in a new state.

All [[US states]] have either implemented reception statutes or adopted the [[common law]] by judicial opinion, but there is [[Reception statute#United States|a special case of partial reception for Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wl3KFBnC0P0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Thinking like a lawyer: an introduction to legal reasoning] (Westview Press, 1996), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial reception of English common law into new colonies and adoption of common law on decolonization==
In ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', Sir [[William Blackstone]] described the process by which [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] followed English colonization:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Plantations or colonies, in distant countries, are either such where the lands are claimed by right of occupancy only, by finding them [[terra nullius|desert and uncultivated]], and peopling them from the mother-country; or where, when already cultivated, they have been either gained by [[conquest (military)|conquest]], or ceded to us by [[treaty|treaties]]. And both these rights are founded upon the law of nature, or at least upon that of nations. But there is a difference between these two species of colonies, with respect to the laws by which they are bound. For it hath been held, that if an uninhabited country be discovered and planted by English subjects, all the English laws then in being, which are the birthright of every subject, are immediately there in force.... But in conquered or ceded countries, that have already laws of their own, the [[List of British monarchs|king]] may indeed alter and change those laws; but, till he does actually change them, the ancient laws of the country remain, unless such as are against the law of God, as in the case of an infidel country.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, if an "uninhabited" or "infidel" territory is colonised by Britain, the English law automatically applies in the territory from the moment of colonisation, but if the colonised territory has a pre-existing legal system, the native law would apply (effectively, a form of [[indirect rule]]) until it is formally superseded by the English law by [[Royal Prerogative]], subjected to the [[Westminster Parliament]].

As colonies gained independence from Britain, the newly-independent countries usually adopted [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] [[precedent]] as of the date of independence as the default law to carry forward into the new nation, to the extent that was not explicitly rejected by the founding documents or government.

In some cases, the carry-forward was simply understood, with no express provision in either the new independence constitution or legislation. In other cases, the new legislature preferred to state redundantly but safely that [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] had been received during the colonial period. Examples of both patterns are described below.

== United States ==
After the 1776 [[American Revolution]], one of the first legislative acts undertaken by each of the newly-independent states was to adopt a "reception statute" that gave legal effect to the existing body of [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|English common law]] to the extent that the legislation or the [[constitution]] had not explicitly rejected English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Michigan High Court Ruling Offers Positive Guidance on Challenges to Tort Reform Laws | last1 = Lammi | first1 = Glenn G. | last2 = Chang | first2 = James | date = December 17, 2004 | journal = Legal Backgrounder | publisher = [[Washington Legal Foundation]] | volume = 19 | issue = 46 | issn=1056-3059|url = http://www.wlf.org/upload/121704LBChang.pdf | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states enacted reception statutes as legislative statutes, but other states received the English common law by provisions of their constitution or by court decision. British traditions such as the [[monarchy]] were rejected by the [[US Constitution]], but many English common law traditions such as [[habeas corpus]], [[jury trials]], and various other [[civil liberties]] were adopted in the United States. Significant elements of English common law prior to 1776 still remain in effect in many jurisdictions in the United States because they have never been rejected by American courts or legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;''Milestones! 200 Years of American Law: Milestones in Our Legal History''. By Jethro Koller Lieberman. Published by West, 1976. Original from the University of California. Digitized Jun 11, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-519881-2}}, p. 16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=i_2wAAAAIAAJ&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the New York Constitution of 1777&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/ny01.htm New York Constitution of 1777] via Avalon Project at [[Yale]] Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; provides that:
{{quote|[S]uch parts of the common law of England, and of the statute law of England and Great Britain, and of the acts of the legislature of the colony of New York, as together did form the law of the said colony on the 19th day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, shall be and continue the law of this State, subject to such alterations and provisions as the legislature of this State shall, from time to time, make concerning the same.}}

[[Alexander Hamilton]] emphasized in the [[Federalist Papers]] that the New York constitutional provision expressly made the common law subject "to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Hamilton, [http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa84.htm Federalist 84] (1788).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even when reception was effected by a constitution, the common law was still subject to alteration by a legislature's statute.

The [[Northwest Ordinance]], which was approved by the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in 1787, guaranteed "judicial proceedings according to the course of the common law." [[Nathan Dane]], the primary author of the Northwest Ordinance, viewed that provision as a default mechanism if federal or territorial statutes were silent about a particular matter. Hr wrote that if "a statute makes an offence, and is silent as to the mode of trial, it shall be by jury, according to the course of the common law."&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Dane, 6 ''General Abridgment and Digest of American Law'' §182, art. 5, 230 (Cummings, Hilliard &amp; Co. 1823).&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the provision operated as a reception statute, giving legal authority to the established common law in the vast territories in which no states had yet been established.

Over time, as new states were formed from federal territories, the territorial reception statutes became obsolete and were re-enacted as state law. For example, a reception statute enacted by legislation in the state of Washington states, "The common law, so far as it is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or of the state of Washington nor incompatible with the institutions and condition of society in this state, shall be the rule of decision in all the courts of this state."&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Legal Foundation v. Legal Foundation of Washington'', [http://laws.lp.findlaw.com/getcase/9th/case/9835154&amp;exact=1 271 F.3d 835] (9th Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; In that way, the common law was eventually incorporated into the legal systems of every state (except for the [[law of Louisiana]] for which some areas of law were received as [[common law]] and others were adopted from French and Spanish sources).

Certain anomalies exist within certain US states because of the effective branching of the law in different directions. For example, the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] adopted the [[English common law]] upon becoming independent but before [[England]] abolished [[trial by combat]]. Thus, it has been argued that the right to request trial by combat theoretically still exists in Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/trial-by-combat-in-the-united-states-2013-11&lt;/ref&gt; at least as far as a [[form of action]] under which the common law had authorized trial by combat would be available in Virginia.

==Canada==
The Canadian colonies received the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] and English statutes under Blackstone's principles for the establishment of the legal system of a new colony. In five of the ten Canadian provinces, English law was received automatically, under the principle of a settled colony inheriting English law. In the other provinces and in the three territories, reception was governed by reception statutes. The reception of English law occurred long before Canada became fully independent and so reception statutes in Canada were not part of the decolonisation process.

When Canada achieved formal independence with the passage of the [[Canada Act 1982]], no reception statutes were necessary for the decolonialisation process.  English law had already been received in all the various Canadian provinces and territories by legislation and judicial decisions over the previous two centuries.

=== Atlantic provinces ===
In the four Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador), the reception of English law was automatic, under the principle set out by Blackstone relating to settled colonies. British colonists were considered to have brought English common law and the applicable English statutes with them and so no reception statute was necessary.

The reception date for New Brunswick is 1660, for Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island 1758, and for Newfoundland and Labrador 1825.

=== Quebec ===
Quebec was settled as a French colony and originally operated under the French civil law system by using the ''Coûtume de Paris''. Upon the transfer of the colony to British control, the British government issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], which imposed English common law on the colony under the principle set out in Blackstone relating to captured colonies. However, in 1774, the British Parliament passed the [[Quebec Act]], which restored the French civil law for matters of private law (matters such as contracts, property, and successions (wills)) but kept the English common law as the basis for public law in the colony, notably the criminal law.

With the passage of the [[Civil Code of Lower Canada]] in 1866, Quebec's civil law became entirely statute-based and used the civil law system for matters within provincial jurisdiction.

Public law in Quebec continues to have its origin in the common law, but even then, civil law plays a strong role. If federal legislation requires interpretation, judges must look to the Civil Code of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Quebec North Shore Paper Co. v. Canadian Pacific (1976), [1977] 2 S.C.R 1054; St-Hilaire v. Canada (Attorney General), 2001 FCA 63, [2001] 4 FC 289&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ontario ===
The territory now forming Ontario was originally part of Quebec and so was under the civil law. When Quebec was divided into the two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada by the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]], the first Act passed by the Legislature of Upper Canada was to adopt the law of England for all purposes, replacing the civil law.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to repeal certain parts of an Act passed in the Fourteenth Year of His Majesty's Reign, intituled an Act for making more effectual Provision for the Government of the Province of Quebec in North America;  and to introduce the English Law, as the Rule of Decision in all matters of controversy relative to Property and Civil Rights'', S.U.C. 1792 (32 Geo. III), c. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; That statute adopted both the English common law and English statute law. The foundation for the operation of the common law in Ontario traces back to that reception statute.

=== North-West Territories, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta ===
The new Dominion of Canada acquired the territories of  [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1870. Those territories were considered to have been settled by British colonists and so the reception of English law was automatic. However, the long history of control by the Hudson's Bay Company caused some uncertainty as to the date of reception. To resolve the uncertainty, various statutes were passed to set the date of reception to July 15, 1870, the date of the transfer of those two territories to Canada. The Province of Manitoba set that date for the reception of English law for matters coming within provincial jurisdiction. The Legislature of the North-West Territories passed an ordinance, adopting the same date for matters coming within territorial jurisdiction.

The federal Parliament eventually enacted a provision adopting that date for all matters in the North-West Territories.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/statutes/historical/NWT.pdf The North-West Territories Act]'', R.S.C.1885, c. 50, s. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; That provision was carried forward in the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan when they were created by the [[Alberta Act]]&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/aa_1905.html Alberta Act]'', S.C. 1905, c. 3, s. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Saskatchewan Act]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/english/statutes/historical/SK%20Act.pdf Saskatchewan Act]'', S.C. 1905, c. 42, s. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same provision is the basis for the reception date of English law in the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut.

=== British Columbia ===
British Columbia was considered to be a settled colony and so received English law automatically, under the principle set out by Blackstone.

==Hong Kong==

Hong Kong was ceded (in case of the [[New Territories]], leased) to the United Kingdom by [[Qing dynasty]] of China by a series of treaties, starting with the [[Treaty of Nanking]] in 1842. As a ceded or leased territory with its own set of laws, the [[Great Qing Legal Code]] remained in force for the local Chinese population. Until the late 19th century, a Chinese man convicted of [[murder]] would be executed by [[decapitation]], but an Englishman convicted of the same crime would be sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. It was not until 1971, nearly six decades after the fall of the Qing dynasty, that the of the Qing Code was completely abolished in Hong Kong. Even then, some vestiges of it remain. For example, before the Marriage Reform Ordinance 1970 (Cap. 178) came into force on 7 October 1971, a man could practice [[polygamy]] by virtue of the Qing Code. The courts still refer to the Qing Code on the inheritance rights of surviving [[concubinage|concubines]] married before 1971 and that of their children.

When Hong Kong was handed over to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1997, Hong Kong retained the [[Common law#1. Common law as opposed to statutory law and regulatory law|common law]] in a reception statute in Chapter I, Article 8, of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/chapter_1.html |title=Chapter I, Section 8 of Hong Kong Basic Law |publisher=Basiclaw.gov.hk |date=2008-03-17 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The laws previously in force in Hong Kong, that is, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and customary law shall be maintained, except for any that contravene this Law, and subject to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.}}

==Republic of Ireland==

The 1922 [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]] stated that pre-existing laws would remain in force except if repugnant to it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1922/act/1/schedule/1/enacted/en/html|title=Constitution of the Irish Free State|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 73 |nopp=Y|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]] does likewise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article50_1|title=Constitution of Ireland|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Article 50.1 |nopp=Y|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither explicitly stated whether that meant only the statute law or, more broadly, the common law and [[equity (law)|equity]] as well. The [[Supreme Court (Ireland)|Supreme Court]] has generally taken the broader view.&lt;ref name="Keane2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keane|first=Ronan|title=Equity and the Law of Trusts in the Republic of Ireland|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lFMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=16 July 2016|year=2011|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781847667021|pages=22–23, sec.2.39|chapter=The Historical Background}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other British colonies==
The pattern was repeated in many other former British colonies as they gained independence from the United Kingdom. [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Belize]] and various Caribbean and African nations have adopted English common law by reception statutes although they do not inevitably continue to copy English common law; later cases can often draw on decisions in other common law jurisdictions. The colony of [[New South Wales]] formally received the English common law in 1828, and each of the other Australian colonies received the common law of New South Wales upon its founding.

'''Reto Müller''' (born February 1964, [[Basel]]) is a [[Swiss]] [[musicologist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gorossini.info/reto-m%C3%BCller/|title=Dienstleistungen rund um Giaochino Rossini - Über Reto Müller |accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on [[Gioachino Rossini]].

Müller has been studying Rossini's work since 1979 (full-time since 2010). Since 1991 he has been providing advisory and organizational services to the [[bel canto]] Opera festival ''[[Rossini in Wildbad]]''. Since 1992 he has also been active in the Fondazione Rossini (Pesaro / Italy), including the publications ''Bollettino del Centro rossiniano di studi'' and ''Lettere e Documenti''.

Retrieved 10 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; known as "Madame Documentation,"&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. "Suzanne Briet, 1894-1989: 'Madame Documentation'." http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/briet.html. Retrieved 10 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; was a librarian, author, historian, poet, and visionary best known for her treatise ''Qu'est-ce que la documentation?'' (''What is Documentation?''), a foundational text in the modern study of [[information science]]. She is also known for her writings on the history of [[Ardennes]] and the poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R. E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her treatise ''Qu'est-ce que la documentation?'' offers a vision of documentation that moves beyond [[Paul Otlet]]'s emphasis on fixed forms of documents, such as the book, toward "an unlimited horizon of physical forms and aesthetic formats for documents and an unlimited horizon of techniques and technologies (and of 'documentary agencies' employing these) in the service of multitudes of particular cultures."&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "Preface." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many early [[Information science#European documentation|European Documentalists]], Briet embraced [[modernism|modernity]] and [[science]].&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; However, her work made a difference to modernism and science through the influence of [[French people|French]] [[post-structuralist]] theorists and her strong orientation toward humanistic scholarship. She subsequently ushered in a second generation of European Documentation and introduced humanistic methods and concerns, especially [[semiotics]] and [[cultural studies]], to [[information science]].&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in ''What Is Documentation?''." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Briet had been highly regarded throughout much of her career—the Grand Cross of the [[Légion d'honneur]] was conferred on her in 1950 — she was largely forgotten in her later life, until her death in 1989, when scholars found a renewed interest in her ideas. Today scholars often credit Briet as a visionary, having laid the foundation for contemporary frameworks and methodologies in information science roughly 50 years earlier. "Her modernist perspective," writes [[Michael Buckland]], "combined with semiotics, deserves attention now because it is different from, and offers an alternative to, the scientific, [[Positivism|positivist]] view that has so dominated information science and which is increasingly questioned."&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R. E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Suzanne Briet was born in [[Paris]], [[France]] on 1 February 1894, coming of age at a time of great social change and economic loss in France after [[World War I]]. Although Briet grew up in [[Paris]], she remained attached to her birthplace and ancestral home. Briet was only 20 at the outbreak of the war. Ardennes was the pathway of German armies invading France, and during the hostilities her uncle was deported, his village was invaded, and her grandfather's house was destroyed. Historians have suggested that perhaps because of her experiences during the war, as well as her travels to [[England]] as a child, Briet took an early interest in the [[League of Nations]], sitting in on some of the sessions held in Paris, and the founding of other international organizations.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; Briet's mother expected her to become a teacher. Briet's family sent her to Ecole de Sèvres, an elite women's school for training secondary school teachers, where she earned a degree in history and qualified to teach English and history. After teaching in Algeria from 1917 to 1920, Briet pursued a career in librarianship.&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 1"&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; She studied with Louis Barrau-Dihigo at the [[Sorbonne]], who was apparently so taken with Briet's talents that "when Briet explained that she could only participate on Saturday, he changed the time of the course to accommodate her."&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; At age 30 in 1924, Briet was one of the first of three women appointed as professional librarians at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]].&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 1"/&gt;

==Career==
Briet's career at the Bibliothèque  Nationale witnessed major changes in the library profession. Briet played a central role in the "modern library" movement, which eschewed elitist traditions that had dominated many libraries in favor of "modern" ideas of librarianship. In addition to technological innovations, Briet saw the emergence of documentation as a distinct profession with its own techniques, standards and training.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; Women also entered the professional classes in France in increasing numbers during [[World War II]], growing from only 10% of the library profession in 1927 to 50% by the end of the war.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; Her main achievements during these years were symbolic of her interest in service and moderninzation. Between 1934 and 1954, Briet created and supervised the Salle des Catalogues et Bibliographies, making available materials throughout France that had been previously restricted to most patrons. By 1931 she co-founded (with chemist [[Jean Gérard]]) the Union Française des Organismes de Documentation, the French analogue of the American Documentation Institution, today known as the [[American Society for Information Science and Technology]].

During [[World War II]], Briet witnessed many of her colleagues deported during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of Paris]] and others arrested as communists. Despite a climate of fear, censorship, oppression and physical hardship, Briet made sure to carry out the catalog and bibliographic services of the Bibliothèque  Nationale. During the war, Briet continued her interest in Documentation, even attending a conference in [[Salzburg]], [[Germany]], which was organized by German Documentalists.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt; At the end of the war, Briet took on a larger role in a growing international documentation movement. In 1950, she prepared an international survey of education for librarians and documentalists commissioned by [[UNESCO]] and was awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]]. In 1951 Briet helped establish the Institut National de Techniques de la Documentation at the [[Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers]]. She was the founding Director of Studies and eventually the Vice-President of the [[International Federation for Documentation]].

That same year, Briet published her treatise ''Qu'est-ce que la documentation?'', in which she outlines, in 48 pages, her philosophy of documentation, "pushing boundaries of the field beyond texts to include any material form of evidence. ('Is a living animal a document?' she asked.)"&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 2"&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Her thirty-year career at the Bibliothèque  Nationale often put Briet in close contact with major French thinkers of the day, including scientists, historians, linguists, and philosophers, which had a significant impact on her philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "Preface." In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  Briet retired from the Bibliothèque  Nationale in 1954 at age 60. She wrote her last essays on documentation in 1955.&lt;ref name="people.ischool.berkeley.edu"&gt;Buckland, Michael. "Checklist of Writings" http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~buckland/Brietwebbib.pdf Retrieved 10 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She spent her retirement concentrating on other interests, including the history of [[Ardennes]] and the poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]]. Her memoirs were published in 1979.&lt;ref name="Buckland, Michael 2006 p. 2"/&gt; She died in [[Boulogne]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="gseis.ucla.edu"/&gt;

==Impact on information science==
Briet published roughly 100 essays, books, and reports on documentation, [[library science]], and [[history]]&lt;ref name="people.ischool.berkeley.edu"/&gt; She took up many of the pressing issues of documentation in her day: [[internationalization]], [[institutionalization]], [[information overload|information or documentary overload]], [[scholarly communication]], [[science and technology studies]], [[world peace]], and [[international development]]. Briet had been deeply engaged in the documentation movement from the 1920s onward, bringing to it a deep understanding of culture and the humanities. Expanding on the techniques and technological ideas of earlier European Documentalists, such as [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Henri La Fontaine]], "Briet understood that technology and culture were deeply connected. She saw society and, therefore, culture, as being re-shaped by technology. The techniques of documentation in aiding and shaping intellectual work were, in her view, both a symptom of, and contributing force within the 'industrialization' of knowledge workers. We can now see, in the impact of computers and telecommunications, how right she was."&lt;ref&gt;Buckland, Michael. (2006). "A Brief Biography of Suzanne Renée Briet." In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As one scholar notes, "Not again -- until [[Actor-network theory]] at the end of the twentieth century -- would a social network account of technical production, and specifically, documentary production, be articulated."&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in What Is Documentation?." In What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Briet's body of work points to the necessity to understand cultural categories, historical lineages, and the social forces that create and sustain information, urging scholars and information professionals to explore beyond the boundaries of their cultural specialization. Paul Otlet problematized the definition of document when he opened the possibility of any object, independent of the human intention behind its creation, to be a considered a document. Briet solves this problem with her argument that a document must be defined by its intentional use as such. She gives the example of an antelope -- running wild in the plains, it is not a document, but captured and placed in a zoo, it becomes an object of study and thus a document. It operates, as Briet says it must, as “evidence in support of a fact”.&lt;ref&gt;"What is a 'document'?" Journal of the American Society for Information Science 48, no. 9 (Sept 1997): 804-809.&lt;/ref&gt; An object’s treatment as evidence is contingent not only on its own properties but on its very framing as a source of information. It must be organized into a meaningful relationship with other evidence in order to have the indexical power of evidence.

According to one scholar, "One of Briet's most important insights was that individual documents may be interpreted in different ways by different people wishing to put them to different uses for different purposes. This variability of interpretation is characteristic of documents even at the level of individual words, and the different decisions made by different translators at the word level can have significant consequences."&lt;ref&gt;Furner, Jonathan. (2008). "Review: What Is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text. By Suzanne Briet. Translated and edited by Ronald E. Day and Laurent Martinet with Hermina G. B. Anghelescu." Libraries &amp; the Cultural Record 43.1, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Briet developed the notion of ''indice'' (literally "index") as not only pointing to an object but also reflective of the networks in which that object appears as a named thing, leading to a semiotics-inspired definition of "document." Furthermore, Briet argued that techniques and technologies are expressions of a networked culture. One scholar explains the idea this way: "Information and communication technologies may introduce a 'new rhythm' to society and culture, but they themselves are a "symptom" of Western social development."&lt;ref name="Day, Ronald 2006 p. 55"&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in What Is Documentation?." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, technique and technology are historically specific and symptomatic of culture. Briet argues that documentation must respond by incorporating these symptoms and specificities of Western culture but also must incorporate "Western modernity's opposite trend toward global expansion."&lt;ref name="Day, Ronald 2006 p. 55"/&gt; Briet also saw knowledge as embedded and emergent in cultural and social production and saw modernity as the growth of networks of knowledge. Indeed, in an increasingly globalized world, Briet argued for documentation to take up the call of material necessity rather than be put into the service of culture or any one culture; that is, "documentation marks the importance of particular, more 'localized' or specialized cultures in terms of their material needs, their specialized vocabularies, and the techniques and technologies needed to provide documentary services to these groups."&lt;ref&gt;Day, Ronald. (2006). "'A Necessity of Our Time': Documentation as 'Cultural Technique in What Is Documentation?." In ''What is Documentation?: English Translation of the Classic French Text.'' R. E. Day, L. Martinet &amp; H. G. B. Anghelescu, Trans.; ed., R.E. Day and L. Martinet. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Symbolic communication''' is exchange of messages that change ''a priori'' expectation of events. Examples of this are modern [[communication]] technology and the exchange of information amongst animals. 
By referring to objects and ideas not present at the time of communication, a world of possibility is opened. In humans, this process has been compounded to result in our current state of modernity.

==Animal Societies==
{{See also|Animal communication|Bee learning and communication}}
In animal societies, symbolic communication helps one understand the conduct of members of cooperating groups. The behavior of [[weaver ant]] workers has been carefully studied and it has been found that communicative gestures with respect to members of the same [[colony]] are different from those used with intruders. The interpretation of the symbolic dance of [[honey bee]]s as a communicative language has been questioned by a few, though numerous experimental results over the last several decades have effectively laid this controversy to rest.

==Human Societies==
An example of symbolic communication in  humans is the wearing of uniforms.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} A man in a white coat with a stethoscope will often be perceived as a doctor on the basis of his appearance alone. Military uniforms have badges and insignias which indicate rank and honours as well as their branch of operation. Humans are the only species who use a symbolic language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gärdenfors|first=Peter|year=2004|title=13Cooperation and the Evolution of Symbolic Communication|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30820582/2004_MIT_EvolutionOfCommunication.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1480437082&amp;Signature=5%2FcPLjb2v%2FdlbFteER5AT5UDFX4%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DSocial_and_cultural_learning_in_the_evol.pdf#page=248|journal=Evolution of Communication Systems|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theoretical oxygen demand''' ('''ThOD''') is the calculated amount of [[oxygen]] required to [[oxidize]] a compound to its final [[oxidation]] products.&lt;ref name="Penn"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Environmental and Ecological Chemistry |volume=II |title=Biochemical Oxygen Demand |first=Michael R. |last=Penn |author2=James J. Pauer |author3=James R. Mihelcic |editor=Aleksandar Sabljic |year=2009 |publisher=EOLSS}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are  some differences between standard methods that can influence the results obtained: for example, some calculations assume that [[nitrogen]] released from [[organic compound]]s is generated as [[ammonia]], whereas others allow for ammonia [[oxidation]] to [[nitrate]]. Therefore, in expressing results, the calculation assumptions should always be stated.

In order to determine the  '''ThOD''' for [[glycine]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)COOH) using the following assumptions:

#In the first step, the [[organic carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] are  converted to [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[ammonia]]  (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), respectively.
#In the second and third steps, the ammonia is  oxidized sequentially to [[nitrite]] and [[nitrate]]. 
#The ThOD is the sum of the [[oxygen]] required for all three steps.

We can calculate by following steps:
#Write balanced reaction for the [[Carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand|carbonaceous oxygen demand]].&lt;br&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)COOH + 1.5O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
#Write balanced reactions for the nitrogenous oxygen demand.&lt;br&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 1.5O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;br&gt; HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.5O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
#Determine the ThOD.&lt;br&gt;ThOD = (1.5 + 2) mol O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/mol glycine&lt;br&gt;= 3.5&amp;nbsp;mol O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/mol glycine × 32 g/mol O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / 75 g/mol glycine&lt;br&gt;= 1.49 g O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/g glycine

The theoretical oxygen demand represents the worst-case scenario. The actual oxygen demand of any [[chemical compound|compound]] depends on the [[biodegradability]] of the compound and the specific organism [[metabolizing]] the compound. The actual [[oxygen]] demand can be measured experimentally and is called the [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD).

{{Italic title}}
'''''Thought-Forms: A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation''''' is a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] book compiled by the members of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]] [[Annie Besant|A. Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]]. It was originally published in 1901 in London.{{sfn|Melton|2001b|p=1566}}{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=248}} From the standpoint of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], it tells regarding visualization of thoughts, experiences, emotions and music. Drawings of the "thought-forms" were performed by painters Varley, Prince, and McFarlane.{{sfnm|Gettings|1978|1p=136|Tillett|1986|2p=224}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Vladimir Trefilov|Trefilov]], Theosophy, unlike an academic science, "views the whole world as a manifestation of thought in all categories of matter. [[Occultism|Occult science]] know about the existence of higher types of rarefied matter. Man is in no way limited by the physical world alone."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}} [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] wrote, "There are [[Plane (esotericism)|other worlds]] than that which our senses reveal to us, [[clairvoyance|other senses]] than those which we share with the lower animals, other forces than those of material nature."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|2008|p=373}} Thus, it is necessary to develop the "new senses" in order to "perceive thought-forms."{{sfn|Ellwood|1986|p=117}} Academic science explains the visualization of sensations of a mentally healthy person by a phenomenon of the [[synesthesia]].{{sfn|Britannica}}}}

== From history of compilation ==
This book has become the result of the joint work of the authors, which began in 1895, when they had started an investigation of "the subtle matter of the universe."{{sfn|Wessinger}} They were interested the work of the human mind as, according their claim, this work "extrudes into the external world" the thought-forms.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}

In September 1896, Besant reported in [[Lucifer (magazine)|''Lucifer'']] that "two clairvoyant Theosophists" (whose personalities were not disclosed in the journal, although some members of the Society knew about them) had started "observing the substance of thought." Her article named ''Thought-Forms''{{refn|group=note|Leadbeater does not appear here as a co-author of Besant, nevertheless, according to [[Olav Hammer|Hammer]], after [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky's]] death, it was he who became the main ideologist of the "second generation" of the Theosophists.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=509}}}} was accompanied by four pages of pictures of diverse thought-forms which the investigators "had observed and described to an artist."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}{{refn|group=note|A tradition of "seeing thoughts" already existed in [[spiritualism]]. Dr. Baraduc, a famous French psychiatrist, had informed the "Acadamie de Medecine" in 1896 that he had succeeded to photograph thoughts.{{sfn|Melton|2001b|p=1565}}{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=990}}}} The colour sketches of the unknown performance were depicting: on the first plate—thought-forms of "devotion," "sacrifice," and "devotional," on the second one—three types of "anger," on the third one—three types of "love" ("undirected," "directed," and "grasping"), and on the fourth one—thought-forms of "jealousy," "intellect," and "ambition."{{sfn|Index}} Besant gave the article scientific coloring, not forgetting to mention [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]], Baraduc,{{sfn|Melton|2001a}} [[Carl Reichenbach|Reichenbach]], "vibrations and the ether."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}

This "small but influential book",{{refn|group=note|According to the scholars of religious studies, the authors of the ''Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America.''{{sfn|Keller|2006}}}} which contains color pictures of thought-forms that the authors said are created "in subtle spirit-matter," was published in 1901. The book affirms that "the quality" of thoughts influences the life experience of their creator, and that they "can affect" other people.{{sfn|Keller|2006|p=755}}{{refn|group=note|As Leadbeater noted, "books are specially strong centres of thought-forms, and their unnoticed influence in a man's life is often a powerful one."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 15}}}}

== Basic concepts ==
=== Meaning of color ===
[[File:Colorchart.jpg|thumb|left|160px|&lt;center&gt;Frontispiece. The meanings of colours.&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors write that they, like many theosophists, are convinced that "thoughts are things," and the task of their book is to help the reader understand this.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=16}}{{refn|group=note|[[Gary Lachman|Lachman]] noted that it is "the central maxim of ''Thought-Forms.''"{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}} The frontispiece of the book contains a table "The meanings of colours" of thought-forms and [[Aura (paranormal)|human aura]] associated with feelings and emotions, beginning with "High Spirituality" (light blue—in the upper left corner) and ending by "Malice" (black—in the lower right corner), 25 colors in all.{{refn|group=note|See the frontispiece of ''Thought-Forms,'' 1901. For comparison, see table "Auric Colors and Their Meanings"{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=64–66}} and Ch. "Colours."{{sfn|Powell|1927|loc=Ch. 3}}}}{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}{{sfn|Писарева|2010|p=29}}{{refn|group=note|"Every thought form bears the same color that it would possess if it had been retained in the body of the aura itself."{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=34}}}} The authors argue that human aura is "the outer part of the cloud-like substance of his higher bodies, interpenetrating each other, and extending beyond the confines of his physical body."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=55}} The [[Mental body|mental]] and [[Astral body|desire]] bodies (two human higher bodies) are "those chiefly concerned with the appearance of what are called thought-forms."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=17|Johnston|2012|2p=158}}{{refn|group=note|[[Robert Ellwood|Ellwood]] wrote that, according to theosophy, "auras may be made up of a complex combination of etheric, astral, and mental matter which the clairvoyant is able to perceive, although the most significant ones originate on the border of the mental and astral planes, where the activity of the former is reflected in the configurations of astral matter. When comparable patterns appear as a 'cloud' above or near a person, they may be called 'thought-forms' and as such have been reported in theosophical literature."{{sfn|Ellwood|1986|p=115}}}}{{refn|group=note|Thought-forms are created from the same matter from which the aura is formed, and have the same general properties, in particular, color. Knowledge of the properties of an aura of man is necessary for a proper "understanding of the nature of the thought-forms."{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=31}} According to Powell, the term "thought-forms" is "not wholly accurate," because in the overwhelming majority of cases they are being formed by both astral and mental bodies. It would be more correct to call them ''thought-emotion forms.''{{sfn|Powell|1927|pp=43, 55}} Gettings wrote that in studying the illustrations from this book "one cannot help observing that they do not really relate to thought so much as to feeling – they are really emotion forms rather than thought forms."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Tillett, "Whether or not there is scientific validity in claims about the aura, it remains significant that Leadbeater's descriptions (given initially in an article [''The Aura''] in ''[[The Theosophist]]'' in [December] 1895{{sfn|IndexT}}) have been more or less repeated by later researchers, both scientific and occult. The earliest scientific study of the aura [''The Human Atmosphere,'' 1911] was published by [[Walter John Kilner]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=953}}}}

=== Three principles and three classes ===
The book states that "the production of all thought-forms" is based on three major principles:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Quality of thought determines colour.
# Nature of thought determines form.
# Definiteness of thought determines clearness of outline.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=31|Писарева|2010|2p=29|Jones|2012|3p=54}}{{refn|group=note|[[Alice Bailey|Bailey]] has contraposed the "clear and well-defined, pulsating with the spirit of service" thought-forms of the initiated occultist with the "disjointed, unconnected, and uncorrelated" thought-forms created by the "mass of men."{{sfn|Bailey|2012|p=87}} As Powell wrote, many people go through life, literally tightly locked in their own cells, which they themselves have built, "surrounded by masses of forms created by their habitual thoughts."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=47}} Leadbeater noted later that most people can not free themselves from the influence "of the great crowd of thought-forms which constitute [preconceived] public opinion; and because of those they never really see the truth at all."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 10}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Thought-forms, or 'an artificial [[elemental]]s,' have a huge impact on the earthly life of people, performing certain functions depending on the desires and direction of the thought that created them."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=237}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors define the following three classes of thought-forms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# That which takes the image of the thinker. When a man thinks of himself as in some distant place, or wishes earnestly to be in that place, he makes a thought-form in his own image which appears there.
# That which takes the image of some material object. [The painter who forms a conception of his future picture builds it up out of the matter of his mental body, and then projects it into space in front of him, keeps it before his mind's eye, and copies it. The novelist in the same way builds images of his character in mental matter, and by the exercise of his will moves these puppets from one position or grouping to another, so that the plot of his story is literally acted out before him.]{{refn|group=note|A comparison of the thought-forms of literary heroes with marionettes, Leadbeater repeated in 1913 in his next Theosophical book.{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 6}}}}
# That which takes a form entirely its own,{{refn|group=note|Pisareva wrote that the thought-forms belonged to this category may be named the "symbolic forms."{{sfn|Писарева|2010|p=27}}}} expressing its inherent qualities in the matter which it draws round it. [Those of which we here give specimens are almost wholly of that class.]{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=36|Писарева|2010|2p=26}}{{sfn|Harris}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Examples of thought-forms ==
[[File:Form16.jpg|thumb|left|160px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 16. Self-Renunciation.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=44}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "a pale blue lotus."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}} Blue color expresses "spirituality."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=66}} "A thought of definite, well-sustained devotion may assume a form closely resembling a flower."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=57}} The more purified desires and thoughts of man, the more "radiant and beautiful" are his thought-forms which he create.{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
"To paint in earth's dull colours the forms clothed in the living light of other worlds, — Besant writes in the foreword, — is a hard and thankless task." The authors claim that the images in the book "are not imaginary forms, prepared as some dreamer thinks that they ought to appear." Rather, "they
are representations of forms actually observed as thrown off by ordinary men and women." And the authors sincerely hope that they will force the reader "realise the nature and power of his thoughts, acting as a stimulus to the noble, a curb on the base."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1pp=6, 39|Breen|2014|2p=110}}

=== Created by emotions ===
[[File:Form13.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 13. Grasping Animal Affection.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=43}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "brown-red swirls."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} "Thoughts of a greedy, lustful, or malicious character appear differently from those of a noble, selfless, loving nature."{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Thoughts in which selfishness or greed are prominent usually take a hooked form, the hooks in some case actually clawing round the object desired."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=56}} Leadbeater has compared similar thought-forms with the "[[grappling hook]]s."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 8}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
In Fig. 13 shows the thought-form created by "a strong craving for personal possession." Its color has dull unpleasing hue "deadened with the heavy tint indicative of selfishness." The curving hooks are its especially characteristic. Creator this thought-form had never "conception of the self-sacrificing love which pours itself out in joyous service," no thinking of return.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=44}}{{refn|group=note|Tillett saw here only the "brown-red swirls."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} An especially powerful class of this kind of thought-forms takes on "the appearance of a nebulous octopus, with long, winding, clinging tentacles, striving to wrap around the other person," and to drag him toward the aura of creator.{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=33}}}}{{refn|group=note|"A gross sensual love will be a dull and heavy crimson"... The mutual influence of thoughts is like "adding fuel to the fire." If someone for a long time is fraught with low thoughts, then into his mind will pour such a vicious stream that he will be horrified if he understands what he is doing with himself.{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=65, 84}} According to Leadbeater, do not need to collect photos of actresses [and actors], as "they always attract the most undesirable thought-forms from hosts of impure-minded people."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 15}}}}
[[File:Form19.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 19. The Intention to Know.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=51|Gettings|1987|2p=48|Breen|2014|3p=112}}{{refn|group=note|"I asked him when he saw this curious shape."{{sfn|Jinarajadasa|2003}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors write that a form in Fig. 19 at the top is a specific thought-form which had accompanied a question demonstrating deep thought and penetration. The first variant of the answer did not fully satisfy the questioner, and his desire to achieve a full and comprehensive answer was expressed in the fact that his "thought-form deepened in colour and changed into the second of the two shapes (in Fig. 19 below), resembling a corkscrew even more closely than before."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=51}}{{refn|group=note|[[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa|Jinarajadasa]] informed that on his question to Leadbeater "when he saw this curious shape" he answered that it is a creation of Mr. [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett]], "who tried to 'worm' things out of him, when he appeared to be holding back some knowledge which Mr. Sinnett wanted."{{sfn|Jinarajadasa|2003}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Orange, of a bright shade, represents pride and ambition. Yellow, in its various shades, represents intellectual power."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=65}} Gold colour "indicates pure intellect applied to philosophy or mathematics."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=12}}}}
[[File:Forms22-23.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 22, 23. Murderous Rage and Sustained Anger.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "a bright red spike."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|pp=224–225}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
Fig. 22 and 23 are thought-forms of a "murderous rage" (on the right) and a "sustained anger" (on the left). The first form was taken "from the aura of a rough and partially intoxicated man in the [[East End]] of London," when he was knocking down a woman; a flare flashed in her direction, triggering an explosion of horror—she recognized that one would be struck. In the same illustration drawned a "stiletto-like dart" directed to the lower left corner: it is a thought "of steady anger, intense and desiring vengeance, of the quality of murder, sustained through years, and directed against a person who had inflicted a deep injury on the one who sent it forth."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|Tillett has seen on the left "a bright red spike."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} Sustained anger takes the form of "a sharp, red stiletto."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=58}} The thought-form of anger has a color of black and red, with characteristic flares.{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=34}}}}{{refn|group=note|Red color seen in the form of bright red flares like the lightning flash shows anger. These are "usually shown on a black background in the case of anger arising from hatred or malice."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=64–65}}}}
[[File:Sudden Fright.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 27. Sudden Fright.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=55}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "a cloud of red-grey crescents."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}} "''Sudden Fright'' appears as a series of grey and red crescent shapes bursting out of the aura."{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Greed for alcohol - Annie Besant Thought Form - Project Gutenberg eText 16269.PNG|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 29. Greed for Drink.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=56}}{{refn|group=note|"The craving for alcohol produced undesirable brown-red hooks."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}}}}{{refn|group=note|"The thought of the desire for drink could not enter the body of a purely temperate man. It would strike upon his astral body, but it could not penetrate and it would then return to the sender."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=49}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors state that when a person is suddenly frightened, then has a place the effect shown in Fig. 27. It is emphasized that "all the crescents" on the right, which apparently have been emitted earlier than others, do not show anything other than "the livid grey of fear; but a moment later the man is already partially recovering from the shock, and beginning to feel angry that he allowed himself to be startled." The later crescents have changed to scarlet, and it evidences the "mingling of anger and fear," while the last crescent is quite scarlet, and it shows that "already the fright is entirely overcome, and only the annoyance remains."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=55}}{{refn|group=note|According to Tillett, here you can see "a cloud of red-grey crescents."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}} Gray color of a specific shade, "almost that of a corpse", demonstrates "fear and terror." Red color shows anger.{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=64}}}}

=== Created by experiences ===
Beginning from Fig. 30, "the book changes course in an interesting way," moving from the illustrations of individual thoughts and emotions to the narrative of events.{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=111–112}} Besant and Leadbeater write that occasioned by a "terrible accident" at sea, three thought-forms depicted in Fig. 30 "were seen simultaneously, arranged exactly as represented, though in the midst of indescribable confusion." The authors continue:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"They are instructive as showing how differently people are affected by sudden and serious danger. One form [on the right] shows nothing but an eruption of the livid grey of fear, rising out of a basis of utter selfishness: and unfortunately there were many such as this. The shattered appearance of the thought-form shows the violence and completeness of the explosion, which in turn indicates that the whole soul of that person was possessed with blind, frantic terror, and that the overpowering sense of personal danger excluded for the time every higher feeling."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=57|Breen|2014|2p=112}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Form30.jpg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 30. At a Shipwreck.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=58|Breen|2014|2p=112}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "a grey-brown cloud [on the right]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Lachman, the illustrations of thought-forms in the book are "very reminiscent of much [[Abstract art|abstract]] and [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] painting."{{sfn|Lachman|2008}} "This ushers in the visual heart of the book, featuring images that wouldn't look out of place hanging alongside early [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]] or [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] abstractions."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=112}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors explain that the thought-form in Fig. 30 on the left shows an attempt to find "solace in prayer," and in this way overcome fear. This can be seen under a grayish-blue color, "which lifts itself hesitatingly upwards." Yet it is seen that judging by "the lower part of the thought-form, with its irregular outline and its falling fragments, that there is in reality almost as much fright here" as in the case on the right. Thus, one person has a chance to restore "self-control," while the other remains "an abject slave to overwhelming emotion." The thought-form at upper has been created by a member of the ship crew responsible for the lives of passengers, and it demonstrates a "very striking contrast" of the weakness manifesting in two forms from below. Herein shown "a powerful, clear-cut and definite thought, obviously full" of energy and determination. Orange color speaks of his confidence in ability to manage with the difficulty. The "brilliant yellow" means that his intellect is already at work upon the problem.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=57}}{{refn|group=note|Gray color of a specific shade demonstrates "fear and terror." Orange of a "bright shade, represents pride and ambition." Yellow, in its diverse tones, shows "intellectual power."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=64, 65}}}} 
[[File:Form31.jpg|left|thumb|220px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 31. On the First Night.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=59|Breen|2014|2p=112}}{{refn|group=note|"Figure 31 is another narrative piece."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=112}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
Fig. 31 is another declarative piece, depicting "the thought-form of an actor while waiting to go upon the stage." The authors expound that the orange band indicates self-confidence,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"yet in spite of this there is a good deal of unavoidable uncertainty as to how this new play may strike the fickle public, and on the whole the doubt and fear overbalance the certainty and pride, for there is more of the pale grey than of the orange, and the whole thought-form vibrates like a flag flapping in a gale of wind." {{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=59|Breen|2014|2p=112}}{{refn|group=note|Gray color represents fear. Bright orange shows "pride and ambition."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=64, 65}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Form34.jpg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 34. At a Funeral.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=62|Gettings|1987|2p=48}}{{refn|group=note|"The highly contrasting pair of thought forms observed by a clairvoyant at a funeral."{{sfn|Gettings|1979|p=137}} "The atmosphere at a funeral [two forms]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the thought-form on the left in Fig. 34, as the authors explain, there is nothing but "the highest and most beautiful" feelings. At the base of the thought-form, you can see "a full expression of deep sympathy," the light green color shows the understanding of the suffering of the deceased's relatives and condolence with them, and the strip "of deeper green shows the attitude of the thinker towards the dead man himself." The dense rose-color shows love to both the deceased and the surrounding, while the upper part, consisting of a cone and stars above it, indicates a feeling in connection with thoughts of death: the blue express "its devotional aspect," while as "the violet shows the thought of, and the power to respond to, a noble ideal" and the ability to match, the stars reflect "the spiritual aspirations."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=62}}{{refn|group=note|According to Gettings, the thought-form to the left is a spiritual one "which was a result of the highest meditation in the face of the loss of the loved one."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}} "Pale, luminous blue-green" shows deep sympathy and compassion. "Luminous lilac-blue, usually accompanied by sparkling golden stars" is associated with a high level of spirituality and noble aspirations. Rose color expresses selfless love.{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=12}}}} In the same figure, the thought-form on the right reflects nothing but only "profound depression, fear and selfishness." His only definite feelings are despair and the sense of his personal loss, and these show themselves in proper strips of brown-grey and leaden grey color, while the "very curious downward protrusion" demonstrates the strong selfish desire to raise the dead man into his earth life.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=62}}{{refn|group=note|Dark gray color represents "depression and melancholy."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=64}}}}{{refn|group=note|Gettings wrote that the form to the right demonstrates a distress of the materialist forming from the mind of one "who is unable to accept that death is a liberation into a higher world, and the proboscis-like feeler which runs from the base of this thought form is said to be reaching into the grave, as if to bring back the dead body."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}} "The man who had lived in the ordinary blank ignorance with regard to death, had no thought in connection with it but selfish fear and depression; whereas the man who understood the facts was entirely free from any suggestion of those feelings, for the only sentiments evoked in him were those of sympathy and affection for the mourners, and of devotion and high aspiration."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 11}}}}

The description of the event depicted in the book on Fig. 38, as noted a historian Breen, "anticipates the 1960s" as well with its conjunction of meditation and idealism: this thought-form was "generated by one who was trying, while sitting in [[meditation]], to fill his mind with an aspiration to enfold all mankind in order to draw them upward towards the high ideal which shone so clearly before his eyes."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=67|Breen|2014|2p=113}} The ability of the authors to see the "vibrations of ideas, emotions,  and sounds" demonstrates, in his opinion, "a sort of [[spirit]]ual [[synesthesia]]" which transform the religious act into a [[Neurology|neurological]] phenomenon.{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=110}}

The authors write that the thought-form shown in Fig. 41 was accompanied by "the devotional aspiration" to that [[Logos]] may thus be manifested through the man in meditation. It is this religious feeling gives a "pale blue" shade to the five-pointed star. This form has been used "for many ages as a symbol of God manifest in man."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=69}}{{refn|group=note|Thought-forms created by men who have "mind and emotion well under control and definitely trained in meditation, are clear, symmetrical objects."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=58}} Light blue color, of a "peculiarly clear and luminous shade, represents spirituality."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=66}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Breen, this thought-form looks like a kind of [[logo]]s in advertising: it can be easily taken as an old oil company sign, "competing with [[Esso]], [[British Petroleum]]and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]."{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=112–113}} Nevertheless, according to Bailey, our solar system is the manifested "thought-form" of its Logos.{{sfn|Bailey|1925|p=556}}}}{{refn|group=note|The diversity of guises of thought-forms is almost endless.

Plate M showing the form created by music of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] "depicts yellow, red, blue and green lines rising out of a church." This, as the authors explain, "signifies the movement of one of the parts of the melody, the four moving approximately together denoting the treble, alto, tenor and bass respectively." Moreover, "the scalloped edging surrounding the whole is the result of various flourishes and [[arpeggio]]s, and the floating crescents in the centre represent isolated or [[staccato]] chords."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=77|Breen|2014|2p=110}}{{refn|group=note|Lachman named the musical forms of Besant and Leadbeater "the synaesthetic forms created by music."{{sfn|Lachman|2008}} In the first part of her article ''[[Occult or Exact Science?]]'' Blavatsky described in detail the multiple phenomena of color-sound vision.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1956|pp=57–58}}}}

According to professor [[Robert Ellwood|Ellwood]], the book by Besant and Leadbeater had a large influence on [[modern art]]. "It suggested, to a world moving rapidly beyond the literalism of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art, the expression in painting of [[Surrealism|surreal]] forms and forces underlying, but different from, the visible world."{{sfn|Ellwood}} ''Thought-Forms'' demonstrated how the symbolism of "astral colors and forms" can express the specificity of "certain soul's and mental states." It had a great influence on [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]{{sfn|Kramer|1995}}{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}{{refn|group=note|The ideas which Kandinsky "elaborated in numerous notes and articles, including the now iconic text ''On the Spiritual in Art,'' were a combination of Besant and Leadbeater's theories on thought-forms, [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner's]] considerations of colour, music, and vibration, [and] theories about synaesthesia."{{sfn|Johnston|2012|p=159}} Kandinsky "owned a German translation" (1908 edition) of the book ''Thought-Forms.''{{sfn|Gettings|1978|p=135}}}} as one of the essential factors that led to the "genius opening of new perspectives for painting."{{sfn|Бычков|2007|p=83}}{{refn|group=note|According to Lachman, one Kandinsky's painting in which the "influence of ''Thought-Forms'' is quite visible" is [http://www.wassilykandinsky.ru/work-186.php ''Woman in Moscow'' (1912).]{{sfn|Lachman|2008}} Also one of Kandinsky's paintings "is similar" to the musical form from the book of Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Alvarenga|2011}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Jones, two Leadbeater's books are "relevant to [[František Kupka|Kupka's]] search for the immaterial: ''Clairvoyance'' (1899) and ''Thought-Forms'' (1901), co-written with Besant."{{sfn|Jones|2012|p=51}}}}

According to reminiscences by [[Leonid Sabaneyev|Sabaneyev]], besides ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] interested a magazine ''Vestnik Theosofii,'' which published [from 1908] the translations of Besant and Leadbeater's works.{{sfn|Сабанеев|2000|p=63}}{{sfn|Архив ВТ}} Apparently, being impressed by theirs theosophical works, he once said that "strong, powerful thought creates a thought-form so intense that it, in addition to the will, flows into the consciousness of other people."{{sfn|Сабанеев|2000|p=307}}{{refn|group=note|According to an Ukrainian philosopher Julia Shabanova, a book ''Thought-Forms'' was being "discussed" by Alexander Scriabin and [[Jean Delville]], a Belgian [[symbolist]] painter.{{sfn|Шабанова}}}} The perform of the [[Part (music)|part]] of light in [[Prometheus: The Poem of Fire|''Prometheus'']] he imagined in the form of a radiance of some "luminous matter," which was supposed to fill the hall.{{sfn|Сабанеев|2000|p=70}}{{refn|group=note|"Scriabin introduced many Theosophical ideas into his compositions and also experimented with 'synesthesia,' the strange experience of 'hearing colors' and 'seeing music'."{{sfn|Lachman|2002}}}}{{refn|group=note|See also: [[Clavier à lumières]]}}

A historian Breen wrote that Besant and Leadbeater were well aware how annoying stuff may be their book for a "society that remained deeply conservative." In early January 1901, when this book was published, "[[Queen Victoria]] still ruled England. '[[Modernism]]' as a movement or even a concept did not exist. When we consider this world of 1901, – further wrote Breen, – it becomes difficult not to believe that Besant, Leadbeater and their milieu deserve a more prominent place in the annals of both abstract art and the history of modernism." As the art critic [[Hilton Kramer|Kramer]] has pointed, "what is particularly striking about the outlook of the artists primarily responsible for creating [[Abstract art|abstraction]] is their espousal of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|occult doctrine]]."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=113}} [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]], [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]], Kandinsky, and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] were charmed by Theosophy.{{refn|group=note|[[Max Beckmann|Beckmann]] who was "impressed" by the book ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' he read in 1934 made several different sketches "on the theme" of its second volume ''Anthropogenesis.'' The album with these sketches is in the Washington [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery]].{{sfn|Бычков|2009|p=171}}}} In the first decades of the twentieth century, it was a widespread "component of Western cultural life."{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=113–114}}{{refn|group=note|"[[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] famously quoted [[Vedas|Vedic scripture]]... when he witnessed the first atomic bomb blast. But in the context of figures like Besant and Ledbetter, Oppenheimer's fascination with Eastern [[mysticism]] seems less like a personal quirk and more like a thread in a larger tapestry: an interweaving of mysticism, technology, and art that began at the turn of the last century and is still with us in the twenty-first."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=114}}}}

Thus, Besant and Ledbetter had played, summed up Breen, "a small but intriguing role in shaping the globalized culture... which weaves together [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]], mysticism and rationalism, sound and sight."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=114}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Albert Goldman|Goldman]], [[Elvis Presley|Presley]] interested the books by Blavatsky "and those of her disciples" Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Goldman|1981|p=366}} Leadbeater's ''Inner Life'' has belonged to his favourite books, and he often read from it "aloud before going on stage to perform."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=10}}}}{{See also|Synesthesia#Art}}

== Criticism ==
{{criticism section|date=July 2018}}
An academic science names the activities of such "investigators," as the authors of this book, "[[pseudoscience]]", because it based on a concept of the [[extrasensory perception]].{{sfn|Carroll|2003}} The belief in existence of thought-forms "remains influential today" for the Theosophists, followers of [[New Thought]], [[New Age]] and in [[Neopaganism|neopagan movements]], including [[Wicca]].{{sfn|Keller|2006|pp=755–756}}{{sfn|Wessinger|2013|p=44}}

[[File:Portrait tattoo.jpg|thumb|Tattoos are common examples of tie signs that signify a relationship between the wearer and the subject of the tattoo.]]'''Tie signs''' are signs, signals, and symbols, that are revealed through people's actions as well as objects such as engagement rings, wedding bands, and photographs of a personal nature that suggest a relationship exists between two people.  For romantic couples, [[Public display of affection|public displays of affection (PDA)]] including things like holding hands, an arm around a partner’s shoulders or waist, extended periods of physical contact, greater-than-normal levels of physical proximity, grooming one’s partner, and “sweet talk” are all examples of common tie signs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Manwatching: A Field Guide to Human Behavior|last1=Morris|first1=Desmond|date=1977|publisher=H.N. Abrams|isbn=0810913100|location=New York, NY|pages=86–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tie signs inform the participants, as well as outsiders, about the nature of a relationship, its condition, and even what stage a relationship is in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Young couple standing in a field, the man with right arm around the woman's shoulder LCCN2015650129.jpg|thumb|Holding someone close is an example of a tie sign, as are photographs of such actions]]

== Background ==
Origination of the term "tie sign" has been attributed to [[Desmond Morris]], an English zoologist and author, by at least one source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803104617120|title=Oxford Reference|website=oxfordreference.com|accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Erving Goffman]] is also credited with employing the term in 1959, almost two decades earlier&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking Relationships|last=Duck|first=Steve|publisher=Sage|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4129-5876-9|location=|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Usage ==
[[File:Holding hands (34305602934).jpg|thumb|Couples holding hands in public is a common tie sign]]
Nearly anything can be a tie sign, whether it is an action or an object, depending on the context in which it is observed. The majority of the time, the term tie sign is directed toward relational couples, but it can also apply to groups like families and friends. Additionally, "name-dropping" is an example a type of non-romantic tie sign&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; wherein someone attempts to communicate to others that a relationship exists between the speaker and the person he or she has named.

=== Dependence on context ===
Morris relates that one of the difficulties associated with understanding tie signs is that almost anything can qualify as one, depending on the circumstances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, even though holding hands is a common tie sign, there is an obvious difference between a man and a woman holding hands as they stand on the alter at a wedding when compared to a female physician holding a male patient's hand in a doctor's office. Goffman echoes this sentiment when he says, "a tie-sign is in fact dependent on the context for its meaning."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1433020|title=Relations in public; microstudies of the public order|last=Erving|first=Goffman|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1972|isbn=0060902760|location=New York,|oclc=1433020}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Facebook Like React.png|thumb|"Liking" someone's Facebook page is an example of tie sign via social media]]

=== Use of tie signs in social media ===
The advent of social media has created a newer conduit for tie signs.  In addition to broadcasting images of a couple exhibiting traditional tie signs like kissing, holding hands, hugging, pictures of weddings, and engagement rings, etc., social media provides the opportunity for other signals such as "liking" someone's page or tagging another person in a picture. Additionally, although observers may not witness the act of "liking" as it occurs, evidence of such actions persist on the recipient's page for others to see over time.

There is some evidence that ceasing to use social media for relational maintenance purposes could contribute to "alienation and relational de-escalation", while it would not have been a problem in the past simply because the opportunity to communicate via social media was not an option.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sosik|first=Victoria Schwanda|last2=Bazarova|first2=Natalya N.|year=2014|title=Relational maintenance on social network sites: How Facebook communication predicts relational escalation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.02.044|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=35|pages=124–131|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.02.044|issn=0747-5632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Afifi and Johnson ===
Walid A. Afifi and Michelle L. Johnson researched cross-sex friendships (those between a man and a woman) and how the use of tie signs in less-than-romantic relationships differ from the same tie signs when they are used in romantic cross-sex relationships.  For example, hugging as a greeting is an accepted tie sign for both cross-sex friendship as well as cross-sex romantic relationships.  Afifi and Johnson note some differences between sexes in the meanings behind tie signs in certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Afifi|first=Walid A.|last2=Johnson|first2=Michelle L.|year=1999|title=The Use and Interpretation of Tie Signs in a Public Setting: Relationship and Sex Differences|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0265407599161002|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|volume=16|issue=1|pages=9–38|doi=10.1177/0265407599161002|issn=0265-4075}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, women, more often than men, stated their use of tie signs was intended to "express inclusion and intimacy."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Afifi and Johnson also suggest that less-than-overt tie signs are often ambiguous even with knowledge of the context and the present state of the relationship.  It is for this reason that [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] argues that a tie sign is informative in nature and not a type of communication or language that can stand on its own.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Goffman===
Like Morris, Goffman's work on tie signs, copyrighted in 1971,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; was more descriptive than it was research-based because he was defining a new concept.  In so doing, Goffman focuses on relationships between two people (dyadic), and refers to the participants as both "pegs" and "ends" that are joined in "anchored relations,"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as well as the way intentional and unintentional actions that are exhibited by the pair reflect the current state of their relationship.  Goffman argues that tie signs are "ritual idioms"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; that contain information as opposed to a particular message, in large part because tie signs are often susceptible to incorrect interpretations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In turn, third party observers tend to look for additional tie signs in order to confirm or deny their suspicions regarding the subjects they are observing. Goffman breaks tie-signs into three distinct categories:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# Rituals:  These are inward-facing tie signs between those in a relationship.  For example, in a new relationship, where the parties exhibit increased attentiveness toward one another by holding hands, maintaining prolonged eye contact, etc.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Ritual ties signs can be subtle or overt, but, although they may be perceptible to outsiders, they are directed inward between the participants.
# Markers:  As the name suggests, these types of tie signs are more overt and intended by at least one of the participants in a relationship to be interpreted by others that a relationship of some kind does exist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Change signals:  Things like weddings and births are examples of change signals. Change signals also generally involve a participant in the relationship taking a good bit for granted, or as Goffman puts it, "the taking of liberty."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  For example, handing a partner one's coat or purse without asking, and not giving the action a second thought, is an example of one relational "peg"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; demonstrating that a relationship exists with another.

=== Guerrero and Anderson ===
Laura K. Guerrero and Peter A. Andersen researched how touch avoidance informs on the various stages of romantic relationships.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerrero|first=Laura K.|last2=Andersen|first2=Peter A.|year=1991|title=The Waxing and Waning of Relational Intimacy: Touch as a Function of Relational Stage, Gender and Touch Avoidance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0265407591082001|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|volume=8|issue=2|pages=147–165|doi=10.1177/0265407591082001|issn=0265-4075}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Guerrero and Anderson's results quite clearly suggest a marked decrease in touching between couples once their relationship reaches a "stable" stage.  The authors' research does not determine whether the decrease in touch after reaching a "stable" condition it is no longer needed as much as when the relationship is still forming, or if need, or desire, for public touching is replaced by an increase in physical contact while in private,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; or by less overt communications and gestures such as knowing looks between pairs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Guerrero and Anderson's work supports Morris' contention that tie-signs decrease in frequency and intimacy as relationships mature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] refers to this trend as “taking liberty.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Perhaps somewhat counter intuitively on its face, a lack of touching between an “anchored pair”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is also a tie sign that can signal a pair’s relationship is in a mature and stable stage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  
[[File:Desmond Morris (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Desmond Morris]]]]

===Morris===
Like Goffman, [[Desmond Morris]]'s work with tie signs, was more descriptive in nature as he was describing a new concept, in contrast with others’research that followed. Morris defines a tie sign as "any action which indicates the existence of a personal relationship".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, he broadens and clarifies his definition by including objects such as engagement rings, family pictures, and tattoos, as well as "indirect tie signs"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; such as a couple sharing a desert after dinner, and "direct ties signs"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; such as maintaining close proximity to one another, finishing each other’s sentences, and prolonged and frequent body contact.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Sosick and Bazarova ===
Victoria Schwanda Sosik and Natalya Bazarova researched relational maintenance through social networking including an increasing sense of “staying in touch” and frequency of contact.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Even while noting a reduction in effort, or "relational maintenance cost"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; required to maintain a relationship via a social media conduit, the authors argue that activity on an acquaintance's social media page still serves to signal a shared relationship.  Sosik and Bazarova also argue there is a hierarchy of signals available including more personal, written comments posted either publicly or privately, “liking” something on the other person’s social media page, tagging the other person when active on other pages, etc.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Two differences between an in-person tie sign and a tie sign in a social media setting are first - the potentially greater size of the audience, and second - the lingering of tie signs that were generated in the past creating, in turn, a prolonged signal to any who see it that a relationship exists.

=== Tong and Walther===
In Wright and Webb's book ''Computer-Mediated Communication in Personal Relationships'',&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/667213140|title=Computer-mediated communication in personal relationships|date=2011|publisher=Peter Lang|others=Wright, Kevin B., Webb, Lynne M.|isbn=9781433110818|location=New York|oclc=667213140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephanie Tom Tong and [[Joseph Walther]] explore whether social media activity is additive to relational maintenance between people that are not dispersed geographically and otherwise have social contact with one another.  Even thought people may have a relationship outside of social media, they still often choose to demonstrate to others that a relationship exists with tie signs that are delivered via social media platforms.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Critique ==
In "Relations in Public", Goffman concedes that his review of tie-signs is focused on Western society of the time.  And, specifically to "middle-class American[s]."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There may be some benefit for future research on the effects of broadcasting tie signs through social media, and what impact they may have on relationships.  Such as, whether the larger number of witnesses and lingering representation of a tie sign that is preserved in social media might be perceived as magnifying the significance of what is otherwise a seemingly small gesture.
