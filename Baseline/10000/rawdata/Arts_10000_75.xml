'''Alberto Randegger''' (13 April 1832 – 18 December 1911) was an Italian-born composer, conductor and singing teacher, best known for promoting [[opera]] and new works of British music in England during the [[Victorian era]] and for his widely used textbook on singing technique.

==Life and career==
Randegger was born in [[Trieste]], [[Italy]], the son of musician mother and schoolteacher father. He met [[Giuseppe Verdi]] in Trieste, in 1850, and later became known as a great interpreter of Verdi's operas.&lt;ref&gt;"Alberto Randegger". ''The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular'', Vol. 40, No. 680, 1 October 1899, pp. 653-58&lt;/ref&gt; He was a pupil of Jean Lafont in piano and of [[Luigi Ricci (composer)|Luigi Ricci]] in composition.&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"&gt;{{NIE |inline=1 |title=Randegger, Alberto |year=1914 |edition=2nd |volume=19 |page=539 |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/njp.32101064517277?urlappend=%3Bseq=615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
His earliest compositions were masses and other pieces of church music and, with two other young pupils of Ricci, produced two [[ballet]]s and an [[opera]], ''Il Lazzarone,'' in 1852. In 1854 he composed another opera, ''Bianca Capello'', at [[Brescia]].&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt; During this period, he also served as music director of theatres in [[Fiume]], [[Senigallia]], Brescia and [[Venice]].&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Grove, George, et al.

Randegger began work in London as an organist at St. Paul's in [[Regent's Park]] from his arrival there, in 1854, until 1879.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Beginning in 1857, he conducted Italian opera at the [[St. James's Theatre]].&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt;  He also became well known as a teacher of singing in [[London]], both privately and at the [[Royal College of Music]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Beginning in 1868, he was conductor at the Wolverhampton Festival.   The same year, he was appointed [[professor]] of singing at the [[Royal Academy of Music]],&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt; where he was appointed a director and a member of the committee of management.  He continued teaching at both the College and the Academy until his death.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;  His notable pupils included sopranos [[Liza Lehmann]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Baker | first = Theodore | contribution = Lehmann, Liza | year = 1992 | title = Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, Eighth Edition | editor-last = Slonimsky | editor-first = Nicolas | pages = 1030–31 | place = New York | publisher = Schirmer Books | isbn = 0-02-872415-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greta Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;Wyndham, Henry Saxe &amp; L'Epine, Geoffrey (1915).

As a composer, in addition to his early works, Randegger wrote a [[comic opera]], ''The Rival Beauties'' (1864);&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt; the vocal scenas Medea (1869); a musical play with dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]], ''[[Creatures of Impulse]]'' (1871);{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} a dramatic [[cantata]], the ''150th Psalm'' for soprano solo, choir, orchestra, and organ (1872); ''Fridolin'' (1873); two scenes for [[soprano]] and orchestra, ''Medea'' (1869) and ''Sappho'' (1875); ''Funeral Anthem'', in memory of the Prince Consort;&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt; ''The Prayer of Nature'' (1887); and numerous other vocal pieces. He also edited several collections of vocal music and collaborated with [[T. J. H. Marzials]] on the libretto for [[Arthur Goring Thomas]]'s opera ''[[Esmeralda (opera)|Esmeralda]]'' (1883).

===Carl Rosa and later years===
[[File:Alberto Randegger 001.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Randegger {{circa|1893}}]]
Randegger served as musical director of the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] from 1879 to 1885,&lt;ref name="Colby, Williams 1914, p. 539"/&gt; helping to revive interest in opera in England. In 1880, [[George Grove]] wrote: "The careful way in which the pieces are put on the stage, the number of rehearsals, the eminence of the performers and the excellence of the performers have begun to bear their legitimate fruit, and the Carl Rosa Opera Company bids fair to become a permanent English institution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlrosaopera.co.uk/history/index.asp Information from the Carl Rosa history page]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the resignation of [[Julius Benedict]] in 1881, he also became conductor of the Norwich Musical Festival, which he directed until 1905.  There he conducted new works by Cowen, J. F. Barnett, Stanford, [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], Prout, Parry, [[Edward German]] and others, and at the 1905 Festival invited 14 British composers to conduct performances of their own works.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;  From 1885 to 1887, he also conducted [[Henry David Leslie|Henry Leslie]]'s Choir.  He conducted the Queen's Hall Choral Society and the first two seasons of symphony concerts at Queen's Hall from 1895 to 1897.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;   Finally, from 1887 to 1898, he conducted at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] and at the [[Royal Opera House]], where he became known for his performances of [[Wagner]], Verdi and [[Mozart]] operas.

Randegger's most important legacy, outside of his conducting, was a textbook entitled ''Singing'', published in 1879 by [[Novello &amp; Co]], which is still used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Johnson|first= Keith|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p174416|pure_url=yes}} |title=Alberto Randegger Biography| year=2006 |accessdate=21 May 2008 |publisher= ''Allmusic''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, Randegger was elected an honorary member of the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]].

Randegger was married first to the actress [[Adeline Hayden Coffin|Adeline de Leuw]] whom he divorced in 1892 (and who later married [[Hayden Coffin]]), and on 11 March 1897 he married the American singer [[Louise Baldwin]] (her second marriage).&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/03/23/102059211.pdf NY Times article about Randegger's marriage to Baldwin, dated March 23, 1897]&lt;/ref&gt;

Randegger died at his home in London at the age of 79.

'''Architecture''' is both the process and the product of [[planning]], [[design]]ing, and [[construction|constructing]] [[building]]s or any other [[structure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/architecture|title=architecture|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural works, in the material form of [[building]]s, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as [[work of art|works of art]]. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.

== Definitions and etymology ==

Architecture (Latin ''[[wikt:architectura#Latin|architectura]]'', from the Greek [[wikt:ἀρχιτέκτων|ἀρχιτέκτων]] ''arkhitekton'' "architect", from [[wikt:ἀρχι-|ἀρχι-]] "chief" and [[wikt:τέκτων|τέκτων]] "creator") is both the process and the product of [[planning]], [[design]]ing, and [[construction|constructing]] buildings and other physical structures.

Architecture can mean:
* A general term to describe buildings and other physical structures.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'' (1993), Oxford, {{ISBN|0 19 860575 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The art and science of [[design]]ing [[building]]s and (some) [[nonbuilding structure]]s.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;
* The style of design and method of construction of [[building]]s and other physical structures.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;
* A unifying or coherent form or structure.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage, {{ISBN|0-87779-132-5}} or {{ISBN|978-0-87779-132-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Knowledge of art, science, technology, and humanity.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;
* The design activity of the architect,&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; from the macro-level ([[urban design]], [[landscape architecture]]) to the micro-level (construction details and furniture). The practice of the [[architect]], where architecture means offering or rendering professional services in connection with the design and construction of buildings, or built environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/bills/60th_1st/3rd_read/b115.htm |title=Gov.ns.ca |publisher=Gov.ns.ca |date= |accessdate=2 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721200353/http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/bills/60th_1st/3rd_read/b115.htm |archivedate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of architecture==

===Historic treatises===
[[File:O Partenon de Atenas adj.JPG|thumb|alt=The Parthenon is a rectangular building of white marble with eight columns supporting a pediment at the front, and a long line of columns visible at the side|The [[Parthenon]], [[Athens]], [[Greece]], "the supreme example among architectural sites." [[Banister Fletcher|(Fletcher)]].&lt;ref&gt;Banister Fletcher, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The earliest surviving written work on the subject of architecture is ''[[De architectura]]'', by the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]] in the early 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="Vitruvius"&gt;D. Rowland – T.N. Howe: Vitruvius. Ten Books on Architecture. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1999, {{ISBN|0-521-00292-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vitruvius, a good building should satisfy the three principles of ''firmitas, utilitas, venustas'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gardenvisit.com/landscape/LIH/history/vitruvius.htm#ch1-3|title=Vitruvius Ten Books on Architecture, with regard to landscape and garden design|work=gardenvisit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elements"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/home.html |title=Vitruvius |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known by the original translation – ''firmness, commodity and delight''. An equivalent in modern English would be:
* Durability – a building should stand up robustly and remain in good condition.
* Utility – it should be suitable for the purposes for which it is used.
* Beauty – it should be aesthetically pleasing.
According to Vitruvius, the architect should strive to fulfill each of these three attributes as well as possible.
[[Leon Battista Alberti]], who elaborates on the ideas of Vitruvius in his treatise, ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'', saw beauty primarily as a matter of proportion, although ornament also played a part. For Alberti, the rules of proportion were those that governed the idealised human figure, the [[Golden ratio|Golden mean]].

The most important aspect of beauty was, therefore, an inherent part of an object, rather than something applied superficially, and was based on universal, recognisable truths. The notion of style in the arts was not developed until the 16th century, with the writing of [[Vasari]]:&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Choay, ''Alberti and Vitruvius'', editor, Joseph Rykwert, Profile 21, Architectural Design, Vol. 49 No. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; by the 18th century, his [[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]] had been translated into Italian, French, Spanish, and English.

[[File:Vitruvianischer Mann.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient Roman architect Vitruvius described in his theory of proper architecture, the [[Vitruvian man|proportions of a man]].]]

In the early 19th century, [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin]] wrote ''Contrasts'' (1836) that, as the titled suggested, contrasted the modern, industrial world, which he disparaged, with an idealized image of neo-medieval world. [[Gothic architecture]], Pugin believed, was the only "true Christian form of architecture."

The 19th-century English art critic, [[John Ruskin]], in his ''[[Seven Lamps of Architecture]]'', published 1849, was much narrower in his view of what constituted architecture. Architecture was the "art which so disposes and adorns the edifices raised by men ... that the sight of them" contributes "to his mental health, power, and pleasure".&lt;ref name=Ruskin&gt;John Ruskin, ''The Seven Lamps of Architecture'', G. Allen (1880), reprinted Dover, (1989) {{ISBN|0-486-26145-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Ruskin, the aesthetic was of overriding significance. His work goes on to state that a building is not truly a work of architecture unless it is in some way "adorned". For Ruskin, a well-constructed, well-proportioned, functional building needed string [[Course (architecture)|courses]] or [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]], at the very least.&lt;ref name=Ruskin/&gt;

On the difference between the ideals of ''architecture'' and mere ''[[construction]]'', the renowned 20th-century architect [[Le Corbusier]] wrote: "You employ stone, wood, and concrete, and with these materials you build houses and palaces: that is construction. Ingenuity is at work. But suddenly you touch my heart, you do me good. I am happy and I say: This is beautiful. That is Architecture".&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Towards a New Architecture'', Dover Publications(1985). {{ISBN|0-486-25023-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Corbusier's contemporary [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] said "Architecture starts when you carefully put two bricks together. There it begins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/l/ludwigmies116040.html|title=Architecture starts when you carefully put two bricks together. There it begins. - Ludwig Mies van der Rohe at BrainyQuote|work=BrainyQuote}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern concepts===
The notable 19th-century architect of skyscrapers, [[Louis Sullivan]], promoted an overriding precept to architectural design: "[[Form follows function]]".

While the notion that structural and aesthetic considerations should be entirely subject to functionality was met with both popularity and skepticism, it had the effect of introducing the concept of "function" in place of [[Vitruvius]]' "utility". "Function" came to be seen as encompassing all criteria of the use, perception and enjoyment of a [[building]], not only practical but also aesthetic, psychological and cultural.

[[File:Sydney Opera House Sails edit02 adj.JPG|left|thumb|alt=The Sydney Opera House appears to float on the harbour. It has numerous roof-sections which are shaped like huge shining white sails|[[Sydney Opera House]], Australia designed by [[Jørn Utzon]]]]

Nunzia Rondanini stated, "Through its aesthetic dimension architecture goes beyond the functional aspects that it has in common with other human sciences. Through its own particular way of expressing [[Architectural design values|values]], architecture can stimulate and influence social life without presuming that, in and of itself, it will promote social development.'

To restrict the meaning of (architectural) formalism to art for art's sake is not only reactionary; it can also be a purposeless quest for perfection or originality which degrades form into a mere instrumentality".&lt;ref&gt;Rondanini, Nunzia ''Architecture and Social Change'' Heresies II, Vol. 3, No. 3, New York, Neresies Collective Inc., 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the philosophies that have influenced modern architects and their approach to building design are [[rationalism]], [[empiricism]], [[structuralism]], [[poststructuralism]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

In the late 20th century a new concept was added to those included in the compass of both structure and function, the consideration of [[sustainability]], hence [[sustainable architecture]]. To satisfy the contemporary ethos a building should be constructed in a manner which is environmentally friendly in terms of the production of its materials, its impact upon the natural and built environment of its surrounding area and the demands that it makes upon non-sustainable power sources for heating, cooling, water and waste management and [[lighting]].

===Philosophy of architecture===
{{main|Philosophy of architecture}}
[[File:Wittgenstein haus.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Wittgenstein House]]]]

'''Philosophy of Architecture''' is a branch of [[philosophy of art]], dealing with aesthetic value of architecture, its [[semantics]] and relations with development of [[culture]].

[[Plato]] to [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Robert Venturi]] as well as many other philosophers and theoreticians, distinguish architecture ('technion') from building ('demiorgos'), attributing the former to mental traits, and the latter to the divine or natural.&lt;ref&gt;“It is not the line that is between two points, but the point that is at the intersection of several lines.”  Deleuze, Gilles.  Pourparlers Paris: Minuit, 1990 p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wittgenstein House]] is considered one of the most important examples of interactions between philosophy and architecture. Built by renowned [[Austria]]n philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], the house has been the subject of extensive research about the relationship between its stylistic features, Wittgenstein's personality, and his philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb G.

===Origins and vernacular architecture===
[[File:Malta Valletta BW 2011-10-07 14-55-01.JPG|left|thumb|Pre-historic model of a planned pre-historic temple, at the [[National Museum of Archaeology, Malta|National Museum of Archaeology]] in [[Valletta]]]]
{{main|Vernacular architecture}}
Building first evolved out of the dynamics between needs (shelter, security, worship, etc.) and means (available [[building material]]s and attendant skills). As human cultures developed and knowledge began to be formalized through oral traditions and practices, building became a [[craft]], and "architecture" is the name given to the most highly formalized and respected versions of that craft.
It is widely assumed that architectural success was the product of a process of trial and error, with progressively less trial and more replication as the results of the process proved increasingly satisfactory. What is termed [[vernacular architecture]] continues to be produced in many parts of the world. Indeed, vernacular buildings make up most of the built world that people experience every day.
Early human settlements were mostly [[rural]]. Due to a surplus in production the economy began to expand resulting in urbanization thus creating [[urban area]]s which grew and evolved very rapidly in some cases, such as that of [[Çatal Höyük]] in [[Anatolia]] and [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]] of the Indus Valley Civilization in modern-day [[Pakistan]].

===Ancient architecture===
In many ancient civilizations, such as those of Egypt and Mesopotamia, architecture and urbanism reflected the constant engagement with the divine and the [[supernatural]], and many ancient cultures resorted to monumentality in architecture to represent symbolically the political power of the ruler, the ruling elite, or the state itself.

The architecture and [[urbanism]] of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical civilizations]] such as the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] evolved from civic ideals rather than religious or empirical ones and new building types emerged. Architectural "style" developed in the form of the [[Classical orders]]. Roman architecture was influenced by Greek architecture as they incorporated many Greek elements into their building practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/greek-art/beginners-guide-greece/a/introduction-to-greek-architecture|title=Introduction to Greek architecture|last=|first=|date=|website=Khan Academy|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014123040/http://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/greek-art/beginners-guide-greece/a/introduction-to-greek-architecture|archive-date=2014-10-14|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Texts on architecture have been written since ancient time. These texts provided both general advice and specific formal prescriptions or canons. Some examples of canons are found in the writings of the 1st-century BCE Roman Architect [[Vitruvius]]. Some of the most important early examples of canonic architecture are religious.

===Asian architecture===
Early Asian writings on architecture include the ''Kao Gong Ji'' of China from the 7th–5th centuries BCE; the [[Shilpa Shastras]] of ancient India;  [[Manjusri Vasthu Vidya Sastra]] of [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Araniko]] of [[Nepal]] .

The architecture of different parts of [[Asia]] developed along different lines from that of Europe; Buddhist, Hindu and Sikh architecture each having different characteristics. Buddhist architecture, in particular, showed great regional diversity. Hindu temple architecture, which developed around the 3rd century BCE, is governed by concepts laid down in the Shastras, and is concerned with expressing the macrocosm and the microcosm. In many [[Asia]]n countries, pantheistic religion led to architectural forms that were designed specifically to enhance the [[natural landscape]].

===Islamic architecture===
Islamic architecture began in the 7th century [[Common Era|CE]], incorporating architectural forms from the ancient [[Middle East]] and [[Byzantium]], but also developing features to suit the religious and social needs of the society. Examples can be found throughout the Middle East, North Africa, Spain and the Indian Sub-continent.

===Middle Ages===
In [[Europe]] during the [[Medieval]] period, [[guild]]s were formed by craftsmen to organise their trades and written contracts have survived, particularly in relation to ecclesiastical buildings. The role of architect was usually one with that of master mason, or ''Magister lathomorum'' as they are sometimes described in contemporary documents.

The major architectural undertakings were the buildings of abbeys and [[cathedral]]s. From about 900 CE onwards, the movements of both clerics and tradesmen carried architectural knowledge across Europe, resulting in the pan-European styles [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]].

===Renaissance and the architect===
{{Main|Renaissance architecture}}
In [[Renaissance]] Europe, from about 1400 onwards, there was a revival of Classical learning accompanied by the development of [[Renaissance Humanism]] which placed greater emphasis on the role of the individual in society than had been the case during the Medieval period. Buildings were ascribed to specific architects – [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Palladio]] – and the cult of the individual had begun. There was still no dividing line between [[artist]], [[architect]] and [[engineer]], or any of the related vocations, and the appellation was often one of regional preference.

A revival of the Classical style in architecture was accompanied by a burgeoning of science and engineering which affected the proportions and structure of buildings. At this stage, it was still possible for an artist to design a bridge as the level of structural calculations involved was within the scope of the generalist.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Early modern and the industrial age===
With the emerging knowledge in scientific fields and the rise of new materials and technology, architecture and [[engineering]] began to separate, and the architect began to concentrate on [[aesthetics]] and the humanist aspects, often at the expense of technical aspects of building design. There was also the rise of the "gentleman architect" who usually dealt with wealthy clients and concentrated predominantly on visual qualities derived usually from historical prototypes, typified by the many country houses of Great Britain that were created in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo Gothic]] or [[Scottish Baronial]] styles.
Formal architectural training in the 19th century, for example at [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in France, gave much emphasis to the production of beautiful drawings and little to context and feasibility.

Meanwhile, the [[Industrial Revolution]] laid open the door for mass production and consumption. Aesthetics became a criterion for the middle class as ornamented products, once within the province of expensive craftsmanship, became cheaper under machine production.

[[Vernacular architecture]] became increasingly ornamental. House builders could use current architectural design in their work by combining features found in pattern books and architectural journals.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Modernism===
{{Main|Modern architecture}}

Around the beginning of the 20th century, a general dissatisfaction with the emphasis on revivalist architecture and elaborate decoration gave rise to many new lines of thought that served as precursors to Modern Architecture. Notable among these is the [[Deutscher Werkbund]], formed in 1907 to produce better quality machine made objects. The rise of the profession of industrial design is usually placed here. Following this lead, the [[Bauhaus]] school, founded in [[Weimar]], Germany in 1919, redefined the architectural bounds prior set throughout history, viewing the creation of a building as the ultimate synthesis—the apex—of art, craft, and technology.

When [[modern architecture]] was first practiced, it was an [[avant-garde]] movement with moral, philosophical, and aesthetic underpinnings. Immediately after [[World War I]], pioneering modernist architects sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post-war social and economic order, focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes. They rejected the architectural practice of the academic refinement of historical styles which served the rapidly declining aristocratic order. The approach of the Modernist architects was to reduce buildings to pure forms, removing historical references and ornament in favor of functionalist details. Buildings displayed their functional and structural elements, exposing steel beams and concrete surfaces instead of hiding them behind decorative forms. Architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] developed [[organic architecture]], in which the form was defined by its environment and purpose, with an aim to promote harmony between human habitation and the natural world with prime examples being [[Robie House]] and [[Fallingwater]].

Architects such as [[Mies van der Rohe]], [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Marcel Breuer]] worked to create beauty based on the inherent qualities of building materials and modern construction techniques, trading traditional historic forms for simplified geometric forms, celebrating the new means and methods made possible by the [[Industrial Revolution]], including steel-frame construction, which gave birth to high-rise superstructures. [[Fazlur Rahman Khan]]'s development of the [[Tube (structure)|tube structure]] was a technological break-through in building ever higher.  By mid-century, Modernism had morphed into the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]], an aesthetic epitomized in many ways by the Twin Towers of New York's [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] designed by [[Minoru Yamasaki]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Postmodernism===
{{main|Postmodern architecture}}

Many architects resisted [[modernism]], finding it devoid of the decorative richness of historical styles. As the first generation of modernists began to die after [[World War II]], a second generation of architects including [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], [[Marcel Breuer]], and [[Eero Saarinen]] tried to expand the aesthetics of modernism with [[Brutalism]], buildings with expressive sculptural façades made of unfinished concrete. But an even new younger postwar generation critiqued modernism and Brutalism for being too austere, standardized, monotone, and not taking into account the richness of human experience offered in historical buildings across time and in different places and cultures.

One such reaction to the cold aesthetic of modernism and Brutalism is the school of [[metaphoric architecture]], which includes such things as [[biomorphism]] and [[zoomorphic architecture]], both using nature as the primary source of inspiration and design.  While it is considered by some to be merely an aspect of [[postmodernism]], others consider it to be a school in its own right and a later development of [[expressionist architecture]].&lt;ref name=metaphor&gt;

Beginning in the late 1950s and 1960s, [[architectural phenomenology]] emerged as an important movement in the early reaction against modernism, with architects like [[Charles Moore (architect)|Charles Moore]] in the United States, [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]] in Norway, and [[Ernesto Nathan Rogers]] and [[Vittorio Gregotti]], [[Michele Valori]], [[Bruno Zevi]] in Italy, who collectively popularized an interest in a new contemporary architecture aimed at expanding human experience using historical buildings as models and precedents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Otero-Pailos  | first =Jorge  | title =Architecture's Historical Turn: Phenomenology and the Rise of the Postmodern  | publisher =University of Minnesota Press| year =2010 | location = Minneapolis| pages =  | url =https://books.google.com/?id=3WDOQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=architecture's%20historical%20turn  | isbn=9780816666041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials, with the aesthetics of older pre-modern and non-modern styles, from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles. [[Robert Venturi]] famously defined postmodern architecture as a "decorated shed" (an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside), and upheld it against modernist and brutalist "ducks" (buildings with unnecessarily expressive tectonic forms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Venturi  | first =Robert  | title =Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture  | publisher =Museum of Modern Art| year =1966 | location = New York| pages =| url =https://books.google.com/?id=0c1OQwAACAAJ&amp;dq=complexity+and+contradiction+in+architecture | isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture today===
{{Main|Contemporary architecture}}
Since the 1980s, as the complexity of buildings began to increase (in terms of structural systems, services, energy and technologies), the field of architecture became multi-disciplinary with specializations for each project type, technological expertise or project delivery methods. In addition, there has been an increased separation of the 'design' architect &lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;A design architect is one who is responsible for the design.&lt;/ref&gt; from the 'project' architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of liability.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;A project architect is one who is responsible for ensuring the design is built correctly and who administers building contracts – in non-specialist architectural practices the project architect is also the design architect and the term refers to the differing roles the architect plays at differing stages of the process.&lt;/ref&gt; The preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated, and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability, sustainability, quality, money, and compliance with local laws. A large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many.
[[Modern architecture|Modernism]] and [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodernism]] have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal, philosophical, or aesthetic pursuit by individualists; rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments, with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral, environmental, and social sciences.

Environmental [[sustainability]] has become a mainstream issue, with profound effect on the architectural profession. Many developers, those who support the financing of buildings, have become educated to encourage the facilitation of environmentally sustainable design, rather than solutions based primarily on immediate cost. Major examples of this can be found in [[passive solar building design]], [[Green roof|greener roof designs]], [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] materials, and more attention to a structure's energy usage. This major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment. There has been an acceleration in the number of buildings which seek to meet [[green building]] [[sustainable design]] principles. Sustainable practices that were at the core of vernacular architecture increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially sustainable contemporary techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=OneWorld.net |url=http://el.doccentre.info/eldoc/0411/dwvernacular_architecture.html |title=Vernacular Architecture in India |publisher=El.doccentre.info |date=31 March 2004 |accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Green Building Council's [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system has been instrumental in this.&lt;ref&gt;Other [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and green building rating systems include Energy Star, Green Globes, and CHPS ([[Collaborative for High Performance Schools]]).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quantify|date=July 2016}}

Concurrently, the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]], [[metaphoric architecture]] and [[New Classical Architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnu.org/charter|title=The Charter of the New Urbanism|work=cnu.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as leaning against solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities].

===Cognitive architecture===
{{main|Cognitive architecture}}

Cognitive architecture can refer to a theory about the structure of the [[human mind]]. One of the main goals of a cognitive architecture is to summarize the various results of [[cognitive psychology]] in a comprehensive [[computer model]]. However, the results need to be in a formalized form so far that they can be the basis of a [[computer program]]. The formalized models can be used to further refine a comprehensive theory of [[cognition]], and more immediately, as a commercially usable model. Successful cognitive architectures include [[ACT-R]] (Adaptive Control of Thought, ACT) and [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|SOAR]].

The [[Institute of Creative Technologies]] defines cognitive architecture as: "hypothesis about the fixed structures that provide a mind, whether in natural or artificial systems, and how they work together – in conjunction with knowledge and skills embodied within the architecture – to yield intelligent behavior in a diversity of complex environments."&lt;ref&gt;Refer to the ICT website: http://cogarch.ict.usc.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer architecture===

===Enterprise architecture===
{{main|Enterprise architecture}}

Enterprise architecture ('''EA''') is "a well-defined practice for conducting [[enterprise (economics)|enterprise]] analysis, design, planning, and implementation, using a holistic approach at all times, for the successful development and execution of strategy. Enterprise architecture applies architecture principles and practices to guide organizations through the business, information, process, and technology changes necessary to execute their strategies. These practices utilize the various aspects of an enterprise to identify, motivate, and achieve these changes."&lt;ref name="FEAPO"&gt;[[Federation of Enterprise Architecture Professional Organizations|Federation of EA Professional Organizations]], ''[http://feapo.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Common-Perspectives-on-Enterprise-Architecture-v15.pdf Common Perspectives on Enterprise Architecture]'', ''Architecture and Governance Magazine'', Issue 9-4, November 2013 (2013). Retrieved on November 19, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners of enterprise architecture, ''[[enterprise architect]]s'', are responsible for performing the analysis of business structure and [[business process|processes]] and are often called upon to draw conclusions from the information collected to address the goals of enterprise architecture: [[effectiveness]], [[efficiency]], [[agility]], and [[:wikt:durability|durability]].&lt;ref name="PEAF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pragmaticea.com/PEAF-models.asp?ModelName=context.where-to-start.goals#entry|title=PEAF – Framework|first=Kevin Lee|last=Smith|website=www.pragmaticea.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interior architecture===
{{main|Interior architecture}}
[[File:Charles Rennie Mackintosh - Music Room 1901.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Rennie Mackintosh – Music Room 1901]]
Interior architecture is the design of a space which has been created by structural boundaries and the human interaction within these boundaries.  It can also be the initial design and plan for use, then later redesign to accommodate a changed purpose, or a significantly revised design for [[adaptive reuse]] of the building shell.&lt;ref name="intar.risd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intar.risd.edu/|title=Interior Architecture|work=RISD Interior Architecture Graduate Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is often part of [[sustainable architecture]] practices, conserving resources through "recycling" a structure by adaptive redesign.  Generally referred to as the spatial art of environmental design, form and practice, interior architecture is the process through which the interiors of buildings are designed, concerned with all aspects of the human uses of structural spaces.  Put simply, Interior Architecture is the design of an interior in architectural terms.

===Landscape architecture===
{{main|Landscape architecture}}

[[File:Orangerie.jpg|thumb|Orangery at the Palace of Versailles, outside Paris]]

Landscape architecture is the design of outdoor public areas, landmarks, and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioral, or aesthetic outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe, Susan Jellicoe, The Landscape of Man: Shaping the Environment from Prehistory to the Present Day {{ISBN|9780500274316}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the systematic investigation of existing social, ecological, and soil conditions and processes in the landscape, and the design of interventions that will produce the desired outcome.  The scope of the profession includes [[landscape design]]; [[site planning]]; [[Stormwater#Stormwater management|stormwater management]]; [[natural environment|environmental]] [[ecological restoration|restoration]]; [[park]]s and recreation planning; visual resource management; green infrastructure planning and provision; and private [[estate (land)|estate]] and [[house|residence]] landscape master planning and design; all at varying scales of design, planning and management. A practitioner in the profession of landscape architecture is called a [[landscape architect]].

===Naval architecture===
{{main|Naval architecture}}

[[File:Lines plan en.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Body plan of a ship showing the hull form]]
Naval architecture, also known as naval engineering, is an [[engineering]] discipline dealing with the [[engineering design process]], [[shipbuilding]], maintenance, and operation of [[watercraft|marine vessels]] and structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rina.org.uk/careers_in_naval_architecture.html|title=Careers in Naval Architecture|first=|last=RINA|website=www.rina.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biran, Adrian; (2003). Ship hydrostatics and stability (1st Ed.) – [[Butterworth-Heinemann]]. {{ISBN|0-7506-4988-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naval architecture involves basic and applied research, design, development, design evaluation and calculations during all stages of the life of a marine vehicle. Preliminary design of the vessel, its detailed design, [[Shipbuilding|construction]], [[Sea trial|trials]], operation and maintenance, launching and [[dry-docking]] are the main activities involved. Ship design calculations are also required for ships being [[Ship#Repair and conversion|modified]] (by means of conversion, rebuilding, modernization, or repair). Naval architecture also involves formulation of safety regulations and damage control rules and the approval and certification of ship designs to meet [[statutory]] and non-statutory requirements.

===Network architecture===
{{main|Network architecture}}

Network architecture is the design of a [[communication network]]. It is a framework for the specification of a network's [[Physical layer|physical components]] and their functional organization and configuration, its operational principles and procedures, as well as [[data type|data formats]] use. In [[telecommunication]], the specification of a network architecture may also include a detailed description of products and services delivered via a communications network, as well as detailed rate and billing structures under which services are compensated.

===Software architecture===
{{main|Software architecture}}

Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a [[software system]], the discipline of creating such structures, and the documentation of these structures. These structures are needed to reason about the software system. Each structure comprises software elements, relations among them, and properties of both elements and relations,&lt;ref name="DSA2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Paul|author2=Felix Bachmann |author3=[[Len Bass]] |author4=David Garlan |author5=James Ivers |author6=Reed Little |author7=Paulo Merson |author8=Robert Nord |author9=Judith Stafford  |title=Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond, Second Edition|publisher = Addison-Wesley|year=2010|location=Boston|isbn=0-321-55268-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[design rationale|rationale]] for the introduction and configuration of each element.
The ''architecture'' of a software system is a metaphor, analogous to the architecture of a building.&lt;ref name="PERRY1992"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Perry | first1 = D. E. | last2 = Wolf | first2 = A. L. | authorlink2 = Alexander L.

Software architecture is about making fundamental structural choices which are costly to change once implemented. Software architecture choices, also called [[architectural decision]]s, include specific structural options from possibilities in the design of software. For example, the systems that controlled the [[space shuttle]] launch vehicle had the requirement of being very fast and very reliable. Therefore, an appropriate [[real-time computing]] language would need to be chosen. Additionally, to satisfy the need for reliability the choice could be made to have multiple redundant and independently produced copies of the program, and to run these copies on independent hardware while cross-checking results.

Documenting software architecture facilitates communication between [[Stakeholder (corporate)#In management|stakeholders]], captures decisions about the architecture design, and allows reuse of design components between projects.&lt;ref name="SAP2"&gt;

System architecture is a [[conceptual model]] that defines the [[structure]], [[behavior]], and more [[view model|views]] of a [[system]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannu Jaakkola and Bernhard Thalheim. (2011) "Architecture-driven modelling methodologies." In: ''Proceedings of the 2011 conference on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases XXII''. Anneli Heimbürger et al. (eds). IOS Press. p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; An architecture description is a formal description and representation of a system, organized in a way that supports reasoning about the [[structure]]s and [[behavior]]s of the system.

A system architecture can comprise system [[System|components]] that will work together to implement the overall system. There have been efforts to formalize languages to describe system architecture, collectively these are called [[architecture description languages]] (ADLs).&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Clements (1996)  "[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/assets/Survey_of_ADLs.pdf A survey of architecture description languages]." Proceedings of the 8th international workshop on software specification and design. IEEE Computer Society, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nenad Medvidovic and Richard N. Taylor (2000). "[ftp://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/arch/papers/TR-UCI-ICS-97-02.pdf A classification and comparison framework for software architecture description languages.]" Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on 26.1 (2000): 70-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban design===
{{main|Urban design}}

Urban design is the process of designing and shaping the physical features of cities, towns and villages. In contrast to architecture, which focuses on the design of individual buildings, urban design deals with the larger scale of groups of buildings, streets and public spaces, whole neighborhoods and districts, and entire cities, with the goal of making urban areas functional, attractive, and sustainable.&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/49f234rd|author=Boeing|title=LEED-ND and Livability Revisited|journal=Berkeley Planning Journal|date=2014|volume=27|pages=31–55|accessdate=2015-04-15|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban design is an inter-disciplinary field that utilizes elements of many built environment professions, including [[landscape architecture]], [[urban planning]], architecture, [[civil engineering]] and [[municipal engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., &amp; de Jong, H. (2013). [http://plt.sagepub.com/content/12/2/177.short Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems]. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198.&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for professionals in all these disciplines to practice urban design. In more recent times different sub-subfields of urban design have emerged such as strategic urban design, [[landscape urbanism]], [[water-sensitive urban design]], and [[sustainable urbanism]].

'''Arthur David Jacobs''' (14 June 1922 – 13 December 1996) was an English musicologist, music critic, teacher, librettist and translator. Among his many books, two of the best known are his ''Penguin Dictionary of Music'', which was reprinted in several editions between 1958 and 1996, and his biography of [[Arthur Sullivan]], which was praised by critics in Britain and America. As an academic, Jacobs taught at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], at [[University of Huddersfield|Huddersfield Polytechnic]], and at universities in the US, Canada, and Australia.

==Life and career==
Jacobs was born in [[Manchester]], England, to Jewish parents, Alexander Susman Jacobs and his wife Estelle (''née'' Isaacs).&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, William D., Michael Jolles and Hilary L. Rubinstein. ''The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History'', Palgrave Macmillan (2011), pp. 464–465&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Manchester Grammar School]]&lt;ref name=ind&gt;Sadie, Stanley. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-professor-arthur-jacobs-1315344.html "Obituary: Professor Arthur Jacobs"], ''[[The Independent]]'', 20 December 1996, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Merton College, Oxford]], taking an honours degree in 1946. In World War II he served in India and Burma with the British Army, reaching the rank of lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900–1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 he married the writer Betty Upton Hughes. They had two sons, Michael Jacobs and Julian Jacobs.&lt;ref name=gale&gt;[http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/GLD/hits?r=d&amp;origSearch=true&amp;o=DataType&amp;n=10&amp;l=d&amp;c=2&amp;locID=wes_ttda&amp;secondary=false&amp;u=CA&amp;t=KW&amp;s=2&amp;TI=Gilbert+and+Sullivan&amp;SU=%22Music%22 "Arthur Jacobs"], ''Contemporary Authors Online'', Galenet (subscription required), accessed 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobs was music critic of ''The [[Daily Express]]'' from 1947 to 1952, of ''The Sunday Citizen'' from 1959 to 1965, and of ''The [[Jewish Chronicle]]'' from 1963 to 1975. He reviewed records for ''Hi-Fi News and Record Review'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' and wrote for the arts section of ''[[The Financial Times]]''.  He was deputy editor of ''[[Opera (magazine)|Opera]]'' magazine from 1961 to 1971 and served on its editorial board from 1971 until his death.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;&lt;ref name=gale/&gt;&lt;ref name=times&gt;"Arthur Jacobs", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 December 1996, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''[[The Musical Times]]'', between 1949 and 1996, Jacobs wrote on a wide variety of musical topics, including the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[Three Choirs Festival]], Russian song, ''[[The Gypsy Baron]]'', ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', the [[Metropolitan Opera]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne]], [[Otto Klemperer]], and composers from [[Handel]] to [[César Franck]] to [[Elgar]] to [[Janáček]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Musical Times'', ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1964 to 1979, Jacobs was a lecturer at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], teaching the history of opera.  He was head of the music department of Huddersfield Polytechnic (now the [[University of Huddersfield]]) 1979–84, where he was appointed to a personal professorship in 1984. Overseas, Jacobs was visiting professor at [[Temple University]] ([[Philadelphia]]) in 1970 and 1971, at [[McMaster University]] ([[Hamilton, Ontario]]) in 1975 and 1983, and at the [[University of Queensland]] ([[Brisbane]]) in 1985.&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; After the Queensland post ended, he retired to [[Oxford]], where he died at the age of 74.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

==Librettist and translator==
Jacobs wrote the libretto for [[Nicholas Maw]]'s 1964 opera, ''One Man Show'', based on a short story by [[Saki]].&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; His colleague [[Stanley Sadie]] said of him, "Opera was always at the centre of his interests. He was a firm believer that it was meant to be fully understood, and that meant it should be presented in English to English-speaking audiences. He was a good linguist himself and translated more than 20 operas … in a fluent and direct style that sometimes betrayed (though not often inaptly) his early love of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]."&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; He made English translations of German, Italian, French and Russian opera libretti, including [[Alban Berg|Berg]]'s ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', [[Berlioz]]'s, ''[[Benvenuto Cellini (opera)|Benvenuto Cellini]]'', [[Donizetti]]'s, ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'', [[Gluck]]'s ''[[Iphigenie en Aulide]]'', [[Handel]]'s ''[[Riccardo Primo]]'', [[Monteverdi]]'s, ''[[L'Incoronazione di Poppea]]'', [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Die schweigsame Frau]]'', [[Rossini]]'s ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', ''[[L'italiana in Algeri]]'', and ''[[Il Turco in Italia]]'', [[Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Erwartung]]'', [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'',&lt;ref name=gale/&gt; and [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Don Carlos]]''.&lt;ref name=mt&gt;Jacobs, Arthur. "On Translating Opera",''The Musical Times'', January 1961, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Musical Times]]'' in 1961, Jacobs gave examples of stilted translations and contrasted them with vital and natural-sounding ones. He instanced a line from ''[[Tosca]]'', "Ah, finalmente! Nel terror mio stolto/ Vedea ceffi di birro in ogni volto!", gave a literal translation ("Ah! at last! In my stupid terror I saw those ugly police snouts in every face") and contrasted it with the original early-20th-century English translation: "Ah! I have baulked them! Dread imagination/ Made me quake with uncalled for perturbation."&lt;ref name=mt/&gt;

[[File:Lennons by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]]]]
'''Bagism''' is a satire of prejudice, where by living in a bag a person could not be judged on their bodily appearance. Bagism was created by [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] as part of their extensive peace campaign in the late 1960s. The intent of bagism was to satirize [[prejudice]] and [[stereotype|stereotyping]]. Bagism involved literally wearing a bag over one's entire body. According to John and Yoko, by living in a bag, a person could not be judged by others on the basis of skin colour, gender, hair length, attire, age, or any other such attributes. It was presented as a form of total [[communication]]: instead of focusing on outward [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], the listener would hear only the bagist's [[message]].

== Purpose and origins ==

John and Yoko introduced the idea during a well-received [[press conference]] in [[Vienna]] on 31 March 1969,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1969.0331.beatles.html "John Lennon &amp; Yoko Ono: Bagism Press Conference 3/31/1969"], The Beatles Ultimate Experience.&lt;/ref&gt; and explained it more thoroughly in a 14 June 1969 interview with [[David Frost]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beatlesbible.com/1969/06/14/television-john-lennon-yoko-ono-david-frost-show/ "Television: John Lennon and Yoko Ono on The David Frost Show"], The Beatles' Bible.&lt;/ref&gt; Bagism reflected the whimsical, carefree, and often [[comedy|comedic]] mood of John and Yoko's other peace efforts, such as their [[Bed-In]]s. By catching the attention of the masses with its outlandish premise, bagism presented a powerful social and [[politics|political]] message to the world. As Lennon stated, "Yoko and I are quite willing to be the world's [[clowns]]; if by doing it we do some good."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iiRkfZ-UwE "John Lennon - Bagism"] Excerpt from the documentary ''Imagine: John Lennon'', (1988), YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoko said that bagism was inspired by the theme of [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]'s ''[[The Little Prince]]'', which was "One sees rightly only with the heart, the essential is invisible to the eyes."  She hoped that the bag (by hiding her and John's physical appearance) would make their essence, or the essence of their message, visible.

== The Alchemical Wedding ==

The couple had earlier appeared in a bag, at The Alchemical Wedding, an underground artists' gathering, at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] in late 1968.  The event was put on by the [[Arts Lab]] and [[BIT (infoshop)]], which sought to challenge audiences to be participants rather than passive [[consumer]]s.  John and Yoko climbed into a large white bag on stage, sat cross-legged, knee-to-knee, hunkered down and closed the bag.  They moved only twice in 45 minutes, hunkering further down.  This was a strong challenge to the audience.

"Musicians played, poets ranted, and John and Yoko crept into their white sheet-like bag on the stage and stayed there out of sight for what seemed like ages. I watched a baby crawl slowly by. And that was the bag happening. All mayhem broke out when a young female member of the audience stripped off her clothes and danced in naked delight. When the police were called and attendants tried to remove her, groups of people started stripping off their clothes in solidarity. There was a retreat and a truce was worked out, and no-one was arrested. The nude girl incident, with accompanying photo, made the front pages of the London evening papers." As [[Lee Harris (South African artist)|Lee Harris]] noted later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeharris.co.uk/LeeHarris/Works/afootsol.htm Lee Harris' involvement with the Arts Lab and Alchemical Wedding]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bagism in the songs of John Lennon ==

Bagism is mentioned three times in the songs of John Lennon.  The first time is in "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]" where John refers to "eating chocolate cake in a bag", which was at the Vienna press conference, and the second is in the song "[[Come Together]]", where he sings: "He bag production".  This is a reference to Bag Productions Ltd, Lennon's public relations company, which derived its name from Bagism.  The third reference is in "[[Give Peace a Chance]]", with the line, "Everybody's talkin' about Bagism, Shagism, dragism, Madism, Ragism, Tagism, This-ism, That-ism, ism, ism, ism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hertzberg |first=Hendrik |date=5 July 2010 |title=Give John a Chance |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/hendrik-hertzberg/give-john-a-chance |publisher=''[[The New Yorker]]'' |access-date=30 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet following ==

A [[website]] called [http://www.bagism.com/ Bagism] was created c. 1994 by Sam Choukri, providing John Lennon and Beatles links, photographs, rare [[sound recording]] snippets and [[video]]. At one point, c. 1996, the precursor to Bagism.com, a website focused on Lennon, was sent a [[cease and desist]] request from the representatives of his estate over copyrighted John Lennon content. After an unsuccessful [http://www.bagism.com/library/cease-n-desist/letter-to-yoko.html appeal] to Ono and the John Lennon Estate and the [http://www.bagism.com/library/cease-n-desist/dear-yoko.html Dear Yoko] [[petition]] campaign, Choukri decided to focus his efforts on less legally volatile content and the website has since been a hub for [[discussion]], detailed [[discography|discographies]], letters, [[article (publishing)|article]]s, [[fan (person)|fan]] [[Work of art|artwork]] and [[poetry]], and many other types of content.

== Recent uses ==
[[Image:Liverpool John Lennon Airport-2006-09-28.jpg|thumb|150px|John Lennon Airport, September 2006]]
In 2006, [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]] had the words "Bagism, Shagism, Dragism, Madism, Ragism, Tagism" stickered along the front windows of the airport. This was done along with the branding of various John Lennon lyrics around the inside of the airport.

In 2010, the studio band Strawberry Walrus recorded a song entitled "Bagism" and released it on their album ''This Is Not Here''.

'''Border art''' is a [[contemporary art]] practice rooted in the socio-political experience(s) of those on the [[Mexico–United States border|U.S.-Mexico borderlands]], or ''frontera''. Since its conception in the mid-80s, this artistic practice has led to the development of questions surrounding [[homeland]], [[border]]s, [[surveillance]], identity, [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], and [[Nationality|national origin]](s).

Border art as a [[Conceptual art|conceptual artistic practice]], however, opens up the possibility for artists to explore similar concerns of identity and national origin(s) but whose location is not specific to the U.S-México border.

Border art can be defined as an art that is created in reference to any number of physical or imagined boundaries. This art can but is not limited to [[social]], [[Politics|political]], physical, [[emotion]]al and/or [[Nationalism|nationalist]] issues. Border art is not confined to one particular [[List of art media|medium]]. Border art/artists often address the forced politicization of human bodies and physical land and the arbitrary, yet incredibly harmful, separations that are created by these borders and boundaries. These artists are often "border crossers" themselves. They may cross borders of traditional art-making (through performance, video, or a combination of mediums). They may at once be artists and [[Activism|activists]], existing in multiple social [[role]]s at once. Many border artists defy easy classifications in their artistic practice and work.

A border can be a division, dividing groups of people and families. People can tell their stories through art.

==History of border art specific to the U.S.-Mexico border==

Ila Nicole Sheren states, "''Border Art didn't become a category until the Border Art Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo (BAW/TAF). Starting in 1984, and continuing in several iterations through the early twenty-first century, the binational collective transformed San Diego-Tijuana into a highly charged site for conceptual performance art ...The BAW/TAF artists were to link performance, site-specificity, and the U.S.-Mexico Border, as well as the first to'' ''export'' ''"border art" to other geographic locations and situations.''"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Portable Borders: Performance Art and Politics on the U.S. Frontera since 1984|last = Sheren|first = Ila|publisher = University of Texas Press|year = 2015|isbn = |location = Austin|pages = 23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A proponent of Border Art is Guillermo Gómez-Peña, founder of The Border Arts Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice. Ed. Gary L. Anderson and Kathryn G. Herr. Vol. 2. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Reference, 2007. p627-628.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Border Arts Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo pioneered tackling the political tensions of the borderlands, at a time when the region was gaining increased attention from the media due to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] debates.  The contradiction of the border opening to the free flow of capital but simultaneously closing to the flow of immigrants provided the opportunity to address other long-existing conflicts within the region.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prieto|first1=Antonio|title=Border Art as a Political Strategy|url=http://isla.igc.org/Features/Border/mex6.html|website=Information Services Latin America|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonio Prieto argues that "''As opposed to folk artists, the new generation belongs to the middle class, has formal training and self-consciously conceives itself as producer of 'border art.' Moreover, their art is politically charged, and assumes a confrontational stance vis-à-vis both Mexican and U.S. government policies.''"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Prieto notes that “''While the first examples of [[Chicano]] art in the late sixties took up issues of land, community and [[oppression]], it was not until later that graphic artists like Rupert García began to explicitly depict the border in their work. García's 1973 silkscreen "¡Cesen Deportación!," for example, calls for an end to the exploitative treatment of [[migrant worker]]s who are allowed to cross the border and are then deported at the whim of U.S. economic and political interests.''”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Prieto notes that for Mexican and Chicano artists, the aesthetics of ''[[Rasquache|rascuache]]'' created a hybridization of both Mexican and American visual culture. While it does not have an equivalent English translation, the term, ''rascuache'', can be likened to the artistic term, [[kitsch]]. It literally translates from [http://dictionary.reverso.net/spanish-english/rascuache Spanish] as "penniless", "worthless", and "in bad taste" with this latter definition closest to the English term, kitsch.

Photographer David Taylor focused on the U.S.-Mexico border by following monuments which mark the official borders of The United States and México outlined as a result of the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. He quotes on his [http://www.dtaylorphoto.com/ website], “''My travels along the border have been done both alone and in the company of agents. In total, the resulting pictures are intended to offer a view into locations and situations that we generally do not access and portray a highly complex physical, social and political topography during a period of dramatic change.''” In his project, Taylor has covered physical borders by documenting the environment and landscape along the border, but also addresses social issues by engaging with locals, patrolman, smugglers, and many other people living in and being affected by the U.S.-México border. He also chooses to address political issues by focusing on the large issue of [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = David Taylor|url = http://www.dtaylorphoto.com/portfolio.cfm?nK=4418&amp;nS=0#0|website = www.dtaylorphoto.com|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptual border(s) ==
Borders can also be [[concept]]ual. For example, borders between classes of people or races. [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldúa]]’s conceptualization of borders goes beyond national borders.  Anzaldúa  states: "The U.S.-Mexican border es una herida abierta where the Third World grates against the first and bleeds. And before a scab forms it hemorrhages again, the lifeblood of two worlds merging to form a third country - a border culture." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anzaldúa|first1=Gloria|title=Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza|date=1987|publisher=Aunt Lute Books|location=San Francisco|page=25|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza|Borderlands]]. Border artists include [[Ana Mendieta]], [[Guillermo Gómez-Peña]], [[Coco Fusco]], and [[Mona Hatoum]].

Prieto notes that “''This double task --being critical while at the same time proposing a utopian borderless future-- was undertaken with the tools of conceptual art.''”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Conceptual art]] was a European [[avant-garde]] artistic practice which focused on the intellectual development of an artwork rather than art as object.

Sheren additionally echoes that “''‘Border’ began to refer to a variety of non-physical boundaries: those between cultural or belief systems, those separating the colonial and the postcolonial, and even those demarcating various kinds of subjects.''”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this way, borders transcend physicality and become ‘portable’.

[[Trinh T. Minh-ha]] additionally observes “''boundaries not only express the desire to free/to subject one practice, one culture, one national community from/to another, but also expose the extent to which cultures are products of the continuing struggle between official and unofficial narratives–those largely circulated in favor of the State and its policies of inclusion, incorporation and validation, as well as of exclusion, appropriation and dispossession.''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = elsewhere, within here immigration, refugeeism and the boundary event|last = Minh-ha|first = Trinh T.|publisher = Routledge|year = 2011|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bureau International des Expositions''' ('''BIE''') is an intergovernmental organization created to supervise international exhibitions (also known as expos or [[world expo]]s) falling under the jurisdiction of the ''Convention Relating to International Exhibitions''.

==Founding and purpose==
The BIE was established by the Convention Relating to International Exhibitions, signed in [[Paris]] on 22 November 1928, with the following goals:
*to oversee the calendar, the bidding, the selection and the organization of World Expositions; and
*to establish a regulatory framework under which Expo organizers and participants may work together under the best conditions.

Today, 170 member countries have adhered to the BIE Convention.

The BIE regulates two types of expositions: Registered Exhibitions (commonly called World Expos) and Recognized Exhibitions (commonly called Specialized Expositions). Horticultural Exhibitions with an A1 grade, regulated by the [[AIPH|International Association of Horticultural Producers]], are recognized since 1960.

The Bureau International des Expositions also recognises the [[Triennale|Milan Triennial Exhibition of Decorative Arts and Modern Architecture]], on grounds of historical precedence, provided that it retains its original features.

==Expo Categories==
===History===
Since the creation of the BIE in 1928, different protocols have governed Expo categories, which are generally split between World Expos and Specialised Expos. The rules for each category define the duration, the frequency, the size, and the construction attributes of each Expo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/bie/our-history&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the original protocol of the 1928 Paris Convention, the BIE recognised two types of Expos:

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
* General Exhibitions (also known as World Expos), which were divided into:
(a) 1st category
(b) 2nd category 
* Special Exhibitions (also known as Specialised Expos)
{{col-end}}

The Protocol of 30 November 1972 revised the original Convention, entering into force in 1980. Under these new rules, two types of Expos were recognised:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
* World Exhibitions (also known as World Expos)
* Specialised Exhibitions (also known as Specialised Expos)
{{col-end}}

A new amendment was adopted in 1988 and ratified in 1996, further distinguishing the two types of Expos:
{{col-begin|width=auto}}
* International Registered Exhibitions (commonly referred to as World Expos)
* International Recognised Exhibitions (commonly referred to as Specialised Expos)
{{col-end}}

[[Expo 2008]] [[Zaragoza]] was the first Specialised Expo to be organised under these new rules, which continue to be in force to this day.

The BIE may also grant recognition to A1 Horticultural Exhibitions approved by the [[International Association of Horticultural Producers]] (AIPH) since 1960, and to the [[Triennale di Milano]] since 1933.

===World Expos ===
According to the 1988 Amendment of the Convention on International Exhibitions, World Expos (formally known as International Registered Exhibitions) may occur every five years, and may last up to six months.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/expos/about-expos/expo-categories&lt;/ref&gt; Countries, international organizations, civil societies, and corporations are allowed to participate in World Expos.  The themes of World Expos address a universal challenge facing humanity, and international participants may design and build their own pavilions. Participants may also opt to customise a pavilion provided by the Organiser or to participate within a joint pavilion, which has lower participation costs. Examples of themes of recent World Expos include "Man and His World" for [[Expo '67]] in [[Montreal]], and "Discovery" for [[Seville Expo '92]], and examples of joint pavilion buildings for a Registered Exposition is the Plaza of America at Seville's Expo '92, which was constructed by the Seville Expo Authority to maximize participation at the fair by South American nations. The Plaza of Africa at Seville was constructed for the same purpose.

World Expos are also massive in scale, sometimes 300 or 400 hectares in size (Montreal's Expo 67 was 410 hectares, Osaka's [[Expo 70]] was 330 hectares, Seville's [[Seville Expo '92|Expo '92]] was 215 hectares and Shanghai's [[Expo 2010]], 528 hectares). Pavilions participating at a World Expo can also be large, sometimes 5,000 to 10,000 square metres in size, mini city blocks in themselves and sometimes more than several stories in height. (The Australia Pavilion for Shanghai 2010 was 5,000 square metres, the British Pavilion sat on a 6,000 square metres lot, as did the Canadian Pavilion. The flagship Chinese National Pavilion had 20,000 square metres of exhibition space.)

World Expos have been known to average 200,000 persons per day of visitors - or more - and some 50 to 70 million visitors during their six-month duration. Montreal's Expo 67 attracted 54 million visitors, [[Osaka]]'s [[Expo '70]], 64 million visitors, the Seville Expo '92, 41 million visitors and Shanghai's Expo 2010 attracted 70 million visitors.

As a result, transport and other infrastructure at a Registered Exposition is an important concern (Seville's World Expo of 1992 boasted [[Gondola lift|cable car]], [[monorail]], boat, and bus) and the overall cost for hosting and being represented at a World Expos is quite high, compared to the smaller-scale Specialised Expos.

===Specialised Expos ===
Specialised Expos (formally known as International Recognised Exhibitions) may occur between World Expos and may have a duration of between three weeks and three months. Countries, international organizations, civil societies, and corporations are allowed to participate but the theme of the Expo must address a precise challenge, e.g. Future Energy ([[Expo 2017]] Astana), or Living Oceans and the Coast ([[Expo 2012]] Yeosu). The pavilions are built by the Organiser and made available to participants who may customise them. The largest pavilion may be no larger than 1,000 square meters, and the Expo site must not exceed an area of twenty-five hectares. For this reason Specialised Expos are cheaper to run than World Expos.

==Member states==
170 countries are member states of the BIE:&lt;ref name=members&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/the-member-states-of-the-bie|title=The Member States|website=www.bie-paris.org|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former members===

====Australia====
[[Australia]] was a signatory to the treaty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1973/34.html|title=Agreement concerning the Voluntary Contributions to be Given for the Execution of the Project to Preserve Borobudur [1973] ATS 34|website=www3.austlii.edu.au|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the right to hold the [[World Expo 88|1988 World Exposition]].  In 2015 the [[Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry]] requested that the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)]] reconsider membership, as the cost was too high and "difficult to demonstrate an appropriate return on investment", and that membership be withdrawn temporarily in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://13-acci.cdn.aspedia.net/sites/default/files/uploaded-content/field_f_content_file/acci-submission-to-dfat_bie-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Australia is no longer listed as a member of BIE.&lt;ref name=members /&gt;

====Canada====
On October 16, 2012, the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative government]] ended Canada's membership of the BIE when the federal government cancelled its $25,000 per year membership fee as part of “reviewing all spending across government with the aim of reducing the deficit and returning to balanced budgets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Toronto’s World Expo 2025 bid dead after Prime Minister Stephen Harper government says no |author= |first= David |last= Rider |url= https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2012/10/23/torontos_world_expo_2025_bid_dead_after_prime_minister_stephen_harper_government_says_no.html |agency= |newspaper= The Star |publisher= |location= [[Toronto]] |date= April 29, 2012 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate= April 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejoined Members===

====United States (non member from 2001-17)====
Five world's fair events have been sanctioned by the BIE in the United States since World War II: one in the World Expo category - the [[Century 21 Exposition]] in [[Seattle]] (1962) - and four in the Specialized Expo category - [[HemisFair '68]] in [[San Antonio]], [[Expo '74]] in [[Spokane, Washington]], the [[1982 World's Fair]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] and the [[1984 Louisiana World Exposition]] in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name="biehome"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/home/history-of-expos|accessdate=2014-05-15|title=Expo Details}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The United States' membership in the BIE was revoked in June 2001&lt;ref&gt;https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/9708/Opening%20the%20X-Files-%20A%20Case%20for%20Rejoining%20the%20BIE.pdf%3Bsequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; due to non-allocation of funds by the [[U.S. Congress]] for two years. The withdrawal of the United States from the BIE had a limited impact on the BIE and on the participation of the United States in world's fairs: the country hosted pavilions at Specialised [[Expo 2005]] in [[Aichi Prefecture]], [[Japan]], World [[Expo 2010]] in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], Specialised [[Expo 2012]] in [[Yeosu]], [[South Korea]], and World [[Expo 2015]] in [[Milan]], [[Italy]].  However, the withdrawal "had strong, adverse consequences for states and localities that wish to host an exposition on U.S. soil. Organizers in at least four states have prepared bids, or are exploring the possibility of preparing bids to host a BIE-affiliated expo." In each case, the bid project was unsuccessful, with non-membership of the BIE hurting the chances of a U.S. bid moving forward. &lt;ref&gt;https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/9708/Opening%20the%20X-Files-%20A%20Case%20for%20Rejoining%20the%20BIE.pdf%3Bsequence=1&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. rejoined the organization on 10 May 2017&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/news-announcements/bie-activity/the-united-states-becomes-the-170th-member-state-of-the-bie&lt;/ref&gt; after President Trump signed the "U.S. Wants to Compete for a World Expo Act" (HR534) into law (Pub.L. 115-32)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/534&lt;/ref&gt; as Minnesota was looking to host a Specialized Expo in 2023.

== Publication history ==

Coleridge originally had no intention of making his notebooks public, but in his later years he came to think of them as a legacy to be passed down to his disciples. He even allowed his friend [[Robert Southey]] to use a number of extracts in their collaborative work ''Omniana'', published in 1812 and reprinted in an expanded form in 1836. In 1895 the poet's grandson [[Ernest Hartley Coleridge]] released a larger selection under the title ''Anima Poetæ'', and the following year the scholar Alois Brandl published in Germany an edition of the first notebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cheshire |first1=Paul |editor1-first=Frederick |editor1-last=Burwick |title=The Oxford Handbook of Samuel Taylor Coleridge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K8cLTvMdO7YC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=%22developing+into+a+legacy%22&amp;hl=en |accessdate=20 November 2012 |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199229536 |pages=292, 296 |chapter=Coleridge's ''Notebooks'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Southey |first1=Robert |last2=Coleridge |first2=S.

Coburn began work on this in the 1930s; the first volume appeared in 1957, and the fifth and final one (completed by Anthony John Harding) in 2002, 11 years after her death.

The [[Çankaya Köşkü]] Presidential Palace in 1935 ''(right)'', the official and current residence of the Prime Minister of Turkey, was originally the Kasabian Estate and belonged to an Armenian named Ohannes Kasabian, who escaped the Armenian Genocide.{{sfn|Ruggles|2012|p=174}}&lt;ref name="hurriyet.com.tr"&gt;{{tr icon}} Yalçın, Soner.

The '''[[confiscation]] of Armenian properties''' by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Turkey|Turkish]] governments involved seizure of the assets, properties and land of the country's [[Turkish Armenians|Armenian community]]. Starting with the [[Hamidian massacres]] in the mid-1890s and peaking during the [[Armenian Genocide]], the confiscation of the Armenian property lasted continuously until the [[Istanbul pogrom]] of 1955 and with renewed efforts in 1974.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=11|ps=: "[[Sait Çetinoglu]] has placed the expropriation of Armenians during the 1915 genocide in a much wider historical context. He argues that from the prism of the longue durée, the period 1895–1955 brought a complete obliteration to the economic life of Ottoman Armenians. This process moved from the 1895 Abdulhamid massacres to the Adana massacre, reached a zenith with the genocide and ultimately in the burning of Smyrna, continued in peacetime during the interwar discriminations, accelerated during the Wealth Tax launched during World War II, and found a conclusion in the 6–7 September 1955 pogrom. Within only sixty years, Ottoman Armenians had been eradicated–economically and in many other ways."}} Much of the confiscations during the Armenian Genocide were made after the Armenians were deported into the [[Syrian Desert]] with the government declaring their goods and assets left behind as "abandoned". Virtually all properties owned by Armenians living in their ancestral homeland in [[Western Armenia]]  were confiscated and later distributed among the local Muslim population. Renewed efforts were introduced in 1974 where the property acquired by the Armenian community after the property declaration of 1936 was confiscated.

Historians argue that the mass confiscation of Armenian properties was an important factor in forming the economic basis of the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]] while endowing Turkey's economy with [[capital (economics)|capital]]. The appropriation led to the formation of a new Turkish [[bourgeoisie]] and an exclusive middle class.

{{double image|right|AbandonedPropertiesReceipt.jpg|155|AbandonedPropertiesReceipt1.jpg|150|The Abandoned Properties Administration Commissions created registries that were specifically designated to record the names of the owners and the types of goods and assets they owned while providing assurances that the goods were to be available once the deportees reached their destination.&lt;ref name=matossian /&gt;{{#tag:ref|Registers of the liquidation commissions are accessed through 'Emval-i Metrûke Tasfiye Komisyonlarının Esas Defteri,' in [[Takvim-i Vekayi]], 28 Teşrinievvel 1331, #2343.

=== Confiscation as part of the Armenian Genocide ===
On 16 May 1915, while the [[Armenian Genocide]] was underway, a secret directive was promulgated entitled "administrative instruction regarding movable and immovable property abandoned by Armenians deported as a result of the war and unusual political circumstances."{{sfn|Toriguian|1988|p=85}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Armenian Genocide: Facts and Documents|year=1985|publisher=St. Vartan Press|location=New York City|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Armenian Review|year=1965|volume=18|page=3|publisher=Hairenik Association|quote=Articles 2, 3, 6, 11 and 22 of the governmental order of May 16, 1915, from Talaat, head of the Ministry of Interior, in Constantinople directing the seizure and confiscation of Armenian buildings apply, also, to church buildings and their property.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=acemoglu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acemoglu|first=Murat|title=The Consequences of the Events of 1915–1923: Destruction of the Populace and Monuments, Confiscation of Abandoned Properties and Assimilation of the Orphans|journal=Armenian Reporter|date=18 November 2000|volume=34|issue=7|page=3|location=Paramus, New Jersey|issn=1074-1453}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Turkish: 'Harb ve Olağanüstü Siyasi Durum Sebebiyle Başka Yerlere Gönderilen Ermenilere Ait Mülk ve Arâzînin İdâre Şekli Hakkında Talimât-nâme.' 27 Recep 1333 and 28 May 1331 (10 June 1915). The 34 articles of the law are reproduced in Prime Ministry Directorate General of Press and Information, Documents,vol. 1, Ankara, 1982, pp.&amp;nbsp;6–80.|group="n"}} Once enacted, the directive established special commissions, known as the "Abandoned Property Commissions" (Turkish: Emvâl-i Metrûke İdare Komisyonları) and the "Liquidation Commissions" (Turkish: Tasfiye Komisyonu), which were tasked with providing detailed information and appraising the value of assets "abandoned" by deportees under the guise of "safeguarding" them.{{sfn|Toriguian|1988|p=85}}&lt;ref name=matossian /&gt;&lt;ref name=kouymjian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kouymjian|first=Dickran|title=The Crime Against Cultural Heritage and Historical Memory: The Question of Abandoned Property|journal=The Crime of Genocide: Prevention, Condemnation and Elimination of Consequences|date=December 2011|pages=178–186|url=http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/faculty/kouymjian/articles/2011%20Kouymjian-Genocide%20article.pdf|authorlink=Dickran Kouymjian|editor1-first=Aram|editor1-last=Harutyunyan|publisher=Foreign Ministry of Armenia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of these commissions rose to 33 by January 1916.&lt;ref name="Revisiting the Turkification of Confiscated Armenian Assets" /&gt; After the departure of the deportees, goods and livestock that were deemed "perishable" were prioritized as the first items that must be sold using public auctions, while the profits from these auctions were to be safeguarded under the entitlement of the owners.{{sfn|Toriguian|1988|p=85}} After providing documentation of the property (copies provided to the owners and the Ottoman Treasury), the directive specified that ''[[Muhacir|muhajirs]]'' (Turkish refugees mainly from the [[Balkan wars]]) were to be settled in the vacant lands and properties belonging to the deportees.{{sfn|Toriguian|1988|p=85}}&lt;ref name=kouymjian /&gt; Once settled, the refugees had to register the land and houses, while other assets that were affixed to the property, such as olive groves and vineyards, were to be allocated amongst them. Unwanted items and assets were to be sold in public auctions.{{sfn|Toriguian|1988|p=85}} According to historian [[Dickran Kouymjian]], the settlement of ''muhajirs'' into the lands and properties of deported Armenians implies that local authorities had firsthand knowledge that the deportees were to never return.&lt;ref name=kouymjian /&gt;

On 29 May 1915, the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP) Central Committee passed the [[Tehcir Law]] authorizing the deportation of "persons judged to be a threat to national security."{{sfn|Balakian|2003|pp=186–8}} The Tehcir Law emphasized that the deportees must not sell their assets, but instead provide a detailed list and submit the list to the local authorities:
{{quotation|Leave all your belongings—your furniture, your beddings, your artifacts. Close your shops and businesses with everything inside. Your doors will be sealed with special stamps. On your return, you will get everything you left behind. Do not sell property or any expensive item. Buyers and sellers alike will be liable for legal action. Put your money in a bank in the name of a relative who is out of the country. Make a list of everything you own, including livestock, and give it to the specified official so that all your things can be returned to you later. You have ten days to comply with this ultimatum.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=69}}}}

{{double image|right|OrientAbandonedProperties 02.png|135|OrientAbandonedProperties_01.png|170|The "Temporary Law of Expropriation and Confiscation" was published in many newspapers throughout the Ottoman Empire. Above is an example of one such publication, a 23 October 1915 issue of the English language Turkish newspaper ''[[The Orient (newspaper)|The Orient]]'', which fully published the law with all eleven articles. [[Arthur von Gwinner]], head of the [[Deutsche Bank]], mocked the law by saying that the eleven articles should be reduced to two, "1. All goods of the Armenians are confiscated. 2. The government will cash in the credits of the deportees and will repay (or will not repay) their debts."{{sfn|Balakian|2003|p=187}}{{sfn|Dadrian|1995|p=222}} Others, such as legal experts and foreign diplomats, have called it "legalization of pillage".{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=46}}}}

While the Tehcir law was being carried out, the Directorate for the Settlement of Tribes and Refugees (Turkish: Iskan-i Asairin Muhacirin Muduriyeti), under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, was tasked in June 1915 to deal with the property left behind by deported or killed Armenians. This commission, whose salaries were provided by property confiscated by Armenians, produced the "Temporary Law of Expropriation and Confiscation ("Abandoned Properties" law) and published in the official register on 27 September (13 September according to the Islamic calendar) and passed a further directive for implementation of the law on 8 November.&lt;ref name=anastasia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lekka|first=Anastasia|title=Legislative Provisions of the Ottoman/Turkish Governments Regarding Minorities and Their Properties|journal=Mediterranean Quarterly|date=Winter 2007|volume=18|issue=1|pages=135–154|issn=1047-4552|doi=10.1215/10474552-2006-038}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kevorkian|2010|p=204}}{{sfn|Akçam|2012|p=351}} The objectives of the laws were simultaneously to reduce Armenian property ownership, enrich national politicians, and to resettle Turkish Muslim refugees in property which was seized.&lt;ref name=anastasia /&gt;{{sfn|Kevorkian|2010|p=204}} The property confiscated included personal property (including land, buildings, and bank accounts), businesses, and also community property (e.g. churches). Items that were considered useful for the immediacy of the war effort were prioritized and immediately confiscated with a separate decree.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=84}} Under the law, property and asset transactions were forbidden prior to the deportation thereby preventing the owners from having the opportunity to keep his or her property.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=46}} Although the law was called "Temporary", the provisions within it seemed to aim toward the permanent transformation of the ethnicity of communities from Armenian to Turkish Muslim.{{sfn|Kevorkian|2010|pp=204–205}}

These resettlement laws did contain formal reporting of property to national authorities and contained procedures for those who had property taken to sue, but the specifics of the law made these provisions serve the larger goal to "[[Turkification|Turkify]]" regions and economic sectors.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=79}}{{sfn|Kevorkian|2010|pp=204–205}} The property records and revenue generated from the sale or rent of confiscated property were all recorded and deposited with the Ministry of Financial Affairs to provide for the possible return of property to owners.&lt;ref name=anastasia /&gt; In addition, the law provided that those whose property had been confiscated to sue for return of the property (and payment for any damages which occurred). However, the law required property owners to sue and be present themselves (not allowing the [[power of attorney]]), an impossibility when property owners had been killed or deported. In addition, the defendant in any case would be the state which made the chances of success in any lawsuit extremely unlikely.&lt;ref name=anastasia /&gt; Finally, the law provided that the confiscated property be sold at auction; however, because the law specified that "anybody other than Turkish Muslim refugees can only acquire property in Turkey with the approval of the Ministry of Internal Affairs", the result was that non-Turkish Muslims were effectively excluded.&lt;ref name=anastasia /&gt; Property was provided often to national and local political elites, who eventually gave them to Turkish Muslim refugees.{{sfn|Kevorkian|2010|pp=205}}

| quote  = All the properties of the Armenians were confiscated, nominally to the state for the war fund. In this way all the Armenian houses, stores, shops, fields, gardens, vineyards, merchandise, household goods, rugs, were taken. The work was the charge of a commission, the members of which I met personally a number of times. It was commonly said that the commission did not actually receive enough for the government purposes to cover its expenses. Real estate was put up for rent at auction and was most of it bid in at prices ridiculously low by persons who were on the inside. This I know not only as a matter of common information but directly from a Turkish attorney who was in our employ and who provided himself with one of the best Armenian houses. Turks moved out of their more squalid habitations into the better Armenian houses whose owners had been 'deported.' All the property of the Armenians except some remnants left to the Armenians who had embraced Mohammedanism was thus plundered.

The impact of these laws were immediate. According to a report in June 1916 by the German ambassador stationed in Constantinople, the goods of the Armenians "have long since been confiscated, and their capital has been liquidated by a so-called commission, which means that if an Armenian owned a house valued at, say, £T100, a Turk – a friend or member [of the Ittihad and Terakki] – could have it for around £T2."{{sfn|Marashlian|1999|p=115}}

The only notable domestic opposition was by Ottoman parliamentary representative [[Ahmed Riza]], who stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is unlawful to designate the Armenian assets as "abandoned goods" for the Armenians, the proprietors, did not abandon their properties voluntarily; they were forcibly, compulsorily removed from their domiciles and exiled. Now the government through its efforts is selling their goods&amp;nbsp;... Nobody can sell my property if I am unwilling to sell it. Article 21 of the [[Constitution of the Ottoman Empire|Constitution]] forbids it. If we are a constitutional regime functioning in accordance with constitutional law we can't do this. This is atrocious. Grab my arm, eject me from my village, then sell my goods and properties, such a thing can never be permissible. Neither the conscience of the Ottomans nor the law can allow it.{{sfn|Balakian|2003|p=188}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Formal directives were made to have much of the properties and businesses confiscated from the Armenians to be transferred into the hands of Muslims. On 6 January 1916, [[Talaat Pasha]], the Interior Minister of the Ottoman Empire, decreed:
{{quotation|The movable property left by the Armenians should be conserved for long-term preservation, and for the sake of an increase of Muslim businesses in our country, companies need to be established strictly made up of Muslims. Movable property should be given to them under suitable conditions that will guarantee the business's steady consolidation. The founder, the management, and the representatives should be chosen from honorable leaders and the elite, and to allow tradesmen and agriculturists to participate in its dividends, the vouchers need to be half a lira or one lira and registered to their names to preclude that the capital falls in foreign hands. The growth of entrepreneurship in the minds of Muslim people needs to be monitored, and this endeavor and the results of its implementation need to be reported to the ministry step by step.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=79}}{{#tag:ref|Başbakanlık Osmanlı Arşivi (Ottoman Archives, Istanbul), DH.ŞFR 59/239, Interior Ministry to all provinces, 6 January 1916.|group="n"}} }}

In addition to churches and monasteries, other community owned properties confiscated were schools and educational facilities.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=70}} The Interior Ministry had ordered such educational facilities to be assigned to Muslims:
{{quotation|It is necessary to appropriate the schools of the towns and villages that have been emptied of Armenians to Muslim immigrants to be settled there.

Following the decree, private Armenian schools became Ottoman Turkish schools and school supplies were distributed to the Turkish Muslim population.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=70}} Abraham Harutiunian, a priest living in [[Süleymanlı|Zeitun]], notes in his memoirs that the school in Zeitun was confiscated by the government and that "the Armenians no longer had any right to education, and the campus was now filled with hundreds of Turkish children."{{sfn|Hartunian|1986|pp=68–69}}

By the early 1930s, all properties belonging to Armenians who were subject to deportation had been confiscated.{{sfn|Winter|2003|p=18}} Since then, no restitution of property confiscated during the Armenian Genocide has taken place.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=59}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AKP Founding Member Apologizes for 'Geno-Deportations'|url=http://asbarez.com/102610/akp-founding-member-apologizes-for-%E2%80%98geno-deportations%E2%80%99/|newspaper=Asbarez|date=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws concerning abandoned property remained in effect for 73 years until it was finally abolished on 11 June 1986.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=57}} The mass confiscation of properties provided the opportunity for ordinary lower class Turks (i.e. peasantry, soldiers, and laborers) to rise to the ranks of the middle class.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=80}} Contemporary Turkish historian [[Uğur Ümit Üngör]] asserts that "the elimination of the Armenian population left the state an infrastructure of Armenian property, which was used for the progress of Turkish (settler) communities.

====Extent of Ottoman confiscation====
Although the exact extent of confiscated property during the Armenian Genocide is unknown, according to [[Talaat Pasha]]'s private documents, the chief initiator of the [[Tehcir Law]],{{sfn|Akçam|2007|pp=186–7}} a total of 20,545 buildings were confiscated including 267,536 acres of land along with other parcels of agricultural and tillable lands such as 76,942 acres of vineyards, 703,941 acres of olive groves, and 4,573 acres of mulberry gardens.&lt;ref name=ungor1234&gt;{{cite journal|last=Üngör|first=Uğur Ümit|title=The Armenian Genocide: A Multi-Dimensional Process of Destruction|journal=Global Dialogue|date=Winter 2013|volume=15|issue=1|pages=97–106|publisher=Centre for World Dialogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=82}}

During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], the Armenian delegation presented an assessment of $3.7 billion (about ${{Inflation|US|3.7|1919|r=0|fmt=c}} billion today) worth of material losses owned solely by the Armenian church.&lt;ref name=avedian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avedian|first=Vahagn|title=State Identity, Continuity, and Responsibility: The Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Turkey and the Armenian Genocide|journal=European Journal of International Law|date=August 2012|volume=23|issue=3|pages=797–820|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United Kingdom|issn=0938-5428|doi=10.1093/ejil/chs056}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the conference in February 1920, the Armenian community presented an additional demand for the restitution of property and assets seized by the Ottoman government. The joint declaration, which was submitted to the Supreme Council by the Armenian delegation and prepared by the religious leaders of the Armenian community, claimed that the Ottoman government had destroyed 2,000 churches and 200 monasteries and had provided the legal system for giving these properties to other parties. The declaration also provided a financial assessment of the total losses of personal property and assets of both Turkish and Russian Armenia with 14,598,510,000 and 4,532,472,000 [[francs]] respectively; totaling to an estimated ${{Inflation|US|298|2008|r=0|fmt=c}} billion today.{{sfn|Baghdjian|2010|p=275}}{{sfn|Turabian|1962|pp=265-7}} Furthermore, the Armenian community asked for the restitution of church owned property and reimbursement of its generated income.{{sfn|Marashlian|1999|p=118}} The Ottoman government never responded to this declaration and so restitution did not occur.{{sfn|Marashlian|1999|p=118}}

The issue of confiscated Armenian property came about in a number of treaties signed between the [[First Republic of Armenia]] and the Ottoman Empire.  Both the [[Treaty of Batum]] (signed 4 June 1918) and the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (signed 10 August 1920) contained provisions related to the restitution for confiscated properties of Armenians.&lt;ref name=acemoglu /&gt; The Treaty of Sèvres under Article 144 specified that the Abandoned Property commissions and Liquidation commissions must be abolished and the laws of confiscation be annulled.&lt;ref name=kouymjian /&gt;{{sfn|Hovannisian|2008|p=35}} Meanwhile, however, those who seized the assets and properties of Armenians turned to support the Turkish national movement since the dissolution of the Ottoman government would mean that the properties and assets would be protected under their name.&lt;ref name="Revisiting the Turkification of Confiscated Armenian Assets" /&gt; Thus, on 8 May 1920, the first law promulgated by the newly established parliament was to pardon those charged of massacre and expropriation of property by the [[Turkish courts-martial of 1919-20]]. Furthermore, with the establishment of the Turkish republic and the signing of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (24 July 1923), the provisions of the Treaty of Sevres eventually never took effect and the liquidation committees involved with the confiscation of Armenian property resumed operations.&lt;ref name=acemoglu /&gt;&lt;ref name=kouymjian /&gt;
{{double image|right|Bankottomandeposit2.jpg|160|Bankottomandeposit1.jpg|160|Certificate of deposits made to the [[Kayseri]] branch of the Imperial Ottoman Bank belonging to Mrs. Arousse Parsek Pastirmadjian ''(left)'' and Mrs. Virginie, widow of Agop Pastirmadjian ''(right)''.{{sfn|Baghdjian|2010|p=276}} The banks also held valuable commodities which were permitted to be deposited as well. For example, Mrs. Arousse Parsek Pastirmadjian's certificate states that the bank holds as a deposit "one white tin plate box covered of linen - declared value TL 190."{{sfn|Baghdjian|2010|p=276}} Such certificates are still held by many survivors of the Armenian Genocide and their heirs today.{{sfn|Baghdjian|2010|p=277}}}}
In addition to confiscated property, large sums of money and precious metals belonging to Armenians were also seized and deposited into the treasuries of the Ottoman government or in various German or Austrian banks during the war. Such sums were believed to be withdrawn from the bank accounts of deported and killed Armenians.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=66}} An official memorandum prepared by former British Prime Ministers [[Stanley Baldwin]] and [[H. H. Asquith]] was sent to then Prime Minister of Great Britain [[Ramsay MacDonald]] describing such seizures and deposits:
{{quotation|The sum of 5,000,000 Turkish gold pounds (representing about 30.000 kilograms of gold) deposited by the Turkish government at the Reichsbank in Berlin in 1916, and taken over by the Allies after the Armistice, was in large part (perhaps wholly) Armenian money. After the forced deportation of the Armenians in 1915, their current and deposit accounts were transferred, by government order, to the State Treasury in Constantinople.{{sfn|Toriguian|1988|p=77}}}}

Much of the money deposits into banks and other financial institutions have also been subsequently seized in the immediate aftermath of the deportations. Once a deposit was made, a certificate was given to the depositor as a proof of deposit. However, once the deportations began, withdrawals were prohibited. Much of the deportees who had held deposits were left with only certificates in their possession. Many of the depositors still carry the certificates of deposit today. Historian Kevork Baghdjian states that the worth of these deposits "should rise to astronomical sums today," with the "deposited capital and interests combined."{{sfn|Baghdjian|2010|p=277}}

=== Confiscation during the Turkish Republic ===
[[File:EvictionofArmenian.jpg|thumbnail|An example of an eviction notice dated 1 January 1950 of an Armenian woman issued by the Internal Revenue Board and sent to the local Cadastral Directorate. Such evictions were assigned to special investigative committees that dealt solely with the properties of Armenians.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|pp=56–57}}]]
Following the [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the creation of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, the confiscation resumed with most Armenians having been deported or killed.&lt;ref name=matossian /&gt; During the early Republican era, the legal terminology was changed from "transported persons" to "persons who lost or fled from the country."&lt;ref name="Revisiting the Turkification of Confiscated Armenian Assets" /&gt;

On 15 April 1923, just before the signing of the  [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the Turkish government enacted the "Law of Abandoned Properties" which confiscated properties of any Armenian who was not present on their property, regardless of the circumstances of the reason. While local courts were authorized to appraise the value of any property and provide an avenue for property owners to make claims, the law prohibited the use of any [[power of attorney]] by absent property holders, preventing them from filing suit without returning to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Confiscation des biens des réfugiés arméniens par le gouvernement turc|year=1929|publisher=Le Fur|pages=87–90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZElAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=|author1=Gilbert Gidel |author2=Albert Geouffre de Lapradelle |author3=Louis Le Fur |author4=André Nicolayévitch Mandelstam |author5=Cómité des réfugiés arménins |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the defendant in the case would be the state of Turkey which had created specially tasked committees to deal with each case.&lt;ref name=anastasia /&gt;{{sfn|Baghdjian|2010|p=191}}

In addition to this law, the Turkish government continued revoking the citizenship of many people with a law on 23 May 1927 which stated that "Ottoman subjects who during the War of Independence took no part in the National movement, kept out of Turkey and did not return from 24 July 1923 to the date of the publication of this law, have forfeited Turkish nationality."&lt;ref name=matossian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Der Matossian|first=Bedross|title=The Taboo within the Taboo: The Fate of 'Armenian Capital' at the End of the Ottoman Empire|journal=European Journal of Turkish Studies|date=6 October 2011|url=http://ejts.revues.org/4411|ISSN=1773-0546}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Law No. 1042 of the Republic of Turkey, 23 May 1927|group="n"}} Additionally, a further law passed on 28 May 1928 stipulated that those who had lost their citizenship would be expelled from Turkey, not allowed to return, and that their property would be confiscated by the Turkish government, and Turkish migrants would be resettled in the properties.&lt;ref name=matossian /&gt; 
[[File:Vergisiauctions.png|thumb|left|Carpets of non-Muslims unable to pay the tax hike being sold at public auction during the [[Varlık Vergisi]].{{sfn|Sachar|2007|pp=79–80}} Such items were sold at a price significantly lower than actual worth in order to avoid forced labor and possible death in labor camps in eastern Turkey.{{sfn|Sachar|2007|pp=79–80}}]]
In the preparation for possible entry into [[World War II]], the Turkish government introduced a tax, the [[Varlık Vergisi]], which disproportionately targeted Turkey's non-Muslim residents. Many Armenians, and other non-Muslim populations, were forced to sell their property at significantly reduced prices through public auctions in order to pay for the sudden tax hike or have the properties confiscated by the state.{{sfn|Sachar|2007|pp=79–80}} In addition, the law allowed authorities to confiscate the property of any relative of a taxed person in order to pay the tax.{{sfn|Sachar|2007|pp=79–80}} From this tax, the Turkish government collected 314,900,000 [[Turkish lira|lira]]s or about US$270 million (80% of the state budget) from the confiscation of non-Muslim assets.&lt;ref name=bulent&gt;{{cite news|last=Günal|first=Bülent|title=Atatürk olsa Varlık Vergisi olmazdı|url=http://www.haberturk.com/polemik/haber/787272-ataturk-olsa-varlik-vergisi-olmazdi|newspaper=Haber Turk|date=21 October 2012|language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This period coincided with further confiscations of private property belonging to Armenians. Special commissions were created to separate the evictions of non-Muslims from others. The investigators of this commission usually expedited the evacuation and eventual confiscation of the non-Muslim property in question.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|pp=56-7}}

The Varlık Vergisi was followed by the [[Istanbul pogrom]] a few years later, where an organized [[Angry mob|mob]] attacked Greeks and Armenians on 6–7 September 1955. The material damage was considerable, with damage to 5317 properties (including 4214 homes, 1004 businesses, 73 churches, 2 monasteries, 1 synagogue, and 26 schools).&lt;ref name=guven1&gt;{{Cite news|last=Güven|first=Dilek|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/haber.php?haberno=163380|title=6–7 Eylül Olayları (1)|work=[[Radikal]]|date=9 September 2005|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the economic cost of the damage range from the Turkish government's estimate of 69.5 million [[Turkish lira]] (equivalent to 24.8 million [[USD|US$]]),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120208101850/http://www.ceterisparibus.net/veritabani/1923_1990/doviz.htm Turkish currency exchange rates 1923–1990]&lt;/ref&gt; the British estimate of 100 million [[GBP]] (about 200 million US$), the [[World Council of Churches]]' estimate of 150 million US$, and the Greek government's estimate of 500 million US$.{{sfn|Vryonis|2005|page=32}}&lt;ref name=aysehur&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.taraf.com.tr/yazilar/ayse-hur/6-7-eylulde-devletin-muhtesem-orgutlenmesi/1821/ |accessdate=2008-09-21 |title=6-7 Eylül'de devletin 'muhteşem örgütlenmesi' |work=[[Taraf]] |date=2008-09-07 |first=Ayşe |last=Hür |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911162900/http://www.taraf.com.tr/yazilar/ayse-hur/6-7-eylulde-devletin-muhtesem-orgutlenmesi/1821/ |archivedate=11 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pogrom eventually lead to an exodus of non-Muslims out of the country, resulting in a significant amount of "abandoned" properties.

[[File:1936surptateospchurchdeclaration.jpg|thumb|220px|In 1936, the Turkish government requested from minority foundations to provide a list of their owned assets and properties.

Although twenty-one of the properties belonging to the foundation were formally listed in the declaration, fourteen of them were eventually confiscated.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=303}}]]
In the 1960s, new laws were passed, which made it impossible for Armenians to establish new foundations nor to buy or bequeath additional properties. One such law code (Law no. 903) adopted in 1967, along with a second paragraph amended to the Turkish Civil Code (no. 743) declared that, "The registration of foundations that are in violation of law, morality, tradition or national interests, or that were established to support a political belief, a certain race or members of a minority will not be approved."{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=69}} Such laws are considered by legal experts as a violation of articles concerning minority rights found in the Treaty of Laussane, the Turkish constitution, and [[Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 11]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which grants the "freedom to establish foundations and hold meetings."{{sfn|Hatemi|Kurban|2009|p=28}} The new amendment and law code became the basis for a new series of confiscations that significantly obstructed the daily lives of Armenians in Turkey.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=69}}

In 1974 new legislation was passed that stated that non-Muslim trusts could not own more property than that which had been registered under their name in 1936.&lt;ref name="tuzlacamp"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bianet.org/haber_eski/haber659.htm | first=Yasemin | last=Varlık | title= Tuzla Ermeni Çocuk Kampı'nın İzleri | work=Bianet | date=2 July 2001|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061206120115/http://www.bianet.org/haber_eski/haber659.htm |archivedate = 6 December 2006|language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="agos070126"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bu kadarı da yapılmaz be Hrant! |last=Oran |first=Baskın |newspaper=[[Agos]] |date=26 January 2007 |url=http://www.ba.metu.edu.tr/~adil/baskin/345)Bu(26-01-2007).rtf |language=tr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301053239/http://www.ba.metu.edu.tr/~adil/baskin/345%29Bu%2826-01-2007%29.rtf |archivedate=1 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Peroomian|2008|p=277}}&lt;ref name="Turkey to return confiscated property"&gt;{{cite news|last=Susan|first=Fraser|title=Turkey to return confiscated property|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9819101|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, more than 1,400 assets (included churches, schools, residential buildings, hospitals, summer camps, cemeteries, and orphanages) of the Istanbul Armenian community since 1936 were retrospectively classified as illegal acquisitions and seized by the state.&lt;ref name="Revisiting the Turkification of Confiscated Armenian Assets"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bedrosyan|first=Raffi|title=Revisiting the Turkification of Confiscated Armenian Assets|url=http://www.armenianweekly.com/2012/04/17/revisiting-the-turkification-of-confiscated-armenian-assets/|newspaper=Armenian Weekly|date=17 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Peroomian|2008|p=277}}&lt;ref name=Bedrosyan1 /&gt; Under the legislation, the Turkish courts rendered Turkish citizens of non-Turkish descent as "foreigners", thereby placing them under the same legal regulations of any foreign company or property holder living outside of Turkey who was not a Turkish national.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=67}} The provisions further provided that foundations belonging to non-Muslims are a potential "threat" to national security.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=67}} The process involved returning any property acquired after 1936, whether through lottery, will, donation, or purchase, to their former owners or inheritors.

On 11 June 1986, the laws concerning "abandoned" properties during the Armenian Genocide were abrogated, which ended 73 years of effectiveness.{{sfn|Üngör|Polatel|2011|p=57}} Throughout the Republican period, the laws continued to provide a legal basis for the confiscation of additional property that belonged to the deportees. Though the laws were abolished in 1986, the General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre (Turkish: Tapu ve Kadastro Genel Müdürlüğü) issued an order on 29 June 2001 which effectively transferred all the leftover "abandoned" properties to the government.{{sfn|Kardeş|2012|pp=183-4}}{{#tag:ref|Decree no.

|Andonyan Monastery
|The monastery was built sometime in the 1860s.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=125}}

The monastery was described in a letter dated 24 June 1913 as a "house with garden and land located at 60 Ortaköy Pişmişoğlu Street (known as Çevirmeci Street today), leased from (icareli) the Sultan Beyazıt Veli Hazretleri Foundation, 9000 zira (approximately 5167 square meters), and previously leased (icareli) from the Ibrahim Pasha Foundation, 1000 zira (approximately 574 squaremeters)."{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=125}}

The monastery was formally registered on 14 October 1913.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=127}}

With the last priest dying in 1924, the property was left vacant. Nevertheless, the title remained in the hands of the Armenian community during the 1936 declaration.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=127}}

On 23 February 1950, the land along with the monastery was rendered "ownerless" and was subsequently confiscated by the Treasury.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=129}}

A lawsuit was filed on 20 December 1966 against Istanbul Chamber of the Directorate of Law and the Treasury for unlawfully seizing the land and the building. The 15th Civil Court of Istanbul rejected the claims in 1974.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=129}}

Through renewed legal efforts by the Directorate General of Foundations in 2006, the property is now in the hands of the Directorate General of Foundations.{{sfn|Atılgan; Eren; Mildanoğlu; Polatel|2012|p=129}}

'''''Death playing chess''''' (in Swedish: '''''Döden spelar schack''''') is a monumental painting in [[Täby Church]] located just outside [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. It was painted around 1480–1490, by the Swedish medieval painter [[Albertus Pictor]].&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063602/SWE_280_001.html |title=Death Playing Chess, Albertus |website=europeana.eu |language=en |access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A copy of the mural is stored in the collections of the [[Swedish Museum of History]] in Stockholm.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"/&gt;

==Analysis==
The artist was born with the name Albrecht, and was sometimes called Immenhusen, after the village Immenhusen in [[Hessen]], Germany. It is assumed that Albertus was educated in southern Germany.

He is one of the most significant medieval Swedish artists. His works represent a unique combination of quality and quantity. He painted 36 churches in [[Malardalen]] and [[Norrbotten]]. He stands out as the most active artist in the Swedish church painting in the second half of the [[15th century]]. He differs from other artists of the same period with his bright expression. His painting has unusual breadth and diversity in his technical performance. This mural represents how a knight plays chess with death and skillfully depicts figures with precise anatomical proportions, combining them with clothes and weapons, with a relatively realistic vision.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"/&gt;

The mural inspired Ingmar Bergman to create the film ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'' in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Bäckstedt, Eva. {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Democrite.JPG|thumb|200px|''Democrites meditating on the seat of the soul'', by [[Léon-Alexandre Delhomme]], 1868]]
'''''Democritus meditating on the seat of the soul''''' (''Démocrite méditant sur le siège de l'âme'') is a [[statue]] by [[Léon-Alexandre Delhomme]] (1841–1895), exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1868. It shows the Greek philosopher [[Democritus]], his eyes fixed on a skull he holds in his hands. It is now exhibited in the garden of the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon]].

On its base is inscribed an extract from the 29th fable of [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]]:&lt;ref&gt;Livre VIII - fable XXVI - Démocrite et les abdéritains&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"[[Hippocrates]] in time arrived at the conclusion that he had not sought whether the heart or the head was the seat of either reason or sense in man and beast"

'''Dichromatism''' (or polychromatism) is a phenomenon where a material or solution's [[hue]] is dependent on both the concentration of the absorbing substance and the depth or thickness of the medium traversed.&lt;ref&gt;Kennard IG, Howell DH (1941) Types of colouring in minerals. Am Mineral 26:405–421&lt;/ref&gt; In most substances which are not dichromatic, only the brightness and saturation of the colour depend on their concentration and layer thickness.

[[File:Kurbiskernol.jpg|thumb|A drop of pumpkin seed oil on a white plate, showing dichromatism]]
Examples of dichromatic substances are [[pumpkin seed oil]], [[bromophenol blue]], and [[resazurin]].
When the layer of pumpkin seed oil is less than 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm thick, the oil appears bright green, and in layer thicker than this, it appears bright red.

The phenomenon is related to both the physical chemistry properties of the substance and the physiological response of the [[visual system|human visual system]] to colour. This combined physicochemical–physiological basis was first explained in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Kreft S and Kreft M (2007) Physicochemical and physiological basis of dichromatic colour, Naturwissenschaften 94, 935-939. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/h5630lr536pj1333/fulltext.pdf On-line PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical explanation==
Dichromatic properties can be explained by the [[Beer-Lambert law]] and by the excitation characteristics of the three types of cone [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]]s in the human [[retina]]. Dichromatism is potentially observable in any substance that has an absorption spectrum with one wide but shallow local minimum and one narrow but deep local minimum. The apparent width of the deep minimum may also be limited by the end of the visible range of human eye; in this case, the true full width may not necessarily be narrow. As the thickness of the substance increases, the perceived hue changes from that defined by the position of the wide-but-shallow minimum (in thin layers) to the hue of the deep-but-narrow minimum (in thick layers).

The absorbance spectrum of pumpkin seed oil has the wide-but-shallow minimum in the green region of the spectrum and deep local minimum in the red region. In thin layers, the absorption at any specific green wavelength is not as low as it is for the red minimum, but a broader band of greenish wavelengths are transmitted, and hence the overall appearance is green. The effect is enhanced by the greater sensitivity to green of the photoreceptors in the human eye, and the narrowing of the red transmittance band by the long-wavelength limit of cone photoreceptor sensitivity.
According to the Beer-Lambert law, when viewing through the coloured substance (and thus ignoring reflection), the proportion of light transmitted at a given wavelength, ''T'', decreases exponentially with thickness ''t'', T = e&lt;sup&gt;−''at''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''a'' is the absorbance at that wavelength. Let ''G'' = e&lt;sup&gt;−''a''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; be the green transmittance and ''R'' = e&lt;sup&gt;−''a''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; be the red transmittance. The ratio of the two transmitted intensities is then (''G''/''R'') = e&lt;sup&gt;(''a''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;-''a''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;)''t''&lt;/sup&gt;. If the red absorbance is less than the green, then as the thickness ''t'' increases, so does the ratio of red to green transmitted light, which causes the apparent hue of the colour to switch from green to red.

==Quantification==
The extent of dichromatism of material can be quantified by the [[Kreft's dichromaticity index]] (DI). It is defined as the difference in [[hue]] angle (Δh&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;) between the colour of the sample at the dilution, where the [[colorfulness|chroma]] (colour saturation) is maximal and the colour of four times more diluted (or thinner) and four times more concentrated (or thicker) sample. The two hue angle differences are called dichromaticity index towards lighter (Kreft's DI&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) and
dichromaticity index towards darker (Kreft's DI&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This means that pumpkin oil changes its colour from green-yellow to orange-red (for 44 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] in [[Lab colour space]]) when the thickness of the observed layer is increased from cca 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm to 2&amp;nbsp;mm; and it changes slightly towards green (for 9 degrees) if its thickness is reduced for 4-fold.

==History==
A record by [[William Herschel]] (1738–1822), shows he observed dichromatism with a solution of ferrous sulphate and tincture of nutgall in 1801 when working on an early [[solar telescope]], but he did not recognise the effect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=Lilienthal%20telescope&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false '''The History of the Telescope''' - By Henry C.

A '''fibula''' (/ˈfɪbjʊlə/, plural '''fibulae''' /ˈfɪbjʊli/) is a brooch or pin for fastening garments. The fibula developed in a variety of shapes, but all were based on the [[safety-pin]] principle.  Technically, the Latin term, [[wikt:fibula#Latin|fibulae]], refers to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] brooches; however, the term is widely used to refer to brooches from the entire [[ancient]] and [[early medieval]] world that continue Roman forms. Nevertheless, its use in English is more restricted than in other languages, and in particular post-Roman brooches from the [[British Isles]] are just called brooches (for example, the [[penannular brooch]]es), where in German they would probably be ''fibulae''.

[[File:Bronze_cloak_pin_ca._2200_BC.jpg|thumb|upright|A cloak pin]]
Unlike most modern brooches, fibulae were not only decorative; they originally served a practical function: to fasten [[clothes|clothing]], such as [[cloak]]s. Fibulae replaced straight [[pin]]s that were used to fasten clothing in the [[Neolithic]] period and the [[Bronze Age]]. In turn, fibulae were replaced as clothing fasteners by [[button]]s in the Middle Ages. Their descendant, the modern safety pin, remains in use today. In [[ancient Rome]] and other places where Latin was used, the same word denoted both a brooch and the [[fibula|fibula bone]] because a popular form for brooches and the shape of the bone were thought to resemble one another.

There are hundreds of different types of fibulae. They are usually divided into families that are based upon historical periods, geography, and/or cultures. Fibulae are also divided into classes that are based upon their general forms.

Lost fibulae, usually fragments, are frequently dug up by amateur coin and relic hunters using [[metal detector]]s.

== Construction ==

Most fibulae are made of [[bronze]] (more properly "[[copper]] [[alloy]]") or [[iron]], or both. Some fibulae are made of [[precious metal]]s such as [[silver]] or [[gold]]. Most fibulae are made of only one or two pieces. Many fibulae are decorated with [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[semi-precious stone]]s, [[glass]], [[Coral (precious)|coral]] or [[bone]].

== Components ==
[[File:Silver fibula (brooch) from Værløse, Zealand, Denmark (DR EM85;123).jpg|thumb|Detail of the [[Elder Futhark]] [[Runic alphabet|runic]] inscription on the pinholder of the 3rd-century AD [[Værløse Fibula]] followed by a [[swastika]].]]
Fibulae were composed of four components: The body, pin, spring, and hinge.

===Body===
The body of a fibula is known as either the bow or the plate, depending on the basic form. A bow is generally long and narrow, and often arched. A plate is flat and wide. Plates could be solid or openwork. The body was often decorated. The head is the end of the fibula with the [[Spring (device)|spring]] or [[hinge]]. The foot is the end of the fibula where the pin closes. Depending on the type of fibula, and the [[culture]] in question, the head of the fibula could be worn facing up, down or sideways.

===Pin===
The pin that is used to fasten the [[clothing]] is either a continuation of the fibula's body or a separate piece attached to the body. The fibula is closed by connecting the end of the pin to a catch plate, or pin rest.

===Spring===
The body and pin meet at either a spring or [[hinge]]. The earliest design is the spring which provides tension to the pin. The spring could be unilateral or bilateral. A unilateral spring winds around in one direction only. Unilateral springs are the earliest type, first appearing around the 14th century BC. Bilateral springs wind in one or more loops on one side of the pin and then cross over or under the bow and continue with more loops on the other side. They appeared around the 6th century BC. Bilateral springs can be very short, with only one or two revolutions per side, or up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm long. Most bilateral springs are made of one piece of metal and therefore have a spring cord, a piece of wire extending from one end of the spring to the other. The spring cord can pass in front of or behind the fibulae body. Bilateral springs wrap around a pin or axle. These are usually made of iron even if the rest of the fibula and spring is copper alloy. In the 1st century AD some fibulae had springs that were concealed under a metal cover that was an extension of the fibula body. These are known as covered springs, or hidden springs.

===Hinge===
In the late 1st century BC or early 1st century AD a new design appeared in some bow type fibulae. A separate pin was attached to the head-end of the bow with a small hinge. In the second half of the 1st century AD, hinges were introduced to plate type fibulae. One or two small plaques were cast on the back of the plate and a pin was attached to them by a small hinge. Previously, plate type fibulae had bilateral springs attached to the back. In the 3rd century AD, the hinge was placed in the centre of a long transverse bar creating the famous [[crossbow]] fibula design. A few fibulae from a much earlier date also had hinges, although this design feature was very rare and soon died out for nearly five centuries. For example, the [[Asia Minor]] Decorated Arc Fibula (Blinkenberg Type XII Variation 16) dating to the 5th century BC.

It is important to note that different types of fibula construction were used contemporaneously. Though the introduction of the hinge was later than the introduction of the spring, the spring remained in use long after the hinge was introduced. Therefore, a given fibula with hinge is not necessarily more recent than one with a spring.

== Use ==

Fibulae were originally used to fasten [[clothing]]. They represent an improvement on the earlier straight [[pin]] which was less secure and could fall out. While the head of the earlier straight pin was often decorated, the bow or plate of the fibula provided a much increased scope for decoration. Among some [[culture]]s, different fibula designs had specific [[symbolic meaning]]s. They could refer to a status or profession such as single woman, married woman, man, warrior, or chief. Some Roman-era fibulae may symbolize specific ranks or positions in the [[Roman legion]]s or auxiliary. In some cultures, fibulae were worn in pairs and could be linked by a length of chain. The Romans also used [[fibula (penile)|fibulas to fasten the foreskin]] above the penis, thus hiding the glans, this was done both to show modesty and in the belief that it helped preserve the voice.

== Historical development ==

=== Bronze Age fibulae ===
[[File:Fibulae01.JPG|right|thumb|Early fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;10th – 8th centuries BC]]

'''The first fibulae design''', violin bow fibulae (''drahtbugel'' in German), appeared in the [[late Bronze Age]]. This simple design, with a unilateral spring, looks remarkably like a modern [[safety pin]]. The violin bow fibula has a low flat arch; the body runs parallel to the pin so it resembles a [[violin]] bow. The bow could be round, square, or flat and ribbon-like in cross-section. Some had simple punched or incised decoration on the bow. Violin bow fibula, such as the Peschiera type and the Unter-Radl type, was introduced in the 14th century BC (Late Mycenean III era) by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]]s on the Greek [[Peloponnesus]]. The fibula soon spread to [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]] trading posts in [[Sicily]].

There were several variants of the violin bow fibula. The bow could bend, or [[zig-zag]] from side to side while still remaining flat and parallel to the pin. These variants, such as the Grunwald type and the Hanua type, were found in the 12th and 11th centuries BC. In another variant, the bow, while still flat, widened out into an oval or diamond shape (blattbugel in German). These variants, such as the Kreuznach type and Reisen type, were found in the 12th to 10th centuries BC.
[[File:Violin bow fibula .jpg|thumb|10th century BC]]

'''The second major design''' of fibulae has a high, rounded [[arch]] (''bogen'' in German) instead of the low flat arch of the violin bow fibula. At first, the bow was thin. In later variants the bow was made of thicker metal or of two pieces of thin [[wire]] twisted together. These rounded bow fibulae were first found in the 12th century BC, but lasted in use in some places for more than five centuries.
[[File:Fibulae02.JPG|right|thumb|Early bow fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;8th – 6th centuries BC]]

'''The third Bronze Age design''' of fibula consisted of horizontal wire [[spiral]]s. The spectacle fibula (brillen in German) consisted of two spirals joined together. It resembles a pair of [[spectacles]] or eye [[glasses]]. These fibulae, such as the Haslau type and the St. Lucija type, were found in the 9th to 7th centuries BC. Some spectacle fibula were very large with spirals up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm across. A variant that appeared in the 6th century BC had four small spirals with a square, or squarish, cover plate on the middle, the Vierpass type.

The [[Villanovan culture]] in [[Italy]] introduced a series of variations of the bow fibula in the 8th and 7th centuries BC. In these so-called Italianate fibulae, the bow begins, at the head, with a semi-circular form, but bends at its apex to angle straight down to the foot that was often lengthened and extended. The bow was often decorated with moulded knobs or spikes. The rear half of the bow was sometimes bent into a wavy, kinked shape. The latter variants were known as [[serpentine shape|serpentine]] fibulae.

Meanwhile, the 8th and 7th centuries BC saw the introduction of the so-called [[Phrygia]]n bow fibulae in [[Asia Minor]]. These fibulae had a near-perfect semi-circular arch sometimes decorated with knobs or round flanges. In the same period, the Hand or Arm fibula spread from [[Cyprus]], where it appears to have originated, to [[Syria]], [[Assyria]] and [[Persia]]. In this design the bow was bent 90 degrees at the apex giving the fibula a [[triangular]] shape when viewed from the side. The bow was usually decorated with a series of rings and dots. The catch plate usually had the form of a hand, making the entire fibula resemble an arm.

In the 7th and 6th centuries BC, a series of variations of the bow fibula appeared in the southern [[Balkans]], known variously as [[Greece|Greek]], [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]], or [[Thracian]] bow fibulae. The high arched bow of these fibulae had large fins or knobs. The bow usually ended in a very large triangular or square catch plate. Some of the large square catch plates were decorated with complex incised [[geometric]] or figural designs. Some of the fibula had a flat back indicating that they were likely cast in simple, open [[mould]]s.

=== Iron Age fibulae ===

The [[Iron Age]] saw an expansion in the use of fibulae. The rounded bow fibula underwent several variations and were usually highly decorated with incised or moulded [[geometric]] designs. In one variation, the foot of the fibula that had previously terminated at the end of the arch with a simple catch plate, lengthened significantly. These extended foot fibulae, such as the Kahn type and the Pauken type, were found in the 7th to 5th centuries BC. The first long, bilateral springs appeared on some of these variants in the [[Hallstatt]] D2 era (5th century BC). These fibulae, such as the Doublezier type, looked similar to the Roman-era [[crossbow]] fibulae but were not the latter’s direct precursor.

[[File:Fibulae03.JPG|right|thumb|More early fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;7th – 5th centuries BC]]
[[File:Dacian fibulae Cluj Musem 1st century BC.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Typical silver Dacian fibulae 1st century BC (Museum of Transylvania Cluj Romania]]

In another variation of the rounded bow fibula, the bow became fat and swollen-looking. In many of these [[Leech]] Bow, or Sanguisaga, fibulae the catch plate became large and triangular. Another variant, the Certossa type, had a small square or ribbon cross-section bow and a short bilateral spring (possibly the first use of a bilateral spring). Certossa fibulae are almost always very small.

In the [[La Tene]] I, or La Tene A to B2, era (4th to 3rd centuries BC), fibula design became relatively standardised over a large geographic area, although minor stylistic variations and differences in decoration remained. The La Tene I fibula usually had a narrow bow. The spring that could be either unilateral or bilateral, was wound in a fairly large diameter circle. The foot was turned up and usually ended in a decorated knob or with an applied [[bead]] or stone. In some cases the raised foot was bent back towards the bow, although it did not touch the bow. The Thraco-Getic fibula is a variant found in the eastern [[Balkans]] and used by the [[Getae]]. The fibula's foot is vertical and ends in a small knob, though later models had a sinuous, s-shaped profile.

[[File:La Tene, Thraco-Getic and Nauheim Fibulae.jpg|right|thumb|La Tene era fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;4th – 1st centuries BC]]

The La Tene I era also saw the introduction of the first animal, or [[zoomorphic]], designs. These included [[birds]] and [[horse]]s and could either be flat, with a short bilateral spring on the back, or [[dimension|three-dimensional]] ("in the round") with a long bilateral spring at the head.

In the La Tene II, or La Tene C era (2nd century BC), the foot of the fibula actually bent back to touch the bow and was wrapped around it. Many La Tene II fibulae had long bilateral springs. It is important to be aware that this type of construction was in use several centuries later in the tied-foot and returned-foot types of fibulae. These latter types are sometimes known as pseudo-La Tene fibulae.

In the La Tene III, or La Tene D era (1st century BC), the raised foot was no longer wrapped around the bow but was attached directly to it by [[casting]] or [[welding]] creating a loop above the foot. In one variant, the Nauheim type, the bow widened into a flat triangle or diamond. In another variant, the Schussel type, the ribbon-like bow widened at the head into a rounded [[arrowhead]] shape that covered the spring.

===Roman-era fibulae===

====The 1st century AD====

File:Fibulae08.JPG|Kraftig Profilierte fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;1st – 2nd centuries AD
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The rapid spread of the [[Roman Empire]] by the 1st century AD resulted in a tremendous growth in the number and design of fibulae throughout [[Europe]] and the [[Near East]]. The spread of technologically advanced workshops in the Roman Empire led to more complex fibula designs. Bows were cast in more complex forms, hinges appeared alongside bilateral springs and a wide variety of plate designs were introduced.

One of the first fibula designs of the Roman-era began in the [[La Tene]] III era, in the late 1st century BC. The Straight Wire fibula, also known as the Soldier’s type or [[Roman legion|Legionnaire]]'s type, is a very plain design. It resembles the violin bow fibula of over one thousand years earlier except that the bow has slightly more of an arch and the spring in (short) bilateral not unilateral. The Straight Wire fibula is found through the 1st century AD.

In the 1st century AD, for the first time, several fibula designs originated in [[Roman Britain]]. Perhaps the most distinctive British fibula design was the Dolphin. This was actually a series of designs including the Polden Hill type, the Langton Down type, the Colchester type and the T-Shaped type. Dolphin fibulae have a smooth arched bow that tapers from the head to end in a long point. The long bilateral spring is covered. From the top the Dolphin fibula looks like a T or the late-Roman [[crossbow]] fibula. From the side it resembles a leaping [[dolphin]].

[[File:Fibulae09.JPG|150px|thumb|Roman era plate fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;1st century AD]]
Another British design was the Hod Hill type. Usually quite small, Hod Hill fibulae have a shallow arched bow that appears to be made up of lumpy segments. Many Hod Hill fibulae have a pair of small side [[lug (knob)|lug]]s.

The Fantail fibula, which have a short bow that flares into a flat, wide fan-shaped foot, were common in Britain and on the European continent. The Fantail design lasted into the 2nd century AD. A common and widespread design was the Augen (or Eye) fibula, which has a longer bow and a long, flat, wide foot. It has a short bilateral spring. Many Augen fibulae are decorated with a pair of ringed dots, or eyes, on the flat foot. Augen fibulae appear to have been introduced to the [[Roman Empire]] by [[Germanic peoples]], notably [[Marcomanni]], serving as [[Roman auxiliaries]].

The Aucissa fibula was another widespread design. It has a high semi-circular arched bow that extended into a short foot. The bow is flat and wide and has a rounded central ridge. The bow ends, at the head, in a hinge. The Aucissa was one of the first fibulae to use a hinge instead of a spring. The foot ends in a rounded knob. Many Aucissa fibulae have the word “AVCISSA” moulded above the hinge. This is thought to be the name of a [[workshop]].

The 1st century AD saw several other bow variations. The Wolf or Wolf’s Head fibula has a flat, ribbon-like bow that widens into a square section at the head. The common design of two circles and a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] near the rear of the bow is often interpreted as a [[wolf]]’s head. The [[Thracian]] Anchor type has a wide [[crescent]] at the head giving the fibula an [[anchor]] shape. The Thracian Anchor type is also called the Illyrian and is found in [[Pannonia]] ([[Hungary]]), [[Dacia]] ([[Romania]]) and [[Serbia]].

The late 1st century AD saw the introduction of the Kraftig Profilierte group of fibula designs. Kraftig Profilierte fibulae have a wide fan-, or [[bell (instrument)|bell]]-shaped head and a long thin pointy foot. They have long bilateral hinges. There are three main variations of the Kraftig Profilierte fibula. The North Pannonian Double Knot type, found in [[Pannonia]] has two knobs, or knots, on the bow. The Single Knot type, found in the central [[Balkans]], has a single knob. The Black Sea type, found in the [[steppes]] north of the [[Black Sea]], has a thin body, with no flaring near the head, and two knots. Kraftig Profilierte fibulae were found in the late 1st to late 2nd centuries AD and are mostly associated with the [[Przeworsk]] proto-[[Goths|Gothic]] culture.

The 1st century AD saw the widespread use of plate fibulae. Plate fibulae consist of a flat plate. Since there is little space between the fibula body and the pin (there is no arch to the body), plate fibulae could not be used to fasten much material and were therefore mainly [[decorative]]. Most plate fibulae have a hinge assembly on the back. Plate fibulae are generally associated with women’s [[Grave (burial)|grave]]s. The most common forms of plate fibula in the 1st century AD were round (disc), diamond, oval and lunula ([[crescent]]- or moon-shaped).

==== The 2nd century AD ====

File:Fibulae12.JPG|Tutulus plate fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;2nd – 3rd centuries AD
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In [[Roman Britain]] the fibula designs common in the 1st century AD continued to some extent into the second, although usually in more complex variations. A new design, the Head Stud type, has a long bow with a [[wikt:stud#Etymology 2|stud]], or occasionally a ring, at the head.

The Knee fibula, a common design in the 2nd century AD, originated in Roman [[Pannonia]] (modern [[Hungary]]). With its short, fat bow that incorporates a 90 degree bend, [[archeologists]] thought it resembled a [[knee]] and leg. Many Knee fibulae have small rectangular, or larger semi-circular head plates. Knee fibulae appear, like the Augen type, to have been introduced into the [[Roman Empire]] by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] allies. Despite their small size, their appearance in [[Roman military]] graves implies that the Knee fibula was the most popular fibula among Roman soldiers in the 2nd century AD. They are rarely found outside military sites or contexts.

The Pannonian Trumpet fibula has a wide flaring head like the bell of a [[trumpet]]. However, unlike a straight trumpet, the Pannonian Trumpet fibula is sharply bent near the head. This [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] design was found in and around [[Pannonia]] but was exported as widely as [[Roman Britain|Britain]].

The P-Shaped type is another common 2nd-century AD fibula design that originated among the [[Germanic peoples]]. The P-Shaped fibula, or Almgren Type 162, has a semi-circular arch and a long foot that curves back under itself to return to the base of the arch. They have bilateral springs. The bows of P-Shaped fibulae are usually semi-circular in cross-section and are decorated with ribs. P-Shaped fibulae were found from the 2nd to the early 4th centuries.

There were other bow fibula variations of the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. The Divided Bow type has an arched bow and a long foot. The arch was made up of two, or even three, separate, but parallel, arches. These arches are either wide and flat or narrow and tall. The Trident fibula has a rounded arch and long foot and a wide, flat head plate with three points. The entire fibula looks like a [[trident]]. Claims that this was the standard fibula of the [[Roman navy]] are unfounded.

The use of plate fibulae continued in the 2nd century CE. Simple flat shapes were replaced with [[vitreous enamel|enamelled]] versions or more complex shapes. These included animal ([[zoomorphic]]) shapes ([[birds]], [[horses]], [[rabbits]], flies, etc.), letters or words, abstract [[symmetrical]] or [[asymmetrical]] designs (including the so-called [[Celt]]ic Trumpet designs), and [[skeuomorphic]] designs ([[symbol]]ic designs). Most designs continued in use throughout the 2nd and 3rd centuries. In one later variation during this time, the Tutulus type, the circular disc plate was extended upwards to form a [[cone]].

====The 3rd to 4th centuries AD====

The use of [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]led [[inlay]] continued until the end of the 3rd century AD.

[[File:Fibulae13.JPG|right|thumb|P-shaped fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;3rd – 5th centuries AD]]

A variation of the P-shaped fibula, the tied foot fibula has a foot that returns to the bow but then wraps, or ties, around the bow. Many Tied Foot fibulae have long bilateral springs. The tied foot fibula was found in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD and is associated with the [[Wielbark Culture|Wielbark]] [[Goths|Gothic]] culture.

The classic fibula of the late-Roman era, and in fact the best known of all fibula types, is the [[crossbow]] type. The crossbow fibula consists of a highly arched semi-circular bow, usually of squarish cross-section, and a long flat foot. The fibula has a wide transverse bar (or arms) at the head containing the pin-hinge. Crossbow fibulae usually have three round or onion-shaped knobs: one at the head and one at each end of the transverse bar.

[[File:Fibulae15.JPG|left|thumb|Crossbow fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;3rd – 5th centuries AD]]

The first crossbow fibulae, from the early 3rd century AD, has short, thin arms, no knobs, a long bow and a short foot. The later crossbow fibulae have been divided into groups by several [[archeologist]]s including Keller, Prottel and Soupault. Type I, dating to the 3rd and 4th centuries, has small, simple knobs and a foot that is shorter than the bow. Type II, dating to the 4th century, has larger knobs and a foot that is approximately the same length as the bow. Type III, also dating to the 4th century, has a foot that is longer than the bow. There are several variants of the Type III based on the decoration of the foot: dotted circles, [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]s, or [[curlicue]]s. Another variant, dating to the 4th and 5th centuries, the Bugelkopf type, has no transverse bar, or arms at all but retains the round knob at the head.

=== Post-Roman fibulae ===

[[File:Fibulae16.JPG|right|thumb|Post-Roman fibulae.&lt;br /&gt;5th – 10th centuries AD]]
[[File:Brooches.JPG|left|thumb|High status Frankish brooches in the [[British Museum]], France 5th Century AD]]
There are numerous types of post-Roman fibulae. The so-called [[Goths|Gothic]] group of bow fibulae have a round or triangular flat head plate, often with 3, 5 or 7 knobs, a small arched bow and a long flat diamond shaped foot. They were widely used by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Visigoths]], [[Ostrogoths]], and [[Gepids]], and the non-Germanic [[Slavs]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], and are found over a wide part of southern and western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries AD. There are also a wide variety of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] fibulae from the 5th to 7th century such as the equal-arm type and the small-long type. Most [[Viking]] fibulae are variations on the ring or annular design (see below).

=== Ring fibulae and penannular brooches ===
[[File:Ireland 2010 etc 029 (2).jpg|thumb|left|The pseudo-penannular  [[Tara Brooch]], the most ornate of Irish brooches, also decorated on the back (see article). Early 8th century.]]
{{main article|Penannular brooch}}

The ring, or annular, fibula or brooch is extremely hard to date as the design for utilitarian pieces was almost unchanged from the 2nd to the 14th centuries AD. If there is decoration, this is likely to indicate whether a given ring fibula is Roman-era fibula or a  medieval brooch.

The [[penannular brooch]], with an incomplete ring and two terminals, originally a common utilitarian clothes fastening, normally of [[base metal]], in Iron Age and [[Roman Britain]] developed in the post-Roman period into highly elaborate and decorative marks of status in Ireland and Scotland, made in precious metals and often decorated with gems, and worn by men and women, as well as the clergy as part of their [[vestment]]s when conducting services.  The finest period is from the 8th and 9th centuries, before the Vikings disrupted the societies.  Ornate Irish examples in the period are usually "pseudo-penannular"; in fact closed rings, but imitating the penannular form.  Examples like the [[Tara Brooch]] are among the most spectacular pieces of jewellery of the Early Medieval period. When the Vikings began to raid and settle the British Isles, they took to wearing these brooches, but now in plain silver.  The thistle and bossed types were the most popular styles, both developing out of earlier Celtic styles.  The post-Roman types are not called "fibulae" in English, though they are in other languages.

=== Medieval brooches ===
[[File:Bulesølje med Hellig Olaf.JPG|thumb| Brooch of gilded silver featuring  Saint Olav in the center with an ax in his left hand.  ([[National Museum of Denmark]] in Copenhagen)]] 
There is a huge variety of [[medieval]] brooch types (the term fibula is rarely used for medieval items). The two most common are ring brooches, including square and lobed or flower designs as well as round ones, and flat plate brooches, or [[badge]]s, in the form of people or animals, with specialized types such as [[pilgrim badge]]s or [[livery badge]]s, which were often produced in large quantities in cheap metals such as lead, but also in very expensive forms such as the [[Dunstable Swan Jewel]].  However these are mostly purely decorative, or worn to denote something about the wearer, and were probably not much used for fastening.

{{See also|Baroque painting}}

'''Flemish Baroque painting''' refers to the art produced in the [[Southern Netherlands]] during Spanish control in the 16th and 17th centuries. The period roughly begins when the [[Dutch Republic]] was split from the [[Habsburg Spain]] regions to the south with the Spanish recapturing of [[Antwerp]] in 1585 and goes until about 1700, when Habsburg authority ended with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|King Charles II]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe1"&gt;Vleighe, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Antwerp, home to the prominent artists [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], and [[Jacob Jordaens]], was the artistic nexus, while other notable cities include [[Brussels]] and [[Ghent]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe1" /&gt;

Rubens, in particular, had a strong influence on seventeenth-century visual culture. His innovations helped define Antwerp as one of Europe's major artistic cities, especially for [[Counter Reformation]] imagery, and his student Van Dyck was instrumental in establishing new directions in English portraiture. Other developments in Flemish [[Baroque]] painting are similar to those found in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]],&lt;ref name="vlieghe1" /&gt; with artists specializing in such areas as [[history painting]], [[portrait painting|portraiture]], [[genre painting]], [[landscape painting]], and [[still life]].
{{History of Dutch and Flemish painting}}

==General characteristics==
"Flemish", in the context of this and artistic periods such as the "Flemish Primitives" (in English now [[Early Netherlandish painting]]), often includes the regions not associated with modern [[Flanders]], including the [[Duchy of Brabant]] and the autonomous [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe1" /&gt; By the seventeenth century, however, Antwerp was the main city for innovative artistic production, largely due to the presence of Rubens. Brussels was important as the location of the court, attracting [[David Teniers the Younger]] later in the century.

[[File:Frans Hogenberg Bildersturm 1566.jpg|thumb|left|Frans Hogenberg, The Calvinist [[beeldenstorm|Iconoclastic Riot of August 20, 1566]] when many paintings and church decorations were destroyed and subsequently replaced by late [[Northern Mannerist]] and Baroque artists.]]

===Late Mannerism===
Although paintings produced at the end of the 16th century belong to general [[Northern Mannerist]] and Late [[Renaissance]] approaches that were common throughout Europe, artists such as [[Otto van Veen]], [[Adam van Noort]], [[Marten de Vos]], and the [[Francken]] family were particularly instrumental in setting the stage for the local Baroque. Between 1585 and the early 17th century they made many new [[altarpiece]]s to replace those destroyed during the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] [[beeldenstorm|outbreaks of 1566]]. Also during this time [[Frans Francken the Younger]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] became important for their small [[cabinet painting]]s, often depicting [[Mythology|mythological]] and history subjects.

==="The Age of Rubens"===
[[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1577–1640), a student of both Otto van Veen and Adam van Noort, spent eight years in Italy (1600–1608), during which time he studied examples of [[classical antiquity]], the [[Italian Renaissance]], and contemporaries [[Adam Elsheimer]] and [[Caravaggio]]. Following his return to Antwerp he set up an important studio, training students such as Anthony van Dyck, and generally exerting a strong influence on the direction of Flemish art. Most artists active in the city during the first half of the 17th century were directly influenced by Rubens.

[[File:Rubens - Prometheus Bound.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Peter Paul Rubens and Frans Snyders, ''Prometheus Bound'', 1611-12. Philadelphia Museum of Art. This painting is Flemish Baroque example of collaboration and specialization. Snyders, who specialized in animals, painted the eagle while Rubens painted the figure of Prometheus.]]

===Specializations and collaborations===
Flemish art is notable for the large amount of collaboration that took place between independent masters, which was partly related to the local tendency to specialize in a particular area. [[Frans Snyders]], for example, was an animal painter and Jan Brueghel the Elder was admired for his landscapes and paintings of plants. Both artists worked with Rubens, who often usually painted the figures, and other artists to create collaborative pieces.

[[File:Frans Francken d. J. 009.jpg|thumb|left|Frans Francken the Younger, ''Preziosenwand'' (''Wall of Treasures''), 1636. Kunsthistorischesmuseum, Vienna. This type of painting was one of the distinctly Flemish innovations that developed during the early 17th century.]]

===Innovations===
Flower [[still life]] painting, which developed around 1600 by artists such as Jan Brueghel the Elder, was partially a Flemish innovation,&lt;ref name="vlieghe207"&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 207–212.&lt;/ref&gt; echoed in the Dutch Republic in the works of the Antwerp-born [[Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder]] (1573–1621).&lt;ref&gt;Slive, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; In Antwerp, however, this new genre also developed into a specifically [[Catholic]] type of painting, the [[flower garland]]. Other types of paintings closely associated with Flemish Baroque include the monumental hunting scenes by Rubens and Snyders, and [[gallery paintings]] by artists such as [[Willem van Haecht]] and [[David Teniers the Younger]].

==History painting==
History painting, which includes biblical, mythological and historical subjects, was considered by seventeenth-century theoreticians as the most noble art. [[Abraham Janssens]] was an important history painter in Antwerp between 1600 and 1620, although after 1609 Rubens was the leading figure. Both Van Dyck and [[Jacob Jordaens]] were active painting monumental history scenes. Following Rubens's death, Jordaens became the most important Flemish painter. Other notable artists working in the idiom of Rubens include [[Gaspar de Crayer]], who was active in Brussels, [[Artus Wolffort]], [[Cornelis de Vos]], [[Jan Cossiers]], [[Theodoor van Thulden]], [[Abraham van Diepenbeeck]], and [[Jan Boeckhorst]]. During the second half of the century, history painters combined a local influence from Rubens with knowledge of [[classicism]] and Italian [[Baroque]] qualities. Artists in the vein include [[Erasmus Quellinus the Younger]], [[Jan van den Hoecke]], [[Pieter van Lint]], [[Cornelis Schut]], and [[Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert]]. Later in the century, many painters turned to Anthony van Dyck as a major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 98–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them were [[Pieter Thijs]], [[Lucas Franchoys the Younger]], and artists who were also inspired by Late Baroque theatricality such as [[Theodoor Boeyermans]] and [[Jan-Erasmus Quellinus]]. Additionally, a Flemish variant of ''[[Caravaggism]]'' was expressed by [[Theodoor Rombouts]] and [[Gerard Seghers]].

==Religious painting==
Rubens is closely associated with the development of the Baroque [[altarpiece]]. Painted for the Arquebusiers' [[guild]], the ''[[Descent from the Cross]]'' [[triptych]] (1611–14; [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp]])—with side wings depicting the ''[[Visitation (Christian)|Visitation]]'' and ''[[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Presentation in the Temple]]'', and exterior panels showing ''[[St. Christopher]] and the Hermit''—is an important reflection of Counter-Reformation ideas about art combined with Baroque naturalism, dynamism and monumentality.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp. 113–121.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger de Piles]] explains that "the painter has entered so fully into the expression of his subject that the sight of this work has the power to touch a hardened soul and cause it to experience the sufferings endured by Jesus Christ in order to redeem it."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Baroque'', pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles I of England.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Anthony van Dyck, ''Portrait of King Charles I'', 1635. Louvre, Paris.]]

==Portraiture==
Although not predominately a portrait painter, Rubens's contributions include early works such as his ''Portrait of Brigida Spinola-Doria'' (1606, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]), paintings of his wives (the ''[[Honeysuckle Bower]]'' and ''[[Het Pelsken]]''), and numerous portraits of friends and nobility. He also exerted a strong influence on Baroque portraiture through his student [[Anthony van Dyck]]. Van Dyck became court painter for [[Charles I of England]] and was influential on subsequent English portraiture. Other successful portraitists include [[Cornelis de Vos]] and [[Jacob Jordaens]]. Although most Flemish portraiture is life-sized or monumental, [[Gonzales Coques]] and [[Gillis van Tilborch]] specialized in small-scale group portraiture.
[[File:Adriaen Brouwer - The Bitter Potion - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Adriaen Brouwer, ''The Bitter Drink'', ''c''. 1630–1640. Brouwer's expressive peasants are typical of "low-life" genre painting.]]

==Genre painting==
[[Genre painting]]s, or scenes of everyday life, are common in the 17th century. Many artists follow the tradition of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] in depicting "low-life" peasant themes, although elegant "high-life" subjects featuring fashionably-dressed couples at [[Ball (dance)|balls]] or in gardens of love are also common. [[Adriaen Brouwer]], whose small paintings often show peasants fighting and drinking, was particularly influential on subsequent artists. Images of woman performing household tasks, popularized in the northern Netherlands by [[Pieter de Hooch]] and [[Jan Vermeer]], is not a significant subject in the south, although artists such as [[Jan Siberechts]] explored these themes to some degree.

===Bruegel tradition===
Flemish genre painting is strongly tied to the traditions of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] and was a style that continued directly into the 17th century through copies and new compositions made by his sons [[Pieter Brueghel the Younger]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]]. Many of these are [[Kermesse (festival)|kermis]] paintings and scenes of peasants taking part in other outdoor enjoyments viewed from an elevated viewpoint. Artists in the Dutch Republic, such as the Flemish-born [[David Vinckboons]] and [[Roelandt Savery]], also made similar works, popularizing rustic scenes of everyday life closely associated with Dutch and Flemish painting.

===Adriaen Brouwer and his followers===
[[Adriaen Brouwer]] (1605 or 1606–1638) typically painted small scenes of ragged peasants fighting, gaming, drinking and generally expressing exaggerated and rude behaviour. Born in the Southern Netherlands, Brouwer spent the 1620s in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Haarlem]], where he came under the influence of [[Frans Hals|Frans]] and [[Dirk Hals]] and other artists working in a loose [[painterly]] manner. Upon his return to Antwerp around 1631 or 1632 he introduced a new, influential format in which the subjects were painted as interior, instead of exterior, scenes. He also painted expressive facial studies like ''The Bitter Drink'' (illustrated), a genre called [[tronie]]s ("faces"). Brouwer's art was recognized in his own lifetime and had a powerful impact on Flemish art. Rubens owned more works by him at the time of his death than any other painter, and artists such as [[David Teniers the Younger]], [[Jan van de Venne]], [[Joos van Craesbeeck]] and [[David Ryckaert III]] continued to work in a similar manner.

===Elegant company scenes===
Paintings of elegant couples in the latest fashions, often with underlying themes of love or the [[sense|five senses]], were commonly painted by [[Hieronymus Francken II|Hieronymus Francken the Younger]], [[Louis de Caullery]], [[Simon de Vos]], [[David Teniers the Younger]] and [[David Ryckaert III]]. Rubens's ''Garden of Love'' (''c''. 1634–5; [[Prado Museum]]) belongs to these traditions.

===Monumental genre scenes===
Whereas elegant company scenes and works by Brouwer and his followers were often small in scale, other artists looked to [[Caravaggio]] for inspiration and painted large-scale, theatrically inspired scenes in which musicians, cardplayers, and fortune tellers are pushed to the foreground of the composition. These paintings, like others by ''[[Caravaggism|Caravaggisti]]'', are generally illuminated by strong lighting effects. [[Adam de Coster]], [[Gerard Seghers]] and [[Theodoor Rombouts]] were the main exponents of this popular style in the early 17th century, which was popularized by Italian followers of Caravaggio like [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]] and [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]] like [[Gerrit van Honthorst]]. Rombouts was also influenced by his teacher [[Abraham Janssens]], who began incorporating Caravaggesque influences into his history paintings from first decade of the 17th century
.
[[File:Jakob Jordaens 001.jpg|thumb|left|Jacob Jordaens, ''The King Drinks''. Jordeans was well known for his large paintings of moralistic genre scenes, such as this depiction of an [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] feast.]]

===Jacob Jordaens===
Jacob Jordaens, who became Antwerp's most important artist after Rubens's death in 1640, is well known for his monumental genre paintings of subjects such as ''The King Drinks'' and ''As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young''. Many of these paintings use compositional and lighting influences similar to those of the ''Caravaggisti'', while the treatment of the subjects inspired Dutch artists like [[Jan Steen]].

===Battle scenes===
Another popular type of painting invented in the [[Low Countries]] was landscapes with historical and fictional battles, as well as skirmishes and robberies. [[Sebastiaen Vrancx]] and his pupil [[Peter Snayers]] specialized in this genre, and Snayer's student [[Adam-Frans van der Meulen]] continued painting them in Antwerp, Brussels and [[Paris]] until the end of the century.

===Bamboccianti===
Following a time-honoured tradition, many northern artists travelled to Italy in the 17th century. Flemish artists such as [[Jan Miel]] (1599–1664), [[Michael Sweerts]] (1618–1664), [[Anton Goubau]] (1616–1698) and [[Willem Reuter]] (c.1642–1681) went to Rome where they worked for a period of time.  Here they were influenced by the works of the [[Genre works|genre painters]] active in Rome referred to as the [[Bamboccianti]].  The Bamboccianti comprised mostly [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Flemings|Flemish]] artists who had brought existing traditions of depicting peasant subjects from [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting|sixteenth-century Netherlandish art]] with them to Italy,&lt;ref name=lev&gt;Levine, David A. (December 1988). "The Roman Limekilns of the Bamboccianti". The Art Bulletin. College Art Association. 70 (4), p. 570&lt;/ref&gt; and generally created small [[cabinet painting]]s or [[etching]]s of the [[everyday life]] of the lower classes in Rome and its countryside.&lt;ref name="haskell"&gt;Haskell, Francis (1993). "Chapter 8". Patrons and Painters: Art and Society in Baroque Italy. Yale University Press, pp. 132–134.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch painter [[Pieter van Laer]] who was nicknamed  "Il Bamboccio" (meaning "ugly doll" or "puppet" in Italian) had started this type of genre painting in Rome.  In general, genre painting was not well-accepted in Italy, especially by official organizations such as the [[Academy of St. Luke]].  Many of the painters were alsom members of the [[Bentvueghels]], the society of mainly Flemish and Dutch artists working in Rome. It acted as a support network for Netherlandish artists in Rome who were in need but is better-known for the "[[bohemian]]" lifestyle of its members and drunken festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, David A., "The Bentvueghels: 'Bande Académique"," in IL60: Essays Honoring Irving Lavin on his Sixtieth Birthday, ed. Marilyn Aronberg Lavin. New York: Italica Press, 1990, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landscape and seascape==

===Early landscape painting===
[[Gillis van Coninxloo]] was an innovative landscape painter in Antwerp in the late 16th century, who introduced a more natural view instead of the traditional [[world landscape]] popularized by earlier painters such as [[Joachim Patiner]]. He left a strong influence on northern landscape painting in general through his period in [[Amsterdam]] and as a founding member of the [[Frankenthal School]]. Forest and mountain landscapes were painted by [[Abraham Govaerts]], [[Alexander Keirincx]], [[Gijsbrecht Leytens]], [[Tobias Verhaecht]] and [[Joos de Momper]]. [[Paul Bril]] settled in Rome, where he specialized as a landscape painter decorating Roman villas and creating small [[cabinet painting]]s.
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - A View of Het Steen in the Early Morning.jpg|thumb|left|Peter Paul Rubens, ''Landscape with view of 'Het Steen''', 1636.]]

===Rubens and later painters===
[[Jan Wildens]] and [[Lucas van Uden]] painted natural landscapes inspired by Rubens, and frequently collaborated with figure painters or animal specialists to paint the backgrounds. Rubens turned to landscape painting in the 1630s, focusing on the area around his chateau, Het Steen. A well-known example is the ''Landscape with a view of 'Het Steen''' ([[National Gallery of London]]).

===Marine painting===
Small seascapes (''zeekens'') were another popular theme. Artists such as [[Bonaventura Peeters]] painted shipwrecks and atmospheric views of ships at sea, as well as imaginary views of exotic ports. [[Hendrik van Minderhout]], who was from [[Rotterdam]] and settled in Antwerp, continued this latter theme contemporaneous with developments of [[marine painting]] in the Dutch Republic.

Interior architectural views, usually of churches, developed out of the late sixteenth-century works of [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]]. Many were actual locations. [[Pieter Neeffs I]], for example, made numerous interiors of the [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp]]. [[Hendrik van Steenwijk II]], on the other hand, followed Vredeman's precedent in painting imaginary interiors. The genre continued in the later seventeenth century by [[Anton Ghering]] and [[Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg]], but the Flemish examples do not demonstrate the same level of innovation found in the Dutch perspectives of [[Pieter Jansz Saenredam]] or [[Emanuel de Witte]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe200"&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 200–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gallery and art collection painting==
Gallery paintings appeared in Antwerp around 1610, and developed—like architectural interiors—from the compositions of [[Hans Vredeman de Vries]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest innovators of this new genre was [[Frans Francken the Younger]], who introduced the type of work known as the ''Preziosenwand'' (wall of treasures). In these, prints, paintings, sculptures, drawings, as well as collectable objects from the natural world like shells and flowers are collected together in the foreground against a wall that imitates encyclopedic [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]]. A similar variation of these collections of artistic wealth are the series of the [[sense|five senses]] created by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] and Rubens ([[Prado Museum]], [[Madrid]]). [[Willem van Haecht]] (1593–1637) developed another variation in which illustrations of actual artworks are displayed in a fantasy art gallery, while connoisseurs and art lovers admire them. Later in the century, [[David Teniers the Younger]], working in the capacity of court painter to [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria]], documented the archduke's collection of Italian paintings in Brussels as gallery painters as well as in a printed catalogue–the ''[[Theatrum Pictorium]]''. Flemish Gallery and art collection paintings have been interpreted as a kind of visual theory of art.&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 202–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Such paintings continued to be made in Antwerp by [[Gerard Thomas]] (1663–1721) and [[Balthasar van den Bossche]] (1681–1715), and foreshadow the development of the [[veduta]] in Italy and the galleries of [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]].

==Still life and animal painting==

===Flower painting===
[[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] was one of the important innovators of the floral still life around 1600.&lt;ref name="vlieghe207"/&gt; These paintings, which presented immaculately observed arrangements and compositions, were imaginary creations of  flowers that bloom at different times of the years.&lt;ref name="vlieghe207" /&gt; They were popular with leading patrons and nobility across Europe, and generally have an underlying [[Vanitas]] motif. The compositions of Brueghel's paintings were also influential on later Dutch flower pieces.&lt;ref name="vlieghe208"&gt;Vlieghe, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Brueghel's sons [[Jan Brueghel the Younger]] and [[Ambrosius Brueghel]] were also flower specialists. [[Osias Beert]] (1580–1624) was another flower painter at the beginning of the 17th century. His paintings share many similarities with northern contemporaries such as [[Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder]].&lt;ref name="vlieghe208" /&gt;

===Garland painting===
Closely related to the flower still life is the flower garland genre of painting that was invented by Jan Brueghel in collaboration with [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] [[Federico Borromeo]] in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;David Freedberg, "The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion", ''Münchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst'', xxxii, 1981, pp. 115–150.&lt;/ref&gt; The early versions of these paintings, such as the collaboration by Breughel and Rubens in Munich ([[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]]) show the [[Virgin Mary]] and [[Christ]] child surrounded by a garland of flowers. They have been interpreted as distinctly Counter Reformation images, with the flowers emphasizing the delicacy of the Virgin and Child–images of which were destroyed in large numbers during the [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] outbreaks of 1566.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg (1981), ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Brueghel's student, the [[Jesuit]] painter [[Daniel Seghers]], also painted many of these types of works for an international clientele.&lt;ref name="vlieghe209"&gt;Vlieghe, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; In later versions, the fleshy Madonna and Child gave way to sculptural niches and even pagan themes.
[[File:Osias Beert - Oysters 1610.jpg|thumb|right|Osias Beert, ''Still life with oysters'', ''c''. 1610. Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart. Beert's still lifes are typical of the "breakfast" type painted early in the 17th century.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;]]

===Breakfast and banquet still life===
The ''ontbijtje'', or "little breakfast", is a type of still life that was popular in both the northern and southern Netherlands showing a variety of eating and drinking vessels and foods such as cheese and bread against a neutral background. [[Osias Beert]], [[Clara Peeters]], [[Cornelis Mahu]] and [[Jacob Foppens van Es]] (''c''. 1596–1666) were all artists who made these types of painting. More elaborate are the ''pronk'', or "sumptuous", still life. This style developed in the Dutch Republic, and was brought to Antwerp by [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]]. They show, on a larger scale than earlier works, complex compositions of expensive items, rare foods, and fleshy, peeling fruit. These paintings are related to [[vanitas]] and transience motifs.

[[File:Frans SNYDERS, The Pantry.JPG|thumb|left|Frans Snyders, ''The Pantry'', ''c''. 1620.]]

===Animal still life===
[[Frans Snyders]] (1579–1657) painted large still lifes focusing on dead game and animals. His compositions, along with those of his follower [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] (1599–1652). look back to the sixteenth-century paintings of [[Pieter Aertsen]] and [[Joachim Beuckelaer]], but instill that tradition with a High Baroque monumentality.&lt;ref name="vlieghe211"&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 211–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent artists, [[Jan Fyt]] and [[Pieter Boel]] further elaborated on this type by including a noticeable mixture of living animals and dead game. These latter paintings are closely related to images of the hunt, which came into fashion in Flemish painting during the 17th century.

[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 110.jpg|thumb|right|Peter Paul Rubens, ''Tiger and Lion Hunt'', ''c''. 1617–1618. Musée des Beaux Arts, Rennes. This painting is typical of Rubens's "exotic" hunts painted between about 1615 and 1625.]]

==Hunting scenes==
Rubens introduced the monumental hunt to Flemish art, depicting on a large scale a close battle inspired by his study of classical antiquity and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|Battle of Anghiari]]''. These works show both noble hunts, such as the ''Wolf and Fox Hunt'' ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]), and exotic hunts, such as the ''Lion Hunt'' ([[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]]). [[Frans Snyders]] and [[Paul de Vos]] created similarly large paintings which are 
distinct from Rubens's works in their focus on the animals and absence of human participation.

==Cabinet painting==
Small, intricate paintings, usually depicting history and biblical subjects, were produced in great numbers in the Southern Netherlands throughout the 17th century. Many were created by anonymous artists, however artists such as [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], [[Hendrik van Balen]], [[Frans Francken the Younger]] and [[Hendrik de Clerck]] were all successful [[cabinet painting|cabinet painters]] during the first half of the 17th century. These artists, as well as followers of [[Adam Elsheimer]] like [[David Teniers the Elder]], remained partly shaped by continued mannerist stylistic tendencies. However, Rubens influenced a number of later artists who incorporated his Baroque style into the small context of these works. Among them are [[Frans Wouters]], [[Jan Thomas van Ieperen]], [[Simon de Vos]], [[Pieter van Lint]], and [[Willem van Herp]]. These small paintings were traded widely throughout Europe, and by way of Spain to [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;Vlieghe, pp. 105–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6817">The '''Generation of '38''' ({{lang-es|'''Generación del 38'''}}) was a [[Chile]]an artistic-literary movement that tried to portray the social decline of the time in its works. It became prominent in the cultural panorama of the 1930s.

==Historical context==
In 1937, after two mandates by [[Arturo Alessandri|Arturo Alessandri Palma]], the [[Popular Front (Chile)|Popular Front]] took over the Chilean government. The international situation was critical, marked by the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939) and by the imminent outbreak of [[World War II]] (1939–1945). This affected conditions for the majority of the population.&lt;ref name=Mansilla&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-74264.html |title=La Generación del 38 |last=Mansilla |first=Luis Alberto |language=Spanish |access-date=8 May 2017 |via=Memoria Chilena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic context==
Chile was undergoing a process of economic transition, as its main source of livelihood was the agricultural sector, but interest in industrialization was growing. This had dire consequences for the mining sector, as production of [[saltpeter]] ceased, and consequently many unemployed northern miners decided to travel to the capital in search of new job opportunities.

==Characteristics of the group==
Due to the great social turmoil resulting from the global crisis, some young Chilean writers felt the need to reflect what they saw around them in their works. In particular they detailed the deplorable conditions in which miners and laborers worked, and how this situation extended to their families – because the jobs paid poorly, scarcity and misery were common in daily life.

Facing this great social problem, various writers and artists wanted to bring literature and the arts closer to the reality of the Chilean working and middle classes. In the Generation of '38, interest in social issues was united with the idea of creating an intellectual and artistic movement. This contrasted with earlier years in which culture was not a transcendent part of Chilean social life because literature and other forms of art did not reflect the reality of life in the country.

The Generation of '38 was not only a literary movement, but also extended to other areas of culture. During the 1940s the experimental theater of the [[University of Chile]] and the Symphony Orchestra were created. In this way, both theater and music ensured that interest in the social question transcended the literary sphere and became a relevant theme for Chilean culture of the time.&lt;ref name=Mansilla/&gt;

An example of the themes that were addressed in the literature of the time is the narrative of [[Nicomedes Guzmán]] (1914–1964) in his work ''Los hombres oscuros'', where he alludes to the vicissitudes of a man living in a tenement and how he decides to become part of a [[trade union]] movement.&lt;ref name=Mansilla/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pqC4AAAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=oscuros |title=Nicomedes Guzmán, proletarian author in Chile's literary generation of 1938 |last=Pearson |first=Lon |publisher=[[University of Missouri Press]] |isbn=9780826201782 |page=15 |year=1976 |access-date=8 May 2017 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of literature that Guzmán created was that of a "pamphleteer" character, since in his works there was an implicit call to workers to mobilize and organize themselves to promote awareness of their problems and jointly seek certain improvements.

Another author who was interested in social problems was [[Volodia Teitelboim]] (1916–2008), whose works portrayed how [[capitalism]] affects the poor conditions in which poor and middle class Chileans live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=La Novela chilena del último siglo |last=Promis Ojeda |first=José |publisher=Editorial La Noria |location=Santiago, Chile |language=Spanish |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Intervención en el Segundo Encuentro de Escritores |last=Teitelboim |first=Volodia |author-link=Volodia Teitelboim |journal=[[Atenea]] |number=380-381 |publisher=[[University of Concepción]] |location=Concepción, Chile |language=Spanish |year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is how she referred to the birth of the Generation of '38:
{{Quote|The novice writers put something of our soul into that fight and we feel part of the populace. We were driven by a passionate and vague eagerness to change the national life, to give the worker and the peasant and also the writer and the artist a place of dignity under the sun, to create an atmosphere where poetry would occupy a golden chair in the proscenium. We wanted to impose scales of values in which intelligence, the spirit of sacrifice for beauty, the people and the country would replace the rotten government of the opulent, spiritually exhausted, uneducated, mediocre and empty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ejWnNZx8cMsC&amp;pg=PR15&amp;lpg=PR15 |title=Obra narrativa selecta |last1=Alegría |first1=Fernando |last2=Epple |first2=Juan Armando |publisher=Fundacion Biblioteca Ayacuch |isbn=9789802763528 |language=Spanish |page=XV |date=1 January 2002 |access-date=8 May 2017 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The novelist [[Carlos Droguett]] (1912–1996) tells in one of his chronicles of the deaths of some young people who participated in a protest in the Seguro Obrero building in 1938. In his 1966 autobiography he affirmed: "Seguro Obrero shook me deeply and made me aware of my capacity to hate."

In short, many of the works created by writers belonging to the Generation of '38 were tools to express  their discontent with the working conditions and misery experienced by most Chileans.

'''Jessica Thom''' (born 14 July 1980) is a British theatre-maker and comedian best known for Touretteshero, an alter-ego and project aimed at increasing awareness of [[Tourette syndrome|Tourette's Syndrome,]] the neurological condition which she was diagnosed with in her early twenties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jul/09/jess-thom-tourettes-hero-comedy|title=Jess Thom AKA Touretteshero: comedy at its most unpredictable|last=Caird|first=Jo|date=2014-07-09|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Touretteshero production, ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'' debuted at [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] in 2014.

== Early/personal life ==
Thom was born in London. She experienced involuntary vocal and physical tics throughout her childhood as a result of Tourette's Syndrome, but was not diagnosed with the condition until her early twenties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thom has recurring vocal tics, the most common of which is the word 'biscuit' which she can utter up to 16,000 times a day.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/18/backstage-in-biscuit-land-review-tourettes-makes-for-unpredictable-joyous-must-watch-theatre|title=Backstage in Biscuit Land review – Tourette's makes for unpredictable, joyous, must-watch theatre|last=Harmon|first=Steph|date=2016-10-18|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a younger sister, who Jess previously referred to as 'Fat Sister' in a vocal tic whilst she was dieting. Thom acknowledges that her condition presents challenges but seeks to avoid 'self-pity or mockery' and to 'celebrate the creativity and humour of Tourette's'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.touretteshero.com/faq/|title=FAQ|newspaper=Touretteshero|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to guidance notes for journalists written by the team at Touretteshero, and published by the Guardian:&lt;blockquote&gt;Although some aspects of [Tourette's Syndrome] are challenging, Jess does not describe herself as a 'Tourette's sufferer' under any circumstances. Instead she likes to be referred to as a 'person with Tourette's' or as simply as 'having Tourette's'. She is 'brave' for all sorts of reasons, but not because she is disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/29/challenging-stereotypes-about-tourette-syndrome|title=Challenging stereotypes about Tourette syndrome|date=2016-02-29|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-21|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thom has stated that she finds herself talking about and explaining Tourette's everyday in her day-to-day interactions: "It doesn't always feel like a choice, more a tool for living...Often this is very functional, like explaining at the start of a phone call that I have Tourettes, answering a question or addressing sniggers on public transport."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exeuntmagazine.com/features/reclaiming-cultural-spaces-a-dialogue/|title=Reclaiming Cultural Spaces: A Dialogue - Exeunt Magazine|website=exeuntmagazine.com|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thom regularly experiences discrimination as a result of having Tourette's. She has recounted one particularly bad experience in multiple interviews, when she went to see comedian [[Mark Thomas]] perform at Tricycle Theatre.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/09/backstage-in-biscuit-land-edinburgh-festival-2014-review-tourettes|title=Edinburgh festival 2014 review: Backstage in Biscuit Land – Tourette's and theatre make a joyous combo|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=2014-08-09|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other audience members complained about the noise she was making as a result of her vocal tics and the venue's staff asked her to move into a sound booth, so she wouldn't be heard by other customers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although initially the experience made her vow never to go to the theatre again, it eventually became the catalyst for her becoming a performer: "The creative way to respond was to occupy that space as an artist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=British Council Arts|title=Jess Thom on accessibility and Dublin Theatre Festival 2016 (audio described)|date=2017-01-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHKQJ_V2lLs|accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thom is also a wheelchair user. Following the [[social model of disability]], Thom sees most of the challenges she faces not as a result of her unique neurology and physical impairment, but as a result of the 'disabling barriers' created by society, telling BBC News in 2014: "My wheelchair and my tics are not the thing that disables me; the thing that disables me is the inaccessible environment".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=BBC News|title=What is freedom?

Thom studied at the [[Royal College of Art]], London, graduating in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/performance-and-music/jess-thom-touretteshero|title=Jess Thom: Touretteshero - Performance at Tate Modern {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Early career ===

Prior to becoming a theatre-maker and performer, Thom's career began as a playworker, working with children and young people. She has also been a fundraiser and project coordinator at a charity based in south London.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Touretteshero ===

In 2010, Thom and longstanding friend and collaborator Matthew Pountney co-founded Touretteshero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.touretteshero.com/about/|title=About Touretteshero|newspaper=Touretteshero|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea started out as a way of engaging people with the creative and humorous side of Tourette's, with Thom dressing up in a superhero costume and delivering performances and workshops, especially to children and young people. In 2011, Thom appeared on Episode 3, 'Uses and Abuses' of [[Stephen Fry]]'s five-part BBC series [[Fry's Planet Word]], to discuss her Tourette's and [[coprolalia]] - the involuntary use of swear words which 10% of people with Tourette's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Touretteshero|title=Fry's Planet Word - Touretteshero|date=2011-10-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOwPaBDFDi4|accessdate=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01614w9|title=Uses and Abuses, Fry's Planet Word - BBC Two|website=BBC|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Souvenir Press published ''Welcome to Biscuit Land: A year in the life of Touretteshero'' based on entries on Thom's blog, for which Fry wrote the foreword.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Welcome-Biscuit-Land-year-Touretteshero-ebook/dp/B009K19DL2/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487761070&amp;sr=1-2|title=Welcome to Biscuit Land: A year in the life of Touretteshero|last=Thom|first=Jessica|last2=Fry|first2=Mrs Stephen|date=2012-09-29|publisher=Souvenir Press|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Touretteshero has also put on creative events, like 'We Forgot The Lot!' - a collaboration with [[Tate]] for children and young people with and without Tourette's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/special-event/we-forgot-lot|title=We forgot the lot! - Special Event at Tate Britain {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Backstage in Biscuit Land ===

Partly inspired by her negative experience of attending the Mark Thomas gig, and taking its name from Thom's most common vocal tic 'biscuit', ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'' began development as a theatre piece which explores the creative opportunities of Thom's tics and also other people's reaction to them. In 2013, Thom met performer and puppeteer, Jess Mabel Jones at a performance of ''Beauty and the Beast'' by ONEOFUS ([[Mat Fraser]] and [[Julie Atlas Muz]]) in London.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mabel Jones would later become a lead collaborator on ''Backstage in Biscuit Land''. Mabel Jones's role in this 'one-woman show for two' is to make sure Thom doesn't stray too far off topic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to Thom's unique and sporadic ticcing, which is riffed on heavily in the show, no two performances are quite the same. The set for the show features 50 items that were the subjects of some of Thom's spontaneous vocal tics during the development cycle, including a 'babygrow for Les Dennis' and 'ducks dressed as pterodactyls'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Backstage in Biscuit Land'' received R&amp;D funding from commissioning body Unlimited,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://weareunlimited.org.uk/commission/touretteshero/|title=Touretteshero - Unlimited|newspaper=Unlimited|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; but crowdfunding was sought to help bring the show to Edinburgh Fringe Festival.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reviews of the initial run at Edinburgh were very positive. Lyn Gardiner in ''The Guardian'' said: "Jess Thom's condition lends her show an absurdist edge Samuel Beckett would be proud of...Tourette's and theatre make a joyous combo". She also described it as "extraordinarily entertaining" awarding it four stars.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Alice Jones in ''The Independent'' said: "The humour is black but it's also daft and uplifting, and in places, impossibly moving".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/edinburgh-festival/backstage-in-biscuit-land-pleasance-courtyard-review-remarkable-tourettes-inspired-comedy-9651503.html|title=Backstage in Biscuit Land, Pleasance Courtyard, review: Remarkable|date=2014-08-06|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV Bomb, were perhaps most effusive with their praise declaring: "There are more ideas and imagination in this one hour show than most of the Fringe programme combined," awarding it 5 out of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvbomb.co.uk/review/backstage-in-biscuit-land/|title=Review: Backstage in Biscuit Land: Pleasance Courtyard: Edinburgh: 5 Bombs|newspaper=TV Bomb {{!}} Reviews and Opinion|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its success at Edinburgh, ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'' went on a tour across the UK throughout 2015 and 2016 including a notable performance at the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican]], London. It continued to pick up glowing reviews with ''The Stage'' awarding it four stars and calling the show "a properly joyous thing, funny, informative, and eloquent about the need for theatre to be more accessible to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/backstage-biscuit-land-review-barbican-pit-celebratory-show/|title=Backstage in Biscuit Land review at Barbican Pit – 'a celebratory show' {{!}} Review {{!}} Theatre {{!}} The Stage|newspaper=The Stage|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadway Baby also awarded the show 4 stars "This show is one big tasty biscuit all right".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://broadwaybaby.com/shows/backstage-in-biscuit-land/706927|title=Backstage in Biscuit Land|website=Broadway Baby|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2016 the production went international with a tour of North America which included performances at New York's BRIC, Toronto's Harbourfront, San Francisco's International Arts Festival and Los Angeles' Skirball Cultural Center. Performances in Australia included at the Sydney Opera House,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/whatson/kath17-backstage-in-biscuit-land.aspx|title=BACKSTAGE IN BISCUIT LAND|website=Sydney Opera House|language=en|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queensland Performing Arts Centre, Brisbane and Melbourne International Festival. The performance at the latter earned the show 4 stars in the Australian edition of ''The Guardian,'' with Steph Harmon describing at as "unpredictable, joyous, must-watch theatre".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Media appearances ===

Thom appeared on ITV's ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'' in May 2012 and was interviewed at length by [[Phillip Schofield]] and [[Holly Willoughby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=mjp221972|title=Jess Thom Tourettes Hero Interview This Morning 2012|date=2012-05-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyav2KHZP_g|accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, Thom appeared on RTE's Saturday Night Show with [[Brendan O'Connor (media personality)|Brendan O'Connor]]. In September of that year, Thom delivered a talk about the misconceptions of Tourette's Syndrome at TEDxAlbertopolis, the first [[TED (conference)|TED]] event to take place at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/7663|title=TEDxAlbertopolis {{!}} TED.com|website=www.ted.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her appearance on Fry's Planet Word in 2014, Thom appeared on Radio 4's [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|The Today Programme]], discussing Tourette's and [[BBC News]] discussing her ideas about 'freedom' later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9714000/9714435.stm|title=BBC News - Today - My Tourette's tics are really funny|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In October 2015, Thom was interviewed on BBC's ''[[Russell Howard's Good News|Russel Howard's Good News]],'' with the broadcast apparently reaching some 3 million people.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://disabilityarts.online/magazine/opinion/jess-thom-on-taking-biscuit-land-to-the-small-screen/|title=Jess Thom on taking Biscuit Land to the small screen - Disability Arts Online|newspaper=Disability Arts Online|access-date=2017-02-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next month a version of ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'', adapted for television entitled ''Broadcast from Biscuit Land'' had a 30-minute slot on BBC4's Live from Television Centre, the first live broadcast from Television Centre since the building was decommissioned in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/tvc-theatre|title=BBC - BBC announces return to Television Centre for live theatre broadcast - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Thom appeared on series 10 of Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.comedy.co.uk/podcasts/richard_herring_lst_podcast/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Touretteshero won the 2014 Total Theatre Award, Best Emerging Company for ''Backstage in Biscuit Land''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edfringe.com/media/news/total-theatre-award-winners-announced|title=Total Theatre Award winners announced {{!}} Edinburgh Festival Fringe|website=www.edfringe.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Disability Activism ==
Thom is an outspoken advocate of disabled people's rights. Her personal outlook often inverts the typical negative stereotypes associated with disability, for instance she sees her Tourette's as a source of creativity and her wheelchair as a symbol of freedom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She advocates for empowerment of disabled people via the social model of disability, telling Exeunt: &lt;blockquote&gt;As a society there are still lots of people who think about disability solely in negative terms. The medical model – 'disabled people are broken and need to be fixed' – and the charity model – 'tragic and in need of help' – are ways of conceptualizing disability that remain widespread even though the social model of disability – 'people are disabled by a failure to consider difference' – underpins our legislation and public services.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Following her own negative experiences of attending the theatre, Thom has campaigned to get more 'relaxed performances' (a performance where the audience are allowed to make noise and move around, which is more suitable for certain neurodiverse people) in theatres, as well as making every performance of ''Backstage in Biscuit Land'' a relaxed performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-relaxed-performance-20160530-snap-story.html|title=The theater world is opening its arms to people with Tourette's and autism|last=Greiving|first=Tim|website=latimes.com|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thom has also been an outspoken critic of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]]'s cuts to provision for disabled people, telling Disability Arts Online:&lt;blockquote&gt;So many of the structures that were in place to support disabled people to live independent lives have been dismantled in recent years. Ambitions are being capped because of the structures designed to disable and limit what we have access to. There is a big difference between having basic needs met and having the right to an independent life. With the abolition of the Independent Living Fund and Access to Work and all the other attacks on disabled peoples' rights our only option is to keep fighting.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Jesse Kalisher''' (June 22, 1962 – July 20, 2017) was an American art photographer.&lt;ref name="kalisher"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kalisher.com/about.html |title=Hospitality Art |publisher=Kalisher |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021084903/http://www.kalisher.com/about.html |archivedate=2012-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Jesse Kalisher was barely six years old when he received his first camera. It was a birthday gift from his father, the photographer Simpson Kalisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston |url=http://www.mfah.org/exhibitions/past/simpson-kalisher-alienated-photographer |title=Exhibitions &amp;#124; Simpson Kalisher: The Alienated Photographer |publisher=MFAH |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124041407/http://www.mfah.org/exhibitions/past/simpson-kalisher-alienated-photographer/ |archivedate=2012-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simpsonkalisher.com/info_pages/credits_01.html |title=Credits |publisher=Simpson Kalisher |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226035932/http://www.simpsonkalisher.com/info_pages/credits_01.html |archivedate=2011-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Jesse was raised by his mother Ilse, he worked with Simpson in the darkroom and later served as his assistant.&lt;ref name="kalisher" /&gt;

Despite his early interest in photography, Kalisher embarked on a decade long career in marketing and advertising, working for companies including [[BBDO]], Grey Advertising, The Clorox Company, and [[J. Walter Thompson]]. Unfulfilled, he decided to leave the industry and spend a few months traveling. During a trip to Vietnam, Kalisher rediscovered his passion for photography, propelling him down the path to a new career as a fine art photographer.&lt;ref name="digitalphotopro"&gt;{{cite web|last=Willis |first=David |url=http://www.digitalphotopro.com/profiles/jesse-kalisher-world-traveler.html |title=Jesse Kalisher: World Traveler |publisher=DigitalPhotoPro.com |date=2011-04-26 |accessdate=2012-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108073814/http://www.digitalphotopro.com/profiles/jesse-kalisher-world-traveler.html |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy''' is awarded once a year by the [[Inamori Foundation]] for lifetime achievements in the arts and philosophy. The Prize is one of three [[Kyoto Prize]] categories; the others are the [[Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology]] and the [[Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences]]. The first Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy was awarded to [[Olivier Messiaen]] in 1985, the "greatest composer to have emerged from 20th century France".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olivier Messiaen|url=http://www.kyotoprize.org/en/laureates/olivier_messiaen/|publisher=Inamori Foundation|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prize is widely regarded as the most prestigious award available in fields which are traditionally not honored with a [[Nobel Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kyoto Prize honors achievement and character|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/columnist/vergano/2006-11-12-kyoto-prize_x.htm|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=1 January 2013|date=11 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Landscape Near Beauvais''''' is a 1740s oil on canvas painting by [[François Boucher]], now in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in St Petersburg.

It shows a landscape near [[Beauvais]] and is signed bottom right "F. Boucher". Its dating is based on similarities to later works produced by the artist whilst working at the [[Beauvais Manufactory]] (1743-1755). The catalogue of the 1740 [[Paris Salon]] mentions "A landscape ... in which a mill can be seen" and that for 1743 "A landscape with a water mill". A canvas was painted in 1743 as a pendant to the work now in the Hermitage. It is also mentioned in the catalogue of the 1743 Salon as "Its Pendant", showing an old tower.

A drawing precisely copying the left side of the painting is now in the [[Rijksmuseum]]&lt;ref&gt;Harold Joachim, ''The Helen Regenstein Collection of European drawings : catalogue'', Chicago, Art Institute of Chicago, 1974, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the mid 18th century the Hermitage painting was part of the Lenoir collection and at the start of the 20th century of the Olive collection in [[St Petersburg]]. It entered the Hermitage in 1923. It was transferred to Moscow in 1925 as part of the collections of the Museum of Western Art, located in the former town house of [[Sergei Shchukin]], before returning to the Hermitage in 1930.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19362">{{Lie groups |Algebras}}

Towards the end of the nineteenth century, [[Sophus Lie]] introduced the notion of [[Lie group]] in order to study the solutions of [[ordinary differential equations]]&lt;ref name="Lie1881"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lie1890"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lie1893"/&gt; (ODEs). He showed the following main property: the order of an ordinary differential equation can be reduced by one if it is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under one-parameter Lie group of [[point transformation]]s.&lt;ref name="Olver1993"/&gt; This observation unified and extended the available integration techniques. Lie devoted the remainder of his mathematical career to developing these [[continuous group]]s that have now an impact on many areas of mathematically based sciences. The applications of Lie groups to [[differential system]]s were mainly established by Lie and [[Emmy Noether]], and then advocated by [[Élie Cartan]].

Roughly speaking, a Lie point symmetry of a system is a local group of transformations that maps every solution of the system to another solution of the same system. In other words, it maps the solution set of the system to itself. Elementary examples of Lie groups are [[Translation (geometry)|translations]], [[rotations]] and [[Scaling (geometry)|scalings]].

The Lie symmetry theory is a well-known subject. In it are discussed [[continuous symmetry|continuous symmetries]] opposed to, for example, [[discrete symmetry|discrete symmetries]]. The literature for this theory can be found, among other places, in these notes.&lt;ref name="Olver1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olver1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BlumanKumei1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephani1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeviWinternitz2006"/&gt;

== Overview ==

=== Types of symmetries ===
Lie groups and hence their infinitesimal generators can be naturally "extended" to act on the space of independent variables, [[state variable]]s (dependent variables) and derivatives of the state variables up to any finite order. There are many other kinds of symmetries. For example, [[contact geometry|contact transformations]] let coefficients of the transformations infinitesimal generator depend also on first derivatives of the coordinates. [[Lie-Bäcklund transformation]]s let them involve derivatives up to an arbitrary order. The possibility of the existence of such symmetries was recognized by Noether.&lt;ref name="Noether1918"/&gt; For Lie point symmetries, the coefficients of the infinitesimal generators depend only on coordinates, denoted by &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Applications ===
Lie symmetries were introduced by Lie in order to solve ordinary differential equations. Another application of symmetry methods is to reduce systems of differential equations, finding equivalent systems of differential equations of simpler form. This is called [[Reduction (mathematics)|reduction]]. In the literature, one can find the classical reduction process,&lt;ref name="Olver1993"/&gt; and the [[moving frame]]-based reduction process.&lt;ref name="Cartan1935"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FelsOlver1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FelsOlver1999"/&gt; Also symmetry groups can be used for classifying different symmetry classes of solutions.

== Geometrical framework ==

=== Infinitesimal approach ===
Lie's fundamental theorems underline that Lie groups can be characterized by elements known as ''infinitesimal generators''. These mathematical objects form a [[Lie algebra]] of infinitesimal generators. Deduced "infinitesimal symmetry conditions" (defining equations of the symmetry group) can be explicitly solved in order to find the closed form of symmetry groups, and thus the associated infinitesimal generators.

Let &lt;math&gt;Z=(z_1,\dots,z_n)&lt;/math&gt; be the set of coordinates on which a system is defined where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the cardinal of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. An infinitesimal generator &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; in the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}(Z)&lt;/math&gt; is a linear operator &lt;math&gt;\delta : \mathbb{R}(Z)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}(Z)&lt;/math&gt; that has &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; in its kernel and that satisfies the [[Product rule|Leibniz rule]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall (f_1,f_2) \in \mathbb{R}(Z)^2, \delta f_1 f_2 = f_1 \delta f_2 + f_2 \delta f_1&lt;/math&gt;.
In the canonical basis of elementary derivations &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial z_1},\dots,\frac{\partial}{\partial z_n}\right \}&lt;/math&gt;, it is written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \xi_{z_i}(Z) \frac{\partial}{\partial z_i}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\xi_{z_i}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}(Z)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\left\{1,\dots,n\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Lie groups and Lie algebras of infinitesimal generators ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}

[[Lie algebra]]s can be generated by a generating set of infinitesimal generators as defined above. To every Lie group, one can associate a Lie algebra. Roughly, a Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[algebra]] constituted by a vector space equipped with [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]] as additional operation. The base field of a Lie algebra depends on the concept of [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]. Here only finite-dimensional Lie algebras are considered.

=== Continuous dynamical systems ===

A [[dynamical system]] (or [[Flow (mathematics)|flow]]) is a one-parameter [[group action]]. Let us denote by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; such a dynamical system, more precisely, a (left-)action of a group &lt;math&gt;(G,+)&lt;/math&gt; on a [[manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rccc}
\mathcal{D} : &amp; G\times M &amp; \rightarrow &amp; M \\
&amp; \nu \times Z &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \mathcal{D}(\nu,Z)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
such that for all point &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;:
* &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}(e,Z)=Z&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the neutral element of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;;
* for all &lt;math&gt;(\nu, \hat{\nu})&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}(\nu,\mathcal{D}(\hat{\nu},Z))=\mathcal{D}(\nu+\hat{\nu},Z)&lt;/math&gt;.

A continuous dynamical system is defined on a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that can be identified to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. the group elements are continuous.

=== Invariants ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}

An [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]], roughly speaking, is an element that does not change under a transformation.

== Definition of Lie point symmetries ==

In this paragraph, we consider precisely ''expanded Lie point symmetries'' i.e. we work in an expanded space meaning that the distinction between independent variable, state variables and parameters are avoided as much as possible.

A symmetry group of a system is a continuous dynamical system defined on a local Lie group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acting on a manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. For the sake of clarity, we restrict ourselves to n-dimensional real manifolds &lt;math&gt;M=\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of system coordinates.

=== Lie point symmetries of algebraic systems ===

Let us define [[algebraic system]]s used in the forthcoming symmetry definition.

==== Algebraic systems ====

Let &lt;math&gt;F=(f_1,\dots,f_k)=(p_1/q_1,\dots,p_k/q_k)&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set of rational functions over the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; are polynomials in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}[Z]&lt;/math&gt; i.e. in variables &lt;math&gt;Z=(z_1,\dots,z_n)&lt;/math&gt; with coefficients in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. An ''algebraic system'' associated to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the following equalities and inequalities:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{ccc}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
p_1(Z)= 0, \\
\vdots \\
p_k(Z)=0
\end{array}
\right.&amp; \mbox{and} &amp;
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
q_1(Z) \neq 0, \\
\vdots \\
q_k(Z) \neq 0.
\end{array}
\right.
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

An algebraic system defined by &lt;math&gt;F=(f_1,\dots,f_k)&lt;/math&gt; is ''regular'' (a.k.a. [[Smooth algebraic variety|smooth]]) if the system &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is of maximal rank &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that the [[Jacobian matrix]] &lt;math&gt;(\partial f_i / \partial z_j)&lt;/math&gt; is of rank &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; at every solution &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; of the associated semi-algebraic [[algebraic variety|variety]].

==== Definition of Lie point symmetries ====

The following theorem (see th. 2.8 in ch.2 of &lt;ref name="Olver1995"/&gt;) gives necessary and sufficient conditions so that a local Lie group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetry group of an algebraic system.

'''Theorem'''. Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a connected local Lie group of a continuous dynamical system acting in the n-dimensional space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;F: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;k \leq n&lt;/math&gt; define a regular system of algebraic equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
f_i(Z)=0 \quad \forall i \in \{1,\dots,k\}.
&lt;/math&gt;
Then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetry group of this algebraic system if, and only if,
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta f_i(Z)=0 \quad \forall i\in \{1,\dots,k\} \mbox{ whenever } f_1(Z)=\dots=f_k(Z)=0
&lt;/math&gt;
for every infinitesimal generator &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; in the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Example ====
Let us consider the algebraic system defined on a space of 6 variables, namely &lt;math&gt;Z=(P,Q,a,b,c,l)&lt;/math&gt; with:
:&lt;math&gt;
\left \{
\begin{array}{l}
f_1(Z)=(1-cP)+bQ + 1, \\
f_2(Z)=aP - lQ +1.
\end{array}
\right .
&lt;/math&gt;

The infinitesimal generator
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta = a(a-1) \dfrac{\partial}{\partial a} + (l+b)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial b}+ (2ac-c)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial c}+(-aP+P)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial P}
&lt;/math&gt;
is associated to one of the one-parameter symmetry groups. It acts on 4 variables, namely &lt;math&gt;a,b,c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. One can easily verify that &lt;math&gt;\delta f_1 = f_1 -f_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta f_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the relations &lt;math&gt;\delta f_1 = \delta f_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; are satisfied for any &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^6&lt;/math&gt; that vanishes the algebraic system.

=== Lie point symmetries of dynamical systems ===

Let us define systems of first-order [[ordinary differential equations|ODEs]] used in the forthcoming symmetry definition.

==== Systems of ODEs and associated infinitesimal generators ====

Let &lt;math&gt;d\cdot / dt&lt;/math&gt; be a derivation w.r.t. the continuous independent variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. We consider two sets &lt;math&gt;X=(x_1,\dots,x_k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Theta = (\theta_1,\dots,\theta_l)&lt;/math&gt;. The associated coordinate set is defined by &lt;math&gt;Z=(z_1,\dots,z_n)=(t,x_1,\dots,x_k,\theta_1,\dots,\theta_l)&lt;/math&gt; and its cardinal is &lt;math&gt;n=1+k+l&lt;/math&gt;. With these notations, a ''system of first-order ODEs'' is a system where:
:&lt;math&gt;
\left \{
\begin{array}{l}
\dfrac{d x_i}{dt} = f_i(Z) \mbox{ with } f_i \in \mathbb{R}(Z) \quad \forall i \in \{1,\dots,k\}, \\
\dfrac{d \theta_j}{dt} = 0 \quad \forall j \in \{1,\dots,l\}
\end{array}
\right .
&lt;/math&gt;
and the set &lt;math&gt;F=(f_1,\dots,f_k)&lt;/math&gt; specifies the evolution of state variables of ODEs w.r.t. the independent variable. The elements of the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are called ''state variables'', these of &lt;math&gt;\Theta&lt;/math&gt; ''parameters''.

One can associate also a continuous dynamical system to a system of ODEs by resolving its equations.

An infinitesimal generator is a derivation that is closely related to systems of ODEs (more precisely to continuous dynamical systems). For the link between a system of ODEs, the associated vector field and the infinitesimal generator, see section 1.3 of.&lt;ref name="Olver1993"/&gt; The infinitesimal generator &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; associated to a system of ODEs, described as above, is defined with the same notations as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial t} + \sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(Z) \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i}\cdot
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Definition of Lie point symmetries ====

Here is a geometrical definition of such symmetries. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; be a continuous dynamical system and &lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; its infinitesimal generator. A continuous dynamical system &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie point symmetry of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; if, and only if, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; sends every orbit of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; to an orbit. Hence, the infinitesimal generator &lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the following relation&lt;ref name="Stephani1989"/&gt; based on [[Lie bracket]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
[\delta_\mathcal{D}, \delta_\mathcal{S}] = \lambda \delta_\mathcal{D}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is any constant of &lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; i.e. &lt;math&gt;\delta_\mathcal{D}\lambda = \delta_\mathcal{S} \lambda = 0&lt;/math&gt;. These generators are linearly independent.

One does not need the explicit formulas of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; in order to compute the infinitesimal generators of its symmetries.

=== Example ===

Consider [[Pierre François Verhulst]]'s [[logistic growth]] model with linear predation,&lt;ref name="Murray2002"/&gt; where the state variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; represents a population. The parameter &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the difference between the growth and predation rate and the parameter &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the receptive capacity of the environment:
:&lt;math&gt;
\dfrac{dx}{dt}= (a-bx)x, \dfrac{da}{dt}=\dfrac{db}{dt}=0.
&lt;/math&gt;

The continuous dynamical system associated to this system of ODEs is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rccc}
\mathcal{D}: &amp; (\mathbb{R},+) \times \mathbb{R}^4 &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \mathbb{R}^4 \\
&amp; (\hat{t},(t,x,a,b)) &amp; \rightarrow &amp; \left(t+\hat{t}, \frac{axe^{a\hat{t}}}{a-(1-e^{a\hat{t}})bx}, a, b\right).
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
The independent variable &lt;math&gt;\hat{t}&lt;/math&gt; varies continuously; thus the associated group can be identified with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

The infinitesimal generator associated to this system of ODEs is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_\mathcal{D} = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial t} + ((a-bx)x)\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}\cdot
&lt;/math&gt;

The following infinitesimal generators belong to the 2-dimensional symmetry group of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_{\mathcal{S}_1} = -x \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}+b\dfrac{\partial}{\partial b},
\quad
\delta_{\mathcal{S}_2} = t\dfrac{\partial}{\partial t}-x\dfrac{\partial}{\partial x}-a\dfrac{\partial}{\partial a}
\cdot
&lt;/math&gt;

== Software ==

There exist many software packages in this area.&lt;ref name="Heck2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwarz1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dimas2005"/&gt; For example, the package liesymm of [[Maple (software)|Maple]] provides some Lie symmetry methods for [[partial differential equation|PDEs]].&lt;ref name="CarminatiDevittFee1992"/&gt; It manipulates integration of determining systems and also [[differential form]]s. Despite its success on small systems, its integration capabilities for solving determining systems automatically are limited by complexity issues. The DETools package uses the prolongation of [[vector field]]s for searching Lie symmetries of ODEs. Finding Lie symmetries for ODEs, in the general case, may be as complicated as solving the original system.

The '''Lucchese School''', also known as the '''School of Lucca''' and as the '''Pisan-Lucchese School''', was a school of painting and sculpture that flourished in the 11th and 12th centuries in [[Pisa]] and [[Lucca]] in [[Tuscany]] with affinities to painters in [[Volterra]].  The art is mostly anonymous.  Although not as elegant or delicate as the [[Florentine School]], Lucchese works are remarkable for their monumentality.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt;/1990&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A34902&amp;page_number=5&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1&lt;/ref&gt; videorecording by [[Sadie Benning]] that runs for 5 minutes and was filmed with [[PixelVision]] camera in black and white. The title alludes to ''[[Rubyfruit Jungle]]'', a 1973 novel by [[Rita Mae Brown]] that has explicitly [[lesbian]] themes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vdb.org/titles/me-and-rubyfruit&lt;/ref&gt;

The video bears the signature features of [[PixelVision]]: It is black and white and the image is grainy, fuzzy, and contained within a solid black frame. These hallmark characteristics are why PixelVision has been recognized for an erotic, tactile visuality &lt;ref&gt;Marks, L. "Video Haptics and Erotics." Screen 39.4 (1998): 331-48. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; which compliments the video's erotic subject matter.

Issues of female sexuality, and whether or not homoerotic desires can be reconciled with mainstream culture and normative gender roles are explored in the video. The dialogue, presented alternately through spoken words and hand-written quotations on scraps of paper, questions whether or not [[Sapphic love|sapphic]] attraction is acceptable, and depending on the answer to this, what the future holds for [[lesbian]] relationships.

The dialogue is an almost word-for-word recreation of a conversation between Molly Bolt, the protagonist of ''Rubyfruit Jungle'' with whom Benning identified,&lt;ref&gt;Spiro, Ellen. "Shooting Star: Teenage Video Maker Sadie Benning Attracts a Youthful Audience." The Advocate. 26 Mar. 1991: 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt; and her first girlfriend, Leota. The story is told in the style of a video-diary, through which Benning came out,&lt;ref&gt;Horrigan, Bill. "Sadie Benning or the Secret Annex." Art Journal 54.4 (1995): 26-29. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; though it is unclear to what extent the video constitutes an autobiography or memoir. Spoken dialogue is often paired with close-up shots of Benning's eye, while shots of written text pan from left to right, so that at each moment the viewer can read only a portion of what is written on the paper;&lt;ref&gt;Sadie Benning, “Me and Rubyfruit” (1990, 5:30) Video Works, Vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt; the movement of the camera mimics the movement of the eye when reading. The dialogue is not attributed to its speakers in the book, nor are they distinguished by medium; both girls' lines appear in written and spoken word. For this reason, the video's dialogue has also been interpreted as an internal conversation between two parts of Sadie herself, one that is more traditional and one that is more rebellious.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newmedia-art.org/cgi-bin/show-oeu.asp?ID=BEN007-3&amp;lg=GBR&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other Sadie Benning videos, such as ''[[Girl Power (video)|Girl Power]]'', the video is shot in her bedroom &lt;ref&gt;Horsfield, Kate. "Busting the Tube: A Brief History of Video Art." Feedback: The Video Data Bank Catalog of Video Art and Artist Interviews. Philadelphia: Temple UP, 2006. 14. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been said to create an intimate safe space apart from the [[Heterosexism]] of the mainstream media and the real world; though there is a tension between the protective shelter of Benning's bedroom and the exposure of her body through close ups of her eyes, hands, and ears.&lt;ref&gt;Horrigan, Bill. "Sadie Benning or the Secret Annex." Art Journal 54.4 (1995): 26-29. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream media only surfaces when the camera pans over sexualized photos of heterosexual couples, muscular men, and phone sex ads&lt;ref&gt;http://dvblog.org/?p=1062&lt;/ref&gt; and snippets of heteronormative love songs, including [[Your Cheatin' Heart]], [[Darling Nikki]], [[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]], [[Get Up Offa That Thing]], and [[Mardi Gras Mambo]].

The '''Merioola Group''' (sometimes also called the "'''Sydney Charm School'''") was a Sydney-based group of Australian artists active during the 1940s and early 1950s. The group was named after ''Merioola'', a mansion where many of the group lived.

== Merioola house ==

[[File:Merioola house - front view.png|thumb|"Merioola" house as it appeared in 1911]]

The group took its name from ''Merioola'', a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-era [[mansion]] converted into a [[boarding house]] in the Sydney suburb of [[Woollahra, New South Wales]], managed from 1941 by Chica Edgeworth Lowe. Lowe consciously encouraged artists, dancers, writers and theatre people to take up residence, forming the [[bohemian]] artistic centre of Sydney in the immediate post-war years.

Tenants included the European-born and trained artists [[Arthur Fleischmann]] (sculptor), Roland Strasser, Peter Kaiser, [[Michael Kmit]] and George de Olszanski. Others, such as [[Donald Friend]], Edgar Ritchard (artist and costume designer), [[Loudon Sainthill]] (later to become one of the most prominent theatre designers of the 20th century) and his life partner Harry Tatlock Miller (writer, critic and curator and subsequently the director of the Redfern Galleries, London), had lived and worked overseas.&lt;ref name="Diaries" /&gt; Others connected with the visual arts included photographer Alec Murray, painters Justin O'Brien, Mary Edwards, artist and later noted costume designer [[Jocelyn Rickards]]. Other tenants included dancers Alison Lee, Darya Collin, Beatrice Vitringer and Edmee Monod, author and historian [[Hector Bolitho]], architect George Beiers, civil engineer William Pierre Beiers, mathematician and astronomer John Sidgewick, musicians John and Norma [[Jon Bannenberg|Bannenberg]], and many others.&lt;ref name="French" /&gt;

When in Sydney, [[Rambert Dance Company|Ballet Rambert]] dancers often spent time at Merioola, where many theatrical and literary collaborations took place.&lt;ref name="nla" /&gt;

Although there was no common style or '[[Art movement|movement]]' at Merioola, it could be said that its artists were more interested in art as a light-hearted and poetic expression of the spirit and less interested in art as a progressive force. Many of the group had spent long years in the [[armed service]]s or had been [[displaced person]]s as a result of the [[World War II|war in Europe]].&lt;ref name="French" /&gt;

Artists under the label of the "Merioola Group" exhibited in both Sydney (November 1947) and Melbourne in 1947.&lt;ref name="French" /&gt;

[[File:Walter Gore at Merioola.jpg|thumb|Ballet Rambert dancer [[Walter Gore]] at ‘Merioola’, 1948]]

The "Sydney Charm School" was another term used synonymously to refer to the Merioola group of artists&lt;ref name="CanberraTimes-1988" /&gt; because they shared a light-hearted, decorative element in their work. The Sydney Charm School included painters [[William Dobell]], [[Russell Drysdale]], [[Donald Friend]], [[Lloyd Rees]], [[Jeffrey Smart]], [[Jean Bellette]], [[Paul Haefliger]], [[David Edgar Strachan|David Strachan]], [[Sali Herman]], [[Eric Wilson (artist)|Eric Wilson]], [[Mary Edwell-Burke]], [[Margaret Olley]], [[Roland Strasser]], [[Peter Kaiser (artist)|Peter Kaiser]], [[Harry Tatlock Miller]], [[Jocelyn Rickards]], [[Adrian Feint]], [[Arthur Fleischmann]], [[Eileen Haxton]] and applied artists [[Wallace Thornton]], [[Loudon Sainthill]] and [[Wolfgang Cardamatis]].&lt;ref name="NLAmagazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutton" /&gt;

Paul Haefliger first used the phrase "Charm School" in 1948 in a review of the work of [[Jocelyn Rickards]].&lt;ref name="NLAmagazine" /&gt; Titled ‘Artist Relies on Charm’, Haefliger's review states that Rickard's work "certainly belongs to the charm-school and, as a substitute, it will carry this young artist quite a distance".&lt;ref name="SMH-1948" /&gt;

Later, the name "The Sydney Charm School" was disparagingly used by Australian Art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] to describe the Merioola group of artists. He believed that the art made in Sydney in the period circa 1940–1955 was less worthy than the works produced in Melbourne as it was decorative and overly romantic, unlike the "truthful vital energy of Melbourne".&lt;ref name="Judd" /&gt; Regarding the difference in art expressions between Sydney and Melbourne at that time Donald Friend commented:&lt;ref name="Dutton" /&gt;

{{Quote|''Melbourne during the war and after the war went in quite heavily for social realism, which is a kind of expression of resentment against being poor and other people being poor. Sydney artists were poor. They enjoyed themselves in their attics. They were drinking plonk and eating crusts of bread... the usual thing... We didn't think of resenting it. We had a bloody marvellous time and we did all sorts of interesting things. Sydney extroverted sort of things – plenty of laughter and plenty of laughter in the paintings.''}}

By its ad hoc nature the Merioola Group were destined not to last, and by the mid-1950s its original members had left or were on the point of leaving, most overseas. But while it lasted Merioola provided a bohemian atmosphere, described by its chronicler Christine France:

{{Quote|''In post-war Sydney, Merioola was probably the most exciting place to live. Justin O'Brien said, "I've never laughed so much, not at people but with people". Merioola was always full of visitors; both local and overseas artists would call in [and] the mix of creative people at Merioola often led to interdisciplinary activities. The dancers would pose for [Arthur] Fleischmann or Alec Murray. The artists would make sets for theatrical activities. And Harry [Tatlock Miller] and [[Loudon Sainthill|Loudon [Sainthill]]] and Alec [Murray] would combine their talents as editor, designer and photographer for Ballet Rambert and Old Vic programs.''&lt;ref name="Loudon Sainthill" /&gt;}}

'''Neo-Dada Organizers''' was a Japanese [[Neo-Dada]]ist art group formed by [[Masunobu Yoshimura]]&lt;ref name=UCLA /&gt; that was active from 1960 until 1963.&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt; Composed of around ten young painters and performers who met periodically at Yoshimura's [[atelier]] in [[Shinjuku]], they "announced their radical stances through introducing destructive akushon (action) that deviates from any conventional form of art", and aimed to "shock the audience with impulsive, disturbing performances."&lt;ref name=UCLA&gt;{{cite web|title=BODY/  VIOLENCE/ CITY  The Neo-Dada Art  Actions in 1960 Tokyo|url=http://www.urbanhumanities.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/FA13-Body-Violence-City.pdf|publisher=Urban Humanities Institute, UCLA|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used the human body as their medium of art. Their violent performances were both based in artistic intentions and responded to the political climate the time.

==Origins==
Neo-Dada Organizers was reacting to a Japan that was rapidly modernizing after the destruction of [[World War II]]. Beyond opposing the art of the time, they reacted "to the increasing number and tenacity of public policies aimed at regulating the body",&lt;ref name=UCLA /&gt; and in particular to the efforts by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] government, led by Prime Minister [[Nobusuke Kishi]], to renew the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|United States Japan Security Treaty]], which led to massive protests across the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3098">The '''Neugebauer equations''' are a set of equations used to model [[color printing]] systems, developed by [[Hans E. J. Neugebauer]].&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite journal|first=H. E. J. |last=Neugebauer |title=Die theoretischen Grundlagen des Mehrfarbenbuchdrucks |trans-title=The theoretical foundations of multicolor printing |journal=Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Photographie Photophysik und Photochemie |volume=36 |issue=4 |date=1937 |page=73–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Color Technology for Electronic Imaging Devices|first=Henry R.|last=Kang|publisher=SPIE Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8194-2108-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were intended to predict the color produced by a combination of [[halftone]]s printed in [[CMYK|cyan, magenta, and yellow inks]].

The equations estimate the [[reflectance]] (in [[CIE XYZ]] coordinates or as a function of wavelength) as a function of the reflectance of the 8 possible combinations of CMY inks (or the 16 combinations of CMYK inks), weighted by the area they take up on the paper. In wavelength form:&lt;ref name=original /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R(\lambda) = \sum_{i=1}^{16} w_i R_i(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''λ'') is the reflectance of ink combination ''i'', and ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the relative proportions of the 16 colors in a uniformly colored patch. The weights are dependent on the halftone pattern and possibly subject to various forms of [[dot gain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Raja |last=Balasubramanian |title=A spectral Neugebauer model for dot-on-dot printers |journal=Proc. SPIE |volume=2413 |date=1995 |url=http://chester.xerox.com/~raja/papers/EI95.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Light can interact with the paper and ink in more complex ways. The [[Yule-Nielsen effect|Yule–Nielsen]] correction takes into account light entering through blank regions and re-emerging through ink:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=J. A. C. |last=Yule |first2=W. J. |last2=Neilsen |date=1951 |title=The Penetration of light into Paper and its Effect on Halftone Reproduction |volume=1951 |journal=TAGA Proceedings |page=65–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R(\lambda) = \left ( \sum_{i=1}^{16} w_i R_i(\lambda)^\frac{1}{n} \right )^n&lt;/math&gt;
The factor ''n'' would be 2 for a perfectly-diffusing [[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian]] paper substrate, but can be adjusted based on empirical measurements. Further considerations of the optics, such as multiple internal reflections, can be added at the price of additional complexity. 

In order to achieve a desired reflectance these equations have to be inverted to produce the actual dot areas or digital values sent to the printer, a nontrivial operation that may have multiple solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Marc F. |last=Mahy |date=1998 |title=Insight into the solutions of the Neugebauer equations |journal=Electronic Imaging: SPIE/IS&amp;T International Technical Group Newsletter |issue=Jan 1999 |page=7, 11  |url=http://www.inventoland.net/pdf/Reports/ei_newsletter99ocr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Organist and Master of the Choristers''' is a title given to a [[Director of Music]] at a [[cathedral]], particularly a [[Church of England]] cathedral. The tradition dates back to the Middle Ages. They are often both the [[organist]] and the [[choirmaster]].

As Organist and Master of the Choristers, they are primarily occupied with the training and conducting of the cathedral choir. The sub-organist or assistant organist usually plays at cathedral services, although they will also be expected to take over the choral duties if the organist is unavailable.

One of the longest serving Organist and Master of the Choristers was Andrew Goodwin, who retired from [[Bangor Cathedral]] on 31 October 2009. He had served there for 37 years. He was the master of the choristers when [[Aled Jones]] was in the choir.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Other long-serving holders of the title include Charles J Brennan who spent 60 years (1904-1964) at [[St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast|Belfast Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newulsterbiography.co.uk/index.php/home/viewPerson/1820&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parametric Thinking''' is the influence of engaging in a [[thinking process]] that links, relates and outputs calculated actions to generate solutions to problems, rather than simply seeking them.&lt;ref&gt;http://fmj.ifma.org/article/Case+Study%3A+An+Integrated+Approach+to+Workplace+Design+and+Delivery/2371947/287706/article.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has its origins in the design fields of; [[urban design]], [[architectural design]], [[interior design]], [[Industrial design|industrial]] and [[furniture design]].  The process is associated with [[Parametricism]] a style within contemporary avant-garde architecture, promoted as a successor to post-modern architecture and modern architecture.

==History==
Parametric thinking emerged as a theory-driven design education, project and delivery movement in the early 2010s, with its earliest practitioners harnessing and adapting the then new [[parametric design]] software and other advanced computational processes that had been introduced within architecture and related design fields.  In the architecture education context in 2011 professors of the schools of architecture David Karle and Brian Kelly of [[University of Nebraska]] published advocacy for a paradigm shift in design education.  

Karle and Kelly also highligthed that "digital tools are currently being used in design schools across the country.  This paradigm in both education and practice of architecture is continually changing the profession, from the way in which design is conceived, represented, documented, and fabricated.  [[Parametric design]] can be defined as series of questions to establish the variables of a design and a computational definition that can be utilized to facilitate a variety of solutions.  Parametric thinking is a way of relating tangible and intangible systems into a design proposal removed from digital tool specificity and establishes relationships between properties within a system.  It asks architects to start with the design parameters and not preconceived or predetermined design solutions.".&lt;ref&gt;http://cumincad.architexturez.net/doc/oai-cumincadworks.id-acadiaregional2011_012{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parametric thinking in the design process context of best practice as defined by designer/technologist Chris Swartout of [http://mmoser.com M Moser Associates] is "a [[pedagogic]] approach that combines design and generative solution delivery through reliance on a multidisciplinary team’s knowledge expertise at the outset of the project. This leads to increased productivity, achieving the desired outcome that balances all the interests of design, schedule, cost, aesthetics and functionality, while not predetermining a solution. This approach enhances design output and reduces abortive work."  &lt;ref&gt;http://fmj.ifma.org/article/Case+Study%3A+An+Integrated+Approach+to+Workplace+Design+and+Delivery/2371947/287706/article.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Farshid Moussavi]] professor in practice at [[Harvard University Graduate School of Design]] has argued that parametric thinking at some level has always existed in architecture as a discipline because "great architecture has been aware of its societal role, and has consequently been informed by [[multivalent]] parameters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elcontexto.net/post/15032978670/farshid-moussavi-on-the-need-for-parametric&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.architectural-review.com/viewpoints-farshid-moussavi-on-the-need-for-parametric-thinking/8620000.article/

[[Image:Pauline Rita.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Pauline Rita as a young woman]]
'''Pauline Rita''' (c.1842 – 28 June 1920) was an English [[soprano]] and actress.  During her early career, she was best known for her performances in [[operetta]]s and [[comic opera]]s at the Opera Comique and was associated with impresario [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]].  Later, she married flautist John Radcliff, and the two performed together for many years.

==Biography==

===Oratorio and operetta===
In 1872, Rita took part in a joint recital with [[Charles Santley]] at [[St James's Hall]], London.&lt;ref&gt;''Daily News'', 22 May 1872, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year she sang in [[Handel]]'s oratorio ''[[Athalia (Handel)|Athalia]]'' in [[Glasgow]], where the local critic was unimpressed: "Mdlle. Rita has a voice nearly always in tune, but of a shrill and unsympathetic quality, and she indulges from time to time in that fatal ''vibrato'' to which we have so often objected."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Glasgow Herald]]'', 23 October 1872, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, she performed in [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]'s light opera company at the [[Opera Comique]], in ''The Broken Branch'', an English version of [[Gaston Serpette]]'s ''La branch cassée'', in which she received better notices: "Madame Pauline Rita has achieved a triumph in her first appearance on the stage. She possesses a voice of singular flexibility, acts well, and looks attractive."&lt;ref&gt;''The Graphic'', 29 August 1874, p. 211; also ''The [[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', 29 August 1874, p. 11: "Mdme Pauline Rita has in her part a very pretty 'vocal waltz', which she executes with all possible neatness and fluency."&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1874 she played the lead role of the Prince de Conti in [[Charles Lecocq]]'s ''Les Prés St. Gervais'' at the [[Criterion Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Graphic'', 5 December 1874, p. 546&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, she starred in the title role, Clairette Angot, in a revival of Lecocq's ''[[La fille de Madame Angot]]'' at the Opera Comique, which replaced ''[[La Périchole]]'' on the bill with ''[[Trial by Jury]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fitz-Gerald, S. J. Adair. [https://archive.org/details/storyofthesavoyo009133mbp ''The Story of the Savoy Opera''], p. 12, D. Appleton and Company (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; In October of that year she appeared as Barbara in [[Alfred Cellier]]'s ''The Tower of London'' at the Prince's Theatre, [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Manchester Weekly Times]]'', 9 October 1875, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1876 at the [[Royalty Theatre]], she appeared under Carte's management as Gustave Muller in ''The Duke's Daughter''.&lt;ref name="Whos"&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/R/RitaPauline.htm Pauline Rita] at ''Who was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company'', 27 August 2001, accessed 7 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 May 1876, Rita was the beneficiary of a special matinée at the [[Princess's Theatre]] at which [[Selina Dolaro]], Mrs. Howard Paul, [[Arthur Cecil]] and many others contributed, and [[Alfred Cellier]] conducted his operetta ''[[Dora's Dream]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 7 May 1876, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; That summer, she repeated her roles of Gustave Miller and also played the Plaintiff in ''Trial by Jury'' on tour with Carte's Opera Bouffe Company (with Carte himself as musical director).&lt;ref name=Whos/&gt; In 1877, at a benefit performance for [[Henry Compton (actor)|Henry Compton]], described by ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' as "undeniably the greatest event known in the annals of the Stage", Rita played the Plaintiff in a star-studded performance of ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', conducted by [[Arthur Sullivan]], with [[W. S. Gilbert]] as the Associate, [[Arthur Cecil]] as the Usher, [[W. H. Cummings]] as the Defendant, and famous performers such as [[George Grossmith]], [[W. S. Penley]], [[Kate Bishop (actress)|Kate Bishop]] and [[Marion Terry]] in the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 4 March 1877, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the Plaintiff, Rita played two [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] roles – one for D'Oyly Carte and one not. She played Aline in ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' on tour in [[Liverpool]] in March 1878, and in September 1879 she played Josephine in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' in the production mounted by Carte's former partners in the Comedy Opera Company after he had separated from them.  She never returned to D'Oyly Carte management.&lt;ref name=Whos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 29 and 6; ''The Era'', 7 September 1879, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1870s, Rita performed with [[Charles Morton (impresario)|Charles Morton]]'s opera company at the Opera Comique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Henry Chance Newton| title = Sixty years' stage service: being a record of the life of Charles Morton, "The father of the halls."| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TT1AAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA122| year = 1905| publisher = Gale and Polden, Ltd.| page = 122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In 1881, Rita's voice suffered from overwork, and she moved to Australia to rest and stay with family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Leonardo De Lorenzo| title = My Complete Story of the Flute: The Instrument, the Performer, the Music| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qdxENVZtDccC&amp;pg=PA153| year = 1992| publisher = Texas Tech University Press| isbn = 978-0-89672-277-4| page = 153 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1884, she married the celebrated [[flautist]], John Radcliff (1842–1917), to whom she had become engaged in London in 1881.  Together, they organised a successful three-year tour through Australia and New Zealand in 1884–86.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;''[[The Times]]'' Obituary, 26 July 1920, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 17 January 1885, p. 17, and 8 May 1886, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Britain, they continued to give the programme they had perfected on tour: "''Flutes of All Ages'': Mr Radcliff ... playing on twenty different instruments selections from the music of all countries and all times. The entertainment was varied by songs, rendered with finished vocal ability, by Madame Pauline Rita."&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 25 December 1886, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; They then developed this show as ''Pan to Pinafore'' and presented it around Britain for several years with great success.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 7 July 1888, p. 7; ''The Bristol Mercury and Daily Post'', 8 January 1890; ''Jackson's Oxford Journal'', 20 February 20, 1892&lt;/ref&gt;

Rita undertook some vocal teaching, her success being noted in the press.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Penny Illustrated Paper and Illustrated Times]]'', 8 September 1894, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;  In later years, she became blind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Musical Times| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GY4PAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA160| year = 1917| publisher = Novello| page = 160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She died at her home in [[Kensington]], London, after a long illness.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

The '''Pearl District''' is an area of [[Portland, Oregon]], formerly occupied by [[warehouse]]s, light [[industry]] and [[railroad]] [[classification yard]]s and now noted for its [[art gallery|art galleries]], upscale businesses and residences.  The area has been undergoing significant [[urban renewal]] since the mid-1980s when it was reclassified as [[mixed use]] from industrial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marshall-wells.com/historypearl3.html|title=Marshall-Wells Lofts &lt;&gt; History|author=|date=|website=www.marshall-wells.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225132726/http://www.marshall-wells.com/historypearl3.html|archivedate=25 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the arrival of artists, the removal of a [[viaduct]] and construction of the [[Portland Streetcar]]. It now mostly consists of high-rise [[condominium]]s and [[loft apartment|warehouse-to-loft conversions]].

The increase of high-rise condominiums and warehouse-to-loft conversions was made evident with the construction of the [[Cosmopolitan on the Park]] building, which opened in Summer 2016. The Cosmopolitan on the Park residential building is now the tallest building in the Pearl District and the 8th tallest building in Portland, contributing to the changing Portland skyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nextportland.com/2014/12/09/cosmopolitan-on-the-park/|title=North Pearl High-Rises, Part I: The Cosmopolitan on the Park (images)|last=Nextportland|date=2014-12-09|website=Next Portland|access-date=2017-01-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202091637/http://www.nextportland.com/2014/12/09/cosmopolitan-on-the-park/|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The area was formerly used for [[warehouse|warehousing]], light [[Industry|industrial]] purposes and a [[railroad]] yard and was known as the "Northwest Industrial Triangle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=29660 |title=More polish for the Pearl |author=Don Hamilton |work=[[Portland Tribune]] |date=April 29, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221234201/http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=29660|archivedate=February 21, 2008|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, the Lovejoy Viaduct, an elevated portion of NW Lovejoy Street from the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland, Oregon)|Broadway Bridge]] past NW 10th Avenue was demolished, opening dozens of surrounding blocks (including some [[brownfield]] sites) for development, which peaked in the 2000s.  The viaduct was notable for the [[Lovejoy Columns]], painted by a railroad watchman who worked below; two of them have been saved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chatterbox.typepad.com/portlandarchitecture/2005/10/more_on_the_lov.html|title=More on the Lovejoy Columns|author=|date=|website=Portland Architecture|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604111614/http://chatterbox.typepad.com/portlandarchitecture/2005/10/more_on_the_lov.html|archivedate=4 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing density has attracted a mix of restaurants, [[brewpub]]s, shops, and art galleries.

The origins of how the Pearl District got its name is still up for debate. According to the Pearl District Business Association, Thomas Augustine, a local gallery owner, coined the name Pearl District around the turn of the millennium to suggest that some of its urban decay industrial buildings were like crusty oysters, and that the galleries and artists' lofts within were like pearls. However, in 2002, Thomas Augustine amended his story, suggesting that the idea for the Pearl District came from his friend Pearl Marie Amhara who would throw parties for creatives in warehouses in what is now considered the Pearl District. Attendees started calling the area “Pearl’s place” and “Pearl’s District”. Local business people were looking to label the growing area and the name finally caught on when a writer for [[Alaska Airlines]] borrowed and popularized Augustine's phrase. The "warehouse district" or the "brewery district" were two other suggestions that are still used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2002/04/pearl_districts_namesake_was_a.html | work=[[The Oregonian]] | author=Margie Boule | date=April 14, 2002 | title=Pearl District's namesake was a jewel of a woman | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410221052/http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2002/04/pearl_districts_namesake_was_a.html | archivedate=April 10, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pearldistrict.org/pearl-district-name/|title=How Did the Pearl District Get Its Name?|date=2014-01-06|newspaper=Pearl District Neighborhood Association|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912063619/http://www.pearldistrict.org/pearl-district-name/|archivedate=2015-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre Marteau''' (French for ''Peter [[Hammer]]'') was the [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of a supposed [[publishing house]]. Allegedly located in [[Cologne]] from the 17th century onward, contemporaries were well-aware that such a publishing house never actually existed. Instead, the imprint was a fiction under which publishers and printers — in the Netherlands, France and Germany — evaded the open identification with books they published.

==History==
===Open pseudonym and political joke, spreading in the 1660s===
[[Image:Recveil-Marteau-1660.gif|thumb|180px|right|Probably the first Marteau-title: ''L'Histoire de Henry III'' (1660).]]
The first [[French language|French-language]] Marteau books appeared in the 1660s and were immediately identified as not actually being published by a man named Pierre Marteau residing in Cologne. The name would have been that of a Frenchman who had opened his shop outside France yet close to the French border. Cologne's geographical location smelled of political freedom — Marteau would avoid France's censorship by publishing outside France; Cologne promised access to the European market and the chance to get a good deal of the production smuggled back into France where it would sell on the black market for ten times the price.

French publishers, political dissidents and [[Huguenot]]s who had suffered political persecution under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] had opened their shops in [[Amsterdam]] and they would soon open new shops at [[The Hague]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Geneva]]. The [[Dutch Republic]] (a.k.a. the ''United Provinces'') and [[Switzerland]] protected Europe's [[Protestantism|Protestants]] of the [[reformed churches]], the minority among the three European confessions. These were the privileged countries French refugees tended to go.

[[Germany#The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation (843–1806)|Germany]], a political entity of hundreds of little territories, half of them "Orthodox" [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Protestant]] half of them Catholic, which all together hardly ever united under the rule of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]], was only a third option. Some of the more liberal places like [[Hamburg]] ([[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] harboured sectarians and clandestine bookshops) and the university cities [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], [[Leipzig]] and [[Jena]] offered freedoms to critical intellectuals, yet only a few states like [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] openly sympathised with the reformed branch of Protestantism to which France's Huguenots belonged. Germany was a choice with disadvantages. Cologne, however, was of all the options Germany granted the worst, which was to become apparent at the beginning of the 18th century when most of Germany's territories joined the Dutch Republic and [[Great Britain]] against France in the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Great Alliance]] of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. The two [[Wittelsbach]]-ruled countries — Cologne and [[Bavaria]] — were the only important western European territories that supported Louis XIV.

The first Marteau books were French and most certainly printed in Amsterdam by publishers who would not risk to tell their names even in the Netherlands. Research has hinted at Amsterdam publisher [[Elzevier]] as the man who invented the imprint. It was, at first, just one among many openly misleading imprints. Unlike the usual obvious pseudonyms like "Jacques le Sincere", the name "Pierre Marteau" sounded real. The detail which gave away his virtuality remained on the reader's side — he would identify Cologne as the likely and yet unlikely place to go. "Hammer" made the joke a little bit more explicit: this man had courage and he was as real and as bold as a hammer.

Unlike other pseudonyms which appeared on only one title page, Marteau was to have a career that could be made only by a good joke and a complete lack of [[intellectual property rights]]. Numerous publishers began to sell books under the label. Remarkably, the uncoordinated joint venture was nonetheless able to produce a distinct publisher's identity. Only certain books attracted the imprint: French yet anti-French political satire, pirated editions, sexually explicit titles.

===German Marteau books and the European decades between 1689 and 1721===
[[Image:Historical profile of German Marteau-production.gif|thumb|left|Historical Profile of the German Marteau production, books per year]]
A second branch of Marteau books developed in the late 1680s when [[German language|German-language]] titles first assumed the curious imprint. 1689 became a landmark year, the year of the [[Glorious Revolution]] which had brought a Dutch regent onto the English throne. [[William III of England|William of Orange]], who had led the Dutch resistance against France in the 1670s, became William III of England, Scotland and Wales. Whilst France protected the deposed [[James II of England|Stuart Pretender]], William was particularly keen to move both the Netherlands and his newly acquired Britain into an anti-French alliance on Germany's behalf — Louis XIV had just attacked the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]; the [[Nine Years' War]] began —, the first phase of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Great Alliance]], a period German intellectuals would soon praise as the beginning of a thoroughly European age. German intellectuals had always admired France's intellectuals and the latest Parisian fashions, yet they had also felt uneasy about their love of France. Germany's critical voices complained, as they considered their own leanings towards France, that Germany had not produced any authentic German culture.

In the 1680s things changed. All of a sudden, one could be a German patriot and openly embrace French culture — if only one stressed the fact that France's intellectuals were by now mostly critical of their own country's political repression and ambition. French dissidents published political journals, newspapers and books outside France on the international market. Germans bought and imitated them after the events of 1689 without the slightest feeling of national disloyalty. The new French authors propagated the very Europe which had come to Germany's assistance. The Great Alliance against France was produced and supported by the French press of the Netherlands. Marteau was the publisher of the Great Alliance and the new modern Europe fighting France, the hegemonic power striving for a "universal monarchy" over all its neighbours. The Marteau label became fashionable, and German publishers adopted it: it flourished, with translations of French Marteau books and with original German titles now appearing under the labels of Marteau, his Widow, his Son, and a growing line of virtual family members continuing the business.

The peaks of the German Marteau production coincide with the political events Marteau covered. The beginning of the Great Alliance in 1689, its renewal on the eve of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] in 1701, its end in a [[Tory]] victory in London 1709/10 and the succeeding [[Treaty of Utrecht|peace negotiations at Utrecht]], kept Marteau's political authors busy.

Europe turned out to be unreliable. English Tory politicians crafted the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which favored France's aspirations even though France had nearly lost the recent war. German intellectuals were unhappy with Europe, yet they still had to trust in Europe and to promote the European idea if [[Hanover]]'s King [[George I of Great Britain|George]] was to continue his aspirations to the English throne. He crossed the [[English Channel|Channel]] in 1714 and had to survive a phase of political turmoil in 1715 and 1716 — covered by Marteau with all the old anti-French political bias: France promoted the Stuart Pretender in his fight against the newly established German King. The Great Alliance gave way to the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance]] of 1718-1720 in which Austria, France, Great Britain, and the United Provinces joined their forces to resolve the next European conflict. The fate of Europe remained on the political agenda until 1721, with the other half of Europe fighting the [[Great Northern War]]. The conflict about [[Sweden]]'s and [[Russia]]'s future power had begun in 1700 and involved northern and eastern Europe from [[Stockholm]] to [[Constantinople]]. It ended in 1721 and brought the European period of 1689-1721 to a silent end.

[[Image:La France Galante 1696.gif|thumb|Entertainment and politics: ''La France Galante'' (1696).]] 
Political books dominated Marteau's production. The peculiar ''Memoires pour rendre la paix perpetuelle en Europe'' appeared at one of Marteau's rivals in Cologne: Jacques le Pacifique published their first volume in 1712 ([[Immanuel Kant]] would refer to the outline of a union of European states at the end of the century in his famous treatise on a permanent world peace). Politics could hardly be separated from entertainment. [[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer]] published her political gossip under the ubiquitous label. The secrets of the diplomats negotiating at Utrecht were a bestseller. Political novels like ''La Guerre d'Espagne'' (Cologne: Pierre Marteau, 1707) were extremely influential — the book mixed fact and fiction, sections of newspaper history with personal adventures of its hero, a virtual [[James Bond]] in the services of Louis XIV.

Satirical novels written by students in Halle, Leipzig and Jena claimed to be printed in Cologne. A pirated edition of the first German translation of ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' appeared under the imprint. The mixing of fact and fiction, information and entertainment, intellectual theft and scandal — the only possible answer to the censorship laws flourishing all over Europe — marked the Marteau production between 1660 and 1721.

===European publisher and German national icon===
A third phase of the Marteau production began after the European decades of 1689-1721 with the nationalistic turn of the 1720s and 1730s. Marteau's German production became pro-German and potentially anti-French, finding its peaks in the years of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

The 20th and 21st centuries saw only very few new Marteau publications, with the [[left-wing politics|leftist]] Peter Hammer Verlag in [[Wuppertal]]. The old publishing house's modern web-presence at pierre-marteau.com remains a virtual enterprise led by historians of the 18th century who use the label as a well established brand name to publish texts of the period 1650-1750 and research dealing with that period. {{third-party inline|date=March 2016}}

[[File:John Michael Wright - Lord Mungo Murray (Am Morair Mungo Moireach), 1668 - 1700. Son of 1st Marquess of Atholl - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Clan Murray|Lord Mungo Murray]], by [[John Michael Wright]], an early example of the full-length portrait in [[Highland dress]] (c. 1680)]]

'''Portrait painting in Scotland''' includes all forms of [[Portrait painting|painted portraiture]] in Scotland, from its beginnings in the early sixteenth century until the present day. The origins of the tradition of portrait painting in Scotland are in the [[Renaissance in Scotland|Renaissance]], particularly through contacts with the Netherlands. The first portrait of a named person that survives is that of Archbishop [[William Elphinstone]], probably painted by a Scottish artist using Flemish techniques around 1505. Around the same period Scottish monarchs turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits, painted in oils on wood. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the [[Scotland in the early modern period|minorities and regencies]] it underwent for much of the sixteenth century. It began to flourish after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], with paintings of royal figures and nobles by Netherlands artists [[Hans Eworth]], [[Arnold Bronckorst]] and [[Adrian Vanson]]. A specific type of Scottish picture from this era was the "vendetta portrait", designed to keep alive the memory of an atrocity. The [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London. The result has been seen as a shift "from crown to castle", as the nobility and local [[laird]]s became the major sources of patronage.

The first significant Scottish portrait artist was [[George Jameson]], who became one of the most successful painters of the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. He trained the [[Baroque]] artist [[John Michael Wright]]. In this period the full-length portrait in [[Highland dress]] became a common form of painting. [[William Aikman (painter)|William Aikman]] emerged as the leading Scottish portrait-painter of the next generation. He, like most Scottish painters of note before the late eighteenth century, migrated to London. [[John Alexander (painter)|John Alexander]] and William Mossman painted many of the figures of early-[[Scottish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Edinburgh. [[Allan Ramsay (painter)|Allan Ramsay]] established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility and he undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment. He later focused on royal portraits, anticipating the [[grand manner]] of [[Joshua Reynolds]], but many of his early portraits, particularly of women, are less formal and more intimate. The leading portrait painter of the second half of the century was [[Henry Raeburn]], the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland, his subjects went beyond the nobility to the middle classes. His pupils included the brothers [[Alexander Robertson (artist)|William (Alexander)]], [[Archibald Robertson (painter)|Archibald]] and [[Andrew Robertson (miniaturist)|Andrew Robertson]]. The former two brothers founded the [[Columbian Academy of Painting]] in New York, and Andrew was the leading Scottish [[Portrait miniature|miniaturist]] of his day.

The generation of painters that followed Raeburn included David Watson, [[John Watson Gordon]] and [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] who became one of the most influential British artists of the century. From the mid-nineteenth century, portrait painting, particularity the miniature, declined as an art, photography also began to influence painting. Major figures who worked in portraiture and came to prominence in the second half of the century included [[Francis Grant (artist)|Francis Grant]], [[Robert Scott Lauder]], [[William Quiller Orchardson]] and [[John Pettie]]. In the twentieth century the move away from [[figurative art|figurative painting]] to [[impressionism]] and [[abstract art|abstraction]], speeded the decline of portrait painting. Artists who continued to pursue portraiture included [[Francis Cadell (artist)|Francis Cadell]], [[Cecile Walton]], [[Dorothy Johnstone]] and [[James Cowie (artist)|James Cowie]]. The second half of the twentieth century saw a general movement back towards figurative representation. [[Alexander Moffat]] was among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s. The artists associated with Moffat known as the "new Glasgow Boys" included [[Steven Campbell (artist)|Steven Campbell]], [[Peter Howson]], [[Ken Currie]] and [[Adrian Wisniewski]]. A parallel movement in Edinburgh, focused around the 369 Gallery in the city, included [[Caroline McNairn]], [[Robert MacLaurin]] and [[Gwen Hardie]].

and perhaps Peeken Bovelant, an apprentice of an Antwerp painter [[Goswin van der Weyden|Goswijn van der Weyden]], was brought to Scotland by [[Andrew Halyburton]], the trading agent in [[Middelburg]], in September 1505. No details are known of his work, except his assistance in painting costumes and heraldry for tournaments, but the king gave him a salary and accommodation, and it is likely that Piers made portraits for the court. Piers returned to Flanders from [[Inverkeithing]] in July 1508. Some references in the royal accounts call him a "Frenchman".&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1901), p. xci, 173: M. Apted &amp; S. Hannabuss, ''Painters in Scotland'' (Edinburgh, SRS &amp; Edina Press, 1978), pp. 70–72: J. E. A. Dawson, ''Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587'' (Edinburgh, 2007), p. 59: D.

The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the [[Scotland in the early modern period|minorities and regencies]] it underwent for much of the sixteenth century. In his majority [[James V of Scotland|James V]] was probably more concerned with architectural expressions of royal identity.&lt;ref name=Tittler2008p455-6/&gt; [[Mary Queen of Scots]] had been brought up in the French court, where she was drawn and painted by major European artists, but she did not commission any adult portraits, with the exception of the joint portrait with her second husband [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]]. This may have reflected an historic Scottish pattern, where [[heraldry|heraldic display]], or an elaborate tomb were considered more important than a portrait.&lt;ref name=Dawson2007pp55-6/&gt;

Portraiture began to flourish after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] in the mid-sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=Tittler2008p455-6&gt;R. Tittler, "Portrait, politics and society", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, ''A Companion to Tudor Britain'' (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008), {{ISBN|1-4051-3740-1}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;455–6.&lt;/ref&gt; There were anonymously painted portraits of important individuals, including one of [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]] (1556).&lt;ref name="Tittler2008p455-6"/&gt; Artists from the Low Countries remained important. [[Hans Eworth]], who had been court painter to [[Mary I of England]], painted a number of Scottish subjects in the 1560s. His 1561 wedding portraits were miniatures commemorating the brief marriage of the earl of Bothwell and [[Jean Gordon, Countess of Bothwell|Jean Gordon]].&lt;ref name=Dawson2007pp55-6/&gt; He also painted [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray]] in 1561 and two years later he painted a joint portrait of the young Darnley and his brother [[Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox|Charles Stuart]].&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain: 1530 to 1790'' (Yale University Press, 5th edn., 1994), {{ISBN|0-300-05833-0}}, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Seton, 7th Lord Seton|Lord Seton]], [[Master of the Royal Household]], commissioned two portraits in the Netherlands in the 1570s, one of himself and one a family portrait.&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/&gt; A specific type of Scottish picture from this era was the "vendetta portrait", designed to keep alive the memory of an atrocity. Examples include the ''Darnley memorial portrait'', which shows the young [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]] kneeling at his murdered father's tomb, and the life-size portrait of the corpse of ''The Bonnie Earl of Moray'', vividly showing the wounds received by [[James Stewart, 2nd Earl of Moray]] when he was killed by [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly]] in 1591.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain'', pp. 48–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was an attempt to produce a series of portraits of Scottish kings in panel portraits, probably for the [[royal entry]] of the fifteen-year-old James VI in 1579, which are Medieval in form. In James VI's personal reign, Renaissance forms of portraiture began to dominate.&lt;ref name=Tittler2008p455-6/&gt; He employed two Flemish artists, [[Arnold Bronckorst]] in the early 1580s and [[Adrian Vanson]] from around 1584 to 1602, who have left a visual record of the king and major figures at the court.&lt;ref name=Dawson2007pp55-6/&gt; However, the [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603 removed a major source of artistic patronage in Scotland as James VI and his court moved to London. The result has been seen as a shift "from crown to castle", as the nobility and local [[laird]]s became the major sources of patronage.&lt;ref name="Wormald1991p193"&gt;J.

By the seventeenth century the fashion for portraiture had spread down the social order to lairds such as [[Sir Colin Campbell, 2nd Baronet|Colin Campbell of Glenorchy]] and [[John Napier|John Napier of Merchiston]].&lt;ref name=Dawson2007pp55-6/&gt; [[Adam de Colone]], perhaps the son of Adrian Vanson and probably trained in the Netherlands, was working in England in the 1620s. In 1623 he painted his portrait of ''George Seaton, 3rd Earl of Winton and his sons'' and another of Seaton's wife ''Anne Hay with her two daughters''.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'' (Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|1-85158-251-7}}, pp. 57–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first significant native artist was [[George Jamesone]] of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who, having trained in the Netherlands, became one of the most successful portrait painters of the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. He trained the [[Baroque]] artist [[John Michael Wright]] (1617–94), who also studied in Rome with [[Poussin]] and [[Velázquez]]. Wright painted both Scottish and English subjects,&lt;ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9&gt;A. Thomas, ''The Renaissance'', in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, ''The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0-19-162433-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;198–9.&lt;/ref&gt; including his sensitive portrait of the architect [[William Bruce (architect)|William Bruce]] (1664) and styled himself as "king's painter". His full-length painting of [[Clan Murray|Lord Mungo Murray]] in [[Highland dress]] (c. 1680) is an early example of what became a standard format of Scottish portrait. The [[Scotland under the Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] period saw the emergence of [[David Scougall]] (c.1610-1680), mainly noted for his portrait of the [[Covenanter]] leader [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll|Archibald Campbell]]. Also important was the miniaturist [[David Paton (artist)|David Paton]] (fl. 1668–1708),&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p46&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0-500-20333-4}}, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; who worked mainly in [[Plumbago drawing|plumbago]], but also painted portraits in [[oil paint|oil]]. Visiting artists included [[Jacob Willemszoon de Wet|Jacob de Wett]] (c. 1610–c. 1691), who was commissioned in 1684 to paint images of 110 kings for Holyroodhouse and similar work at Glamis Castle.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain'', p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Alexander was born in Aberdeen and was a great grandson of portrait painter [[George Jamesone]]. He studied in London and Rome, returning to Scotland about 1720.&lt;ref name=Waterhouse1994p300&gt;Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain'', p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; His younger contemporary William Mossman (1700–71) was also from Aberdeen and studied in Rome. Both worked predominately in the north-east around their home city, but also painted many of the figures of early-Enlightenment Edinburgh. Alexander's best known work included the portrait of [[George Drummond]] the [[List of Lord Provosts of Edinburgh|Lord Provost of Edinburgh]] (1756), who had been responsible for the creation of the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] in Edinburgh and the [[Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh|Royal Infirmary]], which is shown in the background of the painting. Mosman's work included his portrait of ''John Campbell of the Bank'' (1749), who was chief cashier of the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] and a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]], but who is depicted in the recently forbidden Highland dress. Because of his Jacobite sympathies Alexander was forced to leave for the continent after the rebellion of 1745, and in Rome he made a living painting the Jacobite expatriates who congregated there, before his return a few years later.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p56&gt;MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] (1713–84) studied in Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility. He undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], including his friend the philosopher [[David Hume]] and the visiting [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was [[Principal Painter in Ordinary]] to [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors, but also more intimate works like that of ''Queen Charlotte and her Children'' (c. 1755). His work has been seen as anticipating the [[Grand Manner]] of [[Joshua Reynolds]], but many of his early portraits, particularly of women, are less formal and more intimate studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/490799/Allan-Ramsay "Allan Ramsey"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading portrait painter of the second half of the century was [[Henry Raeburn]] (1756–1823). He was the first significant artist to pursue his entire career in Scotland. Born in Edinburgh and returning there after a trip to Italy in 1786, he is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, going beyond the aristocracy to lawyers, doctors, professors, writers and ministers,&lt;ref name=Campbell2003pp142-3/&gt; adding elements of Romanticism to the Grand Manner tradition.&lt;ref&gt;C.

William and Archibald went on to found the Columbian Academy of Painting in New York, and Andrew to be the leading Scottish [[Portrait miniature|miniaturist]] of his day. Also associated with Raeburn towards the end of his career were [[John Syme]] (1795–1861) and [[Colvin Smith]] (1795–1875).&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, ''Scottish Art'', pp. 151 and 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-nineteenth century portrait painting declined as an art. This was partly due to the advent of photography, which could record the human face with greater ease.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"&gt;P. Allara, ''Pictures of People: Alice Neels American Portrait Gallery'' (UPNE, 2000), {{ISBN|1-58465-036-2}}, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; While grander commissions were still made, the miniature in particular, which had often been in an intimate locket or brooch, was largely replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Arts Council of Great Britain. Scottish Committee, ''British Portrait Miniatures: An Exhibition Arranged for the Period of the Edinburgh International Festival, 1965'' (London: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1968), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Octavius Hill]] (1802–70) originally took an interest in photography as a means of being able to record the figures of [[Great Disruption]] of 1843 for a composite painted portrait, but as part of [[Hill &amp; Adamson]] he was one of the founding fathers of [[art photography]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Gernsheim, ''Creative Photography: Aesthetic Trends, 1839–1960'' (Courier Dover, 1962), {{ISBN|0-486-26750-4}}, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as portrait photography inherited many of the conventions of painting, photography also began to influence painting. From the 1840s John Watson Gordon's work began to be influenced by early photography, with cool light and muted colours, as can be seen in his full-length portrait of ''Principal Lee'' (1847).&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990p163-4/&gt; Major figures who worked in portraiture and came to prominence in the second half of the century included [[Francis Grant (artist)|Francis Grant]], who became the first Scottish president of the Royal Academy in London, [[Robert Scott Lauder]] (1803–69), [[William Quiller Orchardson]] (1832–1910) and [[John Pettie]] (1839–93).&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990p163-4/&gt; [[John Zephaniah Bell]] (1794–1883) was educated in London and was a forerunner of the trend of Parisian education that would become common among Scottish artists from the later nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp75-6/&gt; The most significant grouping in late nineteenth-century Scotland, the [[Glasgow Boys]], mainly focused on landscape. They were influenced by the leading continental artists of the day and broke with Victorian convention.

[[File:Pyrography The White Horse.jpg|thumb|300px|The White Horse, pyrography on [[Populus|poplar]].]]
'''Pyrography''' or '''pyrogravure''' is the art of decorating wood or other materials with burn marks resulting from the controlled application of a heated object such as a [[Fireplace poker|poker]]. It is also known as '''pokerwork''' or '''wood burning'''.

The term means "writing with fire", from the Greek ''pur'' (fire) and ''graphos'' (writing).&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Podgorski; ''Before You Pick Up That Nib: Wood Burning 101'', p7 {{ISBN|978-0-557-05114-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be practiced using specialized modern pyrography tools, or using a metal implement heated in a fire, or even sunlight concentrated with a magnifying [[lens (optics)|lens]].  "Pyrography dates from the 17th century and reached its highest standard in the 19th century. In its crude form it is pokerwork." &lt;ref&gt;"Pyrography." Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. London: Chambers Harrap, 2012. Credo Reference. Web. 2 Mar 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large range of tones and shades can be achieved. Varying the type of tip used, the temperature, or the way the iron is applied to the material all create different effects. After the design is burned in, wooden objects are often coloured. Light-coloured [[hardwoods]] such as [[sycamore]], [[basswood]], [[beech]] and [[birch]] are most commonly used, as their fine [[grain]] is not obtrusive. However, other woods, such as maple, [[pine]] or [[oak]], are also used. Pyrography is also applied to leather items, using the same hot-iron technique. [[Leather]] lends itself to bold designs, and also allows very subtle shading to be achieved. Specialist vegetable-tanned leather must be used for pyrography (as modern [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] methods leave chemicals in the leather which are [[toxic]] when burned), typically in light colours for good contrast.

Pyrography is also popular among [[gourd]] crafters and artists, where designs are burned onto the exterior of a dried hard-shell gourd.

== History ==
[[File:The Tawny Eagle.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Tawny Eagle. Davide Della Noce pyrography.]]
The process has been practiced by a number of cultures including the [[Egypt]]ians and some [[Africa]]n tribes since the dawn of recorded history. Pyrographer Robert Boyer hypothesises that the art form dates back to prehistory, when early humans created designs using the charred remains of their fires.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, R; ''The Amazing Art of Pyrography'', Evanston 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-879260-12-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was known in China from the time of the [[Han dynasty]], where it was known as "Fire Needle Embroidery".&lt;ref&gt;[http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/16Traditions1930.html China Culture - pyrography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906032848/http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/16Traditions1930.html |date=6 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Victorian era]], the invention of pyrography machines sparked a widespread interest in the craft, and it was at this time that the term "pyrography" was coined (previously the name "pokerwork" had been most widely used)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkaboutcrafts.com/crafttopics/crafts/pyrography.htm Walkabout Crafts - pyrography]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, a [[Melbourne]] [[architect]] by the name of [[Alfred Smart]] discovered that water-based [[paint]] could be applied hot to wood by pumping [[benzoline]] fumes through a heated hollow [[platinum]] [[pencil]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Julie; ''With Mellow Shades and Character Made: The Richness of Australian Pokerwork'' in ''Carter's Antiques and Collectables Magazine'', Sept 2000&lt;/ref&gt; This improved the pokerwork process by allowing the addition of tinting and [[shading]] that were previously impossible. In the early 20th century, the development of the electric pyrographic hot wire wood etching machine further automated the pokerwork process, and [[Art Nouveau]] pyrographic gloveboxes and other works were popular in that era. Pyrography is a traditional folk art in many parts of Europe, including [[Romania]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], and [[Flanders]], as well as [[Argentina]] and other areas in [[South America]].

==Equipment==
Traditional pyrography can be performed using any heated metal implement. Modern pyrography machines exist, and can be divided into three main categories.

===Solid-point burners===
Solid-point burners are similar in design to a [[soldering iron]]. They have a solid brass tip which is heated by an electrical element, and operate at a fixed temperature.

===Wire-nib burners===
Wire-nib burners have variable temperature controls. The writing nib is heated by an electric current passing directly through it. Some models have interchangeable nibs to allow for different effects.&lt;ref&gt;Walters, S; ''Pyrography Workbook: A Complete Guide to the Art of Woodburning'' Fox Chapel 2005 p13-14 {{ISBN|978-1-56523-258-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laser cutters===
[[Laser cutter]]s can be set to scorch the material instead of cutting all the way through it.  Many laser cutters provide software facilities to import image files and transfer them onto a sheet of wood.  Some laser systems are sufficiently sensitive to perform pyrography on thin card or even paper.

=== Woods === 
Woods differ in hardness, grain, figure, texture, color, and other physical characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, Nanette. "Woodburning Project &amp; Pattern Treasury: Create Your Own Pyrography Art With 70 Mix-And-Match Designs." Library Journal 137.4 (2012): 96. Academic Search Complete. Web. 2 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Hardness:''' All woods can be classified into hard or soft. Usually softwoods are from coniferous (needle-leaved) trees. You may be aware of a little bit of resin oozing and also, a slight turpentine smell when you burn on softwood. 

Hardwoods are from broad-leaved trees. These hardwood trees can be classified into two distinct growing seasons each year (hot and cold season or a wet and dry season) such as:
* Earlywood: normally lighter in color and weight and only moderately strong
* Latewood: usually heavier, darker, and stronger. 

Softwood will burn faster than a hardwood does. It does not require as hot a pen to burn as do the hardwoods. 

'''Grain:''' Grain is the direction of the fibrous elements of the wood cells. This is important to sand with the grain. Also the grain can cause deviation from its intended path with use of woodturning pen unless you apply more pressure and burn slower on the grain.

'''Figure:''' This is the natural design, or pattern, that you can see on the cut surface of the wood. The figure present on the wood should always be taken into consideration when you are planning your woodburned design. 

'''Texture:''' There is a texture on the surface of that wood that feels either coarse of fine, even or uneven. 

As a beginning woodburner, avoid using very fine or intricate designs on uneven, coarse-textured wood. Softwoods are more apt to be fine or moderately coarse-textured. With some textures it may mean that you will have to compensate when burning it – going slower on the harder summerwood, faster and with a lighter touch on the softer springwood to create an even burn overall.

'''Color:''' Woodburning should be mainly used to enhance the natural beauty of a wooden project, so do not always hide a beautiful figure, grain, luster, or color if it is present.

== Safety ==
The main hazard to be wary of is the extremely fine wood dust when sanding the wood or in some cases the pitch/sap or resin that emits harmful fumes when burning. All wood dust is hazardous &amp; can cause respiratory problems if you do not wear a mask, some more than others &amp; should be avoided. You should always wear a quality dust mask/respirator while power carving, and use a good dust collection system to avoid a lifetime injury to your lungs. These recommendations really are not just for power carving or sanding, but they should be used for burning as well. Remember:
* '''DO NOT''' burn on pressure-treated wood. It is treated with chemicals that, although safely bound in the wood fibers for construction purposes, are inherently dangerous to woodworkers and woodburners.
* '''DO NOT''' burn on any type of treated wood: Chemically treated, stained, painted, sealed with a finish, etc.  If you  must use this type of wood be sure that you have thoroughly sanded it to remove all traces and are burning on '''bare''' wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pyrography Materials and Safety Precautions|url = http://www.sawdustconnection.com/Pyrography-101-Tutorial-Pyrography-Safety.htm|website = www.sawdustconnection.com|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prepared Wood, Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF), man made boards and plywood should never really ever be burned on for several reasons. Prepared wood usually has been chemically treated and burning on it will release toxins into the air. MDF is made out of toxic materials and may cause cancer and other health issues. Man-made boards and such also have layers of glue that releases toxins that may not cause immediate harm but impact one later on in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lesson 2: A word about safety in Pyrography|url = http://hippiescreations.com/a-word-about-safety-in-pyrography/|website = The Art of Handmade|accessdate = 2015-10-19|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7109">'''''Scheherazade.2''''' is a dramatic [[symphony]] for solo [[violin]] and [[orchestra]] by the American composer [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]].  The work was jointly commissioned by the [[New York Philharmonic]], the [[Concertgebouw]] &amp; the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]], and the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]].  It was written specifically for the violinist [[Leila Josefowicz]], who performed its world premiere with the New York Philharmonic under [[Alan Gilbert (conductor)|Alan Gilbert]] at [[David Geffen Hall|Avery Fisher Hall]] on March 26, 2015.&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Adams |first=John |authorlink=John Adams (composer) |year=2014 |title=Scheherazade.2 |publisher=[[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] |url=http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/John-Adams-Scheherazade-2/57394 |accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=May |first=Thomas |title=Turning the 'Arabian Nights' on its head: John Adams conducts 'Scheherazade.2' at Seattle Symphony |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=March 10, 2016 |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/classical-music/turning-the-arabian-nights-on-its-head-john-adams-conducts-scheherazade2-at-seattle-symphony/ |accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
===Background===
Adams was inspired to write the piece after visiting an exhibit on the history of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' at the [[Arab World Institute]] in [[Paris]].  According to the score program note, the composer was struck by "the casual brutality toward women that lies at the base of many of these tales" and how women are still oppressed and abused in modern society.  He wrote, "In the old tale Scheherazade is the lucky one who, through her endless inventiveness, is able to save her life. But there is not much to celebrate here when one thinks that she is spared simply because of her cleverness and ability to keep on entertaining her warped, murderous husband."  Adams continued, "So I was suddenly struck by the idea of a 'dramatic symphony' in which the principal character role is taken by the solo violin—and she would be Scheherazade."  The symphony thus follows a loose narrative through "a set of provocative images" about a modern Scheherazade's struggle in a patriarchal society.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scheinin |first=Richard |title=John Adams talks jazz: a Q&amp;A |work=[[San Jose Mercury News]] |date=August 8, 2014 |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/music/ci_26300741/john-adams-talks-jazz-q |accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
''Scheherazade.2'' has a duration of roughly 50 minutes and is composed in four [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Tale of the Wise Young Woman – Pursuit by the True Believers
#A Long Desire (Love Scene)
#Scheherazade and the Men with Beards
#Escape, Flight, Sanctuary

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for solo violin and a large orchestra comprising two [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s, two [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horns]], two [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, three percussionists, two [[Pedal harp|harps]], [[cimbalom]], [[celesta]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
''Scheherazade.2'' has been praised by music critics.  Reviewing the world premiere, George Grella of the ''New York Classical Review'' called the piece "a welcome return to form for a composer who, at his best, doesn't just create satisfying music but extends the classical tradition."  He added, "This is a big sprawling piece, an attempt at a grand dramatic narrative that turns the central character of the ''Arabian Nights'' into a feminist heroine who rebels against a patriarchal society and finds her freedom. Adams is a storytelling composer, so along with the sheer sound and experience of the music, one listens for how well the story is told."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Grella |first=George |title=Aided by Josefowicz's fire, Adams returns to form with "Scheherazade.2" |work=New York Classical Review |date=March 27, 2015 |url=http://newyorkclassicalreview.com/2015/03/aided-by-josefowiczs-fire-adams-returns-to-form-with-scheherazade-2/ |accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The performance was also lauded by [[Anthony Tommasini]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who wrote, "Long an Adams champion, Ms. Josefowicz gave a dazzling and inspired performance, backed by the glittering, rhapsodic and supremely confident playing of the orchestra under Mr. Gilbert."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tommasini |first=Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Tommasini |title=Review: John Adams Unveils 'Scheherazade.2,' an Answer to Male Brutality |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 27, 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/arts/music/review-john-adams-unveils-scheherazade2-an-answer-to-male-brutality.html |accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing a later performance by Josefowicz and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] under the composer, Andrew Clements of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said the symphony "follows a convincing symphonic shape, with a dialectical first movement that contrasts different blocks of musical material, a sometimes anguished slow movement, fierce climactic scherzo, and a finale that gradually discharges the tension and finds quiet resolution."  He continued, "Adams’s music is as eclectic as ever; sometimes a bit soft-centred, perhaps, with solo-violin writing that does not go much beyond [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], but stuffed with allusions to a panoply of 20th-century models, with [[Olivier Messiaen|Messiaen]] the most surprising inclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clements |first=Andrew |title=LSO/Adams review – Josefowicz exceptional in feisty, symphonic Scheherazade update |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 30, 2015 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/30/lso-john-adams-review-leila-josefowicz-violin-scheherazade-2-barbican-london |accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Seal of the [[State of Utah]]''' was adopted on April 3, 1896, at the first regular session of the [[Utah State Legislature|Legislature]] (January, February, March, April 1896). The original [[Seal (device)|seal]] was designed by Harry Edwards &amp; C. M. Jackson and cost $65.00. The great seal is described in Utah Code Annotated, 1953, Volume 7a, section 67-2-9 as follows:

{{quote|"The Great Seal of the State of Utah shall be two and one-half inches in diameter, and of the following device; the center a shield and perched thereon an American Eagle with outstretching wings; the top of the shield pierced by six arrows crosswise; under the arrows the motto "INDUSTRY"; beneath the motto a beehive, on either side growing sego lilies; below the figures "1847"; on each side of the shield an American Flag.; encircling all, near the outer edge of the seal, beginning at the lower left-hand portion, the words, "THE GREAT SEAL OF THE STATE OF UTAH", with the figures "1896" at the base."}}

==Seal of the Governor==
[[File:Seal of the Governor of Utah (2011).svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Governor of Utah]]]]
There is also an official seal of the [[Governor of Utah]]. Borrowing most of the same symbolism from the state seal, the Governor's seal includes Roman numerals at the bottom, which represent the Governor himself, and this changes with every new Governor. Each Governor therefore has a seal unique to themselves and their administration. The Roman numerals are currently "XVII", representing [[Gary Herbert]], who is the 17th governor of Utah since statehood. The seal was designed after the California Governor's Seal by Ronald L. Fox of Salt Lake City, Utah in 1992.

==Enhanced Variant==
An artist at the Colonial Flag Company, produced the artwork for the corrected Utah State flag used during the Legislative process. The flag was drawn following the legal description and using the colors of the flag made for presentation to the {{USS|Utah|BB-31}} in 1912. Although colors were not included in the law describing the Utah State Flag as adopted in 1912 and amended in 1913, they were described in other state documents. Utah officials asked that those colors be used. However, they declined to include an illustration with the House Concurrent Resolution, saying that was not possible.

As with many flags with seals and coats of arms, there is room for artistic interpretation while still following correct designs. Paul Swenson, who as the President of Colonial Flag Company had paid for the prototype design, felt the eagle as shown in that design was weak and unattractive. He had graphic artist Perry Van Schelt strengthen the design while following the same description and using the same colors as employed in the prototype. Advisors in the project included John Hartvigsen, David Rindlisbach and Ronald L. Fox, Fox suggested the flag on the seal would have 45 stars divided between the two U.S. Flags shown on the seal, Utah was the 45th State. Both the prototype and the enhance designs are correct and follow the law and intent of the 2011 legislation. Only a few hundred flags were ordered using the prototype design, and most flags now being made and sold use the enhanced design, but legally flag manufacturers are free to use either version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loeser.us/flags/utah.html Utah State Flag 2011 (enhanced variant)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual selection''' is a mode of [[natural selection]] where members of one [[biological sex]] [[mate choice|choose mates]] of the other [[sex]] to [[mating|mate]] with (intersexual selection), and compete with members of the same sex for access to members of the opposite sex (intrasexual selection). These two forms of selection mean that some individuals have better [[reproductive success]] than others within a [[population]], either from being more attractive or preferring more attractive partners to produce [[offspring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biology: The Unity &amp; Diversity of Life |year=2013 |publisher=Cengage Learning |page=281 |author=Cecie Starr |edition=Ralph Taggart, Christine Evers, Lisa Starr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PHYS-20140129"&gt;{{cite news |last=Vogt |first=Yngve |title=Large testicles are linked to infidelity |url=http://phys.org/news/2014-01-large-testicles-linked-infidelity.html |date=January 29, 2014 |work=[[Phys.org]] |accessdate=January 31, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131114327/http://phys.org/news/2014-01-large-testicles-linked-infidelity.html |archivedate=January 31, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the breeding season, [[sexual selection in frogs]] occurs with the males first gathering at the water's edge and making their [[mating call]]s: croaking. The females then arrive and choose the males with the deepest croaks and best territories. Generalizing, males benefit from frequent mating and monopolizing access to a group of fertile females. Females have a limited number of offspring they can have and they maximize the return on the energy they invest in reproduction.

The concept was first articulated by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] who described it as driving species adaptations and that many organisms had evolved features whose function was deleterious to their individual survival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles |author2=A. R. Wallace |title=On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection |journal=Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London.

Sexual selection can, typically, lead males to extreme efforts to demonstrate their [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] to be chosen by females, producing [[sexual dimorphism]] in [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s, such as the ornate [[plumage]] of [[birds]] such as [[birds of paradise]] and  [[peafowl]], or the antlers of [[deer]], or the manes of [[lion]]s, caused by a [[positive feedback]] mechanism known as a [[Fisherian runaway]], where the passing-on of the desire for a trait in one sex is as important as having the trait in the other sex in producing the runaway effect. Although the [[sexy son hypothesis]] indicates that females would prefer male offspring, [[Fisher's principle]] explains why the [[sex ratio]] is 1:1 almost without exception. Sexual selection is also found in [[plant]]s and [[fungi]].

The maintenance of sexual reproduction in a highly competitive world is one of the major puzzles in biology given that [[asexual reproduction]] can reproduce much more quickly as 50% of offspring are not males, unable to produce offspring themselves. Many non-exclusive hypotheses have been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hartfield |first1=Matthew |author2=P. D.

== History ==

=== Darwin ===
Sexual selection was first proposed by Charles Darwin in ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' (1859) and developed in ''[[The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' (1871), as he felt that natural selection alone was unable to account for certain types of non-survival adaptations. He once wrote to a colleague that "The sight of a feather in a [[peahen|peacock]]'s tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick!" His work divided sexual selection into male-male competition and female choice.

{{quote|... depends, not on a struggle for existence, but on a struggle between the males for possession of the females; the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring.&lt;ref name=origin&gt;Darwin, Charles (1859). On the Origin of Species (1st edition). Chapter 4, page 88. "And this leads me to say a few words on what I call Sexual Selection. This depends ..." {{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=12 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105031643/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=12 |archivedate=2011-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|... when the males and females of any animal have the same general habits ... but differ in structure, colour, or ornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1859). On the Origin of Species (1st edition). Chapter 4, page 89. {{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=12 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105031643/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=12 |archivedate=2011-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These views were to some extent opposed by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], mostly after Darwin's death. He accepted that sexual selection could occur, but argued that it was a relatively weak form of selection. He argued that male-male competitions were forms of natural selection, but that the "drab" peahen's coloration is itself adaptive as [[camouflage]]. In his opinion, ascribing mate choice to females was attributing the ability to judge standards of beauty to animals (such as [[beetle]]s) far too cognitively undeveloped to be capable of [[aesthetic]] feeling.&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallace|first1=Alfred Russel|title=Note on Sexual Selection (S459: 1892)|url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S459.htm|publisher=Smith, Charles|accessdate=13 January 2017|date=1892|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217215250/http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S459.htm|archivedate=17 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ronald Fisher ===

[[Ronald Fisher]], the [[England|English]] [[statistician]] and [[evolutionary biologist]] developed a number of ideas about sexual selection in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'' including the [[sexy son hypothesis]] and [[Fisher's principle]]. The [[Fisherian runaway]] describes how sexual selection accelerates the preference for a specific ornament, causing the preferred trait and female preference for it to increase together in a [[positive feedback]] runaway cycle. In a remark that was not widely understood&lt;ref name=Blind /&gt; for another 50 years he said:

{{quote|... plumage development in the male, and sexual preference for such developments in the female, must thus advance together, and so long as the process is unchecked by severe counterselection, will advance with ever-increasing speed. In the total absence of such checks, it is easy to see that the speed of development will be proportional to the development already attained, which will therefore increase with time [[exponential growth|exponentially]], or in [[geometric progression]]. —''Ronald Fisher, 1930''}}

[[File:South Africa-Tshwane-Rietvlei-Long-tailed Widowbird-01 cropped.jpg|thumb|Male [[long-tailed widowbird]]]]

This causes a dramatic increase in both the male's conspicuous feature and in female preference for it, resulting in marked [[sexual dimorphism]], until practical physical constraints halt further exaggeration. A [[positive feedback]] loop is created, producing extravagant physical structures in the non-limiting sex. A classic example of female choice and potential runaway selection is the [[long-tailed widowbird]]. While males have long tails that are selected for by female choice, female tastes in tail length are still more extreme with females being attracted to tails longer than those that naturally occur.&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, M, Sexual Selection, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher understood that female preference for long tails may be passed on genetically, in conjunction with genes for the long tail itself. Long-tailed widowbird offspring of both sexes inherit both sets of genes, with females [[Gene expression|expressing]] their genetic preference for long tails, and males showing off the coveted long tail itself.&lt;ref name=Blind /&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]] presents a non-mathematical explanation of the runaway sexual selection process in his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''.&lt;ref name=Blind&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1986). [https://books.google.com/books?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sexual%20selection%22&amp;f=false The Blind Watchmaker]. Longman, London. Published in Penguin Books 1988, 1991, and 2006. Chapter 8, Explosions and Spirals.&lt;/ref&gt; Females that prefer long tailed males tend to have mothers that chose long-tailed fathers. As a result, they carry both sets of genes in their bodies. That is, genes for long tails and for preferring long tails become [[Linkage disequilibrium|linked]]. The taste for long tails and tail length itself may therefore become correlated, tending to increase together. The more tails lengthen, the more long tails are desired. Any slight initial imbalance between taste and tails may set off an explosion in tail lengths. Fisher wrote that:

{{quote|The exponential element, which is the kernel of the thing, arises from the rate of change in hen taste being proportional to the absolute average degree of taste. —''Ronald Fisher, 1932''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Fisher]] in a letter to [[Charles Galton Darwin]], 22 November 1932, cited in Fisher, R. A., Bennett, J. H. 1999. ''The genetical theory of natural selection: A complete variorum edition'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Peacock Flying.jpg|thumb|The peacock tail in flight, the classic example of a [[Fisherian runaway]]]]

The female widow bird chooses to mate with the most attractive long-tailed male so that her progeny, if male, will themselves be attractive to females of the next generation - thereby fathering many offspring that carry the female's genes. Since the rate of change in preference is proportional to the average taste amongst females, and as females desire to secure the services of the most sexually attractive males, an additive effect is created that, if unchecked, can yield exponential increases in a given taste and in the corresponding desired sexual attribute.

{{quote|It is important to notice that the conditions of relative stability brought about by these or other means, will be far longer duration than the process in which the ornaments are evolved. In most existing species the runaway process must have been already checked, and we should expect that the more extraordinary developments of sexual plumage are not due like most characters to a long and even course of evolutionary progress, but to sudden spurts of change. —''Ronald Fisher, 1930''}}

Since Fisher's initial conceptual model of the 'runaway' process, Russell Lande&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Lande | first1=R. | year=1981 | title=Models of speciation by sexual selection on polygenic traits | url=| journal=PNAS | volume=78 | issue=6| pages=3721–3725 | doi=10.1073/pnas.78.6.3721 | pmid=16593036 | pmc=319643 }} {{cite web |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/78/6/3721 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612012041/http://www.pnas.org/content/78/6/3721 |archivedate=2013-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peter O'Donald&lt;ref&gt;O'Donald, Peter (1980). Genetic Models of Sexual Selection. Cambridge University Press, New York, NY. 250 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; have provided detailed mathematical proofs that define the circumstances under which runaway sexual selection can take place.

==Theory==
===Reproductive success===
[[File:Irish Elk front.jpg|thumb|right|Extinct [[Irish elk]] (''Megaloceros giganteus''). These antlers span {{convert|2.7|m|ft}} and have a mass of {{convert|40|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.]]

The [[reproductive success]] of an organism is measured by the number of [[offspring]] left behind, and their quality or probable [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].

Sexual preference creates a tendency towards [[assortative mating]] or [[homogamy (biology)|homogamy]]. The general conditions of sexual discrimination appear to be (1) the acceptance of one mate precludes the effective acceptance of alternative mates, and (2) the rejection of an offer is followed by other offers, either certainly, or at such high chance that the risk of non-occurrence is smaller than the chance advantage to be gained by selecting a mate.

The conditions determining which sex becomes the more limited resource in intersexual have been hypothesized with the [[Bateman's principle]], which states that the sex which invests the most in producing offspring becomes a limiting resource over which the other sex competes, illustrated by the greater [[parental investment|nutritional investment]] of an egg in a [[zygote]], and the limited capacity of females to reproduce; for example, in humans, a woman can only give birth every ten months, whereas a male can become a father numerous times.

===Modern interpretation===

The sciences of [[evolutionary psychology]], [[human behavioural ecology]], and [[sociobiology]] study the influence of sexual selection in humans.

Darwin's ideas on sexual selection were met with scepticism by his contemporaries and not considered of great importance in the early 20th century, until in the 1930s biologists decided to include sexual selection as a mode of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Miller, Geoffey]], The Mating Mind, p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the 21st century have they become more important in [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://edge.org/conversation/sexual-selection-and-the-mind Sexual Selection and the Mind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610185636/https://edge.org/conversation/sexual-selection-and-the-mind |date=2015-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory however is generally applicable and analogous to natural selection.&lt;ref name="Hosken2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hosken|first1=David J.|last2=House|first2=Clarissa M.|title=Sexual Selection|journal=Current Biology|date=January 2011|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.11.053|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982210015198|volume=21|pages=R62–R65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tribolium castaneum87-300.jpg|thumb|Flour beetle]]
[[File:Tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus).jpg|thumb|Tungara frog]]

Research in 2015 indicates that sexual selection, including [[mate choice]], "improves population health and protects against extinction, even in the face of genetic stress from high levels of inbreeding" and "ultimately dictates who gets to reproduce their genes into the next generation - so it's a widespread and very powerful evolutionary force." The study involved the [[flour beetle]] over a ten-year period where the only changes were in the intensity of sexual selection.&lt;ref name="popben"/&gt;

Another theory, the [[handicap principle]] of [[Amotz Zahavi]], [[Russell Lande]] and [[W. D. Hamilton]], holds that the fact that the male is able to survive until and through the age of reproduction with such a seemingly maladaptive trait is taken by the female to be a testament to his overall fitness. Such handicaps might prove he is either free of or resistant to [[disease]], or that he possesses more speed or a greater physical strength that is used to combat the troubles brought on by the exaggerated trait. Zahavi's work spurred a re-examination of the field, which has produced an ever-accelerating number of theories. In 1984, Hamilton and [[Marlene Zuk]] introduced the "Bright Male" hypothesis, suggesting that male elaborations might serve as a marker of health, by exaggerating the effects of disease and deficiency. In 1990, Michael Ryan and A.S. Rand, working with the [[tungara frog]], proposed the hypothesis of "Sensory Exploitation", where exaggerated male traits may provide a sensory stimulation that females find hard to resist. Subsequently, the theories of the "Gravity Hypothesis" by Jordi Moya-Larano et al. (2002), invoking a simple biomechanical model to account for the adaptive value for smaller male spiders of speed in clmbing vertical surfaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01335.x | volume=21 | title=Gravity still matters | year=2007 | journal=Functional Ecology | pages=1178–1181 | last1 = Moya-Laraño | first1 = J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Chase Away" by Brett Holland and William R. Rice have been added. In the late 1970s, Janzen and Mary Willson, noting that male flowers are often larger than female flowers, expanded the field of sexual selection into [[plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Mary F|date=June 1979|title=Sexual Selection In Plants|url=|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=113, No. 6|pages=777-790|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past few years, the field has exploded to include other areas of study, not all of which fit Darwin's definition of sexual selection. These include [[cuckold]]ry, nuptial gifts, [[sperm competition]], [[infanticide]] (especially [[infanticide in primates|in primates]]), physical [[beauty]], mating by subterfuge, species isolation mechanisms, male parental care, ambiparental care, mate location, polygamy, and homosexual rape in certain male animals.

Focusing on the effect of [[sexual conflict]], as hypothesized by William Rice, Locke Rowe et Göran Arnvist, [[Thierry Lodé]] argues that divergence of interest constitutes a key for evolutionary process. Sexual conflict leads to an [[antagonistic co-evolution]] in which one sex tends to control the other, resulting in a tug of war. Besides, ''the sexual propaganda theory'' only argued that mates were opportunistically lead, on the basis of various factors determining the choice such as phenotypic characteristics, apparent vigour of individuals, strength of mate signals, trophic resources, territoriality etc. and could explain the maintenance of genetic diversity within populations.&lt;ref&gt;Thierry Lodé (2006). "La guerre des sexes chez les animaux " Eds Odile Jacob, Paris. {{ISBN|2-7381-1901-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several workers have brought attention to the fact that elaborated characters that ought to be costly in one way or another for their bearers (e.g., the [[tail]]s of some species of [[Xiphophorus]] fish) do not always appear to have a cost in terms of energetics, performance or even survival. One possible explanation for the apparent lack of costs is that "compensatory traits" have evolved in concert with the sexually selected traits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/sexual_selection_costs/story.htm Sexual Selection Costs &amp; Compensations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606234023/http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/sexual_selection_costs/story.htm |date=2014-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toolkit of natural selection===
[[File:Protarchaeopteryx 4713.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Protarchaeopteryx]]'' - skull based on ''[[Incisivosaurus]]'' and wings on ''[[Caudipteryx]]'']]

Sexual selection may explain how certain characteristics (such as feathers) had distinct survival value at an early stage in their evolution. [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] proposes that sexual selection might have contributed by creating evolutionary modules such as ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' feathers as sexual ornaments, at first. The earliest proto-birds such as China's ''[[Protarchaeopteryx]]'', discovered in the early 1990s, had well-developed feathers but no sign of the top/bottom asymmetry that gives wings lift. Some have suggested that the feathers served as insulation, helping females incubate their eggs. But perhaps the feathers served as the kinds of sexual ornaments still common in most bird species, and especially in birds such as peacocks and [[birds-of-paradise]] today. If proto-bird courtship displays combined displays of forelimb feathers with energetic jumps, then the transition from display to aerodynamic functions could have been relatively smooth.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt;

Sexual selection sometimes generates features that may help cause a species' extinction, as has been suggested&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, Geoffrey (2000). The Mating Mind.

===Sexual dimorphism===
{{uncited section|date=November 2017}}
{{main article|Sexual dimorphism}}

Sex differences directly related to reproduction and serving no direct purpose in [[courtship]] are called [[primary sexual characteristics]]. Traits amenable to sexual selection, which give an organism an advantage over its rivals (such as in courtship) without being directly involved in [[reproduction]], are called [[secondary sex characteristic]]s.

[[Image:Descent of Man - Figure 16.jpg|thumb|The [[rhinoceros beetle]] is a classic case of [[sexual dimorphism]]. Plate from Darwin's ''[[Descent of Man]]'', male at top, female at bottom]]

In most sexual species the [[males]] and [[females]] have different [[Nash equilibrium|equilibrium]] strategies, due to a difference in relative investment in producing offspring. As formulated in Bateman's principle, females have a greater initial investment in producing offspring ([[pregnancy]] in mammals or the production of the egg in [[birds]] and [[reptiles]]), and this difference in initial investment creates differences in variance in expected reproductive success and bootstraps the sexual selection processes. Classic examples of reversed sex-role species include the [[pipefish]], and [[Wilson's phalarope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sagebakken|first=Gry|last2=Kvarnemo|first2=Charlotta|last3=Ahnesjö|first3=Ingrid|date=2017-03-22|title=Nutritional state – a survival kit for brooding pipefish fathers|url=https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/121/2/312/3077155|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|language=en|volume=121|issue=2|pages=312–318|doi=10.1093/biolinnean/blx002|issn=0024-4066}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, unlike a female, a male (except in [[monogamous]] species) has some uncertainty about whether or not he is the true parent of a child, and so is less interested in spending his energy helping to raise offspring that may or may not be related to him. As a result of these factors, males are typically more willing to mate than females, and so females are typically the ones doing the choosing (except in cases of [[forced copulation]]s, which can occur in certain species of [[primate]]s, [[duck]]s, and others). The effects of sexual selection are thus held to typically be more pronounced in males than in females.

Differences in secondary sexual characteristics between males and females of a species are referred to as [[sexual dimorphism]]s. These can be as subtle as a size difference (sexual size dimorphism, often abbreviated as SSD) or as extreme as horns and colour patterns. Sexual dimorphisms abound in nature. Examples include the possession of antlers by only male [[deer]], the brighter coloration of many male birds in comparison with females of the same species, or even more distinct differences in basic morphology, such as the drastically increased eye-span of the male [[stalk-eyed fly]]. The [[peacock]], with its elaborate and colourful tail feathers, which the [[peahen]] lacks, is often referred to as perhaps the most extraordinary example of a dimorphism. Male and female [[black-throated blue warbler]]s and [[Guianan cock-of-the-rock]]s also differ radically in their plumage. Early naturalists even believed the females to be a separate species. The largest sexual size dimorphism in [[vertebrates]] is the [[shell dwellers|shell dwelling]] [[cichlid]] [[fish]] ''[[Neolamprologus callipterus]]'' in which males are up to 30 times the size of females&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ota|first=Kazutaka|last2=Kohda|first2=Masanori|last3=Sato|first3=Tetsu|date=2010-05-01|title=Unusual allometry for sexual size dimorphism in a cichlid where males are extremely larger than females|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12038-010-0030-6|journal=Journal of Biosciences|language=en|volume=35|issue=2|pages=257–265|doi=10.1007/s12038-010-0030-6|issn=0250-5991}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many other fish such as [[guppy|guppies]] also exhibit sexual dimorphism. Extreme sexual size dimorphism, with females larger than males, is quite common in [[spiders]] and [[birds of prey]].

== The Role of Male-Male Competition in Sexual Selection ==
Male-male competition is when two males of the same species compete for the opportunity to mate with a female. [[Sexual dimorphism|Sexually dimorphic]] traits, size, sex ratio &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weir|first=Laura K.|date=2012-11-22|title=Male–male competition and alternative male mating tactics influence female behavior and fertility in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00265-012-1438-9|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=67|issue=2|pages=193–203|doi=10.1007/s00265-012-1438-9|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the social situation &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=PROCTER|first=D.

=== Conditions that Influence Competition ===

==== Sex Ratio ====
[[File:Oryzias_latipes(Hamamatsu,Shizuoka,Japan,2007)-1.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Oryzias_latipes(Hamamatsu,Shizuoka,Japan,2007)-1.jpg|thumb|Janapese medaka, ''Orzyas latipes''.]]
There are multiple types of male-male competition that may occur in a population at different times depending on the conditions. Competition variation occurs based on the frequency of various mating behaviours present in the population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One factor that can influence the type of competition observed is the population density of males.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When there is a high density of males present in the population, competition tends to be less aggressive and therefore sneak tactics and disruptions techniques are more often employed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  These techniques often indicate a type of competition referred to as scramble competition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Japanese medaka, ''[[Japanese rice fish|Oryzias latipes]]'', sneaking behaviours refer to when a male interrupts a mating pair during copulation by grasping on to either the male or the female and releasing their own sperm in the hopes of being the one to fertilize the female.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Disruption is a technique which involves one male bumping the male that is copulating with the female away just before his sperm is released and the eggs are fertilized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, all techniques are not equally successful when in competition for reproductive success. Disruption results in a shorter copulation period and can therefore disrupt the fertilization of the eggs by the sperm, which frequently results in lower rates of fertilization and smaller clutch size.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Resource Value and Social Ranking ====
Another factor that can influence male-male competition is the value of the resource to competitors. Male-male competition can pose many risks to a male's fitness, such as high energy expenditure, physical injury, lower sperm quality and lost paternity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson-Flower|first=Martha J.|last2=Ridley|first2=Amanda R.|date=2015-09-24|title=Male-male competition is not costly to dominant males in a cooperatively breeding bird|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00265-015-2011-0|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=69|issue=12|pages=1997–2004|doi=10.1007/s00265-015-2011-0|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of competition must therefore be worth the value of the resource. A male is more likely to engage in competition for a resource that improves their reproductive success if the resource value is higher. While male-male competition can occur in the presence or absence of a female, competition occurs more frequently in the presence of a female.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The presence of a female directly increases the resource value of a territory or shelter and so the males are more likely to accept the risk of competition when a female is present.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The smaller males of a species are also more likely to engage in competition with larger males in the presence of a female.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to the higher level of risk for subordinate males, they tend to engage in competition less frequently than larger, more dominant males and therefore breed less frequently than dominant males.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is seen in many species, such as the Omei treefrog, ''[[Rhacophorus omeimontis]],'' where larger males obtained more mating opportunities and successfully mated with larger mates. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luo|first=Zhenhua|last2=Li|first2=Chenliang|last3=Wang|first3=Hui|last4=Shen|first4=Hang|last5=Zhao|first5=Mian|last6=Gu|first6=Qi|last7=Liao|first7=Chunlin|last8=Gu|first8=Zhirong|last9=Wu|first9=Hua|date=2016-02-23|title=Male-male competition drives sexual selection and group spawning in the Omei treefrog, Rhacophorus omeimontis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00265-016-2078-2|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=70|issue=4|pages=593–605|doi=10.1007/s00265-016-2078-2|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Winner-Loser Effects ====
A third factor that can impact the success of a male in competition is [[Winner and loser effects|winner-loser effects]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeng|first=Yang|last2=Zhou|first2=Feng-Hao|last3=Zhu|first3=Dao-Hong|date=2018-06-26|title=Fight outcome briefly affects the reproductive fitness of male crickets|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27866-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27866-4|issn=2045-2322|pmc=6018733|pmid=29946077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burrowing crickets, ''velarifictorous aspersus,'' compete for burrows to attract females using their large mandibles for fighting. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Female burrowing crickets, are more likely to choose winner of a competition in the 2 hours after the fight.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The presence winning male suppresses mating behaviours of the losing males because the winning male tends to produce more frequent and enhanced mating calls in this period of time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Effect of Male-Male Competition on Female Fitness ===
Male-male competition can both positively and negatively affect female fitness. When there is a high density of males in a population and a large number of males attempting to mate with the female, she is more likely to resist mating attempts, resulting in lower fertilization rates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; High levels of male-male competition can also result in a reduction in female investment in mating.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many forms of competition can also cause significant distress for the female negatively impacting her ability to reproduce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An increase in male-male competition can affect a females ability to select the best mates, and therefore decrease the likelihood of successful reproduction.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cayuela|first=Hugo|last2=Lengagne|first2=Thierry|last3=Kaufmann|first3=Bernard|last4=Joly|first4=Pierre|last5=Léna|first5=Jean-Paul|date=2016-06-24|title=Larval competition risk shapes male–male competition and mating behavior in an anuran|url=https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/27/6/1726/2453477|journal=Behavioral Ecology|language=en|volume=27|issue=6|pages=arw100|doi=10.1093/beheco/arw100|issn=1045-2249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some techniques can improve the fitness of the female. Group mating can positively affect the fitness of a female in Japanese medaka due to an increase in genetic variation, a higher likelihood of paternal care and a higher likelihood of successful fertilization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Examples ===
[[File:Narnia_femorata_P1080912a.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Narnia_femorata_P1080912a.jpg|thumb|A leaf-footed cactus bug, ''Narnia femorata.'']]
In Japanese medaka, females mate daily during mating season.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Males compete for the opportunity to mate with the female by displaying themselves aggressively and chasing each other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To obtain the selection of the females, they court the females prior to copulation by performing a courting behaviour referred to as "quick circles".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In [[Coreidae|leaf-footed cactus bugs]], ''Narnia femorata'', males compete for territories where females can lay their eggs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Males compete more intensely for cacti territories with fruit to attract females. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this species, the males possess sexually dimorphic traits, such as their larger size and hind legs, which are used to gain the most advantage over competitors when females are present, but are not used in the absence of females.

Anuran (such as [[Frog|frogs]]) select habitats (pools) free of conspecifics in order to minimize male-male competition for both themselves and their offspring.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Displays are used in attempt to keep competitors out of their territory and deter sneaking behaviours, while fighting is only used when necessary due to the high costs and risks associated with fighting.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Today, biologists say that certain evolutionary traits can be explained by [[intraspecific competition]] - competition between members of the same species - distinguishing between competition before or after [[sexual intercourse]].

[[File:Descent of Man fig48.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration from ''The Descent of Man'' showing the [[tufted coquette]] ''Lophornis ornatus'': female on left, ornamented male on right]]

Before [[sexual intercourse|copulation]], ''intrasexual selection'' - usually between males - may take the form of ''male-to-male combat''. Also, ''intersexual selection'', or ''[[mate choice]]'', occurs when females choose between male mates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Campbell | first1=N. A. | author2=J. B.

Due to their sometimes greatly exaggerated nature, secondary sexual characteristics can prove to be a hindrance to an animal, thereby lowering its chances of survival. For example, the large antlers of a moose are bulky and heavy and slow the creature's flight from predators; they also can become entangled in low-hanging tree branches and shrubs, and undoubtedly have led to the demise of many individuals. Bright colourations and showy ornamenations, such as those seen in many male birds, in addition to capturing the eyes of females, also attract the attention of predators. Some of these traits also represent energetically costly investments for the animals that bear them.  Because traits held to be due to sexual selection often conflict with the survival fitness of the individual, the question then arises as to why, in nature, in which [[survival of the fittest]] is considered the rule of thumb, such apparent liabilities are allowed to persist. However, one must also consider that intersexual selection can occur with an emphasis on resources that one sex possesses rather than morphological and physiological differences. For example, males of ''[[Euglossa imperialis]]'', a non-social bee species, form aggregations of territories considered to be leks, to defend fragrant-rich primary territories. The purpose of these aggregations is only facultative, since the more suitable fragrant-rich sites there are, the more habitable territories there are to inhabit, giving females of this species a large selection of males with whom to potentially mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kimsey | first1 = Lynn Siri | year = 1980 | title = The behaviour of male orchid bees (Apidae, Hymenoptera, Insecta) and the question of leks | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 28 | issue = 4| pages = 996–1004 | doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(80)80088-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After copulation, male–male competition distinct from conventional [[aggression]] may take the form of [[sperm competition]], as described by [[Geoff Parker|Parker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Parker | first1=Geoffrey A. | authorlink=Geoff Parker | year=1970 | title=Sperm competition and its evolutionary consequences in the insects | url=| journal=[[Biological Reviews]] | volume=45 | pages=525–567 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1970.tb01176.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1970. More recently, interest has arisen in [[Female sperm storage|''cryptic'' female choice]],&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard, WG. (1996) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=A0kcDzAlYy4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Female control: Sexual selection by cryptic female choice].'' Princeton, Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; a phenomenon of internally fertilised animals such as mammals and birds, where a female can get rid of a male's [[sperm]] without his knowledge.

[[File:Darwin sexual caricature.gif|thumb|upright|Victorian cartoonists quickly picked up on Darwin's ideas about display in sexual selection. Here he is fascinated by the apparent [[steatopygia]] in the latest fashion.]]

Finally, [[sexual conflict]] is said to occur between breeding partners,&lt;ref&gt;Locke Rowe, Göran Arnvist. (2013) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3g0fAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Sexual conflict]'', Princeton Univ Press. {{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes leading to an [[evolutionary arms race]] between males and females. Sexual selection can also occur as a product of [[pheromone]] release, such as with the stingless bee, ''[[Trigona corvina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Trail Pheromone of a Stingless Bee, Trigona corvina (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponini), Varies between Populations |url=http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/7/593 |journal=Chemical Senses |date=2010 |issn=0379-864X |pmid=20534775 |pages=593–601 |volume=35 |issue=7 |doi=10.1093/chemse/bjq057 |first=Stefan |last=Jarau |first2=Jochen |last2=Dambacher |first3=Robert |last3=Twele |first4=Ingrid |last4=Aguilar |first5=Wittko |last5=Francke |first6=Manfred |last6=Ayasse |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101123601/http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/7/593 |archivedate=2016-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female mating preferences are widely recognized as being responsible for the rapid and divergent evolution of male secondary sexual traits.&lt;ref&gt;Andersson M (1994). Sexual Selection. Princeton Univ Press, Princeton, NJ. {{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females of many animal species prefer to mate with males with external ornaments - exaggerated features of morphology such as elaborate sex organs. These preferences may arise when an arbitrary female preference for some aspect of male morphology — initially, perhaps, a result of [[genetic drift]] — creates, in due course, selection for males with the appropriate ornament. One interpretation of this is known as the [[sexy son hypothesis]]. Alternatively, genes that enable males to develop impressive ornaments or fighting ability may simply show off greater [[immune system|disease resistance]] or a more efficient [[metabolism]], features that also benefit females. This idea is known as the [[sexy son hypothesis#Good genes theory|good genes hypothesis]].

Bright colors that develop in animals during mating season function to attract partners. It has been suggested that there is a causal link between strength of display of ornaments involved in sexual selection and free radical biology.&lt;ref name="pmid10081154"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=von Schantz T, Bensch S, Grahn M, Hasselquist D, Wittzell H |title=Good genes, oxidative stress and condition-dependent sexual signals |journal=Proc.

Sci. |volume=266 |issue=1414 |pages=1–12 |date=January 1999 |pmid=10081154 |pmc=1689644 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0597 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To test this idea, experiments were performed on male [[Ctenophorus pictus|painted dragon lizards]].&lt;ref name="pmid22834746"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olsson M, Tobler M, Healey M, Perrin C, Wilson M |title=A significant component of ageing (DNA damage) is reflected in fading breeding colors: an experimental test using innate antioxidant mimetics in painted dragon lizards |journal=Evolution |volume=66 |issue=8 |pages=2475–83 |date=August 2012 |pmid=22834746 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01617.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Male lizards are brightly conspicuous in their breeding coloration, but their color declines with aging.  Experiments involving administration of [[antioxidant]]s to these males led to the conclusion that breeding coloration is a reflection of innate [[antioxidant|anti-oxidation]] capacity that protects against [[oxidative stress|oxidative damage]], including [[DNA oxidation|oxidative DNA damage]].&lt;ref name="pmid22834746" /&gt;   Thus color could act as a “health certificate” that allows females to visualize the underlying [[oxidative stress]] induced damage in potential mates.

Darwin conjectured that [[Heritability|heritable]] traits such as beards and hairlessness in different human populations are results of [[sexual selection in humans]]. [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] has hypothesized that many human behaviours not clearly tied to survival benefits, such as humour, music, visual art, verbal creativity, and some forms of [[altruism]], are courtship adaptations that have been favoured through sexual selection. In that view, many human artefacts could be considered subject to sexual selection as part of the [[extended phenotype]], for instance clothing that enhances sexually selected traits. Some argue that the [[evolution of human intelligence]] is a sexually selected trait, as it would not confer enough fitness in itself relative to its high maintenance costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000062 PLoS ONE: Sexual Selection and the Evolution of Brain Size in Primates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013143/http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchArticle.action?articleURI=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000062 |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. Please do not add personal recipes for stain removal without citing.--&gt;
A '''stain''' is a discoloration that can be clearly distinguished from the surface, material, or medium it is found upon. They are caused by the chemical or physical interaction of two dissimilar materials. Staining is used for [[staining (biology)|biochemical research]], metal staining, and [[art]] (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[wood staining]], [[stained glass]]).

==Types==
There can be intentional stains (such as [[wood]] stains or [[paint]]),&lt;ref name="stainbook"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Understanding Wood Finishing: How to Select and Apply the Right Finish | author = Bob Flexner | journal = Reader's Digest | date = 1999 | pages = 121 | isbn = 978-0-7621-0191-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicative stains (such as [[food coloring]] or adding a substance to make [[bacteria]] visible under a [[microscope]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Staining Procedures Used by the Biological Stain Commission: Published for the Biological Stain Commission | author = George Clark, James W. Bartholomew | publisher = Williams &amp; Wilkins | date = 1981 | pages = 32–33 | isbn = 978-0-683-01707-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; natural stains (such as [[rust]] on iron or a [[patina]] on [[bronze]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Architectural Metals: A Guide to Selection, Specification, and Performance | author = [[L. William Zahner]] | publisher = Wiley | date = 1997 | page = 101 | isbn = 978-0-471-04506-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accidental stains such as [[ketchup]] on a shirt.

Different types of material can be stained by different substances, and stain resistance is an important characteristic in modern [[textile engineering]].

==Formation==
The primary method of stain formation is surface stains, where the staining substance is spilled out onto the surface or material and is trapped in the fibers, pores, indentations, or other capillary structures on the surface.&lt;ref name="stainbook" /&gt; The material that is trapped coats the underlying material, and the stain reflects back light according to its own color. Applying paint, spilled food, and wood stains are of this nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Materials Performance | author = NACE International | publisher = National Association of Corrosion Engineers | date = 1987 | volume = 26 | page = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A secondary method of stain involves a [[chemical reaction|chemical]] or molecular reaction between the material and the staining material. Many types of natural stains fall into this category.

Finally, there can also be molecular attraction between the material and the staining material, involving being held in a [[covalent bond]] and showing the color of the bound substance.&lt;ref name="stainbook2"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Stain Removal Handbook | author = Max Alth, Simon Alth | publisher = Hawthorn Books | date = 1977 | page = 22 | isbn = 978-0-8015-7071-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
In many cases, stains are affected by [[heat]] and may become reactive enough to bond with the underlying material. Extreme heat, such as from [[ironing]] or [[dry cleaning]], can cause a chemical reaction on an otherwise removable stain, turning it into a chemical compound that is impossible to remove.&lt;ref name="stainbook2" /&gt;

==Removal==
Various [[laundry]] techniques exist to attempt to remove or minimize existing stains, and [[Stain removal|stain remover]]s are an important type of chemical in [[laundry detergent]]s. Some stand-alone stain removers also exist. If the wrong technique is used to remove the stain or stain mark on the clothing it could actually cause permanent damage to the clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laundrycares.com/laundry-stain-removal/ Solutions for Clothing and Laundry Stain Removal]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tennessee Williams]] and [[Myrna Loy]] were two of the original board members.

==Achievements==
The first full production at this [[off-Broadway]] theatre was ''[[The Old Glory]]'', a trilogy of three one-acts by the poet [[Robert Lowell]], produced in November 1964. The play would go on to win five [[Obie Award]]s the following year, including "Best American Play."&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.macmillan.com/theoldglory/RobertLowell Publisher's play synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/obies/index/1965/ Obie Awards for 1965]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to producing Robert Lowell's first play, The American Place Theatre has produced and developed the first plays of outstanding writers from other literary forms including [[Donald Barthelme]], [[Robert Coover]], [[Paul Goodman]], [[H. L. Mencken]], [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[S. J. Perelman]], [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Anne Sexton]], [[May Swenson]], and [[Robert Penn Warren]].

Significant playwrights have been nurtured and, in many cases, initially produced at The American Place, such as:
* [[Sam Shepard]] (8 plays including one co-authored with [[Joseph Chaikin]])
* [[Ronald Ribman]] (6)
* [[Steve Tesich]] (6)
* [[María Irene Fornés]] (4 including one produced as part of The Women’s Project)
* [[Ed Bullins]] (5)
* [[Phillip Hayes Dean]] (3)
* [[William Hauptman]] (3)
* [[Jonathan Reynolds]] (4)
* [[William Alfred]]
* [[Emily Mann (director)|Emily Mann]]
* [[Richard Nelson (playwright)|Richard Nelson]]
* [[Frank Chin]], the first Asian American to have plays produced by a mainstream New York company (''[[The Chickencoop Chinaman]]'' and ''[[The Year of the Dragon (play)|The Year of the Dragon]]'')

Also, major attention has been brought to unconventional, contemporary actor/writers such as [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Bill Irwin]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Aasif Mandvi]], and [[Dael Orlandersmith]].

==History==
The American Place Theatre played an important role in the emerging [[African-American]] theatre beginning in the early 1960s by producing the first productions of plays by [[Michael Bradford]], [[Ed Bullins]], [[Kia Corthron]], James de Jongh, Joseph Edward, [[Lonne Elder III]], Phillip Hayes Dean, Elaine Jackson, Alonzo D. Lamont Jr., [[Ron Milner]], Matt Robinson, [[Charlie L. Russell]], and Vincent Smith.

Its American Humorists' Series has transferred from the page to live performance the work of outstanding humorous writers, among them [[George Ade]], [[Robert Benchley]], [[Roy Blount Jr.]], [[A. Whitney Brown]], [[Jules Feiffer]], [[Bruce Jay Friedman]], [[Cynthia Heimel]], [[Dorothy Parker]], [[Roger Rosenblatt]], [[Damon Runyon]], [[Jean Shepherd]], [[James Thurber]], and [[Calvin Trillin]].

The theatre later moved to 111 West 46th Street. In 1978, The Women's Project, directed by Julia Miles, was designed to encourage, develop, and produce women playwrights and directors. After nine years of producing many groundbreaking works at The American Place Theatre, the project grew into a separate entity, [[Women's Project Theater]].

Actors for whom The American Place Theatre has been a launching pad include [[Mary Alice]], [[Ellen Barkin]], [[Roscoe Lee Browne]], [[Kathleen Chalfant]], [[Michael Douglas]], [[Faye Dunaway]], [[Sandy Duncan]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Aasif Mandvi]], [[Richard Gere]], [[Joel Grey]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Frank Langella]], [[Mary McDonnell]], [[Lauren Graham]], [[Zakes Mokae]], [[Howard Rollins]], [[John Spencer (actor)|John Spencer]], [[Ralph Waite]], [[Sam Waterston]], and [[Sigourney Weaver]].

==Awards==
*''Village Voice'' [[Obie Award]]s: Several dozen including a grant and citation for "uncompromising commitment to unconventional and daring plays"{{Quote without source|date=July 2018}} – 1982
*[[AUDELCO Awards]] for excellence in Black Theatre: ''Williams &amp; Walker'' by Vincent Smith, ''Ground People'' by Leslie Lee, ''Zora Neale Hurston'' by Laurence Holder, and ''Fly'' by Joseph Edward
*The New England Theatre Conference Special Award for pioneering in the aiding and encouragement of the craft of playwriting for writers in other literary fields
*The Margo Jones Award – 1966

==Literature to Life==
A new chapter for the American Place Theatre began with its first [[Literature to Life]] performance in 1994 of Toni Morrison's ''[[The Bluest Eye]]''. Literature to Life, the American Place Theatre's performance-based literacy program, presents professionally staged verbatim adaptations of significant American literary works. This educational program gives students a new form of access to literature by bringing to life the world of books with performances that create an atmosphere of discovery and spark the imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.americanplacetheatre.org/about| title=Literature to Life: About}} Retrieved on May 11, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature to Life has received multiple grants from the [[Carnegie Corporation]], an organization that has supported more than 550 New York City arts and social service institutions since its inception in 2002, and which was made possible through a donation by New York City [[mayor]] [[Michael Bloomberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/nyregion/06donate.html?ex=1278302400&amp;en=93a1beabd4ede5b8&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss| title=New York Times: City Groups Get Bloomberg Gift of $20 Million | work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Sam | last=Roberts | date=July 6, 2005 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Books that have been adapted for Literature to Life's theatrical performances include Ray Bradbury's ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', Tim O'Brien's ''[[The Things They Carried]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=June 16, 2010| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/nyregion/31bookwe.html?scp=1&amp;sq=%22literature%20to%20life%22&amp;st=cse|title= Asking the Whole Country to Embrace a War Story | work=The New York Times | first=Susan | last=Hodara | date=January 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s ''[[Black Boy]]'', [[Jonathan Safran Foer]]'s ''[[Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close]]'', [[Sue Monk Kidd]]'s ''[[The Secret Life of Bees (novel)|The Secret Life of Bees]]'', [[Khaled Hosseini]]'s ''[[The Kite Runner]]'', and [[Lois Lowry]]'s ''[[The Giver]]''.

Project 451, the funding initiative of Literature to Life, was starting during the 2008/2009 season to ensure that reading, writing, and the arts remain a primary component of the education of young American citizens. Spokespeople for Project 451 include [[Meryl Streep]], [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Sam Waterston]], and [[Jessica Lange]].

The titles for the 2010/2011 season were [[Junot Díaz]]' ''[[The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao]]'', adapted and directed by Elise Thoron, and [[Piri Thomas]]' ''[[Down These Mean Streets]]'' adapted and directed by [[Wynn Handman]]. Literature to Life's new adaptation for the 2009/2010 season was [[Greg Mortenson]]'s best-selling book ''[[Three Cups of Tea]]''.

Every year, the American Place Theatre hosts its annual Gala, the Literature to Life Awards. The 2011 Literature to Life Awards took place on May 23, 2011. They began with an adapted theatrical performance of ''Down These Mean Streets'' starring actor Jamil Mena and ''The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao'' starring [[Elvis Nolasco]] and honored [[Piri Thomas]] and Junot Díaz. The evening also included a performance written and performed by students from [[Newcomers High School]], a high school for students who have recently immigrated to the US, in [[Long Island City]].&lt;ref name="Kolodner"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/news-world-report-best-high-schools-survey-names-newcomers-high-tops-city-6-country-article-1.433275 | title=US News &amp; World Report's 'Best High Schools' survey names Newcomers High tops in city, #6 in country |work=[[New York Daily News]]| date=December 10, 2009 | accessdate=December 8, 2017 | author=Meredith Kolodner and Joe Kemp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Deijman''''' (alternative spelling '''Deyman''') is a 1656, fragmentary painting by [[Rembrandt]], now in [[Amsterdam Museum]]. It is a group portrait showing a brain dissection by Dr. Jan Deijman (1619{{en dash}}66). Much of the canvas was destroyed in a fire in 1723 and the painting was subsequently recut to its present dimensions, though a preparatory sketch shows the full group.

The painting shows Dr. Deijman performing a brain dissection on the cadaver of an executed criminal, the Flemish tailor Joris "Black Jack" Fonteijn (1633/34{{en dash}}56). Dr. Deijman's assistant, the surgeon Gijsbert Calkoen (1621{{en dash}}64), is seen on the left, holding the top of the dead man's skull.

The perspective of the corpse is depicted with exaggerated foreshortening to give the viewer a sense of standing in front of the dissection table, similar to the foreshortening in Mantegna's ''Lamentation of Christ'', which Rembrandt would have been familiar with through prints.

'''''The Cactaceae''''' is a monograph on plants of the cactus family written by the American botanists [[Nathaniel Lord Britton]] and [[Joseph Nelson Rose]] and published in multiple volumes between 1919 and 1923. It was landmark study that extensively reorganized cactus taxonomy and is still considered a cornerstone of the field.&lt;ref name=agpn/&gt; It was illustrated with drawings and color plates principally by the British botanical artist [[Mary Emily Eaton]] as well as with black-and-white photographs.

==History==
[[File:Britton Rose Cactaceae v1-plate34.jpg|thumb|Watercolor of several  ''Opuntia'' cactus species by Mary Emily Eaton for Britton and Rose's ''The Cactaceae'', 1919 (vol. 1, plate XXXIV).]]

Nathaniel Lord Britton was a Columbia University geology and biology professor who left the university in 1895 to become the founding director of the [[New York Botanical Garden]]. Much of his own field work was done in the Caribbean. Joseph Nelson Rose was an authority on several plant families, including parsley ([[Apiaceae]]) and cacti ([[Cactaceae]]). He had been a plant curator at the Smithsonian since 1896, and while working there he made several field trips to Mexico, collecting specimens for the Smithsonian and for Britton's newly founded New York Botanical Garden. Together, Britton and Rose published many articles on the stonecrop family ([[Crassulaceae]]) before embarking in 1904 on research leading towards ''The Cactaceae''. With the support of Douglas T. MacDougal, director of the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]]'s Desert Botanical Laboratory, the Carnegie Institution agreed to fund the project.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt; Rose took a leave of absence from the Smithsonian to pursue it, and both Rose and Britton were named Carnegie Institution Research Associates in 1912, when more focused work on the project began.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt; Between 1912 and 1916 Rose and Britton did extensive field work, collecting specimens and touring the botanical gardens and notable collections of Europe, the Caribbean, and North, Central, and South America.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt;

In this period, cactus taxonomy was in a disorganized state with only a few very large and heterogeneous genera.&lt;ref name=loph/&gt; Britton and Rose broke these old-style catch-all genera into smaller, more defined genera, ultimately classifying 1255 species under 124 genera.&lt;ref name=loph/&gt; It has been argued that with this first major overhaul of cactus genera, they ushered in an era of 'splitting' or liberalism in cactus taxonomy, in contrast to the conservative 'lumping' approach that characterized their predecessors.&lt;ref name=agpn/&gt;

Britton and Rose defined their genera by the characteristics of the cactus plants' vegetation, flowers, and fruit, as well as by their geographic distribution.&lt;ref name=loph/&gt; They drew on their own and others' field work, as well as on greenhouse studies and specimens in [[herbarium|herbaria]] to describe species included in their exhaustive study.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt; An important aspect of their work was their careful reexamination of existing type specimens, many of which turned out to have been incorrectly identified.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt;&lt;ref name=amre/&gt;

Britton and Rose published ''The Cactaceae'' in four volumes through the Carnegie Institution between 1919 and 1923. It "set new standards in cactus botany"&lt;ref name=loph/&gt; and has been called Britton's "magnum opus".&lt;ref name=nybg/&gt; Though it was considered definitive in its own day,&lt;ref name=amre/&gt; the taxonomy of Cactaceae has remained problematic, due in part to difficulties in preserving type specimens of cactus. Several taxonomic reorganizations have succeeded Britton and Rose's work, with the most recent major one dating to 1984. (See [[Cactus#Taxonomy and classification|Cactus]] entry for more details.) Despite this, the excellence of their work is reflected in the fact that some 50 of the 79 genera they authored are still considered phylogenetically sound, though some have been redefined.&lt;ref name=agpn/&gt;

A black-and-white reprint of the second (1937) edition of ''The Cactaceae'' was published by Dover Publications in 1963. In 2006, Daniel Schweich undertook a project to digitize the entire book, and all four volumes can now be downloaded in full color.

In 1911, the British illustrator [[Mary Emily Eaton]] moved to New York, where she was employed by the New York Botanical Garden for two decades. The great majority of color plates in the four volumes of  ''The Cactaceae''  are by Eaton, with a handful by other artists such as [[Deborah Griscom Passmore]], H.A. Wood, and Kako Morita.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt;&lt;ref name=hartwell/&gt; Eaton's compositions are striking and her watercolors are noted for their crispness and accuracy of botanical detail. 

The color plates are supplemented by black-and-white line drawings as well as by black-and-white photographs of cacti, ranging from long shots taken in the field to close-up details.&lt;ref name=cact/&gt; One contemporary reviewer called ''The Cactaceae'' “the most sumptuous botanical publication" since [[William Rickatson Dykes]]’ 1913 book ''The Genus Iris''.&lt;ref name=amre/&gt;

'''''The Orange Sky''''' ({{lang-uk|Помаранчеве Небо}}). This film was made in 2006, after the [[Orange Revolution]] which took place in [[Ukraine]].  It was directed by Oleksandr Kyryenko with the Cinema Production.

==Mini-Synopsis==
The movie tells of a love story of two greatly different young people. The heroine, Ivanna is a young girl with ambitiously nationalistic beliefs in the power of democracy.  She expresses her patriotism by voicing, often protesting the present regime of Ukraine in the favor of revolutionary ideals.  Mark, the protagonist, on the other hand is a privileged son of a government official whose life is filled with excitement from being able to get everything his heart desires. The two meet in the midst of a national crisis when a series of massive protests and political events were unfolding in Ukraine. Of course with the meeting, the two fall in love forever changing each other's paths. Mark is unwillingly becoming estranged from his comfortable life and seeks to obtain understanding of what drives Ivana and her friends to stand up to authority. Eventually two are united in one cause: fighting for a better future for their country. The movie uses a semi-reenactment of the actual events of the winter in Ukraine during the Orange Revolution. The protests, the rioting, the cold weather are all there.

==Cast==
*Lidia Obolenska as Ivanna
*Oleksandr Ihnatusha as Ivanna's father

==Criticism==
The “Orange Sky” movie seems to represent exactly that transition  of original cinematography into a less sophisticated form of movie productions such as presently known as “pop culture” and “show business”. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

'''''Wanchojang''''' ({{korean|hangul=완초장}}) is the traditional [[Korea]]n art of creating mats, baskets and boxes from woven [[Cyperaceae|sedge]] (''wancho'').&lt;ref name="Chaedan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hanʼguk Kukche Kyoryu Chaedan|title=Masters of traditional Korean handicrafts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zxk4AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=12 April 2013|year=2009|publisher=Korea Foundation|isbn=978-89-86090-32-1|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sedge has been a common material for household goods in Korea since the [[Silla|Silla period]] (57 BCE – 935 CE). Despite the availability of the plant, which grows well in the waterlogged soil of rice paddies, sedge products were highly prized and were used as decoration in royal palaces and given as tribute to other nations. A sedge basket known as a ''pyebaek dongguri'' was an important element of the traditional wedding rite, and royal sacrificial ceremonies in the [[Goryeo|Goryeo period]] employed sedge weaving as a religious sacrament.&lt;ref name=koreana&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Min Young|title=Yi Sang-jae Handicrafter of Sedge Masterpieces|url=http://koreana.kf.or.kr/view.asp?article_id=7606|work=Koreana|publisher=Korea Federation|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The process of creating sedge products starts with the farming of the raw material. Sedge is planted in April and harvested only a few months later in the summer. The cut stalks are boiled, dried, soaked, and then dried again in a process that, after several repetitions, bleaches them to a shiny white colour.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt;&lt;ref name=antique&gt;{{cite web|title=The Artistic Beauty of Grass Weaving|url=http://www.antiquealive.com/masters/m10/master10_view3.html|work=Antique Masters|publisher=Antique Alive|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some strands are dyed to enable coloured highlights and designs in the finished work.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt;

Two principal methods for weaving the sedge exist: one involving the use of tools or machines, the other performed entirely by hand. These are sometimes referred to as "close" and "sparse" weaving.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt;&lt;ref name=antique/&gt;&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=Handicrafts:Wanchojang|url=http://www.ichcap.org/en/archives/unescoView2.jsp?ich_name=ICH_LIST3_ENG&amp;idx=&amp;listLIDX=113&amp;searchtext=|work=ICH Archives|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machine weaving is predominantly used for making mats, whilst boxes, bowls and baskets require hand weaving. A basic frame (''no'') is created first, comprising interwoven sedge strands; the ''samori'', or vertical sections, are then weaved into this. At this stage, images, patterns and characters are incorporated into the design, in a process called ''tteumjil''.&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt; The process of creation is lengthy, taking up to two weeks for the construction of a hand-made ''sajuham'' ("three-tiered box").&lt;ref name=antique/&gt;

==Yi Sang-jae==
The current master of ''wanchojang'' is Yi Sang-jae from [[Ganghwado]], an area that has long been a site of sedge cultivation and weaving. Born in 1943, he has been working in sedge for over fifty years, and has had his works exhibited in Japan and the UK.&lt;ref name=antique/&gt; Yi, along with the art of ''wanchojang'' itself, was designated in 1996 as an [[Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea|Important Intangible Cultural Asset]].&lt;ref name=koreana/&gt;&lt;ref name=unesco/&gt;
