'''American Independent Writers (AIW)''' was an American [[trade organization]] for professional writers. It existed from 1975 until about 2011, when, due to dwindling membership and financial problems, it went out of business. 

It was formed as the '''Washington Independent Writers (WIW)''' in 1975 by a group of freelance writers in the Washington DC area to address concerns over finding health insurance, job searching, and to provide social opportunities to help writers overcome isolation. Its first meetings were held in the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]].&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.amerindywriters.org/about-aiw/history-of-aiw/ "History of AIW"] American Independent Writers official site. Retrieved 2011-11-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meeting, in April 1975, was attended by 200 people.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; By 1987, WIW was the largest regional writers' group in the country.&lt;ref name=Vesey&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wvxDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SrAMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4050,2570728&amp;dq=washington-independent-writers+largest&amp;hl=en "Writers Say Tax Changes Ruining Incomes"], by David Vesey, [[UPI]], ''[[The Durant Daily Democrat]]'', August 5, 1987.

Originally WIW provided services including "a monthly newsletter, Job Bank, social activities, directory of members, legal services program, health insurance access, grievance procedures, medical insurance, and a continuing round of workshops and seminars."&lt;ref name=History/&gt; By the 1980s, these had expanded to include political activism,&lt;ref name=Vesey/&gt; and legal support and fundraising, most famously for founding member [[Kitty Kelley]] from 1983 to 1984, when she was sued by [[Frank Sinatra]] in an attempt to stop her publication of his unauthorized biography, ''His Way''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xuVLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gosDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3125,1062469&amp;dq=washington-independent-writers&amp;hl=en "Writer Gets Notice of Sinatra Suit"], [[Associated Press]], ''[[The Free Lance–Star]]'', November 7, 1983, page 9.

Online at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The group changed its name to American Independent Writers (AIW) on July 1, 2008, to open up more opportunities for grants and donations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asaecenter.org/Resources/ANowDetail.cfm?ItemNumber=44071 "How a Small, Regional Association Went National in 18 Months"], by Cecilia Sepp, ''[[Associations Now]]'', September 2009, Feature.

'''Artel of Artists''' ({{Lang-ru|«Арте́ль худо́жников»}}) was a [[cooperative]] association (''[[artel]]'') and a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] of democratically-minded artists headed by [[Ivan Kramskoi]]. It was established in 1863 after some of its future organisers had been expelled from the [[Imperial Academy of Arts|St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg Academy of Arts]] because of the "revolt of fourteen".  In rebellion against the Academy's annual competition, the students refused to paint an exam picture on the given topic.

A number of members of the Artel later became ''[[Peredvizhniki|Peredvizhniks]]''.

[[File:Brooklyn Museum 82.154.2 Housepost One of Pair.jpg|thumbnail|Yoruba Veranda Posts, Brooklyn Museum]]

'''Ase''' or '''ashe''' (from the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] ''às̩e̩'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseire.com/meaning.php|title=What Is Ase Ire?|publisher=Ase Ire.com |accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[African philosophy#West Africa|West African philosophical concept]] through which the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of [[Nigeria]] conceive the power to make things happen and produce change. It is given by [[Olodumare]] to everything — gods, [[Ancestor|ancestors]], spirits, humans, animals, plants, rocks, rivers, and voiced words such as songs, prayers, praises, curses, or even everyday conversation. Existence, according to Yoruba thought, is dependent upon it.&lt;ref name=Drewal&gt;{{cite book|last=Drewal|first=H. J., and J. Pemberton III with Rowland Abiodun|title=Yoruba: Nine Centuries of African Art and Thought|year=1989|publisher=The Center for African Art|location=New York City|editor=Allen Wardwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its sacred characteristics, ''ase'' also has important social ramifications, reflected in its translation as "power, authority, command." A person who, through training, experience, and initiation, learns how to use the essential life force of things to willfully effect change is called an ''alaase''.

Rituals to invoke divine forces reflect this same concern for the autonomous ''ase'' of particular entities. The recognition of the uniqueness and autonomy of the ''ase'' of persons and gods is what structures society and its relationship with the other-world.&lt;ref name=Drewal /&gt;

==Ase and Yoruba Art==
The concept of ''ase'' influences how many of the Yoruba arts are composed. In the visual arts, a design may be segmented or seriate - a "discontinuous aggregate in which the units of the whole are discrete and share equal value with the other units."&lt;ref name="Drewal 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drewal|first=M. T., and H. J. Drewal|title=Composing Time and Space in Yoruba Art|journal=Word and Image: A Journal of Verbal/Visual Enquiry|year=1987|volume=3|issue=3|pages=225–251|doi=10.1080/02666286.1987.10435383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such elements can be seen in [[Ifá]] trays and bowls, veranda posts, carved doors, and [[Traditional African masks#Ancestors masks (masks of the dead)|ancestral masks]].

Regarding composition in Yoruba art as a reflection of the concept of ''ase'', Drewal writes:

{{quote|text=Units often have no prescribed order and are interchangeable. Attention to the discrete units of the whole produces a form which is multifocal, with shifts in perspective and proportion... Such compositions (whether representational or not) mirror a world order of structurally different yet autonomous elements. It is a formal means of organizing diverse powers, not only to acknowledge their autonomy but, more importantly, to evoke, invoke, and activate diverse forces, to marshal and bring them in to the phenomenal world. The significance of segmented composition in Yoruba art can be appreciated if one understands that art and ritual are integral to each other.&lt;ref name=Drewal /&gt;}}

==The head as the site of ase==
The head, or ''ori'', is vested with great importance in [[Yoruba art]] and thought. When portrayed in sculpture, the size of the head is often represented as four or five times its normal size in relation to the body in order to convey that it is the site of a person's ''ase'' as well as his or her essential nature, or ''iwa''.&lt;ref name=Drewal /&gt; The Yoruba distinguish between the exterior (''ode'') and inner (''inu'') head. ''Ode'' is the physical appearance of a person, which may either mask or reveal one's inner (''inu'') aspects. Inner qualities, such as patience and self-control, should dominate outer ones.

The head also links the person with the other-world. The ''[[Amorites|imori]]'' ceremony (which translates to ''knowing-the-head'') is the first rite that is performed after a Yoruba child is born. During ''imori'', a diviner determines whether the child comes from his or her mother's or father's lineages or from a particular ''orisa''. If the latter is the case, then the child will undergo an orisa initiation during adulthood, during which the person's ''ori inu'' becomes the spiritual vessel for that orisa's ''ase''. To prepare for these ceremonies, the person's head is shaved, bathed and anointed.&lt;ref name=Drewal /&gt;

Charles Evans (1850–1935), supported by myriad people, wrote the first book on the history of printing and books, from Colonial times to the Federal Era, entitled ''American Bibliography''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krummel|first=D.W.|title=Early American Imprint Bibliography and Its Stories: an introductory course in Bibliographical Civics|journal=Libraries &amp; Culture|year=2005|volume=3|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 50 years after Evans, Ralph Shaw (1902–72) and Richard Shoemaker (1907–70) began to catalogue where Evan left off.
This began a regional catalogue that evolved into a national catalogue called the National Union catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krummel|first=D.W.|title=Early American Imprint Bibliography and Its Stories: an introductory course in bibliographical civics|journal=Libraries &amp; Culture|date=Summer 2005|volume=40|issue=3|pages=239–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7771">[[File:Braak Bog Figures.JPG|thumb|Braak Bog Figures in the Schleswig-Holstein state archaeology museum at Gottorf Castle.]]The '''Braak Bog Figures''' are two wooden carvings discovered in 1947 in a peat bog in [[Braak]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Northern Germany]]. Part of a larger tradition of [[Anthropomorphic wooden cult figurines of Central and Northern Europe|similar figures]] spanning the period from the [[Neolithic]] to the [[Middle Ages]], they are [[Anthropomorphism|human-like]] in appearance and have been [[carbon dating|carbon dated]] to the 2nd or 3rd century BCE; the Schleswig-Holstein state archaeology museum puts them as far back as 400BCE. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain their function and what they may represent, from depictions of deities to ancestor worship.

==Appearance and dating==
Carved from carefully selected naturally forked oak branches,&lt;ref name="ALDHOUSE GREEN-59&amp;ndash;60"&gt;Aldhouse Green (2004:59&amp;ndash;60).&lt;/ref&gt; the figures are [[Anthropomorphism|human-like]] and are {{convert|275|cm|in}} (male) and {{convert|230|cm|in}} (female) in height.&lt;ref name="SIERKSMA-168"&gt;Sierksma (1960:168).&lt;/ref&gt; They have sockets for arms (the appendages are missing) and pebbles may have been used for their eyes.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON-1988-17"&gt;Davidson (1988:17).&lt;/ref&gt; The figures exhibit marked sexual dimorphism: in addition to the difference in height, the female has her hair in a topknot and the male has short hair with [[Fringe (hair)|bangs]],&lt;ref name="ALDHOUSE GREEN-59&amp;ndash;60"/&gt; and the sexual organs are emphasized.&lt;ref name="TODD-108"&gt;Todd (2009:108).&lt;/ref&gt; The breasts of the female figure are "set in separately" and the male figure's genital had been "struck off".&lt;ref name="SIERKSMA-168"/&gt; The noses are also differentiated, but both have open mouths as if screaming.&lt;ref name="ALDHOUSE GREEN-59&amp;ndash;60"/&gt; Fires had repeatedly been built near the site of the find.&lt;ref name="ALDHOUSE GREEN-61"&gt;Aldhouse Green (2004:61).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Braak figures are [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon dated]] to the 3rd to 2nd century BCE,&lt;ref name="ALDHOUSE GREEN-59&amp;ndash;60"/&gt; but have also been dated to the early 4th century BCE.&lt;ref name=exhibit&gt;Hansen (2010:34).&lt;/ref&gt; They are among several [[Anthropomorphic wooden cult figurines of Central and Northern Europe|anthropomorphic wooden figures]] of varying form unearthed from the [[Neolithic]] and into the [[Middle Ages]], in areas of Northern Europe ranging from Schleswig-Holstein in Germany to [[Norrland]] in Sweden.&lt;ref name=Oldeberg&gt;Oldeberg (1957).&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these figures date to the [[Iron Age]] and the [[Roman period]].&lt;ref name="TODD-AND-DAVIDSON-1988"&gt;See Davidson (1988:15-19) &amp; Todd (2009:108).&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, the Braak Bog Figures are the largest found in Germany,&lt;ref name=exhibit/&gt; and [[Malcolm Todd]] calls them the "most imposing".&lt;ref name="TODD-108"/&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[Fokke Sierksma]] commented in 1960 that as the figures were found together in a peat bog, near a pile of stones containing fragments of pottery and evidence of fire, these find circumstances "together with the considerable dimension of the figures, and the combination of a male and a female figure, make it virtually certain that they represent deities of Northern Germanic tribes. These located the residence of their gods in peat bogs, and regarded the sacred union of a fertility god and a fertility goddess as prerequisite for the continued propagation of life in all its forms".&lt;ref name="SIERKSMA-168"/&gt;

[[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] (1975) comments that these figures may represent a "Lord and Lady" of the [[Vanir]], a group of [[Norse gods]], and that "another memory of [these wooden figures] may survive in the tradition of the creation of [[Ask and Embla]], the man and woman who founded the human race, created by the gods from trees on the seashore".&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON-1975-89"&gt;Davidson (1975:88—89).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to regard them as part of ancestor worship.&lt;ref&gt;Capelle (1995:13).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freudenberg (2007:85).&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm Todd (2009) comments that the Braak Bog Figures and other similar bog figures have a "significance [that is] difficult to determine but [they] should be related to the supra-mundane and perhaps specifically to the presiding deities of fertility and war".&lt;ref name="TODD-108"/&gt;

==Current location and controversy==
The Braak Bog Figures are in the Schleswig-Holstein state archaeology museum at [[Gottorf Castle]]. The post-war [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] there, [[Karl Schlabow]], has been accused of over-restoring archaeological exhibits, including accentuating the sexual characteristics of the Braak figures.&lt;ref&gt;Brock (2007:[http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/windeby-geheimnis-der-moorleichen-gelueftet-a-466195-2.html 2]).

[[File:Monomacho's crown - circa 1042 Budapest - detail3.jpg|thumb|Byzantine enamel from [[Monomachus crown]] - early 11th century]]
The craft of [[cloisonné]] [[overglaze decoration|enameling]] is a metal and glass-working tradition practiced in the [[Byzantine Empire]] from the 6th to the 12th century. The Byzantines perfected an intricate form of vitreous enameling, allowing the illustration of small, detailed, iconographic portraits.

== Overview ==
	The development of the Byzantine enamel art occurred between the 6th and 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enamelwork|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/enamelwork|website=Britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] perfected a form of [[Vitreous enamel|enameling]] called [[cloisonné]], where gold strips are [[Soldering|soldered]] to a metal base plate making the outline of an image. The recessed spaces between the gold filigreed wire are then filled with a colored glass paste, or flux, that fills up the negative space in the design with whatever color chosen. Byzantine enamels usually depict a person of interest, often a member of the imperial family or a Christian icon. Enamels, because they are created from expensive materials such as gold, are often very small. Occasionally they are made into medallions that act as decorative jewelry or are set in ecclesiastical designs such as book covers, liturgical equipment like the [[chalice]] and [[paten]], or in some examples, royal crowns. Collections of small enamels may be set together to make a larger, narrative display, such as in the [[Pala d'Oro]] altarpiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Marian|title=An Introduction to Medieval Enamels|date=1983|publisher=Stemmer House Publishers, Inc.|location=Owings Mills, Maryland|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the examples of Byzantine enamel known today have been repurposed into a new setting, making dating particularly difficult where no inscriptions or identifiable persons are visible. The [[Crusaders|Latin Crusaders]], who sacked [[Constantinople]] in 1204, took many examples of Byzantine enamel with them back West. The destruction of Constantinople meant that the production of enamel artwork went into downfall in the 13th century. It is possible that many examples left in the city were melted down and repurposed by the [[Ottoman Empire]], who cared little about the religious significance of the art and could reuse the gold but not the glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wessel|first1=Klaus|title=Byzantine Enamels|date=1967|publisher=New York Graphic Society Ltd.|location=Greenwich, CT|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The art of [[vitreous enamel]]ing is an ancient practice with origins that are hard to pinpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel p.11&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few places that Byzantine craftsmen could have picked up the technique. Enameling is thought to have existed in an early form in [[ancient Egypt]], where examples of gold ornaments containing glass paste separated by strips of gold have been found in tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are questions about whether the Egyptians were using actual enameling techniques; it is possible that instead they were casting glass stones which were then enclosed, set into metal frames, and then sanded to a finish, similarly to how precious stones are set.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;  In first century BCE Nubia, a method appears of soldering gold strips to a metal base, most often gold, and then filling in the sectioned off recesses with glass flux. This method, called cloisonné, later became the preferred style of enameling in the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Darbringung Christi KGM 27-19.jpg|thumb|Darbringung Christi enamel]]

The enamel workshops within the Byzantine Empire likely perfected their techniques through their connections with [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] examples.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks were already experts in enameling, soldering a filagree onto a flat base and later adding a paste of glass, or a liquid flux, to the base piece.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The entire work was then fired, melting the glass paste into the frame to create the finished work. Occasionally, the ancient Greek craftsman would apply the glass flux to the base with the aid of a brush.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]], who were experienced in glass production already, would carve a recess into the base plate and then pour glass flux into each enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The metal peeking through between the recessed glass would create the outline of the image. This technique is called [[champlevé]], and is considerably easier than the cloisonné form of enameling practiced by the Greeks and Byzantines.

== Byzantine enamel tradition ==
The Byzantines were the first craftsmen to begin illustrating detailed miniature scenes in enamel. A few examples of early Byzantine enamel frames missing the glass flux have been found, and it has been hypothesized that they were used as educational tools in workshops. Some incomplete enamel base plates show indentations marking the line to which the gold wire would be attached, indicating how designs were outlined before soldering and enameling began. Because they were not carving recesses into a base plate and then filling the hole with glass flux, Byzantine workers could also use gold wire to create patterns that would not separate recesses from one another, resulting in a style that appears more like a drawn line.

Most of the Byzantine enamels known today are from the 9th to 12th centuries. The period of [[Iconoclasm]] from 726-787 CE meant that most examples predating the 8th century were destroyed because of their iconographic nature, though there are a few examples thought to have been made earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest examples of Byzantine enamel work is a medallion created in either the late 5th or early 6th century and features a bust portrait of [[Licinia Eudoxia|Empress Eudoxia]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The period after Iconoclasm saw an upswing in the production of iconic portraits, to which the intricate form of cloisonné developed by the Byzantines lends itself easily. Most enamel works known today have been housed in western Europe since the beginning of the 13th century. Any examples of enamel work still inside Constantinople immediately prior to its destruction were lost or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Enamels are considered a "[[Minor arts|Minor Art]]" because of their small size, which likely led to their increase in use as decoration for small, portable containers holding holy [[relics]]. In this tradition, many enameled pieces found their way to the western empire by way of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] and gifts from the imperial family in Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The high value and relatively small size of enamel pieces meant that they were made for an aristocratic audience, most likely commissioned by the imperial family, often as gifts for other royals or for the churches they patronized. For example, there is evidence that Emperor [[Justinian II]] (565-578) sent enamels to [[Radegund|Queen Radegund]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible transmission for Byzantine enamels to the west came in the form of imperial marriages. In 927, the German [[Emperor Otto II]] married the niece of the Byzantine [[John I Tzimisces|Emperor John I Tzimisces]], princess [[Theophanu]], and she supposedly introduced imperial goldsmiths and enamelers to the German church.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Many famous examples of Byzantine enamel are ''staurothekes'', relics containing fragments of the [[True Cross]], which were greatly prized in both the east and the west, therefore more survive still in modern collections. It is likely that a ''staurotheke'' was one of the first gifts sent from the East to the West. There is some evidence that the Crusaders carried the reliquaries in front of their military campaigns as Byzantine emperors were known to have presented them.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Reliquary True Cross c800 Byzantine.jpg|thumb|Fieschi Morgan Staurotheke]]

== Notable examples ==

=== Fieschi-Morgan Staurotheke ===
[[File:Monomacho's crown - circa 1042 Budapest.JPG|thumb|Monomachus Crown - early 11th century]]
The [[Fieschi Morgan Staurotheke|Fieschi-Morgan Staurotheke]] is an example of Byzantine enameling dating to the early 9th century, though some suggest as early of a creation date as 700. It was quite possibly made in Constantinople, though there are debates around its origins, some suggesting it was made in Syria based on the inconsistencies in the Greek lettering.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel p.43&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently housed in [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Supposedly, the Fiesch-Morgan Staurotheke belonged to [[Pope Innocent IV]] and was brought to the west by the [[Fieschi family|Fieschi]] family during the Crusades.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel p.42&lt;/ref&gt; The lid of the box features Christ on the crucifix, a style not usually seen in Byzantine art until the end of the 6th century, remaining uncommon throughout the period. The work is not particularly refined, signaling the creator was perhaps not familiar with cloisonné work.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Holy Crown of Hungary ===
[[File:Archangel Michael on the Holy Crown of Hungary.jpg|thumb|Enamel of the [[Archangel Michael]] from the Holy Crown of Hungary - 11th century]]
The [[Holy Crown of Hungary]], also known as [[Saint Stephen's Crown|St. Stephen's Crown]], has been used as the coronation crown of Hungary since the year 1000, when the Hungarian royals introduced Christianity to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Return of the Holy Crown of St. Stephen|url=http://hungary.usembassy.gov/holy_crown.html|access-date=2016-03-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305103608/http://hungary.usembassy.gov/holy_crown.html#|archive-date=2016-03-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains mostly Byzantine enamelwork originating from Constantinople, though it isn't proven they were crafted originally for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p.111&lt;/ref&gt; The enamels are mounted around the base, with several plaques attached at the top. One enamel shows Christ, seated on the imperial throne and giving blessing.  Another enamel, positioned at the back of the crown, illustrates a bust portrait of [[Michael VII Ducas|Emperor Michael VII Ducas]] (1071-1078), next to another plaque of his son [[Constantine Doukas|Constantine]]. The Hungarian [[Géza I of Hungary|King Géza I]] (1074-1077) is also featured, though he is not wearing a nimbus like Michael VII Ducas or Constantine, which indicates his status as lower than that of the Byzantine Emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beresford Hope Cross ===
The [[Beresford Hope Cross]] is a pectoral cross intended for use as a reliquary.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; On one side Christ is depicted at the Crucifixion, while the other shows Mary praying between busts of John the Baptist, Perter, Andrew, and Paul. The dating is contentious, but most agree it was made in the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; The style is similar to the Fieschi-Morgan Staurotheke; the cloisonné of both is unrefined and stylistically sloppy compared to other examples. The inconsistencies in the Greek lettering on the cross mean that it is possible the piece was not made in the Byzantine Empire, but in southern Italy, where the [[Lombards]] had active metal workshops of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems with dating and origins ==
Many examples of Byzantine enamel are hard to date because of a lack of inscription or identifiable individual. In these cases, guesses must be made to the date of the object in question through a comparison with similar objects with known dates. This can be done by examining material sources and by comparing styles. For example, objects with green glass composed of similar material might be grouped within a similar date range. Origins of Byzantine enamel work are often even harder to pinpoint, as nearly everything made has been housed in the West since the early 13th century. One way of guessing the origins of a piece is by examining the quality of the Greek lettering; the more accurate the Greek, the more likely the work came directly from the Byzantine Empire.

== Byzantine influence on Germanic metalwork ==
The [[Migration Period]] of [[early medieval]] art sees a concurrent form of metalwork influenced by the [[Goths]]' migration through the eastern Roman Empire into the west, accumulating techniques and materials from Byzantine and [[Mediterranean]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nees|first1=Lawrence|title=Early Medieval Art|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, instead of using traditional Byzantine enamel techniques, they often employed a [[chip-carving]] technique, where stones such as [[garnets]] are cut to fit into a wire frame. This has the appearance of cloisonné, but is more similar to the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] Egyptian style. The appearance of cloisonné jewelry from Germanic workshops in the mid-5th century is a complete break with the culture’s traditions, signaling that they likely picked up the technique from the east, where the Byzantine Empire was gaining a foothold as the center of the [[Late Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deppert-Lippitz|first1=Barbara|title=Late Roman and Early Byzantine Jewelry in the Mid 5th Century|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that Late-Roman workshops in Constantinople produced semi-manufactured enamel parts intended for assembly in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arrhenius|first=Birgit|authorlink=Birgit Arrhenius|title=Garnet Jewelry of the Fifth and Sixth Centuries|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ceremonial Stone Landscapes''' is the term used by USET, United Southern and Eastern Tribes, Inc.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204008/http://www.usetinc.org/index.cfm], a non-profit, intertribal organization of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]], for certain stone work sites in eastern [[North America]]. Elements often found at these sites include [[dry stone wall]]s, rock piles (sometimes referred to as [[cairn]]s), stone chambers, unusually-shaped boulders, split boulders with stones inserted in the split, and boulders propped up off the ground with smaller rocks. While neither the age of these sites nor the idea of their creation by indigenous peoples has been accepted generally, interest in the sites is increasing. This interest is generated in part by USET's Resolution #2007:037 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204022/http://www.usetinc.org/images/images_res/2007037.pdf], entitled Sacred Ceremonial Stone Landscapes Found in the Ancestral Territories of United Southern and Eastern Tribes, Inc. Member Tribes.

Sections of the USET resolution describing these sites read as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"within the ancestral territories of the USET Tribes there exist sacred ceremonial stone landscapes and their stone structures which are of particular cultural value to certain member Tribes;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"for thousands of years before the immigration of Europeans, the medicine people of the USET Tribal ancestors used these sacred landscapes to sustain the people's reliance on Mother Earth and the spirit energies of balance and harmony"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"whether these stone structures are massive or small structures, stacked, stone rows, or effigies, these prayers in stone are often mistaken by archaeologists and State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPOs) as the efforts of farmers clearing stones for agricultural or wall building purposes"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The resolution goes on to request that the federal government work to understand and preserve the stone landscapes.

'''''Delirium''''' is a 2013 [[Ukrainian cinema|Ukrainian film]] produced and directed by [[Ihor Podolchak]], premiered in Director’s Week Competition in [[Fantasporto]] (Portugal, 2013),&lt;ref&gt;[https://uk.imdb.com/list/7MM0eMKIv7Q?sort=listorian%3Aasc&amp;view=detail&amp;start=1 Fantasporto 2013 Director's Week Competition], [https://uk.imdb.com/ IMDb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424144107/http://uk.imdb.com/ |date=2013-04-24 }}. Retrieved March 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; awarded with the "First Prize"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baghdadfilmfest.com Baghdad International Film Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Baghdad]] International Film Festival (2013).

''Delirium'' is the second Podolchak feature film. The screenplay is based on the novel ''Inductor'' by Ukrainian writer Dmytro Belyansky.

==Plot==
A family asks a young psychiatrist to be their guest for a while and help look after their father who’s developed a suicidal fixation for ropes and knots among other things. It is also entirely possible that the mental health of the guest that is the real cause for concern.

==Cast==

* Lesya Voynevych as Mother
* Petro Rybka as Father, Professor
* Olha Horbach as Daughter
* Olha Bakus as Maid
* Vasyl Kostenko as Son, Son in Law
* Ivan Kostenko as Priest

==Production==
Work on the script had begun in the spring of 2008 and was completed on the eve of filming. The director's development and preparatory period were financially supported by the [[Huub Bals|Hubert Balls Foundation]] (The Netherlands). In search of locations for filming, the film group carried out a long expedition on the Carpathians and Transcarpathians of Ukraine. The first stage of filming took place from August 1 to September 15, 2008, in the suburbs of [[Lviv]] - [[Briukhovychi]] and [[Horodok, Lviv Oblast|Horodok]], the second stage was held in [[Kyiv]] in late 2009 - early 2010. In total. The shooting was conducted on a digital [[Red Digital Cinema|Red One]] camera. Almost the whole film, with the exception of the first and last scene, was shot with the help of the [[Tilt–shift photography|Tilt- Shift]] lenses, which made it possible to create a specific image with uneven focus distribution along the frame, plane and various geometric distortions of the frame content. In the scene, which was filmed in Gorodok church, an Oscar-winning ''Garmoshka'' crane &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmotechnic.kz/equipment/#7 Filmotechnik Garmoshka Crane] Retrieved July 14, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and a gyrostabilized panoramic head ''Flight Head''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmotechnic.kz/equipment/#2 Filmotechnik Flight Head]Retrieved July 14, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; of the renowned&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.kinokolo.ua/up/news.php?id=2608 Filmotechnik Awards]. Retrieved June 29, 2013{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian company ''[http://filmotechnic.com/ Filmotechnik]'' were used.

Editing, color correction, and sound design were made on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] hardware and Apple software: [[Final Cut Studio]], and [[Logic Pro]]. Visual effects were made in [[Adobe After Effects]]. The sounds from the set were not used. The voices of three male characters - the Father, the Guest, the Son - was performed by the Kiev actor Vitaly Linetsky. The sound design of the film was performed by well-known Ukrainian musician and TV showman - Miroslav Kuvaldin. The final edition of the sound was made by Igor Podolchak and Igor Durych in 2011.

==Music==
The score was written and performed by [[Alexander Schetinsky]]. Initially, the director and composer planned to use the traditional musical genre [[Dies irae]], which is part of the Catholic Mass. Were written six completed instrumental parts, named according to the sections of the Latin mass: [[Dies irae]], [[Quantus tremor]], [[Mors stupebit]], [[Ingemisco]], [[Tuba mirum]], [[Lacrimosa]].

The composer limited himself to the means of the symphony orchestra and did not use any text or vocals. The music does not contain direct illustrations, and, in particular, thanks to avant-garde style techniques, paradoxically combined with names, appealing to the [[surrealism]] principles, which fully corresponded to the aesthetics of the film. However, during the work the authors decided to use only two musical parts - Mors stupebit at the beginning of the film (initial [[titles]]) and Dies irae on the final credits&lt;ref&gt;[http://society.lb.ua/culture/2013/ 02/27 / 190761_mirovaya_premera_ukrainskogo_filma.html World premiere of ''DELIRIUM], [http://lb.ua lb.ua]. Retraived on March 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;.

During the unfolding of the film, music does not sound at all. Thanks to this, the initial and final musical fragments acquired additional dramatic significance: an introduction to the "[[problematic]]" of the film (the effect of tuning on the corresponding aesthetic "wave") and a semantic generalization.

== Interpretations ==
[[File:DELIRIUM Still 1.jpg|thumb|left|230px|&lt;small&gt;Still&lt;/small&gt;]]
Like in his first film ''[[Las Meninas (film)|Las Meninas]]'', ''Deliriu'' appeals to the intricate family sagas, which appear in the novels by [[Witold Gombrowicz]], [[Milorad Pavic]], and [[Bruno Schulz]].
Unlike the sagas [[Luchino Visconti]] ("[[The Damned (1969 film)|The Damned (1969 film)]]) or [[Ingmar Bergman]] (''[[Fanny and Alexander]]''), Podol'chak avoids [[Narrative|narrative]] but everything happens outside the space-time [[Continuum hypothesis|continuum]] with a focus on psychological states. His characters are arbitrary, which is emphasized by archetypal names: Father, Mother, Daughter.

Developing the themes set in his first film ''Las Meninas'', Podolchak in ''Delirium'' somewhat modifies the "family" structure - introduces into the hermetic nightmare the "other" character - the person from the side. But this "stranger" (the main character is the Psychiatrist, a kind of heir to the narrator from''[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]'' by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]) shows himself not as an alien body. His invasion does not cause any changes in the "family organism". The family absorbs the "alien", turning him into a full participant of a strange game, the exit of which does not exist&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Підгороа-Ґвяздовский, Я.

From the point of view of cinematic genres, more accurately subgenres, ''Delirium'' can be attributed to the so-called "stories about the house with no way out" or "stories of houses with ghosts." From the films of the first category, the closest is ''[[Singapore Sling (1990 film)|Singapore Sling]]'' and ''[[See You in Hell, My Darling]]'' by [[Nikos Nikolaidis]]. From the films of the second category, you can, for comparison, recall ''[[The House on Telegraph Hill]]'' by [[Robert Wise]] and ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]'' by [[Alejandro Amenábar]]. But unlike the films by Wise and Amenabar, in Podolchak's ''Delirium'' the spectator encounters the concept of "erroneous suspense" when the director seems to create an atmosphere of anxious anticipation, but these premonitions of something terrible are being destroyed by the characters' inadequate reaction on them.

[[Suspense]], performed by Podolchak, is self-destructing. It has no point of view "from the outside", there is no coordinate of "normality", relating to which the viewer is able to oppose herself/himself to screen suspense. The viewer becomes this obscurity. Thus Podolchak provokes a feeling of acute [[claustrophobia]]&lt;ref name="Купінська, А."&gt;Купінська, А. [http://life.pravda.com.ua/culture/2013/07/20/134289/ ''Сьомий день Одеського фестивалю: перші підсумки, непрості фільми Кіри Муратової та Ігоря Подольчака'']. [http://life.pravda.com.ua life.pravda.com.ua], 20.07.2013 Retrieved September 20, 2013{{ref-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; - there is no way out from Podolchak's "home-world". The spectator, like the characters, does not know is there anything beyond the boundaries of the place where she/he is at the moment. Since "this moment" has the ability to loop, then the flight "from here" becomes simply impossible.

'''''Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood''''' (or simply '''''Don't Be a Menace''''') is a 1996 American [[crime film|crime]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[parody film]] directed by [[Paris Barclay]] in his feature film directorial debut, and produced by [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]], and also written by Wayans brothers [[Shawn Wayans|Shawn]] and [[Marlon Wayans]], who also both starred in the lead roles. The film was released in the United States on January 12, 1996.

Similar to ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]'', the film spoofs a number of [[African Americans|African-American]], [[coming-of-age]], [[hood film]]s such as ''[[Juice (film)|Juice]]'', ''[[Jungle Fever (film)|Jungle Fever]]'', ''[[South Central (film)|South Central]]'', ''[[Higher Learning]]'', ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]'', ''[[New Jack City]]'', ''[[Dead Presidents]]'', ''[[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]]'', and most prominently ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'', ''[[Menace II Society]]'' and ''[[Above the Rim]]''. The film's title borrows phrases from some of those films, and some of the actors who starred in those movies appear in the film, in some cases appearing in similar roles or scenes as the films being parodied.

== Plot ==
Ashtray, Tray for short, is sent to the inner city to live with his father. Tray gets an education about life on the streets from his psychotic, gun-toting cousin Loc Dog, Preach, and Crazy Legs. At a picnic Tray falls for the infamous Dashiki much to the distaste of ex-convict Toothpick. While Ashtray and Loc Dog head to buy some snacks, Toothpick and his posse confront Ashtray and hold him at gunpoint, until Loc Dog threatens them with a missle mounted in the back of his van, stamped with the letters “USSR” Loc Dog claims it is in fact a nuclear device. Toothpick and his gang then flee the scene.

Loc Dog and Ashtray get harassed in a Korean store by the owners and Loc Dog shoots at the owners when a remark is made about his mother. The two are then confronted by 'The Man' (a mysterious white, government figure) who kills the Koreans and tosses them his gun to frame them and leaves.

Meanwhile, Ashtray and Loc Dog's Grandma ride to church and another elderly woman disses her, resulting in a breakdancing contest that Grandma wins.

Ashtray visits Dashiki where they engage in [[sexual intercourse]] and Dashiki immediately claims he has impregnated her. Feeling like he's not responsible enough to be the father, Dashiki kicks him out. Someone from Toothpick's posse threatens Ashtray, Loc Dog, Preach, and Crazy Legs. Loc Dog knocks him out as he and Preach proceed to stomp him, flattening him (literally). The quartet decides to get protection from their friend Old School. This tactic fails as Toothpick performs another drive-by and Crazy Legs is injured. With Crazy Legs hospitalized, himself and Loc Dog being arrested, and the Korean store shooting, Tray decides to confront Dashiki and be the father. Dashiki agrees to give Tray another try and they decide to leave the hood as planned. Ashtray and Loc Dog talk about Ashtray's departure as Toothpick and his posse prepare for another drive-by and he and Loc Dog clash as Ashtray flees and trips and is knocked out as Loc and Toothpick continue to shoot at each other. They are saved when Grandma pops out of the dumpster and shoots Toothpick's car as Toothpick is flung out and he lands on a cop car. Preach and Dashiki find Ashtray hurt and he regains consciousness and kisses Dashiki. A woman finds Toothpick (who turns out to be his mother) and beats him with his shoe for stealing from her in the past afterwards toothpick and his gang are arrested.

Afterwards, everyone goes their separate ways: Ashtray and Dashiki marry and enjoy their lives, Loc Dog becomes a host and introduces himself with extreme profanity, Preach and his crush settle down and perform sexual intercourse, Crazy Legs becomes a dancer as he had dreamed of, and Grandma is, as Ashtray puts it, "still Grandma" (showing her smoking [[marijuana]]).

==Cast==
* [[Shawn Wayans]] as Ashtray, the [[everyman]], trying to make his way through a confusing world, is sent by his mother to live in the [[ghetto]] where his father might teach him how to become a man. Based on Tre Styles from ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' and Caine Lawson from ''[[Menace II Society]]''.
* [[Vivica A. Fox]] as Ashtray's mother, whose one-scene, one-line cameo at the beginning ends with her son asking: "So will I see you again?" and her reply, "Sorry baby. You know there ain't no positive black females in these movies." Based on Reva Devereaux-Styles from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* Lahmard Tate as Ashtray's father, Ashtray's temperamental role model who dispenses sage advice to his son. According to Ashtray, he is only "a couple years older than I am." Although many references were made to Ashtray possibly being older than he was, such as Ashtray attending a party that his father is not old enough to attend. Based on Furious Styles from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Loc Dog: Ashtray's cousin and gangsta/drug dealer/criminal. He drives a [[United States Postal Service|USPS]] delivery truck which is loaded in the back with ballistics, including a nuclear weapon. Based on O-Dog from ''Menace II Society'' and Doughboy from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* [[Helen Martin]] as Grandma, Ashtray and Loc Dog's grandmother; a marijuana-smoking, foul-mouthed, church-going woman.
* [[Chris Spencer (actor)|Chris Spencer]] as Preach, Ashtray's friend and former gang member turned 'politically conscious' activist, resembling a [[Nation of Islam]] member, but is now just "confused"; he has a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] for white girls. Based on Sharif from ''Menace II Society'' and Ali from ''South Central''.
* [[Suli McCullough]] as Crazy Legs: Ashtray's friend; was paralyzed in a [[Drive-by shooting|drive-by]]. Has a dream to be a professional dancer. Based on Chris from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* Tracey Cherelle Jones as Dashiki, the object of Ashtray's affections. A "hood mother" with seven kids by seven different men. Dashiki's address is [[69 (sex position)|6969]] [[sexual intercourse|Penetration]] Avenue. Based on Ronnie from ''Menace II Society'' and Justice from ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]''.
* Isaiah Barnes as Doo Rag: Dashiki's oldest son and the only one of her kids who has more than one line of dialogue. He pulls a gun on Ashtray after losing a video game. When he admits he learned about guns from "cartoons and 'hood movies'", Ashtray passionately declares that he and Doo Rag are an endangered species—not because their lives are in danger, but because "rappers are taking all the good acting jobs!". The kid rolls his eyes as Ashtray lectures him about the values of education. Based on Anthony from ''Menace II Society''
* Darrell Heath as Toothpick, Dashiki's ex-boyfriend, who was just released from prison and still acts like he's incarcerated. He swears he will kill Ashtray for romancing Dashiki. Based on Ferris from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* [[Antonio Fargas]] as Old School
* [[Bernie Mac]] as Officer Self Hatred, a cop who harasses Ashtray and Loc Dog. As he has Ashtray pinned against his squad car, he goes on and on about how much he hates black people and anything black. Based on the bully cop from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* [[Terri J. Vaughn]] as Keisha: A possessed woman that Loc Dog met at the late night party and takes to the cargo hold of his truck. While proceeding to have sex with her, she morphs into a demonic version of herself and proceeds to force Loc Dog to have sex with her. It is unknown what happened after this. Based on Abby the 1974 blaxploitation horror film about a woman who is possessed by an African sex spirit.
* Benjamin N. Everitt as The Man, a pale white man with red hair and glasses, who systematically robs a [[convenience store]] while the Korean owners are keeping a close, racist eye on Ashtray and Loc Dog and completely ignore his crimes. When Loc Dog is firing his gun at the owners and not hitting them, The Man fires his gun once and hits a hanging light that falls on the owners and kills them. He then tosses his gun to an unwitting Ashtray and Loc Dog, who mistakenly catch it as he scratches their names off his list of black men whom he's framed for crimes and peels off a single glove (a reference to the [[O.J. Simpson]] case).
* Fozeyl Fuzz Atcha as Dave the Crackhead, a drug user apparently going through withdrawal who offers to perform [[fellatio]] in return for spare change or directions to a person's house. Based on the nameless "Basehead" character from ''Menace II Society''.
* [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]] as The Mailman; he appears various times throughout the film shouting "Message!" whenever a moral lesson is expressed without subtlety in dialogue. At the end of the film, when Loc Dog gives a rambling speech to Ashtray, the Mailman appears, and says, "What the fuck is he talking about?"
*[[LaWanda Page]] as Old School's mom

'''Ethiopian manuscripts''' are known to have reached Europe as early as the fifteenth century, perhaps even earlier, through Egypt, Ethiopian pilgrims to the Holy Land and through members of the [[Ethiopian]] monastery of [[St Stephen of the Abyssinians]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="D. Nosnitsin 2012"&gt;D. Nosnitsin, "Ethiopian Manuscripts and Ethiopian manuscript studies. A brief overview and evaluation," ''Gazette du livre médiéval'', 58 (2012), 2–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, travellers, missionaries, military personnel and scholars contributed to the development of collections outside Ethiopia. In Europe, the three biggest collections of Ethiopian manuscripts are in Rome (Biblioteca Apostolica Vatican), in Paris (Bibliothèque nationale de France) and in London (British Library). These three organisations together hold about 2,700 manuscripts. Oriental collections of nearly all significant European libraries also have Ethiopian material, with some still pursuing a policy of acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;V. Six, “Neuzugang von äthiopischen Handschriften an  die Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, Preußischer Kulturbesitz,” ''Aethiopica'' 10 (2007), 177-83.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Monasteries and modern institutions in Ethiopia have, meanwhile, maintained extensive collections and in some cases are still centres of manuscript production. [[Parchment]] (''berānnā'') was used for Ethiopian manuscripts from the time of the Four Gospels books of Abbā Garimā.&lt;ref&gt;Bausi, Alessandro, and Eugenia Sokolinski, ''Comparative Oriental Manuscript Studies: An Introduction'' ([Hamburg]: COMSt, 2015): 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Islamic manuscripts, paper only came into general use twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Bausi, Alessandro, and Eugenia Sokolinski, ''Comparative Oriental Manuscript Studies: An Introduction'' ([Hamburg]: COMSt, 2015): 155.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are eighty eight languages in Ethiopia according to [[Ethnologue]],&lt;ref name="Ethnet"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=ET ''Ethnologue'' page on Ethiopian languages]&lt;/ref&gt; but not all support manuscript cultures. The majority of manuscripts are in [[Ge'ez]], the ancient liturgical language of Ethiopia.

'''Catalogues''' of individual collections were written in the nineteenth century, with a key work for the disposition of Ethiopian MSS more widely prepared in 1995 and published by Robert Beylot and Maxime Rodinson.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Beylot and Maxime Rodinson, ''Répertoire des Bibliothéques et des Catalogues de Manuscrits Éthiopiens'' (DNRS Editions; Paris: Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Éditions, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time, an online inventory has been developed that documents items labelled as “Ethiopian manuscripts’’ in libraries all over the world. This "[http://www.menestrel.fr/spip.php?rubrique694&amp;lang=en&amp;art=en Inventory of Libraries and Catalogues of Ethiopian Manuscripts]" was created in 2008 and is maintained since then by A. Wion, C. Bosc-Tiessé and M.-L. Derat from CNRS (Paris). The list of institutions below is a partial selection of the most prominent and best known collections, giving special attention to the individual researchers involving in forming the collections and those scholars who wrote the catalogues.

==Accademia dei Lincei, Rome==
The [[Accademia dei Lincei]] in [[Rome]] holds the collection of 138 manuscripts formed by [[Carlo Conti Rossini]]. The catalogue prepared by [[Stefan Strelcyn]] includes 30 further manuscripts in the Fonds Caetani.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Strelcyn, ''Catalogue des manuscrits éthiopiens de l'Accademia nazionale dei Lincei: fonds Conti Rossini et fonds Caetani 209, 375, 376, 377, 378'' (Roma: Accademia nazionale dei Lincei, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest manuscripts in the collections date to the fifteenth century with some having a provenance of [[Debre Damo]].

==Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris==
[[File:Saint Ildefonse BnF Ethiopien 60 fol. 7v.jpg|thumb|Miracle de Notre Dame and Saint Ildefonso, [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Ethiopien 60 fol. 7v]]
The collections in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], held primarily in the Département des Manuscrits, have been subject to several cataloguing campaigns. In 1877 a catalogue was published by [[Hermann Zotenberg]] and gave an account of the 170 manuscripts then in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;H. Zotenberg, ''Catalogue des manuscrits éthiopiens (gheez et amharique) de la Bibliothèque nationale'' (Paris, Imprimerie nationale, 1877). Available online at https://archive.org/details/manuscritsorient00bibl&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopic holdings were subsequently enlarged by the three collections, those of d'Abbadie, Casimir Mondon-Vidailhet,&lt;ref&gt;For him see: http://data.bnf.fr/15411049/casimir_mondon-vidailhet/ Accessed Sēptembre 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marcel Griaule]] which increased the number at BnF to more than 970 manuscripts. Zotenberg's work was accordingly followed by a catalogue of the Mondon-Vidailhet collection prepared by M. Chaine.&lt;ref&gt;M. Chaine, ''Catalogue des manuscrits éthiopiens de la collection Mondon-Vidailhet'' (Paris, Ernest Leroux, 1913). Available online at https://archive.org/stream/catalogueethiopia00bibluoft#page/n7/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; The Griaule collection was published by [[Stefan Strelcyn]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Strelcyn, ''Catalogue des manuscrits éthiopiens (Collection Griaule). Ethiopien 301-304, 675-687 Tome IV'' (Paris: Impr. nationale, 1954).&lt;/ref&gt; The BnF has the largest single collection of magico-medical scrolls in France, with over 160 specimens in the Griaule collection.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvain Grébaut and S. Strelcyn, ''Catalogue des manuscrits éthiopiens de la Collection Griaule'' (Paris: Institut d'Ethnologie, 1938).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bodleian Library, Oxford== 
The early collections in the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]] came from [[James Bruce]], and consisted of 25 Ethiopic manuscripts purchased by the library in 1843. The collection soon grew to 33 manuscripts and these were catalogued and published in 1848 by [[August Dillmann]].&lt;ref&gt;August Dillmann, ''Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum Bibliothecae Bodleianae Oxoniensis. Pars 7 Pars 7'' (Oxonii: E Typographeo Academico, 1848).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-nineteenth century the collection has expanded to 130 items. A notable addition in 2002 was an illustrated seventeenth-century manuscript of a Marian text, ''Arganona Weddase'' (‘Harp of Praise’) (MS. Aeth.e.28).&lt;ref&gt;Retrieved September 2016 https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/weston/finding-resources/guides/hebrew&lt;/ref&gt; The uncatalogued manuscripts were revisited in 2007 by Steve Delamarter and Damaqa Berhāna Tafarā.&lt;ref name="Delamarter Tafarā 2007"&gt;Steve Delamarter and Damaqa Berhāna Tafarā, ''A Catalogue of Previously Uncatalogued Ethiopic Manuscripts in England: Twenty-Three Manuscripts in the Bodleian, Cambridge University and John Rylands University Libraries and in a Private Collection,'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press on behalf of the University of Manchester, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==British Library, London==
[[File:Annunciation to Zechariah British Library Add. MS 59874 Ethiopian Bible.jpg|thumb|Folio from an illustrated Bible, Annunciation to Zechariah, [[British Library]] Add. MS 59874.]]
The founding Ethiopic collections in the [[British Library]]—74 manuscripts—came from the [[Church Mission Society]] and the materials that had been assembled by [[Karl Wilhelm Isenberg]] and [[Johann Ludwig Krapf]], missionaries and linguists who travelled to the country between 1839 and 1842.&lt;ref&gt;British Library, retrieved August, 2016: http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelplang/ethiopic/ethiopiancoll/. See further: Isenberg and Krapf, [[Journals of Isenberg and Krapf]] (London, 1843), visible online at https://archive.org/stream/journalsofrevmes00isen/journalsofrevmes00isen_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; However, some of the collection has an earlier provenance, for example, ''Extracts from the Chronicle of Axum'', written on paper in about 1810 with the book plate of [[George Annesley, 2nd Earl of Mountnorris]].&lt;ref&gt;William Wright, ''Catalogue of the Ethiopic Manuscripts in the British Museum Acquired Since the Year 1847'' (London: British Museum, 1877), 319. MS Add 19,341. The book was purchased at the Arley Castle sale of 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847 the Trustees of the [[British Museum]] published a catalogue of the Ethiopian manuscripts that were then under their care. This catalogue was prepared by [[August Dillmann]] and included 88 items.&lt;ref&gt;William Wright, ''Catalogue of the Ethiopic Manuscripts in the British Museum Acquired Since the Year 1847'' (London: British Museum, 1877), iii. August Dillmann, ''Catalogus codicum manuscriptorum Orientalium qui in Museo Britannico asservantur. Pars tertia, Pars tetra'' (Londini: Impensis Curatorum Musei Britannici, 1847).&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Library collections grew in 1868 when 349 manuscripts came after the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]] against emperor [[Tewodros II]].&lt;ref&gt;Rita Pankhurst, "The library of Emperor Tewodros II at Mäqdäla (Magdala)," ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'' 36, no. 1 (1973): 15-42. https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0041977X00097974  Stéphane Ancel, Denis Nosnitsin, "On the History of the Library of Mäqdäla: New Findings," ''Aethiopica'' 17 (2014): 90-95, dec. 2014. ISSN 2194-4024. Available at: &lt;http://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/aethiopica/article/view/859&gt;. Date accessed: 30 Aug. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; A catalogue of the enlarged collection was prepared by [[William Wright (orientalist)]] and published in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;William Wright, ''Catalogue of the Ethiopic Manuscripts in the British Museum Acquired Since the Year 1847'' (London: British Museum, 1877), iii.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine decades later, [[Stefan Strelcyn]] reviewed the manuscripts that had come to the British Library after 1877 and published a catalogue of them.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Strelcyn, Catalogue of Ethiopian Manuscripts in the British Library Acquired Since the Year 1877 (London: British Museum Publications, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; The catalogue lists 108 items (some with multiple parts) and covers the general range of [[Ethiopian literature]] from Biblical texts to magical and divinatory writings.

The transfer of the [[India Office]] collection to the British Library in 1982 brought 6 further manuscripts to the collection, first acquired in 1842 by the India Museum in [[East India House]]. 

A further collection of 39 manuscripts came to the British Library from Roger Wenman Cowley (1940-1988). Cowley spent 15 years in Ethiopia as an Anglican missionary and teacher, during which time he assembled a collection of Biblical commentaries in Amharic.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsten Stoffregen-Pedersen, ''Traditional Ethiopian exegesis of the Book of Psalms'' (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1995): 2.&lt;/ref&gt; His MSS consist of copies on paper commissioned by Cowley and executed during the years 1967-77 (except for numbers 19-61, 32, 37, 40-42 and 44 which are copies made at different times in the twentieth century). Cowley used this material in his book ''Ethiopian Biblical Interpretation'', published in 1988. &lt;ref&gt;Roger W. Cowley, ''Ethiopian Biblical Interpretation: A Study in Exegetical Tradition and Hermeneutics'', University of Cambridge Oriental Publications, Published for the Faculty of Oriental Studies, 38, (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1988), review by [[Edward Ullendorf]], ''Journal of  Semitic Studies'' 15, no. 1 (1990): 181-183. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/jss/XXXV.1.181&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal''''' (2001) is a book by investigative journalist [[Eric Schlosser]] that examines the local and global influence of the United States fast food industry.

First serialized by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/fast-food-nation-part-one-the-true-cost-of-americas-diet-19980903|title=Fast-Food Nation Part One: The True Cost of America's Diet|last=Scholsser|first=Eric|publisher=Rolling Stone|year=1998|isbn=|location=Rolling Stone|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999, the book has drawn comparisons to [[Upton Sinclair]]'s classic [[muckraking]] novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' (1906).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Jungle|last=Sinclair|first=Upton|publisher=Doubleday, Jabber, &amp; Company|year=1906|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was adapted into a 2006 [[Fast Food Nation (film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Richard Linklater]].

== About the Author ==
An investigative journalist with a degree in history from Princeton, [[Eric Schlosser]] explores subjects ignored by the mainstream media and tries to give a voice to people at the margins of society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.barclayagency.com/site/speaker/eric-schlosser|title=Eric Schlosser {{!}} Steven Barclay Agency|website=www.barclayagency.com|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/mar/14/food/fo-37251|title=The Hamburger Critic (and His Own Critics)|last=SAGON|first=CANDY|date=March 14, 2001|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed the harvest with migrant farm workers in California, spent time with meatpacking workers in Texas and Colorado, told the stories of marijuana growers and pornographers and the victims of violent crime, gone on duty with the New York Police Department Bomb Squad, and visited prisons throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His aim is to shed light on worlds that are too often hidden.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He has contributed to many journals including ''The New Yorker'' and ''The New York Times''. ''Fast Food Nation'' was his first book.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==
''Rolling Stone'' asked Schlosser to write an article looking at America through fast food in 1997 after reading his article on migrants in ''Atlantic Monthly''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/523/schlosser-food-finances.html|title=Q &amp; A: Eric Schlosser, author of 'Fast Food Nation,' on the state of the American food system|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then spent nearly three years researching the fast-food industry, from the slaughterhouses and packing plants that turn out the burgers to the minimum-wage workers who cook them to the television commercials that entice children to eat them with the lure of cheap toys and colorful playgrounds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The experience enraged and appalled him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Summary==
The book is divided into two sections: "The American Way" and "Meat and Potatoes". "The American Way"  takes a historical view of the fast food business by analyzing its beginnings within post-World War II America while "Meat and Potatoes" examines the specific mechanisms of the fast-food industry within a modern context as well as its influence.

=== "The American Way" ===
The first section of ''Fast Food Nation'' opens with a discussion of [[Carl N. Karcher]] and the [[Richard and Maurice McDonald|McDonald brothers]], examining their roles as pioneers of the fast-food industry in southern California. This discussion is followed by an examination of [[Ray Kroc]] and [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Ray Kroc#Purchasing McDonald's|complicated relationship]] before ending with the consideration of the intricate, profitable methods of advertising to children. Next, Schlosser visits [[Colorado Springs, CO]] and investigates the life and working conditions of the typical fast-food industry employee, learning how fast-food restaurants pay minimum wage to a higher proportion of their employees than any other American industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/11/17/where-near-minimum-wage-workers-work-and-how-much-they-make/|title=Where near-minimum-wage workers work, and how much they make|date=November 17, 2014|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Meat and Potatoes" ===
The second section of the text begins with a discussion of the chemical components that make the food taste so good. Schlosser follows this with a discussion of the life of a typical rancher, considering the difficulties presented to the agricultural world in a new economy. Schlosser's critique is particularly strong when analyzing the meatpacking industry, which he tags as the most dangerous job in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/01/how-to-make-the-countrys-most-dangerous-job-safer/302395/|title=How to Make the Country's Most Dangerous Job Safer|last=Schlosser|first=Eric|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the meat produced by slaughterhouses has become increasingly more hazardous since the centralization of the industry due to the way cattle are raised, slaughtered, and processed, providing an ideal setting for [[E coli]] to spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180312150520.htm|title=Water troughs are key to E. coli contamination in cattle|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, working conditions continue to grow worse. In the final chapter, Schlosser considers how fast food has matured as an American cultural export following the Cold War and how the collapse of Soviet Communism allowed the mass spread of American goods and services, especially fast food. As a result, the rest of the world is catching up with America's rising obesity rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/gho/ncd/risk_factors/overweight/en/|title=Overweight and obesity|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/|title=Obesity and overweight|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Afterword"===
In the 2012 edition, Schlosser published a revised edition that included an afterword. In the afterword, he looks back at the relevance and criticism of the first edition and how it inspired other works as well as how the fast food industry has evolved in the ten years following the book, including its effects on policy and childhood obesity rates. He concluded that, given the swift, decisive and effective action that took place as a result of this interest and intervention, many of the problems documented in the book are solvable, given enough political will. The afterword can also be read in an article penned by Schlosser at ''The Daily Beast''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/03/12/still-a-fast-food-nation-eric-schlosser-reflects-on-10-years-later|title=Still a Fast Food Nation: Eric Schlosser Reflects on 10 Years Later|last=Schlosser|first=Eric|date=March 12, 2012|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Young reader version==
An adaptation of ''Fast Food Nation'' for younger readers titled ''[[Chew on This]]'' was published in May 2006 by [[Houghton Mifflin]]. It is co-authored by journalist Charles Wilson

==Reception==

Rob Walker, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', remarks that "Schlosser is a serious and diligent reporter"" and that "''Fast Food Nation'' isn't an airy deconstruction but an avalanche of facts and observations as he examines the fast-food process from meat to marketing."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Rob|title=No Accounting for Mouthfeel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/01/21/reviews/010121.21walkert.html|accessdate=February 22, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=January 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker however does raise concerns over the data which Schlosser bases his claims from.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, Schlosser cites that hundreds have died from E. coli infections as a result of eating fast food, however, as Walker points out, "[Schlosser] extrapolated his figures from an annual total in a report on food-related illness, which itself relied on a good deal of extrapolation. Moreover, that report doesn't address fast food specifically (and in fact Schlosser builds his numbers from figures including E. coli cases that are not even food-borne), which is relevant because fast-food outlets are hardly the only places where processed meat is sold."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''The Atlantic's'' Julia Livshin believes "Schlosser's book is not just a compendium of kitchen horror stories. In clean, sober prose packed with facts, he strips away the carefully crafted feel-good veneer of fast food and shows how the industry's astounding success has been achieved, and is sustained, at an equally astounding cost—to the nation's health, environment, economy, and culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/interviews/ba2000-12-14.htm|title=Interview - 2000.12.14|website=www.theatlantic.com|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"While cataloguing assorted evils with the tenacity and sharp eye of the best investigative journalist, [Schlosser] uncovers a cynical, dismissive attitude to food safety in the fast food industry and widespread circumvention of the government's efforts at regulation enacted after Upton Sinclair's similarly scathing novel exposed the meat-packing industry 100 years ago. By systematically dismantling the industry's various aspects, Schlosser establishes a seminal argument for true wrongs at the core of modern America."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-395-97789-7|title=Nonfiction Book Review: Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal by Eric Schlosser, Author  Houghton Mifflin Co $26 (288p) ISBN 978-0-395-97789-7|work=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Industry response ===

Terrie Dort, president of the National Council of Chain Restaurants, the trade association representing many of the country's major fast-food chains, released this statement about Schlosser and his book: "It is unfortunate that Mr. Schlosser's book, 'Fast Food Nation,' categorizes the entire fast-food industry in such a negative light. The restaurant companies that comprise the industry provide employment to hundreds of thousands of workers across the country and offer consumers a wide variety in menu options and prices. We take exception to the characterization in this book."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

"[Schlosser] is trying to paint a picture of 1906 in order to scare people. Unfortunately, fear and graphic stories sell," said Janet Riley, vice president of public affairs for the American Meat Institute, the trade association that represents most of the nation's meat packers and processors. "There is no doubt in our minds that our food today is safer than it's ever been because there is so much more science and technology in our plants to ensure that safety. Our families eat from the same food supply that everyone else does. Of course we want safe food."

Lester Crawford, director of the Center for Food and Nutrition Policy at Georgetown University and a former meat inspector for the USDA, says he has read only "snippets" of Schlosser's book but calls it "well-intentioned criticism."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:HelenD'OylyCarte.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Helen Carte]] 

'''Helen Carte Boulter''' (born '''Susan Helen Couper Black'''; 12 May 1852 – 5 May 1913), also known as '''Helen Lenoir''', was the second wife of impresario and hotelier [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]. She is best known for her stewardship of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] and [[Savoy Hotel]] from the end of the 19th century and into the early 20th century.

Born in [[Wigtown]], Scotland, she attended the [[University of London]] from 1871–74 and pursued brief teaching and acting careers. In 1875, she met Richard D'Oyly Carte and soon became his assistant and business manager. She helped produce all of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and other [[Savoy Opera]]s, beginning with ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' in 1877 and for the rest of her life, and helped Carte with all of his business interests. One of her principal assignments was to superintend arrangements for American productions and tours of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas. Her grasp of detail and her diplomatic skills surpassed even those of her husband. 

She married Richard D'Oyly Carte in 1888. During the 1890s, with her husband's health declining, Helen assumed greater and greater responsibility for the businesses, taking full control upon his death in 1901. She remarried in 1902 but continued to own the opera company and run most of the Carte business interests until her death, when they passed to her stepson, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]].  Although the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's operations decreased after Richard's death, Helen staged successful repertory seasons in London from 1906 to 1908, establishing that the Gilbert and Sullivan operas could continue to be revived profitably.  

By the time of her death in 1913, the opera company had become a repertory touring company, and [[W. S. Gilbert]] had died. Helen hired [[J. M. Gordon]] to preserve the company's unique style. In her will, she left the [[Savoy Theatre]], the [[Savoy Hotel]] and the opera company to Rupert, the last of which operated continuously until 1982.

==Life and career==
[[File:HelenCarte1885.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Painting of Helen Carte by [[Walter Richard Sickert]], c. 1885: ''The Acting Manager'']]

===Early years===
'''Susan Helen Couper Black''' (or '''Cowper Black''' in some sources)&lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Wigtown]], Scotland, to George Couper Black (1820–c. 1874), [[procurator fiscal]] and banker, and his wife, Ellen, née Barham (1823–after 1877 from Penzance), the second of four siblings. One of her brothers, [[John McConnell Black]], later became a well-known botanist. Her grandfather, Robert Couper, M.D., was a Scottish physician and poet.&lt;ref&gt;Seeley, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  

She attended the [[University of London]] from 1871–74 and was a gifted student, passing the examinations for Special Certificates in mathematics and in logic and moral philosophy (the university did not award degrees to women until 1878).  She also spoke several languages.  She registered at the university as '''Helen Susan Black'''.  After her studies, she taught mathematics and had a brief acting career, during which she changed her name to '''Helen Lenoir''' ("Black", in French).&lt;ref&gt;Seeley, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared at the Gaiety Theatre in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, in ''The Great Divorce Case''. While a member of the Theatre Royal, in [[Dublin]], Ireland in September 1875, Helen met Richard D'Oyly Carte. He was there to manage the first tour of ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', and Helen became fascinated by his vision for establishing a company to promote English [[comic opera]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; She gave up her next engagement to join his theatrical organisation.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Stedman, Jane W. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59169, "Carte, Helen (1852–1913)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/59169}}; accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, Helen's mother, then a widow, relocated with Helen's sister and two brothers to Australia. Helen had just become secretary to Richard D'Oyly Carte and remained in London to help with production of ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' at the [[Opera Comique]].

===The woman behind the man===
From the time that she was hired as Carte's secretary, Helen was intensely involved in his business affairs and had a grasp of detail and organisational and diplomacy skills that surpassed even Carte's.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 111–12&lt;/ref&gt; She became the business manager of the company and was also responsible for the [[Savoy Hotel]], into which she introduced the new hydraulic passenger lifts.  One of Helen's early tasks was to produce the British copyright performance of ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' in [[Paignton]].  She made fifteen visits to America to promote Carte's interests, superintending arrangements for American productions and tours of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas.  She also assisted in arranging American lecture tours for [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Matthew Arnold]] and others.  Helen, more than anyone else, was able to smooth out the differences between [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]], in the 1880s, to ensure that the two produced more operas together.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Arthur.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32311, "Carte, Richard D'Oyly (1844–1901)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/32311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also tactfully and sympathetically dealt with the personal and professional problems of the actors in the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] casts.  The editor of ''The Era'' wrote in her obituary, "She never took advantage of anybody; but I never heard of her letting anybody take advantage of her."&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; 

[[File:Helen Carte Parasol.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Helen Carte, c. 1885, from ''The Sketch'', 1901]]
In 1886, Carte raised Helen's salary to £1,000 a year plus a 10% commission on the net profits of all business at his theatres.  According to historian Jane Stedman, "When she demurred, he wrote, 'You know very well, and so do all those who know anything about my affairs, that I could not have done the business at all, at any rate on nothing like the same scale, without you'".&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Carte's first wife had died in 1885, and Helen married Richard on 12 April 1888 in the [[Savoy Chapel]], with Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]] acting as Carte's best man.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Andrew.  ''Gilbert and Sullivan's London'' (1988; 2000), Faber &amp; Faber; {{ISBN|0-571-20016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The couple's London home included the first private elevator. [[James McNeill Whistler]], a client of Carte's agency and friend of the Cartes, made an etching of Helen in 1887 or 1888, "Miss Lenoir", and later helped to decorate the Cartes' home. Although some sources refer to Mrs. Carte as "Helen D'Oyly Carte", this is incorrect, as D'Oyly was a given name, not a surname. Her married name was '''Helen Carte'''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Throughout the 1890s, Richard's health was declining, and Helen assumed more and more of the responsibilities for the opera company and other family businesses. In his 1922 memoir, [[Henry Lytton]] described Helen Carte as follows:
:"She was a born business woman with an outstanding gift for organisation.  No financial statement was too intricate for her, and no contract too abstruse. Once, when I had to put one of her letters to me before my legal adviser... he declared firmly 'this letter must have been written by a solicitor.' He would not admit that any woman could draw up a document so cleverly guarded with qualifications.  Mrs. Carte, besides her natural business talent, had fine artistic taste and was a sound judge, too, of the capabilities of those who came to the theatre in search of engagements".&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html Lytton, Henry.  ''Secrets of a Savoyard'' (1922), chapter 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Carte hired his son [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]] as an assistant. Rupert's older brother, Lucas (1872–1907), a barrister, was not involved in the family businesses and died of tuberculosis at the age of 34.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary of Lucas D'Oyly Carte, ''The Times'', 22 January 1907, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; With no new [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] shows written after 1896, the [[Savoy Theatre]] put on a number of [[Savoy operas|other shows]] for comparatively short runs, including several of Sullivan's less successful operas.  Young Rupert assisted Helen and [[W. S. Gilbert]] with the first revival of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' at the Savoy in May 1897.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Post]]'', 7 January 1948&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, the theatre finally had a new success in Sullivan and [[Basil Hood]]'s ''[[The Rose of Persia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wearing, p. 844; and Gordon-Powell, Robin. Notes to programme for Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Festival Concert, 16 September 2006, London&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Carte's death===
[[File:BarringtonHelen.jpg|left|thumb|Helen with [[Rutland Barrington]], c. 1908]]
Richard died in 1901 leaving the theatre, opera company and hotel to Helen, who assumed full control of the family businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; She leased the [[Savoy Theatre]] to [[William Greet]] in 1901.  She oversaw his management of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]'s revival at the Savoy of ''[[Iolanthe]]'', and several new [[comic opera]]s including ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' (1901; Sullivan and [[Edward German]], with a libretto by [[Basil Hood]]), ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' (1902) and ''[[A Princess of Kensington]]'' (1903; both by German and Hood).&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

The last of these ran for four months in early 1903 and then toured.  When ''A Princess'' closed at the Savoy, Greet terminated his lease,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Penny Illustrated Paper and Illustrated Times]]'', 11 July 1903&lt;/ref&gt; and Helen leased the theatre to other managements until 8 December 1906. She had married [[Stanley Boulter]], a barrister, in 1902, but she continued to use the surname Carte in her business dealings. Boulter assisted her in the Savoy businesses. She was a founder member of the Society of West End Theatre Managers, along with [[Frank Curzon]], [[George Edwardes]], [[Arthur Bourchier]] and sixteen others.&lt;ref&gt;"The Society of West-End Theatre Managers", ''The Times'', 24 April 1908, pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her stepson Rupert took over his late father's role as Chairman of the [[Savoy Hotel]] in 1903, which Helen continued to own. The years between 1901 and 1906 saw a decline in the fortunes of the opera company.  The number of D'Oyly Carte repertory companies touring the provinces gradually declined until there was only one left, visiting often small centres of population.  After the company visited South Africa in 1905, more than half a year elapsed with no professional productions of G&amp;S in the British Isles.  During this period, Helen and Rupert focused their attention on the hotel side of the family interests, which were very profitable.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In late 1906, Helen re-acquired the performing rights to the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas from Gilbert (she already had those of Sullivan) and staged a repertory season at the Savoy Theatre, reviving the opera company and leasing the Savoy to herself. She persuaded the recently knighted Gilbert, now 71, to stage direct the productions in repertory, and once again she had to exercise the greatest tact, as Gilbert sometimes had difficulty accepting that he was no longer an equal partner and was taking no financial risk. Gilbert was angry that he had not been consulted regarding casting of the productions.&lt;ref name=Bridget&gt;Carte, Bridget D'Oyly. Foreword to Mander, Raymond and Joe Mitchenson, ''A Picture History of Gilbert and Sullivan'', Vista Books, London, 1962.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The season, and the following one, were tremendous successes, revitalising the company.  Contemporary accounts describe her taking three curtain calls with Gilbert on the opening night of the 1906 revival of ''The Yeomen of the Guard''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;  

[[File:DOCplanter.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Planter in Embankment gardens behind the [[Savoy Hotel]]]]
After the repertory seasons in 1906–08 the company did not perform in London again until 1919, only touring throughout Britain during that time. Carte wrote in 1911 that her health made it impossible for her to produce any more revivals at the Savoy.&lt;ref name=Bridget/&gt; In March 1909, [[Charles H. Workman]] assumed management of the Savoy Theatre from the now frail Helen Carte Boulter. She continued to manage the rest of the family businesses with the assistance of Rupert. In 1911, the company hired [[J. M. Gordon]], who had been a member of the company under Gilbert's direction, as stage manager. Carte was so generous that [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] granted to her the Order of the [[League of Mercy]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

After another illness lasting several months, Helen died of a cerebral haemorrhage complicated by acute bronchitis in 1913, a week before her 61st birthday.  A private funeral was held at [[Golders Green]] crematorium.  In her will, she left the Savoy Theatre, the opera company and the Savoy Hotel to Rupert, bequests of £5,000 to each of her two brothers and smaller bequests to a number of friends and colleagues.  She left the considerable [[residuary estate]] to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 May 1913, p. 11, reporting on "Probated Will of Helen Boulter"&lt;/ref&gt; The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to operate continuously until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Skow, John.

'''''Hiawatha''''' and '''''Minnehaha''''' are 1868 sculptures by [[Edmonia Lewis]]. They are in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] on view in gallery 759.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/687670|title=Edmonia Lewis {{!}} Hiawatha {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/687677|title=Edmonia Lewis {{!}} Minnehaha {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Early history and creation==
[[African Americans|African-American]], [[Haitian diaspora|Haitian]] and [[Ojibwe|Chippewa]] (Ojibwa) artist, Lewis, developed her [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style of marble sculpture while working in [[Rome]]. Lewis was an admirer of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s poetry, and in 1869 Longfellow visited her studio where he posed for one of her portraits which was shortly afterward acquired by Harvard University.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antiquesandfineart.com/articles/article.cfm?request=191|title=Hiawatha in Rome: Edmonia Lewis and Figures from Longfellow by user from Antiques &amp; Fine Art magazine|website=antiquesandfineart.com|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and interpretation==
[[File:Hiawatha MET DP371840.jpg|thumb|left|Hiawatha]]
Often working in themes that intersected her identity, Lewis focused a series of marble sculptures based on Longfellow’s much-referenced and best-selling poem “[[The Song of Hiawatha]]” (1855) about the Ojibwa warrior, [[Hiawatha]]'s tragic story with his lover from a rival tribe, [[Minnehaha]] (Dakota).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-LhwwTdCkiYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=song+of+hiawatha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxtq-PwoHUAhWBSCYKHYGVB8sQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=song%20of%20hiawatha&amp;f=false|title=The Song of Hiawatha|last=Longfellow|first=Henry Wadsworth|date=1857|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three busts of Hiawatha in existence and four of the Minnehaha busts. 

In addition to paying tribute to her heritage, Lewis also took agency by utilizing concepts of the [[Noble savage|Noble Savage]] in these works, idealizing and fantasizing the form and dress of the two fictional characters. Unlike other images of this theme and time, Lewis subversively focused not on their naked flesh, which historically attracted male collectors, but on decorating their bodies in clothing, which was intended to appeal to the women viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SByfh6JC7JkC&amp;pg=RA2-PA5&amp;lpg=RA2-PA5&amp;dq=hiawatha+edmonia+lewis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t2OyBOPZX8&amp;sig=0sFPHKd6DFWRVMK03f34NsPGPsk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK1tLU4IHUAhVBC8AKHbUlC6E4FBDoAQgiMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hiawatha%20edmonia%20lewis&amp;f=false|title=The Indomitable Spirit of Edmonia Lewis: A Narrative Biography|last=Henderson|first=Harry Brinton|last2=Henderson|first2=Albert|date=2012|publisher=Untreed Reads|isbn=9781588634528|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works became popular for collectors not only because of her high skill level, but also with the help of Lewis' tales, exaggerating her connection to her [[Native Americans in the United States|First Nations]] ancestry, having actually grown up in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], NJ, thus capitalizing on the popular culture's fascination with the "[[Noble savage|romantic primitive]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The pair of sculptures was acquired by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/edmonia-lewis-1845-after-1911-minnehaha-5880413-details.aspx|title=Edmonia Lewis (1845-after 1911)  , Minnehaha|website=www.christies.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from this pair of small busts, Lewis'&amp;nbsp;series includes ''Wooing of Hiawatha'' (or ''The Old Arrowmaker and His Daughter''),1866-1872, which one of six is in The Walter O. Evans Collection at the [[SCAD Museum of Art]], and ''The Marriage of Hiawatha and Minnehaha'' (or ''Hiawatha's Marriage'')'',''&amp;nbsp;1866–1868, rediscovered in 1991, which one of two is in the collection of [[Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artsandactivities.com/hiawathas-marriage-edmonia-lewis/|title=Hiawatha’s Marriage, Edmonia Lewis {{!}} Arts &amp; Activities|website=artsandactivities.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artist/?id=2914|title=Edmonia Lewis {{!}} Smithsonian American Art Museum|website=americanart.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hierarchy of genres''' is any formalization which ranks different  [[genre]]s in an art form in terms of their prestige and cultural value.

In literature, the [[Epic poetry|epic]] was considered the highest form, for the reason expressed by [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''Life of [[John Milton]]'': "By the general consent of criticks, the first praise of genius is due to the writer of an epick poem, as it requires an assemblage of all the powers which are singly sufficient for other compositions."  Below that came [[lyric poetry]], and comic poetry, with a similar ranking for [[drama]]. The [[novel]] took a long time to establish a firm place in the hierarchy, doing so only as belief in any systematic hierarchy of forms expired in the 19th century.

In music, settings of words were accorded a higher status than merely instrumental works, at least until the [[Baroque]] period, and [[opera]] retained a superior status for much longer.  The status of works also varies with the number of players and singers involved, with those for large forces, which are certainly more difficult to write and more expensive to perform, given higher status. Any element of comedy reduced the status of a work, though, as in other art forms, often increasing its popularity.

The hierarchies in figurative art are those initially formulated for painting in 16th-century Italy, which held sway with little alteration until the early 19th century.  These were formalized and promoted by the [[Academy|academies]] in Europe between the 17th century and the modern era, of which the most influential became the French [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]], which held a central role in [[Academic art]].  The fully developed hierarchy distinguished between:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Belton|first1=Dr. Robert J.|title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook|chapter=The Elements of Art|date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[History painting]], including historically important, religious, mythological, or allegorical subjects
*[[Portrait painting]]
*[[Genre works|Genre painting]] or scenes of everyday life
*[[landscape art|Landscape]] and cityscape art (landscapists were called "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" by the Dutch theorist [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]])
*[[Animal painting]]
*[[Still life]]

The hierarchy was based on a distinction between art that made an intellectual effort to "render visible the universal essence of things" (''imitare'' in Italian) and that which merely consisted of "mechanical copying of particular appearances" (''ritrarre'').&lt;ref&gt;Bass, 36 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6TSDvkud168C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Hierarchy+of+genres+painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Idealism]] was privileged over [[Philosophical realism|realism]] in line with [[Renaissance Neo-Platonist]] philosophy.

The term is mostly used within the field of painting, and from the [[High Renaissance]] onwards, by which time painting had asserted itself as the highest form of art.  This had not been the case in [[Medieval art]] and the art-commissioning sectors of society took a considerable period to fully accept this view.  The [[Raphael Cartoons]] are a clear example of the continuing status of [[tapestry]], the most expensive form of art in the 16th century.  In the Early Medieval period lavish pieces of metalwork had typically been the most highly regarded, and valuable materials remained an important ingredient in the appreciation of art until at least the 17th century.  Until the 19th century the most extravagant [[objets d'art]] remained more expensive, both new and on the art market, than all but a few paintings.  Classical writings which valued the supreme skills of individual artists were influential, as well as developments in art which allowed the Renaissance artist to demonstrate their skill and invention to a greater degree than was usually possible in the Middle Ages.

==Renaissance art==
The hierarchy grew out of the struggle  to gain acceptance of painting as one of the [[Liberal arts]], and then controversies to establish an equal or superior status within them with [[architecture]] and [[sculpture]].  These matters were considered of great importance by artist-theorists such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Giorgio Vasari]].  Against the sculptors, Leonardo argued that the intellectual effort necessary to create an illusion of three-dimensionality made the painters' art superior to that of the sculptor, who could do so merely by recording appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 28, 53-4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[De Pictura]]'' ("About Painting") of 1441, Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer.  He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 11-12,&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists of the Early and High Renaissance accepted the importance of representing nature closely, at least until the later writings of [[Michelangelo]], who was strongly influenced by [[neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 61, 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of [[Mannerist]] theorists such as [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]] and [[Federico Zuccari]] (both also painters) this was far less of a priority.  Both emphasized beauty as "something which was directly infused into the mind of man from the mind of God, and existed there independent of any sense-impressions", a view bound to further reduce the status of works depending on realism.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 140-141 (quote, 141)&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice the hierarchy represented little break with either medieval and classical thought, except to place secular history painting in the same class as religious art, and to distinguish (not always clearly) between static iconic religious subjects and narrative figure scenes, giving the latter a higher status.  Ideas of [[decorum]] also fed into the hierarchy; comic, sordid or merely frivolous subjects or treatment ranked lower than elevated and moral ones.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

During the Renaissance landscape, genre scenes and still lifes hardly existed as established genres, so discussion of the status or importance of different types of painting was mainly concerned with history subjects as against portraits, initially small and unpretentious, and iconic portrait-type religious and mythological subjects.  For most artists some commitment to realism was necessary in a portrait; few could take the high-handed approach of Michelangelo, who largely ignored the actual appearance of the [[Medici]] in his [[Medici Chapel]] sculptures, supposedly saying that in a thousand years no one would know the difference (a retort [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] is also said to have used, with a shorter timeframe).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many portraits were extremely flattering, which could be justified by an appeal to idealism as well as the sitter's vanity; the theorist [[Giovanni Battista Armenini|Armenini]]&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Battista Armenini (1533-1609) ''De vera precetti della pittura'' (1587), " On the True Precepts of the Art of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; claimed in 1587 that "portraits by excellent artists are considered to be painted with better style [''maniera''] and greater perfection than others, but more often than not they are less good likenesses".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 23-24 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, numbers of courtly sitters and their parents, suitors or courtiers complained that painters entirely failed to do justice to the reality of the sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 38-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of decorum in religious art became the focus of intense effort by the Catholic Church after the [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|decrees on art of the Council of Trent]] of 1563.  Paintings depicting biblical events as if they were occurring in the households of wealthy contemporary Italians were attacked, and soon ceased.  Until the challenge of [[Caravaggio]] at the end of the century, religious art became thoroughly ideal.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

==17th and 18th century art==
The new genres of landscape, genre painting, animal painting and still life came into their own in the 17th century, with the virtual cessation of religious painting in Protestant countries, and the expansion of picture buying to the prosperous middle class.  Although similar developments occurred in all advanced European countries, they were most evident in the enormously productive schools of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]].  However no theorists emerged to champion the new genres, and the relatively small amount of Dutch theoretical writing, by [[Karel van Mander]], [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]],&lt;ref&gt;''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'' ( Rotterdam 1678), "Introduction to the Academy of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerard de Lairesse]] and others, was mostly content to rehash Italian views, so that their writings can seem oddly at variance with the Dutch art actually being produced in their day.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

The hierarchy was mostly accepted by artists, and even genre specialists such as [[Jan Steen]], [[Karel Dujardin]] and [[Vermeer]] produced a few history paintings, which were better paid when commissions could be obtained, but in general far harder to sell.  The unhappy history of [[Rembrandt]]'s last history commission, ''[[The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis]]'' (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 69-77&lt;/ref&gt;  In Flanders, as well as great quantities of pure genre works, there was a trend towards history paintings with a major genre element, whether animals, landscape or still life.  Often the different elements were painted by different artists; [[Rubens]] and [[Frans Snyders]] often co-operated in this way.

The size of paintings, and very often the prices they realized, increasingly tended to reflect their position in the hierarchy in this period. Until the Romantic period the price and saleability of what were essentially landscapes could be increased by adding small mythological or religious figures, creating a ''landscape with...'', a practice that went back to the beginnings of landscape painting in the Flemish [[world landscape]]s of [[Joachim Patinir]] in the early 16th century. [[Flemish Baroque painting]] was the last school to often paint the lowest genres at a large size, but usually combined with figure subjects.

An influential formulation of 1667 by [[André Félibien]], a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:&lt;blockquote&gt;Celui qui fait parfaitement des païsages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne représentent que des choses mortes &amp; sans mouvement ; &amp; comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, &amp; ne peut prétendre à l'honneur que reçoivent les plus sçavans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure à la représentation de plusieurs ensemble ; il faut traiter l'histoire &amp; la fable ; il faut représenter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agréables comme les Poëtes ; &amp; montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions allégoriques, sçavoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, &amp; les mystères les plus relevez.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jl8IAeoj-7IC&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Books.google.co.uk], translation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more estimable than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled.  For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allegorical painting was raised above other types of [[history painting]]; together they were the ''grand genre'', including paintings with religious, mythological, historical, literary, or allegorical subjects—they embodied some interpretation of life or conveyed a moral or intellectual message. The gods and goddesses from the ancient mythologies represented different aspects of the human psyche, figures from religions represented different ideas, and history, like the other sources, represented a dialectic or play of ideas. Subjects with several figures ranked higher than single figures. For a long time, especially during the [[French Revolution]], history painting often focused on depiction of the heroic male nude; though this waned in the 19th century.

After history painting came, in order of decreasing worth: [[Portrait painting|portraits]], scenes of everyday life (called ''scènes de genre'', or "[[Genre works|genre painting]]", and also ''petit genre'' to contrast it with the ''grande genre''), [[Landscape art|landscapes]], animal painting, and finally [[still life]]s. In his formulation, such paintings were inferior because they were merely reportorial pictures without moral force or artistic imagination. Genre paintings—neither ideal in style, nor elevated in subject—were admired for their skill, ingenuity, and even humour, but never confused with high art. 

The hierarchy of genres also had a corresponding hierarchy of formats: large format for history paintings, small format for still lifes.  This had occasionally been breached in the past, especially in large Flemish works, and the monumental ''[[The Young Bull]]'' of the Dutch artist [[Paulus Potter]], as well as the larger of the two ''[[Butchers' Shop]]'' canvases of [[Annibale Carracci]].  But for the most part the relative prices obtainable for the different genres ensured the hierarchy of size also; it would not have been economic to paint a very large subject from the lower genres, except for commissioned group portraits.  Rubens' largest landscapes were painted for his own houses.

The use of the pictorial elements of painting such as line and color to convey an ultimate unifying theme or idea was regarded as the highest expression of art, and an idealism was adopted in art, whereby forms seen in nature would be generalized, and in turn subordinated to the unity of the artwork. It aimed at universal truth through the imitation of nature. Later  dissenting theorists, such as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], held that this focus on [[allegory]] was faulty and based on a wrong analogy between the plastic arts and poetry rooted in the [[Horace|Horatian]] dictum [[ut pictura poesis]] ("as is painting so is poetry").

The British painter [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] in his ''Discourses'' of the 1770s and 1780s, reiterated the argument for still life to the lowest position in the hierarchy of genres on the grounds that it interfered with the painter's access to central forms, those products of the mind's generalising powers. At the summit reigned history painting, centred on the human body: familiarity with the forms of the body permitted the mind of the painter, by comparing innumerable instances of the human form, to abstract from it those typical or central features that represented the body's essence or ideal.

Though Reynolds agreed with Félibien about the natural order of the genres, he held that an important work from any genre of painting could be produced under the hand of genius: "Whether it is the human figure, an animal, or even inanimate objects, there is nothing, however unpromising in appearance, but may be raised into dignity, convey sentiment, and produce emotion, in the hands of a painter of genius. What was said of [[Virgil]], that he threw even the dung about the ground with an air of dignity, may be applied to [[Titian]]; whatever he touched, however naturally mean, and habitually familiar, by a kind of magic he invested with grandeur and importance."

Though European academies usually strictly insisted on this hierarchy, over their reign, many artists were able to invent new genres which raised the lower subjects to the importance of history painting. Reynolds himself achieved this by inventing the portraiture style that was called the [[Grand Manner]], where he flattered his sitters by likening them to mythological characters. [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]] invented a genre that was called [[fêtes galantes]], where he would show scenes of courtly amusements taking place in Arcadian setting; these often had a poetic and allegorical quality which were considered to ennoble them. 

[[Claude Lorrain]] practised a genre called the [[ideal landscape]], where a composition would be loosely based on nature and dotted with classical ruins as a  setting for a biblical or historical theme. It artfully combined landscape and history painting, thereby legitimising the former. It is synonymous with the term ''historical landscape'' which received official recognition in the Académie française when a [[Prix de Rome]] for the genre was established in 1817. Finally, [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] was able to create still life paintings that were considered to have the charm and beauty as to be placed alongside the best allegorical subjects. However, aware of this hierarchy, Chardin began including figures in his work in about 1730, mainly women and children.

==19th century==
[[Romanticism]] greatly increased the status of landscape painting, beginning in [[British art]] and more gradually that of genre painting, which began to influence history painting in the anecdotal treatments of the [[Style Troubadour]] in France and equivalent trends elsewhere. Landscapes grew in size to reflect their new importance, often matching history paintings, especially in the American [[Hudson River School]] and Russian painting. Animal paintings also increased in size and dignity, but the full-length portrait, even of royalty, became mostly reserved for large public buildings.

Until the middle of the 19th century, [[women artists|women]] were largely unable to paint history paintings as they were not allowed to participate in the final process of artistic training—that of life drawing, in order to protect their modesty. They could work from reliefs, prints, casts and from the Old Masters, but not from the nude model. Instead they were encouraged to participate in the lower painting forms such as portraiture, landscape and genre. These were considered more feminine in that they appealed to the eye rather than the mind.

Toward the end of the 19th century, painters and critics began to rebel against the many rules of the Académie française, including the status accorded to [[history painting]], which was beginning to be bought mainly by public bodies of one sort or another, as private buyers preferred subjects from lower down the hierarchy.  In Britain the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement tried to revitalize the history painting, with mixed success; other movements made similar efforts.  Many Pre-Raphaelites ended their careers mainly painting other subjects.  New artistic movements included the [[Realism (visual arts)|Realists]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], which each sought to depict the present moment and daily life as observed by the eye, and unattatched from historical significance; the Realists often choosing genre painting and still life, while the Impressionists would most often focus on landscapes.

'''''Interior of a Restaurant in Arles''''' is a colored oil painting executed by the Dutch artist [[Vincent van Gogh]] on an industrially primed canvas of size 25 ''(Toile de 25 figure)'' in [[Arles]], France, late August, 1888.

Accurately dating ''Interior of a Restaurant in Arles'' has been difficult, largely because van Gogh never mentioned the painting in any existing letter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vangoghletters.org See www.vangoghletters.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Leprohon placed it in late August, 1888, due in part to the blossoming sunflowers&lt;ref&gt;Leprohon, Pierre, ''Tel fut Van Gogh'', Editions du Sud, 1964, p 415&lt;/ref&gt; and this has been generally accepted, including by leading 20th century van Gogh scholar [[Jan Hulsker]].&lt;ref name= "Hulsker 356"&gt;Hulsker p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of two studies Vincent created of this restaurant, the other being ''Interior of the Restaurant Carrel in Arles''. Long supposed to be a view from inside the Hotel Carrel, [[Jacob Baart de la Faille | de la Faille]] remarks they were probably the interior of the restaurant next to the [[Yellow House (painting) | Yellow House]]''.&lt;ref&gt;De La Faille p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genesis==

While certainly a representation of diners in Arles (regardless of the cafe), in his article ''Van Gogh's Last Supper: Transforming "the guise of observable reality,"'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arths.org.uk/about/arthsa/issue41 See Art History Supplement, Vol. 4, Issue 1, January, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Baxter argues this is van Gogh's initial attempt in creating a [[Symbolist]] or [[Boats du Rhône|''sacred realism'']] &lt;ref&gt;See Silverman, Debora, Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Search for Sacred Art, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Last Supper]]'':{{quote|text=There are a number of similarities between this painting and [[Renaissance]] Last Suppers. In the center is a serving figure. Most of the diners are stretched along the far side of the table. Three wine carafes feature prominently in the foreground. Admittedly, not much, but it is a start ...}}

Although Hulsker argued that determining whether this or its sister painting came first would be speculation,&lt;ref group= "Notes"&gt;Hulsker did not believe JH1572 was a preliminary sketch for JH1573 and suggested that Vincent made two near identical copies because one was intended for the owner of the cafe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Hulsker 356"/&gt; Baxter offers the following argument: the second version is painted in a [[Cloisonnist]] style, giving it a stained glass window effect, a suitable medium for a ''Last Supper'' painting; and van Gogh has made a number of changes to the final version, most notably: adding bread and placing a new wine bottle before the central serving figure, giving it emphasis. Furthermore, van Gogh added more diners, including the figure hiding behind, what was once a vase of flowers, now appears to be a palm frond. Also, the flower arrangement on the left now resembles the top of a [[Pollaxe|poll axe]] and is at about the same position where [[Simon Peter]] wields a blade in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[The Last Supper (da Vinci)|version]]. But most importantly, right next to it, van Gogh has replicated Leonardo’s leaning image of the [[apostle John]], van Gogh’s favorite.&lt;ref&gt;See Naifeh &amp; Smith, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, van Gogh has enframed a female serving figure within vases of flowers, a motif he would return to months later with his ''[[The Roulin Family (Van Gogh series)|Berceuse]]'' triptych.&lt;ref&gt;Van Uitert, Evert, ''Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin in competition: Vincent’s original contribution'', in ''Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', Vol. 11, No. 2 (1980), pp. 81-106&lt;/ref&gt; And lastly, all the empty chairs, which can be immediately recognizable from ''[[Vincent van Gogh's Décoration for the Yellow House|Vincent’s Chair]]'', also his ''[[Vincent van Gogh's Décoration for the Yellow House|Bedroom in Arles]]'', and he’d just bought twelve to furnish the [[Yellow House (painting)|Yellow House]] literally hours before beginning his final Symbolist's ''Last Supper'' ''[[Café Terrace at Night]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let677/letter.html#n-2 See www.vangoghletters.org Letter 677, note 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Just Buffalo Literary Center''' (JBLC) is a not-for-profit literary organization centered in [[Buffalo, NY]] which serves the greater [[Western New York]] region as a prominent literary curator. Just Buffalo Literary Center’s mission is to create and strengthen communities through the literary arts. And for more than 40 years, Just Buffalo Literary Center has brought the world’s greatest writers to Buffalo, hosted poetry events, and readings, and supported the development of young writers.

Just Buffalo Literary Center's business office is currently located above the Western New York Book Arts Center on Washington Street.

==History==
===Inception===
Just Buffalo began in 1975 when founder Debora Ott hosted a reading featuring Diane di Prima at the Allentown Community Center. In the following years, notable authors and poets such as [[Robert Creeley]], [[Ed Dorn]], [[Alice Notley]], [[Maureen Owen]], and [[Ted Berrigan]] came to Buffalo to participate in readings offered by what had by then become "Just Buffalo".
The organization proceeded to host writing workshops for writers of all-ages and published a literary magazine. It also had a radio show.

===Continued growth===
In 1982, Just Buffalo Literary Center established its renowned Writers in Education program, providing in-school creative writing programs for young people. At their peak, this program served approximately 4,000 students per year. After more than two decades of stewarding community-based literary programs and establishing Just Buffalo Literary Center as a national presence on the literary scene, Debora left the organization in 1998. She hired Michael Kelleher as Artistic Director in the months before she left. Ed Taylor served as Executive Director from 1998-2001.

===2002-present===
Laurie Dean Torrell took over as Executive Director in 2002, ushering in a new era. During her tenure, Just Buffalo Literary Center has experienced an extraordinary expansion. It moved from the Tri-Main Center to the Market Arcade Building in 2005, a change which marked the beginning of a groundbreaking administrative collaboration with CEPA and Big Orbit Galleries. All three organizations benefited from this long-term effort that involves shared resources and staff as well as a joint education effort, Writing With Light. In 2016, Just Buffalo Literary Center moved from the Market Arcade Building to its current home on the second floor at the corner of Washington and Mohawk in downtown Buffalo.

Just Buffalo Literary Center's program office staff currently consists of Laurie Dean Torrell, Executive Director; Barbara Cole, Artistic Director; Noah Falck, Education Director; Kristen Pope, Development Director.

==Programs==
===BABEL===

BABEL is an international literary lecture series that brings notable authors to Buffalo to speak four times per year. It is cosponsored by [[Hallwalls]]. It was conceived of in 2006 by Michael Kelleher, who was at the time Just Buffalo's Artistic Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Colin Dabkowski |url=http://www.buffalonews.com/entertainment/gusto/books/article808973.ece |title=The man who built Babel - Books &amp; Poetry |publisher=The Buffalo News |date=2012-04-15 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was launched in 2007. Past authors have included Nobel Prize winners [[Orhan Pamuk]], [[Derek Walcott]] and [[V.S. Naipaul]], as well as global literary icons [[Isabel Allende]], [[Amos Oz]], [[Salman Rushdie]], [[A.S. Byatt]], [[Chinua Achebe]] and many others.

BABEL was initially hosted in folk-musician [[Ani Difranco]]'s recording space, "Babeville", in the old [[Asbury Delaware United Methodist Church]], until it outgrew the space late in its second season and moved to [[Kleinhans Music Hall]].

In 2009, BABEL was awarded "Most Innovative Arts Programming (any artform)" by Buffalo Spree Magazine. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalospree.com/buffalospreemagazine/archives/2009_0708/070809bestofarts.html |title=Buffalo Spree Magazine |publisher=Buffalospree.com |date=1979-06-26 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BABEL series has been hailed by the [[Buffalo News]] as:

:''...one of the most exciting literary series Buffalo has ever seen.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Simon |url=http://www.buffalonews.com/entertainment/article392438.ece |title=Babel books top global writers for 2011-12 season - Entertainment |publisher=The Buffalo News |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing BABEL in its first year, Kelleher states:

'''''Kreeta Haapasalo Playing the Kantele in a Peasant Cottage ''''' is an oil work on canvas painted in 1868 by [[Robert Wilhelm Ekman]] (1808-1873).

== Description ==
The dimensions of the painting are 75 × 105&amp;nbsp;cm. It was purchased for the collection of the [[Ateneum]] in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063618/FI_280_001.html|title=Kreeta Haapasalo Playing the Kantele in a Peasant Cottage|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of people listen to a [[kantele]] playing. This includes the mistress of the house, young women and their children. Leaning in the corner is a pipe-smoking soldier. The environment is simple, related to their everyday chores, and lit by a daylit window. The work reflects an idealized vision of the Finnish nation and its values.

== Analysis ==
[[Kreeta Haapasalo]] was a well-known folk musician who in periods of famine in the 1860s fed a family by traveling as a [[kantele]] player, singing poetry. It brought her great popularity at a time of great interest in the roots of the Finnish people. Haapasalo was seen at the time as part of an ancient tradition as an interpreter of the [[Kalevala]], through which she was able to get in touch with genuine Finnish culture.

Robert Ekman, the painter, was interested in the origins of Finnish culture. Ekman studied at the Stockholm Academy of Art. He was interested in historical development and the public life of the Finnish people. His genre paintings depicting it were well received. He returned to Finland on a permanent basis, after an Italian and French tour in 1845, after which he taught until his death in [[Turku]] drawing school, which he established in the following year.

[[File:Mural of Singapore Landmarks, The Centrepoint, Singapore, September 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Mural of Singapore Landmarks located at the basement of [[The Centrepoint]] shopping centre]]
'''Singapore Murals''' is an integral part of the nation's aspiration of being a renaissance city but is under developed. A Public [[Mural]] is a source of heritage building, expression of the [[arts]], national education, interactivity of interests groups.

==Publications==

There are many publications found globally that showcase street art (both graffiti and commission works). However, there are not sufficient resources in Singapore. For example, in Page One bookstores dozens of books about Vandalism on Trains can be found.

==Location==
In [[Singapore]], public murals exist primarily in three aspects:

===Commercially commissioned works===

[[File:Radin Mas Community Centre Mural1.png|thumb|right|alt=A mural at the Radin Mas Community Centre. |A mural at the Radin Mas Community Centre]]

This mainly take the form of corporate malls but more prominently by the [[Land Transport Authority (Singapore)|Land Transport Authority]] in its building of Mass Rapid Trains. The theory of "the less the artist is paid, the more autonomy he has" is very relevant to understand of murals.

===Void-decks and facade of centres===
The Singapore residential area is mainly high rise HDB Flats. The first floor of HDB Flats&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hdb.gov.sg HDB.gov.sg]&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly used by Educational Centres, venue of Residential Committees/Community Clubs. These centres do carry some murals.

===The inbetweens or the "illegals"===
[[Street Art]] does exist in between sewage drains, the back of alleys and landed properties and even power boxes.

==History==
The oldest mural in Singapore can be traced to [[Changi Murals]], which still are in existence. There were previous recorded murals in Orchard Road and some parks. However, they do not exist currently.

===Orchard Road===
In 1985, Organised by Wisma Development Pte Ltd and Forum Development Pte Ltd attracted [[Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts]] and St Patricks's Arts Centre to create 7 murals along Orchard Road. The hoardings at Atria was divided into 14 panels per team, each panel were 4.5m to 2.2m. The painting themes were evolution of shopping in Singapore and evolution of lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19850805.2.25.20.aspx Newspapers.nl.sg]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chijmes===
[[File:Chijmes Mural.png|thumb|left|1987 Chijmes Mural.]]

The next prominent mural in Singapore arrives at the facade of Chijmes in 1987. Le Mur Lion; The Lion Wall, portrays and tells through imagery the rousing myth about a lion and its struggling journey towards finding a better world. Stretched across the walls on Brash Basah Road estimated to be about 125 meters, it was apparently assumed to be the longest wall mural in Singapore.

===Bras Basah Murals===
In 2004, the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] introduced the Bras Basah Murals. Named after the 1815 [[Battle of Waterloo]], Waterloo street is now known for its rich housing towards the arts.

To further enhance this area as a hub for Arts, Culture, Learning and Entertainment three wall murals have since been produced and unveiled along Waterloo Street. These murals were a collaborative effort from the students of NAFA and Lasalle-SIA and URA (Urban Redevelopment Authority).

Located at the boundary wall of Stamford arts centre, the first two wall murals located at the wall of Stamford Arts Centre, were painted by URA and Lasalle-sia students. The art direction for these two murals was to bring out the unique blend of architecture in the area. A significant amount of different colours was used to represent architecture and rich cultural heritage that is prominent with the many religious buildings in the Bras Basah area.

The third mural, which was produced by NAFA, is meant to depict the challenges women face in our society. The site-specific mural, which stands next to the SCWO Centre further instills the message.

===2010 Bras Basah Complex Mural===

The project was facilitated through the assistance of the National Volunteerism and Philanthropy Centre that engaged the American Chambers of Commerce Day. Over 100 volunteer hours were team up together to create a colour masterpiece led by budding artist Koochi who was mentored by Asst Professor Eileen Reynolds from [[Nanyang Technological University]]. Completed on 13 November 2010, the artworks represent different colours coming together and movement forward for the Arts. The artwork was themed to "arrangement" which is similar to  books and arts. Bras Basah Complex is known for its niche of Books and Arts materials.

==Mural.sg Launch==
The beta version (Wikipedia) page of Murals.sg was launched on 19 October 2010 by Member of Parliament Ms Penny Low. The Punggol North GROs kindly hosted a tea reception for over 100 participants of the mural painting and will not be possible through the kind assistance of the Social Innovation Park and PCF.

Through the assistance of the National Volunteerism and Philanthropy Centre, over 15 collaborations were made to further strengthen murals painting in Singapore. Their assistance include the introduction of corporate volunteers and funds.

==People involved==
* Mentor Artist: Professional artists, lecturers and practicing artists who have organised exhibitions both solo and group
before.  They concentrate of specific themes and styles. Their take away are acts are sharing of talents, education to youths and volunteerism.
* Budding Artists: Students of Art or working adults who does art as a hobby. They received avenues of expression, opportunities of interactions, character development.
* Interest Groups (non-artists): People with similar attributes or affiliated with a registered charity i.e. youths at risks, elderly etc. This include corporate volunteers as well and/or social service groups. Art therapy, team bonding and community message.

==Internationalisation==

In the United Kingdom, the Off The Wall organisation brought Invergorden Mural Trail that was officiated by Her Princess Royal and the total transformation costs over GBP 220,000. It was commissioned by the [[European Union]].

Programmes such as City of Philadelphia Mural Arts Programme, City Without Walls in New Jersey, Community Murals in UK and many others work towards addressing key issues and concerns in the society such as affordable housing, health, education and other issues, and at the same time bringing communities together.

==Mural Organisations==
There were quite a number of organisations and public bodies coming up with murals. However, most of them are ad hoc efforts. For example, the URA Bras Basah Murals are currently peeling off at this very second.

===*scape===
*scape started as a department of youth ventures in the National Youth Council (government) but later become a company limited by guarantee. It manages the Skate Park, Youth Park and *scape centre. With an emphasis of a youth space, many activities are organised. A whole building mural at *scape centre was launched. There used to be an area at youth park where any artist can paint on the walls. However, since 2008, prior approval was needed. *scape activities seemed to be within their spaces.  In August 2014, *scape engaged Built from Skratch, Project Burnerz (Asno Doink, S13 &amp; Myow) and KiddVybe &amp; his Brother Syafiq to recreate a new mural

==Challenges of Singapore Murals==
Singapore Murals faced several main challenges.

* Overlap of government involvement without a clear direction on whose mandate are public murals. Is Community Art more Community or Artistic, and both have different ministries looking into its development.
* Strict [[vandalism]] laws which were highlighted by a recent vandalism on [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT Train]] by a [[Swiss people|Swiss National]].
* No free walls. *scape allows artists in particular graffiti artists to spray cans on their walls. However, from 2008 prior approval of artwork was needed.
* Artistic delivery. As most venues belong are in community space, public murals are at the risk of being too inline with government campaigns in their artworks. On 08.07.2010, [[The Straits Times]] reported that an anti-drug mural was completed.
* Dilution of artistic merits because of government being too involved. In 2012, the government issued a 210million dollars for arts-culture community engagement. However, the amount went mainly to People's Association that hires an untrained arts officer at each community club (approx 84).&lt;ref&gt;http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20120410-338803.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore Murals goes beyond [[painting]]. Murals in MRT Trains do contain built in wall sculptures as well as cemented drawings. Murals which are painting based seemed to relate greater to graffiti than [[fine arts]]. Here are some of the murals found in Singapore

===Mural about Baharudin Vocational Institute===
[[File:Baharudin Vocational Institute.png|thumb|right|alt=A mural at the Baharuddin Vocational Institute. |A mural at the Baharuddin Vocational Institute]]

Being one of the first ever art devoted school; Baharuddin Vocational Institute grew from humble grounds. From various name changes over the years and starting without a building of their own, they had to resort to borrowing premises to house their students.

In 1970, they moved into their own building where they housed students undertaking courses from graphic design to doll making. Baharuddin Vocational Institute was more than just a school. I say this because as surprising as it may seem now, it was the first and only school to provide art courses in the 1970s. Thus being the only faculty that taught students everything artistically involved, Baharuddin Vocational Institute gave birth to our very first locally taught creative individuals. These individuals such as Zoe Tay and Makansutra’s KF Seetoh were great additions to Singapore’s creative industry.

===Mint Museum===
Opened on 5 March 2007, [[Mint Museum of Toys|Mint (Moment of Imagination and Nostalgia with Toys) Museum]] was illuminated with is signature mural designed and painted by [[Norway|Norwegian]] artist, Einstein Kristiansen.

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Mint Museum.png|thumb|right|alt=The Mint Museum of Toys' signature mural designed and painted by Norwegian artist, Einstein Kristiansen.|The Mint Museum of Toys' signature mural designed and painted by Norwegian [[artist]], Einstein Kristiansen. {{deletable image-caption|Friday, October 22, 2010|date=October 2010}}]] --&gt;

The main artistic direction as quoted by Mr. Kristiansen "The first piece of art a child does, when introduced to a pencil"

With vast use of colours, texture through shading and meticulous details, this mural was entitled "Krusedulle". Krusedulle, the Norwegian word for doodles is meant to depict the museum and the collectables of the toys it carries.

This mural is dissected into five panels.

===Tribute to Street-Side Hawker===
[[File:Hawker Mural.png|thumb|left|Stirling Road mural dedicated to street side hawkers.]]

Located at Blk 123, Stirling Road, this mural was created in dedicatory and recognition to all street side hawkers.

===Colours of Diversity===
[[File:Colours of Diversity Mural.png|thumb|Volunteers hard at work on the Colours of Diversity Mural by Keppel Corporation and Social Creatives.]]

In Social Creatives series of 20 murals around Queenstown, Colours of Diversity was the last installation to mark the end of this massive transformation project around the area. During this process, social creative managed to capture the support of Keppel Corp.; a leading organization. This led to the collaboration and community engaging experience. Keppel Volunteers decided to lend a hand while social creatives lent them the [[paint]] and [[brushes]].

===Water Polo===
[[File:Water Polo Mural.png|thumb|left|alt=The water polo mural opposite the Queenstown Swimming Complex.|The water polo mural opposite the Queenstown Swimming Complex.]]

On 11 December 2009, this mural was completed opposite the Queens Town Swimming Complex. The artist was Mr. Raziz a.k.a. Wonder. With him, a group of migrant workers actually volunteered in the production of this piece of work.

===Splat===
[[File:Splat Mural.png|thumb|right|alt=The Splat mural.|The Splat mural.]]

This mural was created by young artists Cheryl, Beryl and Ching. Entitled ''Faces of Singapore'', this black and white design features the facial expressions of all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:1x4Wr9zFpiQJ:www.nac.gov.sg/static/doc/Instep/Instep_MarApr_10.pdf+splat+murals+at+middle+road&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=sg Webcache.googleusercontent.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Story of Radin Mas===
[[File:Radin Mass Community Centre Mural4.png|thumb|alt=The "Story of Radin Mas" mural.|The "Story of Radin Mas" mural.]]

This mural above depicts the life behind Radin Mas. It was led by German artist Jan Kolster and Singaporean Gladys Teo. The project engaged 200 [[elderly]] people and was launched by Mr Sam Tan, Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Information, Communication and the Arts on 20 December 2010.

[[Radin Mas]] was a young and beautiful princess who unfortunately came across an ill-fated life. She was killed accidentally while someone else was trying to kill her father. Before death, her life was not much easier. She was forced to wed the evil Tengku Bagus while her father was held in captivity in a well.

===Punggol Murals===
Punggol was given a face lift with a serious dose of colour and vibrancy on from organised programmes in July to October 2010. A series of 15 walls were transformed with the help of about 500 participants from Standard Chartered Bank, Temasek Poly, NTUC Fairprice, Mercer, Daimler SEA and so on. With such massive collaboration, the participants walked away feeling proud that each and every one of them became an artist that day.

Murals currently exist in two sub towns of Punggol which are Edgedale Plains and EdgeField.

===Street (Void-Deck) Art Gallery===

In 2011, Social Creatives launched an initiative that transform the first floor and common space of a residential area into an art gallery which are inspired by the artworks of Vincent van Gogh. Another gallery was launched in 2012 but through the impressions of pop art masterpieces. This signature initiative of Social Creatives has appeared on local TV shows and even on CNN. According to an article by CNN: In straight-laced Singapore, where graffiti tag artists can get sent to prison, one void deck goes permissibly "defaced." In this case, the void deck of Block 56 on Pipit Road, MacPherson, is "defaced" with the postimpressionist works of Vincent van Gogh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.cnn.com/singapore/play/macpherson-singapores-first-void-deck-art-gallery-699626]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, People's Association gave an award to the supporting grassroots organisation of Social Creatives and created a Community Arts Gallery Initiative where any community club is eligible to apply a $15,000 grant to create their own art "void deck" or community gallery. According to a Today's newspaper article, the artworks were found to be amateurish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/events/319726994781061/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayonline.com/CultureAndLifestyle/EDC120903-0000007/all-aboard!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904030527/http://www.todayonline.com/CultureAndLifestyle/EDC120903-0000007/all-aboard%21 |date=4 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14168">'''Psychoanalytic literary criticism''' is [[literary criticism]] or [[literary theory]] which, in method, concept, or form, is influenced by the tradition of [[psychoanalysis]] begun by [[Sigmund Freud]].

Psychoanalytic reading has been practiced since the early development of psychoanalysis itself, and has developed into a heterogeneous interpretive tradition. As [[Celine Surprenant]] writes, 'Psychoanalytic literary criticism does not constitute a unified field. However, all variants endorse, at least to a certain degree, the idea that literature ... is fundamentally entwined with the psyche'.&lt;ref&gt;Celine Surprenant, 'Freud and Psychoanalysis' in Patricia Waugh ed., ''Literary Theory and Criticism'' (OUP 2006) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The object of psychoanalytic literary criticism, at its very simplest, can be the psychoanalysis of the [[author]] or of a particularly interesting character in a given work. The criticism is similar to psychoanalysis itself, closely following the analytic interpretive process discussed in Freud's ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' and other works. Critics may view the fictional characters as psychological [[case study|case studies]], attempting to identify such Freudian concepts as the [[Oedipus complex]], [[Freudian slip]]s, [[Id, ego and superego]], and so on, and demonstrate how they influence the thoughts and behaviors of fictional characters.

However, more complex variations of psychoanalytic criticism are possible. The concepts of psychoanalysis can be deployed with reference to the narrative or poetic structure itself, without requiring access to the authorial psyche (an interpretation motivated by French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]'s remark that "the unconscious is structured like a language"). Or the founding texts of psychoanalysis may themselves be treated as literature, and re-read for the light cast by their formal qualities on their theoretical content (Freud's texts frequently resemble [[Detective fiction|detective stories]], or the archaeological narratives of which he was so fond).

Like all forms of literary criticism, psychoanalytic criticism can yield useful clues to the sometime baffling symbols, actions, and settings in a literary work; however, like all forms of literary criticism, it has its limits. For one thing, some critics rely on psychocriticism as a "one size fits all" approach, when other literary scholars argue that no one approach can adequately illuminate or interpret a complex work of art. As Guerin, et al. put it in ''A Handbook of Critical Approaches to Literature'',&lt;ref&gt;Guerin, Wilfred L., et al., A Handbook of Critical Approaches to Literature (Harper &amp; Row, 1979). {{ISBN|0-06-042554-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The danger is that the serious student may become theory-ridden, forgetting that Freud's is not the only approach to literary criticism. To see a great work of fiction or a great poem primarily as a psychological case study is often to miss its wider significance and perhaps even the essential aesthetic experience it should provide.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Methods==
===Early applications===
Freud wrote several important essays on literature, which he used to explore the psyche of authors and characters, to explain narrative mysteries, and to develop new concepts in psychoanalysis (for instance, ''[[Delusion and Dream in Jensen's Gradiva]]'' and his influential readings of the [[Oedipus]] myth and [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''). The criticism has been made, however, that in his and his early followers' studies 'what calls for elucidation are not the artistic and literary works themselves, but rather the psychopathology and biography of the artist, writer or fictional characters'.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'many psychoanalysts among Freud's earliest adherents did not resist the temptation to psychoanalyze poets and painters (sometimes to Freud's chagrin').&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (London 1989) p. 764&lt;/ref&gt; Later analysts would conclude that 'clearly one cannot psychoanalyse a writer from his text; one can only appropriate him'.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Early psychoanalytic literary criticism would often treat the text as if it were a kind of [[dream]]. This means that the text represses its real (or latent) content behind obvious (manifest) content. The process of changing from latent to manifest content is known as the dream work, and involves operations of concentration and  [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]].  The critic analyzes the language and [[symbol]]ism of a text to reverse the process of the dream work and arrive at the underlying latent thoughts. The danger is that 'such criticism tends to be reductive, explaining away the ambiguities of works of literature by reference to established psychoanalytic doctrine; and very little of this work retains much influence today'.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (New York 1995) p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jungians===
Later readers, such as [[Carl Jung]] and another of Freud's disciples, [[Karen Horney]], broke with Freud, and their work, especially Jung's, led to other rich branches of psychoanalytic criticism: Horney's to feminist approaches including [[womb envy]], and Jung's to the study of [[archetypes]] and the [[collective unconscious]]. Jung's  work in particular was influential as, combined with the work of anthropologists such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Joseph Campbell]], it led to the entire fields of [[mythocriticism]] and archetype analysis.

[[Northrop Frye]] considered that 'the literary critic finds Freud most suggestive for the theory of comedy, and Jung for the theory of romance'.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1973) p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

===Form===
Waugh writes, 'The development of psychoanalytic approaches to literature proceeds from the shift of emphasis from "content" to the fabric of artistic and literary works'.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example [[Hayden White]] has explored how 'Freud's descriptions tally with nineteenth-century theories of [[Trope (literature)|tropes]], which his work somehow reinvents'.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially influential here has been the work of [[Jacques Lacan]], an avid reader of literature who used literary examples as illustrations of important concepts in his work (for instance, Lacan argued with [[Jacques Derrida]] over the interpretation of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s "[[The Purloined Letter]]").

'Lacan's theories have encouraged a criticism which focuses not on the author but on the linguistic processes of the text'.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge 1995) p. 767&lt;/ref&gt; Within this Lacanian emphasis, 'Freud's theories become a place from which to raise questions of interpretation, rhetoric, style, and figuration'.&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Lacanian scholars have noted that Lacan himself was not interested in literary criticism ''per se'', but in how literature might illustrate a psychoanalytic method or concept.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Dylan (2005). "From Lacan to Darwin" in ''The Literary Animal; Evolution and the Nature of Narrative'', eds. Jonathan Gottschall and David Sloan Wilson, Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 2005, pp.38-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reader response===
According to Ousby, 'Among modern critical uses of psychoanalysis is the development of "[[ego psychology]]" in the work of [[Norman Holland]], who concentrates on the relations between reader and text'&lt;ref&gt;Ousby ed., p. 767&lt;/ref&gt; - as with [[reader response criticism]].  Rollin writes that 'Holland's experiments in reader response theory suggest that we all read literature selectively, unconsciously projecting our own fantasies into it'.&lt;ref&gt;L. Rollin/M. I. West, ''Psychoanalytic Responses to Children's Literature'' (2008) p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus in [[crime fiction]], for example, '[[Charles Rycroft|Rycroft]] sees the criminal as personifying the reader's unavowed hostility to the parent'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shepherd, ''Sherlock Holmes and the Case of Dr Freud'' (London 1985) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Mauron: psychocriticism===
In 1963, [[Charles Mauron]]&lt;ref&gt;Des métaphores obsédantes au mythe ersonnel&lt;/ref&gt; conceived a structured method to interpret literary works via psychoanalysis. The study implied four different phases:
# The creative process is akin to dreaming awake: as such, it is a [[mimesis|mimetic]], and [[cathartic]], representation of an innate desire that is best expressed and revealed by '''metaphors''' and symbolically.
# Then, the juxtaposition of a writer's works leads the critic to define symbolical themes.
# These metaphorical networks are significant of a latent inner reality.
# They point at an obsession just as dreams can do. The last phase consists in linking the writer's literary creation to his own personal life.

On Mauron's concept, the author cannot be reduced to a ratiocinating self: his own more or less [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] biographical past, the cultural [[archetypes]] that have suffused his "soul" contrast with the conscious self, The chiasmic relation between the two tales may be seen as a sane and safe [[acting out]]. A basically [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] sexual impulse is symbolically fulfilled in a positive and socially gratifying way, a process known as [[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]].

===Anxiety of influence===
'The American critic [[Harold Bloom]] has adopted the Freudian notion of the [[Oedipus Complex]] to his study of relationships of influence between poets...and his work has also inspired a [[feminist]] variant in the work of [[Sandra Gilbert]] and [[Susan Gubar]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Childers/Hentzi eds., p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

In similar vein, [[Shoshana Felman]] has asked with respect to what she calls "''the guilt of poetry''" the question: 'Could literary history be in any way considered as a repetitive unconscious ''[[transference]]'' of the guilt of poetry?'.&lt;ref&gt;Shoshana Felman, ''Jacques Lacan and the Adventures of Insight'' (Harvard 1987) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==
In ''[[Small World: An Academic Romance]]'', one of [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]]'s satires of academia, the naive hero Persse follows Angelica to a forum where she discourses on Romance: '"[[Roland Barthes]] has taught us the close connection between narrative and sexuality, between the pleasures of the body and the 'pleasure of the text'....Romance is a multiple orgasm." Persse listened to this stream of filth flowing from between Angelica's exquisite lips and pearly teeth with growing astonishment and burning cheeks, but no one else in the audience seemed to find anything remarkable or disturbing about her presentation'.&lt;ref&gt;David Lodge, ''Small World'' (Penguin 1985) p. 322-3&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[A.S. Byatt]]'s novel ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]]'', the heroine/feminist scholar, while recognising that '"we live in the truth of what Freud discovered"', concedes that '"the whole of our scholarship – the whole of our thought – we question everything except the centrality of sexuality"'.&lt;ref&gt;A. S Byatt, ''Possession: A Romance'' (London 1990) p. 254 and p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Queer Crips: Disabled Gay Men and Their Stories''''' is a 2004 anthology edited by Bob Guter and John R. Killacky. The book is a  collection of personal stories from gay men with disabilities. The stories are told through a variety of literary genres, including poetry, prose, and interviews. The book won the [[2004 Lambda Literary Awards|2004 Lambda Literary Award]] for the Anthologies/Non-fiction category. Contributors to the book include gay men such as [[Greg Walloch]], [[Kenny Fries]], [[J. Quinn Brisben]], and [[Eli Clare]]. After being turned down for publication by 30 publishers, the anthology was finally published by Harrington Park Press, an imprint of [[Haworth Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Gay-disabled-and-with-a-lot-to-talk-about-2788997.php |title=Gay, disabled and with a lot to talk about |publisher=''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-01 |first=Heidi |last=Benson |date=2004-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The ''Disability Studies Quarterly'', the publication of the [[Society for Disability Studies]], wrote a review of ''Queer Crips'', stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While Queer Crips can definitely boast of well-crafted, gorgeous poetry, there are a few exceptions. Perhaps it is only a matter of taste, but some of the poetry is of the cathartic type without the "craft" elements of formal published poetry or the spectacle of a performance piece. However, what is great about including such poetry is that it elevates all expressions of feeling and, in a sense, truly captures the sharing of the soul that poetry is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/518/695 |title=BOOK &amp; FILM REVIEWS |publisher=''[[Society for Disability Studies|Disability Studies Quarterly]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the book ''Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability'', [[Robert McRuer]] notes that the stories in ''Queer Crips'' are "nonheteronormative in their broadest sense" and that it is "striking how much the convergence of disability and homosexuality in "Queer Crips" appears to authorize erotic inventiveness and play". McRuer further writes that the anthology implicitly draws a parallel between [[compulsory heterosexuality]] and "compulsory able-bodiedness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability|last= McRuer|first= Robert|authorlink= |year= 2006|publisher= [[New York University Press]]|location= [[New York City]]|isbn= 0-814-75712-X|page= |pages= 243–4|accessdate=October 1, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cdNb_XJrPwwC&amp;pg=PA243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Right and Left''''' is a 1909 oil on canvas painting by the American artist [[Winslow Homer]]. It depicts a pair of [[common goldeneye]] ducks at the moment they are hit by a hunter's shotgun blast as they attempt to take flight. Completed less than two years before his death, it was Homer's last great painting,&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;Cikovsky, 374&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the subject of a variety of interpretations regarding its origin, composition and meaning. As with his other late masterworks, it represents a return to the sporting and hunting subjects of Homer's earlier years, and was to be his final engagement with the theme. Its design recalls that of [[Japanese art]], and the composition resembles that of a colored engraving by [[John James Audubon]].

==Background==
In May 1908 Homer suffered temporary impairment of his speech and muscular control as the effects of a mild stroke; on June 4 he wrote his brother Charles that "I can paint as well as ever. I think my pictures better for having one eye in the pot and one eye up a chimney— a new departure in the art world."&lt;ref&gt;Cikovsky, 405&lt;/ref&gt; By July 18 he was able to write that he had regained his abilities with the exception of tying "my neck tie in the way that I have done for the past 20 years....Every four or five days I try to do it but....it has been of no use."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, 238-239&lt;/ref&gt; Although he never completely recovered, Homer was well enough to attempt a major work, and it is probably ''Right and Left'' that he referred to in a letter to his brother Charles dated December 8, 1908: "I am painting when it is light enough on a most surprising picture".&lt;ref name="C5"&gt;Cikovsky, 375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cikovsky, 406&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:A Good Shot by Winslow Homer, 1892.png|thumb|left|Winslow Homer. ''A Good Shot, Adirondacks'', 1892. Watercolor. National Gallery of Art. With the hunter a distant element and the stricken animal placed in the foreground, this watercolor anticipates the composition of ''Right and Left''.&lt;ref name="CO"&gt;Cooper, 184&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Homer's biographers offer varying accounts of the events surrounding both the painting's conception and initial development. Homer's first biographer, William Howe Downes, wrote that the ducks used for the painting had been purchased by the artist for his Thanksgiving dinner; he so admired their [[plumage]] that he painted them instead.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 388&lt;/ref&gt; Homer's nephew told another of Homer's biographers, Philip Beam, that a friend of the artist named Phineas W. Sprague shot the birds in [[Prouts Neck]] that autumn and hung them on Homer's studio door, and the arrangement inspired the painting's design.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 388&lt;/ref&gt; Given the goldeneye's taste— Audubon called the duck "fishy, and in my opinion unfit for being eaten"— insofar as the implication is that the ducks were intended for food, neither story is altogether credible.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 388&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Likewise there are different versions regarding Homer's preparatory methods. Downes recounted that Homer took to sea in a boat, accompanied by a man with a [[double-barreled shotgun]], and studied the movements of birds as they were shot.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 388&lt;/ref&gt; In Beam's telling, Homer stood atop a cliff at [[Prouts Neck, Maine|Prouts Neck]] while his neighbor [[William Googins|Will Googins]], fired blank charges in his direction from a rowboat offshore.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 388&lt;/ref&gt; However, Homer was already familiar with this angle of shotgun blast, having in 1864 painted ''Defiance'', a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] subject of a soldier being shot at, and in 1892 ''A Good Shot, Adirondacks'', which shows the puff of distant rifle smoke and a mortally wounded deer hit in the foreground;&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 388&lt;/ref&gt; the latter especially anticipates the composition and intent of ''Right and Left''.&lt;ref name="CO"&gt;Cooper, 184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
For its "restrained color and extraordinary composition" the painting's debt to Japanese art has been noted by art historians.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;Cikovsky, 374&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, 206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 389&lt;/ref&gt; It has been compared to avian subjects by [[Okyo Maruyama]], [[Hiroshige]], and [[Hokusai]], and was included in a major ''[[Japonisme]]'' exhibition in Paris in 1988.&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 389&lt;/ref&gt; As well, it resembles John James Audubon's plate ''Golden-Eye Duck''.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;Cikovsky, 374&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:342 Golden-Eye Duck.jpg|thumb|[[John James Audubon]], ''Golden-Eye Duck'']]

Against the tradition of birds painted as dead [[still life]] objects, ''Right and Left'' is unique for its depiction of the very moment of death.&lt;ref name="L"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/great-works/homer-winslow-right-and-left-1907-744413.html Lubbock]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their rapid movement, the birds are seen as if frozen in a snapshot, and the viewer is literally afforded a bird's eye view, in the line of the hunter's fire.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt; Though the painting represents violent action, its formal aesthetic is that of sharply focused detachment,&lt;ref name="L"/&gt; and has been described by Nicolai Cikovsky, Jr. of the [[National Gallery of Art]] as "a staggeringly beautiful and almost oriental arrangement of birds--just abstract shapes against bands of the subtlest cream and grey".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/collection/rightandleft.shtm National Gallery of Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105050836/http://www.nga.gov/collection/rightandleft.shtm |date=2010-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design consists of four horizontal bands of sea and sky which are connected by a series of vertical and diagonal shapes formed by the ducks' bodies— the one at left (male) struggling to ascend, its partner in a similar position but turned 90 degrees, already falling limp— and wave crests.&lt;ref name="COO"&gt;Cooke, 118&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the birds' webbed feet and beaks and the boat's bow repeat the jagged contours of the waves.&lt;ref name="COO"&gt;Cooke, 118&lt;/ref&gt; Half hidden, the hunters occupy an ambiguous position, and it is uncertain whether the line above them denotes the horizon or a fog bank.&lt;ref name="COO"&gt;Cooke, 118&lt;/ref&gt; Atop this line is the rim of the sun, depicted as a red sliver.&lt;ref name="COO"&gt;Cooke, 118&lt;/ref&gt; At the right is a stray feather which "serves as an exclamation point for the whole composition."&lt;ref name="COO"&gt;Cooke, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was received by [[Knoedler|Knoedler &amp; Co.]] gallery in New York by January 30, 1909, and was described by the gallery as ''The Golden Eye or Whistler Duck''.&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 389&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Downes the painting was initially exhibited without Homer's having titled it, and received its name from a hunter who shouted appreciatively "Right and left!", the term for a rifleman's accomplishment in taking down two birds in quick succession with a double-barreled shotgun.&lt;ref name="C2"&gt;Cikovsky, 388&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=39763&amp;detail=none National Gallery of Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110062726/http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=39763&amp;detail=none |date=2010-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon viewing the painting in New York, its first owner, Randal Morgan, asked several questions regarding Homer's intent: he inquired as to the direction of the largest wave, and the cause of the disturbance in the water at the front of the picture, which he believed was the impetus for the ducks' movement to leave their feeding.&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 389&lt;/ref&gt; The questions were forwarded to the artist, but his reply is unknown. On August 3, 1909 Morgan bought the painting for $5,000, $4,000 of which went to Homer.&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 389&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
Although it is a painting of a sporting subject, and thus was part of a popular anecdotal tradition, given both the violence of the subject and the fact that it was painted the year before Homer's death, ''Right and Left'' has invited metaphysical interpretation.&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 389&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cikovsky, 374-375&lt;/ref&gt; For art historian [[John Wilmerding]], the painting embodied "a sense of the momentary and the universal, mortality illuminated by showing these creatures at the juncture of life and death".&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Cikovsky, 389&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the summation of Homer's sporting pictures, and presents its subject with an "almost testamentary finality".&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;Cikovsky, 374&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has also been suggested that in addition to summarizing interests that were lifelong for Homer, as well as referring to the works of previous artists, a modern and ironic meaning may have been intended as well: in 1908 air travel was a novel and transforming human achievement, one fraught with the adventure and danger of flight.&lt;ref name="C5"&gt;Cikovsky, 375&lt;/ref&gt; Considering his worldly and pictorial intelligence, it is possible that Homer intended ''Right and Left'' as an oblique reference to this aspect of modern life.&lt;ref name="C5"&gt;Cikovsky, 375&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30934">The '''Hermitage of San Baudelio de Berlanga''' (''Ermita de San Baudelio de Berlanga'') is an early 11th-century church at [[Caltojar]] in the [[Soria (province)|province of Soria]], [[Castile and León]], Spain, 80&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Berlanga de Duero]].  It is an important example of [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic]] architecture for its peculiarities, and was built in the 11th century, in what was then the frontier between [[Islam]]ic and [[Christian]] lands.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/07/eusi/ho_61.219.htm|title=Wall Painting of a Camel [From the hermitage of San Baudelio de Berlanga] (61.219) – Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History – The Metropolitan Museum of Art|work=metmuseum.org|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is dedicated to [[Baudilus|Saint Baudilus]] or Baudel.[[File:San Baudelio Frontal.jpg|thumb|273x273px|Frontal view of San Baudelio de Berlanga.]]

The construction of the hermitage is part of the period of the definitive consolidation of the Christian kingdoms throughout this area, which takes place around the year 1060, when the taking takes place, by [[Ferdinand I of León]], of several towns including Berlanga.

== History ==
Declared a national monument in 1917, The Hermitage of San Baudelio de Berlanga is thought to have been built to honor [[Baudilus|Saint Baudilus]], or San Baudelio as he is known in Spanish. Saint Baudilus was a monk who lived during the second or third century in [[Nîmes]] and is mentioned in two twelfth-century documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frinta|first=Mojmir S.|date=1964|title=The Frescoes from San Baudelio De Berlanga|url=|journal=Gesta 1/2|doi=10.2307/766616|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legends about Saint Baudilus say that he earned the crown of [[martyr]]dom after preaching the gospel to local townspeople celebrating the birth of Jupiter, and that after his execution by decapitation with an axe, wells sprang up at the location of his death. It is unknown what direct connection San Baudelio had with this [[chapel]] made in his honor, if any, though the movement of the cult of San Baudelio into [[Spain]] was probably responsible for its creation. Saint Baudilus died in the late third or [[4th century|fourth century]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Walter W. S.|date=1930-01-01|title=Romanesque Spanish Mural Painting (II) San Baudelio De Berlanga|jstor=3050760|journal=The Art Bulletin|volume=12|issue=1|pages=21–42|doi=10.2307/3050760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small adjoining [[cave]] is still accessible inside the southwestern wall of the [[sanctuary]], where a [[hermit]] may have lived at one point, and locals still make [[pilgrimage]] to a [[Spring (hydrology)|freshwater spring]] near the church each year on May 20 (his feast day) to pay respects to Saint Baudilus, who also had miraculous cures named after him in earlier centuries. An [[axe]] and a [[Arecaceae|palm tree]] are the symbols of his martyrdom, and the palm can be seen as a direct inspiration to the unique [[architecture]] of San Baudelio de Berlanga.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the tenth century as the power of the [[Moors]] was diminishing in the North, it is probable that a hermit monk took refuge in the lonely cave in the Spanish countryside. His status could have drawn visitors with offerings and companionship, which may have been the catalyst for the building of the hermitage church. At the approximate time of the building of the chapel, local craftsmen, mostly from [[Castile and León|Castile]], would have been [[Mozarabs]]. This would account for the heavy Mozarabic influence on the architecture. Also, San Baudelio closely correlates with a church pictured in the [[Codex Vigilanus]] (A. D. 976), approximating the construction of the hermitage to the late tenth or early eleventh century.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H.|first=C. H.|date=1928-01-01|title=Two Twelfth Century Frescoes from the Hermitage Church of San Baudelio de Berlanga, Spain|jstor=4170092|journal=Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts|volume=26|issue=153|pages=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most remarkable aspects is its pictorial decoration, as it is one of the important examples of Romanesque painting in Spain. Only a few remains of tempera painting remain, since the originals were torn and exported in 1926 to different museums of the [[United States]]. ([[Cincinnati Museum of Art]], [[The Cloisters|New York Cloisters Museum]], [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]). Some are also in the [[Prado Museum]], specifically six scenes.  Of the paintings that came out to United States we have: The Dromedary, The healing of the blind and The resurrection of Lazarus, The Temptation of Christ, The three Marys before the tomb, The Holy Supper, The wedding of Cana, Entrance to Jerusalem and the Falconer. In 1957 the Spanish government exchanged some of these paintings for [[the Fuentidueña Apse]] of the Romanesque church of San Martín of the Castilian town of [[Fuentidueña]], which today is preserved in the [[Metropolitan Museum of New York]], the paintings thus acquired were deposited in the Prado Museum. Among those found in Spain we have: Hunt deer, Hare hunting, The warrior, The elephant, The bear and The hunter. In 1965 the works of restoration of the paintings that were still in the church and that had not been removed were carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Prado Museum|title= Wall paintings of San Baudelio from Casillas de Berlanga (Soria) [anonymous Spanish]| url =https://www.museodelprado.es/aprende/enciclopedia/voz/pinturas-murales-de-san-baudelio-de-casillas-de/2d8a2b36-77b8-492d-880e-4274cb09d5ad

== Architecture and Construction ==
[[File:E San Baudelio de Berlanga PM 81370.jpg|left|thumb|Current view of the Central pillar of San Baudelio de Berlanga.]]
No records provide evidence of the construction of the church, but it is apparent that it belongs to the group of [[Mozarabs|Mozarabic]] churches built throughout northern Spain during the tenth and eleventh centuries. San Baudelio sets itself apart from the rest of the architecture in the [[Castile and León|Castile]] region because it is an uncommon example of the Mozarabic style, rather than the much more numerous examples of [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] influenced architecture from [[Andalusia]], which are found farther west in León.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The lack of information on the church force it to be dated based on its architectural influences and construction, as well as through the paintings that once lined the interior of the small chapel.

San Baudelio de Berlanga is a relatively plain building on the outside, being mostly square with a small, nearly square [[apse]] adjoining its east side. The walls of the entire structure are made of rough native stone, and its exterior offers no decoration whatsoever. The interior, however, is very distinctive, and has been described as “The most Mohammedan church in the whole of Spain.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:San Baudelio de Berlanga 22.JPG|thumb|Hollow lantern space with small oratory behind central pillar.]]
The entrance to San Baudelio de Berlanga is a single [[Horseshoe arch|horseshoe-arched]] door on the north wall of the building, which leads directly into the [[nave]] of the church. Upon entering the hermitage, visitors are greeted by a large circular [[Column|pillar]] that rises to the [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]] of the apse. From the top of the pillar  project eight ribbed arches, which are supported at the four corners and middle of the walls of the church. These arches are horseshoe forms with corner ribs supported by small Moorish inspired [[squinch]]es.

Similar to the [[Arecaceae|palm tree]], which symbolizes Saint Baudilus, it is not unlikely that this central column was designed by an [[architect]] to represent a palm tree, attribute of the Saint. Atop the pillar, in between the sprouting arches, is a small cavity, which is believed to be a place where treasures of the church or [[relic]]s of its saint were once secured. The interior of this space is ribbed in Moorish style, with crisscrossing arches around a [[dome]]d top, similar to the vaulted dome of the nearby hermitage of [[:es:Iglesia de San Miguel (Almazán)|San Miguel Almazan]].

Another unusual feature of San Baudelio de Berlanga is its [[Tribune (architecture)|gallery]], which spans the interior side of the west wall. This tribune is constructed of a double row of horseshoe arches, which support a [[Choir|choir area]] on the second floor, accessible by the stairs on the south wall. Projecting into the nave, and supported by the tribune, is a small [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]], which sits directly against the nave’s central pillar. This small chapel is [[barrel vault]]ed, and has a window on either of its sides. It is no larger than a [[pulpit]].[[File:San Baudelio de Berlanga 06.JPG|thumb|244x244px|Current view of a loophole window on east wall.|left]]The [[Apse|apsidal]] chapel, which joins the main building on its eastern side, is accessible through another horseshoe arched doorway, and sits four steps higher than the floor of the nave. At its back wall is a small loophole shaped window, which until it was closed off, would have allowed morning light to enter the chapel. This room is also barrel vaulted, and almost identical in size and shape to the chapel of the hermitage of San Cruz at Maderuelo.
One other unique aspect of San Baudelio de Berlanga is its connection to a small cave that lies under the hill on which the church sits. Access to this cave is gained through a doorway under the tribune, against the south wall. This is the cave in which a hermit may have lived at one time, possibly before the construction of the church.

The only natural means of light in the church would have been through the open doorway on the North wall, a now closed up window also found on the North wall, or a small window on the West wall that was converted from a doorway, which would have been an alternate entrance into the oratory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Elements of San Baudelio, like the double rows of [[Column|pillars]] and [[arch]]es, recall the stylistic elements of the [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|Great Mosque of Cordova]]. The ribbed arches, squinches or niches beneath the arches, and the method of construction in the lantern are all apparently derived from areas like [[Syria]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[Armenia]] in the Near East. It is important to note though, that not all the oriental aesthetics that occur in Spanish churches were introduced by the Moors. Many had already been introduced to Spain during [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] times through its commercial and ecclesiastical connections with the Near East.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The use of rectangular frames around arches and intersecting ribbed vaults at San Baudelio was originally inspired by the extension of the mosque of Cordoba by [[Al-Hakam II]], and it can also be seen in the church at [[Monasteries of San Millán de la Cogolla|San Millan de La Cogolla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T060103|title=Mozarabic|last=Torviso|first=I.G.

==Wall paintings==
The hermitage housed many fine [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[fresco]]es from about 1125; most of these have been removed, but some have remained.  Two sections, transferred to canvas, are now in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], showing the ''[[Entry of Christ into Jerusalem (Master of Taüll)|Entry of Christ into Jerusalem]]'' and the ''Wedding at Cana''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/entry-christ-jerusalem-master-san-baudelio-de-berlanga Indianapolis Museum of Art], page on ''Entry of Christ into Jerusalem''&lt;/ref&gt;  Other sections, including ''The Healing of the Blind Man and the Raising of Lazarus'' and ''The Temptation of Christ'' are in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/70012398 ''The Healing of the Blind Man and the Raising of Lazarus''] and [http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/70012461 ''The Temptation of Christ by the Devil''], MMA.  In all the MMA database has 9 paintings from the church, best found by searching on "Berlanga"&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Prado]].  The paintings were done by the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[Master of Tahull]] (Taüll in Catalan), whose best known works are in [[Sant Climent de Taüll]] and the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]] in [[Barcelona]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=76f61c324e73b8b233635aa5d988473fd1cbca3b64e9f3ce652e4abaab14bd20?inventoryNumber=015966-000&amp;lang=en|title=Apse of Sant Climent de Taüll – Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|work=mnac.cat|accessdate=27 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with two other painters. The scenes of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' are unusual in Spanish painting at this period; these are in American museums, while smaller elements including scenes of hunting and [[falconry]] and decorative copies of textiles are in [[Madrid]] as well as New York.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 261&lt;/ref&gt;  The frescoes include that of a [[camel]] and of a [[war elephant]], which were inspired by Muslim motifs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Originally every part of the church was covered with some kind of decoration. We can still see some of the remaining art work even though it has been eroded because of neglect or water seeping through the walls and loosening the plaster. Twenty-two compositions were removed from the church and brought to the United States and the [[Museo del Prado|Museo del Prado Madrid]]. Compared to other churches in [[Western Europe]] with painted interiors, San Baudelio is one of the best preserved from the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period. There are three main sections of decoration: the first two are [[narrative]]s and [[Secularity|secular]] [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]]; the large compositions from the vaults and the walls from the main body of the building; these have been largely removed. The third group, too damaged to be removed, are left inside the small oratory of the tribune.

Under the [[lunette]] of the apse, there are two figures sitting under arches: [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]] on the left of the window and Saint Baudilus at the right. We know it is Saint Baudilus because of the inscription BAVDILI(VS) even though some of the lower part of the image is missing. St. Nicholas is identified by the inscription (NICOL)AVS  and under him the words IN D€I NOMINE can be seen. St. Nicholas is depicted sitting on a pillowed chair with a luminous cloud or a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] surrounding him. Some of his features include [[tonsure]]d white hair and beard, an [[alb]], a red mantle over the alb, and sandals.  He is holding a [[Crosier|crozier]] in his left hand and his right palm is raised outward.  Both figures are placed against a striped background of what looks like faded teal green, pale red, forest green, yellow, and dark red. Under the window appears a long-legged, long necked bird, with a white body, and yellow and red wings. The [[ibis]] is painted against a dark red background, below it is inscribed: . . . E . . . AVLA DE(I).[[File:Raising Lazarus.jpg|left|thumb|Raising Lazarus. Now in The Cloisters Museum, New York.]]Around the [[17th century|seventeenth century]] the interior of the church was completely white washed due to the severe state of deterioration of the murals. But, a single piece was eventually found and transferred to canvas and it is still possible to identify the figure.

The north wall contains two scenes. They are separated by a tree, and the image on the right is better preserved. The image at the right of the tree appears to portray the meeting of [[Mary Magdalene]] and [[Jesus]] in the [[Gethsemane|garden]] after the [[resurrection]], it might also be the instance "she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus," or "Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, [[Rabbi|Rabboni]]; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father:" (John 20:17) Mary Magdalene is depicted with a halo surrounding her, white headdress and [[tunic]], and red mantle. Jesus is dressed in a long white tunic and brown mantle and carries a book in his left hand (presumably the bible.) Of the image at the left of the tree only a single female figure is preserved. Dressed in a long white tunic and orange mantle, the female shrinks backward in astonishment and observes a figure to the left. Of the figure on her left only a small piece of orange red cloth is preserved. There is nothing to indicate what scene it is other than the adjoining figures to the right of the tree; it might represent another encounter of the meeting of Jesus and Mary Magdalene in the garden.

The murals in the vaulting of the church are almost all gone. There are a few fragments left that contained scenes from the life of the Christ and the Virgin: [[Adoration of the Magi|The Adoration of the Magi]], [[Adoration of the Shepherds]], [[Circumcision]], [[Flight into Egypt|The flight into Egypt]], and probably the [[Annunciation]] and [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Presentation]] in the Temple.

On the south wall are some scenes of Jesus’s [[miracle]]s. One of these depicts him healing the blind man. Jesus, shown with short red hair and a beard, a large cross, and a halo surrounding him.  He wears an orange tunic and a blue mantle. He touches the eyes of the blind man that kneels before him. The blind man is wearing a long white tunic, red hose, and has short dark hair. His blindness is symbolized by closed eyes.
[[File:San baudelio de berlanga-cana.jpg|left|thumb|The Wedding at Cana. Now in Indianapolis.]]
Also appearing in the same space as the blind man is the [[Lazarus of Bethany|Resurrection of Lazarus]], one of the best preserved of the series.  Lazarus, is shown wrapped up like a [[mummy]] and placed in a black [[sarcophagus]]. Two seemingly holy women lift one end of the cover. Jesus touches the body of Lazarus with a long staff, which turns into a cross, and he is joined by a beardless figure with red hair, possibly [[John the Evangelist|St. John]], who is holding a green book in his left hand. Jesus is shown with a yellow-crossed nimbus, red hair, and pointed beard, and he wears an orange tunic with wide sleeves under a green mantle. The disciple at the left, also depicted with red hair, is wearing a long grey tunic and dark blue mantle. Both the women have halos and they wear pale green-orange headdresses that fall over the shoulders. The background is divided by wide stripes of dark blue, violet, red, and green.

The next miracle, the [[Marriage at Cana]], takes up half the space on the left on the west wall. The composition is disrupted by a doorway and is sectioned by a column. Jesus, the bridegroom and bride are seated at the feast. The table is shown covered with a white cloth and has circular loaves of bread and bowls of fruit. Jesus, at the left, is holding a knife in his left hand and blesses with his right hand.  As in the previous scene, Jesus is depicted with nimbus and dark red hair and beard, and is dressed in a long red tunic and dark blue mantle. The bearded bridegroom, who is holding a knife in his right hand and lifts his left hand in a gesture of speech, wears a tall hat, pale green tunic with an orange lining, brown mantle, light brown hose, and red sandals. The bride, who is seated at the right, is dressed in an orange headdress, a pale green robe with wide sleeves, and raises her right hand with her palm turned outward.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Hunting with Crossbow.jpg|thumb|137x137px|Hunting with a crossbow. Remain inside the hermitage.]]The remaining piece of the west wall contains a portrayal of the [[Temptation of Christ|Temptation of Christ in the Wilderness]], and in this scene he appears twice. At the left he is shown at the moment when [[Satan]] states "If thou be the [[Son of God]], command that these stones be made bread." The devil, depicted with long horns, wings, and a human body with claw feet, drops three large stones to the ground. Jesus, wearing a long orange tunic and dark blue mantle, holds up his left hand with palm outward in a sign of refusal. In the following scene Jesus is portrayed on a [[pinnacle]] of the temple. Here the devil is shown with human feet, wings, and a bearded animal-like head with long locks. Jesus is dressed as before and the temple is symbolized by a small building with circular windows and a [[gable]] roof. On the right, one of the angels who came to minister unto him speaks with a third demon, who appears to be half animal and half human. The body of the last devil is yellow and he has long hair and a pointed beard. The ugliness of the demons strike a sharp contrast to the poetic portrayal of the figure of Jesus.[[File:Ermta S Baudelio Casillas de Berlanga f.jpg|thumb|Bovine. Remain inside the hermitage.]]The sequence of Christ’s [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] starts at the north wall with Christ’s entrance into [[Jerusalem]]. Jerusalem is symbolized at the right by a structure with an open door. Above are [[Battlement|crenelated]] walls with windows. Outside awaiting Christ are two boys in red and blue tunics holding olive branches in their hands. Jesus rides on the donkey side-saddle in eastern fashion, approaching from the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jesus-story.net/painting_entry.htm|title=JESUS: ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM|website=www.jesus-story.net|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a halo with a cross, red hair, and beard, a teal tunic and a dark blue mantle. With his right hand he blesses as he holds a palm branch in his left hand. A baby horse accompanies the donkey Jesus is riding. Behind him follow the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]]. We can see seven full Apostles with [[Saint Peter|Peter]], who is depicted here with white hair and a beard, leading the group. The red-headed St. John follows him.[[File:A Spearman.jpg|thumb|339x339px|The Warrior of San Baudelio. Remain inside the hermitage.]]The [[Last Supper]] fills the rest of the north wall. Jesus is seated behind a table with a white cloth in the center of the composition. Many of the disciples are depicted holding knives and raising their hands as if to ask “is it me Lord?” when Jesus says “One of you will betray me.” We see St. John at Jesus’s bosom and Judas in the front of the composition. The food they are eating seem to be loaves and fish with Judas touching the fish in a bowl. As is customary, St. Peter is featured with a white beard and balding. St. Paul is also portrayed with white hair and a pointed beard, even though he was not one of the original disciples.

The [[Crucifixion]] itself appears to be missing from the walls of San Baudelio so it may have eroded with time. Logically it should follow after The Last Supper. It may well be that the Crucifixion was on the east wall near the Roman soldiers, since the Bible does mention them near the cross at the time of the crucifixion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2027:54|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 27:54 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:A Horseman Hunting.jpg|left|thumb|A Horseman Hunting. Remain inside the hermitage.|165x165px]]The next surviving scene depicts the visit by the women to the tomb of Jesus early on Sunday. Originally this scene was on the left side of the south wall of the nave but was removed and currently is in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston Museum of Fine Arts]]. An angel with a green halo seems to be standing in front of the tomb itself so we do not see the stone rolled away as described in the bible. The guards stand, frightened, with bent knees, one covering his face as if to shield himself from the blinding light of the angel. At the very right of the composition, the three women approach wearing halos and holding large vases with [[Topical medication|ointment]]. An Angel is depicted wearing an orange headdress with a greenish mantle, as the three Maries approach from the right.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;[[File:A Falconer.jpg|left|thumb|180x180px|A Falconer. Remain inside the hermitage.]]It seems originally that all four walls of the nave had eight large compositions, containing the life and passion of the Christ. It is highly possible at least four scenes may have included the [[Emmaus|Journey to Emmaus]], [[Doubting Thomas]], the [[Pentecost|Descent of the Holy Spirit]] on the side walls of the apse. Ideally the series would have concluded with the image of the enthroned Savior of the [[Last Judgment]]. It would have probably been similar to the apse of Saint Martin de Fenouillar with the Savior surrounded by the twelve evangelists (including Paul) and the twenty-four elders of [[Revelation]].[[File:Elephant and Castle (Fresco in San Baudelio, Spain).jpg|thumb|Elephant carrying a castle. Now in [[Museo del Prado]].|left|200x200px]]

==== Secular Frescoes ====
On the lower west wall of the Church is the scene of a wounded [[deer]] as it flees the hunter aiming at him with the loaded crossbow. The hunting of this animal is a subject very much in conformity with the iconography from ancient times and the Middle Ages. For the [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]], the deer had a symbolic character of abstaining of the evil of the world. In Christian culture, this icon represents the soul. The deer is also associated with [[Christ]] triumphing over the [[Satan|dragon]], making it the metaphorical claim a hunt for souls.

Next to the wounded deer on the right is a hunter riding a [[horse]], helped by three [[dog]]s chasing [[hare]]s, which end up trapped in the forest. The hare is a symbol in Christian iconography of the fragility of the soul and strong sexual desire or lust, which must be harassed and overcome.[[File:The Camel.jpg|thumb|264x264px|Camel, now in [[The Cloisters]], New York]]Continuing to the right on the north wall is a Falconer. [[Falconry]] was considered, both in Islam and the Christian Middle Ages as one of the noblest of hunting. The falconer, exhibiting his noble [[Bird of prey|raptor]], stands in a victorious posture like a [[knight]] triumphing, with the help of faith (the Falcon), over corrupt and evil animals like hares.

Located on the north tribune of the Church, is what looks to be a [[warrior]] carrying a spear and a shield. To the right of the warrior is what looks like an [[elephant]].  The symbol of humility, the elephant is associated with the figure of Christ, who became the smallest and most obedient of humans to prevent his own death. The elephant of San Baudelio carries on its back a [[castle]], allegory of diseases and miseries that have to be borne in the course of earthly life and the weight of the sins of existence. Next to the elephant is a bear. The bear is sometimes associated with the sin of gluttony and the unknown of the caves he inhabits. Perhaps the warrior who shares the stage with him, can vanquish him.

Behind the warrior on the opposite side of the tribune a [[camel]] is depicted, an exotic animal, well known in the ancient world for their roles in the war, transport and the circus. The camel is associated with Early Christian art along with the [[Magi]] and other biblical stories. Judging by this camel’s deformations, the artist of San Baudelio did not know what a camel looked like. To the left of the camel, vegetation appears as ornaments as well as textile patterns. They are arranged in circles, organized in rows, starting with the smaller ones. On the wall near the central pillar are two [[greyhound]]s. On the east wall at the start of the staircase there is a two faced [[Bovinae|bovine]].

There is debate as to the origin of the paintings.

It is believed that the frescos were painted at the same time by two different painters. An older painter and a younger painter.  The apse painted by the Master of Baudelio would have been painted first, after the entire mural scheme had been decided. Assembling the pictorial program required painters to collect images into sections within the church structure and into registers along the wall. Although at San Baudelio the registers were painted at the same time, certainly the lower zone would have been painted first. Perhaps living under the [[Muslim]] regime longer, accounts for the [[Moors|Moorish]] influence on the older painter’s use of Islamic themes. The younger painter might have been more versed in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] Christian iconography, possibly, because San Baudelio was in the wilderness between the Christian and Muslim border. Also, those of San Baudelio is similar to the fresco found in the found in The Church of The Vera Cruz De Maderuelo ([[Segovia]]).

'''''Shirley Temple, The Youngest, Most Sacred Monster of the Cinema in Her Time''''' (or '''''Shirley Temple, The Youngest, Most Sacred Monster of Contemporary Cinema'''''), also known as the '''''Barcelona Sphinx''''',&lt;ref name="Dali-catalog"&gt; [http://cataleg.salvador-dali.org/cataleg-2/eng/ffitxa.php?num=509&amp;img=0&amp;lletra=0&amp;pos=467 Dali catalogue] (accessed 1 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1939 artwork in [[gouache]], [[pastel]] and [[collage]] on cardboard, by [[surrealist]] painter [[Salvador Dalí]]. It measures 75 cm x 100 cm (29.5 inches x 39.5 inches). It is housed in [[the Netherlands]], at [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]], [[Rotterdam]]'s principal art gallery. 

The painting depicts the [[child actor|child star]] [[Shirley Temple]] as a [[sphinx]]. Shirley Temple's head, taken from a newspaper photograph, is superimposed on the body of a red [[lion|lioness]] with breasts and white claws. On top of the head is a vampire bat. Surrounding the sphinx are a human skull and other bones, suggesting her latest kill. At the bottom of the painting is a [[trompe-l'œil]] label that reads: "Shirley!. at last in Technicolor."&lt;ref name = "Tate"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue3/salvadordali.htm ''Salvador Dalí - the first pop star of painting''] [[Tate]] (accessed 1 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The painting has been described as a satire on the [[sexualization]] of child stars by Hollywood.&lt;ref name = "Lawson"&gt; [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,2092949,00.html ''Most sacred monsters''] [[Mark Lawson]], [[The Guardian]], 1 June 2007 (accessed 1 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCLA"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100707061731/http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/women/creed/creed1.html Baby Bitches From Hell: Monstrous-Little Women in Film] [[UCLA]] (accessed via Internet Archive 11 Feb 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was first shown at an exhibition held at the [[Julien Levy Gallery]], New York, from March 21 to April 18, 1939 (although the exhibition catalogue does not mention the painting, an article in the ''New York Times'' mentions its presence).&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=

{{Patent law}}

Legal scholars, economists, activists, policymakers, industries, and trade organizations have held differing views on patents and engaged in contentious debates on the subject. Critical perspectives emerged in the nineteenth century that were especially based on the principles of [[free trade]].&lt;ref name=Johns&gt;Johns, Adrian: ''Piracy.

The University of Chicago Press, 2009, {{ISBN|9780226401188}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|262–263}}  Contemporary criticisms have echoed those arguments, claiming that patents block innovation and waste resources that could otherwise be used productively,&lt;ref name='boldrin'&gt;{{Cite book| last = Levine | first = David | authorlink = David K.

(2001) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11401589 Worldwide Interest in Global Access to Drugs] Journal of the American Medical Association 285 (22): 2844–46&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatives to patents have been proposed, such [[Joseph Stiglitz]]'s suggestion of [[Prizes as an alternative to patents|providing "prize money"]] (from a "prize fund" sponsored by the government) as a substitute for the lost profits associated with abstaining from the monopoly given by a patent.&lt;ref name=Stiglitz&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph. Project Syndicate, 2007. [http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stiglitz81/English project-syndicate.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

These debates are part of a larger discourse on [[societal views on intellectual property|intellectual property protection]] which also reflects differing perspectives on [[anti-copyright|copyright]].

==History==
Criticism of patents reached an early peak in Victorian Britain between 1850 and 1880, in a campaign against patenting that expanded to target [[copyright]] too and, in the judgment of historian Adrian Johns, "remains to this day the strongest [campaign] ever undertaken against intellectual property", coming close to abolishing patents.&lt;ref name=Johns/&gt;{{rp|247}} Its most prominent activists - [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], [[William Robert Grove]], [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|William Armstrong]] and [[Robert Andrew Macfie|Robert A. MacFie]] - were inventors and entrepreneurs, and it was also supported by radical [[laissez-faire]] economists ([[The Economist]] published anti-patent views), law scholars, scientists (who were concerned that patents were obstructing research) and manufacturers.&lt;ref name=Johns/&gt;{{rp|249, 267, 270}}  Johns summarizes some of their main arguments as follows:&lt;ref name=Johns/&gt;{{rp|273}}&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Grove: ''Suggestions for Improvements in the Administration of the Patent Law'', [[The Jurist]] n.s. 6 (January 28, 1860) 19-25 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=BWlMAAAAYAAJ online copy] at Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Sherman, L. Bently: ''The Making of Modern Intellectual Property Law'' (CUP 1999), 50-56 {{ISBN|9780521057134}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''[Patents] projected an artificial idol of the single inventor, radically denigrated the role of the intellectual commons, and blocked a path to this commons for other citizens — citizens who were all, on this account, potential inventors too. [...] Patentees were the equivalent of squatters on public land — or better, of uncouth market traders who planted their barrows in the middle of the highway and barred the way of the people.''
Similar debates took place during that time in other European countries such as France, [[Prussia]], Switzerland and the Netherlands (but not in the USA).&lt;ref name=Johns/&gt;{{rp|248}}

Based on the criticism of patents as state-granted monopolies inconsistent with [[free trade]], the [[Netherlands]] abolished patents in 1869 (having established them in 1817), and did not reintroduce them until 1912.&lt;ref name="kick"&gt;[[Ha Joon Chang|Chang, Ha-Joon]]. [http://www.paecon.net/PAEtexts/Chang1.htm "Kicking Away the Ladder: How the Economic and Intellectual Histories of Capitalism Have Been Re-Written to Justify Neo-Liberal Capitalism"]. ''[[Post-Autistic Economics Review]]''. 4 September 2002: Issue 15, Article 3. Retrieved on 8 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In Switzerland, criticism of patents delayed the introduction of patent laws until 1907.&lt;ref name=Johns/&gt;{{rp|248}}&lt;ref name="kick"/&gt;

==Contemporary arguments==
Contemporary arguments have focused on ways that patents can slow innovation by: blocking researchers' and companies' access to basic, enabling technology, and particularly following the explosion of patent filings in the 1990s, through the creation of "patent thickets"; wasting productive time and resources fending off enforcement of low-quality patents that should not have existed, particularly by "patent trolls"; and wasting money on patent litigation.  Patents on pharmaceuticals have been a particular focus of criticism, as the high prices they enable puts life-saving drugs out of reach of many people.

===Blocking innovation===
The most general argument against patents is that "intellectual property" in all its forms represents an effort to claim something that should not be owned, and harms society by slowing innovation and wasting resources.&lt;ref name='boldrin'/&gt;

Law professors [[Michael Heller (law professor)|Michael Heller]] and Rebecca Sue Eisenberg have described an ongoing [[tragedy of the anticommons]] with regard to the proliferation of patents in the field of [[biotechnology]], wherein  intellectual property rights have become so fragmented that, effectively, no one can take advantage of them as to do so would require an agreement between the owners of all of the fragments.&lt;ref name=anticommons/&gt;

Some public campaigns for improving access to medicines and [[genetically modified food]] have expressed a concern for "preventing the over-reach" of intellectual property protection including patent protection, and "to retain a public balance in property rights".&lt;ref name=sksell&gt;Susan K Sell (2003), ''Private Power, Public Law: The Globalization of Intellectual Property Rights'', Cambridge, 2003 Cambridge University Press: [http://www.international-ul.com/pdf/ebook/1/_Uyz13PfFMbDE.pdf Cambridge Studies in International Relations: 88]; quoted from page 179, see also page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QjSOfWPo6V4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=genetically&amp;f=false | title = Intellectual Property Rights and the Life Science Industries: A Twentieth Century History | isbn = 9780754621119 | author1 = Dutfield | first1 = Graham | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some economists&lt;ref name='boldrin'/&gt; and scientists&lt;ref name="Pearce J. M. 519–521"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pearce J.

Others claim that patents have had no effect on research, based on surveys of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook |first=Robert |url=http://www.thehastingscenter.org/Publications/BriefingBook/Detail.aspx?id=2174 |title=Gene Patents |publisher=The Hastings Center |date= |accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceprogress.org/2009/10/do-gene-patents-hurt-research/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404034653/http://www.scienceprogress.org/2009/10/do-gene-patents-hurt-research/ |archivedate=2011-04-04 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor patent quality and patent trolls===
Patents have also been criticized for being granted on already-known inventions, with some complaining in the United States that the USPTO fails "to do a serious job of examining patents, thus allowing bad patents to slip through the system."&lt;ref name="lemley"&gt;Lemley, Mark A., Rational Ignorance at the Patent Office (February 2001). Northwestern University Law Review, Vol. 95, No. 4, 2001. {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.261400}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, some argue that because of low number of patents going into litigation, increasing quality of patents at [[patent prosecution]] stage increases overall legal costs associated with patents, and that current USPTO policy is a reasonable compromise between full trial on examination stage on one hand, and pure registration without examination, on the other hand.&lt;ref name="lemley"/&gt;

Enforcement of patents – especially patents perceived as being overly broad – by [[patent trolls]], has brought criticism of the patent system,&lt;ref name=Barker/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |last1=Blumberg |first1=Alex |last2=Sydell |first2=Laura |url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/496/when-patents-attack-part-two |title=When Patents Attack... Part Two! |website=This American Life |publisher=Chicago Public Media |date=May 31, 2013 |accessdate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some commentators suggest that patent trolls are not bad for the patent system at all but instead realign market participant incentives, make patents more liquid, and clear the patent market.&lt;ref&gt;James F. McDonough III (2006) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=959945&amp;rec=1&amp;srcabs=980776 The Myth of the Patent Troll] accessed 2010-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Some patents granted in Russia have been denounced as [[pseudoscientific]] (for example, health-related patents using lunar phase or religious icons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Litigation costs===
According to [[James Bessen]], the costs of patent litigation exceed their investment value in all industries except chemistry and pharmaceuticals. For example, in the software industry, litigation costs are twice the investment value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bessen James | year = 2008 | title = The value of U.S. patents by owner and patent characteristics | url = | journal = Research Policy | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 932–945 | doi=10.1016/j.respol.2008.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bessen and Meurer also note that software and business model litigation accounts for a disproportionate share (almost 40 percent) of patent litigation cost, and the poor performance of the patent system negatively affects these industries.&lt;ref name=BessenMeurer/&gt;&lt;ref name=WheelerAllworth&gt;Rob Wheeler and James Allworth for the Harvard Business Review.  Sept 15, 2011 [https://hbr.org/2011/09/the-america-invents-act-rearra U.S. Patent Overhaul Won’t Help Innovators]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Different industries but one law===
[[Richard Posner]] noted that the most controversial feature of US patent law is that it covers all industries in the same way, but not all industries benefit from the time-limited monopoly a patent provides in order to spur innovation.&lt;ref name=Posner/&gt;  He said that while the pharmaceutical industry is "poster child" for the need for a twenty-year monopoly, since costs to bring to a market are high, the time of development is often long, and the risks are high, in other industries like software the cost and risk of innovation is much lower and the cycle of innovation is quicker, and obtaining and enforcing patents and defending against patent litigation is generally a waste of resources in those industries.&lt;ref name=Posner/&gt;

===Pharmaceutical patents===
Some have raised ethical objections specifically with respect to pharmaceutical patents and the high prices for medication that they enable their proprietors to charge, which poor people in the developed world, and developing world, cannot afford.&lt;ref name="Banta, D.H. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferreira L. (2002) [http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3874&amp;context=flr&amp;sei-redir=1&amp; Access to Affordable HIV/AIDS Drugs: The Human Rights Obligations of Multinational Pharmaceutical Corporations] Fordham Law Review 71(3):1133–79&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also question the rationale that exclusive patent rights and the resulting high prices are required for pharmaceutical companies to recoup the large investments needed for research and development.&lt;ref name="Banta, D.H. 2001"/&gt; One study concluded that marketing expenditures for new drugs often doubled the amount that was allocated for research and development.&lt;ref&gt;Barton J.H. and Emanuel, E.J.

In 2003, [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) reached an agreement, which provides a developing country with options for obtaining needed medications under [[compulsory licensing]] or importation of cheaper versions of the drugs, even before patent expiration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/pres03_e/pr350_e.htm Decision removes final patent obstacle to cheap drug imports]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the government of Brazil declared [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]]'s [[efavirenz]] anti-retroviral drug a "public interest" medicine, and challenged Merck to negotiate lower prices with the government or have Brazil strip the patent by issuing a compulsory license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newsrx.com/newsletters/Health-and-Medicine-Week/2004-08-02/080220043339965W.html | title = Drugs give HIV patients longer lives in victory for anti-patent activists| publisher =Health &amp; Medicine Week | date = August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5027532.stm | last = Anderson | first = Tatum | title = Africa rises to HIV drug challenge| publisher =BBC News |date=June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gay&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2007/05/03/6

It is reported that [[Ghana]], [[Tanzania]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] and [[Ethiopia]] have similar plans to produce generic antiviral drugs. [[Western world|Western]] pharmaceutical companies initially responded with legal challenges, but some have now promised to introduce alternative pricing structures for developing countries and NGOs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gay /&gt;

In July 2008 Nobel Prize-winning scientist Sir [[John Sulston]] called for an international biomedical treaty to clear up issues over patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7490384.stm | last = McGrath  | first = Matt  | title = Sulston argues for openmedicine| publisher =BBC News |date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these criticisms, one review concluded that less than 5 percent of medicines on the [[essential drugs|World Health Organization's list of essential drugs]] are under patent.&lt;ref name="PoIP"&gt;Ghafele R (2008) [http://www.ip-institute.org.uk/pdfs/Perceptions%20of%20IP.pdf Perceptions of Intellectual Property: A Review] London: Intellectual Property Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the pharmaceutical industry has contributed US$2 billion for healthcare in developing countries, providing HIV/AIDS drugs at lower cost or even free of charge in certain countries, and has used differential pricing and parallel imports to provide medication to the poor.&lt;ref name="PoIP" /&gt; Other groups are investigating how social inclusion and equitable distribution of research and development findings can be obtained within the existing intellectual property framework, although these efforts have received less exposure.&lt;ref name="PoIP" /&gt;

Quoting a [[World Health Organization]] report, Trevor Jones (director of research and development at the Wellcome Foundation, as of 2006) argued in 2006 that patent monopolies do not create [[monopoly pricing]]. He argued that the companies given monopolies "set prices largely on the willingness/ability to pay, also taking into account the country, disease and regulation" instead of receiving competition from legalized generics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

==Proposed alternatives to the patent system==
Alternatives have been discussed to address the issue of financial incentivization to replace patents. Mostly, they are related to some form of direct or indirect government funding. One example is [[Joseph Stiglitz]]'s idea of [[Prizes as an alternative to patents|providing "prize money"]] (from a "prize fund" sponsored by the government) as a substitute for the lost profits associated with abstaining from the monopoly given by a patent.&lt;ref name=Stiglitz/&gt; Another approach is to remove the issue of financing development from the private sphere altogether, and to cover the costs with direct government funding.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Dean.

'''''Still Life: Balsam Apple and Vegetables''''' is an early 19th century [[oil painting]] by American painter [[James Peale]]. Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts a number of vegetables set on a table. The work is currently on display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].
== Description ==
The painting is a [[still life]], created to allow for an accurate representation of a physical object on a painted canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wga.hu/html_m/p/peale/stillife.html|title=Still Life: Balsam Apples and Vegetables by PEALE, James|website=www.wga.hu|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's description of the work, the painting is possibly an "experimental exercise" created during the peak of Peale's career.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11734?sortBy=Relevance&amp;amp;high=on&amp;amp;od=on&amp;amp;ft=*&amp;amp;offset=160&amp;amp;rpp=100&amp;amp;pos=211|title=www.metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is noted as being similar to the Spanish School of still life painting due to its focus on vegetables.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Strettweger Opferwagen.JPG|right|thumb| Cult Wagon of Strettweg as depicted in 1886 Jahrbuch des Kaiserlich Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts.]]
[[File:Kultwagen von Strettweg - 2.jpg|thumb|detail]]
The '''Cult Wagon of Strettweg''', or '''Strettweg Sacrificial Wagon''', or '''Strettweg Chariot''' is a bronze cult wagon from ca. 600 [[Before Christ|BC]], which was found as part of a princely grave of the [[Hallstatt culture]] in Strettweg near [[Judenburg]], [[Austria]] in 1851.  Besides the wagon, other [[grave goods]], like jewelry, bronze [[amphorae]], iron weapons, and [[horse tack|tack]] and [[horse harness|harness]] gear were found.

The wagon consists of a square-shaped, open-worked base plate with four spoked wheels. A female figure approx. 32&amp;nbsp;cm high holding a bowl-shaped object in upraised hands stands in the center of the wagon.  The bowl is also held on the sides by two scissor-shaped supports.   Recent restoration work and examination by experts has concluded that the bowl attributed to the wagon up to now cannot be conclusively proven to originally have been part of the cult wagon {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.  In addition to the kettle bearer, numerous other figures in the form of both standing and mounted people as well as animals similar to deer and to horses are present on the wagon. The depicted scene is interpreted as a [[sacrifice]]. The wagon presumably served as a [[cult]] object for the consumption of a [[libation]].

The Strettweg Sacrificial Wagon was restored in 2009 and is on display in the newly redesigned Archaeology Museum of [[Styria|Styrian]] [[Universalmuseum Joanneum]] at [[Schloss Eggenberg (Graz)|Schloss Eggenberg]] in [[Graz]].  A copy is on display in the museum in Judenburg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5567">[[File:Lutoslawski Symphony 3 excerpt.JPG|thumb|400px|A page from the score of the symphony.]]
[[Witold Lutosławski]] wrote his '''Symphony No. 3''' in 1973–1983. The [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Georg Solti]], gave the world premiere on 29 September 1983. The work is dedicated to Solti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was awarded the Nagroda Solidarności in 1984 and selected for the first [[Grawemeyer Award]] for Music Composition in 1985.

==Instrumentation==
The Symphony calls for a large orchestra, consisting of:
*[[Woodwind instrument|Woodwind]]:  3 [[flute]]s (two doubling [[piccolo]]), 3 [[oboe]]s (third doubling [[cor anglais]]), 3 [[clarinet]]s (one doubling [[E-flat clarinet]], another doubling [[bass clarinet]]), 3 [[bassoon]]s (third doubling [[contrabassoon]])
*[[Brass instrument|Brass]]: 4 [[French horn|horns]], 4 [[trumpet]]s, 4 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]]
*[[Percussion instrument|Percussion]]:
**[[timpani]]
**4 additional [[percussion instrument|percussionists]] playing:  [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[marimba]], [[vibraphone]] (without motor), [[Tubular bell|bells]], five [[Tom-tom drum|tom-toms]], two [[Bongo drum|bongos]], [[bass drum]], [[Snare drum|side drum]], [[tenor drum]], three [[cymbal]]s (small, medium and large), [[Tamtam#Chau gongs|tam-tams]] (hign and low) and [[tambourine]]
*[[Keyboard instruments|Keyboards]]: [[celesta]], [[piano]] (four hands)
*[[String section|Strings]]: 2 [[harp]]s, first and second [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s and [[double bass|basses]]

==Analysis==
{{See also|Witold_Lutosławski#Aleatory_technique}}
{{original research|date=June 2011}}
Many passages in the Symphony no. 3 employ Lutosławski's by-then well developed technique which he called "[[aleatory music|limited aleatorism]]", in which the individual players in the orchestra are each asked to play their phrase or repeated fragment ''in their own time'' — rhythmically independent from the other musicians.  During these passages very little synchronisation is specified: events that are coordinated include the simultaneous entrances of groups of instruments, the abrupt end of some episodes, and some transitions to new sections.  By this method the composer retains control of the symphony's architecture and the realisation of the performance, while simultaneously creating complex and somewhat unpredictable polyphony.

At the beginning of the illustrated page from the score, for instance, the woodwinds and brass (notated at the top of the page) are playing short repeated passages.  The composer specifies completely the music for each player, leaving the interpretation to the individuals: only the co-ordination between the parts is unspecified.  The strings (notated at the bottom of the page) join the texture by sections: first the violins, then the violas, the cellos and lastly the basses, all playing rapid repeating figures.  The string players do not coordinate their playing (even within sections) except for their entries.  These entries are indicated by the conductor, as instructed by the down-arrows above the string parts.

Other parts of the symphony (the very beginning and the very end, for example) call for rhythmic synchronization of the orchestra, and are notated more traditionally.

The Society was essentially a commercial [[cooperative]], as opposed to a stylistic [[collective]], and its foundation contributed to the development of the tiny [[Taos art colony]] into an international art center.

[[Joseph Henry Sharp]], who decided to make painting of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] his life work, visited Taos on a trip through New Mexico in 1893.&lt;ref name=HMA-TSA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harwoodmuseum.org/collections/taos-society |title=Taos Society of Artists |work=Collections |publisher=Harwood Museum of Art |accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While there he became enchanted with the people of the [[Taos Pueblo]] and the landscape,&lt;ref name=James373&gt;James (1920), p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; an interest he shared with [[Ernest L. Blumenschein|Ernest Blumenschein]] when they were studying art in Paris.&lt;ref name=HMA-TSA/&gt;&lt;ref name=James373/&gt;   Having heard of the degree to which Sharp was interested in painting the [[western United States]], and the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] [[pueblo]] of Taos in particular, Blumenschein came to Taos with fellow artist [[Bert Geer Phillips|Bert Phillips]] in 1898.  Planning only to visit Taos, they became enamored by the Taos valley and its people that they decided to stay.  This was the beginning of the [[Taos art colony]].&lt;ref name=Blieler&gt;{{cite book | title=Taos | author=Bleiler, L; Society of the Muse of the Southwest | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | location=Charleston | year=2011 | page=75 | isbn=978-0-7385-7959-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9tLeh-G-kEC&amp;pg=PA75 |series=Images of America }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blumenschein described his first sights of Taos, "The month was September, and the fertile valley a beautiful sight, and inspiration for those who ply the brush for happiness.  The primitive people of this out-of-the-way region were harvesting their crops by sunlight and by moonlight.  Brown people they were, both [[Mexican people|Mexicans]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]], happy people with happy children, in a garden spot protected by mountains."  More compelling were the people.  Native Americans had lived for centuries in the pueblo just outside the village of Taos. There a peace-loving, [[democracy|democratic]] society has maintained, and continues to maintain, its history, culture, dress and way of life over centuries.&lt;ref name="James375-376"&gt;James (1920), pp. 375-376&lt;/ref&gt;

Ernest Blumenschein returned to [[New York City]] for a time while Phillips stayed behind.  Blumenschein kept up correspondence with Phillips and discussed setting up an artist colony in Taos.  Blumenschein also wrote other artists in New York and [[Paris]] of Taos about the "beauty and artistic promise of [[northern New Mexico]]."&lt;ref name=HMA-TSA/&gt;

On July 19, 1915 [[Joseph Henry Sharp]], [[E. Irving Couse]], [[Oscar E. Berninghaus]], [[W. Herbert Dunton]], [[Ernest L. Blumenschein|Ernest Blumenschein]] and [[Bert Geer Phillips|Bert Phillips]] formed the Taos Society of Artists.  The six founding members were known as the "Taos Six". [[E. Irving Couse]] was the Society's first president.&lt;ref name=Blieler/&gt;

Their work, defined the first several decades of the [[Taos art colony]], was distinguished by: Native Americans in traditional clothing, area [[Hispanic]]s and [[Anglo-American ethnic group|Anglo-Americans]] and landscapes.&lt;ref name=HMA-TSA/&gt;

The group's first exhibition was held at the [[Palace of the Governors]] in Santa Fe soon after their formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen-Solal|first1=Annie|title=Painting American : The Rise of American Artists, Paris 1867-New York 1948|date=2001|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0679450939|page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1917 they were sending [[Travelling exhibition|travelling exhibits]] of their work across the United States.  Initial critical reaction of the works was that they were unrealistic and overdone: vivid colors, too emotionally evocative and strong vibrational quality.  The artists questioned the critics veracity, since they had never been to the [[Southwestern United States|southwestern]] [[desert]], nor the [[Taos Pueblo]].&lt;ref name="James377-378"&gt;James (1020), pp. 377-378&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and membership==
Member artists had to have worked in Taos for three consecutive years, shown an interest and aptitude for painting Native Americans and have shown in reputable galleries or New York salons (ongoing art exhibits). The primary reason for the requirements was to ensure that the artists were well-intentioned and capable of capturing the character and spirit of the people.&lt;ref name="James376-377"&gt;James (1920), pp. 376-377&lt;/ref&gt;

Later members included [[Julius Rolshoven]], [[E. Martin Hennings]], [[Catharine Carter Critcher|Catharine C.

==Associate and honorary members==
Some artists from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], another developing arts center, were included as Associate members: [[Robert Henri]],  [[Albert L. Groll]], [[Randall Davey]], [[Bror Julius Olsson Nordfeldt|B.J.O. Nordfeldt]], [[Gustave Baumann]], Albert Groll, [[Birger Sandzén]],&lt;ref name=TAM-About/&gt; and [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]].&lt;ref name="Taos Daily"/&gt;
   
Honorary memberships were extended to men who helped create a museum infrastructure in New Mexico: [[Edgar L. Hewett]], the director of the [[Museum of New Mexico]]; and Frank Springer, whose donations helped to build the Museum of New Mexico’s [[New Mexico Museum of Art|Fine Arts Museum]] in Santa Fe.&lt;ref name="Taos Daily"/&gt;

==War work==
During [[World War I]], the Taos society artists served on United War Work Committees, designed posters and exhibited canvases at [[Red Cross]] bazars. Most notably they created "range-finder paintings", 50 by 100 foot landscapes of Belgium and France used as military teaching tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=RINDGE|first1=FRED HAMILTON|title=TAOS—A UNIQUE COLONY OF ARTISTS|journal=The American Magazine of Art|date=September 1926|volume=17|issue=9|page=452|jstor=23929280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these paintings were exhibited in the 1918 Taos Society of Artists' annual exhibition held at the [[Museum of New Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Robert R.|title=The Taos Society of Artists|date=1998|publisher=University of New Mexico|location=Albuquerque|isbn=0826319467|page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depression==
The [[Great Depression|depression]] was the precipitating factor for the dissolution of the Taos Society of Artists.  Taos was devastated by the depression and the artist's [[Patronage|patrons]] were not spending money on art during that time. Victor Higgins the most financially devastated by the Depression made two of his most important paintings during that time, ''Winter Funeral'' heralded by the New York press, and ''Sleeping Nude'' similarly praised by the Chicago Herald Examiner writer Inez Cunningham.  Cunningham likened Higgins to a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] rising out of the ashes, "what heights of intellectual and emotional fire.  He is one of those fortunate few who flower in maturity."&lt;ref name="TAM-About"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taosartmuseum.org/about.php |title=About |publisher=Taos Art Museum |accessdate=2011-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006060005/http://www.taosartmuseum.org/about.php |archivedate=2011-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The "Taos Six" applied academic technique to native themes to produce a uniquely American school of painting. Each artist's style was unique, though cross influence can certainly be noted as can strong elements of their [[Academic art|European Academic artistic training]]. Aside from the inspiration of their environment, one quality early [[Taos art colony]] paintings share is their vibrant palette of colors - not a common sight when paired with more traditional representational images and application of paint. Today, these artists are recognized for their contribution to artistic development and their scenes of Taos locales grace the walls of many museums.&lt;ref name="Taos Daily"&gt;Whaley, Bill; Stiny, Andy.

'''The Book of the White Earl''' is an [[Ireland|Irish]] religious and literary [[miscellany]] created c. 1404&amp;ndash;1452. 

''The Book of the White Earl'', now '''Bodleian Laud Misc. MS 610''', consists of twelve folios inserted into [[Leabhar na Rátha]], aka [[The Book of Pottlerath]]. It was created by [[Irish language|Gaelic]] [[scribes]] under the patronage of [[James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond]] (1392–1452). Henry and Marsh-Michel describe it as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"The sumptuous initials of this book are not more or less servile repetition of twelfth-century work ... the work of the scribe also is dazzling. He plays like a virtuoso with various sizes of script, the larger size having a majestic decorative quality. The contents are no less remarkable; the '[[Martyrology of Óengus]]', the '[[Acallam na Senórach]]' and a dindsenchus. The foliage pattern is probably inspired by foreign models, but is so completely integrated that the borrowing is only realised on second thoughts. The initials are large, bold, and drawn in firm lines and bright colours"''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Butler was known to have been strongly [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. He was an Irish-speaker and seems to have been the very first of the [[Anglo-Irish]] lords to appoint a [[brehon]], Domhnall Mac Flannachadha, for his service. Butler granted Mac Flannchadha lands in [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]].

'''''The Crossing of the Red Sea''''' is a painting by [[Nicolas Poussin]], produced between 1633 and 1634. It depicts the [[Crossing the Red Sea|crossing of the Red Sea]] by the Israelites, from chapter 14 of the [[book of Exodus]]. It was made as part of a pair of paintings (the other being ''[[The Adoration of the Golden Calf]]'') commissioned by Amadeo dal Pozzo, Marchese di Voghera of Turin, a cousin to [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]], Poussin's main sponsor in Rome. By 1685 the pair had passed to the Chevalier de Lorraine and in 1710 they were bought by Benigne de Ragois de Bretonvillers. 

In 1741 the pair was bought from Samuel by [[Jacob Bouverie, 1st Viscount Folkestone|Sir Jacob Bouverie]], whose son [[William Bouverie, 1st Earl of Radnor|William]] became the first [[Earl of Radnor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artfund.org/artwork/1532/the-adoration-of-the-golden-calf |title=The Adoration of the Golden Calf |publisher=Art Fund |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earls of Radnor owned the pair from then until 1945, when it was split for the first time and ''The Adoration of the Golden Calf'' was sold to the [[National Gallery]] in London. ''The Crossing of the Red Sea'' was acquired by [[Kenneth Clark]] for the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in 1948&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:56Gk4l8Y5aQJ:arthistoriography.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/anderson-on-burke.pdf+%22Crossing+of+the+Red+Sea%22+felton+1945&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESj9-tN92cMt1IYQFw8l5oUVNfaOoLdSD9mCkJkrkrIXqRzZ__hH5otEHoUOSefvNu43wXBW7rlQViazQ6thM0z1ttSSpXPdBQck_SEEsv5C4gU5KtP_TVPj_-n_qxuPfvAIL8EK&amp;sig=AHIEtbQAwvv9Z1hJ9gGYWhalpNmp2ZtV6w Poussin Paintings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/ngv-collection/search?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cubmd2LnZpYy5nb3YuYXUlMkZjb2xhcHAlMkZwdWIlMkZhcnR3b3JrcyUyRjQyNzElMkZkZXRhaWxzJmFsbD0x NGV catalogue entry]&lt;/ref&gt; using money from the [[Alfred Felton#Felton Bequest|Felton Bequest]], a fund originally left to the gallery in 1904 by the industrialist [[Alfred Felton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/01/11/1073769451690.html |title=The bequest of a century |publisher=www.theage.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 it underwent a major conservation project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/essay/the-poussin-project/ NGV conservation project on the painting]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Twentysix Gasoline Stations''''' is the first [[artist's book]] by the American [[Pop art|pop]] artist [[Ed Ruscha]]. Published in April 1963&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Edward Ruscha Editions, Engberg, Phillpot, Walker Art Center, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; on his own imprint National Excelsior Press,&lt;ref name="Edward Ruscha Editions p60"&gt;Edward Ruscha Editions, Engberg, Phillpot, Walker Art Center, 1999 Vol2 p60&lt;/ref&gt; it is often considered to be the first modern artist's book,&lt;ref name="Drucker"&gt;The Century of Artist's Books, Drucker, Granary, 2004 p11&lt;/ref&gt; and has become famous as a precursor and a major influence on the emerging artist's book culture, especially in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://printedmatter.org/catalogue/recs.cfm?list_id=224 Printed Matter website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928165456/http://printedmatter.org/catalogue/recs.cfm?list_id=224 |date=2008-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book delivers exactly what its title promises, reproducing 26 photographs of gasoline stations next to captions indicating their brand and location. From the first service station, 'Bob's Service' in [[Los Angeles]] where Ruscha lived, the book follows a journey back to [[Oklahoma City]] where he had grown up and where his mother still lived. The last image is of a [[Petrofina|Fina]] gasoline station in [[Groom, Texas|Groom]], [[Texas]], which Ruscha has suggested should be seen as the beginning of the return journey, 'like a coda'.&lt;ref&gt;'It was like going out in a certain direction and then backtracking...I wanted something to appear kind of awkward there, almost like a coda' Ruscha, 1963, quoted in ''Edward Ruscha Editions 1959-1999'', Walker Art Center, Vol 2 1999 p63&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally printed in a numbered edition of 400, a second edition of 500 was published in 1967 and a third of 3000 in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;''Twentysix Gasoline Stations'', Ed Ruscha, 3rd Edition, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of these later editions was numbered. It has been suggested that these reprints were a deliberate attempt to flood the market in order to maintain the book's status as a cheap, mass-produced commodity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://printedmatter.org/catalogue/recs.cfm?list_id=224 Cara Marsh Sheffler, The Late Edition: Twenty Years of Dissemination at Printed Matter (2005) essay reproduced on Printed Matter Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928165456/http://printedmatter.org/catalogue/recs.cfm?list_id=224 |date=2008-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book originally sold for $3.50.&lt;ref name="Edward Ruscha Editions p60"/&gt; Of the work, [[Johanna Drucker]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ruscha's books combined the literalness of early California pop art with a flat-footed photographic aesthetic informed by minimalist notions of repetitive sequence and seriality....Thirty years later, with a quarter of a century of mainstream artworld activity between, the aspect of shock-effect and humor has diminished somewhat. But in 1962 (sic) this work read against the photographic landscape of highly aestheticized image-making.&lt;ref&gt;''The Century of Artist's Books'', Drucker, Granary, 2004 p76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origins of ''Twentysix Gasoline Stations''==
Ruscha would drive home  to visit his parents in Oklahoma four or five times a year&lt;ref&gt;[http://thispublicaddress.com/tPA4/archives/2006/07/twentysix_gasoline_stations.html]&lt;/ref&gt; after leaving home at 18; many of the journeys were taken with his friend and fellow artist [[Joe Goode]]. Ruscha has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wasn't coming out here [California] to do anything in particular, or to be anything in particular except...except out of Oklahoma...a long way from Oklahoma, that's what I wanted to be, and everything it stood for. And away from the catholic church too, and Sister Daniella who beat my knuckles with a pencil the one year I was in parochial school.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Ruscha quoted in I Dont Want No Retro Spective, Hickey &amp; Plagens, Hudson Hills Press 1982, p26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ruscha had visited Europe in 1961, and been particularly taken by the books he saw for sale "on the street, in those little bookstalls," and been impressed by the "non-commercial look... a strange kind of sober design including the typography and the binding and everything."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Ruscha Editions, Engberg, Phillpot, Walker Art Center, 1999 p59&lt;/ref&gt; Back in Los Angeles, he conceived the idea initially as a play on words, deciding upon the title first, then working on the typography and design before taking the photographs.&lt;ref name="Artforum"&gt;Interview with Ed Ruscha, Artforum, Feb 1965, reprinted in ''Leave Any Information at the Signal'', Schwartz, October Books, 2002, p24-25&lt;/ref&gt; He took about 60 photographs, and edited them down to 26 by removing any that he felt were too interesting.

===The Book===
[[Image:26GasStations-needles.jpg|thumb|340px|left|''Union, Needles, California'', one of the double-page spreads in the book]]
Dated 1962 in the foreword and dedicated to Patty Callahan, the book comprises twenty-six photographs of various dimensions and proportions; most are laid out on a single page with the text facing the image; some go across the double spread, a few are placed next to each other. Three images are taken at night, including one of [[Tucumcari, New Mexico]], that appears to have been taken from a moving car. But for three people walking across the forecourt on the [[Sunset Strip]], a man getting out of his car at [[Flagstaff, Arizona]] and a man looking under his hood at [[Lipton]], [[Arizona]], there are no people present. There are no cars visible in some of the photographs and almost all are taken from the other side of the highway.

All of the gasoline stations are on [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]], a road that had already been mythologized by the TV series [[Route 66 (TV series)|''Route 66'']] and in [[John Steinbeck|Steinbeck's]] ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'', and later reappeared as a motif in [[Dennis Hopper|Dennis Hopper's]] ''[[Easy Rider]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The order that the stations appear is almost the same as their position on the route west-east, with five stations moved out of order.&lt;ref&gt;If each station is assigned a letter, the order is ABECDIGHJKLFMNOPQSTUWRXYZV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Ruscha Editions, Engberg, Phillpot, Walker Art Center, 1999 p63&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the last station in Groom, Texas, the relevant states listed are all in order.

The first edition was numbered and occasionally signed, which Ruscha later admitted was a "mistake".&lt;ref name="Artforum"/&gt; Apart from this detail, the books are defined by their "professional polish, a clear-cut machine finish."&lt;ref name="Artforum"/&gt; Ruscha has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have eliminated all text from my books- I want absolutely neutral material. My pictures are not that interesting, nor the subject matter. They are simply a collection of 'facts', my book is more like a collection of [[readymade]]s.....It is almost worth the money to have the thrill of 400 exactly identical books stacked in front of you.&lt;ref name="Artforum"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, in an interview in the ''[[National Observer (USA)|National Observer]]'', Ruscha declared "I want to be the [[Henry Ford]] of book making."&lt;ref&gt;Ed Ruscha, Interview in the ''[[National Observer (USA)|National Observer]]'', July 28, 1969, reprinted ''Leave Any Information at the Signal'', Schwartz, October Books, 2002, p28&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is printed in black offset on white paper. It measures 17.9 x 14 x 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm (closed). It has 26 photographs on 48 pages. The title appears in red lettering on the cover and spine. First edition: 400 numbered copies; second edition, 1967: 500 copies, third edition, 1969: 3000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Ruscha, exhibition catalog, eds. Neal Benezra and Kerry Brougher, Zürich, a.o. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is covered with a semi-transparent [[glassine]] dust jacket for protection. About fifty copies of the first edition came in a black cardboard slipcase. Apart from this, the numbering on the last page of the first edition and the details of each edition at the beginning of the book, the three are indistinguishable.

===Possible meanings===
A lot of critics have assigned a religious sub-text to the work, seeing a correlation between the gasoline stations and the 14 [[Stations of the Cross]], traditionally the staging posts between Pilate's condemnation and the burial of Christ after his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] on [[Calvary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_n5_v35/ai_19225277 Artforum Jan 1997, essay by Dave Hickey, reproduced at BNet UK]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kukje.org/old_eng/artists_view.php?ex_no=42 Kukje Gallery Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Ruscha, a lapsed catholic, has gone some way to supporting this view in interviews:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a connection between my work and my experience with religious icons, and the stations of the cross and the Church generally, but it's in one of method, you know; I do have some flavors that come over, like the incense... we all go through stages... the attitude comes out of a whole style of living and then coming up with statements.&lt;ref&gt;Ruscha quoted in ''I Dont Want No Retro Spective'', Hickey &amp; Plagens, Hudson Hills Press, 1982, p19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book has also been cited as an artist's book equivalent of a road movie,&lt;ref name="Retro"&gt;''I Dont Want No Retro Spective'', Hickey &amp; Plagens, Hudson Hills Press, 1982, foreword.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a pop version of [[Walker Evans]]' photographs of America, such as his deserted gasoline station in 'Highway Corner Reedsville West Virginia, 1935'. Although Ruscha has admitted knowledge of Evans' work, he has dismissed it as an influence.&lt;ref&gt;''Ed Ruscha'', R Marshall, Phaidon, 2003, p58&lt;/ref&gt; The last image, of a Fina station, has been interpreted as a [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchampian]] pun on ''Fin'' (end).&lt;ref name="Retro"/&gt;

==Reception==
Originally, the book was received poorly; despite being published the same year as Ruscha's first exhibition at the [[Ferus Gallery]], Los Angeles-which also represented [[Andy Warhol]]- the book was rejected by the Library of Congress for its 'unorthodox form and supposed lack of information'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.franklinbooks.com/servlet/the-749/Twentysix-Gasoline-Stations-by/Detail |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711022726/http://www.franklinbooks.com/servlet/the-749/Twentysix-Gasoline-Stations-by/Detail |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book gradually acquired cult status through the 1960s, and by the 1980s was often hailed as the first modern artist's book&lt;ref name="Drucker"/&gt; although in fact [[Dieter Roth|Dieter Roth's]] artist's books share the same mass-produced aesthetic and investigate the nature of books with at least as much formal vigour, and predate Ruscha's first publication by seven years.&lt;ref name="Drucker"/&gt; Additionally, [[Warja Honegger-Lavater|Warja Lavater's]] first book, ''William Tell'' (New York: Junior Council, [[Museum of Modern Art]], 1962 (OCLC {{OCLC search link|10911288}}), an accordion folded book written using symbols only, preceded Ruscha's ''Twentysix Gasoline Stations''.

Copies of the book are kept in public collections across the world, including [[MOMA]], [[V&amp;A]], [[Tate]], and the [[National Gallery of Australia]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[Image:Sample ULAN term2.jpg|frame|Sample ULAN Record, [[Mark Rothko]] continued.]]
The '''Union List of Artist Names''' ('''ULAN''') is a free [[online database]] of the [[Getty Research Institute]] using a [[controlled vocabulary]], which by 2018 contained over 300,000 artists and over 720,000 names for them, as well as other information about artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/faq.html ULAN FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Names in ULAN may include given names, pseudonyms, variant spellings, names in multiple languages, and names that have changed over time (e.g., married names). Among these names, one is flagged as the preferred name. 

Although it is displayed as a list, ULAN is structured as a [[Thesaurus (information retrieval)|thesaurus]], compliant with ISO and NISO standards for thesaurus construction; it contains hierarchical, equivalence, and associative relationships.

The focus of each ULAN record is an artist. In the database, each artist record (also called a subject) is identified by a unique numeric ID. The artist's nationality is given, as are places and dates of birth and death (if known).&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, Heidi G. (2008)."Resources for Jewish Biography and Autobiography on the Internet". ''Shofar'' '''26'''(2), 128–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Linked to each artist record are names, related artists, sources for the data, and notes. The temporal coverage of the ULAN ranges from Antiquity to the present and the scope is global.

Artists may be either individuals (persons) or groups of individuals working together (corporate bodies). Artists in the ULAN generally represent creators involved in the conception or production of visual arts and architecture. Some performance artists are included (but typically not actors, dancers, or other performing artists). Repositories and some donors are included as well.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/vocabularies/ulan/about.html About ULAN] &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Development of the ULAN began in 1984 by the J. Paul Getty Trust. The Trust, which already managed the [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]] (AAT), began the project in response to requests from Getty projects for controlled vocabularies of artists' names.&lt;ref name="Harpring_2010"/&gt; The ULAN grows and changes via contributions from the user community and editorial work of the [[Getty Vocabulary Program]].&lt;ref name="Harpring_2010"&gt;Harpring, Patricia (2010). "Development of the Getty Vocabularies: AAT, TGN, ULAN, and CONA". ''Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America'' '''29'''(1), 67–72. &lt;/ref&gt;

Although originally intended only for use by Getty projects, the broader art information community outside the Getty expressed a need to use ULAN for cataloging and retrieval. The Getty thus distributed ULAN for broader use according to the tenets previously established for the construction and maintenance of the Art and Architecture Thesaurus: Its scope includes names needed to catalog and retrieve information about the visual arts and architecture; it is based on terminology that is current, warranted for use by authoritative literary sources, and validated by use in the scholarly art and architectural history community; and it is compiled and edited in response to the needs of the user community. Originally constructed as a simple alphabetized "union list" of clustered artist names and biographies, in order to make it consistent with the AAT and [[Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names]], in the late 1990s ULAN was brought into compliance with national and international [[ISO 25964|standards for thesaurus construction]]. Its scope was broadened to include corporate bodies such as architectural firms and repositories of art, which may have hierarchical levels.

The ULAN was founded under the management of Eleanor Fink (head of what was then called the Vocabulary Coordination Group, and later Director of the Art History Information Program, later called the Getty Information Institute).&lt;ref name="Austin1995"&gt;Austin, David L. (1995). ''Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America'' '''14'''(2), 48–49. &lt;/ref&gt; The ULAN has been constructed over the years by numerous members of the user community and an army of dedicated editors, under the supervision of several managers. The ULAN was published in 1994 in hardcopy (Union List of Artist Names. Project manager, James M. Bower; senior editor, Murtha Baca. New York: G.K. Hall, 1994) and machine-readable files.&lt;ref name="Austin1995"/&gt; Given the growing size and frequency of changes and additions to the ULAN, by 1997 it had become evident that hard-copy publication was impractical. It is now published in automated formats only, in both a searchable online Web interface and in data files available for licensing. The data for ULAN is compiled and edited in an editorial system that was custom-built by Getty technical staff to meet the unique requirements of compiling data from many contributors, merging, moving, and publishing in various formats. Final editorial control of the ULAN is maintained by the Getty Vocabulary Program, using well-established editorial rules. The current managers of the ULAN are Patricia Harpring, Managing Editor, and Murtha Baca, Head, Vocabulary Program and Digital Resource Management.

==Design==
Even though the structure is relatively flat, the ULAN is constructed as a hierarchical database; its trees branch from a root called Top of the ULAN hierarchies (Subject_ID: 500000001); it currently has two published facets: Person and Corporate Body. Entities in the Person facet typically have no children. Entities in the Corporate Body facet may branch into trees. There may be multiple broader contexts, making the ULAN structure polyhierarchical. In addition to the hierarchical relationships, the ULAN also has equivalent and associative relationships.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12319">'''Variable data printing''' ('''VDP''') (also known as '''variable information printing''' ('''VIP''') or '''variable imaging''' ('''VI''')) is a form of digital printing,  including [[on-demand printing]], in which elements such as [[Writing|text]], [[graphics]] and [[image]]s may be changed from one printed piece to the next, without stopping or slowing down the printing process and using information from a [[database]] or external file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABC’s of VDP – A Variable Data Printing Basics Guide|url=http://www.efi.com/documents/promo/abc/ABCs_VDP_Letter.pdf|publisher=Electronics for Imaging, Inc.|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a set of personalized letters, each with the same basic layout, can be printed with a different name and address  on each letter. Variable data printing is mainly used for [[direct marketing]], [[customer relationship management]], [[advertising]], invoicing and  applying addressing&lt;ref name="Mailing"&gt;{{cite news|title=Saving Mailing Costs with Variable Data Printing|url=http://www.ondemandexpo.com/on-demand-newsletter/saving-mailing-costs-with-variable-data-printing|accessdate=1 June 2011|newspaper=On Demand Expo eNewletter|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on selfmailers, brochures or postcard campaigns.

==Variable data printing==

VDP is a direct outgrowth of [[digital printing]], which harnesses computer databases and digital print devices and highly effective software to create high-quality, full color documents, with a look and feel comparable to conventional [[offset printing]]. Variable data printing enables the [[mass customization]] of documents via digital print technology, as opposed to the '[[mass-production]]' of a single document using [[offset lithography]]. Instead of producing 10,000 copies of a single document, delivering a single message to 10,000 customers, variable data printing could print 10,000 unique documents with customized messages for each customer.

The returns for variable printing vary from double the normal return at the basic level to 10–15 times the return for fully variable jobs.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} This naturally depends on content and the relevancy of that content, but the technique presents an effective tool for increasing [[return on investment|ROI]] on marketing campaigns.

There are several levels of variable printing. The most basic level involves changing the salutation or name on each copy much like [[mail merge]]. More complicated variable data printing uses 'versioning', where there may be differing amounts of customization for different markets, with text and images changing for groups of addresses based upon which segment of the market is being addressed. Finally there is full variability printing, where the text and images can be altered for each individual address. All variable data printing begins with a basic design that defines static elements and variable fields for the pieces to be printed. While the static elements appear exactly the same on each piece, the variable fields are filled in with text or images as dictated by a set of application and style rules and the information contained in the database.

There are three main operational methodologies for variable data printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Variable-Data Printing: Personalized Delivery of Information for the 21st Century|url=http://www.digitaloutput.net/content/ContentCT.asp?P=78|publisher=Rockport Custom Publishing, LLC|accessdate=4 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001035330/http://www.digitaloutput.net/content/ContentCT.asp?P=78|archive-date=1 October 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one methodology, a static document is loaded into printer memory.  The printer is instructed, through the [[print driver]] or [[raster image processor]] (RIP) to always print the static document when sending any page out to the printer driver or RIP.  Variable data can then be printed on top of the static document.  This methodology is the simplest way to execute VDP, however its capability is less than that of a typical mail merge.

A second methodology is to combine the static and variable elements into print files, prior to printing, using standard software. This produces a conventional (and potentially huge) print file&lt;ref name="Tongues"&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaking In Tongues: Sorting Out Variable Data Printing Languages|url=http://www.fujixerox.com.au/products/image/media/TSR-0906-Speak-Tongues-reprint.pdf|work=Volume 7, Number 17|publisher=The Seybold Report|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with every image being merged into every page.  A shortcoming of this methodology is that running many very large print files can overwhelm the RIP's processing capability. When this happens, printing speeds might become slow enough to be impractical for a print job of more than a few hundred pages.

A third methodology is to combine the static and variable elements into print files, prior to printing, using specialized VDP software. This produces optimized print files, such as [[PDF/VT]], PostScript or [[PPML]],&lt;ref name="Tongues" /&gt; that maximize print speed since the RIP only needs to process static elements once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hohensee|first=Reinhard|title=Managing Variable Data Full-Color Printing at High Speeds|url=http://www.infoprintsolutionscompany.com/internet/comnelit.nsf/Files/ManagingPrintatHighSpeedInfoPrint/$File/ManagingPrintatHighSpeedInfoPrint.pdf|publisher=InfoPrint Solutions|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software and services==

There are many software packages available to merge text and images into VDP print files. Some are stand-alone software packages, however most of the advanced VDP software packages are actually plug-in modules for one or more publishing software packages such as [[Adobe Creative Suite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Generation of Variable Data Publishing Solutions|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/vdp/pdfs/vdp_whitepaper.pdf|publisher=Adobe Systems Incorporated|accessdate=5 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002170743/http://www.adobe.com/products/vdp/pdfs/vdp_whitepaper.pdf|archive-date=2 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides VDP software, other software packages may be necessary for VDP print projects. Mailing software is necessary in the United States ([[United States Postal Service]]) and Canada to take advantage of reduced postage for [[bulk mailing]].&lt;ref name="Mailing" /&gt; Used prior to the VDP print file creation, mailing software presorts and validates and generates bar codes for mailing addresses. Pieces can then be printed in the proper sequence for sorting by postal code. In Canada, [[Canada Post]] now offers a 'Machineable'&lt;ref&gt;https://www.canadapost.ca/tools/pg/manual/default-e.asp&lt;/ref&gt; personalized mail category which does not require addresses to be sorted into any specific order before mailing; therefore reducing the need for specialized sorting software to obtain optimal postage rates. 

Software to manage data quality (e.g. for duplicate removal or handling of bad records) and uniformity may also be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frey|first=Franziska|title=Upstream Database and Digital Asset Management in Variable Data Printing|url=http://print.rit.edu/pubs/picrm200801.pdf|publisher=Printing Industry Center at RIT|accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In lieu of purchasing software, various companies provide an assortment of VDP-related print file, mailing and data services.

==Benefits==

The difference between variable data printing and traditional printing is the personalization that is involved. Personalization allows a company to connect to its customers. Variable data printing is more than a variable name or address in a printed piece; in the past, a variable name would have been effective, because it was a new concept at the time. In today’s world, personalization has to reflect what the customer values. In order for VDP to be successful, the company must know something about the customer. For example, a customer who loves baseball receives a VDP postcard with an image of their favorite baseball player. The postcard is effective, because the customer is more likely to read what is on it. An example of an ineffective VDP piece would be to mail a postcard to the same customer with an image of a soccer player. If the customer has no interest in soccer, then he or she may or may not pay attention to the postcard. The idea is to add value to the customer through the ability to relate to them. Personalization allows a company to relate, communicate, and possibly start a relationship with a prospective customer and to maintain a relationship with their current customers. A prospect that is converted to a customer can then be converted to a loyal customer. Companies want to create loyal customers, and variable data printing can help gain these types of customers, along with quality work and service.&lt;ref name="Tierney"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tierney|first=Jim|title=Variable data printing update|url=http://multichannelmerchant.com/printchannel/0301-variable-data-printing-update/index.html|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another benefit is the increase in the response rate and response time. Because personalization catches the attention of the consumer, the response rate of a mail campaign increases. Personalization also increases the response time, because the mailed piece has an effect on the consumer. This effect causes the consumer to respond quicker. A mailed piece that is not eye-catching may be put down and forgotten until a later time, so it may take weeks before a response is received.&lt;ref name="Tierney"/&gt;

==Integration==

Variable data printing can be combined with other platforms – such as [[Persistent uniform resource locator|PURLS]], email blasts, and QR codes; all three platforms are considered marketing tools. Many people have found the benefit of combining all of these platforms in order to have a successful campaign. Email blasts and PURLS allow a company to find out information about their consumer. An email blasts usually doesn’t contain much personalization, but it can. The bulk of the personalization would be seen in a PURL. A PURL is a personalized uniform resource locator (URL). In short, it is a landing page. It is also where most of the knowledge about the consumer will be gained. The email blasts will contain a PURL, which will lead the consumer to a personalized page. The PURL is where a company can gain information about the consumer through the requested information. The QR code can be added to a mailed piece. It works like an email blasts. It directs the consumer to a website. The integration of these three platforms can help a campaign.&lt;ref name="Tierney"/&gt;

==Origin of the concept==

The origin of the term variable data printing is widely credited to Frank Romano, Professor Emeritus, School of Print Media, at the [[College of Imaging Arts and Sciences]] at [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]. Mr. Romano does not explicitly take credit for coining the term &lt;ref name="Romano"&gt;{{cite web

 | url = http://www.ez-vdp.com/content.cfm?id=2063&amp;le=1

but points to his use of it as early as 1969 and its appearance in the 1999 book, “Personalized and Database Printing”, that he authored with David Broudy.&lt;ref name="Romano" /&gt;

The concept of merging static document elements and variable document elements predates the term and has seen various implementations ranging from simple desktop '[[mail merge]]', to complex [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] applications in the financial and banking industry. In the past, the term VDP has been most closely associated with digital printing machines. However, in recent years the application of this technology has spread to web pages, emails, and mobile messaging.

Active in [[Berlin]] and in their hometown, Breslau ([[Wrocław]]), the brothers were known for [[drawing]]s, [[pastel]]s, [[engraving]]s, miniature paintings, and [[lithography|lithographs]].&lt;ref name="BBAW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Henschel Brothers." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. 2nd Ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. Vol. 8., p. 811.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Wilhelm and his brothers were born of a Jewish family, in Trachenberg ([[Żmigród]]), and grew up in Breslau, then in [[Prussia]]n  [[Silesia]]. Their father, Hirsch Henschel, was a merchant; their uncle (Hirsch's older brother) Elias Henschel (1755-1839) was a prominent physician.&lt;ref name="Kirschstein"&gt;Kirschstein, Sally (1918). “[http://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/freimann/content/pageview/415524 Die Gebrüder Henschel].” In: Kirschstein, Juedische Graphiker aus der Zeit von 1625-1825. Berlin: Der Zirkel. p. 41-70. Includes illustrations of the Henschels' work in a section of plates following the article.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43–45}}  In Breslau the brothers attended the new Jewish secular school (the Wilhelmschule, founded 1791), where, among other subjects, they learned drawing.&lt;ref name="Kirschstein"/&gt;{{rp|45}}

The brothers moved to Berlin around 1804 to pursue their art; in that year Wilhelm Henschel exhibited for the first time at the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]].&lt;ref name="BBAW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerlach, Klaus (2015). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=OZAoCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 August Wilhelm Ifflands Berliner Bühne: "Theatralische Kunstführung und Oekonomie"]''. Berlin: De Gruyter. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1806 all four brothers had individual entries in the Academy exhibition; and in 1810 they collectively participated with some ten works, including pastels and engravings.&lt;ref name="BBAW"/&gt;

The Henschel brothers' oeuvre focused on portraits (including memorial portraiture), theater and ballet performances, and cityscapes.&lt;ref name="Gerlach2013"&gt;Gerlach, Klaus (2013/2014). "Chronisten des Flüchtigen: Die Brüder Henschel portraitieren in Berlin eine Großstadtkultur um 1800." In:  ''Die Akademie am Gendarmenmarkt'' 2013/2014. p. 53-57. German-language magazine of the Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften, available as a [http://www.bbaw.de/publikationen/jahresmagazin/jahresmagazin-2013-14 PDF file].&lt;/ref&gt; Besides producing engravings, they were among the first in Berlin to experiment with the new printing technique of [[lithography]].&lt;ref name="Kirschstein"/&gt;{{rp|54}}

Between 1809 and 1818 they published a series of engravings depicting the popular German actor [[August Wilhelm Iffland]], in scenes from plays, under the title ''Ifflands mimische Darstellungen für Schauspieler und Zeichner'', in 20 issues, of six plates each.&lt;ref name="BBAW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirschstein"/&gt;{{rp|47–48}} The drawings on which the works were based were mainly by Wilhelm Henschel, while August Henschel was responsible for the engravings.&lt;ref name="BBAW"/&gt; The drawings were made from life during performances Iffland gave at Prussia's [[Konzerthaus Berlin|royal national theater]] (Königliches Nationaltheater) between 1808 and 1811, in roles such as  [[King Lear]], [[Shylock]], and [[William Tell (play)|Wilhelm Tell]] (in the play by [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]); each depicted a particular scene and was captioned with lines from the play.

In an age in which the theater held a central place in German culture, the Henschel brothers conceived of these works as an aid to actors, artists, and the educated public for grasping the art of expression; and believed that the best means of engaging the intellect was through a combination of text and image.&lt;ref name="Gerlach2013"/&gt; The eminent [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], who was familiar with the Henschels' work, took note of the Iffland publication in his periodical ''[[Über Kunst und Altertum]]'', remarking favorably on the skill with which they captured Iffland's expressions and gestures.&lt;ref&gt;“[http://bk-prototype.humanities-data-centre.org/personen/5485 Henschel, Wilhelm].” In: ''Berliner Klassik Datenbank''. Retrieved 2016-03-26. Goethe's comments were published in his journal ''Über Kunst und Altertum'', vol. 2, no. 2, 1818, p. 74-75; available online: [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs3/object/display/bsb10913664_00324.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812 the Prussian Academy of Arts bestowed upon Wilhelm Henschel and his brother August the title “Akademische Künstler” (academic artist), although, as Jews, they were never members of the academy.&lt;ref name="BBAW"/&gt;

In 1819, in honor of Goethe's 70th birthday, the Henschel brothers began work on a series of pictures depicting scenes from the poet's life, based on episodes he recounts in the first volume of his autobiography (''[[Dichtung und Wahrheit|Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahrheit]]''). They dedicated the work to the Prussian king, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm&amp;nbsp;III]], and sent the king a first printing of an initial set, in May 1819;&lt;ref name="BBAW"/&gt; the series was finally completed and published in its entirety as ''Scenen aus Goethe's Leben'' (Scenes from Goethe's life) in 1821.&lt;ref name="Kirschstein"/&gt;{{rp|58}}

The Henschel brothers produced portraits of many personalities of Berlin of their times, including [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], [[August von Kotzebue]], and [[Julius von Voss]].&lt;ref name="Gerlach2013"/&gt; They produced numerous portraits for the king and his family, including memorial portraits following the death of [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Luise]], in 1810.&lt;ref name="Kirschstein"/&gt;{{rp|65}}

When August Henschel died in 1828, Wilhelm returned to his home city of Breslau; his two other brothers, Friedrich and Moritz, had already done so at an earlier point, even as they had all continued to work as an artistic team.&lt;ref name="Kirschstein"/&gt;{{rp|65–66}}
