In [[linguistics]], an '''alphaphonetic pronunciation''' is the pronunciation of an [[alphabet]]ical glyph ("[[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]") with the canonical pronunciation employed in learning the alphabet, rather than in accord with other [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] variants. It is a concept within [[phonemic orthography]], particularly with the pronunciation of [[vowel]]s, in which the alphabetic pronunciation of a letter name is taken as a default and employed in the pronunciation of particular [[word]]s spelled with that letter. [[Phonological change]] may be constrained by the influence of canonical [[alphabet#Pronunciation|alphabet pronunciation]].

== Overview ==
In languages such as [[English language|English]] in which many words have several [[morphophonemic]] variants, the pronunciation of the letters of the alphabet influences an invariant "alphaphonemic pronunciation" of words. The concept is less relevant to languages like [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in which the phonemic orthographies are always alphaphonemic, and thus no distinctions are relevant. The latter type of languages may be said to have "good" or "1:1" grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence.

For example, the letter "a," in English alphaphonemic pronunciation, is pronounced {{IPAc-en|eɪ}} and not {{IPAc-en|ɑː}} as in [[Latin]]-based languages. 
Hence a word like "[[amen]]," which in its original Latin alphaphonemic pronunciation is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} ("ah-men"), in English it is often pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} ("A-men"). In both American and British English, the English alphaphonemic pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} is colloquially (if not formally) dominant, while the {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|ˈ|m|ɛ|n}} pronunciation is typically regarded as "Latin" or "Latinized" (which, in context of Protestantism, may carry a certain negative connotation of [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] culture and influence).

The English alphaphonemic pronunciation of many words can be confusing to non-English speakers. The letter "i" in English words like "light" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|aɪ|t}}, "bicycle" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|s|ᵻ|k|əl}}, "triad" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|aɪ|.|æ|d}}, "final" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|aɪ|n|əl}}, and "spike" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|p|aɪ|k}} are all pronounced alphaphonemically, and thus differ particularly from other orthographies. (The historic basis for this is in the [[Great Vowel Shift]].) For example, with Latin-based language speakers, a Latin-based pronunciation of "i" is constant, and considers "i" to always indicate {{IPAc-en|ɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|iː}}. In Latin orthography, the English alphaphonemic "I" {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} is spelled "ai," not "i," thus the Latin orthographic transcription of English pronunciations would be close the IPA examples above, while their native pronunciations of these English words would unintelligible (variations from English [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], etc. isolated in [brackets],): "light" {{IPA|/ˈliː[x]t/}}, "bicycle" {{IPA|/ˈbiːsikl[ɛ]/}}, "triad" {{IPA|/ˈtriː[aː]d/}}, "final" {{IPA|/ˈfiːn[aː]l/}}, and "spike" {{IPA|/ˈspiːk[ɛ]/}}.

As these examples show, because English alphaphonemics deviate significantly from Latinate pronunciations, the correspondence of English word spellings with their correct English pronunciations are not intuitively obvious to a learner.

In [[rhetoric]], '''antimetabole''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|t|ᵻ|m|ə|ˈ|t|æ|b|ə|l|iː}} {{respell|AN|ti-mə|TAB|ə-lee}}) is the repetition of words in successive clauses, but in transposed order; for example, "I know what I like, and I like what I know". It is related to, and sometimes considered a special case of, [[chiasmus]].

An antimetabole is also said to be a little too predictive because it is easy to reverse the key term, but it can pose questions that one usually would not think of if the phrase were just asked or said the initial way.&lt;ref&gt;Fahnestock, Jeanne. Rhetorical Figures in Science. Oxford University Press, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;123-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lanham|year=1991|title=A Handlist of Rhetorical Terms|location=Berkeley; Los Angeles, Calif.; London|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-07669-3|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be the threat "Get out, or else—!"  This device often portrays its users as overcome with passion (fear, anger, excitement) or [[modesty]]. To mark the occurrence of aposiopesis with punctuation, an [[Dash#Em dash|em dash]] (—) or an [[ellipsis]] (…) may be used.

==Examples==
* A classical example of aposiopesis in [[Virgil]] occurs in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' 2.100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Justice|editor=Frank Grady|others=Andrew Galloway|chapter=Chaucer's History-Effect|title=Answerable Style: The Idea of the Literary in Medieval England|series=Interventions: New Studies in Medieval Culture|publisher=[[Ohio State University Press]]|year=2013|isbn=978-0-8142-1207-3|pages=169–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinon, the Greek who is posing as a defector to deceive the Trojans into accepting the Trojan Horse within their city wall, tells about how Ulixes 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''hinc mihi prima malis labes, hinc semper Vlixes''
''criminibus terrere nouis, hinc spargere uoces''
''in uulgum ambiguas et quaerere conscius arma.''
''nec requieuit enim, donec Calchante ministro—''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
This was the time when the first onslaught of ruin began for me.
Ulixes kept terrifying me with new accusations,
kept spreading ambiguous rumors among the people,
and kept looking for quarrel.
Nor did he in fact ever stop, until with the help of Calchas—
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* A [[Bible|biblical]] example is found in [[Psalms|Psalm]] 27, verse 13.{{refn|group=nb|Other English translations insert extra words, example "I had fainted, unless" (King James Version). Another example is "Yet I am confident that" (New Living Translation). Only the Hebrew conjunction "unless" appears&amp;nbsp;– translators add the extra words to make the phrase appear as a complete thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psalm 27:13|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/ylt/psa/27/1/s_505001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225191343/https://www.blueletterbible.org/ylt/psa/27/1/s_505001|archivedate=25 February 2016|work=[[Blue Letter Bible]] ([[Young's Literal Translation]])|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} it says: "Unless I had believed I would see the goodness of the [[God|Lord]] in the land of the living …" The implication is that the author does not know what he would have done.
* King Lear, overcome by anger at his daughters, says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
No, you unnatural hags,
I will have such revenges on you both,
That all the world shall— I will do such things,—
What they are, yet I know not:  but they shall be
The terrors of the earth. ([[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], ''[[King Lear]]'', II.iv)
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Aposiopesis also occurs at the agitated climax of Mercutio's "[[Queen Mab]]" speech, resulting in a calming intervention by Romeo:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''Mercutio''. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
              That presses them and learns them first to bear,
              Making them women of good carriage:
              This is she—

''Romeo''.    Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!  
              Thou talk'st of nothing. (Shakespeare, ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', I.iv)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

==Grammatical definition==
In syntax, an aposiopesis arises when the "if" clause ([[Protasis (linguistics)|protasis]]) of a [[conditional sentence|condition]] is stated without an ensuing "then" clause, or [[apodosis (linguistics)|apodosis]]. Because an aposiopesis implies a trailing off of thought, it is never directly followed by a period, which would effectively result in four consecutive dots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Weir Smyth|title=Greek Grammar|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=1920|isbn=978-0-674-36250-5|pages=674}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{examples needed|date=April 2013}}

'''Aquatic feeding mechanisms''' face a special difficulty as compared to feeding on land, because the density of water is about the same as that of the prey, so the prey tends to be pushed away when the mouth is closed. This problem was first identified by [[Robert McNeill Alexander]].&lt;ref name="Alexander67"&gt;[[Robert McNeill Alexander|Alexander, R. McN]]. 1967. ''Functional design in fishes''. London, UK: Hutchinson University Library.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, underwater [[predator]]s, especially [[bony fish]], have evolved a number of specialized feeding mechanisms, such as [[filter feeding]], ram feeding, suction feeding, protrusion, and pivot feeding.

Most underwater predators combine more than one of these basic principles. For example, a typical generalized predator, such as the [[cod]], combines suction with some amount of protrusion and pivot feeding.

== Suction feeding ==

}}
'''Suction feeding''' is a method of ingesting a prey item in fluids by sucking the prey into the predator's mouth. This is typically accomplished by the predator expanding the volume of its oral cavity and/or throat, resulting in a pressure difference between the inside of the mouth and the outside environment.  When the mouth is opened, the pressure difference causes water to flow into the predator's mouth, carrying the prey item in with the fluid flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauder|first=George|year=1980|title=The suction feeding mechanism in sunfish (Lepomis): an experimental analysis|url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~glauder/reprints_unzipped/Lauder1980.pdf|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=|pages=49–72|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though suction feeding can be seen across fish species, those with more derived characters show an increase in the suction force as a result of more complex [[Fish head|skull]] linkages that allow greater expansion of the buccal cavity and thereby creating a greater negative pressure. Most commonly this is achieved by increasing the lateral expansion of the skull.

'''Ram feeding''', also known as '''lunge feeding''', is a method of feeding underwater in which the predator moves forward with its mouth open, engulfing the prey along with the water surrounding it.  During ram feeding, the prey remains fixed in space, and the predator moves its jaws past the prey to capture it.  The motion of the head may induce a [[bow wave]] in the fluid which pushes the prey away from the jaws, but this can be avoided by allowing water to flow through the jaw.  This can be accomplished by means of an expandable throat, as in [[snapping turtle]]s and [[baleen whales]],&lt;ref name=goldbogen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldbogen | first1 = J.

[[Herring]]s often [[Forage fish#Hunting copepods|hunt copepods]]. If they encounter copepods [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]] in high concentrations, the herrings switch to ram feeding. They swim with their mouth wide open and their [[Operculum (fish)|opercula]] fully expanded. Every several feet, they close and clean their [[gill raker]]s for a few milliseconds ([[filter feeding]]).  The fish all open their mouths and opercula wide at the same time (the red gills are visible in the photo below&amp;mdash;click to enlarge).  The fish swim in a grid where the distance between them is the same as the jump length of the copepods.

=== Lunge feeding ===
[[Baleen whale]]s feed on [[plankton]] by a technique called [[Lunge feed#Predator strategies|lunge feeding]]. Lunge feeding could be regarded as a kind of inverted suction feeding, during which a whale takes a huge gulp of water, which is then filtered through the [[baleen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldbogen | first1 = JA | last2 = Calambokidis | first2 = J | last3 = Shadwick | first3 = RE | last4 = Oleson | first4 = EM | last5 = McDonald | first5 = MA | last6 = Hildebrand | first6 = J A | year = 2006 | title = Kinematics of foraging dives and lunge-feeding in fin whales | url = http://cetus.ucsd.edu/Publications/Publications/GoldbogenJEB2006.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 209 | issue = | pages = 1231–1244 | doi=10.1242/jeb.02135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomechanically this is a unique and extreme feeding method, for which the animal at first must accelerate to gain enough [[momentum]] to fold its elastic throat ([[buccal cavity]]) around the volume of water to be swallowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Potvin | first1 = J | last2 = Goldbogen | first2 = JA | year = 2009 | title = ''Passive versus active engulfment: verdict from trajectory simulations of lunge-feeding fin whales ''Balaenoptera physalus | url = http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/40/1005.full | journal = J.

The highly elastic and [[muscular]] buccal rills are a specialized adaptation to this feeding mode.

== Pivot feeding ==
[[File:Black Sea fauna Seahorse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Seahorse]]s rely on stealth to ambush small prey such as [[copepod]]s.

'''Pivot feeding''' is a method to transport the mouth towards the prey by an upward turning of the head, which is pivoting on the neck joint. [[Pipefish]] such as [[sea horses]] and [[Leafy seadragon|sea dragons]] are specialized on this feeding mechanism.&lt;ref name="lussanet"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Lussanet | first1 = M. H.

The secret of the speed of pivot feeding is in a [[Linkage (mechanical)#Biological linkages|locking mechanism]], in which the [[hyoid arch]] is folded under the head and is aligned with the urohyal which connects to the [[shoulder girdle]]. A [[four-bar linkage]] at first locks the head in a ventrally bent position by the alignment of two bars. The release of the locking mechanism jets the head up and moves the mouth toward the prey within 5-10 ms. The trigger mechanism of unlocking is debated, but is probably in lateral [[adduction]].

== Protrusion ==

'''Protrusion''' is the extension of the mouth or [[premaxilla]] towards the prey, via [[Linkage (mechanical)#Biological linkages|mechanical linkages]].

== Filter and suspension feeding ==
[[File:Filterkrillkils2.gif|thumb|upright|[[Krill]] feeding under high [[phytoplankton]] concentration (slowed down by a factor of 12)]]

This is the selection of food particles from a water flow, for example by the [[gill rakers]] of fish, the baleens of [[baleen whales|whales]], or the ostia of [[sponges]].

=== Filter feeding ===
In '''[[filter feeding]]''', the water flow is primarily generated by the organism itself, for example by creating a pressure, by active swimming, or by [[cilium|ciliary]] movements.

=== Suspension feeding ===
In '''suspension feeding''', the water flow is primarily external or if the particles themselves move with respect to the ambient water, such as in [[sea lilies]].

[[File:Plan Rome - Arcus Novus.png|thumb|Location of Arcus Novus]]
The '''Arcus Novus''' was an ancient arch in Rome, located on the ''[[Via Lata (Rome)|Via lata]]'' (now the Via del Corso ), at the site of the church of [[Santa Maria in Via Lata]].

== History ==
The arch was dedicated to [[Diocletian]] either for the occasion of his ''[[decennalia]]'' in 293&amp;nbsp;AD, or his [[Roman Triumph|triumph]] celebrated with [[Maximian]] in 303–304. The name Arcus novus (new arch) probably refers to the earlier [[Arch of Claudius (British victory)|Arch of Claudius]] on the same street.{{sfn|Richardson|1992|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;pg=PA27 p.&amp;nbsp;27]}}

== Description ==
The Arcus Novus was decorated with reliefs reused (''[[spolia]]'') from a large altar of the Julio-Claudian period, most probably the ''Ara pietatis'', while the column [[plinths]] were decorated with images of ''[[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]]'', barbarian prisoners and the [[Dioskouri]], probably from the facade of the nearby [[Sol invictus|Temple of the Sun]] of [[Aurelian]]. The arch was destroyed in 1491 by order of Pope [[Innocent VIII]] during reconstruction of Santa Maria in Via Lata.{{sfn|Richardson|1992|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;pg=PA27 p.&amp;nbsp;27]}}

Fragments of the reliefs were discovered in 1523 and added to the [[Andrea della Valle|Della Valle]] collection before being acquired by [[Cardinal Ferdinand de' Medici]] in 1584, from where the plinths found their way to the [[Boboli Gardens]] in Florence. Other fragments from the [[Antonine]] period, reused by [[Diocletian]], were included in the rear facade of the cardinal's [[Villa Medici]] in Rome. More recently excavations carried out in 1923–1933 discovered further fragments now in the [[Capitoline Museums#Centrale_Montemartini|Centrale Montemartini]].{{sfn|Richardson|1992|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=K_qjo30tjHAC&amp;pg=PA27 p.&amp;nbsp;27]}}

'''Art &amp; Language''' is a [[conceptual art|conceptual artists']] collaboration that has undergone many changes since it was created in the late 1960s. The group was founded by artists who shared a common desire to combine intellectual ideas and concerns with the creation of art. The first issue of the group's journal, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]], was published in November 1969 in [[Chipping Norton]] in England, and was an important influence on conceptual art in the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lissongallery.com/artists/art-language|title=Art &amp; Language {{!}} Artists {{!}} Lisson Gallery|website=www.lissongallery.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First years==

The ''Art &amp; Language'' group was founded around 1967 in the United Kingdom by [[Terry Atkinson]] (b. 1939), [[David Bainbridge (artist)|David Bainbridge]] (b. 1941), [[Michael Baldwin (artist)|Michael Baldwin]] (b. 1945) and [[Harold Hurrell]] (b. 1940).&lt;ref&gt;Neil Mulholland, ''The Cultural Devolution: art in Britain in the late twentieth century'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003, p165. {{ISBN|0-7546-0392-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These four artists began their collaboration around 1966 while they were art teachers in [[Coventry]]. The name of the group was derived from their journal, [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]], originally created as a work conversation in 1966. The group was critical of what was considered mainstream modern art practices at the time. In their work conversations, they created conceptual art as part of their discussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/a/art-and-language|title=Art &amp; Language {{!}} Tate|website=www.tate.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1968 and 1982, the group grew to nearly fifty people. Among the first to join were critic and art historian, [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]], and artist [[Mel Ramsden]],&lt;ref&gt;Charles Green, ''The Third Hand: Collaboration in Art from Conceptualism to Postmodernism'', UNSW Press, 2001, p47. {{ISBN|0-86840-588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the early 1970s, individuals including [[Ian Burn]], [[Michael Corris]], [[Preston Heller]], [[Graham Howard]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Andrew Menard]], and [[Terry Smith (art historian)|Terry Smith]] joined the group. Two collaborators from Coventry, [[Philip Pilkington]] and [[David Rushton]], followed.
The relative degree of anonymity held within the group continues to have historical significance in the art community. Due to an uncertainty of the exact member lists, it is hard to know unequivocally not only who all of the contributors were but also what their exact contributions were.

The first issue of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leftmatrix.com/artlanguage.html|title=Art &amp; Language|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(Volume 1, Number 1, May 1969) is subtitled ''The Journal of Conceptual Art''.  By the second issue (Volume 1, Number 2, February 1970), it became clear that there were conceptual art pieces and conceptual artists for whom and to whom the journal did not speak. In order to better encompass the purpose of the journal, the title was abandoned. Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]] had, however, brought to light the beginning of a new art movement. It was the first [[wikt:imprint|imprint]] to identify a public entity called ''[[Conceptual art|Conceptual Art]].'' The journal was the first of its kind to serve the theoretical and conversational interests of a community of artists and critics, who were also its producers and users. While that community was far from a unanimous agreement as to how to define the nature of conceptual art, the editors and most of its historic contributors shared similar opinions about other art movements. Conceptual art was critical of [[modernism]] for its bureaucracy and its historicism, and of [[minimalism]] for its philosophical conservatism. The practice of conceptual art, especially in its early years of origin, was primarily based on theory, and its form, predominately textual.

As the distribution of the journal and the teaching practices of the editors and others contributors expanded, the conversation grew to include more people. In England, by 1971, artists and critics including [[Charles Townsend Harrison|Charles Harrison]], [[Philip Pilkington]], [[David Rushton]], [[Lynn Lemaster]], [[Sandra Harrison]], [[Graham Howard]] and [[Paul Wood (artist)|Paul Wood]] had joined. Around the same time in New York, [[Michael Corris]] joined, followed by [[Paula Ramsden]], [[Mayo Thompson]], [[Christine Kozlov]], Preston Heller, [[Andrew Menard]] and [[Kathryn Bigelow]].

The name ''Art &amp; Language'' remained precarious due to the various interpretations of both the many pieces of art and the purpose of the group. Its significance, or instrumentality, varied from person to person, alliance to alliance, discourse to discourse, and from those in New York who produced ''The Fox'' (1974–1976), for example, to those engaged in music projects and those who continued the Journal's edition. There was disagreement among members, and by 1976, there was a growing sense of divide that eventually led to competing individualities and varied concerns.

Throughout the 1970s, ''Art &amp; Language'' dealt with questions about art production and attempted a shift from conventional "nonlinguistic" forms of art, such as painting and sculpture, to more theoretically text-based works. The group often took argumentative positions against such prevailing views of critics like [[Clement Greenberg]] and [[Michael Fried]].
The ''Art &amp; Language'' group that exhibited in the international ''[[Documenta 5]]'' exhibitions of 1972 included Atkinson, Bainbridge, Baldwin, Hurrell, Pilkington, Rushton, and Joseph Kosuth, the American editor of [[Art-Language The Journal of conceptual art|Art-Language]]. The work consisted of a filing system of material published and circulated by ''Art &amp; Language'' members.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Bentkowska-Kafel, Trish Cashen, Hazel Gardiner, ''Digital Visual Culture: Theory and Practice'', Intellect Books, 2009, p104. {{ISBN|1-84150-248-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York Art &amp; Language==
Burn and Ramsden co-founded ''The Society for Theoretical Art'' and ''Analysis in New York'' in the late 1960s. They joined ''Art &amp; Language'' in 1970-71. ''New York Art &amp; Language'' became fragmented after 1975 because of disagreements concerning principles of collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Green, ''The Third Hand: Collaboration in Art from Conceptualism to Postmodernism'', UNSW Press, 2001, p48. {{ISBN|0-86840-588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Beveridge]] and [[Carol Condé]], who had been peripheral members of the group in New York, returned to Canada where they worked with trade unions and community groups. In 1977, Ian Burn returned to Australia and Mel Ramsden to the United Kingdom.

==Late 1970s==

By the end of the 1970s, the group was essentially reduced to Baldwin, Harrison, and Ramsden with the occasional participation of [[Mayo Thompson]] and his group [[Red Crayola]]. The political analysis and development within the group resulted in several members leaving the group to work in more activist-oriented political occupations. Ian Burn returned to Australia, joining Ian Milliss, a conceptual artist who had begun work with trade unions in the early 1970s, in becoming active in Union Media Services, a design studio for social and community initiatives and the development of trade unions. Other members from the United Kingdom drifted off into a variety of creative, academic and sometimes "politicized" activities.

At the beginning of the 1970s, there were about thirty members. The ''Art &amp; Language'' group emphasized the use of language on the theory that language is the basis from which ideas and concepts are built. Their philosophy was that language permits index words which appear, disappear, and for some even persist, thus allowing viewers and artists alike to analyze the evolution of a word through the proposal of different definitions.

==Exhibitions and awards==
=== Awards and critics ===
In 1986, ''Art &amp; Language'' was nominated for the [[Turner Prize]].
In 1999, ''Art &amp; Language'' exhibited at [[MoMA PS1|PS1 MoMA]] in New York, with a major installation entitled ''The Artist Out of Work''. This was a recollection of ''Art &amp; Language''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s dialogical and other practices, curated by Michael Corris and Neil Powell. This exhibition closely followed the revisionist exhibition of ''Global Conceptualism: Points of Origin'' at the [[Queens Museum|Queens Museum of Art]], also in New York. The ''Art &amp; Language'' show at PS1 offered an alternative account of the antecedents and legacy of '"classic" conceptual art and reinforced a transatlantic rather than nationalistic version of events from 1968-1972. In a negative appraisal of the exhibition, [[art critic]] [[Jerry Saltz]] wrote, "A quarter century ago, 'Art &amp; Language' forged an important link in the genealogy of conceptual art, but next efforts have been so self-sufficient and obscure that their work is now virtually irrelevant."&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Saltz, ''Seeing out loud: the Voice art columns, fall 1998-winter 2003'', Geoffrey Young, 2003, p293. {{ISBN|1-930589-17-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Permanent collections ===
Other exhibits around the world include the works of Atkinson and Baldwin (working as ''Art &amp; Language'') held in the collection of the [[Tate]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=2202&amp;page=1 tate.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Papers and works relating to ''New York Art &amp; Language'' are held at the [[Getty Research Institute]], Los Angeles. 

In March 2011, [[Philippe Méaille]] loaned 800 artworks of the ''Art &amp; Language'' collective to the [[Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art]], also known as MACBA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avui.cat/noticia/article/5-cultura/19-cultura/390089-un-tresor-al-macba.html?piwik_campaign=rss&amp;piwik_kwd=mesCultura Un tresor al Macba]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, the [[:fr:Conseil départemental de Maine-et-Loire|Conseil départemental de Maine-et-Loire]] and Philippe Méaille signed a long term lease agreement for the [[Château de Montsoreau]] to promote contemporary art in the [[Loire Valley]].

==Theoretical installations==

''Art &amp; Language'' and the ''[[Jackson Pollock Bar]]'' collaborated for the first time in January 1995, during the ''Art &amp; Language &amp; Luhmann'' symposium, organized by the Contemporary Social Considerations Institute (Institut für Sozial Gegenwartsfragen) of Freiburg. The 3-day symposium saw the intervention of speakers including [[Catherine David]], who prepared the Documenta X, and [[Peter Weibl]], artist and curator. There was also a theoretical installation of a ''Art &amp; Language'' text produced in playback by the ''Jackson Pollock Bar''. The installation was interpreted by five German actors playing the roles of Jack Tworkow, Philip Guston, Harold Rosenberg, Robert Motherwell and Ad Reinhardt. Using [[lip sync]], the actors used pre-recorded text for a "New Conceptual" conversation. Ever since this collaboration, each new ''Art &amp; Language'' exhibition has been joined by a ''Jackson Pollock Bar'' theoretical installation.

In later Roman versions, only the ridiculous characters read their lines in Oscan, while the others used Latin.

==History==
Atellan Farce evidence is scarce, but surviving fragments point to the comedy genre coming about no earlier than 90 BC.&lt;ref&gt;W.Beare Cambridge University Press, Platus and the Fabula Atellana&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Stock characters==
Some of the hypothesized [[stock character]]s included:
* '''Maccus''' ("The Fool", a hunchbacked, beak nosed character)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commedia Dell'Arte|last=Smith|first=Winifred|publisher=Benjamin Bloom|year=1964|isbn=|location=New York|pages=22|quote=A grotesque statuette representing a beak-nosed, hunchbacked individual, was unearthed at Herculaneum in 1727, which by a slight stretch of imagination could be identified with Maccus|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Punch and Judy: Its Origin and Evolution|last=Byrom|first=Michael|publisher=Shiva Publications|year=1972|isbn=0902982028|location=Aberdeen|pages=4|quote=There was the old man (Pappus), the old woman, the comic slave (Centunculus), the country booby (Buccus), the arrogant soldier (Manducus), the pompous doctor (Dossenus), and the sharp-tongued hooked nosed hunchback (Maccus).|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Buccus''' (the country booby)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Manducus''' (the arrogant soldier)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Pappus''' (the old man)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Centunculus''' (the comic slave) &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Dosseunus''' (the pompous doctor) &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
There has been some debate of these characters connection to similar stock characters in [[Commedia dell'arte]], as well as [[Punch and Judy]]. Atellan Farce and Commedia were both improvised masked comedies. Some Historians argue that the stock characters in Atellan Farce are the beginnings of what would become the stock characters of Commedia dell'arte.

However, the connection of Atellan Farce to Commedia dell'arte and assumption that Atellan Farce is the precursor to Commedia dell'arte is still under debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commedia Dell'Arte|last=Smith|first=Winifred|publisher=Benjamin Blom|year=1964|isbn=|location=New York|pages=21|quote=page 21 Not a little nonsense has been written about the “evolution” of the commedai dell’arte.

==Authorship==
At first, the subjects were decided upon before the performance began and the dialogue was improvised as it proceeded. The performers were the sons of Roman citizens, who did not lose their rights as citizens, and were allowed to serve in the army: professional actors were excluded. The simple prose dialogues were probably varied by songs in the rude Saturnian metre: the language was that of the common people, accompanied by lively gesticulation and movements. They were characterized by coarseness and obscenity.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Atellanae Fabulae|volume=2|page=824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, it is believed that the dictator [[Sulla]] wrote some Atellan Fables. [[Quintus Novius]], who flourished 50 years after the abdication of Sulla, wrote some fifty, including ''Macchus Sexul'' ("Exiled Macchus"), ''Gallinaria'' ("The Henhouse"), ''Surdus'' ("The Deaf One"), ''Vindemiatores'' ("The Harvesters"), and ''Parcus'' (“The Treasurer”).

[[Lucius Pomponius]], of [[Bologna]], is known to have composed a few, including ''Macchus Miles'' ("Macchus the Soldier"),  ''Pytho Gorgonius'', ''Pseudoagamemnon'', ''Bucco Adoptatus'', and ''Aeditumus''. He was also said to have been influenced by the Palliata [[Fabius Dorsennus]]. [[Quintus Novius]] and a "Memmius" were also authors of these comedies; [[Ovid]] and [[Pliny the Younger]] found the work of Memmius to be indecent.

==Controversy and suppression==
{{Citation needed|reason=I have not found any other source other than Wikipedia itself stating this information about the Atellan Farces becoming illegal |date=July 2018}}
Taken from [[Tacitus]] ( [[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]], Book 4): "...after various and often fruitless complaints from the praetors, the emperor [[Tiberius]] finally brought forward a motion about the licentious behavior of the players.  'They had often,' he said.  'Sought to disturb the public peace, and to bring disgrace on private families, and the old Oscan farce, once a wretched amusement for the vulgar, had become at once so indecent and popular, that it must be checked by the Senate's authority'.  The players, upon this, were banished from Italy".

[[Suetonius]] ('' [[The Twelve Caesars#Tiberius|Tiberius]]'', 45, 1) reports that Tiberius himself was mocked for his lecherous habits in an Atellan farce, after which the saying "the old goat lapping up the doe" (''hircum vetulum capreis naturam ligurire'') became popular.

The above passage suggests a growth in popularity or maybe even a revival of these farces, in the 20s AD, that met the disapproval of an older generation of patricians and senators.  Perhaps they were even performed out in public places as an act of direct hostility towards (or a means to mock) specific people or families.  At any rate, these performances eventually became so obnoxious that, in 28 AD, all those who performed in these farces were banished from Italy.

The ''[[Augustan History]]'' records that [[Hadrian]] furnished performances of Atellan Farces at banquets.&lt;ref&gt;''HA'' Hadrian 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bioassay''' is an analytical method to determine concentration or potency of a substance by its effect on living cells or tissues.&lt;ref name="Hoskins 437–464"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoskins|first=W. M.|last2=Craig|first2=R.|date=1962-01-01|title=Uses of Bioassay in Entomology|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.en.07.010162.002253|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=7|issue=1|pages=437–464|doi=10.1146/annurev.en.07.010162.002253|issn=0066-4170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioassays were used to estimate the potency of agents by observing their [[animal testing|effects on living animals]] (in vivo) or tissues (in vitro).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A bioassay experiment can either be qualitative or quantitative, direct or indirect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laska|first=E M|last2=Meisner|first2=M J|date=1987-04-01|title=Statistical Methods and Applications of Bioassay|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.pa.27.040187.002125|journal=Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology|volume=27|issue=1|pages=385–397|doi=10.1146/annurev.pa.27.040187.002125|issn=0362-1642}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the measured response is binary, the assay is qualititative, if not, it is quantitative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is also used to assess the environmental impact and safety of new technologies and facilities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Principle ==
Bioassay is a biochemical test to estimate the relative potency of a sample compound to a standard compound.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoskins 437–464"/&gt; Typical bioassay involves a ''stimulus'' (ex. drugs) applied to a ''subject'' (ex. animals, tissues, plants) and a ''response'' (ex. death) of the subject is triggered and measured.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The intensity of stimulus is varied by doses and depending on this intensity of stimulus, a change/response will be followed by a subject.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== History ==
The first uses of bioassay dates back to as early as the late 19th century, when the foundation of bioassays was laid down by a German physician, Paul Ehrlich.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He introduced the concept of standardization by the reactions of living matter.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Noordwijk|first=Jacobus|title=Bioassays in whole animals|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0731708589800779|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis|volume=7|issue=2|pages=139–145|doi=10.1016/0731-7085(89)80077-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design and Analysis for Bioassays|last=Saha|first=G. M|date=29 November 2002|publisher=Indian Statistical Institute|year=|isbn=|location=Kolkata|pages=61–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; His bioassay on diphtheria antitoxin was the first bioassay to receive recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9682930|title=Analysis of foods and beverages : modern techniques|date=1984|publisher=Academic Press|others=Charalambous, George, 1922-1994.|isbn=0121691608|location=Orlando|oclc=9682930}}&lt;/ref&gt; His use of bioassay was able to disocover that administration of gradually increasing dose of diphteria in animals stimulated production of antiserum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bosch|first=F&amp;egrave;lix|last2=Rosich|first2=Laia|date=2008|title=The Contributions of Paul Ehrlich to Pharmacology: A Tribute on the Occasion of the Centenary of His Nobel Prize|url=https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/149583|journal=Pharmacology|language=english|volume=82|issue=3|pages=171–179|doi=10.1159/000149583|issn=0031-7012|pmc=2790789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the early bioassays consisted of using animals to test carcinogenicity of chemicals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beyer|first=L. A.|last2=Beck|first2=B. D.|last3=Lewandowski|first3=T. A.|date=2011-04-01|title=Historical perspective on the use of animal bioassays to predict carcinogenicity: Evolution in design and recognition of utility|url=https://doi.org/10.3109/10408444.2010.541222|journal=Critical Reviews in Toxicology|volume=41|issue=4|pages=321–338|doi=10.3109/10408444.2010.541222|issn=1040-8444}}&lt;/ref&gt; One well known example is a "canary in the coal mine" experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ei.cornell.edu/toxicology/bioassays/Uses.html|title=Environmental Inquiry - How Are Bioassays Used in the Real World?|website=ei.cornell.edu|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; To test for methane, miners would take methane-sensitive canaries to coal mines to ensure safe air. In 1915, [[Yamagiwa Katsusaburō|Yamaigiwa Katsusaburo]] and Koichi Ichikawa tested the carcinogenicity of coal tar using inner surface of rabbit's ears.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Through 1940s and 1960s, animal bioassay was primarily used to test for toxicity and safety of drugs, food additives and pesticides.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In late 1960s and 1970s, reliance on bioassay increased as the public concern for occupational and environmental hazards increased.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While before this health risks of certain chemicals such as pesticide was tested in animal bioassay, it was still rare and testing was not seen often.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Classifications ==

=== Direct assay ===
- The stimulus/standard sufficiently produces measurable and specific response.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The response must be clear, easily recognized, and directly measured.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Indirect assay based on quantitative response ===
- The relationship between the dose and the response is first ascertained.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Then the dose corresponding to a given response is obtained from the relation for each preparation separately.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Indirect assay based on quantal response ===
- The assay involves 'all or none' response (ex. life or death).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The response is produced by threshold effect.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== [[ELISA]] (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) ===
- quantitative analytical method that measures absorbance of color change from antigen-antibody reaction (ex. Direct, indirect, sandwich, competitive).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aydin|first=Suleyman|title=A short history, principles, and types of ELISA, and our laboratory experience with peptide/protein analyses using ELISA|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S019697811500131X|journal=Peptides|volume=72|pages=4–15|doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2015.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ELISA is used to measure variety of substances in human body from cortisol levels for stress to glucose level for diabetes.

=== Home pregnancy test ===

'''Building design''' refers to the broadly based [[architecture|architectural]], [[Architectural engineering|engineering]] and [[Technology|technical]] applications to the [[design]] of [[building]]s. All building projects require the services of a building designer, typically a licensed [[architect]] or [[structural engineer]]. Smaller, less complicated projects often do not require a licensed professional, and the design of such projects is often undertaken by building designers, draftspersons, [[interior designers]] (for interior fit-outs or renovations), or [[General contractor|contractor]]s. Larger, more complex building projects require the services of many professionals trained in specialist disciplines, usually coordinated by an architect.

== Occupations ==

===Architect===
{{main|Architect}}
An architect is a person trained in the planning, design and supervision of the construction of buildings. Professionally, an architect's decisions affect public safety, and thus an architect must undergo specialized training consisting of advanced education and a practicum (or internship) for practical experience to earn a license to practice architecture. In most of the world's jurisdictions, the professional and commercial use of the term "architect" is legally protected.

===Building engineers===
{{main|Building engineering}}
[[Building engineering]] typically includes the services of [[Electrical engineers|electrical]], [[Mechanical engineers|mechanical]] and [[Structural engineers]].

===Draftsperson (Draughtsman)===
A [[technical drawing|draftsperson]] or [[Documentation|documenter]] is someone who has attained a certificate or [[diploma]] in architectural drafting (or equivalent training), and provides services relating to the preparation of [[Technical drawing|construction documents]] rather than building design. Some draftspersons are employed by architectural design firms and building contractors, while others are self-employed.

===Building designer===
In many places, [[building code]]s and legislation of professions allow persons to design single family residential buildings and in some cases light commercial buildings without an architectural license. As such, "Building designer" is a common designation in the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and elsewhere for someone who offers building design services but is not a licensed architect or engineer.

Anyone may use the title of "building designer" in the broadest sense. In many places, a building designer may achieve certification demonstrating a higher level of training. In the U.S., the ''National Council of Building Designer Certification'' (NCBDC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbdc.com/about.htm National Council of Building Designer Certification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080520084800/http://www.ncbdc.com/about.htm |date=2008-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an offshoot of the ''American Institute of Building Design'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aibd.org/professional_certification.html American Institute of Building Design] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518104652/http://www.aibd.org/professional_certification.html |date=May 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; administers a program leading to the title of ''Certified Professional Building Designer'' (CPBD). In most cases, building designers are trained as [[architectural technologist]]s or draftspersons; they may also be architecture school graduates that have not completed licensing requirements.

Many building designers are known as "residential" or "home designers", since they focus mainly on residential design and remodeling. In the [[U.S. state]] of [[Nevada]], "Residential Designer" is a regulated term for those who are registered as such under Nevada State Board of Architecture, Interior Design and Residential Design, and one may not legally represent oneself in a professional capacity without being currently registered.

In [[Australia]] where use of the term architect and some derivatives is highly restricted but the architectural design of buildings has very few restrictions in place, the term building designer is used extensively by people or design practices who are not registered by the relevant State Board of Architects. In [[Queensland]] the term building design is used in legislation which licences practitioners as part of a broader building industry licensing system. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] there is a registration process for building designers and in other States there is currently no regulation of the profession. A Building Designers Association operates in each state to represent the interests of building designers.

===Building Surveyor (UK)===
[[Chartered Building Surveyor|Building surveyors]] are technically minded general practitioners in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospects.ac.uk/cms/ShowPage/Home_page/Explore_types_of_jobs/Types_of_Job/p!eipaL?idno=121&amp;state=showocc |title=Building surveyor: Job description |publisher=Prospects.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; trained much like [[architectural technologist]]s. In the UK, the knowledge and expertise of the building surveyor is applied to various tasks in the property and construction markets, including building design for smaller residential and light commercial projects. This aspect of the practice is similar to other European occupations, most notably the ''geometra'' in [[Italy]], but also the ''géomètre'' in [[France]], [[Belgium]] and [[Switzerland]].
the building surveyors are also capable on establishment of bills of quantities for the new works and renovation or maintenance or rehabilitation works.

The profession of Building Surveyor does not exist in the US. The title ''Surveyor'' refers almost exclusively to [[Surveying|Land surveyors]]. [[Architect]]s, Building Designers, Residential Designers, Construction Managers, and [[Home Inspector]]s perform some or all of the work of the U.K. Building Surveyor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6400">'''COSMIC''' Functional Size Measurement is a method to measure a standard functional size of a piece of software

'''COSMIC''' may also refer to the Common Software Measurement International Consortium, a voluntary organization that has developed the method and is still expanding its use to more software domains.

{{TOC right}}

== The COSMIC method ==
The COSMIC method defines the principles, rules and a process for measuring a standard functional size of a piece of software. Functional size is a measure of the amount of functionality provided by the software, completely independent of any technical or quality considerations. The generic principles of functional size are described in the [https://www.iso.org/standard/38931.html ISO/IEC 14143] &lt;ref name="ISO/IEC 14143"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/38931.html |title=ISO/IEC 14143 |author=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7  Software and systems engineering |date=2007-02-01 |publisher=International Standards Organization |accessdate=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; standard. This method is also an International Standard by itself. The [https://www.iso.org/standard/33899.html COSMIC] &lt;ref name="COSMIC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/33899.html |title=ISO/IEC 19761 |author=COSMIC |date=2003-02-19 |publisher=International Standards Organization |accessdate=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; standard is the first ''second generation'' implementation of the ISO/IEC 14143 standard. There are also four ''first generation'' implementations:

* ISO/IEC 20968 - Mk II function points
* ISO/IEC 24570 - Nesma function points
* ISO/IEC 29881 - FiSMA function points

== The method in a nutshell ==
The COSMIC method may be used to size software that is dominated by functionality to maintain data, rather than software that predominantly manipulates data. The method can be used in a wide variety of domains, like business applications, real-time software&lt;ref name="real-time"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mathworks.com/videos/design-of-a-functional-size-measurement-tool-for-real-time-embedded-software-requirements-expressed-using-a-simulink-model-92928.html |title=Design of an FSM-tool for real-time embedded software requirements |author=Olivier Guetta, Boubker Bouzid and Jori Le-Bihan (Renault) |date=2012-04-17 |publisher=Mathwork |accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, mobile apps&lt;ref name="mobile"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7000068/ |title=Measure the Functional Size of a Mobile App: Using the COSMIC Functional Size Measurement Method |author=Harold van Heeringen and Edwin van Gorp |date=2015-01-05 |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, infrastructure software and operating systems. The method translates the [[functional requirements|Functional User Requirements]] of the software to four types of base functional components:
* Entry (E)
* Exit (X)
* Read (R)
* Write (W)

A public domain version of the COSMIC Measurement Manual and other technical reports, including translations into other languages can be found at the Knowledge base of [http://cosmic-sizing.org www.cosmic-sizing.org].

== The method structure ==
The foundation of the method is the ISO/IEC 19761 standard, which contains the definitions and basic principles of the method.
The detailed guidelines of the method are laid down in a [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/measurement-manual-v4-0-2/ Measurement Manual] that is independent of any software domain. For different domains underlying guidelines are available:
* [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/guideline-sizing-real-time-software/ Real-time software]
* [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/guideline-sizing-business-application-software-2/ Business Application software]
* [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/guideline-for-sizing-service-oriented-architecture-software/ Service Oriented software]
* [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/guideline-for-sizing-data-warehouse-application-software-2/ Data Warehouse software]

To explain the use of the method a number of case studies have been developed:
* Real-time - [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/automatic-line-switching-2/ Automatic line switching]
* Real-time - [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/3208/ Valve control]

* Business - [https://cosmic-sizing.org/publications/web-advice-module/ Web advice module]

== The organization behind the method ==
The COSMIC organization commenced its work in 1998. Legally COSMIC is an incorporated not for profit organization under Canadian law. The organization grew informally to a global community of professionals. COSMIC is an open and democratic organization. The organization relies and will continue to rely on unpaid efforts by volunteers, who work on various aspects of the method, based on their professional interest.

== Second generation ==
The first generation Functional Size Measurement methods consisted of rules that are based on empirical results. Some define their own terminology, which may have overlap with other terms in software engineering. They work well for the software domains the rules were designed for, but for other domains, the rules need to be altered or extended. Key elements of a second generation Functional Size Measurement method are:
* Adoption of all measurement concepts from the ISO metrology
* A defined measurement unit
* Fully compliant with ISO/IEC 14143
* Preferably domain independent
The COSMIC method is based on principles rather than rules that are domain independent. The principles of the method are based on fundamental software engineering principles, which have been subsequently tested in practice.&lt;ref name="field trials"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ittoday.info/Articles/COSMIC_FPP/COSMIC_FPP.htm |title=COSMIC Full Function Points (FFP) and the Worldwide Field Trials Strategy |author=Alain Abran, Serge Oligny, and Charles Symons |date=2011 |publisher=Auerbach publications |accessdate=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geometry]] and [[linear algebra]], a '''Cartesian tensor''' uses an [[orthonormal basis]] to [[Representation (mathematics)|represent]] a [[tensor]] in a [[Euclidean space]] in the form of components. Converting a tensor's components from one such basis to another is through an [[orthogonal transformation]].

The most familiar coordinate systems are the [[Two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] and [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Cartesian coordinate]] systems. Cartesian tensors may be used with any Euclidean space, or more technically, any finite-dimensional [[vector space]] over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real number]]s that has an [[inner product]].

Use of Cartesian tensors occurs in [[physics]] and [[engineering]], such as with the [[Cauchy stress tensor]] and the [[moment of inertia]] tensor in [[rigid body dynamics]]. Sometimes general [[curvilinear coordinates]] are convenient, as in high-deformation [[continuum mechanics]], or even necessary, as in [[general relativity]]. While orthonormal bases may be found for some such coordinate systems (e.g. [[tangent]] to [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]]), Cartesian tensors may provide considerable simplification for applications in which rotations of rectilinear coordinate axes suffice. The transformation is a [[passive transformation]], since the coordinates are changed and not the physical system.

==Cartesian basis and related terminology==

===Vectors in three dimensions===

In [[three-dimensional space|3d]] [[Euclidean space]], ℝ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[standard basis]] is '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. Each basis vector points along the x-, y-, and z-axes, and the vectors are all [[unit vector]]s (or normalized), so the basis is [[orthonormal]].

Throughout, when referring to [[Cartesian coordinates]] in [[three dimensions]], a right-handed system is assumed and this is much more common than a left-handed system in practice, see [[orientation (vector space)]] for details.
simi
For Cartesian tensors of order 1, a Cartesian vector '''a''' can be written algebraically as a [[linear combination]] of the basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = a_\text{x}\mathbf{e}_\text{x} + a_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} + a_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{z} &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[coordinate vector|coordinate]]s of the vector with respect to the Cartesian basis are denoted ''a''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;. It is common and helpful to display the basis vectors as [[column vector]]s

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_\text{x} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{y} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \,,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{z} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

when we have a [[coordinate vector]] in a column vector representation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_\text{x} \\ a_\text{y} \\ a_\text{z} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

A [[row vector]] representation is also legitimate, although in the context of general curvilinear coordinate systems the row and column vector representations are used separately for specific reasons – see [[Einstein notation]] and [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]] for why.

The term "component" of a vector is ambiguous: it could refer to:

*a specific coordinate of the vector such as ''a''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; (a scalar), and similarly for ''x'' and ''y'', or
*the coordinate scalar-multiplying the corresponding basis vector, in which case the "y-component" of '''a''' is ''a''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; (a vector), and similarly for ''x'' and ''z''.

A more general notation is [[tensor index notation]], which has the flexibility of numerical values rather than fixed coordinate labels. {{anchor|indices replace labels}}&lt;!---PLEASE DON'T DELETE THIS ANCHOR, IT'S USED LATER---&gt;The Cartesian labels are replaced by tensor indices in the basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and coordinates ''A''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; ↦ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In general, the notation '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; refers to ''any'' basis, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the corresponding coordinate system; although here they are restricted to the Cartesian system. Then:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = a_1\mathbf{e}_1 + a_2\mathbf{e}_2 + a_3\mathbf{e}_3 = \sum_{i=1}^3 a_i\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt;

It is standard to use the [[Einstein notation]]—the summation sign for summation over an index that is present exactly twice within a term may be suppressed for notational conciseness:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \sum_{i=1}^3 a_i\mathbf{e}_i \equiv a_i\mathbf{e}_i &lt;/math&gt;

An advantage of the index notation over coordinate-specific notations is the independence of the dimension of the underlying vector space, i.e. the same expression on the right hand side takes the same form in higher dimensions (see below). Previously, the Cartesian labels x, y, z were just labels and ''not'' indices. (It is informal to say "''i'' = x, y, z").

===Second order tensors in three dimensions===

A [[dyadic tensor]] '''T''' is an order 2 tensor formed by the [[tensor product]] &amp;otimes; of two Cartesian vectors '''a''' and '''b''', written '''T''' = '''a''' &amp;otimes; '''b'''. Analogous to vectors, it can be written as a linear combination of the tensor basis {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;otimes; '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;otimes; '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;}}, ..., {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;otimes; '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt;}} (the right hand side of each identity is only an abbreviation, nothing more):

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ccl}
\mathbf{T} &amp; = &amp; \left(a_\text{x}\mathbf{e}_\text{x} + a_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} + a_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\right)\otimes\left(b_\text{x}\mathbf{e}_\text{x} + b_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} + b_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\right) \\
&amp;  &amp; \\
&amp; = &amp; a_\text{x} b_\text{x} \mathbf{e}_\text{x} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{x} + a_\text{x} b_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{x} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{y} + a_\text{x} b_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{x} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{z} \\
&amp; &amp; {} + a_\text{y} b_\text{x}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{x} + a_\text{y} b_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{y} + a_\text{y} b_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{y} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{z} \\
&amp; &amp; {} + a_\text{z} b_\text{x} \mathbf{e}_\text{z} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{x} + a_\text{z} b_\text{y}\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{y} + a_\text{z} b_\text{z}\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{z}  \\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Representing each basis tensor as a matrix:

:&lt;math&gt; 
{\mathbf{e}_\text{x} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{x}} \equiv \mathbf{e}_\text{xx} = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\,,\quad
{\mathbf{e}_\text{x} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{y}} \equiv \mathbf{e}_\text{xy} = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}\,,\cdots \quad {\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \otimes \mathbf{e}_\text{z}} \equiv \mathbf{e}_\text{zz} = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

then '''T''' can be represented more systematically as a matrix:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = \begin{pmatrix} 
a_\text{x} b_\text{x} &amp; a_\text{x} b_\text{y} &amp; a_\text{x} b_\text{z} \\ 
a_\text{y} b_\text{x} &amp; a_\text{y} b_\text{y} &amp; a_\text{y} b_\text{z} \\
a_\text{z} b_\text{x} &amp; a_\text{z} b_\text{y} &amp; a_\text{z} b_\text{z}
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

See [[matrix multiplication#The inner and outer products|matrix multiplication]] for the notational correspondence between matrices and the dot and tensor products.

More generally, whether or not '''T''' is a tensor product of two vectors, it is always a linear combination of the basis tensors with coordinates ''T''&lt;sub&gt;xx&lt;/sub&gt;, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''T''&lt;sub&gt;zz&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ccl}
\mathbf{T}&amp; = &amp; T_\text{xx}\mathbf{e}_\text{xx} + T_\text{xy}\mathbf{e}_\text{xy} + T_\text{xz}\mathbf{e}_\text{xz} \\
&amp; &amp; {} + T_\text{yx}\mathbf{e}_\text{yx} + T_\text{yy}\mathbf{e}_\text{yy} + T_\text{yz}\mathbf{e}_\text{yz} \\
&amp; &amp; {} + T_\text{zx}\mathbf{e}_\text{zx} + T_\text{zy}\mathbf{e}_\text{zy} + T_\text{zz}\mathbf{e}_\text{zz}  
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

while in terms of tensor indices:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T_{ij} \mathbf{e}_{ij} \equiv \sum_{ij} T_{ij} \mathbf{e}_i \otimes \mathbf{e}_j \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and in matrix form:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = \begin{pmatrix} 
T_\text{xx} &amp; T_\text{xy} &amp; T_\text{xz} \\ 
T_\text{yx} &amp; T_\text{yy} &amp; T_\text{yz} \\
T_\text{zx} &amp; T_\text{zy} &amp; T_\text{zz}
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Second order tensors occur naturally in physics and engineering when physical quantities have directional dependence in the system, often in a "stimulus-response" way. This can be mathematically seen through one aspect of tensors - they are [[multilinear function]]s. A second order tensor '''T''' which takes in a vector '''u''' of some magnitude and direction will return a vector '''v'''; of a different magnitude and in a different direction to '''u''', in general. The notation used for [[function (mathematics)|function]]s in [[mathematical analysis]] leads us to write {{nowrap|'''v''' {{=}} '''T'''('''u''')}},&lt;ref name="MTW notation"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Charles W. Misner|C.W. Misner]], [[Kip S. Thorne|K.S. Thorne]], [[John A. Wheeler|J.A. Wheeler]]|title=[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]|page=|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}, used throughout&lt;/ref&gt; while the same idea can be expressed in matrix and index notations&lt;ref name="Kibble notation"&gt;{{cite book|title=classical mechanics|year=1973|publisher=McGraw Hill|edition=2nd|series=European physics series|author=T. W. B. Kibble|isbn=978-0-07-084018-8}}, see Appendix C.&lt;/ref&gt; (including the summation convention), respectively:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} 
v_\text{x} \\ 
v_\text{y} \\
v_\text{z}
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 
T_\text{xx} &amp; T_\text{xy} &amp; T_\text{xz} \\ 
T_\text{yx} &amp; T_\text{yy} &amp; T_\text{yz} \\
T_\text{zx} &amp; T_\text{zy} &amp; T_\text{zz}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 
u_\text{x} \\ 
u_\text{y} \\
u_\text{z}
\end{pmatrix}\,,\quad v_i = T_{ij}u_j &lt;/math&gt;

By "linear", if {{nowrap|'''u''' {{=}} ''ρ'''''r''' + ''σ'''''s'''}} for two scalars ''ρ'' and ''σ'' and vectors '''r''' and '''s''', then in function and index notations:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{T}(\rho\mathbf{r} + \sigma\mathbf{s}) = \rho\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{r}) + \sigma\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{s}) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; v_i = T_{ij}(\rho r_j + \sigma s_j) = \rho T_{ij} r_j + \sigma T_{ij} s_j &lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the matrix notation. The function, matrix, and index notations all mean the same thing. The matrix forms provide a clear display of the components, while the index form allows easier tensor-algebraic manipulation of the formulae in a compact manner. Both provide the physical interpretation of ''directions''; vectors have one direction, while second order tensors connect two directions together. One can associate a tensor index or coordinate label with a basis vector direction.

The use of second order tensors are the minimum to describe changes in magnitudes and directions of vectors, as the [[dot product]] of two vectors is always a scalar, while the [[cross product]] of two vectors is always a pseudovector perpendicular to the plane defined by the vectors, so these products of vectors alone cannot obtain a new vector of any magnitude in any direction. (See also below for more on the dot and cross products). The tensor product of two vectors is a second order tensor, although this has no obvious directional interpretation by itself.

The previous idea can be continued: if '''T''' takes in two vectors '''p''' and '''q''', it will return a scalar ''r''. In function notation we write ''r'' = '''T'''('''p''', '''q'''), while in matrix and index notations (including the summation convention) respectively:

:&lt;math&gt; r = \begin{pmatrix} 
p_\text{x} &amp; 
p_\text{y} &amp;
p_\text{z}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 
T_\text{xx} &amp; T_\text{xy} &amp; T_\text{xz} \\ 
T_\text{yx} &amp; T_\text{yy} &amp; T_\text{yz} \\
T_\text{zx} &amp; T_\text{zy} &amp; T_\text{zz}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} 
q_\text{x} \\ 
q_\text{y} \\
q_\text{z}
\end{pmatrix}\,,\quad r = p_i T_{ij} q_j &lt;/math&gt;

The tensor '''T''' is linear in both input vectors. When vectors and tensors are written without reference to components, and indices are not used, sometimes a dot · is placed where summations over indices (known as [[tensor contraction]]s) are taken. For the above cases:&lt;ref name="MTW notation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kibble notation"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; r = \mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{q}&lt;/math&gt;

motivated by the dot product notation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} \equiv a_i b_i&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, a tensor of order ''m'' which takes in ''n'' vectors (where ''n'' is between 0 and ''m'' inclusive) will return a tensor of order {{nowrap|''m'' − ''n''}}, see [[tensor#As multilinear maps|Tensor: As multilinear maps]] for further generalizations and details. The concepts above also apply to pseudovectors in the same way as for vectors. The vectors and tensors themselves can vary within throughout space, in which case we have [[vector field]]s and [[tensor field]]s, and can also depend on time.

For the electrical conduction example, the index and matrix notations would be:

:&lt;math&gt;J_i = \sigma_{ij}E_j \equiv \sum_{j} \sigma_{ij}E_j &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} J_\text{x} \\ J_\text{y} \\ J_\text{z} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 
\sigma_\text{xx} &amp; \sigma_\text{xy} &amp; \sigma_\text{xz} \\

\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} E_\text{x} \\ E_\text{y} \\ E_\text{z} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

while for the rotational kinetic energy ''T'':

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{1}{2} \omega_i I_{ij} \omega_j \equiv \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} \omega_i I_{ij} \omega_j \,,&lt;/math&gt;

In ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space over the real numbers, ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the standard basis is denoted '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Each basis vector '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; points along the positive ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis, with the basis being orthonormal. Component ''j'' of '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is given by the [[Kronecker delta]]:

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{e}_i)_j = \delta_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

A vector in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; takes the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = a_i\mathbf{e}_i \equiv \sum_i a_i\mathbf{e}_i \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly for the order 2 tensor above, for each vector '''a''' and '''b''' in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = a_i b_j \mathbf{e}_{ij} \equiv \sum_{ij} a_i b_j \mathbf{e}_i \otimes \mathbf{e}_j \,,&lt;/math&gt;

or more generally:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T} = T_{ij} \mathbf{e}_{ij} \equiv \sum_{ij} T_{ij} \mathbf{e}_i \otimes \mathbf{e}_j \,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Transformations of Cartesian vectors (any number of dimensions)==

[[File:Rectangular coordinate system position vector index lowered.svg|thumb|The same [[position vector]] '''x''' represented in two 3d rectangular coordinate systems each with an [[orthonormal basis]], the cuboids illustrate the [[parallelogram law]] for adding vector components.]]

===Meaning of "invariance" under coordinate transformations===

The [[position vector]] '''x''' in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a simple and common example of a vector, and can be represented in ''any'' [[coordinate system]]. Consider the case of [[rectangular coordinate system]]s with orthonormal bases only. It is possible to have a coordinate system with rectangular geometry if the basis vectors are all mutually perpendicular and not normalized, in which case the basis is ortho''gonal'' but not ortho''normal''. However, orthonormal bases are easier to manipulate and are often used in practice. The following results are true for orthonormal bases, not orthogonal ones.

In one rectangular coordinate system, '''x''' as a contravector has coordinates ''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' and basis vectors '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, while as a covector it has coordinates ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and basis covectors '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;, and we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=x^i\mathbf{e}_i\,,\quad \mathbf{x}=x_i\mathbf{e}^i&lt;/math&gt;

In another rectangular coordinate system, '''x''' as a contravector has coordinates ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' and bases {{overline|'''e'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, while as a covector it has coordinates ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and bases {{overline|'''e'''}}&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;, and we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\bar{x}^i\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\,,\quad \mathbf{x}=\bar{x}_i\bar{\mathbf{e}}^i&lt;/math&gt;

Each new coordinate is a function of all the old ones, and vice versa for the [[inverse function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x}{}^i=\bar{x}{}^i\left(x^1,x^2,\cdots\right) \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad x{}^i = x{}^i\left(\bar{x}^1,\bar{x}^2,\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x}{}_i=\bar{x}{}_i\left(x_1,x_2,\cdots\right) \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad x{}_i = x{}_i\left(\bar{x}_1,\bar{x}_2,\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly each new basis vector is a function of all the old ones, and vice versa for the inverse function:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}{}_j = \bar{\mathbf{e}}{}_j\left(\mathbf{e}_1,\mathbf{e}_2\cdots\right) \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \mathbf{e}{}_j = \mathbf{e}{}_j \left(\bar{\mathbf{e}}_1,\bar{\mathbf{e}}_2\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}{}^j = \bar{\mathbf{e}}{}^j\left(\mathbf{e}^1,\mathbf{e}^2\cdots\right) \quad \rightleftharpoons \quad \mathbf{e}{}^j = \mathbf{e}{}^j \left(\bar{\mathbf{e}}^1,\bar{\mathbf{e}}^2\cdots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''i'', ''j''.

A vector is invariant under any change of basis, so if coordinates transform according to a [[transformation matrix]] '''L''', the bases transform according to the [[matrix inverse]] '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and conversely if the coordinates transform according to inverse '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, the bases transform according to the matrix '''L'''. The difference between each of these transformations is shown conventionally through the indices as superscripts for contravariance and subscripts for covariance, and the coordinates and bases are [[linear transformation|linearly transformed]] according to the following rules:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Vector elements
! Contravariant transformation law
! Covariant transformation law
|-
! Coordinates
| &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}^j = x^i (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}})_i{}^j = x^i \mathsf{L}_i{}^j&lt;/math&gt; 
| &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}_j = x_k(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_j{}^k&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! Basis
| &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j = (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_j{}^k\mathbf{e}_k&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}^j = (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}})_i{}^j \mathbf{e}^i = \mathsf{L}_i{}^j \mathbf{e}^i&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! Any vector
| &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}^j \bar{\mathbf{e}}_j = x^i \mathsf{L}_i{}^j (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_j{}^k \mathbf{e}_k = x^i \delta_i{}^k \mathbf{e}_k = x^i \mathbf{e}_i &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}_j \bar{\mathbf{e}}^j = x_i (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_j{}^i \mathsf{L}_k{}^j \mathbf{e}^k = x_i \delta^i{}_k \mathbf{e}^k = x_i \mathbf{e}^i&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

where L&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt; represents the entries of the [[transformation matrix]] (row number is ''i'' and column number is ''j'') and ('''L'''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the entries of the [[inverse matrix]] of the matrix L&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.

If '''L''' is an [[orthogonal transformation]] ([[orthogonal matrix]]), the objects transforming by it are defined as '''Cartesian tensors'''. This geometrically has the interpretation that a rectangular coordinate system is mapped to another rectangular coordinate system, in which the [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] of the vector '''x''' is preserved (and distances are preserved).

The [[determinant]] of '''L''' is det('''L''') = ±1, which corresponds to two types of orthogonal transformation: (+1) for [[rotation (mathematics)|rotations]] and (−1) for [[improper rotation]]s (including [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s).

There are considerable algebraic simplifications, the [[matrix transpose]] is the [[inverse matrix|inverse]] from the definition of an orthogonal transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{\mathrm{T}}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1}\Rightarrow(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_i{}^j=(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{\mathrm{T}})_i{}^j=(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}})^j{}_i=\mathsf{L}^j{}_i&lt;/math&gt;

From the previous table, orthogonal transformations of covectors and contravectors are identical. There is no need to differ between [[raising and lowering indices]], and in this context and applications to physics and engineering the indices are usually all subscripted to remove confusion for [[exponent]]s. All indices will be lowered in the remainder of this article. One can determine the actual raised and lowered indices by considering which quantities are covectors or contravectors, and the relevant transformation rules.

Exactly the same transformation rules apply to any vector '''a''', not only the position vector. If its components ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; do not transform according to the rules, '''a''' is not a vector.

Despite the similarity between the expressions above, for the change of coordinates such as {{nowrap|''{{overline|x}}&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, and the action of a tensor on a vector like {{nowrap|''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''T&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, '''L''' is not a tensor, but '''T''' is. In the change of coordinates, '''L''' is a ''matrix'', used to relate two rectangular coordinate systems with orthonormal bases together. For the tensor relating a vector to a vector, the vectors and tensors throughout the equation all belong to the same coordinate system and basis.

===Derivatives and Jacobian matrix elements===

The entries of '''L''' are [[partial derivative]]s of the new or old coordinates with respect to the old or new coordinates, respectively.

Differentiating ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' with respect to ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\bar{x}_i}{\partial x_k}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_k}(x_j \mathsf{L}_{ji})=\mathsf{L}_{ji}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial x_k}= \delta_{kj}\mathsf{L}_{ji} = \mathsf{L}_{ki}&lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{L}_i{}^j \equiv \mathsf{L}_{ij} = \frac{\partial\bar{x}_j}{\partial x_i} &lt;/math&gt;

is an element of the [[Jacobian matrix]]. There is a (partially mnemonical) correspondence between index positions attached to '''L''' and in the partial derivative: ''i'' at the top and ''j'' at the bottom, in each case, although for Cartesian tensors the indices can be lowered.

Conversely, differentiating ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' with respect to ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial\bar{x}_k}=\frac{\partial}{\partial\bar{x}_k}(\bar{x}_i(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ij})=\frac{\partial\bar{x}_i}{\partial\bar{x}_k}(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ij}=\delta_{ki} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ij}=(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{kj}&lt;/math&gt;
 
so

:&lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_i{}^j \equiv (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ij}=\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial\bar{x}_i}&lt;/math&gt;

is an element of the inverse Jacobian matrix, with a similar index correspondence.
 
Many sources state transformations in terms of the partial derivatives:

{{Equation box 1

\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the explicit matrix equations in 3d are:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}\bar{x}_1\\
\bar{x}_2\\
\bar{x}_3
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial\bar{x}_1}{\partial x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_1}{\partial x_2} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_1}{\partial x_3}\\
\frac{\partial\bar{x}_2}{\partial x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_2}{\partial x_2} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_2}{\partial x_3}\\
\frac{\partial\bar{x}_3}{\partial x_1} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_3}{\partial x_2} &amp; \frac{\partial\bar{x}_3}{\partial x_3}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\
x_2\\
x_3
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

similarly for

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1}\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{\mathrm{T}}\bar{\mathbf{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Projections along coordinate axes===

[[File:Rectangular coordinate systems angles index lowered.svg|500px|thumb|'''Top:''' Angles from the ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes to the ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes. '''Bottom:''' Vice versa.]]

As with all linear transformations, '''L''' depends on the basis chosen. For two orthonormal bases

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j=\mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j=\delta_{ij}\,,\quad\left|\mathbf{e}_i\right|=\left|\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\right|=1\,,&lt;/math&gt;
 
* projecting '''x''' to the ''{{overline|x}}'' axes: &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}_i=\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot\mathbf{x}=\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot x_j\mathbf{e}_j=x_i \mathsf{L}_{ij} \,, &lt;/math&gt;
* projecting '''x''' to the ''x'' axes: &lt;math&gt;x_i=\mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{e}_i\cdot\bar{x}_j\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j=\bar{x}_j(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ji} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the components reduce to [[direction cosine]]s between the ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{L}_{ij} = \bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j=\cos\theta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ij} = \mathbf{e}_i\cdot\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j=\cos\theta_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''θ&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the angles between the ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes. In general, ''θ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not equal to ''θ&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;'', because for example ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; are two different angles.

The transformation of coordinates can be written:

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c}
\bar{x}_j = x_i \left(\bar{\mathbf{e}}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j \right) = x_i\cos\theta_{ij}\\
\upharpoonleft\downharpoonright\\
x_j = \bar{x}_i \left( \mathbf{e}_i\cdot\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j \right) = \bar{x}_i\cos\theta_{ji}
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border = 1
|border colour = black
|background colour=white}}

and the explicit matrix equations in 3d are:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
\bar{x}_1\\
\bar{x}_2\\
\bar{x}_3
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\bar{\mathbf{e}}_1\cdot\mathbf{e}_1 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_1\cdot\mathbf{e}_2 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_1\cdot\mathbf{e}_3\\
\bar{\mathbf{e}}_2\cdot\mathbf{e}_1 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_2\cdot\mathbf{e}_2 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_2\cdot\mathbf{e}_3\\
\bar{\mathbf{e}}_3\cdot\mathbf{e}_1 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_3\cdot\mathbf{e}_2 &amp; \bar{\mathbf{e}}_3\cdot\mathbf{e}_3
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\
x_2\\
x_3
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\cos\theta_{11} &amp; \cos\theta_{12} &amp; \cos\theta_{13}\\
\cos\theta_{21} &amp; \cos\theta_{22} &amp; \cos\theta_{23}\\
\cos\theta_{31} &amp; \cos\theta_{32} &amp; \cos\theta_{33}
\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\
x_2\\
x_3
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

similarly for

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1}\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{\mathrm{T}}\bar{\mathbf{x}}&lt;/math&gt;

The geometric interpretation is the ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' components equal to the sum of projecting the ''x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' components onto the ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' axes.

The numbers '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;sdot;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; arranged into a matrix would form a [[symmetric matrix]] (a matrix equal to its own transpose) due to the symmetry in the dot products, in fact it is the [[metric tensor]] '''g'''. By contrast '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;sdot;{{overline|'''e'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; or {{overline|'''e'''}}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;sdot;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; do ''not'' form symmetric matrices in general, as displayed above. Therefore, while the '''L''' matrices are still orthogonal, they are not symmetric.

Apart from a rotation about any one axis, in which the ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''{{overline|x}}&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for some ''i'' coincide, the angles are not the same as [[Euler angle]]s, and so the '''L''' matrices are not the same as the [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]].

==Transformation of the dot and cross products (three dimensions only)==

The [[dot product]] and [[cross product]] occur very frequently, in applications of vector analysis to physics and engineering, examples include:

*[[power (physics)|power]] transferred ''P'' by an object exerting a force '''F''' with velocity '''v''' along a straight-line path: 
::&lt;math&gt;P = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt;
*tangential [[velocity]] '''v''' at a point '''x''' of a rotating [[rigid body]] with [[angular velocity]] '''ω''': 
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;
*[[potential energy]] ''U'' of a [[magnetic dipole]] of [[magnetic moment]] '''m''' in a uniform external [[magnetic field]] '''B''': 
::&lt;math&gt;U=-\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;
*[[angular momentum]] '''J''' for a particle with [[position vector]] '''r''' and [[momentum]] '''p''': 
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{r}\times \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;
*[[torque]] '''τ''' acting on an [[electric dipole]] of [[electric dipole moment]] '''p''' in a uniform external [[electric field]] '''E''': 
::&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{p}\times\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;
*induced surface [[current density]] '''j'''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; in a magnetic material of [[magnetization]] '''M''' on a surface with [[unit normal]] '''n''': 
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{j}_\mathrm{S} = \mathbf{M} \times \mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;

How these products transform under orthogonal transformations is illustrated below.

===Dot product, Kronecker delta, and metric tensor===

The [[dot product]] &amp;sdot; of each possible pairing of the basis vectors follows from the basis being orthonormal. For perpendicular pairs we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{cccc}
\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y} &amp; = \mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z} &amp; =\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\\
\mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x} &amp; =\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y} &amp; =\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z} &amp; =0
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

while for parallel pairs we have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x}=\mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y}=\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z}=1 .&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing Cartesian labels by index notation as shown [[#indices replace labels|above]], these results can be summarized by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j = \delta_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the components of the [[Kronecker delta]]. The Cartesian basis can be used to represent ''δ'' in this way.

In addition, each [[metric tensor]] component ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' with respect to any basis is the dot product of a pairing of basis vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = \mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j .&lt;/math&gt;

For the Cartesian basis the components arranged into a matrix are:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g} = \begin{pmatrix} 
g_\text{xx} &amp; g_\text{xy} &amp; g_\text{xz} \\
g_\text{yx} &amp; g_\text{yy} &amp; g_\text{zz} \\
g_\text{zx} &amp; g_\text{zy} &amp; g_\text{zz} \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 
\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \\
\mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{y}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \\
\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{x} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{y} &amp; \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\cdot\mathbf{e}_\text{z} \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so are the simplest possible for the metric tensor, namely the [[identity matrix|''δ'']]:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij} = \delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

This is ''not'' true for general bases: [[orthogonal coordinates]] have [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]] metrics containing various scale factors (i.e. not necessarily 1), while general [[curvilinear coordinates]] could also have nonzero entries for off-diagonal components.

The dot product of two vectors '''a''' and '''b''' transforms according to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} = \bar{a}_j \bar{b}_j = a_i \mathsf{L}_{ij} b_k(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{jk} = a_i \delta_i{}_k b_k = a_i b_i &lt;/math&gt;

which is intuitive, since the dot product of two vectors is a single scalar independent of any coordinates. This also applies more generally to any coordinate systems, not just rectangular ones; the dot product in one coordinate system is the same in any other.

===Cross and product, Levi-Civita symbol, and pseudovectors===

For the [[cross product]] × of two vectors, the results are (almost) the other way round. Again, assuming a right-handed 3d Cartesian coordinate system, [[cyclic permutation]]s in perpendicular directions yield the next vector in the cyclic collection of vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{y} = \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{y}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{z} = \mathbf{e}_\text{x}\,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{x} = \mathbf{e}_\text{y}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\text{y}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{x} = - \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{y} = -\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\,\quad \mathbf{e}_\text{x}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{z} = -\mathbf{e}_\text{y}&lt;/math&gt;

while parallel vectors clearly vanish:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_\text{x}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{x}=\mathbf{e}_\text{y}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{y}=\mathbf{e}_\text{z}\times\mathbf{e}_\text{z} = \boldsymbol{0}&lt;/math&gt;

and replacing Cartesian labels by index notation as [[#indices replace labels|above]], these can be summarized by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_i\times\mathbf{e}_j=\left [ \begin{array}{cc}
+\mathbf{e}_k &amp; \text{cyclic permutations: } (i,j,k) = (1,2,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2) \\
-\mathbf{e}_k &amp; \text{anticyclic permutations: } (i,j,k) = (2,1,3), (3,2,1), (1,3,2) \\
\boldsymbol{0} &amp; i=j
\end{array}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' are indices which take values 1, 2, 3. It follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{e}_k\cdot\mathbf{e}_i\times\mathbf{e}_j}=\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
+1 &amp; \text{cyclic permutations: } (i,j,k) = (1,2,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2) \\
-1 &amp; \text{anticyclic permutations: } (i,j,k) = (2,1,3), (3,2,1), (1,3,2) \\
0 &amp; i=j\text{ or }j=k\text{ or }k=i
\end{array}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

These permutation relations and their corresponding values are important, and there is an object coinciding with this property: the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], denoted by ''ε''. The Levi-Civita symbol entries can be represented by the Cartesian basis:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijk} = \mathbf{e}_i\cdot \mathbf{e}_j\times\mathbf{e}_k&lt;/math&gt;

which geometrically corresponds to the [[volume]] of a [[cube]] spanned by the orthonormal basis vectors, with sign indicating [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]] (and ''not'' a "positive or negative volume"). Here, the orientation is fixed by ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;123&lt;/sub&gt; = +1, for a right-handed system. A left-handed system would fix ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;123&lt;/sub&gt; = −1 or equivalently ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;321&lt;/sub&gt; = +1.

The [[scalar triple product]] can now be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = c_i\mathbf{e}_i \cdot a_j\mathbf{e}_j \times b_k\mathbf{e}_k = \varepsilon_{ijk} c_i a_j b_k  &lt;/math&gt;

with the geometric interpretation of volume (of the [[parallelepiped]] spanned by '''a''', '''b''', '''c''') and algebraically is a [[determinant]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|edition=2nd|author1=M. R. Spiegel |author2=S. Lipcshutz |author3=D. Spellman | title=Vector analysis| series=Schaum’s Outlines|publisher=McGraw Hill |page=23|year=2009 | isbn=978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} \cdot \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{vmatrix} c_\text{x} &amp; a_\text{x} &amp; b_\text{x} \\ c_\text{y} &amp; a_\text{y} &amp; b_\text{y} \\ c_\text{z} &amp; a_\text{z} &amp; b_\text{z} \end{vmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

This in turn can be used to rewrite the [[cross product]] of two vectors as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ll}
&amp; (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})_i = {\mathbf{e}_i \cdot \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}} = \varepsilon_{\ell jk} {(\mathbf{e}_i)}_\ell a_j b_k = \varepsilon_{\ell jk} \delta_{i \ell} a_j b_k = \varepsilon_{ijk} a_j b_k \\
\Rightarrow &amp; {\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}} = (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})_i \mathbf{e}_i = \varepsilon_{ijk} a_j b_k \mathbf{e}_i 
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Contrary to its appearance, the Levi-Civita symbol is ''not a tensor'', but a [[pseudotensor]], the components transform according to:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\varepsilon}_{pqr} = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \varepsilon_{ijk} \mathsf{L}_{ip}\mathsf{L}_{jq}\mathsf{L}_{kr} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the transformation of the cross product of '''a''' and '''b''' is:
&lt;!---PLEASE LEAVE THE SPACES \;\; FOR CLARITY, AND LEAVE IN ALL THE STEPS - CLARITY IS NOT "TEXTBOOKY" - THANKS---&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(\bar{\mathbf{a}} \times \bar{\mathbf{b}})_i &amp; = \bar{\varepsilon}_{ijk} \bar{a}_j \bar{b}_k \\
&amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \;\; \varepsilon_{pqr} \mathsf{L}_{pi}\mathsf{L}_{qj} \mathsf{L}_{rk} \;\; a_m \mathsf{L}_{mj} \;\; b_n \mathsf{L}_{nk} \\
&amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \;\; \varepsilon_{pqr} \;\; \mathsf{L}_{pi} \;\; \mathsf{L}_{qj} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{jm} \;\; \mathsf{L}_{rk} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{kn} \;\; a_m \;\; b_n \\
&amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \;\; \varepsilon_{pqr} \;\; \mathsf{L}_{pi}  \;\;  \delta_{qm} \;\; \delta_{rn} \;\; a_m \;\; b_n \\
&amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \;\; \mathsf{L}_{pi}  \;\;  \varepsilon_{pqr} a_q b_r \\
&amp; = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \;\; (\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b})_p  \mathsf{L}_{pi}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and so '''a''' × '''b''' transforms as a [[pseudovector]], because of the determinant factor.

The [[tensor index notation]] applies to any object which has entities that form [[multidimensional array]]s – not everything with indices is a tensor by default. Instead, tensors are defined by how their coordinates and basis elements change under a transformation from one coordinate system to another.

Note the cross product of two vectors is a pseudovector, while the cross product of a pseudovector with a vector is another vector.

===Applications of the ''δ'' tensor and ''ε'' pseudotensor===

Other identities can be formed from the ''δ'' tensor and ''ε'' pseudotensor, a notable and very useful identity is one that converts two Levi-Civita symbols adjacently contracted over two indices into an antisymmetrized combination of Kronecker deltas:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijk}\varepsilon_{pqk} = \delta_{ip}\delta_{jq} - \delta_{iq}\delta_{jp} &lt;/math&gt;

The index forms of the dot and cross products, together with this identity, greatly facilitate the manipulation and derivation of other [[vector calculus identities|identities in vector calculus]] and algebra, which in turn are used extensively in physics and engineering. For instance, it is clear the dot and cross products are distributive over vector addition:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot(\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{c} ) =  a_i ( b_i + c_i ) =  a_i b_i + a_i c_i = \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{c} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}\times(\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}) = \mathbf{e}_i\varepsilon_{ijk} a_j ( b_k + c_k ) = \mathbf{e}_i \varepsilon_{ijk} a_j b_k + \mathbf{e}_i \varepsilon_{ijk} a_j c_k = \mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b} + \mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt;

without resort to any geometric constructions - the derivation in each case is a quick line of algebra. Although the procedure is less obvious, the vector triple product can also be derived. Rewriting in index notation:

:&lt;math&gt; \left[ \mathbf{a}\times(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{c})\right]_i = \varepsilon_{ijk} a_j ( \varepsilon_{k \ell m} b_\ell c_m ) = (\varepsilon_{ijk} \varepsilon_{k \ell m} ) a_j b_\ell c_m &lt;/math&gt;

and because cyclic permutations of indices in the ''ε'' symbol does not change its value, cyclically permuting indices in ''ε&lt;sub&gt;k{{ell}}m&lt;/sub&gt;'' to obtain ''ε&lt;sub&gt;{{ell}}mk&lt;/sub&gt;'' allows us to use the above ''δ''-''ε'' identity to convert the ''ε'' symbols into ''δ'' tensors:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\left[ \mathbf{a}\times(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{c})\right]_i &amp; = ( \delta_{i\ell} \delta_{jm} - \delta_{im} \delta_{j\ell} ) a_j b_\ell c_m \\
&amp; = \delta_{i\ell} \delta_{jm} a_j b_\ell c_m - \delta_{im} \delta_{j\ell} a_j b_\ell c_m \\ 
&amp; = a_j b_i c_j -  a_j b_j c_i \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

thusly:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\times(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{c}) = (\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{c})\mathbf{b} -  (\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt;

Note this is antisymmetric in '''b''' and '''c''', as expected from the left hand side. Similarly, via index notation or even just cyclically relabelling '''a''', '''b''', and '''c''' in the previous result and taking the negative:

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{a}\times \mathbf{b})\times\mathbf{c} = (\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{a})\mathbf{b} - (\mathbf{c}\cdot\mathbf{b})\mathbf{a} &lt;/math&gt;

and the difference in results show that the cross product is not associative. More complex identities, like quadruple products;

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{a}\times \mathbf{b})\cdot(\mathbf{c}\times\mathbf{d}), \quad (\mathbf{a}\times \mathbf{b})\times(\mathbf{c}\times\mathbf{d}) ,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

and so on, can be derived in a similar manner.

==Transformations of Cartesian tensors (any number of dimensions)==

Tensors are defined as quantities which transform in a certain way under linear transformations of coordinates.

===Second order===
Text below contradics introduced above contravariant and covariant vectors (tensors)

Let '''a''' = ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and '''b''' = ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be two vectors, so that they transform according to ''{{overline|a}}&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''{{overline|b}}&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Taking the tensor product gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}=a_i\mathbf{e}_i\otimes b_j\mathbf{e}_j=a_i b_j\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt;

then applying the transformation to the components

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{a}_p\bar{b}_q= a_i \mathsf{L}_i{}_p b_j \mathsf{L}_j{}_q = \mathsf{L}_i{}_p\mathsf{L}_j{}_q a_i b_j &lt;/math&gt;

and to the bases

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_p\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_q = (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{pi}\mathbf{e}_i\otimes(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{qj}\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j = (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{pi}(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{qj}\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j = \mathsf{L}_{ip} \mathsf{L}_{jq} \mathbf{e}_i\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_j&lt;/math&gt;

gives the transformation law of an order-2 tensor. The tensor '''a'''&amp;otimes;'''b''' is invariant under this transformation:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{cl}
\bar{a}_p\bar{b}_q\bar{\mathbf{e}}_p\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_q &amp; = \mathsf{L}_{kp} \mathsf{L}_{\ell q} a_k b_{\ell} \, (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{pi} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{qj} \mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j \\
 &amp; = \mathsf{L}_{kp} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{pi} \mathsf{L}_{\ell q} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{q j} \, a_k b_{\ell} \mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j \\
 &amp; = \delta_k{}_i \delta_{\ell j}  \, a_k b_{\ell} \mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j \\
 &amp; = a_ib_j\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, for any order-2 tensor

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}=R_{ij}\mathbf{e}_i\otimes\mathbf{e}_j\,,&lt;/math&gt;

the components transform according to;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{R}_{pq}=\mathsf{L}_i{}_p\mathsf{L}_j{}_q R_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;,

and the basis transforms by:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_p\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_q = (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{ip}\mathbf{e}_i\otimes (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{jq}\mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt;

If '''R''' does not transform according to this rule - whatever quantity '''R''' may be, it's not an order 2 tensor.

===Any order===

More generally, for any order ''p'' tensor

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T_{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_p} \mathbf{e}_{j_1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j_2}\otimes\cdots\mathbf{e}_{j_p}&lt;/math&gt;

the components transform according to;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{T}_{j_1j_2\cdots j_p} = \mathsf{L}_{i_1 j_1} \mathsf{L}_{i_2 j_2}\cdots \mathsf{L}_{i_p j_p} T_{i_1 i_2\cdots i_p}&lt;/math&gt;

and the basis transforms by:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_{j_1}\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_{j_2}\cdots\otimes\bar{\mathbf{e}}_{j_p}=(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{j_1 i_1}\mathbf{e}_{i_1}\otimes(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{j_2 i_2}\mathbf{e}_{i_2}\cdots\otimes(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{j_p i_p}\mathbf{e}_{i_p}&lt;/math&gt;

For a [[pseudotensor]] '''S''' of order ''p'', the components transform according to;

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{S}_{j_1j_2\cdots j_p} = \det(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}) \mathsf{L}_{i_1 j_1} \mathsf{L}_{i_2 j_2}\cdots \mathsf{L}_{i_p j_p} S_{i_1 i_2\cdots i_p}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Pseudovectors as antisymmetric second order tensors==

The antisymmetric nature of the cross product can be recast into a tensorial form as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=classical mechanics|year=1973|publisher=McGraw Hill|edition=2nd|series=European physics series|pages=234–235|author=T. W. B. Kibble|isbn=978-0-07-084018-8}}, see Appendix C.&lt;/ref&gt; Let '''c''' be a vector, '''a''' be a pseudovector, '''b''' be another vector, and '''T''' be a second order tensor such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{T}\cdot\mathbf{b} &lt;/math&gt;

As the cross product is linear in '''a''' and '''b''', the components of '''T''' can be found by inspection, and they are:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - a_\text{z} &amp; a_\text{y} \\
a_\text{z} &amp; 0 &amp; - a_\text{x} \\
- a_\text{y} &amp; a_\text{x} &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so the pseudovector '''a''' can be written as an antisymmetric tensor. This transforms as a tensor, not a pseudotensor. For the mechanical example above for the tangential velocity of a rigid body, given by {{nowrap|'''v''' {{=}} '''ω''' × '''x'''}}, this can be rewritten as {{nowrap|'''v''' {{=}} '''Ω''' · '''x'''}} where '''Ω''' is the tensor corresponding to the pseudovector '''ω''':

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - \omega_\text{z} &amp; \omega_\text{y} \\
\omega_\text{z} &amp; 0 &amp; - \omega_\text{x} \\
- \omega_\text{y} &amp; \omega_\text{x} &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

For an example in [[electromagnetism]], while the [[electric field]] '''E''' is a [[vector field]], the [[magnetic field]] '''B''' is a pseudovector field. These fields are defined from the [[Lorentz force]] for a particle of [[electric charge]] ''q'' traveling at velocity '''v''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}) = q(\mathbf{E} - \mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt;

and considering the second term containing the cross product of a pseudovector '''B''' and velocity vector '''v''', it can be written in matrix form, with '''F''', '''E''', and '''v''' as column vectors and '''B''' as an antisymmetric matrix:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix}
F_\text{x} \\
F_\text{y} \\
F_\text{z} \\
\end{pmatrix} = q\begin{pmatrix}
E_\text{x} \\
E_\text{y} \\
E_\text{z} \\
\end{pmatrix} - q \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - B_\text{z} &amp; B_\text{y} \\
B_\text{z} &amp; 0 &amp; - B_\text{x} \\
- B_\text{y} &amp; B_\text{x} &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
v_\text{x} \\
v_\text{y} \\
v_\text{z} \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If a pseudovector is explicitly given by a cross product of two vectors (as opposed to entering the cross product with another vector), then such pseudovectors can also be written as antisymmetric tensors of second order, with each entry a component of the cross product. The angular momentum of a classical pointlike particle orbiting about an axis, defined by {{nowrap|'''J''' {{=}} '''x''' × '''p'''}}, is another example of a pseudovector, with corresponding antisymmetric tensor:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - J_\text{z} &amp; J_\text{y} \\
J_\text{z} &amp; 0 &amp; - J_\text{x} \\
- J_\text{y} &amp; J_\text{x} &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; - (x p_\text{y} - y p_\text{x}) &amp; (z p_\text{x} - x p_\text{z}) \\
(x p_\text{y} - y p_\text{x}) &amp; 0 &amp; - (y p_\text{z} - z p_\text{y}) \\
- (z p_\text{x} - x p_\text{z}) &amp; (y p_\text{z} - z p_\text{y}) &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Although Cartesian tensors do not occur in the theory of relativity; the tensor form of orbital angular momentum '''J''' enters the spacelike part of the [[relativistic angular momentum]] tensor, and the above tensor form of the magnetic field '''B''' enters the spacelike part of the [[electromagnetic tensor]].

==Vector and tensor calculus==

It should be emphasized the following formulae are only so simple in Cartesian coordinates - in general curvilinear coordinates there are factors of the metric and its determinant - see [[tensors in curvilinear coordinates]] for more general analysis.

===Vector calculus===

Following are the differential operators of [[vector calculus]]. Throughout, left Φ('''r''', ''t'') be a [[scalar field]], and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r},t) = A_\text{x}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{x} + A_\text{y}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{y} + A_\text{z}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r},t) = B_\text{x}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{x} + B_\text{y}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{y} + B_\text{z}(\mathbf{r},t)\mathbf{e}_\text{z}&lt;/math&gt;

be [[vector field]]s, in which all scalar and vector fields are functions of the [[position vector]] '''r''' and time ''t''.

The [[gradient]] operator in Cartesian coordinates is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla = \mathbf{e}_\text{x}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} +  \mathbf{e}_\text{y}\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \mathbf{e}_\text{z}\frac{\partial}{\partial z} &lt;/math&gt;

and in index notation, this is usually abbreviated in various ways:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_i \equiv \partial_i \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} &lt;/math&gt;

This operator acts on a scalar field Φ to obtain the vector field directed in the maximum rate of increase of Φ:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla\Phi\right)_i = \nabla_i \Phi &lt;/math&gt;

The index notation for the dot and cross products carries over to the differential operators of vector calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|edition=2nd|author1=M. R. Spiegel |author2=S. Lipcshutz |author3=D. Spellman | title=Vector analysis| series=Schaum’s Outlines|publisher=McGraw Hill |page=197| year=2009 | isbn=978-0-07-161545-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[directional derivative]] of a scalar field Φ is the rate of change of Φ along some direction vector '''a''' (not necessarily a [[unit vector]]), formed out of the components of '''a''' and the gradient:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\cdot(\nabla\Phi) = a_j (\nabla\Phi)_j &lt;/math&gt;

The [[divergence]] of a vector field '''A''' is:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot\mathbf{A} = \nabla_i A_i &lt;/math&gt;

Note the interchange of the components of the gradient and vector field yields a different differential operator

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\cdot\nabla =  A_i \nabla_i &lt;/math&gt;

which could act on scalar or vector fields. In fact, if '''A''' is replaced by the [[velocity field]] '''u'''('''r''', ''t'') of a fluid, this is a term in the [[material derivative]] (with many other names) of [[continuum mechanics]], with another term being the partial time derivative:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{D}{D t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla&lt;/math&gt;

which usually acts on the velocity field leading to the non-linearity in the [[Navier-Stokes equations]].

As for the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of a vector field '''A''', this can be defined as a pseudovector field by means of the ''ε'' symbol:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla\times\mathbf{A}\right)_i = \varepsilon_{ijk} \nabla_j A_k &lt;/math&gt;

which is only valid in three dimensions, or an antisymmetric tensor field of second order via antisymmetrization of indices, indicated by delimiting the antisymmetrized indices by square brackets (see [[Ricci calculus]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\nabla\times\mathbf{A}\right)_{ij} = \nabla_i A_j - \nabla_j A_i = 2\nabla_{[i} A_{j]}&lt;/math&gt;

which is valid in any number of dimensions. In each case, the order of the gradient and vector field components should not be interchanged as this would result in a different differential operator:

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{ijk} A_j \nabla_k &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_i \nabla_j - A_j \nabla_i = 2 A_{[i} \nabla_{j]} &lt;/math&gt;

which could act on scalar or vector fields.

Finally, the [[Laplacian operator]] is defined in two ways, the divergence of the gradient of a scalar field Φ:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot(\nabla \Phi) = \nabla_i (\nabla_i \Phi) &lt;/math&gt;

or the square of the gradient operator, which acts on a scalar field Φ or a vector field '''A''':

:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla\cdot\nabla) \Phi = (\nabla_i \nabla_i) \Phi &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla\cdot\nabla) \mathbf{A} = (\nabla_i \nabla_i) \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;

In physics and engineering, the gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplacian operator arise inevitably in [[fluid mechanics]], [[Newtonian gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], [[heat conduction]], and even [[quantum mechanics]].

Vector calculus identities can be derived in a similar way to those of vector dot and cross products and combinations. For example, in three dimensions, the curl of a cross product of two vector fields '''A''' and '''B''':

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left[\nabla\times(\mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{B})\right]_i &amp; = \varepsilon_{ijk} \nabla_j (\varepsilon_{k\ell m} A_\ell B_m) \\
&amp; = (\varepsilon_{ijk} \varepsilon_{\ell m k} ) \nabla_j (A_\ell B_m) \\
&amp; = (\delta_{i\ell}\delta_{jm} - \delta_{im}\delta_{j\ell}) (B_m \nabla_j A_\ell + A_\ell \nabla_j B_m ) \\
&amp; = (B_j \nabla_j A_i  + A_i \nabla_j B_j ) - (B_i \nabla_j A_j + A_j \nabla_j B_i ) \\
&amp; = (B_j \nabla_j)A_i  + A_i(\nabla_j B_j ) - B_i (\nabla_j A_j ) - (A_j \nabla_j) B_i \\
&amp; = \left[(\mathbf{B} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{A}  + \mathbf{A}(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{B}) - \mathbf{B}(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{A} ) - (\mathbf{A}\cdot \nabla) \mathbf{B} \right]_i \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[product rule]] was used, and throughout the differential operator was not interchanged with '''A''' or '''B'''. Thus:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times(\mathbf{A}\times\mathbf{B}) = (\mathbf{B} \cdot \nabla)\mathbf{A}  + \mathbf{A}(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{B}) - \mathbf{B}(\nabla\cdot \mathbf{A} ) - (\mathbf{A}\cdot \nabla) \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;

===Tensor calculus===

One can continue the operations on tensors of higher order. Let '''T''' = '''T'''('''r''', ''t'') denote a second order tensor field, again dependent on the position vector '''r''' and time ''t''.

For instance, the gradient of a vector field in two equivalent notations ("dyadic" and "tensor", respectively) is:

:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla \mathbf{A})_{ij} \equiv (\nabla \otimes \mathbf{A})_{ij} = \nabla_i A_j &lt;/math&gt;

which is a tensor field of second order.

The divergence of a tensor is:

:&lt;math&gt;(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{T})_j = \nabla_i T_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;

which is a vector field. This arises in continuum mechanics in [[Continuum mechanics#Governing equations|Cauchy's laws of motion]] - the divergence of the Cauchy stress tensor '''σ''' is a vector field, related to [[body force]]s acting on the fluid.

==Difference from the standard tensor calculus==

Cartesian tensors are as in [[tensor algebra]], but [[Euclidean space#Euclidean structure|Euclidean structure]] of and restriction of the basis brings some simplifications compared to the general theory.

The general tensor algebra consists of general [[mixed tensor]]s of type (''p'', ''q''):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T} = T_{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_q}^{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_p} \mathbf{e}_{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_p}^{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_q} &lt;/math&gt;

with basis elements:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_p}^{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_q} = \mathbf{e}_{i_1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{i_2}\otimes\cdots\mathbf{e}_{i_p}\otimes\mathbf{e}^{j_1}\otimes\mathbf{e}^{j_2}\otimes\cdots\mathbf{e}^{j_q}&lt;/math&gt;

the components transform according to:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{T}_{\ell_1 \ell_2 \cdots \ell_q}^{k_1 k_2 \cdots k_p} = \mathsf{L}_{i_1}{}^{k_1} \mathsf{L}_{i_2}{}^{k_2} \cdots \mathsf{L}_{i_p}{}^{k_p} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{\ell_1}{}^{j_1}(\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{\ell_2}{}^{j_2} \cdots (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{\ell_q}{}^{j_q} T_{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_q}^{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_p}&lt;/math&gt;

as for the bases:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{e}}_{k_1 k_2 \cdots k_p}^{\ell_1 \ell_2 \cdots \ell_q} = (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{k_1}{}^{i_1} (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{k_2}{}^{i_2} \cdots (\boldsymbol{\mathsf{L}}^{-1})_{k_p}{}^{i_p} \mathsf{L}_{j_1}{}^{\ell_1} \mathsf{L}_{j_2}{}^{\ell_2} \cdots \mathsf{L}_{j_q}{}^{\ell_q} \mathbf{e}_{i_1 i_2 \cdots i_p}^{j_1 j_2 \cdots j_q}&lt;/math&gt;

For Cartesian tensors, only the order {{nowrap|''p'' + ''q''}} of the tensor matters in a Euclidean space with an orthonormal basis, and all {{nowrap|''p'' + ''q''}} indices can be lowered.  A Cartesian basis does not exist unless the vector space has a positive-definite metric, and thus cannot be used in [[special relativity|relativistic]] contexts.

==History==

[[Dyadic tensor]]s were historically the first approach to formulating second-order tensors, similarly triadic tensors for third-order tensors, and so on. Cartesian tensors use [[tensor index notation]], in which the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|variance]] may be glossed over and is often ignored, since the components remain unchanged by [[raising and lowering indices]].

The '''Center for Jewish Studies Shanghai''' (CJSS, Simplified: 上海犹太研究中心, Traditional: 上海猶太研究中心, Pinyin: ''Shànghǎi Yóutài Yánjiūzhōngxīn'') was established in 1988. It is a department of the [[Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences]]. Under the leadership of Dean [[Pan Guang]] CJSS has become the most influential research institute in China studying Judaism and Israeli affairs. 

The Center focuses its research on the history of the "Shanghai Jews" ([[the Holocaust]] refugees during [[World War II]]), the remnants of Jewish communities in China (the largest of which are in [[Tianjin]], [[Harbin]] and [[Kaifeng]]) and political studies on the Near East. Amongst the publications of the Center are ''The Jews of China'', ''The Jewish Civilization'', ''The Revitalization of the Jewish People'' and ''Jews in China: Legends, History and New Perspectives''. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311193059/http://www.cjss.org.cn/new_page_7i.htm]

The Center has organized several national as well as international academic conferences along with so-called Rickshaw Reunions (reunions of Holocaust refugees who survived the Holocaust in [[Shanghai#During World War II|Shanghai]]). The Center has been visited by prominent guests, amongst them [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Ehud Olmert]], [[Gerhard Schröder]], [[Ariel Sharon]], [[Hillary Clinton]] and then [[Austria]]n President [[Thomas Klestil]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070311045108/http://www.cjss.org.cn/new_page_3.htm]

Since 2006 the CJSS receives each year an [[Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service|Austrian Holocaust Memorial Servant]] from the [[Austrian Service Abroad]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16682">In keeping with the [[Paris Principles]] definition of a child soldier, the Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative defines a ''child pirate''' as any person below 18 years of age who is or who has been recruited or used by a [[pirate]] gang in any capacity, including children - boys and/or girls - used as gunmen in boarding parties, hostage guards, negotiators, ship captains, messengers, spies or for sexual purposes, whether at sea or on land.  It does not only refer to a child who is taking or has taken a direct part in kinetic criminal operations.

Children may volunteer to participate in piratical activities (usually on account of socioeconomic desperation, familial suggestion or peer influence) or they may be forcibly abducted by piratical gangs.

== Causes  ==

There are a number of reasons why an adult pirate commander would view children as being of significant tactical value.  These perceptions render children vulnerable to abduction or forced recruitment.  As noted by Carl Conradi:

:"Like warlords, pirate commanders recruit children because they are vulnerable and easily manipulated; fearless and ignorant of the long-term consequences of their actions; inexpensive to maintain; plentiful in developing countries most afflicted by piracy; small in stature and therefore nimble; easily indoctrinated; largely invulnerable to legal proceedings; and because they pose a moral challenge to their enemies."&lt;ref name="navalreview"&gt;http://www.navalreview.ca/2013/02/the-invisible-phenomenon-of-child-piracy/&lt;/ref&gt;”

In other cases, children may volunteer to participate in piratical activities.  However, as asserted by the Canada-based [[Roméo Dallaire]] Child Soldiers Initiative, "'voluntary' enlistment must be understood in terms of the limited choices and circumstances that may exist in the context of a particular country."&lt;ref name="childsoldiers"&gt;http://www.childsoldiers.org/files/publications/2012-DMPP-Children-Youth-Marine-Piracy.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;’  If a child is extremely poor, has been displaced from his or her home, has been separated from his or her family, has limited educational opportunities or has been exposed to conflict, there is an increased likelihood that he or she will view piracy as a legitimate vehicle for social advancement.

== National and international mechanisms and laws ==

In the absence of specific international legislation on juvenile maritime piracy, the precise age of a child’s criminal responsibility when committing piratical acts differs from country to country.  There are, however, a number of international conventions pertaining to either maritime law or children’s rights that may provide some guidance as to the proper handling of child pirates.

=== United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea  ===

While the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS, 1982) does not discuss children’s involvement in maritime criminal activities, it does provide a clear definition of piracy.  According to Article 101, piracy is:

:a) any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft, and directed:
:::i. on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft;
:::ii. against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any State;
:b) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft;
:c) any act of inciting or intentionally facilitating an act described in subparagraph (a) or (b).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part7.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

UNCLOS does recognise universal jurisdiction over the crime of piracy but it only applies to criminal acts that take place on international waters.  If an act of piracy occurs within a country’s territorial waters, it is a matter of state jurisdiction and prosecution.

=== International Labour Organisation Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention ===

Article 3 of the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention]] (No. 182, 1999) stipulates that:

:…the term the worst forms of child labour comprises:

:a) all forms of [[slavery]] or practices similar to slavery, such as the sale and [[trafficking of children]], [[debt bondage]] and [[serfdom]] and forced or [[Unfree labour|compulsory labour]], including forced or compulsory [[Military use of children|recruitment of children for use in armed conflict]];
:b) the use, procuring or offering of a child for [[Prostitution of children|prostitution]], for the production of pornography or for pornographic performances;
:c) the use, procuring or offering of a child for illicit activities, in particular for the production and trafficking of drugs defined in the relevant international treaties;
:d) work which, by its nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely to harm the health, safety or morals of children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C182&lt;/ref&gt;

Insofar as participation in any form of maritime criminality is dangerous (and indeed, potentially lethal), child piracy clearly constitutes a worst form of child labour.

According to the Convention, a child is any person who is below the age of 18.

As of April 2013, eight countries had not signed ILO Convention No. 182.  These include Cuba, Eritrea, India, the Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Palau, Somalia and Tuvalu.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11310:0::NO:11310:P11310_INSTRUMENT_ID:312327:NO&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of these countries – India and Somalia – are currently detaining and prosecuting alleged child pirates.

=== United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child ===

Like ILO Convention No. 182, Article 1 of the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unicef-irc.org/portfolios/crc.html&lt;/ref&gt; (1990) specifies that a child is any human being below the age of 18 years.  However, the same article adds a caveat to the effect that a country’s minimum age of criminal responsibility may be lower than 18, as stipulated by national law.

Other sections that may have some bearing upon the status of child pirates include Article 6, in which, “States Parties recognize that every child has the inherent right to life,” and that, “States Parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child.”

Article 19(1) affirms that, “States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.”  This clause may be particularly relevant in cases where a child’s parents have forced him or her to participate in piratical activity, or where the State is responsible for detaining, interrogating, trying and/or incarcerating a captured child pirate.

Article 32(1) echoes ILO Convention No. 182 by stipulating that, “States Parties recognize the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education, or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.”

Article 35 says that, “State Parties shall take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction of, the sale of or traffic in children for any purpose or in any form.”  When a piratical gang permanently separates a child from his or her family, this may constitute an act of child trafficking.

Article 37(a) affirms that, “No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age.”  Likewise, Article 37(c) states that, “Every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her age.  In particular, every child deprived of liberty shall be separated from adults unless it is considered in the child’s best interests not to do so and shall have the right to maintain contact with his or her family through correspondence and visits, save in exceptional circumstances.”

Lastly, Article 39 stipulates that, “State Parties shall take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of: any form of neglect, exploitation or abuse; torture or any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; or armed conflicts.  Such recovery and reintegration shall take place in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child.”

=== Other regional mechanisms and conventions ===

The third version of the ''Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy off the Coast of Somalia and in the Arabian Sea Area&lt;ref&gt;http://www.secure-marine.com/bmp3/bpm3_pdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;'' (June 2010) recommends a sample follow-up report that should be filled by the captain of any vessel that has come under pirate attack.  While the report does solicit certain details concerning the offending raiding party – such as the number of constituent pirate members, their physical appearance and the weapons that were used – it does not ask for the estimated ages of pirates.

The [[Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia]] (ReCAAP) is a multilateral pact that facilitates information sharing between signatory countries.  The reporting mechanism that it establishes does not specifically call for the collection of disaggregated data pertaining to the ages of captured pirates.

According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the UN [[Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia]] is in the midst of drafting an apprehension and transfer protocol for juvenile pirates who are captured by international navies operating in the Horn of Africa region.

=== National laws and judicial mechanisms ===

All three of the main Somali sub-regions (i.e., [[Somalia|South-Central]], [[Puntland]] and [[Somaliland]]) have signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with the governments of Mauritius and the Seychelles, allowing for the transfer of convicted pirates to prison facilities in Somalia.  These MoUs, however, do not specify clear standard operating procedures for processing and/or transferring pirates who are determined to be under the age of 18.  Kenya is also trying suspected Somali pirates but no prisoner transfer agreement is currently in place.

According to UNICEF-Somalia, some 100 child pirates are currently being detained in a prison in [[Bosaso]], Puntland.  A second prison for juvenile pirates with a capacity of 100 is being built in [[Garoowe]], while a 70-person prison for juvenile pirates is being built in Somaliland.

The Republic of Somaliland’s Juvenile Justice Law (2007) raised the age of criminal responsibility for 14 to 15 years and established separate judicial mechanisms for minors, such as child-specific courts of first instance and appellate courts.  However, Somaliland’s Law on Combating Piracy (2012) does not make any specific reference to persons under the age of 18.

The Somali sub-region of Puntland does not have any specific legislation pertaining to child protection, though as of April 2013, a policy on orphans and other vulnerable children had been tabled in Parliament.

India’s Piracy Bill (2012) does not make any specific reference to persons under the age of 18.

== Incidences ==

=== Nigeria ===

According to the Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative:

:"In Nigeria, young unemployed men, in particular, are frequently enticed into the organized pirate gangs operating in the Delta region by “…promised riches, fancy cars, luxury goods and weapons,” such that these gangs are increasingly composed of younger members.  It has also become recognized that in Nigeria, social mobility and the struggle for survival now necessitate the use of violence as “…society gradually stopped recognizing merit and force became a plausible avenue to the top of social and economic strata with drug trafficking, smuggling and other perceived moneymaking ventures like armed robbery, seen as ways to get rich quickly."&lt;ref name="childsoldiers" /&gt;”’

=== Somalia ===

One of the most egregious instances of child maritime piracy off the coast of Somalia is recounted on the Canadian Naval Review’s Broadsides forum:

:"In March 2011, Indian naval forces operating in the Arabian Sea captured the Mozambique-flagged fishing vessel ''Vega 5''.  Somali pirates had kidnapped the trawler’s original crew several months earlier.  They subsequently refurbished the stolen craft into an operationally significant "mothership".  Of the 61 marauders who were arrested during the Indian raid, an astonishing 25 persons – or some 40% of the entire crew – were determined to be under the age of 15.  Indeed, ensuring reports revealed that four of the pirates could not have been older than 11."&lt;ref name="navalreview" /&gt;'

The ''Vega 5'' hijacking does not appear to be an isolated incident.  The Broadsides article continues to report that:

:"During a recent visit to the autonomous Somali region of Puntland, former UN Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, Ms. [[Radhika Coomaraswamy]], was told by a jailed adult pirate that his colleagues and superiors were increasingly reliant upon child recruits when attempting seize ships for ransom.  Many of the adults who are responsible for directing piracy operations only do so from their homes on land, rather than from motherships on the high seas.  As such, according to Ms. Coomaraswamy, the individuals actually sent out to, "…do the dangerous stuff are the young children, between the ages of 15, 16 and 17."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabnews.com/node/360064&lt;/ref&gt;"'

The Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative has determined that a significant proportion of those Somali pirates who are currently being tried internationally are actually under the age of 18.  In India, 38 out of 61 pirates (62%) facing trial are juveniles; in Germany, 3 out of 10 (30%) are children; and in the United States of America, all three Somali pirates currently facing trial are under the age of 18.&lt;ref name="childsoldiers" /&gt;

=== Sri Lanka ===

The Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative has noted that:&lt;ref name="childsoldiers" /&gt;

:"As part of its military strategy, the [[LTTE]] [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] maintained “…the most comprehensive naval networks among the [US-designated] foreign terrorist organizations&lt;ref name="asiantribune"&gt;http://www.asiantribune.com/?q=node/16950&lt;/ref&gt;…”.  This branch of operations, called the [[Sea Tigers]], launched a multitude of attacks upon international cargo ships, including several – such as the Greek-registered freighter ''Stillus Limassul'' – that were carrying weapons to be used by the Sri Lankan military.&lt;ref name="asiantribune" /&gt;  Like its army, the LTTE’s naval branch actively recruited and deployed child soldiers.  Indeed, there is evidence that during periods of LTTE-sponsored disarmament of child soldiers, underage members of the Sea Tigers were surreptitiously retained, as they had frequently received resource-intensive training that made them particularly strong military assets."&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, C. L. (2006). ''Child Recruitment in South Asian Conflicts''. Chatham House (The Royal Institute of International Affairs): UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also very common for “…very young Tamils (some as young as 13) [to be] pressed into service to fill the [naval] ranks as the long-running insurgency depleted LTTE manpower.&lt;ref&gt;Povlock, P. A. (2011, September 9). 'A Guerilla War at Sea: The Sri Lankan Civil War'. ''Small Wars Journal''. Retrieved from http://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/a-guerilla-war- at-sea-the-sri-lankan-civil-war.&lt;/ref&gt;”'

:''This article is concerned with cultural resources in the widest sense: for traditional, archaeological and historic culture specifically, also see [[cultural heritage management]]''

In the broadest sense, '''cultural resources management''' ('''CRM''') is the vocation and practice of managing cultural resources, such as [[the arts]] and [[cultural heritage|heritage]]. It incorporates Cultural Heritage Management which is concerned with traditional and historic culture. It also delves into the material culture of [[archaeology]].  Cultural resources management encompasses current culture, including progressive and innovative culture, such as [[urban culture]], rather than simply preserving and presenting traditional forms of culture.

However, the broad usage of the term is relatively recent and as a result it is most often used as synonymous with [[heritage management]]. In the United States, cultural resources management is not usually divorced from the heritage context. The term is, "used mostly by archaeologists and much more occasionally by architectural historians and historical architects, to refer to managing historic places of archaeological, architectural, and historical interests and considering such places in compliance with environmental and historic preservation laws." &lt;ref&gt;King 1998, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural resources include both physical assets such as [[archaeology]], [[architecture]], [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]]s and also [[intangible culture]] such as [[folklore]] and interpretative arts, such as [[storytelling]] and [[drama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gov.uk/Reference_library/Research/det/glossary_abbreviations.htm UK definition of cultural sector]&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural resource managers are typically in charge of [[museum]]s, [[art museum|galleries]], [[theatre]]s etc., especially those that emphasize culture specific to the local region or ethnic group.  [[Cultural tourism]] is a significant sector of the tourism industry.

At a national and international level, cultural resource management may be concerned with larger themes, such as [[language]]s in danger of extinction, [[public education]], the ethos or operation of [[multiculturalism]], and promoting access to cultural resources.  The [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] is an attempt by the [[United Nations]] to identify exemplars of intangible culture.

==Background==
Cultural resource management can trace its beginning to the environment/conservational movement in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, there was growth in legislation concerning the protection of cultural resources. The Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974, commonly known as the Moss-Bennett Act, helped to fuel the creation of CRM, while creating “growth in archaeological jobs in the federal government, academia, and private sector.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Federal legislation had passed earlier in 1906 under the [[Antiquities Act]], but it was not until the 1970s when the term “cultural resources” was coined by the National Park Service. This term came into more popular usage after two meetings in 1974: the Cultural Resource Management conference and the Airlie House conference.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Following these conferences, the National Park Service (NPS) defined cultural resources in the Cultural Resource Management Guidelines as being:

“Those tangible and intangible aspects of cultural systems, both living and dead, that are valued by or representative of a given culture or that contain information about a culture…[They] include but are not limited to sites, structures, districts, objects, and historic documents associated with or representative of peoples, cultures, and human activities and events, either in the present or in the past. Cultural resources also can include primary written and verbal data for interpretation and understanding of those tangible resources.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural resources management applied to heritage management==
{{main article|Cultural heritage management}}
'''Cultural resources management''' in the heritage context is mainly concerned with the investigation of sites with archaeological potential, the preservation and interpretation of historic sites and artifacts, and the culture of indigenous people.  The subject developed from initiatives in [[rescue archaeology]], sensitivities to the treatment of indigenous people, and subsequent legislation to protect cultural heritage.

In the 1970s, archaeologists created the term "cultural resource management" as a parallel to natural resource management to address the following resources:&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, pp. 5, 6&lt;/ref&gt;
* Historic properties (as listed or eligible for the [[National Register of Historic Places]])
* Older properties that may have cultural value, but may or may not be eligible for the National Register
* Historic properties that have cultural value beyond their historicity
* Archeological graves and cultural items
* Shipwrecks
* Museum collections
* Historical documents
* Religious sites
* Religious practices
* Cultural use of natural resources
* Folklife, tradition, and other social institutions
* Theater groups, orchestras, and other community cultural amenities

A significant proportion of the archaeological investigation in countries that have heritage management legislation including the United States and United Kingdom is conducted on sites under threat of development. In the US, such investigations are now done by private companies on a consulting basis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unm.edu/~dap/daddy/daddy.html "Who's my Daddy? Who's my Mommy?] Results of a Poll on the Origins of Private-Sector CRM," by David A. Phillips, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt; and a national organization exists to support the practice of CRM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acra-crm.org Web site of the American Cultural Resources Association]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Museum]]s, besides being popular tourist attractions, often play roles in conservation of, and research on, threatened sites, including as repositories for collections from sites slated for destruction.

==National Register eligibility==
In the United States, a common Cultural Resource Management task is the implementation of a Section 106 review: CRM archaeologists determine whether federally funded projects are likely to damage or destroy archaeological sites that may be eligible for the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  This process commonly entails one or more [[archaeological field survey]]s.

==Careers in CRM==
Cultural resource management features people from a wide array of disciplines. The general education of most involved in CRM includes, but is not limited to, sociology, archaeology, architectural history, cultural anthropology, social and cultural geography, and other fields in the social sciences.

In the field of cultural resource management there are many career choices. One could obtain a career with an action agency that works directly with the NEPA or even more specifically, Native American resources.&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; There are also careers that can be found in review agencies like the [[Advisory Council on Historic Preservation]] (ACHP), or the [[state historic preservation office]] (SHPO) Beyond these choices, one could also obtain a career as part of the local government and work with planning agencies, housing agencies, social service agencies, local museums, libraries, or educational institutions. Jobs at private cultural resource management companies can range from field technicians (see [[shovelbum]]) to principal investigators, project archaeologists, historic preservationists, and laboratory work.  One could also become a part of an advocacy organization, such as the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref&gt;King 1998, pp. 241, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==
It is commonly debated in cultural resource management how to determine whether cultural or archaeological sites should be considered significant or not. The criteria that is stated by the National Register of Historic Places is said to be able to be “interpreted in different ways so that the significance… may be subjectively argued for many cultural resources.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue that arises among scholars is that “protection does not necessarily mean preservation.” &lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Any public projects occurring near the cultural resource can have adverse effects. Development plans for a proposed project may not be able to be changed to limit impact and to avoid damage to the resource.&lt;ref&gt;Kerber 1994, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management of cultural organizations==
The vocation of management in cultural and creative sectors is the subject of research and improvement initiatives, by organizations such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20100416204313/http://www.aandb.org.uk/ Arts and Business] which take a partnership approach to involving professional business people in running and mentoring arts organizations.  Some universities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dkit.ie/display.asp?id=161 BA in Cultural Resources Management at Dundalk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207233207/http://www.dkit.ie/display.asp?id=161 |date=2007-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmu.ac.uk/faculties/humanities/pg/ma/ecp_course_overview.jsp MA in European Cultural Planning at De Montfort]&lt;/ref&gt; now offer vocational degrees.

The management of cultural heritage is underpinned by academic research in [[archaeology]], [[ethnography]] and [[history]].  The broader subject is also underpinned by research in [[sociology]] and [[culture studies]].

==Anthropology==
{{main article|Cultural anthropology}}
Understanding the traditional cultures of all peoples (Indigenous or not) is essential in mitigating the adverse impact of development and ensuring that intervention by more developed nations is not prejudicial to the interests of local people or results in the extinction of cultural resources.

==Cultural resources policies==
Cultural resources policies have developed over time with the recognition of the economic and social importance of heritage and other cultural assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturalpolicies.net/ Compendium of Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

The exploitation of cultural resources can be controversial, particularly where the finite cultural heritage resources of developing countries are exported to satisfy the demand for antiquities market in the developed world.  The exploitation of the potential intellectual property of traditional remedies in identifying candidates for new drugs has also been controversial.  On the other hand, traditional crafts can be important elements of income from tourism, performance of traditional dances, and music that is popular with tourists and traditional designs can be exploited in the fashion industry.  Popular culture can also be an important economic asset.

A '''drainage basin''' is any area of land where [[precipitation]] collects and drains off into a common outlet, such as into a [[river]], [[bay]], or other [[body of water]]. The drainage basin includes all the [[surface water]] from [[surface runoff|rain runoff]], [[snowmelt]], and nearby streams that run downslope towards the shared outlet, as well as the [[groundwater]] underneath the earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/glossary/a_d/drainage_basin.html |title=drainage basin |work=The Physical Environment |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040321033433/http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/glossary/a_d/drainage_basin.html|archivedate=March 21, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drainage basins connect into other drainage basins at lower elevations in a [[Strahler number|hierarchical pattern]], with smaller '''sub-drainage basins''', which in turn drain into another common outlet.&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;{{cite web |author= |year= |url=http://www.wr.udel.edu/cb/whatwhycare.html |title=What is a watershed and why should I care? |publisher=university of delaware |accessdate=2008-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms used interchangeably with ''drainage basin'' are '''catchment area''', '''catchment basin''', '''drainage area''', '''river basin''', and '''water basin'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=David|authorlink=|title=The Field Guide to Geology|publisher=Checkmark Books|series=|year=1998| pages=130–13|doi=|isbn=0-8160-3823-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North America]], the term '''''watershed''''' is commonly used to mean a drainage basin, though in other English-speaking countries, it is used only in its original sense, that of a [[drainage divide]].

In a closed drainage basin, or [[endorheic basin]], the water converges to a single point inside the basin, known as a [[sink (geography)|sink]], which may be a permanent lake, a [[dry lake]], or a point where surface water is [[Losing stream|lost underground]].&lt;ref name=virginia&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/stormwater_management/hu.shtml |title= Hydrologic Unit Geography |publisher= Virginia Department of Conservation &amp; Recreation |accessdate= 21 November 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20121214100316/http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/stormwater_management/hu.shtml |archivedate= 14 December 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The drainage basin acts as a [[funnel]] by collecting all the water within the area covered by the basin and channelling it to a single point. Each drainage basin is separated topographically from adjacent basins by a perimeter, the [[drainage divide]], making up a succession of higher geographical features (such as a [[ridge]], [[hill]] or [[mountain]]s) forming a barrier.

Drainage basins are similar but not identical to [[Hydrological code|hydrologic units]], which are drainage areas delineated so as to nest into a multi-level hierarchical [[drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage system]]. Hydrologic units are defined to allow multiple inlets, outlets, or sinks. In a strict sense, all drainage basins are hydrologic units but not all hydrologic units are drainage basins.&lt;ref name=virginia/&gt;

== Major drainage basins of the world ==
{{See also|List of drainage basins by area}}

=== Map ===
[[File:Ocean drainage.png|frameless|center|upright=3.1|Major [[continental divide]]s, showing drainage into the major oceans and seas of the world.]]
&lt;center&gt;Drainage basins of the principal oceans and seas of the world. Grey areas are [[endorheic basin]]s that do not drain to the oceans.&lt;/center&gt;

=== Ocean basins ===
The following is a list of the major ocean basins:
* About 48.7% of the world's land drains to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].{{fact|date=January 2017}} In [[North America]], surface water drains to the Atlantic via the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and [[Great Lakes]] basins, the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] of the United States, the [[Maritimes|Canadian Maritimes]], and most of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. Nearly all of [[South America]] east of the [[Andes]] also drains to the Atlantic, as does most of [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] and the greatest portion of western [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], as well as [[Western Sahara]] and part of [[Morocco]]. The two major [[Mediterranean sea (oceanography)|mediterranean seas]] of the world also flow to the Atlantic:
** The [[Caribbean Sea]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]] basin includes most of the U.S. interior between the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] and [[Rocky Mountains]], a small part of the Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]], eastern [[Central America]], the islands of the Caribbean and the Gulf, and a small part of northern South America.
** The [[Mediterranean Sea]] basin includes much of [[North Africa]], east-central [[Africa]] (through the [[Nile River]]), [[Southern Europe|Southern]], Central, and [[Eastern Europe]], [[Turkey]], and the coastal areas of [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Syria]].
* The [[Arctic Ocean]] drains most of [[Western Canada|Western]] and [[Northern Canada]] east of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], northern [[Alaska]] and parts of [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Montana]] in the United States, the north shore of the [[Scandinavian peninsula]] in Europe, central and northern Russia, and parts of [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]] in [[Asia]], which totals to about 17% of the world's land.&lt;!-- Roughly (+/-0,7% error), computed. --~~~~ --&gt; 
* Just over 13% of the land in the world drains to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Its basin includes much of China, eastern and southeastern Russia, Japan, the [[Korean Peninsula]], most of Indochina, Indonesia and Malaysia, the Philippines, all of the [[Pacific Islands]], the northeast coast of [[Australia]], and Canada and the United States west of the Continental Divide (including most of Alaska), as well as western Central America and South America west of the Andes.
* The [[Indian Ocean]]'s drainage basin also comprises about 13% of Earth's land. It drains the eastern coast of Africa, the coasts of the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], Burma, and most of Australia.
* The [[Southern Ocean]] drains [[Antarctica]]. Antarctica comprises approximately eight percent of the Earth's land.

=== Largest river basins ===
{{See also|List of drainage basins by area}}
The five largest river basins (by area), from largest to smallest, are the basins of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] (7M km{{sup|2}}), the [[Congo River|Congo]] (4M km{{sup|2}}), the [[Nile River|Nile]] (3.4M km{{sup|2}}), the [[Río de la Plata]] (3.2M km{{sup|2}}), and the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] (3M km{{sup|2}}). The three rivers that drain the most water, from most to least, are the Amazon, [[Ganga River|Ganga]], and Congo rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta Encyclopedia articles on [[Amazon River]], [[Congo River]], and [[Ganges]] Published by Microsoft in computers.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endorheic drainage basins ===
[[File:Uureg Nuur.jpg|thumb|[[Endorheic basin]] in [[Central Asia]]]]
{{Main article|Endorheic basin}}
[[Endorheic basin|Endorheic drainage basins]] are inland basins that do not drain to an ocean. Around 18% of all land drains to endorheic lakes or seas or sinks. The largest of these consists of much of the interior of [[Asia]], which drains into the [[Caspian Sea]], the [[Aral Sea]], and numerous smaller lakes. Other endorheic regions include the [[Great Basin]] in the United States, much of the [[Sahara Desert]], the drainage basin of the [[Okavango River]] ([[Kalahari Basin]]), highlands near the [[African Great Lakes]], the interiors of [[Australia]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and parts in [[Mexico]] and the [[Andes]]. Some of these, such as the Great Basin, are not single drainage basins but collections of separate, adjacent closed basins.

In endorheic [[Bodies of water|bodies of standing water]] where evaporation is the primary means of water loss, the water is typically more saline than the oceans. An extreme example of this is the [[Dead Sea]].

== Importance of drainage basins ==

=== Geopolitical boundaries ===
Drainage basins have been historically important for determining territorial boundaries, particularly in regions where trade by water has been important. For example, the [[England|English]] crown gave the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] a monopoly on the [[fur trade]] in the entire [[Hudson Bay]] basin, an area called [[Rupert's Land]]. [[bioregionalism|Bioregional]] political organization today includes agreements of states (e.g., international [[treaty|treaties]] and, within the U.S.A., [[interstate compact]]s) or other political entities in a particular drainage basin to manage the body or bodies of water into which it drains. Examples of such interstate compacts are the [[Great Lakes Commission]] and the [[Tahoe Regional Planning Agency]].

=== Hydrology ===
[[File:Ohiorivermap.png|thumb|right|Drainage basin of the [[Ohio River]], part of the [[Mississippi River]] drainage basin]]

In [[hydrology]], the drainage basin is a logical unit of focus for studying the movement of water within the [[hydrological cycle]], because the majority of water that discharges from the basin outlet originated as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falling on the basin. A portion of the water that enters the [[groundwater]] system beneath the drainage basin may flow towards the outlet of another drainage basin because groundwater flow directions do not always match those of their overlying drainage network. Measurement of the discharge of water from a basin may be made by a [[stream gauge]] located at the basin's outlet.

Rain gauge data is used to measure total precipitation over a drainage basin, and there are different ways to interpret that data. If the gauges are many and evenly distributed over an area of uniform precipitation, using the [[arithmetic mean]] method will give good results. In the [[Thiessen polygon]] method, the drainage basin is divided into polygons with the rain gauge in the middle of each polygon assumed to be representative for the rainfall on the area of land included in its polygon. These polygons are made by drawing lines between gauges, then making perpendicular bisectors of those lines form the polygons. The [[isohyet]]al method involves contours of equal precipitation are drawn over the gauges on a map. Calculating the area between these curves and adding up the volume of water is time consuming.

[[Isochrone map]]s can be used to show the time taken for runoff water within a drainage basin to reach a lake, reservoir or outlet, assuming constant and uniform effective rainfall.&lt;ref name="hydrolearthsystsci bell 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/2/265/1998/hess-2-265-1998.pdf | title=A grid-based distributed flood forecasting model for use with weather radar data: Part 1.

=== Geomorphology ===
Drainage basins are the principal hydrologic unit considered in [[fluvial]] [[geomorphology]]. A drainage basin is the source for water and [[sediment]] that moves from higher elevation through the river system to lower elevations as they reshape the channel forms.

[[File:Mississippi River basin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Mississippi River]] drains the largest area of any [[United States|U.S.]] river, much of it [[agriculture|agricultural]] regions. Agricultural runoff and other water pollution that flows to the outlet is the cause of the [[dead zone (ecology)|hypoxic, or dead zone]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].]]

Drainage basins are important in [[ecology]]. As water flows over the ground and along rivers it can pick up nutrients, sediment, and [[water pollution|pollutants]]. With the water, they are transported towards the outlet of the basin, and can affect the ecological processes along the way as well as in the receiving water source.

Modern use of artificial fertilizers, containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, has affected the mouths of drainage basins. The minerals are carried by the drainage basin to the mouth, and may accumulate there, disturbing the natural mineral balance. This can cause [[eutrophication]] where plant growth is accelerated by the additional material.

=== Resource management ===
{{further information|Watershed management}}
Because drainage basins are coherent entities in a hydro-logical sense, it has become common to manage water resources on the basis of individual basins. In the [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]], governmental entities that perform this function are called "[[Watershed district (Minnesota)|watershed district]]s". In New Zealand, they are called catchment boards. Comparable community groups based in Ontario, Canada, are called [[Conservation authority (Canada)|conservation authorities]]. In North America, this function is referred to as "[[watershed management]]".
In [[Brazil]], the National Policy of Water Resources, regulated by Act n° 9.433 of 1997, establishes the drainage basin as the territorial division of Brazilian water management.

When a river basin crosses at least one political border, either a border within a nation or an international boundary, it is identified as a [[transboundary river]]. Management of such basins becomes the responsibility of the countries sharing it. [[Nile Basin Initiative]], [[OMVS]] for [[Senegal River]], [[Mekong River Commission]] are a few examples of arrangements involving management of shared river basins.

Management of shared drainage basins is also seen as a way to build lasting peaceful relationships among countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/inner-articles.php?id=310#.WA9Ia-V97GI|title=Articles|website=www.strategicforesight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catchment factors ==
The catchment is the most significant factor determining the amount or likelihood of [[flooding]].

Catchment factors are: [[topography]], shape, size, [[soil]] type, and [[land use]] (paved or [[roof]]ed areas). Catchment topography and shape determine the time taken for [[rain]] to reach the river, while catchment size, soil type, and development determine the amount of water to reach the river.

=== Topography ===
Generally, topography plays a big part in how fast runoff will reach a river. Rain that falls in steep [[mountain]]ous areas will reach the primary river in the drainage basin faster than flat or lightly sloping areas (e.g., &gt; 1% gradient).

=== Shape ===
Shape will contribute to the speed with which the runoff reaches a river. A long thin catchment will take longer to drain than a circular catchment.

=== Size ===
Size will help determine the amount of water reaching the river, as the larger the catchment the greater the potential for flooding. It is also determined on the basis of length and width of the drainage basin.

=== Soil type ===
Soil type will help determine how much water reaches the river. Certain soil types such as [[sand]]y soils are very free-draining, and rainfall on sandy soil is likely to be absorbed by the ground. However, soils containing [[clay]] can be almost impermeable and therefore rainfall on clay soils will run off and contribute to flood volumes. After prolonged rainfall even free-draining soils can become [[wikt:saturated|saturated]], meaning that any further rainfall will reach the river rather than being absorbed by the ground. If the surface is impermeable the precipitation will create surface run-off which will lead to higher risk of flooding; if the ground is permeable, the precipitation will infiltrate the soil.

=== Land use ===
Land use can contribute to the volume of water reaching the river, in a similar way to clay soils. For example, rainfall on roofs, [[sidewalk|pavements]], and [[road]]s will be collected by rivers with almost no absorption into the [[groundwater]].

'''Fourierism''' is the systematic set of economic, political, and social beliefs first espoused by French intellectual [[Charles Fourier]] (1772–1837). Based upon a belief in the inevitability of communal associations of people who worked and lived together as part of the human future, Fourier's committed supporters referred to his doctrines as '''Associationism'''. Political contemporaries and subsequent scholarship has identified Fourier's set of ideas as a form of [[utopian socialism]]{{Spaced en dash}}a phrase which retains mild pejorative overtones.

Never tested in practice at any scale in Fourier's lifetime, Fourierism enjoyed a brief boom in the [[United States of America]] during the middle of the 1840s{{Spaced en dash}}owing largely to the efforts of his American popularizer, [[Albert Brisbane]] (1809–1890) and the [[American Union of Associationists]]{{Spaced en dash}}but ultimately failed as a social and economic model. The system was briefly revived in the middle 1850s by [[Victor Prosper Considerant|Victor Considerant]] (1808–1893), a French disciple of Fourier's who [[La Reunion (Dallas)|unsuccessfully attempted to relaunch]] the model in the American state of [[Texas]] in the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Beecher, ''Victor Considerant''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Doctrine==
===Passional attraction===

In contrast to the thoroughly [[secular]] communitarianism of his contemporary [[Robert Owen]] (1771–1858), [[Charles Fourier|Charles Fourier's]] thinking starts from a presumption of the existence of God and a divine social order on Earth in accordance with the will of God.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Franklin (ed.), "Introduction" to [https://archive.org/details/selectionsfromw00fourgoog ''Selections from the Works of Fourier.''] London: Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co., 1901; pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourier saw himself as a figure of world-historical importance akin to [[Isaac Newton]] (1643–1727) for having identified the fundamental force driving social development, which he called "passional attraction" ''(attraction passionelle).''&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier believed that the structure of the world{{Spaced en dash}}that is the economic, political, and social system{{Spaced en dash}}inhibited humanity from the pursuit of their God-given individual passions, thereby preventing mankind from achieving a state of universal harmony.&lt;ref name=Franklin18&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than seeking to mold individuals to fit the existing form of economic, political, and social life, as had been the traditional goal of the educational and what we today call the [[socialization]] process, Fourier believed that instead the form of economic, political, and social life should itself be altered to fit the inherent passions of the individual, since these economic and social structures were man-made and not God-given.&lt;ref name=Franklin18 /&gt;

Through conscious understanding of this process, which Fourier characterized as "social science," new economic and social formations called "Associations" could be created, structured in such a way as to allow individuals to follow their passions and in this way advance towards the state of universal harmony.&lt;ref name=Franklin18 /&gt;

Always one to list and to systematize, Fourier declared there existed twelve basic passions of humanity grouped around three branches of a "passional tree": "luxurious passions" of the senses; "affective passions" of love, friendship, and parenthood; and the oft-ignored "distributive passions" such as the need for political intrigue, the need for variety, and the pure enthusiasm of spiritual pursuits.&lt;ref name=Guarneri18&gt;Carl J. Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative: Fourierism in Nineteenth-Century America.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1991; pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The sum of all these passions Fourier called "unityism," characterized as a universal feeling of benevolence and fraternity.&lt;ref name=Guarneri18 /&gt; Although fettered and mutated by Civilization, the free development of these passions would be allowed in the bright future world, Fourier believed.&lt;ref name=Guarneri18 /&gt;

===Stages of society===

Fourier believed himself the discoverer of the universal laws of societal evolution, theorizing the existence of 32 distinct periods beginning with Edenism and continuing through Savagery, Patriarchate, and Barbarism, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these stages was held to have distinctive material and ideological features, with the treatment afforded to women a particular marker of one stage from the next.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Of far greater concern to Fourier and his disciples was the current 5th form of society, Modern Society, as well as three emerging forms which were believed to be just around the corner: 6 (Guarantism), 7 (Simple Association), and 8 (Compound Association).&lt;ref name=Sears1-2&gt;Charles Sears, [https://archive.org/details/TheNorthAmericanPhalanx ''The North American Phalanx: An Historical and Descriptive Sketch.''] Prescott, WI: John M. Pryse, Publisher, 1886; pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Modern Society," from the Fourierist perspective, was based upon capital and labor and the buying and selling of goods through a network of useless middlemen.&lt;ref name=Sears1&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; With a sneer, Fourier referred to contemporary society as "Civilization," deeming it the cause of fraud, waste, and human unhappiness.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The "isolated family" he deemed inefficient, the wage system demoralizing and exploitative, and organized religion corrupt.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17 /&gt; An entire book was written detailing 36 types of bankruptcy and 76 sorts of "cuckoldry" to which humanity was subjected by its system of so-called Civilization, which Fourier viewed not only as imperfect but as wholly unacceptable.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17 /&gt;

Fourier believed that fortunately for humanity, the Civilization of modern society was a fleeting economic formation, soon to vanish from the Earth.&lt;ref name=Guarneri17 /&gt; The emerging socio-economic structure of "Guarantism" would be based upon the fundamental principle of universal insurance, Fourier believed, which was to include guarantee of the security of capital and guarantee on the right of labor to gainful employment.&lt;ref name=Sears1-2 /&gt; Petty traders and speculative profiteers would be eliminated from the economy in this new system of organized production and distribution, it was believed.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt;

The next stage in the Fourierist schema, that of "Simple Association," was to be based upon the cooperative enterprise of like bodies of farmers or artisans or industrial workers as distinct groups.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt; Farmers would associate with other farmers, artisans with other artisans, industrial producers with other industrial producers, producing and selling their goods collectively.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt; Simultaneously, these economic organizations were to for the first time include the association of family living and domestic labor,&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt; thereby eliminating the economic waste and social isolation of individual living. [[Wage labour|Wage labor]] would be eliminated, as the members of each of these associations would be co-proprietors, producing in tandem and sharing alike in the proceeds of their efforts.&lt;ref name=Sears1 /&gt;

Subsequently, the Fourierists believed, there would emerge "Compound Association" or "Harmonism." Under Compound Association all pursuits – industrial producers and artisans and farmers alike – would join in large associations which would shatter all economic lines.&lt;ref name=Sears2&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; One Fourierian enthusiast described the system of Compound Association in the following terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every interest is provided for, by an organization which embraces all details of production and distribution; and a system of natural and integral education is instituted – that is, a complete system of physical, mental, and emotional development, intimately connected with daily pursuits, provided for; that art and the science which underlies art may be taught together; that theory and practice may go hand in hand and that the individual may have the command of his whole personal power and enjoy the conditions of expressing it.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Every individual in these Compound Associations would be free to take part in the labor of a dozen or more different work groups, according to their interests and pleasure, over the course of any year, in the Fourierist vision.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; That which the [[Marxism|Marxists]] called [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation of labor]] would thereby be eliminated and production boosted, since "a man having himself on his own side works with more force, greater skill, and better effect than one who works against his inclinations," in the words of one Fourierian.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt;

===Economics===

Fourier believed that economic output was the product of three factors: labor, capital, and talent.&lt;ref name=Franklin20&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these, he argued, were important to production and each needed to be compensated as such for the general prosperity of the organized association to be preserved.&lt;ref name=Franklin20 /&gt; The communal associations which emerged based upon Fourier's ideas were generally formed as [[joint stock companies]], and their investor-members were compensated separately on the basis both of amount of capital invested and amount of labor performed – with labor time given a range of values based both on the necessity and difficulty of the work and the degree of talent and skill with which it was performed.

===Social life===
[[File:Phalanstère.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Elevated view of a Fourierist ''Phalanstère'' from the works of Victor Considerant.]]

Fourier's prescription was the establishment of communities called Phalanxes or Associations in the countryside. Housed inside gigantic serpentine edifices called "phalanstries" would be 1620 people, coming from various occupations and social classes.&lt;ref&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; These residents were to be arranged in occupational "series," according to Fourier's model – major divisions such as between agrarians and industrial producers and artisans – which would be further divided into smaller "groups" to cooperatively conduct specific aspects of the work.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Mobility of the individual between various groups and even sections according to personal desires was to be allowed.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt;

Fundamental to the Fourierian ideal was the notion of collective living and the rational performance of domestic duties. Individual households were seen as both wasteful in terms of duplicated effort performed and isolating of individuals – standing in the way of true cooperation and social harmony.

Remaining in unpublished manuscript form until 1967 would be Fourier's imaginative predictions about degrees of sexual promiscuity and the institutions and moral codes which would emerge to govern love and interpersonal relationships in the harmonious world of Compound Association.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt;

===Role of force===

The Fourierian system of associations was based on the notion of voluntary participation and expansion through the force of example. Once founded, associations would demonstrate their practical merits and inspire emulation, with the first model communities replicating and spreading from localities to regions to nations and internationally. Never in his writings does Fourier appeal for the use of governmental legislation or coercive power of any sort, instead believing association to be a natural and wholly voluntary structure,&lt;ref name=Franklin21&gt;Franklin, "Introduction" to ''Selections from the Works of Fourier,'' pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; part of a Divine Social Code.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt;

Moreover, the achievement on an international scale would eliminate war from the face of the earth.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; Instead, industrial armies would be formed to engage in gigantic reclamation projects, irrigating deserts and restoring vegetation and draining marshes and putting the land to cultivation.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; The elimination of disease would follow, as such banes as [[cholera]], [[typhus]], and [[yellow fever]] would vanish with the unhealthful places from whence they originated before society's restorative efforts.&lt;ref name=Sears2 /&gt; Through the planting of vast swaths of timber, cropland would be protected and the earth's climate itself would be slowly transformed, Fourier and his followers believed.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, ''The North American Phalanx,'' pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fantastic theories===

Fourier's theoretical system, described by one scholar as "vast and eccentric,"&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt; was only a part of the output of what another called "a most riotous and unpruned imagination."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Gray to the Aberdeen Philosophical Society, March 15, 1923. Quoted in "The Chaos and Sense of Fourier," ''Aberdeen Journal,'' March 16, 1923, pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Fourier believed that in the new world people would live for 144 years, that new species of friendly and pacifistic animals such as "anti-lions" would emerge, and that over time human beings would develop long and useful tails.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt; Fourier also professed a belief in the ability of [[Metempsychosis|human souls to migrate]] between physical and "aromal" worlds.&lt;ref name=Guarneri19 /&gt; Such thinking was set aside during the last 15 years of Fourier's life, when he instead began to concentrate on testing in practice his economic and social ideas.&lt;ref name=Guarneri20&gt;Guarneri, ''The Utopian Alternative,'' pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier's disciples, including in the first rank the American Albert Brisbane and the French Victor Considerant, later pared down Fourier's writings into a comprehensible system for economic and social organization, with the Fourierist movement experiencing a brief [[boom and bust|boom]] in the United States during the middle years of the 1840s, when some 30 Fourierist associations were established.&lt;ref&gt;William Alfred Hinds, ''American Communities.'' Second edition. Chicago, IL: Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co., 1908; pg. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence on new religious movements ===
The Fourierist doctrine of attractions, correspondences, and analogies was identified with esoteric doctrines like [[Martinism]] by Fourierist like Just Muiron from an early point on.&lt;ref&gt;Strube, ''Sozialismus'', pp. 122-127; Beecher, ''Charles Fourier'', pp. 160-167.&lt;/ref&gt; It is no wonder, then, that contemporary observers like Louis Reybaud, the author of the first study of the socialists, perceived Fourierism and other [[Utopian socialism|early socialist schools]] in the context of mysticism, magic, kabbalah, or the occult sciences.&lt;ref&gt;''Strube, Sozialismus, pp. 105-115.''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it has been shown that Fourierism exerted a decisive influence on new religious movements like [[Spiritualism]] or [[Occultism]] after 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Strube, "Socialist Religion"; cf. Strube, ''Sozialismus'' and Monroe, ''Laboratories''.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this date, Fourierism had already coined the ideas of US-American spiritualist thinkers such as [[Andrew Jackson Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;Albanese, ''Republic'', pp. 171-176, 208-218.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi]], who is regarded as the founder of modern occultism, was a pronounced adherent of Fourierism in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;''Strube, Sozialismus, pp. 316-351.''&lt;/ref&gt; Until the early twentieth century, there was a strong Fourierist presence in French socialist-spiritualist circles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3588">The '''Friedrich Loeffler Institute''' (FLI), is the National Institute for [[Animal Health]] of [[Germany]]. The institute was founded in 1910 and named for its founder [[Friedrich Loeffler]] in 1952. The FLI is situated on the Isle of [[Riems]], which belongs to the City of [[Greifswald]]. Riems is a very small island that can be reached via a dam, which can be closed off in case of an outbreak. Due to these circumstances, Riems posed the perfect location for one of the most modern animal health research facilities in the world.

The Friedrich Loeffler Institute is directly subordinated to the German [[Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (Germany)|Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection]]. Its main subject is the thorough study of livestock health and other closely related subjects including molecular biology, virus diagnostics, immunology, and epidemiology. Federal laws of Germany hold the FLI responsible for national and international animal disease control; it also poses the international reference lab for several viral diseases. The institute publishes its research, and cooperates with other national and international institutions and researchers.

Among the animal diseases under research are for instance [[foot and mouth disease]], [[mad cow disease]], and [[avian influenza]].

Currently, 330 people work for the FLI, and an additional 140 will be employed upon completion of the construction work. Until 2010, the 100th anniversary of the Institute, the FLI is expected to be the most up-to-date animal health research center in Europe. 260 Million [[Euro]]s are spent by the Federal Government to build new laboratories and barns.

As part of this extension, in 2010 the Riems Institute completed [[Biosafety level#Biosafety level 4|Biosafety level 4]] laboratory facilities, which enable research activities on the most dangerous of viruses -- one of four such facilities in Germany.

==Organisation==
The FLI's president is Thomas C. Mettenleiter, who also teaches at the nearby [[University of Greifswald]]. The FLI consists of the following eleven institutions at seven different locations, some of which are to be relocated to Riems by 2010:

* [[Riems]]:
** Institute of Infectology (IMED)
** Institute of Molecular Virology and Cell Biology (IMVZ)
** Institute of Diagnostic Virology (IVD)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25368">'''{{Lang|de|Gutmensch}}''' (literally ''good human'' in German) is an [[ironic]], [[sarcastic]] or disparaging cultural term similar to "do-gooder". Those who use the term are implying that ''Gutmenschen'' have an overwhelming wish to be good and eagerly seek approval. Further suggesting a supposed [[morality|moralising]] and proselytising behaviour and being [[dogmatic]]. In political [[rhetoric]] ''Gutmensch'' is used as a [[polemic|polemic term]]. See also [[Stereotype]] or [[Personality]].

==Context==

Users of the term believe that people or groups of people with a specific moral attitude show a wrong or problematic behaviour.&lt;ref name="knobloch"&gt;Clemens Knobloch: ''Moralisierung und Sachzwang. Politische Kommunikation in der Massendemokratie''. Duisburg 1998 (künftig: Knobloch: ''Moralisierung'').&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it was used as a popular term in the 1980s for people who valued humanistic, [[altruistic]], but also religious and human goals in life higher than [[utilitarian]] ones. They organise their actions, politics as well as their lives accordingly.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt;

The term ''Gutmensch'' is also connected to the term [[political correctness]] and has been used in a derogatory manner since the mid 1990s. In general language use it is always used as a negatively connotated foreign appellation. A use that is meant in "a nice way" can often be found only in face-to-face conversations, such as the saying "to have a heart of gold", in generosity or in an extreme form of [[altruism]].&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katrin Auer: [http://www.oezp.at/pdfs/2002-3-04.pdf "'Political Correctness' – Ideologischer Code, Feindbild und Stigmawort der Rechten."] (PDF; 103&amp;nbsp;kB). In: ''[[Österreichische Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft]]''. Volume 31, Nr. 3, 2002, pp. 291–303, especially p. 294; further: Knobloch: ''Moralisierung'';{{full citation needed|date=July 2016}} Gesa von Leesen: "'Das sagt man nicht!' Political Correctness zwischen Moral und Kampfbegriff". In: ''Das Parlament''. 1 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also hints at the possible difference between "meant well" and "well done". ''Gutmenschen'' have good intentions, want to solve specific problems or have the desire to create a better world. Those who use the term ''Gutmensch'' in a negative way evaluate the actions of ''Gutmenschen'' as not appropriate or unnecessary. This is how the term is used in everyday language. The German dictionary [[Duden]], which included the term in 2000, defines ''Gutmensch'' as "a naive person who acts in an uncritical, exaggerated or tedious way while fighting for political correctness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Gutmensch] in duden.de, accessed 24 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and use ==
According to researcher Rembert Hüser, the term ''Gutmensch'' was coined as a joke made by German feuilleton writers of the "generation 1989", such as [[Matthias Horx]] and [[Klaus Bittermann]]. They were among the authors of dictionaries opposing the [[protests of 1968]]. These dictionaries were written in the style of ''Eckardt Henscheids Dummdeutsch'' dictionary (dealing with language criticism) and can be considered a combination of popular and political literature. They did not differentiate between the meaning of a word and how it is used. Bittermann explains in his epilogue of the ''Wörterbuch des Gutmenschen'' (dictionary of the ''Gutmensch''):

{{quote|Literary scientist [[Karl Heinz Bohrer]] wrote at the end of his commentaries, in which he argued against the "terror of conciliation exerted by the provinciality of the Federal Republic of Germany": 'Maybe it would be best, if the [[Merkur (magazine)|Merkur]] established a little dictionary of the ''Gutmensch'', including entries like ''tearing down the wall in our minds'', ''constructive debates'', ''weird thinking'' or ''stubbornness''. We have long been waiting for that to happen, in vain as it turns out. Since things have not improved, we feel like we have to take care of that matter ourselves.'|ref=&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Bittermann (Hrsg.): ''Das Wörterbuch des Gutmenschen. Betroffenheitsjargon und Gesinnungskitsch''. München 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since the mid 1990s, ''Gutmensch'' has been used alongside [[political correctness]]&lt;ref&gt;Z.&amp;nbsp;B. von [[Reinhard Günzel (general)|Reinhard Günzel]], siehe dort.&lt;/ref&gt; in political and ideological debates, in order to degrade political opponents as over-moralizing.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Auer: ''"Political Correctness"'', p. 294; Brigitta Huhnke: "'political correctness' – ein Mantra nationaler Erweckung". In: ''ZAG'' 30, 1999 (also in: ''[http://www.zag-berlin.de/antirassismus/archiv/30politicalcorrectness.html ZAG Online]''); Brigitta Huhnke: "'pc' – Das neue Mantra der Neokonservativen". In: Andreas Disselnkötter u.&amp;nbsp;a. (eds.): ''Evidenzen im Fluß. Demokratieverluste in Deutschland''. Duisburg 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former ''[[Merkur (magazine)|Merkur]]'' publisher Kurt Scheel once claimed to have used the term first in that sense.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to the editor by Karl Scheel in the ''[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]'', 19 November 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Herberg u.&amp;nbsp;a.: ''Neuer Wortschatz: Neologismen der 90er Jahre im Deutschen.'' Berlin 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nwzq-xXllkAC&amp;pg=PA148 pp. 148 ''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gutmensch'' was considered the "latest critical chic" in the art sections of newspapers. Writers, like Klaus Bittermann, came up with a variety of [[neologism]]s referring to [[political correctness|PC]] and accompanying the appearance of ''Gutmensch''. Some of them can roughly be translated as ''Gutmensch language'', ''bleeding-heart language'', ''attitudinal kitsch'', ''attitudinal language'' or ''chatter jargon''.

In 2006, the [[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband|German Journalists Association]] claimed that the term ''Gutmensch'' had its origins in [[Nazi Germany]]. Following that claim, the association planned on including the term in a handbook on the sensitive use of language for journalists, which they wanted to publish in cooperation with the Duisburg Institute of Language and Social Studies.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum"&gt;Jürgen Hoppe/[[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband]]: {{cite web |url=http://www.djv-nrw.de/bilder/Memorandum27.03.06.pdf |title=Memorandum zur "Initiative Journalisten gegen Rassismus" |accessdate=2016-07-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101946/http://www.djv-nrw.de/bilder/Memorandum27.03.06.pdf |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}, 27 March 2006 (accessed 26 October 2007; PDF; 27&amp;nbsp;kB).&lt;/ref&gt; However, some time later the Institute explicitly objected to that claim made by the [[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband|DJV]]. Having conducted their own research on this topic, the Institute concluded that there was no clear connection between ''Gutmensch'' and Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diss-duisburg.de/2011/11/das-stigma-gutmensch/#footnote_1_1036 DISS-Journal] des Duisburger Instituts für Sprach- und Sozialforschung&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in a pre-published sample of the above-mentioned handbook, it was stated that ''Gutmensch'' had been introduced by the Nazis to refer to followers of [[Clemens August Graf von Galen|Cardinal von Galen]], who had openly opposed the [[Action T4|Nazi programme of forced euthanasia]]. According to the [[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband|DJV]], ''Gutmensch'' was derived from the [[Yiddish]] expression "a gutt Mensch" (a good human). Furthermore, they indicated that it was [[Adolf Hitler]], who in his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' had repeatedly used the prefix "gut" (good) in a derogatory way, so as to accuse people who expressed goodwill and good-heartedness of collaborating with the German enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Adolf Hitler: ''Mein Kampf''. Dort als die "Gutmeinenden" oft synonym für "die Juden", aber auch für Deutsche, die sich nicht eindeutig für oder gegen die nationalsozialistische "Bewegung" entscheiden können. Wie im Falle Nietzsches konnte jedoch auch hier keine Verwendung des Wortes "Gutmensch" dokumentiert werden.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another widespread opinion on where ''Gutmensch'' originates, is that it was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] who coined it.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt; There are numerous disparaging remarks in Nietzsche's writings concerning the "good human", albeit not as a fixed expression. The [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache|Association for the German Language]] mentions as their first source a 1985 edition of the [[Forbes|Forbes magazine]], in which Franz Steinkühler, at that time co-chairman of Germany's biggest [[IG Metall|metalworker's union]], is called a ''Gutmensch''.&lt;ref name="gfds"&gt;Gesellschaft für Deutsche Sprache zum ersten Aufscheinen des Begriffs im Deutschen: [http://gfds.de/gutmensch/ ''Fragen und Antworten: Gutmensch''].&lt;/ref&gt;

A more positive link may be [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s play ''[[The Good Person of Szechwan]]'' ({{lang-de|Der gute Mensch von Sezuan|links=no}}) whose main theme is the difficulty of acting good in a world that is not good.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaterbremen.de/de_DE/spielplan/der-gute-mensch-von-sezuan.1090429 Theaterbremen: Der gute Mensch von Sezuan] (accessed 2 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Die Welt]]'' journalist Matthias Heine brings into play German pedagogical scientist Christian Oeser, who may have invented the term. In Oeser's book "Letters to a Maiden on the most fundamental Topics of Aesthetics", published in 1859, he writes about naive ''Gutmenschen'' as follows: "Isn't it clear that in the end, such a gullible ''Gutmensch'' will be laughed at for his unconditional love towards humans, that the whole world will call him a fool and that he will eventually fall prey to his own weakness?"&lt;ref name=mh /&gt;

It is worth mentioning that similar terms can be found in other languages as well, for example the Italian ''buonismo'',  with meanings all referring to the ''Gutmensch''.

===In areas critical of society===

Occasionally, people who see themselves as critics of society ironically condemn would-be campaigners who criticize society without applying the same criteria to themselves. The term ''Gutmensch'' sees criticism of [[racism]] as symbolic when the speakers own racist behaviour is not reflected. That kind of criticism means that political utterances which don’t demand consequences are only made to allow the speaker to appear in a good light. Especially Sunday speeches of politicians will be criticized, if they pretend to be advocates for "victims". People who are concerned determinedly reject a locking up into a role as victim.&lt;ref&gt;Siehe Susan Arndt: ''Weißsein. Die verkannte Strukturkategorie Europas und Deutschlands'' und ''Mythen des weißen Subjekts: Verleugnung und Hierarchisierung von Rassismus''. In: Maureen Maisha Eggers u.&amp;nbsp;a. (Hrsg.): ''Mythen, Masken und Subjekte. Kritische Weißseinsforschung in Deutschland''. Münster 2005, pp. 24–29 and p. 340–362.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "friend of foreigners", having good intentions, is a specific example. According to [[humanism|humanistic]] approaches, they think everyone is equal, but foreigners impose their "own needs, ethical and moral ideas and goals" on him (''jemandem etwas aufzwingen, aufdrängen'') Sabine Forschner).&lt;ref&gt;See also Susan Arndt: "Mythen des weißen Subjekts: Verleugnung und Hierarchisierung von Rassismus". In: Maureen Maisha Eggers u.&amp;nbsp;a. (eds.): ''Mythen, Masken und Subjekte. Kritische Weißseinsforschung in Deutschland''. Münster 2005, pp. 340–362&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norbert Bolz]] ([[TU Berlin]]), an academic in media and communication, said in a radio station [[Deutschlandfunk]] on 11 August 2014:

{{quote|''Gutmenschen'' are people who have oral presentation techniques that have been given a name in the last couple of decades, i.e. political correctness. This political correctness can be described precisely and therefore also the ''Gutmensch'' is described; it is composed of political moralisation, from a kind of hygiene of speech, with a vast amount of speech taboo and furthermore, also from a kind of frigidly puritan attitude.|ref=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eben mal die Welt retten!|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.deutschlandradiokultur.de/gutmenschen-eben-mal-die-welt-retten.976.de.html?dram:article_id=294305|format=|accessdate=2015-05-2015|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}} Deutschlandfunk, 11 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In political debates==

The term is used with a different purpose and frequency in the overall political spectrum, i.e. as a polemic term in a discussion with (actual and would-be) representatives of a "political correctness", but mainly in the field of conservativeness, rightwing populism and rightwing totalitarianism.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auer: ''"Political Correctness"'', p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In political rhetoric===

The [[political right]] use the term more often in order to discrediting political opposites. By downgrading "left" ideals to "do-goodism", they emphasise the claim to argue in an own realistic way and on a factual level while the ''Gutmensch'' are implied to have lost touch with reality, to have a weak [[Human self-reflection|reflecting capacity]], an unrealistic and high claim or [[Utopia|utopian ideas]].&lt;ref name="knobloch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auer: ''"Political Correctness"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Leesen: ''"Das sagt man nicht!"''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Klonovsky]], for example, chief executive at German news magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'', accused:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Klonovsky: [http://www.focus.de/wissen/bildung/theologie/debatte-das-gott-wort-der-guten_aid_536776.html ''Das Gott-Wort der Guten.''] In: ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'', 31, 2 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The ''Gutmensch'' finds the fact outrageous that there is an unproductive lower class, a benefit-scrounging scum, that there is [[plebs]]. Therefore, he declares everyone of being bad who points it out to someone. If it is, on top of everything, an economic migrant, the popular accusation of racism and xenophobia is coming very likely into practice in the same way as the user of the term settles far from social inner cities.}}

People who are offended in such a way see this as a rhetoric trick, which ridicules their striving for [[humanism]], [[solidarity]] and [[social equity]]. Seeing the counterpart as ''Gutmensch'' took the discussion to a personal (''[[argumentum ad hominem]]'' = "ad personam") and emotional level, in order to avoiding a discussion on a content level.&lt;ref name="knobloch" /&gt;

The term is often used as an aggressive defense strategy against criticism on personal positions. Potential criticism on (factual or putative) racist, [[Homophobia|homophobic]], anti-semitic (and increasing also anti-Islamic) or [[sexism|sexual]] violations taboos is debilitated by downgrading the person with those rhetoric strategies.&lt;ref name="knobloch" /&gt;

===Moralistic strategy===

In political discussions the usage of the term ''Gutmensch'' gains a moral polarized shape, which is convenient to decrease the respect of the political opponent and to discredit them. There are strategies in political rhetoric to discuss political topics either on a factual level or on a moral level. [[Social stigma|Stigmatizations]] of political opponents by using terms like "[[political correctness|pc]]" (political correctness) or ''Gutmensch'' moralize communications. Therefore, the position of the political opponent is discredited and he is forced to change position, if he doesn`t want to lose reputation. Especially obvious becomes the strategy, if there are actual or claimed [[taboos]]. The art of the rhetoric is working when terms like ''Gutmensch'' or "moralizing prig" bring the political opponent in discussions into situations where the reply is supposed to say "my opinion or the tabooed view". This rhetoric proves as effective, because only under difficult circumstances can factual matters be discussed analytically. [[Clemens Knobloch]] ([[Universität Siegen]]) refers to this relationship.

===As "ideological code"===

According to a discourse analytical survey, which was published by political scientist Katrin Auer in the [[Österreichische Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft|Österreichischen Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft]] (ÖZP), are especially topics placed by the political right under the [[cipher]] "pc" (the term coming up usually because of ''Gutmenschen'') of which the society was not able to talk openly without falling victim to the "terror of ''Gutmenschen''". ''Gutmenschen'' thereby revealed were often pictured club swinging, in this context talking about "moralizing prig", "racist prig", "fascist prig", "Auschwitz prig" or similar, so Auer. Therefore, a concept of the enemy and a concept of the taboo came up, in which in particular misogynist, racist and [[anti-Semitic]] comments appeared rebellious and taboo breaking, it was said in the article. The term ''Gutmensch'' functioned here as code in order to being able to talk and being understood in this paradigm without having to expose one's own attitude, Auer adds. A well-known example was to replace the word "Jew" by the term ''Gutmensch'' in anti-Semitic speeches. Parts of the audience which understood themselves not as anti-Semitic, were allowed to agree without hesitation, concludes Katrin Auer.&lt;ref&gt;Auer: [http://www.oezp.at/pdfs/2002-3-04.pdf ''Political Correctness.''], pp. 294, 300 (PDF; 103&amp;nbsp;kB).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further use ==

===Until 20th century===
''Gutmenschen'', then called bonhommes or boni homines, was a term used for members of the heretic movement in medieval times. They were also referred to as [[Catharism|Cathars]], but for themselves they used the name ''veri christiani'' (true Christians). Aside from the derogatory use, the French term ''bonhomme'' (good person) did carry a positive connotation at times, ascribing moral qualities just as the English term ''[[gentleman]]'' does. On the other hand, it was non other than [[Karl Marx]] who used ''bonhomme'' in a derisive manner. He polemically wrote about "Jacque le bonhomme", which was a disguise for mocking [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Engels: ''Marx-Engels-Werke.'' 3, pp. 121–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harald Martenstein ===
German author and journalist [[Harald Martenstein]] developed his own definition of ''Gutmensch'' after repeatedly having dealt with the term ''[[wikt:shitstorm|shitstorm]]'' (in German exclusively referring to an [[internet meme]]) in his writings. In 2015, he proposed using ''Gutmensch'' to describe people who act aggressive and [[Self-righteousness|self-righteous]] when fighting for what they think is the ''good cause'', unmindfully considering themselves being excluded from any set of social rules. ''Gutmenschen'', in that sense, believe that it is ok to be offensive, humiliating and to even exert violence.&lt;ref name="smü"&gt;Harald Martenstein: {{cite web|title=Über die Sehnsucht nach moralischer Überlegenheit|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.zeit.de/zeit-magazin/2015/12/harald-martenstein-moral-gutmensch|format=|accessdate=2015-05-13|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}, ''Zeit-Magazin'', 6 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Not even having publicized his proposal, Martenstein already received heavy criticism. Among the critics was [[Die Welt]] journalist Matthias Heine, who accused Martenstein of tempting the wrong people to over-use the word by putting too much of an emphasis on the term, therefore turning ''Gutmensch'' into an unusable word for those being of sound mind.&lt;ref name=mh&gt;Matthias Heine: {{cite web|title=Wer Gutmensch sagt, verdient sich seinen Shitstorm|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/article138678946/Wer-Gutmensch-sagt-verdient-sich-seinen-Shitstorm.html|accessdate=2015-05-13|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}, ''[[Die Welt]]'', 23 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, one year earlier, German writer [[Akif Pirinçci]] had called Martenstein a ''Gutmensch'' in his [[polemic]] ''Deutschland von Sinnen'' (Germany unhinged).&lt;ref name="kas"&gt;Harald Martenstein: {{cite web|title=Über Kritik von allen Seiten|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.zeit.de/zeit-magazin/2014/21/harald-martenstein-kritik|format=|accessdate=2015-05-13|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}} ''Zeit-Magazin'', 17 May 2014; Akif Pirinçci: ''Deutschland von Sinnen. Der irre Kult um Frauen, Homosexuelle und Zuwanderer.'' Manuscriptum, Waltrop 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-944872-04-9}}, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Martenstein was still rather in favor of the term, polemically explaining in his book ''Die neuen Leiden des alten M.'' (The New Suffering of Old M.): "As for good-doing and most things in general, it is a question of the dosage: when overdone it becomes totalitarian."&lt;ref name="nlam"&gt;Harald Martenstein: ''Die neuen Leiden des alten M. Unartige Beobachtungen zum deutschen Alltag.'' Bertelsmann Verlag, München 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-641-15077-8}}, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wordmark ''Gutmensch'' ==
In 2014, Patrick Orth, manager of German rock band [[Die Toten Hosen]], registered the [[wordmark]] ''Gutmensch''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/tote-hosen-sichern-sich-rechte-am-unwort-gutmensch-a-1072085.html Deutungshoheit: "Tote Hosen" sichern sich Rechte am Unwort "Gutmensch"], spiegel.de&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the band has been selling print T-shirts labeled "Gutmensch – No one likes us. We don't care!". 10 Euros per T-shirt are donated to an organisation helping migrant crime victims.

==''Unwort des Jahres''==

Germany annually nominates a populist word that has a bad connotation. It is called "[[Un-word of the year|Unwort des Jahres]]" (in German the prefix Un- can be added to certain nouns, denoting undesirability and depreciating the original meaning). The jury consists of four German linguists and one journalist, who are independent and change every year.

''Gutmensch'' was nominated in 2011 (second position) and 2015 (first position).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sprachkritik: ''Gutmensch'' ist Unwort des Jahres|trans-title=|periodical=Spiegel Online|publisher=|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/gutmensch-ist-unwort-des-jahres-2015-a-1071545.html|accessdate=2016-01-12|last=|date=2016-01-12|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 the jury stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;By using the term the ethical idea of the good man is picked up maliciously in internet forums in order to vilify all dissidents without considering their arguments. The term "Wutbürger" (enraged people) is used in a similar way, although the term ''Gutmensch'' violates principles of democracy (...). The term has been used in that way for already 20 years. However, it has gained more influence in different socio-political contexts in 2011 and has therefore increased its potential of vilifying dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwortdesjahres.net/fileadmin/unwort/download/pressemitteilung_unwort2011_01.pdf "Pressemitteilung: Unwort des Jahres 2011"], 17 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statement in 2015 said that the term is connected to the refugee crisis. Here, especially those are insulted who voluntarily help refugees or stand against refugee asylums attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwortdesjahres.net/fileadmin/unwort/download/pressemitteilung_unwort2011_01.pdf Pressemitteilung der Jury]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wahl des 25.

The term ''Gutmensch'' was selected because "readiness to help others" vilified everyone who helped as naive, stupid and unworldly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/-gutmensch-ist-unwort-des-jahres-1.2814403 ''"Gutmensch" ist Unwort des Jahres 2015.''] ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 12 Januar 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism was not only against populists of the right, but also against journalists of important media channels who would use the term "Gutmensch".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/kultur/2016-01/unwort-des-jahres-2015-gutmensch ''Gutmensch ist Unwort des Jahres''], ''[[Die Zeit]]'', 12 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research|date=March 2010}}
A '''happy ending''' is an ending of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a work of [[fiction]] in which almost everything turns out for the best for the [[protagonists]], their [[sidekick]]s, and almost everyone except the [[villain]]s.

In storylines where the protagonists are in physical [[Risk|danger]], a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the [[quest]] or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers [[Consummation|consummating]] their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s version of "[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]", the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; ''and'' the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience's feeling of satisfaction in the end. 

A happy ending is epitomized in the standard [[fairy tale]] ending phrase, "'''happily ever after'''" or "and they lived happily ever after". (''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' has the more restrained formula "they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness" (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with "they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day".) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', [[Luke Skywalker]] defeats the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] by destroying the [[Death Star]]; however, the story's happy ending has consequences that follow in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the [[Stephen King]] fantasy/fairy tale novel ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that "there were good days and bad days" afterwards.

==Features==
A happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. [[Roger Ebert]] comments in his review of [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'': "Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and lots of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall's little [[cancer]] patient."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040528/REVIEWS/405280303/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Day After Tomorrow'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===William Shakespeare===
The presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish [[melodrama]] from [[tragedy]].  In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as ''[[Macbeth]]'' or ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked.  In the Seventeenth Century, the Irish author [[Nahum Tate]] sought to improve [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' in [[The History of King Lear|his own heavily modified version]] in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate's version dominated performances for a century and a half, Shakespeare's original nearly forgotten. Both [[David Garrick]] and [[John Philip Kemble]], while taking up some of Shakespeare's original text, kept Tate's happy ending. [[Edmund Kean]] played ''King Lear'' with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did [[William Macready]] at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare's original tragic end – [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]]'s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play's tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate's amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare's original. Happy endings have also been fastened – equally, with no lasting success – to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. 

There is no universally accepted definition of what a happy ending is; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''{{'}}s forced conversion of [[Shylock]] to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience's prejudices.

===Don Juan===

Most interpretations of the [[legend]] of [[Don Juan]] end with the protagonist [[Rake (stock character)|rake]] being dragged off to [[Hell]], in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''). However, [[José Zorrilla]] - whose 1844 [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' is the version most well-known in the Spanish-speaking world - believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla's depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Doña Inés, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan's - thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to [[Paradise]].

===Novels===
A ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review of ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' strongly criticized [[John le Carré]] for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal  reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: "''The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.''"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', September 13, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Bernard Shaw]] had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his "[[Pygmalion (play)#Ending|Pygmalion]]" have a happy ending, i.e. that Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolitle would ultimately get married.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, T.F. (ed.) (1997). ''George Bernard Shaw (The Critical Heritage Series).'' {{ISBN|0-415-15953-9}}, pp. 223–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"From the Point of View of A Playwright," by Bernard Shaw, collected in ''Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Some Memories of Him and His Art, Collected by Max Beerbohm'' (1919). London: Hutchinson. [https://archive.org/details/herbertbeerbohmt00beer Versions at Text Archive] [https://archive.org/about/about.php Internet Archive]&lt;!--Retrieved from http://archive.org November 2[[3, 2009.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To Shaw's great chagrin, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] who presented the play in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1914 had sweetened the ending and told Shaw: "My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful. Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard, edited by Dan H. Laurence. Collected Letters vol. III: 1911–1925.&lt;/ref&gt; The irritated Shaw added a postscript essay, "'What Happened Afterwards",&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, G.B. (1916). ''Pygmalion''. New York: Brentano. [http://www.bartleby.com/138/6.html Sequel: What Happened Afterwards.] [http://www.bartleby.com/sv/welcome.html Bartleby: Great Books Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1916 print edition, for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why in his view it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married. Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film "[[My Fair Lady]]".

===Hollywood films===

In numerous cases, [[Hollywood]] studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. 
* [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel, ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ended with the deaths of [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Elizabeth Lavenza]]. In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaption]] they survive and  marry. 
* [[C. S. Forester]]'s 1935 novel ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' has a British couple, stranded in Africa during the [[First World War]], hatch a plot to sink a German gunboat; they make an enormous, dedicated struggle, with boundless effort and sacrifice, but at the last moment their quest ends with failure and futility. In the [[The African Queen (film)|1951 film adaptation]] they succeed, and get to see the German boat sink (just in time to save them from being hanged by the Germans). 
* [[Truman Capote]]'s [[1958 in literature|1958]] [[novella]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' ended with the main character, Holly Golightly, going her own solitary way and disappearing from the male protagonist's life. In the 1961 [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)| film made on its base]] she finally accepts the love he offers her and the film ends with their warmly embracing, oblivious of a pouring rain.
* [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ends with the protagonist mermaid making a noble sacrifice, resigned to seeing her beloved prince marrying another woman. In the 1989 [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)| Disney adaptation]], the mermaid does get to happily marry her prince. Disney later added [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea |a sequel]], obviously impossible for the Andersen original, focused on the child born of that marriage.

'''''Histopathology''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[medical journal]] covering diagnostic, research, and surgical [[pathology]]. It was established in 1977 and is published monthly by [[Wiley-Blackwell]]. It is currently edited by Alastair Burt. Histopathology is an international journal intended to be of practical value to surgical and diagnostic histopathologists, and to investigators of human disease who employ histopathological methods. The primary purpose is to publish advances in pathology, in particular those applicable to clinical practice and contributing to the better understanding of human disease.

Both the number of subscribers and the amount of papers accepted for publication have increased rapidly since Histopathology's launch in 1977. It publishes histopathological material having clinical application in the study of human disease and includes electron microscopic histochemical, immunological and supportive experimental studies where necessary. The readership consists of diagnostic histopathologists and researchers in the clinicopathological field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4104">[[Image:Hock.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Diagram showing the location of the hock.]]
The '''hock''', or '''gambrel''', is the joint between the [[tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal bones]] and [[tibia]] of a [[digitigrade]] or [[unguligrade]] [[quadrupedal]] mammal, such as a [[horse]], [[cat]], or [[dog]].   This joint may include articulations between tarsal bones and the [[fibula]] in some species (such as cats), while in others the fibula has been greatly reduced and is only found as a [[Vestigiality|vestigial]] remnant fused to the distal portion of the tibia (as in horses) {{citation needed|date=January 2016}}.  It is the anatomical [[Homology (biology)|homologue]] of the [[ankle]] of the human [[foot]].  While homologous joints occur in other [[tetrapod]]s, the term is generally restricted to mammals, particularly long-legged [[domestic animals|domesticated species]].

==Horse==
Although the ''tarsus'' refers specifically to the bones and joints of the hock, most people working with horses refer to the ''hock'' in such a way to include the bones, joints, and soft tissue of the area. The hock is especially important in [[equine anatomy]], due to the great strain it receives when the horse is worked. Jumping, and movements that require collection, are some of the more stressful activities.

===Primary joints and bones of the hock===
In the horse, the hock consists of multiple joints, namely:
*Tibiotarsal or tarsocrural joint
*Proximal intertarsal joint or talocalcanealcentroquartal joint
*Distal intertarsal joint or centrodistal joint
*Tarsometatarsal joint
*Talocalcaneal joint

In the horse, the hock consists of the following bones
*[[Talus bone|Talus]]
*[[Calcaneus]]
*Central [[tarsus (skeleton)|tarsal]] bone
*3rd tarsal bone
*3rd metatarsal bone
*4th tarsal bone
*Fused 1st and 2nd tarsal bone

===Equine disease states===
*Horses may suffer from  "capped hock", which is caused by the creation of a false [[bursa (anatomy)|bursa]], a [[synovial bursa|synovial]] sac beneath the skin. Capped hock is usually caused by [[Blunt trauma|trauma]] such as kicking or slipping when attempting to stand. In the absence of a wound, it does not require immediate veterinary attention and is usually only of cosmetic significance. On the other hand, a wound into the calcanean bursa is a serious problem. A capped hock is extremely unlikely to be a cause of [[lameness (equine)|lameness]], even if severe.
*[[Osteochondrosis dissecans]], or OCD is a developmental defect in the cartilage or of cartilage and bone seen in particular locations on the surface of the tarsocrural joint.  This condition is typically discovered when the horse is young, and is one cause of [[bog spavin]].  After surgery to remove bone and cartilage fragments most horses can return to full work.
*Distension of the tibiotarsal joint with excessive joint fluid and/or [[synovium]] is called [[bog spavin]].
*Degenerative joint disease of the tarsometatarsal or distal intertarsal joint is referred to as [[bone spavin]].
*[[Curb (horse)|Curb]], or tarsal plantar desmitis, is traditionally considered a sprain of the plantar ligament, which runs down the back of the hock, serving functionally as a tension band connecting the calcaneus, the fourth tarsal bone and the fourth metatatarsal bone.  Recent work has shown that curb can be caused by damage to one of many soft tissue structures in this region.

===Conformational defects===
''Also see [[equine conformation]]''

Because the hock takes a great deal of strain in all performance disciplines, correct [[equine conformation|conformation]] is essential if the horse is to have a sound and productive working life. Common conformational defects include [[sickle-hocked|sickle hocks]], [[post-legged]] conformation/straight hocks, [[cow-hocked|cow hocks]], and bowed hocks. Depending on the use of the horse, some defects may be more acceptable than others.

'''Homesteading''' is a lifestyle of [[self-sufficiency]]. It is characterized by [[subsistence agriculture]], home preservation of food, and may also involve the small scale production of textiles, clothing, and craftwork for household use or sale. Pursued in different ways around the world—and in different historical eras—homesteading is generally differentiated from rural village or [[commune]] living by isolation (either socially or physically) of the homestead.  Use of the term in the [[United States]] dates back to the [[Homestead Act]] (1862) and before. In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], particularly in nations formerly controlled by the [[British Empire]], a homestead is the household compound for a single extended family. In the UK, the term '[[Smallholding|smallholder]]' or '[[Crofters|crofts]]' is the rough equivalent of 'homesteader'.

Modern homesteaders often use [[renewable energy]] options including [[Solar power|solar electricity]] and [[wind power]]. Many also choose to plant and grow [[Heirloom plant|heirloom vegetables]] and to raise heritage livestock. Homesteading is not defined by where someone lives, such as the city or the country, but by the lifestyle choices they make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Niemann|first1=Deborah|title=Homegrown and Handmade: A Practical Guide to More Self-Reliant Living|date=2011|publisher=New Society Publishers|isbn=978-0-86571-702-2|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As historical governmental policy==

{{further|Homestead Acts|Dominion Lands Act}}
Historically, homesteading has been used by governmental entities (engaged in national expansion) to help populate and make habitable what were previously little-desired areas; especially in the United States, Canada, and Australia. Guided by legal ''[[homestead principle]]s'', many of these "homestead acts" were instituted in the 19th and 20th centuries in order to drive the populating of specific, national areas; with most being discontinued after a set time-frame or goal were achieved.

Renewed interest in homesteading was brought about by U.S. President  [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s program of [[Subsistence Homesteads Division|Subsistence Homesteading]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==As a social movement==

The attractiveness of [[back-to-the-land]] movements dates from the Roman era, and has been noted in Asian poetry and philosophy tracts as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wholeearth.com/issue/1340/article/69/vital.cities.an.interview.with.jane.jacobs|title=Vital Cities: an interview with Jane Jacobs - Tools Ideas Environment - Whole Earth Catalog|website=www.wholeearth.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas of modern homesteading proponents, such as [[Ralph Borsodi]], gained in popularity in the 1960s in the United States. Self-sufficiency movements in the 1990s and 2000s began to apply the concept to urban and suburban settings, known as [[urban homesteading]]. According to author [[John Seymour (author)|John Seymour]], "urban homesteading" incorporates small-scale, [[sustainable agriculture]] and [[homemaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waldeneffect.org/blog/Why_homestead__63__/|title=Why homestead?|last=Anna|website=www.waldeneffect.org|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As economic choice==

In homesteading, social and government support systems are frequently eschewed in favor of [[Self-sufficiency|self-reliance]] and relative deprivation, in order to maximize independence and self-determination. The degree of independence occurs along a spectrum, with many homesteaders creating foodstuffs or crafts to appeal to high-end niche markets in order to meet financial needs. Other homesteaders come to the lifestyle following successful careers which provide the funding for land, [[housing]], [[taxes]], and specialized equipment such as [[Solar panel|solar panels]], [[Agricultural machinery|farm equipment]] and [[Electric generator|electricity generators]].

Modern government regulation—in the form of building codes, food safety codes, zoning regulations, minimum wage and social security for occasional labor, and town council restrictions on landscaping and animal keeping— can increase the marginal cost of home production of food in areas affected by these restrictions. Careful choice of homesteading location is essential for economic success.

Actual financial savings from adopting a homesteading lifestyle can be significant if planned and executed properly. Many homesteaders express deep satisfaction with their standard of living and feel that their lifestyle is healthier and more rewarding than more conventional patterns of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theelliotthomestead.com/2014/01/great-benefits-of-homesteading/|title=Great Benefits of Homesteading. - The Elliott Homestead|work=The Elliott Homestead|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.offthegridnews.com/how-to-2/3-priceless-benefits-of-modern-homesteading/|title=3 Priceless Benefits Of Modern Homesteading  {{!}} Off The Grid News|website=www.offthegridnews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS epidemic===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in the United States}}
{{See also|History of HIV/AIDS}}

In May 1983, when ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was published, the AIDS epidemic in New York City has only recently begun and panic about the unknown causes, means of transmission and potential for treatment for AIDS was spreading rapidly.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; The misconception that there was something inherent in the lifestyle of all gay men that put them at risk for infection was common at the time and led to the development of a [[Social stigma|stigma]] surrounding both the disease and [[Gay sexual practices|gay sex]].&lt;ref name=prom&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3397576 |jstor=3397576 |title=How to Have Promiscuity in an Epidemic |journal=October |volume=43 |pages=237 |year=1987 |last1=Crimp |first1=Douglas }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor Sonnabend wrote that "it may be impossible for those who did not directly experience the uncertainty and terror of the early years of AIDS to appreciate the circumstances under which these guidelines [for safe sex] were constructed."&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;

At the time when ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was written, there was no consensus on the cause of AIDS, but two main theories existed: the "new agent theory," which was increasingly the scientific consensus, and the "multifactorial theory," which Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend adopted as their basis for [[sexual education]] around AIDS transmission prevention. The new agent theory proposed that AIDS was caused by a single, previously unknown [[pathogen]], likely a [[retrovirus]] similar to the [[Human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV).&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; According to the multifactorial theory, however, continual overexposure to [[semen]], specifically [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) in semen, lead to an eventual state of [[immunosuppression]] that characterized AIDS.&lt;ref name=multi&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1984.tb37134.x |pmid=6100000 |title=A Multifactorial Model for the Development of Aids in Homosexual Men |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=437 |pages=177–83 |year=1984 |last1=Sonnabend |first1=Joseph A |last2=Witkin |first2=Steven S |last3=Purtilo |first3=David T }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was based on prior scientific studies that revealed the role that CMV can play in causing cellular immune-related abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;Holmberg, Scott D..''

As a result of the lack of agreement on AIDS cause and transmission, it was difficult to determine the risk of various forms of sexual contact. Berkowitz, in the introduction to his [[autobiography]], describes how, in the early years of the epidemic, [[risk]] categorizations were rewritten every few months: "anal sex with a condom became an endless back and forth [[dance]], from high risk to medium risk to low risk to possibly safe." &lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; It was this confusion that prompted the authors to create a safe sex manual that clearly outlined for men having sex with men the dangers of each type of contact and various methods to protect oneself from exposure.

===LGBT culture and politics===
{{Main|LGBT rights in the United States}}
{{See also|Media portrayal of HIV/AIDS}}

After the [[Sexual Revolution]] and the [[Gay Liberation]] in the 1960s and `70s, sex in urban gay epicenters was not only newly acceptable, but also often seen as key to gay identity and resistance to [[heteronormativity]]. AIDS brought up a renewed fear about negative media coverage and the [[civil rights]] violations that [[LGBT people]] might face from targeted quarantines and a denial of basic healthcare services.&lt;ref name=prom /&gt; As such, the issue of safe sex was a contentious one, and any arguments criticizing frequent sex were poorly received by the majority of the community.&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; A large sector of LGBT community leadership worried that raising awareness about AIDS and gay sex would be off-putting to the straight majority and damage the image of the subculture as a whole.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=escoffier&gt;Escoffier, Jeffrey (1998-99).

Retrieved 13 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Activists still deeply entrenched in the battle to protect the political gains of the past decade tended to overlook the AIDS crisis as a political attack, a topic too controversial to address, or an overreaction by self-hating gay men.&lt;ref name=trenches&gt;Sonnabend, Joseph.

The authors of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' were aware of the political risks they took in creating the booklet: Berkowitz noted in his autobiography the possibility that their writing could be used as ammunition by homophobic institutions and leaders.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; However, their advocacy was motivated by the increasingly critical state of the health crisis and their shared belief in what Callen described as the danger of "put[ting] political considerations over the tragedy of even a single gay man's death."&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;

Before the AIDS epidemic, condoms were mostly advertised and used for preventing pregnancies and therefore were not considered a viable safe sex or STD prevention tool among the LGBT community: David France estimates that less than 1% of men who have sex with men in New York City used them regularly in the 1970s, despite the fact that many other sexually transmitted diseases, including cytomegalovirus and [[hepatitis B]], were already at "endemic" levels.&lt;ref name=france /&gt; Sonnabend writes about condoms at the time: "I think most gay men said, 'Oh thank god, that's one thing we don't have to worry about,'"&lt;ref name=france /&gt; and many didn't know how to use one.&lt;ref&gt;Baumann, Jason. "A Prophecy Before Our Time: The Gay Men's Health Project Clinic Opens in 1972, Part Two: A Wasted Opportunity" ''[[New York Public Library]].'' December 20, 2013. https://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/12/20/mens-health-project-clinic-opens-wasted-opportunity. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend would show them, condoms really were something to worry about and could be an easy way to prevent disease and death while continuing to have a normal and fulfilling sex life.

Along with ''Play Fair!'', its San Francisco counterpart written by a [[drag (clothing)|drag]] group called the [[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]], ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was the first [[sex-positive]] manuals for safe sex—in other words, it did not present sex in a negative, shameful or moralistic light. Sonnabend writes in the introduction to the booklet that one of their goals was to "explore the many different forms of sexual expression open to gay men."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; As [[David France (writer)|David France]] later recounted, the authors actively tried to avoid condescension or arrogance in their writing (despite the fact that Callen himself had acknowledged that telling people how to have sex is inherently an arrogant thing to do), instead attempting to establish a dialogue, "[[Queen (slang)|queen]] to queen," between themselves and the people for whom they created the manual.&lt;ref name=france /&gt;&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; Callen even educated himself about different [[philosophers]], including [[Hannah Arendt]], to get an idea of the best way to productively use writing to influence people through rhetoric and written arguments.&lt;ref name=france /&gt; The independent and community-driven nature of this approach to LGBT-related safe sex, according to [[Cindy Patton]], can be traced back to the "self-help model" promoted in the women's health movement.&lt;ref name=ACTUP&gt;Gould, Deborah B.

The primary message of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' is 1) to use [[Sexual protection|protection]] (i.e., condoms) during sex and 2) to limit the specific sex acts one performs to those with a lower risk of contagion. It was a model that attempted to challenge traditional anti-promiscuity and anti-gay viewpoints in previous safe sex education and AIDS prevention—as Callen and Berkowitz argued, it's what you do, not how often you do it or who you do it with. In other words, they had searched for, and come up with, what they termed the possibility of "life-affirming sex."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

The categories below contain summaries of the chapters of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' and the arguments presented therein:

=== What causes AIDS? ===
The authors introduce the two presiding theories of AIDS transmission and present their arguments for the multifactorial model. They describe the role of CMV in causing abnormalities in immune cells, as well as the potential for gradual immune overload by semen and harmful [[immune complexes]] resulting from the binding of [[antibodies]] to [[antigens]] on other STDs. This section presents evidence against the "new agent theory" but acknowledges that in either case, AIDS is likely sexually transmitted and therefore the best method of prevention will be the use of protection and more critical choice in which sexual acts to perform.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

=== CMV in connection with AIDS ===
In this section, Callen and Berkowitz elaborate on the multifactorial model to provide a basis for later applications of safe sex practices. They cite the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' study that found that traces of CMV were found in 94% of [[Men who have sex with men|MSM]] in a New York City cohort in 1981, but later estimate that CMV was present in ¼ of [[sexually active]] gay men in 1982-83, which, when factoring in the average frequency and diversity of partners in the population of sexually active gay men in New York City, would still amount to a high number of exposures per year.&lt;ref name="Gottlieb et al 1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; The reasoning behind their support of the multifactorial theory was the concurrent [[epidemics]] of AIDS and CMV in the same sexual networks and locations; they called it the "one common link found in all gay men with AIDS." They summarize the characteristics of CMV and its links to AIDS as the following:&lt;ref name=multi /&gt;
* Cytomegalovirus itself is a type of [[herpesvirus]] that is present in [[bodily fluids]].  
* It remains in the body for more than a year after the immune system has fought off its initial effects.  
* It often manifests again in people with severely compromised immune systems (i.e., those with AIDS).  
* It was also found in some KS tumors of people with AIDS, and can activate the [[Epstein Barr virus]], causing [[lymphoma]] and [[lymphadenopathy]] (both common symptoms of AIDS). 
* Like HIV, CMV has a [[latency period]] that makes it easily transmittable and impossible to discern when picking sexual partners.

This part of the manual stresses the fact that it's not a single infection putting people at risk, but instead repeated exposure to the virus in semen, particularly through anal-receptive intercourse. In addition to the specific cytomegalovirus in sperm, the authors argue that simply exposing the body to such high intake levels of sperm itself can present a health risk. Although the multifactorial model had been criticized for failing to account for the sudden appearance of AIDS, the authors use the fact that the rate of CMV infections in urban sexually active gay men rose significantly in last decade as evidence of the "new" component that accounts for the rapid increase in AIDS cases.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;&lt;ref name=multi /&gt; They advise readers to get tested for CMV and describe which tests to get (e.g. antibody tests or [[virus|viral]] isolation of CMV from [[urine]] and semen), but also acknowledge that the price of such tests ($200) and the fact that it was not routinely offered at traditional clinics and labs might make it inaccessible to most patients.

=== Ethics and responsibility ===
In this section, the authors stress the need for the gay male community to come together to protect itself.  A central component of this was that one's own sexual health and the health of others should "never became separated." They wrote that it was important to think about not only what sexual acts would put oneself in a risky position in terms of disease transmission, but also what would be dangerous for one's partner. They recognize the importance of maintaining mental control during sex, and argue that although it's easy to forget about safety in the heat of the moment, the growing threat of sickness and death should be enough to motivate people to act with foresight. Their primary piece of advice within the "control" subsection is not abstinence; instead, it centers around the importance of staying sober during sexual encounters in order to make informed decisions. This, Callen and Berkowitz write, means not drinking, smoking, or taking poppers before going clubbing. They also emphasize the importance of communication with one's partner in the broader discussion of maintaining control, including the need to talk about health concerns, disease status, and convince him to engage in whatever sexual acts safely.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

=== Risk categories ===
Much of the rest of the pamphlet is dedicated to discussing the many possible forms of sexual expression available to gay and bisexual men and providing a thorough analysis of the risk associated with each particular act. This analysis is warranted by the fact that, as the authors recognized, different diseases spread through different types of contact, and specifically AIDS/CMV (as they saw it back then) is much more easily transmitted through certain sex acts.

''Note that some of these categorizations are incorrect given current knowledge about HIV transmission, and the descriptions below should not be presumed to be the medical consensus.''&lt;ref name=ca&gt;Wilton, James (Fall 2012). "Putting a number on it: The risk from an exposure to HIV." CATIE: Canada's source for HIV and Hepatitis C information. http://www.catie.ca/en/pif/summer-2012/putting-number-it-risk-exposure-hiv. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;u&gt;Sucking (i.e. giving [[oral sex]]):&lt;/u&gt; The authors categorize sucking as having a "moderate" risk: although the exposure to semen is not as direct as when it is taken in anally, they state that oral sex, for the person coming into contact with semen, is not risk free (for CMV infection) except with condom use. The compromise they suggest is to avoid having your partner come in your mouth, and, if they do accidentally, to spit out the [[ejaculate]] to reduce the risk of transmission.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; 
* &lt;u&gt;Getting sucked (receiving oral sex):&lt;/u&gt; According to ''How to Have Sex,'' oral sex probably has no risk for the receiver, but there are still [[hygiene]] protocols such as washing, not coming in the person's mouth, etc. that someone in this position should follow to protect the health of his partner. Additionally, it is only risk free from the perspective of CMV/AIDS, as there are plenty of other pathogens that can be transmitted through oral sex.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; 
* &lt;u&gt;Fucking ([[Anal sex|anal penetrative/insertive]]):&lt;/u&gt; This is another position where the authors identified little to no risk for CMV transmission. Again, their main argument is that it is still necessary to wear a condom to protect one's partner, and, by extension, the sexually active community of men who have sex with men as a whole. Because condoms were not commonly used at the time, the authors conceded that if someone finds it difficult to get used to the sensation to the point where they are dissuaded from using a condom altogether, they should at least [[Coitus interruptus|pull out]] before coming to prevent exposing their partner to semen. They also point out the risk of condoms [[tearing]], particularly as most at the time were designed for vaginal, not anal, intercourse. David France recounts that while Callen and Berkowitz were ready to put all of anal sex into the "never again category" (i.e. high risk), Sonnabend, from his experience in clinical practice, was able to see that the people with the majority of the infections were those who were bottoms (i.e. those in the anal-receptive position), which then allowed him to discern a differential in risk depending on one's position in the sexual relationship.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;&lt;ref name=france /&gt; 
* &lt;u&gt;Getting fucked (i.e. anal-receptive):&lt;/u&gt; Being penetrated in unprotected anal sex was identified as the act with the greatest risk for contracting CMV, and, under the multifactorial model, AIDS. This follows naturally from the fact that anal sex results in the [[ejaculation]] of semen into the rectum, where it is easily absorbed by the [[mucosa]] into the [[bloodstream]]. Callen and Berkowitz made sure to acknowledge, however, that this statement about high risk is not a condemnation of [[bottom (sex)|bottom]]s/men who are penetrated in gay sex. The authors incorporate a feminist critique into the pamphlet, arguing that the ingrained concept that [[manliness]] is compromised in the act of being penetrated in gay sex can create a certain degree of [[defensiveness]] when it comes to accepting that this is inherently a more dangerous position to be in, in terms of contracting AIDS. This is a prime example of how ''How to Have Sex'' attempted to address every element of its education in a sex-positive and affirming way. "Remember that the issue is disease--not sex," they tell their readers.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Rimming]] (anal-oral):&lt;/u&gt; The authors identified this as a high risk activity, stating that there is no way to rim in a risk-free way without being in a [[monogamous relationship]] where both people have been tested. Their advice is to avoid it unless the above criteria are met.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Kissing]]:&lt;/u&gt; ''How to Have Sex'' describes kissing as an activity with moderate risk of CMV transmission, although this risk, they say, can be mitigated partially by kissing with closed lips. They discuss the social and emotional importance of kissing and the negative impact that avoiding it could have on the gay community.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;Low risk alternatives:&lt;/u&gt; The authors include various pieces of advice about how to change or moderate one's sexual behavior to avoid getting infected. Among these are [[masturbation]] and alternative methods of [[Sexual penetration|penetration]], including the use of [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingers]], [[Sex toy|toys]], [[dildos]], etc. They describe dildos as a good and relatively safe way to avoid contracting STDs, with the caveat that they be 1) flexible and relatively short to avoid wounds, 2) washed and disinfected regularly, and 3) not shared from person to person. They suggest ways of getting creative with mutual masturbation and jerk-off clubs, as well as "closed circles of fuck buddies," that create the possibility for safer but non-[[monogamous]] sex. They describe jerk-off clubs as typically having a friendly and welcoming atmosphere and clearly posted rules, and encourage their readers to ask around for these in their area or develop their own versions. However, Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend also acknowledge that the "closed circles," based on the concept that a group of uninfected people can freely have unprotected sex as long as they do so only within that same group, are very much reliant on the trustworthiness of all members and are therefore more risky than monogamy. Furthermore, it was difficult to determine one's HIV status at the time of the book's publishing, given that the virus itself hadn't even been isolated, much less an antibody test designed to diagnose infection.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Urolagnia|Water sports]] (sexual activity involving urine):&lt;/u&gt; Because CMV is found in high quantities in urine, ''How to Have Sex'' describes water sports as something to be avoided, particularly anything that resulted in urine inside the rectum.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Fisting]]:&lt;/u&gt; This activity, although it is described as "extremely dangerous" in other capacities, had no known connection to AIDS.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;Sadism and masochism:&lt;/u&gt; The authors take a positive stance on S&amp;M, but emphasize the importance of setting limits and using protection within this environment and limiting the acts one performs to avoid direct bodily fluid contact between people. Most important in this setting, they explain, is prior communication between the people involved about the need to have safe sex, which can naturally be incorporated into the customary setting of boundaries, [[safe words]], etc. that occurs in the context of S&amp;M.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;Washing up:&lt;/u&gt; Although this is not a sexual act, per se, Callen and Berkowitz stress the importance of washing with soap and water both before and after sex. They recommend Betadine soap with [[iodine]] and an [[antimicrobial]] soap scrub called [[Hibiclens]]. True to their sex-positive style, they recommend making showering part of the [[foreplay]].&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; 
* &lt;u&gt;"[[Backroom]]s, Bookstores, Balconies, Meatracks and Tearooms" and "[[BathHouse|The Baths]]":&lt;/u&gt; These locations, generally sites designed for [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] and casual, public sex, were a highly risky environment for disease spread of all kinds. Backrooms and similar spaces tend to be dark and have limited washing facilities. The authors recognize that it is still possible to have medically safe sex in these situations, only much more difficult. The solutions, then, as presented in ''How to Have Sex,'' are "talking, washing, light and rubbers." They recommend talking to one's potential partner, even something as simple as "been here long?" to scope out how potentially infectious the person is, as well as to communicate about one's safe sex preferences (be it using condoms, not performing certain acts, using dildos, etc.). The authors say that, if the person gets defensive (which is understandable, given that the implication is that he will give you a disease), you should politely move on. They strongly recommend going to a place with [[shower]] facilities and also suggest some form of examination of one's partner's body before sex as another assessment of their health; they write, "you don't have to be clinical. Make it a part of foreplay." Lastly, in these situations where sex is often anonymous, exchanging numbers is a good way to be able to keep track of one's sexual encounters and communicate should someone become infected—this is part of the more community-driven mindset that the authors wanted to promote around sex. Lastly, Berkowitz and Callen recognize that visiting the baths is habitual for many gay men, and discuss the strategy that some have been using of masturbating before going to give oneself more self control and prevent risky behavior.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt; 
* &lt;u&gt;[[Poppers]]:&lt;/u&gt; A common theory circulating in the early `80s was that the use of poppers (amyl and butyl nitrates), a common party drug in the LGBT nightclub scene, was a cofactor for AIDS transmission. However, the authors of ''How to Have Sex'' refute this idea, citing scientific proof vindicating the drug, although they also mention that there is a small transmission risk increase associated with taking poppers because it dilates the blood vessels, thus facilitating the entry of microorganisms.&lt;ref name=pop&gt;"Poppers." NAM AIDSMAP. https://www.aidsmap.com/Poppers/page/1322957/. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; They also draw attention to the dangers of poppers outside the realm of disease transmission, including the drugs' extreme toxicity when swallowed.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Prostitution|Buying sex]]:&lt;/u&gt; Callen and Berkowitz stress the importance sexual health in sex work, as well. To those in the position of paying for the sex, they say to make sure their partner respects their health concerns, or else look for someone else. They also warn their readers that, while escort services may claim that their employees are healthy, they cannot actually know for sure and cannot be entirely trusted.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;  
* &lt;u&gt;[[Hustling]]/selling sex:&lt;/u&gt; True to their sex-positive and nonjudgemental tone, the authors first acknowledge hustling as an important source of income for some men who have sex with men. Instead of condemning prostitution, they suggest that sex workers advertise protected sex specifically. They also recognize the unique difficulties posed for hustlers in prioritizing their sexual health because they are "in the business of satisfying others' needs" and emphasize the need to establish guidelines for safe sex before getting together. According to ''How to Have Sex,'' bilateral prevention of disease transfer in sex work is important in a [[global health]] context because sex workers were key to the national and international spread of AIDS.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

===Should people with AIDS have sex?===
Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend begin this section by stating that, regardless of how controversial and subjective the question may be, some people with AIDS do continue to have sex after being infected, whether knowingly or unknowingly, although many may be so incapacitated that sex is "the furthest thing from their minds." The solution, they argue, does not involve treating people with AIDS (PWA) like [[lepers]], as they are just as [[human]] as the rest of the population, desire the same human contact and will simply end up being unwilling to disclose their [[HIV status]] if automatic ostracism is the result. In all likelihood, the authors contend, the risk of unprotected sex to the person with AIDS is higher than to the uninfected person, as any number of STDs can have a dangerous health impact on someone with a compromised [[immune system]]. For a person with AIDS to go to the baths or backrooms would therefore be "extremely unwise."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

Based on the multifactorial model of AIDS transmission, the uninfected person would simply be at risk for being exposed to high levels of CMV-infected semen.&lt;ref name=multi /&gt;  However, the reality is that the risk of having sex with someone with AIDS is higher than they described because it is caused by a single virus (HIV) that PWA (and people with HIV pre-AIDS) have and uninfected people do not.&lt;ref name=ca /&gt;&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; Either way, they conclude in all capital letters that AIDS PATIENTS HAVE AN [[ETHICAL]] OBLIGATION TO ADVISE POTENTIAL PARTNERS OF THEIR HEALTH STATUS." It should be up to the uninfected person to make the informed decision to have sex, evaluating all the risk factors. However, sex between a PWA and an uninfected person, according to the pamphlet, would be fine if they are monogamous lovers and use protection. Given scientific evidence against casual transmission of AIDS, the authors saw no reason to discourage other forms of [[affection]] and touching.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

===Guilt, morality and sex negativity===
''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' stresses the importance of separating valid medical advice from moral-based arguments disguised as medicine. In this section, the authors discuss the difficulties posed by the obvious connection between gay sex and the disease, especially given that men who have sex with men, as well as [[transgender women]], were, even before the outbreak of AIDS, often accused of having too much sex by the [[Moral Majority]]. Advice during the initial stage of the epidemic was to "cut down" on the frequency of sex, without giving any thought to the type of sex. The authors describe their attempt to correct this incomplete advice by educating people on what types of sexual acts are higher risk as a way to present them with an alternative to [[abstinence]]/self-denial and encourage a sex-positive mentality.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

The example they provide in the pamphlet is a man who decides to limit the number of times he has sex to 12 per year, but does not change what he does with his partners or how he does it (e.g. with protection or not). The authors conclude that this will not prevent him from putting himself at high risk for contracting AIDS at some point during the year. They stress that sex is not a [[vice]], and therefore giving up sex to avoid getting AIDS is not the same as giving up [[smoking]] to avoid [[lung cancer]]. It should be noted that the advice to cut down on only the frequency of sex and sexual partners was even less productive under the "new virus model" as opposed to the multifactorial model.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

Callen and Berkowitz also bring up the fact that [[anonymity|anonymous]] sex was highly criticized by the straight majority, but telling one's partner one's name will not make a difference to the [[infectivity]] of the pathogen. However, they recognize anonymity during sex might make the issue of protecting one's partner from disease transmission less pressing and/or personally important.

This section of the manual also highlights the importance of talking to one's [[physicians]] and making sure the information one gets about the disease is reliable by looking at multiple [[source text|sources]] and doing individual [[research]]. They conclude: "If we are to celebrate our gayness and get on with [[Gay Liberation]], we must stay healthy. To stay healthy, we must realize that the issue isn't gayness or sex; the issue is simply disease."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

===Love===
The penultimate section of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was added after both Sonnabend and Richard Dworkin read it over and were struck by the complete absence of the word "love" in a manual about safe sex.&lt;ref name=france /&gt;&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; Afterwards, the authors realized the potential it had as a moral and emotional justification for the use of protection and added this section, starting by admitting, "It came as quite a shock to us to find that we had written almost 40 pages on sex without mentioning the word "love" once." David France explain that Callen and Berkowitz both "cared deeply for their vast sexual communities" and Sonnabend agreed, saying, "you could really love somebody even for just four hours. Genuinely."&lt;ref name=france /&gt;&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;

In this section, the authors describe the years post-Sexual Revolution as a time when sex and love were accepted as being distinct and that STD epidemics were a product of this newfound freedom, not just within the LGBT community but everywhere. If one cares about one's partner or accepts sex as something that is "interpersonally meaningful," they argue, that should be motivation enough to use protection for the sake of both one's partner and oneself. The authors build on their feminist critique, claiming that the challenge facing the gay male community is to undo their "socialization as men" who are "trained to destroy" and to compete with one another and instead promote a community of people who take care of one another. Maybe, they argue, the goal of gay male liberation is to be able to love one's partner even when society teaches them not to. "Men loving men was the basis of gay male liberation, but we have now created 'cultural institutions' in which love or even affection can be totally avoided," they write. They also pose the question to their readers: "Have we modified the belief that we could [[dance]] our way to liberation into the belief that we could somehow fuck our way there?" They end with this statement: "If you Love the person you are fucking with -- even for one night -- you will not want to make them sick. Maybe affection is our best protection."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

===Conclusion===
In the pamphlet's short section of "closing thoughts," the authors reiterate that "the party of the `70s is over" and that ignorance in the baths and backrooms has now turned into a form of oppression. They add that, because many members of the LGBT community are not well educated or able to afford successive healthcare visits, it's doubly important to disseminate correct, reliable information was widely as possible. Their final call is not for an end to sex, but an end to "sex without responsibility."&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

However, the authors of ''How to Have Sex'' also faced significant barriers in disseminating their message, most of which was due to their message's lack of popularity within the majority of the LGBT community.&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; All of their applications for [[grants]] were rejected, and attempts to create a broader educational campaign built around the booklet's teachings were blocked by both the [[New York City government]] and organizations within the LGBT community.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=film&gt;Wein, Daryl.

Berkowitz recounts in an [[interview]] it being "infuriating" that in 1985, the city still hadn't adopted any standard safe sex education.&lt;ref name=film /&gt;

The advent of safe sex in urban gay male populations came too late for many people: by 1983, more than 1,476 people had died from AIDS and David France estimated that as much as half of all MSM in New York City and San Francisco had been infected.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;''The AIDS Epidemic: 1981-1987.'' [[The New York Times]], 1999. https://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/science/aids/timeline80-87.html. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=france /&gt; Retrospective analysis by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] found that there were between 250,000-300,000 people living with HIV in the United States in 1983, and the number of people newly infected between `83-`84 was around 150,000).&lt;ref name=cdc /&gt; However, the model set forth by Callen and Berkowitz at least provided the possibility of a "return to intimacy" for people with AIDS, which, despite being based on a now-defunct notion of how the syndrome arose, was important in combating the [[social death]] that many PWA faced after [[diagnosis]].&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;&lt;ref name=france /&gt; 
 
''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was also credited with laying a foundation for safe sex education outside of the LGBT community. Duke Global Health Institute founder Michael Merson describes lessons from this grassroots movement—e.g. the importance of [[contraceptives]] over abstinence—as being key in "a generation of prevention approaches to follow," including [[PEPFAR]] (which was criticized for its emphasis on abstinence) and [[The Global Fund]].&lt;ref name="merson"/&gt; 
   
In 1983, it was generally accepted knowledge that AIDS was at least indirectly sexually transmitted. However, it was the stigma and lack of education around this fact that made the frankness and sex-positivity ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' all the more important. The fact that the authors did not advocate for abstinence, were open to people's differing personal preferences, and emphasized that gay sex, anal-receptive sex in particular, was not dangerous or [[immoral]] in and of itself, made it much more effective and well-received by the gay community.&lt;ref name=france /&gt; According to [[Jeffrey Escoffier]], given that many members of the LGBT community saw gay sex as transgressive and [[Empowerment|empowering]], safe sex, particularly the use of condoms that had been traditionally seen as only necessary for [[heterosexual]] sex, was therefore a "normalization" of gay sex and a loss of [[Gay liberation|gay power]].&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; Thus, safe sex education that did not detract from the [[uniqueness]] and power in gay sex was vital; Sonnabend himself recognizes that "perhaps the most valuable contribution of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was its ability to propose condom use in a manner that was able to celebrate sex."&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;

==Inaccuracies==
In 1981, when Sonnabend was formulating the multifactorial theory of HIV/AIDS transmission, the available [[data]] did not clearly [[disprove]] either his [[Scientific model|model]] or the new agent [[theory]], and there was no time to wait for the debate to be cleared up before offering concrete prevention methods.&lt;ref name=multi /&gt; It was widely accepted that AIDS was sexually transmitted, and the fraught political environment made both models unappealing for different reasons.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; Sonnabend argued that "to propose without supporting evidence that any [[minority group|minority]] group might be carrying a potentially fatal new, [[mutant]] virus is unconscionable";&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; however, the multifactorial model also came under attack for being [[homophobic]] and [[moralistic]] in its approach to frequent and impersonal sex.&lt;ref&gt;''Armstrong, Elizabeth A.

Despite the fact that ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was based on incomplete knowledge of the causes of AIDS, the advice given in the 40 pages was relevant to HIV/AIDS prevention, at least when it comes to sex-related modes of transmission.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; Its central argument was to avoid getting semen and CMV in one's rectum, although, as the authors pointed out in the first section of the booklet, CMV could be substituted for the new, unidentified retrovirus that was hypothesized to cause AIDS.&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

However, there are several instances in which the advice is inaccurate and no longer a part of [[safe sex]] education. The authors put more emphasis than necessary on the [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] argument—that there are inherent [[behavioral]] patterns in the MSM [[community]] responsible for causing AIDS—and failed to recognize that a single exposure could result in infection.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; Under the multifactorial model, kissing a PWA, [[rimming]] and swallowing during oral sex all appear more risky than they actually are; on the other hand, having sex with a person with AIDS was more risky than the multifactorial theory suggested because a single contact can result in [[seroconversion]].&lt;ref name=ca /&gt; The multifactorial model was also unnecessarily critical of [[promiscuity]] (although the authors make sure to clarify that promiscuity is only problematic given high preexisting rates of STDs in the sexual network). In 2008, Sonnabend defended the pamphlet's focus on promiscuity, arguing that high quantities of unprotected sex were a "very significant health hazard" whether or not one put their faith in the multifactorial model, and, indeed, a high frequency of sexual encounters was still relevant given that it increased the probability of contact with an HIV+ person.&lt;ref name=trenches /&gt; 
 
The multifactorial model also gave the authors and their writing a certain degree of [[hope]] that the endpoint to AIDS was not necessarily [[death]] (which it seemed to be at the time): they believed that stopping exposure to semen and CMV after infection could improve the health of the infected individual.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=film /&gt; The [[asymptomatic]] latency period had not yet been defined, and accounts of people with AIDS, including Berkowitz himself, maintaining a relatively healthy [[standard of living]] post-[[diagnosis]] convinced the [[authors]] of the importance of continued use of protection among people with AIDS who have sex. As is now common knowledge, once one has been infected with HIV it is almost impossible to completely rid one's body of the virus.&lt;ref&gt;"HIV/AIDS." Planned Parenthood, 2017. https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/stds-hiv-safer-sex/hiv-aids. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the advice to continue using protection after being diagnosed was important in not only preventing future transmission to uninfected people but also to protecting the person with AIDS from being exposed to more pathogens through sex.

[[Historians]], as well as the authors themselves, recognize that the creation of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was only possible given their belief in the multifactorial model.&lt;ref name=france /&gt;&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;  Safe sex advocates would have been much less likely to propose condom use had they known that a single exposure was enough to contract HIV. For proponents of the single agent theory, "to suggest condom use would be tantamount to suggesting that one place a thin [[latex]] [[film]] between oneself and certain death," as Sonnabend put it.&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; Following the discovery of the HIV and the almost unanimous acceptance of the single agent theory in the scientific community, the authors have acknowledged the inaccuracies in their safe sex manual, while pointing out its continued importance.&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;

Berkowitz describes ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' as being more [[conservative]] than it needed to be, given that it operated on the sole [[principle]] that gay men should avoid getting sperm in their own or their partner's rectum without knowing the other's status.&lt;ref name=huff&gt;Adnum, Mark. "Saving Safe Sex: An Interview With Richard Berkowitz." HuffingtonPost, 6 February 2013. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He says, "at least we figured out very early that it was the recipient of anal sex that we needed to warn — and that we needed to celebrate."&lt;ref name=huff /&gt;

==Publication and Reception==

===Publication===
After the pamphlet went through numerous drafts and editions, Callen and Berkowitz had difficulty finding somewhere to publish it, given its controversial subject matter and point of view.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; It was rejected by the Gay Men's Health Crisis, a prominent LGBT community health group that promoted the single virus theory, as well as by the state of New York when they reached out for help with publication. The authors collected donations from the LGBT community in New York City to fund the printing, and received a significant donation from philanthropist and HIV/AIDS activist Randall Klose.&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; Callen even contributed his own tax refund to the cause.&lt;ref name=andriote&gt;Andriote, John-Manuel. ''Victory Deferred: How AIDS Changed Gay Life in America.'' University Of Chicago Press, first edition (June 1, 1999). {{ISBN|0226020495}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1983, they ordered 5,000 copies from Tower Press and distributed the copies around gay social establishments in the city, including bars, bookstores, clubs and other shops.&lt;ref name=france /&gt; The copyright is attributed to "News From the Front Publications," which was created by Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend founded in 1983 for the very purpose of printing and distributing their booklet.&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; This independent publication method reflects the grassroots, personal nature of the pamphlet: as Sonnabend wrote, "HTHS originated entirely in the community of people with and at risk for AIDS, from individuals with no organizational affiliation."&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;

===Reception===
====By the New York City LGBT community====
''How to Have Sex'' was met with a mixed response from its [[target audience]] ([[queer]] men/MSM) in New York City. Sales exceeded what the authors had expected, and within two weeks of the initial [[publication]] they had ordered a second batch, and, soon after, a third to meet popular [[demand]].&lt;ref name=france /&gt; David France describes himself and his [[friends]] being "absorbed" by the material: "the [[pool table]] sat idle as a [[dozen]] of us passed around copies, hungry for guidance through the [[terror]] that sex was causing."&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; It has been lauded as the "first sex-positive guide to practicing safe sex" and is widely regarded as revolutionizing the tone of safe sex education, particularly in the LGBT community.&lt;ref name=andriote /&gt; The only real sacrifices in behavior that it required were abstaining from substance use in sex-related situations, rather than abstinence from any form of sex itself. Most readers reacted well to the positive and casual tone of the writing, as well as the frank descriptions of sexual acts. [[Edmund White]], author of ''The Joys of Gay Sex'', said of the pamphlet: "this is the sanest, most sensible advice I've read yet about AIDS" and [[Dennis Altman]], author of ''The Homosexualization of America'' said, "at last: a response to the effect of aids on our lives that goes beyond fears and myths to suggest positive actions."&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berkowitz, Richard. "4. How to Have Sex in an Epidemic." ''Safe Sex Positive.'' Wordpress, 29 June 2010. https://richardberkowitz.com/category/4-how-to-have-sex-in-an-epidemic/&lt;/ref&gt; David France called it "a survival [[guide]] for the plague years."&lt;ref name=france /&gt; Many gay men were simply glad for any concrete advice in the midst of such confusion, particularly advice that did not present celibacy as the only safe option.

====Controversy====
As expected, ''How to Have Sex'' did receive significant [[criticism]] from other gay men and [[gay organizations]] for its critical take on promiscuity. Callen and Berkowitz had attempted to tone down their critical tone from their first major publication, "We Know Who We Are: Two Gay Men Declare War on Promiscuity" in a 1982 issue of the New York Native, which had harshly condemned the "excessiveness" and "pigging out" that was occurring in the gay nightclub scene.&lt;ref name=know /&gt; They incorporate consistent affirmation of gay sex throughout the forty pages, including sentences like the following:&lt;ref name=HHSE /&gt;

{{quote|As you read on, we hope we make at least one point clear: Sex doesn't make you sick — diseases do. Gay sex doesn't make you sick — gay men who are sick do.}}

Many gay community members and leaders saw the writing in ''How to Have Sex'' as moralistic and attributed the advice against some types of sex to internalized homophobia, [[self-hatred]] and an "anti-sexual sense of guilt."&lt;ref name=ACTUP /&gt; A response written by Michael Lynch and Bill Lewis in the Toronto Politic, a Canadian gay newspaper, criticized Callen and Berkowitz for blowing the epidemic out of proportion and allowing the medical community to "pathologize" gay men, and the authors faced frequent accusations of [[victim-blaming]] and siding with the religious right.&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt;&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt; It was not an easy message for some gay men to receive: in an interview for Berkowitz' biographical film, Sex Positive, Larry Kramer described it as a blast of "cold [[water]] in the [[face]]."&lt;ref name=film /&gt;

However, all three authors firmly believed in the importance of disseminating their message despite negative reactions. Callen wrote in his book ''Surviving AIDS'' that "to be attacked for trying to save the lives of others was deeply wounding. But we felt we had no choice."&lt;ref&gt;Callen, Michael. ''Surviving AIDS.'' HarperCollins, first edition (November 1, 1990). {{ISBN|0060161485}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Sonnabend argued that [[political correctness]] and the "desire to be nonjudgemental" were beginning to interfere with [[medical practitioners]]' primary commitment to take care of their patients and was becoming a public health issue.&lt;ref&gt;Sonnabend, Joseph. "Promiscuity is bad for your health." ''The New York Native,'' September 13–26, 1982. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Callen even applauded the negative responses to their advocacy published in [[the New York Native]], because it ended up causing debate and dramatically widening the [[audience]] and popularity of ''How to Have Sex'' in an Epidemic. "It turns out historically to have been one of the advantages of our status as [[heretics]]," he was quoted saying in ''[[How to Survive a Plague]].''&lt;ref name=france /&gt;

Callen and Berkowitz do address the personal and [[political]] implications of their safe sex advice, specifically the loss of [[autonomy]] and [[joy]] the community might experience from having to [[police]] sexual behavior. In "We Know Who We Are" they wrote:&lt;ref name=know /&gt;

{{quote|ultimately, it may be more important to let people die in pursuit of their own [[happiness]] than to limit personal [[freedom]] by regulating risk.}}

====By the straight community====
In his memoir, Berkowitz wrote, "there was little chance we would water down our safe sex [[manifesto]] to make it more presentable for the general public in the [[Reagan era]]."&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;  Although he and Callen both stressed that ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was not intended for [[Heterosexuality|straight]] audiences, its popularity and importance as a foundational safe sex manifesto ensured that it got at least some level of attention beyond the LGBT community of New York City. According to the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] archives, the pamphlet was purchased by numerous [[public libraries]] (twelve known examples) and [[universities]], as well as seven known [[high schools]], a surprising number of which were in traditionally conservative states that still had functioning [[sodomy laws]].&lt;ref name=blah&gt;Oliver, Chris. "Who was reading 'How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'?" London school of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Archives, 12 December 2014. http://blogs.lshtm.ac.uk/library/2014/12/12/reading-sex-epidemic/. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The frank description of gay sex did not seem to dissuade more mainstream [[institutions]], although it is unclear whether they were aware of the [[Sexually explicit|explicit]] content of the manual before purchasing it.

The primary readership of ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' was still gay men in New York City, but knowledge of the work spread to people of all sexualities around the country, and even, in some cases, [[internationally]]. Soon after its initial publication, the booklet was given a review in the [[New York Review of Books]], and later a [[newscaster]] came from [[West Germany]] to interview the authors about their work.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberson, Jonathan. "Anatomy of an Epidemic." The New York Review of Books, 18 August 1983. http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1983/08/18/anatomy-of-an-epidemic/. Retrieved 14 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=france /&gt; Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend also received response letters from around the [[country]] and from international readers.&lt;ref name=blah /&gt;

==Historical significance==
Social scientists have credited ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' and a 1982 pamphlet called ''Play Fair!'' by the [[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]] as the first literature to recommend safe sex as a strategy for reducing the risk of contracting the transmitting agent which causes AIDS.&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petro, Anthony M.''After the Wrath of God: AIDS, Sexuality, and American Religion.'' Oxford University Press; first edition (July 1, 2015). {{ISBN|0199391289}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar AIDS education manual, entitled "Can We Talk?" was published by the [[Harvey Milk LGBT Democratic Club]] in San Francisco at the beginning of 1983, although it is less often credited as being foundational for safe sex.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"AIDS Prevention Flyers: Can We Talk?", Pacific Oregon University Archives. http://exhibits.lib.pacificu.edu/items/show/940. Retrieved 13 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===For HIV/AIDS Activism and Gay Politics===
Despite the negative press that ''How to Have Sex'' received for what many perceived as a criticism of promiscuity, many [[Queer theory|queer theorists]] have acknowledged the importance of the pamphlet and others like it to the evolution of the broader [[LGBT rights movement]].&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt;&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;&lt;ref name=ACTUP /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dowsett, Gary W. ''Practicing Desire: Homosexual Sex in the Era of AIDS.'' [[Stanford University Press]], first edition (November 1, 1996). {{ISBN|0804727112}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The politics at the time were fraught, and the AIDS epidemic revealed what Callen and Berkowitz described as the danger of having "a positive political force [i.e. the LGBT liberation] tied to a dangerous lifestyle [i.e. promiscuity without condom use]."&lt;ref name=know /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/799651 |jstor=799651 |title=Gay Baths and the Social Organization of Impersonal Sex |journal=Social Problems |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=124 |year=1975 |last1=Weinberg |first1=Martin S |last2=Williams |first2=Colin J }}&lt;/ref&gt; The viewpoint presented in the booklet is one that attempted to challenge the institutions that had arisen in the urban gay male community, including bathhouses and backrooms, that had an [[economic]] "stake in keeping us promiscuous," according to the authors.&lt;ref name=know /&gt; There was a common notion in the community at the time that STDs were supposed to be what [[Edmund White]] called "[[red]] [[badges]] of [[courage]] in a [[war]] against a sex negative society," but as the cost of life from these diseases rose, members of that same community saw the need to change practices to make sex safer, and ''How to Have Sex'' is a result of that phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Tammy. ''The Death of Right and Wrong.'' Crown Forum, Reprint edition (June 22, 2004). {{ISBN|1400052947}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/136345930100500103 |title=Gay Men and HIV/AIDS Risk Management |journal=Health: an Interdisciplinary Journal for the Social Study of Health, Illness and Medicine |volume=5 |pages=50 |year=2016 |last1=Flowers |first1=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is part of the shift in behavior and mentality from the 70s to the 80s resulting directly from the AIDS epidemic.&lt;ref name=law /&gt;&lt;ref name=ncbistudy /&gt; The following quote from "We Know Who We Are" demonstrates the authors' call to action:&lt;ref name=know /&gt;
{{quote|The [[motto]] of promiscuous gay men has been 'so many men, so little time.' In the `70s we worried about so many men; in the `80s we will have to worry about so little time. For us, the party that was the `70s is over. For some, perhaps, homosexuality may always mean promiscuity. They may very well die for that belief. The last 13 years since [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]] have demonstrated tremendous change. So must the next 13 years.}}

===For the People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement===
{{main|People with AIDS}}
Along with buddy programs, [[The Denver Principles]], the San Francisco model of care, and [[activism]] occurring around the country, pamphlets like ''How to have Sex'' and ''Play Fair!'' have been described as key elements of the [[People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement]].&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2013.301381 |pmid=23948013 |pmc=3780739 |title=Only Your Calamity: The Beginnings of Activism by and for People with AIDS |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=103 |issue=10 |pages=1788–98 |year=2013 |last1=Wright |first1=Joe }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HTG /&gt; Sonnabend called the method presented in the manual a "do it yourself" approach that "did not wait for others to take care of pressing needs."&lt;ref name=sonnabendblog /&gt; As Berkowitz explained, having the power to control one's [[sex life]] and to prevent oneself from getting sick was the essence of [[self-empowerment]] at a time when AIDS was taking away gay men's [[sexual freedom]] and ability to enact a [[rebellion]] against heteronormativity through sex.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;

===For Safe Sex===
{{main|Sex positive movement}}
Along with Play Fair!, ''How to have Sex'' was among the first safe sex educational materials produced and widely disseminated that addressed the subject in a positive and affirming light.&lt;ref&gt;King, Edward. ''Safety in Numbers: Safer Sex and Gay Men.'' Routledge, first edition (April 27, 1994). {{ISBN|0415909317}}. Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; David France described the authors' method and aims to modify the behaviors of an entire [[subculture]] as something so radical that, had they discussed its feasibility with [[social scientists]] beforehand, they might have been dissuaded from attempting it.&lt;ref name=france /&gt; That said, Berkowitz has lamented that the grassroots origins of safe sex were rapidly forgotten as it became increasingly touted as an invention from experts in the scientific community.&lt;ref name=memoir /&gt;

===For Public Health===
''How to Have Sex'' in an Epidemic is evidence of a larger trend occurring in the 1980s and 1990s in which the impetus for [[Therapy|treatment]] and [[preventive healthcare|prevention]] for HIV/AIDS came directly from the [[People With AIDS|infected communities]].&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;&lt;ref name=law /&gt; As Alan Brandt argues, the AIDS epidemic did more than any other to blur the line between the healthcare field and the people they treated; community-based care became a central model for public and global health efforts related to this particular disease.&lt;ref name=brandt&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMp1305297 |pmid=23738542 |title=How AIDS Invented Global Health |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=368 |issue=23 |pages=2149–52 |year=2013 |last1=Brandt |first1=Allan M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social scientists have recognized the importance of "[[vernacular]] knowledge" from within the gay community, such as the vocabulary used in ''How to Have Sex in an Epidemic'' being brought into a broader [[epidemiological]]/scientific context, because it was this intimate knowledge of sexual behavior among MSM that gave Callen and Berkowitz the authority to address the subject and the ability to do so in a way that appealed to their audience and avoided condescension.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt; Queer theorist [[Douglas Crimp]] wrote:&lt;ref name=prom /&gt; 

{{quote|We [gay men] were able to invent safe sex because we have always known that sex is not, in an [[epidemic]] or not, limited to [[penetrative sex]]. Our promiscuity taught us many things, not only about the [[pleasures]] of sex, but about the great multiplicity of those pleasures.}}

On a practical level, this sort of grassroots prevention advocacy was necessary because, in the early years of the epidemic when little was known about transmission and AIDS [[panic]] was highly prevalent, many [[mainstream]] medical [[institutions]] refused to offer care to [[people with AIDS]] or did so in a substandard manner.&lt;ref&gt;"When Doctors Refuse to Treat AIDS."

Retrieved 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the booklet itself and the partnership of the contributors (i.e., between Callen, Berkowitz and Sonnabend) helped lay the foundation for greater [[collaboration]] between [[scientists]] and the affected communities they study.&lt;ref name=brandt /&gt;&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;

''How to have Sex in an Epidemic'' was an important medical text in that it gave straight [[healthcare professionals]] and mainstream institutions more in depth knowledge of gay culture in general, and sexual culture of MSM specifically, including a variety of niche sex acts. This information was critical for [[Medical practitioner|practitioner]]s and [[researchers]] in their attempts to understand the risks associated with contracting HIV.&lt;ref name=escoffier /&gt;

'''Hungarian Templeton Program''' is a unique pilot program taking place between 15/09/2015 and 28/02/2017. The main purpose of the program is to develop and support exceptional Hungarian cognitive talents in the 10-29 age group.

==John Templeton Foundation==
[[Sir John Templeton]] (1912-2008) was strongly committed to supporting research in science, theology, philosophy and the social sciences. One of the main goals of his endeavors was to contribute to understanding the fundamental underlying principles of the universe and to building a better society on the ethical, intellectual and spiritual levels. 
He founded the [[John Templeton Foundation]] in 1987, which also includes the [[Templeton World Charity Foundation]]. The TWCF chooses which initiatives it funds and does not accept unsolicited proposals. In accordance with the testamentary provisions of [[Sir John Templeton]] , it supports worthy programs which seek answers to the "big questions" and challenges of life and the universe. As well, it provides assistance to persons with exceptional cognitive talent who contribute to the flourishing of humanity.

==Hungarian Templeton Program==
This program is implemented with the funding and the support of the [[Templeton World Charity Foundation]] and of the [[European Social Fund]] as co-sponsor. The program's advisory partner is the Association of Hungarian Talent Support Organizations ([[:hu:Magyar Tehetségsegítő Szervezetek Szövetsége|Magyar Tehetségsegítő Szervezetek Szövetsége]] - MATEHETSZ).
Launched on September 15, 2015 and lasting until February 28, 2017, the Hungarian Templeton Program is a unique pilot program whose main objective is to develop and support exceptional Hungarian cognitive talents in the 10-29 age group. Using a new methodology specifically designed for this purpose, program staff will identify 300 Hungarian youth with exceptional cognitive talents (Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows) as well as 150 disadvantaged children aged 5–8 with exceptional cognitive talents.

The aim of the program is to bring together a creative community and network of exceptionally talented people whose members will, with the assistance of top-performing contemporary personalities, prepare themselves to take on the momentous task of becoming the leaders, thinkers and entrepreneurs of Hungary and Europe in the decades ahead.

A customized one-year talent support program will be developed for each of the selected talented youth (the Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows). The program also devotes special attention to underprivileged children aged 5–8. It uses a unique talent testing procedure created for this age group, as well as a talent development program consisting of workshop sessions over a period of several days.

The program also offers assistance to talented youth identified during the selection process but not chosen as Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows by offering them access to the ESF "Talents for Hungary" enrichment programs also supported by the Association of Hungarian Talent Support Organizations (MATEHETSZ).

==Selection process==
The 300 Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows are to be selected using objective scientific criteria and a new methodology. Selection will involve tests measuring aptitudes in a number of areas.

===For talented youth aged 10-19===
IQ test, vocabulary, problem solving, working memory, motivation and creativity.

===For talented youth aged 20-29===
IQ test, evaluation of achievements and productivity based on a motivation letter, activities thus far, level of interest and an introductory presentation or video.

==Program framework==
Cognitive talents selected for the program – the Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows – will each benefit from a one-year customized talent support package. Each young person will receive one-on-one mentoring from prominent Hungarian scientists and entrepreneurs who make up the program's roster of mentors. 
Elements of the support program include '''[[e-learning]]; [[coaching]]; [[personality development]]; [[Business networking|networking]]; development of communication, [[linguistic]], computer, [[research]], [[innovation]], financial and entrepreneurial skills; assistance in choosing a career path in a context of [[social responsibility]].'''
 
In addition to supporting skill development in specific areas, the program places especial emphasis on encouraging Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellows to use their aptitudes and knowledge responsibly for the '''good of society'''.

==Program content==
Based on their individual needs and the options available in the program, Junior Fellows will receive a personalized talent support package which may include:

* Participation in scientific research and development projects 
* Familiarization with research centers, cases and practices in both scientific and business contexts
* Scholarships
* International travel (competitions, camps, conferences)
* Business trainings (e.g. Lean, Start-up)
* [[LinkedIn]], Everyday Heroes and PREZI trainings
* Public speaking and presentation-making trainings
* Language learning opportunities 
* Familiarization with case studies in a business context
* Soft skill trainings 
* Activities to develop social responsibility
* Drafting business plans, support for start-ups 
* Support for social entrepreneurs (Ashoka) 
* Participation in national and international talent day events 
* Innovation camp

==Post-program opportunities==
This pilot program is for one year, and is expected to continue in [[Hungary]] and serve as a model for expansion into other countries in versions adapted to regional cultural differences. Talented youth selected for the program will be monitored and assisted for a few years after the end of the program by the ongoing network of contacts in the Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellow Network.

==Mentoring==
Substantive support for the Program is provided by our network of mentors: scientists, researchers, experts and businesspeople who have shown exceptional levels of achievement in their fields and careers. Mentoring is a crucial element of the program and a mentor will be assigned to every Hungarian Junior Templeton Fellow.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "eavesdropping" is often disadvantageous to the producer (though other benefits of producing the substance may outweigh this cost, hence its persistence over evolutionary time). The kairomone improves the [[biological fitness|fitness]] of the recipient and in this respect differs from an [[allomone]] (which is the opposite: it benefits the producer and harms the receiver) and a synomone (which benefits both parties). The term is mostly used in the field of [[entomology]] (the study of insects). Two main ecological cues are provided by kairomones; they generally either indicate a food source for the receiver, or the presence of a [[predator]], the latter of which is less common or at least less studied.&lt;ref name="ELS"/&gt;

==Predators use them to find prey==
An example of this can be found in the [[Ponderosa Pine]] tree (''Pinus ponderosa''), which produces a [[terpene]] called [[myrcene]] when it is damaged by the Western pine beetle. Instead of deterring the insect, it acts [[synergistically]] with [[Pheromone#Aggregation|aggregation pheromone]]s which in turn act to lure more beetles to the tree. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Specialist predatory beetles find [[bark beetle]]s (their prey) using the pheromones the bark beetles produce. In this case the chemical substance produced is both a pheromone (communication between bark beetles) and a kairomone (eavesdropping). This was discovered accidentally when the predatory beetles and other enemies were attracted to insect traps baited with bark beetle pheromones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Pheromones and Animal Behaviour|last= Wyatt|first= Tristram D. |year= 2003|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge |isbn= 0-521-48526-6|pages= 2, 230–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pheromones of different kinds may be exploited as kairomones by receivers. The German wasp, ''[[Vespula germanica]]'', is attracted to a pheromone produced by male Mediterranean fruit flies (''[[Ceratitis capitata]]'') when the males gather for a [[mating]] display, causing the death of some. In contrast, it is the [[alarm pheromone]] (used to communicate the presence of a threat) of an ant (''[[Iridomyrmex purpureus]]'') that a [[spider]] predator is attracted to.&lt;ref name="ELS"/&gt;

==Prey use them to adjust to predators==
Some prey make use of chemicals originating from predators, using these cues as an indicator of the level of predation risk and changing their [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] if need be. Changes in morphology caused by predator presence is known as [[predator-induced polyphenism]], and occurs across a variety of animals. For example, ''[[Daphnia]] cucullata'' show formation of "helmets" when exposed to predators or the water they have lived in. Their predators include cladocerans (such as ''[[Leptodora]] kindtii'') and [[larva]]e of ''[[Chaoborus flavicans]]'', a [[midge]]. They respond to these kairomones by doubling the size of their helmets, a protective structure. These changes in morphology make them safer from predators.&lt;ref name="ELS2"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia

[[Mice]] are instinctively afraid of the smell of their natural [[predator]]s, including cats and rats.

==Applications==
Like pheromones (communication chemicals used within a species), kairomones can be utilized as an 'attracticide' to lure a pest species to a location containing [[pesticide]]. However, they might also be used to lure desired species. Kairomones produced by the hosts of parasitic wasps have been used in an attempt to attract them and keep them around in crops where they reduce herbivory, but this could instead result in fewer attacks on the herbivous pest if the applied kairomone distracts them from finding real hosts.&lt;ref name="ELS"/&gt; For example, studies have shown that kairomones are effective in attracting female [[Eldana|African sugarcane borers]] to deposit eggs on dead leaf material.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, G.W. (June 1990). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fe1b/fc9a16919a91f075b0f77c95e9253a05ca1d.pdf "THE INFLUENCE OF DEAD LEAF MATERIAL ON THE OVIPOSITION BEHAVIOUR OF ELDANA SACCHARINA (LEPIDOPTERA: PYRALIDAE) IN SUGARCANE"] (PDF). ''The South African Sugar Technologists' Association''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent discoveries have highlighted that predators are attracted to the odour of co-existing predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garvey|first1=Patrick M.|title=Dominant predator odour triggers caution and eavesdropping behaviour in a mammalian mesopredator|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=2016|volume=70|issue=4|pages=481–492|doi=10.1007/s00265-016-2063-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language assessment''' or '''language testing''' is a field of study under the umbrella of [[applied linguistics]].  Its main focus is the assessment of [[first language|first]], [[second language|second]] or other language in the school, college, or university context; assessment of language use in the workplace; and assessment of language in the immigration, citizenship, and [[right of asylum|asylum]] contexts.&lt;ref name="HornbergerSpringer"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hornberger, Nancy H. |author2=Shohamy, Elana   |title=Encyclopedia of Language and Education, Volume 7: Language Testing and Assessment |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-387-32875-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment may include listening, speaking, reading, [[Writing Assessment|writing]], an integration of two or more of these skills, or other constructs of language ability. Equal weight may be placed on knowledge (understanding how the language works theoretically) and [[language proficiency|proficiency]] (ability to use the language practically), or greater weight may be given to one aspect or the other.&lt;ref&gt;http://hrd.apec.org/index.php/Language_Assessment {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722201227/http://hrd.apec.org/index.php/Language_Assessment |date=22 July 2009 }} APEC Human Resources Development Working Group&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{globalize|date=August 2008}}
The earliest works in language assessment in the United States date back to the 1950s to the pioneering studies and test created by [[Robert Lado]] and David Harris. The earliest large scale assessments in the United States were referred to as the Michigan Tests, developed by the English Language Institute at the University of Michigan, now known as [[CaMLA]], and the [[TOEFL|''Test of English as a Foreign Language'' (TOEFL)]]  developed by [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS), Princeton, New Jersey.

The English Language Institute  at the University of Michigan ([[CaMLA]]) was established in 1941 and was the first of its kind in the United States. Charles Fries, Director of ELI, and [[Robert Lado]], Director of Testing at ELI, were determined to put foreign language teaching and testing on a "scientific" footing. The first test launched in 1946 was the ''Lado Test of Aural Comprehension''. Approximately 10 years later, a full suite of tests had been assembled: "an English language test battery", which was administered to incoming foreign students at Michigan and other universities. Today this is known at the Michigan English Language Assessment Battery ([[MELAB]]). In 1953, the ELI also developed the ECPE (Examination for the Certificate of Proficiency in English) exam, under contract to the United States Information Agency, for use abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Swales, J. 2013, Other Floors, Other Voices: A Textography of A Small University Building, https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xsz5AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT68&amp;lpg=PT68&amp;dq=1953+ECPE+melab+1985&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BiM65G_a-8&amp;sig=xoxFrmJibs4ScLuNpc8Z3ftocX4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lbKBVaGQK6iR7Aa2r4PoCA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=1953%20ECPE%20melab%201985&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

TOEFL was launched in 1961 and was designed to assess the English language ability of students applying for admission to U.S. and Canadian colleges and universities.  This test, which is used widely around the world, is still in use although it is now only available in the internet-based format (now called the TOEFL iBT&lt;ref&gt;About the TOEFL iBT Test http://www.ets.org/toefl/ibt/about/ Retrieved 23 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;).

Many tests from other companies, universities and agencies compete for this market: [[International Test of English Proficiency|iTEP]] (International Test of English Proficiency), the [[Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program]] (CELPIP) Test, the [[Pearson Language Tests|Pearson Language Test]]'s ''[[Pearson Test of English Academic|Pearson Test of English]]'' (PTE), [[CaMLA]] assessments including the ''Michigan English Language Assessment Battery'' ([[MELAB]]) and [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]], [[the British Council]] and the Australian IDP's ''[[International English Language Testing System]]'' (IELTS). In the United States, non-profit and other organizations such as the [[Center for Applied Linguistics]], Washington, D.C. and [[Language Testing International]], White Plains, NY have developed language tests that are used by many public and private agencies.  Many universities too, like the [[UCLA|University of California, Los Angeles]], [[Teachers College|Teachers College, Columbia University]], and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign]], have developed English (and other) language tests to assess the abilities of their students and teaching assistants. These language assessments are generally known as proficiency or achievement assessments. Other modern English language tests developed include ''The General English Proficiency Test (GEPT)'' in Taiwan, the ''College English Test'' in China, and the ''STEP Eiken'' in Japan. New technology has also made a presence in the field: Versant's English and Dutch assessments use phone technology to record the speaking and automated scoring of their speaking tests, and the ETS is currently experimenting with automated scoring of their [[Writing Assessment|writing tests]].

== Organizations ==
The International Language Testing Association (ILTA) is one of the many organizations that organizes conferences, workshops, and a public forum for the discussion of important matters. ILTA's major annual conference is the Language Testing Research Colloquium.  ILTA's Lifetime Achievement Award winners include: [[Carol Chapelle]] (USA), Alan Davies (UK), Lyle Bachman (USA), Bernard Spolsky (Israel), John Clark (USA), Charles Alderson (UK) and Elana Shohamy (Israel).

Educational Testing Service, Princeton, New Jersey, the home of the TOEFL, offers an annual outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award in Second or Foreign Language and the [[University of Cambridge]], UK, also offers an annual outstanding master's degree Award in second language testing. In Europe, there are two organizations: the Association of Language Testers of Europe (ALTE) and the European Association for Language Testing and Assessment (EALTA). All of these associations have developed [[code of ethics|Codes of Ethics]] and Practice that all language assessment professionals are expected to adhere to.

== Annual conferences ==
There are many annual conferences on general or specific topics. Among the most important conferences is ILTA's official conference: the '''Language Testing Research Colloquium''' (LTRC), which has been held every year since 1978. In the last few years, it has been held in different parts of the world: Temecula, California, USA (2004); Ottawa, Canada (2005); Melbourne, Australia (2006); Barcelona, Spain (2007); Hangzhou, China (2008), and Denver, Colorado (2009), Cambridge, UK (2010), Ann Arbor, Michigan (2011), Princeton, New Jersey (2012), and Seoul, South Korea (2013).

ALTE's international conferences are held in different cities in Europe: Barcelona, Spain (2002); Berlin, Germany (2005); Cambridge, UK (2008); Krakow, Poland (2011); Paris,France (2014); Bologna, Italy (2017) ) with regional conferences in Perugia, Prague, Budapest, Sofia, and Lisbon. Similarly, there are regional meetings in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. International conference themes have included supporting the European Year of Languages (2001), the impact of multilingualism (2005), the wider social and educational impact of assessment (2008) and the role of language frameworks (2011). Selected conference papers have been published through the [[Studies in Language Testing (SiLT)]] volumes.

== Publications ==
There are two premier journals in the field: ''Language Assessment Quarterly'' (published by [[Routledge]]/[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]) currently edited by James E. Purpura and ''[[Language Testing]]'' (published by [[Sage Publications]]) currently edited by Glenn Fulcher and April Ginther that publishes major findings from researchers. Both these journals are indexed in Thompson's SSCI list. SpringerNature publishes ''Language Testing in Asia'', which is focussed on Asia, the Middle East and Oceania. Other journals that publish articles from the field include ''[[Applied Linguistics (journal)|Applied Linguistics]]'', ''Language Learning'', ''[[TESOL Quarterly]]'', ''Assessing Writing'', and ''[[System (journal)|System]]''. Some of these journals have special issue volumes on Ethics in language assessment, structural equation modeling, language assessment in Asia, Classroom assessment, etc. and commentaries, brief reports, and book and test reviews.

The field has exploded in the last twenty years in terms of textbooks and research publications. The most popular books include: Lyle Bachman's ''Fundamental considerations in language testing,'' and ''Statistical Analyses for Language Assessment,'' Lyle Bachman and Adrian Palmer's ''Language Testing in Practice'' and ''Language Assessment in Practice,' Glenn Fulcher and Fred Davidson's 'Language Testing and Assessment: An Advanced Resource Book', Charles Alderson's 'Assessing Reading,'' John Read's ''Assessing Vocabulary,'' James Purpura's ''Assessing Grammar,'' Gary Buck's ''Assessing Listening,'' Sara Weigle's ''[[Assessing Writing]],' Glenn Fulcher's 'Practical Language Testing' and 'Testing Second Language Speaking'. Edited volumes include: [[Alister Cumming]]'s ''Validation in Language Testing,'' Antony John Kunnan's ''Validation in Language Assessment,'' and ''Fairness in Language Assessment,'' and the 'Routledge Handbook of Language Testing', edited by Glenn Fulcher and Fred Davidson.

The most popular book series are Michael Milanovic, Cyril Weir, and Lynda Taylor's [[Studies in Language Testing (SiLT)]] series, and Lyle Bachman and Charles Alderson's ''Cambridge Language Assessment Series.''

== Courses ==
Language assessment or language testing courses are taught as required or elective courses in many graduate and [[doctoral]] programs, particularly in the subjects of [[applied linguistics]], [[English for Speakers of Other Languages]], [[English as a second language|English as a second or foreign language]], or educational linguistics. These programs are known as MA or PhD programs in Applied Linguistics, Educational Linguistics, [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|TESOL]], [[TEFL]], or [[TESL]]. The focus of most courses is on test development, [[psychometric]] qualities of tests, [[Validity (logic)|validity]], [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and fairness of tests, and [[classical true score measurement theory]].  Additional courses focus on [[item response theory]], [[factor analysis]], [[structural equation modeling]], [[G factor (psychometrics)|G theory]], [[latent growth modeling]],  [[Qualitative research|qualitative analysis]] of test performance data such as conversation and [[discourse analysis]], and politics and language policy issues.

Universities that have regular courses and programs that focus on language assessment at the Ph.D. level include University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, University of Hawai'i, Manoa, Teachers College, Columbia University, Penn State University, Georgia State University, Northern Arizona University, McGill University, University of Toronto, Lancaster University (UK), University of Leicester, University of Bristol, University of Cambridge, University of Bedfordshire, and Guangdong University of Foreign Studies (China); at the MA level include Lancaster University, University of Leicester, California State Universities at Fullerton, Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Jose, and San Francisco.

'''[[Image:Lavafilter.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A constantly submerged lavafilter]]
A '''lava filter''' is a biological filter that uses lavastone pebbles as support material on which [[microorganism]]s can grow in a thin biofilm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stowa-selectedtechnologies.nl/Sheets/Sheets/Lava.Filters.html Overview of lavafilters]&lt;/ref&gt; This community of microorganisms, known as the [[periphyton]] break down the odor components in the air, such as [[hydrogen sulfide]]. The biodegradation processes that occurs is provided by the bacteria themselves. In order for this to work, sufficient oxygen as well as water and nutrients (for cell growth) is to be supplied.

==Method==
Contaminated air enters the system at the bottom of the filter and passes in an upward direction through the filter. Water is supplied through the surface of the biofilter and trickles down over the lava rock to the bottom, where it is collected. Constant water provisioning at the surface prevents dry-out of the active bacteria in the biofilm and ensures a constant pH value in the filter. It also functions to make nutrients available to the bacteria.

[[Image:Lavastones.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A pile of lavastones in a lavafilter]]
Percolating water collected at the filter bottom contains odour components as well as sulfuric acid from the biological oxidation of hydrogen sulfide. Depending on the process design the collected water is recirculated or subjected to further treatment.

==Types of systems==
At present: 2 types of systems are used;
# constantly [[Underwater|submerged]] lava filters (for [[Waste stabilization pond|treatment pond]]s, combined [[Waste stabilization pond|treatment pond]]s/[[irrigation]] [[reservoir]]s, ...)
# not-submerged lava filters (for wastewater treatment; wastewater is simply sprayed on the pebbles with this system)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oost-vlaanderen.be/docs/nl/gc/35447.%20afvalwaterzuivering%20op%20landbouwbedrijven.pdf Pictures and small overview of non-constant submerged lavafilters (in Dutch)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constantly submerged lavafilters===

These are constructed out of 2 layers of lava pebbles and a top layer of nutrient-free soil (only at the plants roots).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holon.se/folke/projects/vatpark/concept.shtml Example picture of constant-submerged lavastone filter]&lt;/ref&gt; On top, [[Helophyte|water-purifying plants]] (as ''[[Iris pseudacorus]]'' and ''[[Sparganium|Sparganium erectum]])'' are placed. Usually, around 1/4 of the dimension of lavastone is required to purify the water and just like slow sand filters, a series of herringbone drains are placed (with lava filters these are placed at the bottom layer).

The water-purifying plants used with constantly submerged, planted, lavafilters (e.g. treatment ponds, self-purifying irrigation reservoirs, ...) include a wide variety of plants, depending on the local [[climate]] and geoographical location. Plants are usually chosen which are [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] in that location for environmental reasons and optimum workings of the system. In addition to water-purifying (de-nutrifying) plants, plants that supply [[oxygen]], and [[shade (shadow)|shade]] are also added in [[ecologic]] water [[drainage basin|catchments]], [[ponds]], ... This to allow a complete [[ecosystem]] to form. Finally, in addition to plants, locally grown [[bacteria]] and non-[[predator]]y fish are also added to eliminate pests. The bacteria are usually grown locally by submerging [[straw]] in water and allowing it to form bacteria (arriving from the surrounding [[atmosphere]]). The plants used (placed on an area 1/4 of the water mass) are divided in 4 separate water depth-zones; knowingly:

# A water-depth zone from 0–20&amp;nbsp;cm; [[Iris pseudacorus]], ''[[Sparganium|Sparganium erectum]]'', ... may be placed here (temperate climates)
# A water-depth zone from 40–60&amp;nbsp;cm; ''[[Stratiotes|Stratiotes aloides]]'', ''[[Hydrocharis|Hydrocharis morsus-ranae]]'', ... may be placed here (temperate climates)
# A water-depth zone from 60–120&amp;nbsp;cm; [[Nymphaea|Nymphea alba]], ... may be placed here (temperate climates)
# A submerged water-depth zone; [[Myriophyllum|Myriophyllum spicatum]], ... may be placed here (temperate climates)

Finally, three types of (non-predatory) fish (surface; bottom and ground-swimmers) are chosen. This of course to ensure that the fish may 'get along'. Examples of the three types of fish (for temperate climates) are:
* Surface swimming fish: ''[[Leuciscus leuciscus]]'', ''[[Leuciscus idus]]'', ''[[Scardinius erythrophthalmus]]''
* Middle-swimmers: ''[[Rutilus rutilus]]''
* Bottom-swimming fish: ''[[Tinca tinca]]''

Mandated by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) standard 24 CFR Part 1330 (a) (4),  '''Lead-Safe Work Practices''' provide those performing remodeling tasks in homes built before 1978 with guidelines on procedures they should be using to prevent creating a [[lead]] hazard.

[[Lead poisoning]] remains a major environmental health concern, and while we most often associate the disease with childhood, high levels of lead exposure are linked to serious adult health conditions, such as high blood pressure and dementia.

Workers who remodel or renovate older homes where the likelihood of [[lead paint]] is high are particularly vulnerable to lead exposure. Their work creates contaminated dust which they then inhale. They can also put their families at risk by bringing contaminated dust home on their work clothes.

The [[National Safety Council]] emphasizes that everyone should be aware of the potential presence of lead paint in homes built prior to 1978, and notes that…”such awareness is particularly important for those engaged in the building trades, as well as [[DIY|do-it-yourselfers]], to learn how to perform their work in a lead-safe manner.”

Effective April 22, 2010, under its Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) Rule, the EPA mandates that firms performing renovation, repair, and painting projects that disturb lead-based paint in pre-1978 homes, child care facilities, and schools be certified by the EPA and that they use certified renovators who are trained by EPA-approved training providers to follow lead-safe work practices. Individuals can become certified renovators by taking an approved training course.

Anyone performing RRP projects in pre-1978 homes and child-occupied facilities, must learn how to use lead-safe work practices and follow these three simple procedures:

*Contain the work area.
*Minimize dust.
*Clean up thoroughly.

'''Mach tuck''' is an [[aerodynamic]] effect whereby the nose of an [[aircraft]] tends to [[Pitch (flight)|pitch]] downward as the airflow around the wing reaches [[supersonic]] speeds; the aircraft will first experience this effect at significantly below [[Mach number|Mach]] 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Transonic flow patterns.svg|thumb|right|Shock wave above wing moves rearwards as aircraft speed approaches Mach 1]]

==Causes==
Mach tuck is usually caused by two things, a rearward movement of the [[center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|centre of pressure]] of the wing and a decrease in wing downwash velocity at the tailplane both of which cause a nose down pitching moment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ce560xl.com/files/High_Altitude_Aerodynamics.pdf critical aspects of mach flight e.&lt;/ref&gt; For a particular aircraft design only one of these may be significant in causing a tendency to dive, delta-winged aircraft with no foreplane or tailplane in the first case and, for example, the [[Lockheed P-38]]&lt;ref&gt;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19930092690.pdf p.4&lt;/ref&gt; in the second case. Alternatively, a particular design may have no significant tendency, for example the [[Fokker F28 Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;http://rahauav.com/Library/Aerodynamic/Aerodynamic_design_of_transport_aircraft_www.rahaUAV.com.pdf p.379&lt;/ref&gt;

As an aerofoil generating lift moves through the air, the air flowing over the top surface accelerates to a higher local speed than the air flowing over the bottom surface. When the aircraft speed reaches its [[critical Mach number]] the accelerated airflow locally reaches the speed of sound and creates a small shock wave, even though the aircraft is still travelling below the speed of sound.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J. (1975) ''Aerodynamics'', section 11.10, Pitman Publishing Limited, London. {{ISBN|0 273 01120 0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region in front of the shock wave generates high lift. As the aircraft itself flies faster, the shock wave over the wing gets stronger and moves rearwards, creating high lift further back along the wing. This rearward movement of lift causes the aircraft to tuck or pitch nose-down.

The severity of Mach tuck on any given design is affected by the thickness of the aerofoil, the sweep angle of the wing, and the location of the tailplane relative to the main wing.{{explain|date=October 2016}}

A tailplane which is positioned further aft can provide a larger stabilizing pitch-up moment.

The [[Camber (aerodynamics)|camber]] and thickness of the aerofoil affect the critical Mach number, with a more highly curved upper surface causing a lower critical Mach number.

On a swept wing the shock wave typically forms first at the [[wing root]], especially if it is more cambered than the [[wing tip]]. As speed increases, the shock wave and associated lift extend outwards and, because the wing is swept, backwards.

The changing airflow over the wing can reduce the [[downwash]] over a conventional tailplane, promoting a stronger nose-down pitching moment.

Another problem with a separate horizontal stabiliser is that it can itself achieve local supersonic flow with its own shock wave. This can affect the operation of a conventional elevator control surface.

Aircraft without enough elevator authority to maintain trim and fly level can enter a steep, sometimes unrecoverable dive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the aircraft is supersonic, the faster top shock wave can reduce the authority of the elevator and horizontal stabilizers.&lt;ref name="selkirk"&gt;[http://selair.selkirk.bc.ca/aerodynamics1/High-Speed/Page2e.html Transonic Aircraft Design] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614103204/http://selair.selkirk.bc.ca/aerodynamics1/High-Speed/Page2e.html |date=2007-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All transonic and supersonic aircraft experience Mach tuck.

==Recovery==
Recovery is sometimes impossible in subsonic aircraft; however, as an aircraft descends into lower, warmer, denser air, [[control authority]] may return because drag tends to slow the aircraft while the speed of sound and control authority both increase.

To prevent Mach stall from progressing, the pilot should keep the airspeed below the type's critical Mach number by reducing [[throttle]], extending [[air brake (aircraft)|speed brakes]], and if possible, extending the [[landing gear]].

==Design features==

A number of design techniques are used to counter the effects of Mach tuck.

On both conventional tailplane and [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] foreplane configurations, the horizontal stabiliser may be made large and powerful enough to correct the large trim changes associated with Mach tuck. In place of the conventional elevator control surface, the whole stabiliser may be made moveable or "all-flying", sometimes called a [[stabilator]]. This both increases the authority of the stabilizer over a wider range of aircraft pitch, but also avoids the controllability issues associated with a separate elevator.&lt;ref name="selkirk" /&gt;

Aircraft that fly supersonic for long periods, such as [[Concorde]], may compensate for Mach tuck by moving fuel between tanks in the fuselage to change the position of the [[centre of mass]] to match  the changing location of the centre of pressure, thereby minimize the amount of aerodynamic trim required.

A Mach trimmer is a device which varies the pitch trim automatically as a function of Mach number to oppose Mach tuck and maintain level flight.

==History==
[[File:Lockheed P-38H Lightning - 1.jpg|thumb|The [[P-38 Lightning]] gave [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] engineers a great deal of initial design trouble because it was so fast that it was the first American aircraft to experience [[Compressibility#Aeronautical dynamics|compressibility]] and Mach tuck.]] The fastest [[Air warfare of World War II|World War II fighters]] were the first aircraft to experience Mach tuck.   Their wings were not designed to counter Mach tuck because research on supersonic airfoils was just beginning; areas of supersonic flow, together with shock waves and flow separation,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John D. Jr. ''Introduction to Flight'', Third Edition, McGraw Hill Book Company, {{ISBN|0-07-001641-0}}, Figure 5.17 point c and Figure 5.20&lt;/ref&gt; were present on the wing. This condition was known at the time as compressibility burble and was known to exist on propeller tips at high aircraft speeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1935/naca-tn-543.pdf NACA Report]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[P-38 Lightning|P-38]] was the first 400&amp;nbsp;mph fighter, and it suffered more than the usual teething troubles.&lt;ref name=Bodie&gt;Bodie, Warren M. ''The Lockheed P-38 Lightning: The Definitive Story of Lockheed's P-38 Fighter''. Hayesville, North Carolina: Widewing Publications, 2001, 1991. {{ISBN|0-9629359-5-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a thick, high-lift wing,  distinctive [[twin boom]]s and a single, central [[nacelle]] containing the cockpit and armament.  It quickly accelerated to terminal velocity in a dive. The short stubby fuselage had a detrimental effect in reducing the critical Mach number of the 15% thick wing center section with high velocities over the canopy adding to those on the upper surface of the wing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/1947/naca-rm-a7c24.pdf NACA Report] p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Mach tuck occurred at speeds above Mach&amp;nbsp;0.65;&lt;ref name=erickson&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a800790.pdf Erickson report] p.3&lt;/ref&gt; the air flow over the wing center section became [[Transonic speed|transonic]], causing a loss of lift. The resultant change in downwash at the tail caused a nose-down pitching moment and the dive to steepen (Mach tuck). The aircraft was very stable in this condition&lt;ref name=erickson
/&gt; making recovery from the dive very difficult. Dive recovery (auxiliary)&lt;ref&gt;Abzug and Larrabee, ''Airplane Stability and Control'', Cambridge University Press 2002, {{ISBN|0-521-02128-6}}, p.165&lt;/ref&gt; flaps were added to the underside of the wing (P-38J-LO) to increase the wing lift and downwash at the tail to allow recovery from transonic dives.

The '''Maritime College of Forest Technology''' (French: '''Collège de Technologie forestière des Maritimes''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] post-secondary college with campuses located in [[Fredericton]], [[New Brunswick]] (English instruction) and [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]], [[New Brunswick]] (French instruction).

==History==

The Maritime College of Forest Technology (MCFT), formerly the Maritime Forest Ranger School (MFRS), in Fredericton, New Brunswick was established in April 1946, as a co-operative effort of the provincial governments of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]], and the wood-using industries of the two provinces. The MCFT fulfils a regional mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Supporting the contribution of Higher Education Institutions to Regional Development within Atlantic Canada by Dr. Wade Locke. The Harris Centre. Memorial University of Newfoundland. December, 2006. Accessed 11 May 2015 at https://www.mun.ca/harriscentre/reports/arf/2006/FinalReportEduRegDevelLocke.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The original location for MFRS was on the grounds owned by the [[University of New Brunswick]] which housed Alexander College and is known today as the Fredericton Exhibition Grounds. In 1949 MFRS moved to its new location overlooking the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River Valley]]; at that time MFRS was the sole occupant of the land until the new campus was constructed in 1986. The current campus is part of the Hugh John Flemming Forestry Centre and is shared with the [[Canadian Forest Service]] and [[Natural Resources Canada|Department of Natural Resources]]. Present facilities at the Fredericton Campus were completed in 1986. The francophone campus in [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]] was established in 1980 and the campus is shared with the [[Collège communautaire du Nouveau-Brunswick]].

From 1946 to 2003 the college was known as the Maritime Forest Ranger School and its curriculum was one year in length. In 2003 the college began its new two-year program and with that came the change in name to the Maritime College of Forest Technology.&lt;ref&gt;An Act to Amend An Act to Incorporate the Maritime Forest Ranger School. Accessed 11 May 2015 at http://www.gnb.ca/legis/bill/pdf/54/5/Bill-38.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 MCFT began offering, in addition to the Forest Technology Program, an Advanced Diploma in Forest and Fish &amp; Wildlife Technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcft.ca/en/explore/history/ Maritime College of Forest Technology: History]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- what is the thing that is move? what is the nature of the test or measurement on it? --&gt;

'''Motion system''' is a component of a [[Experiment|test]] and [[measurement]] [[system]] that provides motion to a [[Structural load|load]] or loads in a one or many directions.  Generally a motion system is made up of a set (or stack) of [[linear]] and [[rotational]] stages. A [[linear stage]] moves in a [[straight line]], while a rotation stage moves in a partial or full circle.  A stage can either be manually controlled with a knob control, or automated with a motion controller.

A motion system generally is computer controlled and can perform fast, reliable, repeatable, and accurate positioning of loads.  Most systems will support motion in X and Y directions, which is referred to as an XY stack.  Often either a Z axis (up/down motion) or R axis (rotational motion) is placed on top of the XY stack.

For automated stages, a scale can be attached to the internals of the stage and an encoder used to measure the position on the scale and report this to the controller, thereby determining the precise position of the stage.  This allows for a motion controller to reliably and repeatably move to set positions with the linear stage.

*[[Royal Society of Biology]]
*[[British Ecological Society]]
*[[James Hutton Institute]].

==Aims==
Its stated mission is "to support decision-making that results in the sustainable management of our natural capital based on sound science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/about/|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|publisher=National Capital Initiative|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to provide decision-makers from UK government, academia, business, and civil society with a high-level forum for cross-sectoral dialogue on how to realise the UK government's stated objective of embedding [[natural capital]] thinking in policy and practice, and it does this based upon sound evidence from across the natural and social sciences.&lt;ref name=CEH/&gt;

The four main objectives of the Natural Capital Initiative are to:

*Inform the Government's implementation of the [[Ecosystem Approach|ecosystems approach]] - a framework for looking at whole ecosystems in decision-making and valuing the services they provide.
*Identify gaps in science, policy and implementation that inhibit an ecosystems approach.
*Work with government, parliament, agencies, [[NGO]]s, the private sector, scientific bodies and the wider public.
*Inspire the next generation to engage in the sustainable use of the natural environment.

==History==
[[File:Natural Capital graphic.jpg|thumb|[[Natural Capital]] provides us with essential functions and [[ecosystem services]].The NCI supports the UK government and policy-makers in putting natural capital at the heart of economic decision-making.]]
The NCI was established in 2009 in response to the increasing global awareness of the need for more sustainable management of the world's limited natural resources,&lt;ref name="education"&gt;{{cite web|title=Educating human capital for the preservation of natural capital|url=http://consciouscomms.com/educating-human-capital-for-the-preservation-of-natural-capital/|website=consciouscomms.com|publisher=Conscious Communications|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as highlighted by the 2005 [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of the Milliennium Ecosystem Assessment|url=http://millenniumassessment.org/en/About.html|website=millenniumassessment.org|publisher=Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|accessdate=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in April 2009 at a three-day [[symposium]] held in London, entitled ''Valuing our Life Support Systems''. Its conclusions were published in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuing Our Life Support Systems: Symposium Report|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nci_full_lo-2.pdf|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|accessdate=4 March 2016|date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuing Our Life Support Systems: Symposium Report Executive Summary|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nci_summary_lo-2.pdf|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|publisher=Natural Capital Initiative|accessdate=4 March 2016|date=1 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DEFRA&gt;{{cite web|title=What nature can do for you|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/396840/pb13897-nature-do-for-you.pdf|website=www.gov.uk|publisher=DEFRA|accessdate=7 March 2016|page=23|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the James Hutton Institute announced it was joining the partnership.&lt;ref name=Hutton&gt;{{cite web|title=James Hutton Institute joins the Natural Capital Initiative|url=http://www.hutton.ac.uk/news/james-hutton-institute-joins-natural-capital-initiative|website=www.hutton.ac.uk|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 the NCI held a second major symposium/summit, entitled: ‘Valuing our Life Support Systems’ with the aim of pushing forward the shared natural capital agenda.&lt;ref name=CEH/&gt;

The Chair of the NCI (as at 2016) is Professor Alison Hester of the [[James Hutton Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCI Chair|url=http://www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk/secretariat/|website=www.naturalcapitalinitiative.org.uk|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The Natural Capital Initiative has been recognised as one of the key groups or organisations in the UK now examining the main issues surrounding the depletion of natural resources and in encouraging the preservation of natural capital.&lt;ref name=Hutton/&gt; 

Its 2009 symposium recommendations are included in the UK government own recommendations and resource documents to senior policy-makers.&lt;ref name=DEFRA/&gt;

In recent years the NCI's support for the development of high-level policy based on sound science, and in line with an ecosystems approach to decision-making, has transferred into reality in a number of ways. In particular, the [[Natural Capital Committee]], supported by [[DEFRA]], evolved out of the UK Government's 2011 'Natural Environment White Paper', as did the 48 [[Local Nature Partnership]]s now established across England which focus on sustainable land management, greening economic growth and human health and wellbeing.&lt;ref name=education/&gt;

In 2014 the NCI called on the UK government to introduce a [[natural capital accounting]] element into its [[National accounts|national accounting framework]], and supported the Natural Capital Committee's own proposal for a 25-year Government plan for the UK Natural Environment, which is now under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Initiative urges Government act now to reverse decline in natural capital|url=https://www.rsb.org.uk/news/14-news/1122-natural-capital-initiative-urges-government-to-act-now-to-reverse-decline-in-natural-capital|website=www.rsb.org.uk|publisher=Royal Society of Biology|accessdate=5 March 2016|date=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government will produce a 25 year plan for the natural environment|url=http://esinternational.com/government-will-produce-a-25-year-plan-for-the-natural-environment/|website=esinternational.com|publisher=ESI|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the NCI published a symposium report, entitled 'Valuing our Life Support Systems', which was launched at a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliamentary]] event on 25 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuing our Life Support Systems Report Launch|url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/offices/bicameral/post/post-events/valuing-our-life-support-systems-report-launch-/|website=www.parliament.uk|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=6 March 2016|date=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch was chaired by [[Barry Gardiner|Barry Gardiner MP]]. The report spelled out the need for a methodology to be established for valuing natural capital. It also raised concerns there was a danger that natural capital could be treated as a commodity unless an ethical framework was in place to ensure the process of natural capital valuation was applied fairly and evenly. It urged that all natural capital concepts needed to be clear, evidence-based and robust, and it welcomed the Government's proposal to extend the life of the Natural Capital Committee until at least the end of that current parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Initiative: Valuing our Life Support Systems Report|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/Valuingourlifesupportsystemssummaryfinal.pdf|website=www.parliament.uk|publisher=Houses of Parliament|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ocean general circulation models''' (OGCMs) are a particular kind of [[general circulation model]] to describe physical and thermodynamical processes in oceans. The oceanic general circulation is defined as the horizontal space scale and time scale larger than mesoscale (of order 100&amp;nbsp;km and 6 months).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} They depict oceans using a three-dimensional grid that include active [[thermodynamics]] and hence are most directly applicable to climate studies. They are the most advanced tools currently available for simulating the response of the global ocean system to increasing [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc-data.org/guidelines/pages/gcm_guide.html |title=What is a GCM? |publisher=Ipcc-data.org |date=2013-06-18 |accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hierarchy of OGCMs have been developed that include varying degrees of spatial coverage, resolution, geographical realism, process detail, etc.

==History==
The first generation of OGCMs assumed “rigid lid” to eliminate high-speed external [[gravity waves]]. According to CFL criteria without those fast waves, we can use a bigger time step, which is not so computationally expensive. But it also filtered those ocean tides and other waves having the speed of [[tsunamis]]. Within this assumption Bryan and co-worker Cox developed a 2D model, a 3D box model, and then a model of full circulation in [[GFDL]], with variable density as well, for the world ocean with its complex coastline and bottom topography.&lt;ref&gt;K. Bryan, J. Comput. Phys. 4, 347 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; The first application with specified global geometry was done in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Cox, in Numerical Models of Ocean Circulation (National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC, 1975), pp. 107 120&lt;/ref&gt; Cox designed a 2° latitude-longitude grid with up to 12 vertical levels at each point.

With more and more research on ocean model, mesoscale phenomenon, e.g. most [[ocean currents]] have crossstream dimensions equal to [[Rossby radius of deformation]], started to get more awareness. However, in order to analyze those [[eddies]] and currents in numerical models, we need grid spacing to be approximately 20&amp;nbsp;km in middle latitudes. Thanks to those faster computers and further filtering the equations in advance to remove internal gravity waves, those major currents and low-frequency eddies then can be resolved, one example is the three-layer [[Quasi-geostrophic equations|quasi-geostrophic]] models designed by Holland.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Holland, J. Phys. Oceanogr. 8, 363 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile there are some model retaining internal gravity wave, for example one adiabatic layered model by O'Brien and his students, which did retain internal gravity waves so that equatorial and coastal problems involving these waves could be treated, led to an initial understanding of El Niño in terms of those waves.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Busalacchi and J. J. O'Brien, ibid. 10, 1929 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, simulations could finally be undertaken using the GFDL formulation with eddies marginally resolved over extensive domains and with observed winds and some atmospheric influence on density.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbari.org/staff/braccio/science/semtner.html Albert J. Semtner]&lt;/ref&gt; Further more these simulation with high  enough resolution such as the Southern Ocean south of latitude 25°,&lt;ref&gt;The FRAM Group, Eos 72, 169 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; the North Atlantic,&lt;ref&gt;F. O. Bryan, C. W. Böning, W. R. Holland, J. Phys. Oceanogr. 25, 289 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and the World Ocean without the Arctic &lt;ref&gt;A. J. Semtner and R. M Chervin, J. Geophys. Res. 97, 5493 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; provided first side-by-side comparison with data.
Early in the 1990s, for those large scale and eddies resolvable models the computer requirement for the 2D ancillary problem associated with the rigid lid approximation was becoming excessive. Further more, in order to predict tidal effects or compare height data from satellites, methods were developed to predict the height and pressure of the ocean surface directly. For example, one method is to treat the free surface and the vertically averaged velocity using many small steps in time for each single step of the full 3D model.&lt;ref&gt;P. D. Killworth, D. Stainforth, D. J. Webb, S. M. Paterson, J. Phys. Oceanogr. 21, 1333 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Another method developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory solves the same 2D equations using an implicit method for the free surface.&lt;ref&gt;J. K. Dukowicz and R. D. Smith, J. Geophys. Res. 99, 7991 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Both methods are quite efficient.

==Importance==
OGCMs have many important applications: dynamical coupling with the atmosphere, sea ice, and land run-off that in reality jointly determine the oceanic boundary fluxes; transpire of biogeochemical materials; interpretation of the paleoclimate record;climate prediction for both natural variability and anthropogenic chafes; data assimilation and fisheries and other biospheric management.&lt;ref&gt;Chassignet, Eric P., and Jacques Verron, eds. Ocean modeling and parameterization. No. 516. Springer, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; OGCMs play a critical role in [[Global climate model|Earth system model]]. They maintain the thermal balance as they transport energy from tropical to the polar latitudes. To analyze the feedback between ocean and atmosphere we need ocean model, which can initiate and amplify climate change on many different time scales, for instance, the interannual variability of [[El Niño]] &lt;ref&gt;S. G. Philander, El Niño, La Nina, and the Southern Oscillation (Academic Press, San Diego, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; and the potential modification of the major patterns for oceanic heat transport as a result of increasing greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;S. Manabe and R. J. Stouffer, Nature 364, 215 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Oceans are a kind of undersampled nature fluid system, so by using OGCMs we can fill in those data blank and improve understanding of basic processes and their interconnectedness, as well as to help interpret sparse observations. Even though, simpler models can be used to estimate climate response, only OGCM can be used conjunction with atmospheric general circulation model to estimate global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Showstack, Randy. "IPCC Report Calls Climate Changes Unprecedented." Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union 94.41 (2013): 363–363&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgridscale parameterization==
[[File:Family tree of sub-gridscale mixing schemes.png|thumb|ocean parameterization scheme family tree]]

Molecular friction rarely upsets the dominant balances (geostrophic and hydrostatic) in the ocean. With kinematic viscosities of  v=10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;m &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;  the Ekman number is several orders of magnitude smaller than unity; therefore, molecular frictional forces are certainly negligible for large-scale oceanic motions. Similar argument holds for the tracer equations, where the molecular thermodiffusivity and salt diffusivity lead to Reynolds number of negligible magnitude, which means the molecular diffusive time scales are much longer than advective time scale. So we can thus safely conclude that the direct effects of molecular processes are insignificant for large-scale. Yet the molecular friction is essential somewhere. The point is that large-scale motions in the ocean interacted with other scales by the nonlinearities in primitive equation. We can show that by Reynolds approach, which will leads to the closure problem. That means new variables arise at each level in the Reynolds averaging procedure.  This leads to the need of parameterization scheme to account for those sub grid scale effects.

Here is a schematic “family tree” of subgridscale (SGS) mixing schemes. Although there is considerable degree of overlap and inter relatedness among the huge variety of schemes in use today, several branch points maybe defined. Most importantly, the approaches for lateral and vertical subgridscale closure vary considerably. Filters and higher-order operators are used to remove small-scale noise that is numerically necessary. Those special dynamical parameterizations (topographic stress, eddy thickness diffusion and convection) are becoming available for certain processes. 
In the vertical, the surface mixed layer (sml) has historically received special attention because of its important role in air-sea exchange. Now there are so many schemes can be chose from: Price-Weller-Pinkel, Pacanowksi and Philander, bulk, Mellor-Yamada and KPP (k-profile parameterization) schemes.

Adaptive (non-constant) mixing length schemes are widely used for parameterization of both lateral and vertical mixing. In the horizontal, parameterizations dependent on the rates of stress and strain (Smagroinsky), grid spacing and Reynolds number (Re) have been advocated. In the vertical, vertical mixing as a function stability frequency (N^2) and/or Richardson number are historically prevalent. The rotated mixing tensors scheme is the one considering the angle of the principle direction of mixing, as for in the main thermocline, mixing along isopycnals dominates diapycnal mixing. There for the principle direction of mixing is neither strictly vertical nor purely horizontal, but a spatially variable mixture of the two.

==Comparison with Atmospheric General Circulation Model==
OGCMs and [[Global climate model|AGCMs]] have much in common, such as, the equations of motion and the numerical techniques. However, OGCMs have some unique features. For example, the atmosphere is forced thermally throughout its volume, the ocean is forced both thermally and mechanically primarily at its surface, in addition, the geometry of ocean basins is very complex.  The boundary conditions are totally different. For ocean models, we need to consider those narrow but important boundary layers on nearly all bounding surfaces as well as within the oceanic interior. These boundary conditions on ocean flows are difficult to define and to parameterize, which results in a high computationally demand.

Ocean modeling is also strongly constrained by the existence in much of the world’s oceans of mesoscale eddies with time and space scales, respectively, of weeks to months and tens to hundreds of kilometers. Dynamically, these nearly geostrophic turbulent eddies are the oceanographic counterparts of the atmospheric synoptic scale. Nevertheless, there are important differences. First, ocean eddies are not perturbations on an energetic mean flow. They may play an important role in the poleward transport of heat. Second, they are relatively small in horizontal extent so that ocean climate models, which must have the same overall exterior dimensions as AGCMs, may require as much as 20 times the resolution as AGCM if the eddies are to be explicitly resolved.

Most of the difference between OGCMs and AGCMs is that the data are sparser for OGCMs. Also, the data are not only sparse but also nonuniform and indirect{{explanation needed|date=January 2018}}.

==Classification==
We can classify ocean models according to different standards. For example, according to vertical ordinates we have geo-potential, isopycnal and topography-following models.  According to horizontal discretizations we have unstaggered or staggered grids.  According to methods of approximation we have finite difference and finite element models. There are three basic types of OGCMs: 

1. Idealized geometry models 

Models with idealized basin geometry have been used extensively in ocean modeling and have played a major role in the development of new modeling methodologies. They use a simplified geometry, offering a basin itself, while the distribution of winds and buoyancy force are generally chosen as simple functions of latitude.

2. Basin-scale models

To compare OGCM results with observations we need realistic basin information instead of idealized data. However, if we only pay attention to local observation data, we don’t need to run whole global simulation, and by doing that we can save a lot of computational resources. 

3. Global models 

This kind of model is the most computationally costly one. More experiments are needed as a preliminary step in constructing coupled Earth system models.

'''Osmotic power''', '''salinity gradient power''' or '''blue energy''' is the energy available from the difference in the salt concentration between [[seawater]] and [[fresh water|river water]]. Two practical methods for this are [[reverse electrodialysis]] (RED) and
[[pressure retarded osmosis]] (PRO). Both processes rely on [[osmosis]] with [[artificial membrane|membrane]]s. The key waste product is [[brackish water]]. This byproduct is the result of natural forces that are being harnessed: the flow of fresh water into seas that are made up of salt water.

In 1954, Pattle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=R.E. Pattle|title=Production of electric power by mixing fresh and salt water in the hydroelectric pile|journal=Nature|date=2 October 1954|volume=174|page=660|doi=10.1038/174660a0|issue=4431|bibcode=1954Natur.174..660P}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that there was an untapped source of power when a river mixes with the sea, in terms of the lost osmotic pressure, however it was not until the mid ‘70s where a practical method of exploiting it using selectively permeable membranes by Loeb &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=S. Loeb|title=Osmotic power plants|journal=Science|date=22 August 1975|volume=189|issue=4203|pages=654–655|doi=10.1126/science.189.4203.654|pmid=17838753|bibcode=1975Sci...189..654L}}&lt;/ref&gt; was outlined.

The method of generating power by pressure retarded osmosis was invented by Prof. [[Sidney Loeb]] in 1973 at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel.&lt;ref&gt;^ Israel Patent Application 42658 of July 3, 1973. (see also {{patent|US|3906250|title=Method and apparatus for generating power utilizing pressure-retarded-osmosis}} Erroneously shows Israel priority as 1974 instead of 1973 {{patent|US|3906250|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea came to Prof. Loeb, in part, as he observed the Jordan River flowing into the Dead Sea. He wanted to harvest the energy of mixing of the two aqueous solutions (the Jordan River being one and the Dead Sea being the other) that was going to waste in this natural mixing process.&lt;ref&gt;^ Weintraub, Bob.

The technologies have been confirmed in laboratory conditions. They are being developed into commercial use in the Netherlands (RED) and Norway (PRO). The cost of the membrane has been an obstacle. A new, lower cost membrane, based on an electrically modified [[polyethylene]] plastic, made it fit for potential commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.statkraft.com/Images/Faktaark%20OSMOTIC%20ENG_tcm4-7797.pdf History of osmotic power (PDF) at archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods have been proposed and are currently under development.

==Basics of salinity gradient power==
[[Image:Blue energy mechanism.png|thumb|right|Pressure-retarded osmosis]]
Salinity gradient power is a specific renewable energy alternative that creates renewable and sustainable power by using naturally occurring processes. This practice does not contaminate or release [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions (vapor pressure methods will release dissolved air containing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at low pressures—these non-condensable gases can be re-dissolved of course, but with an energy penalty). Also as stated by Jones and Finley within their article “Recent Development in Salinity Gradient Power”, there is basically no fuel cost.

Salinity gradient energy is based on using the resources of “osmotic pressure difference between fresh water and sea water.”&lt;ref&gt;(Jones, A.T., W. Finley. “Recent developments in salinity gradient power”. Oceans. 2003. 2284-2287.)&lt;/ref&gt; All energy that is proposed to use salinity gradient technology relies on the evaporation to separate water from salt. Osmotic pressure is the "chemical potential of concentrated and dilute solutions of salt".&lt;ref&gt;(Brauns, E. “Toward a worldwide sustainable and simultaneous large-scale production of renewable energy and potable water trough salinity gradient power by combining reversed electrodialysis and solar power?” Environmental Process and Technology. Jan 2007. 312-323.)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking at relations between high osmotic pressure and low, solutions with higher concentrations of salt have higher pressure.

Differing salinity gradient power generations exist but one of the most commonly discussed is [[pressure-retarded osmosis]] (PRO). Within PRO seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber where the pressure is lower than the difference between fresh and salt water pressure. Fresh water moves in a semipermeable membrane and increases its volume in the chamber. As the pressure in the chamber is compensated a turbine spins to generate electricity. In Braun's article he states that this process is easy to understand in a more broken down manner. Two solutions, A being salt water and B being fresh water are separated by a membrane. He states "only water molecules can pass the semipermeable membrane. As a result of the osmotic pressure difference between both solutions, the water from solution B thus will diffuse through the membrane in order to dilute solution A".&lt;ref&gt;(Brauns, E. “Toward a worldwide sustainable and simultaneous large-scale production of renewable energy and potable water through salinity gradient power by combining reversed electrodialysis and solar power?.” ''Environmental Process and Technology''. Jan 2007. 312-323.)&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure drives the turbines and power the generator that produces the electrical energy. Osmosis might be used directly to "pump" fresh water out of The Netherlands into the sea. This is currently done using electric pumps.

==Efficiency==
A 2012 study on efficiency from Yale university concluded that the highest extractable work in constant-pressure PRO with a seawater draw solution and river water feed solution is 0.75 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; while the free energy of mixing is 0.81 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;—a thermodynamic extraction efficiency of 91.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/es300060m | pmid=22463483 | volume=46 | issue=9 | title=Thermodynamic and Energy Efficiency Analysis of Power Generation from Natural Salinity Gradients by Pressure Retarded Osmosis | year=2012 | journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | pages=5230–5239 | last1 = Yin Yip | first1 = Ngai | last2 = Elimelech | first2 = Menachem| bibcode=2012EnST...46.5230Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
While the mechanics and concepts of salinity gradient power are still being studied, the power source has been implemented in several different locations. Most of these are experimental, but thus far they have been predominantly successful. The various companies that have utilized this power have also done so in many different ways as there are several concepts and processes that harness the power from salinity gradient.

===Pressure-retarded osmosis===
[[File:Simplistic pressure retarded osmosis power generation diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Simple PRO power generation scheme]]
[[File:Hurum osmosis power 02.JPG|250px|thumbnail|right|Osmotic Power Prototype at Tofte (Hurum), Norway]]
One method to utilize salinity gradient energy is called [[pressure-retarded osmosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TGK-4MDGP8H-1&amp;_user=607017&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=607017&amp;md5=acc4682fd086886dff4b0cb1ee6123df Salinity-gradient power: Evaluation of pressure-retarded osmosis and reverse electrodialysis]&lt;/ref&gt; In this method, seawater is pumped into a pressure chamber that is at a pressure lower than the difference between the pressures of saline water and fresh water. Freshwater is also pumped into the pressure chamber through a membrane, which increase both the volume and pressure of the chamber. As the pressure differences are compensated, a turbine is spun, providing kinetic energy. This method is being specifically studied by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[public utility|utility]] [[Statkraft]], which has calculated that up to 2.85 GW would be available from this process in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waderllc.com/2284-2287.pdf Recent Developments in Salinity Gradient Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901211414/http://waderllc.com/2284-2287.pdf |date=2011-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statkraft has built the world's first [[Statkraft osmotic power prototype in Hurum|prototype PRO power plant]] on the Oslo fjord which was opened by [[Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway|Princess Mette-Marit of Norway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/statkraft-osmotic-power/13451/ |title=The world's first osmotic power plant from Statkraft |accessdate=2009-11-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812024125/http://www.gizmag.com/statkraft-osmotic-power/13451/ |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }} Statkraft-osmotic-power&lt;/ref&gt; on November 24, 2009. It aims to produce enough electricity to light and heat a small town within five years by osmosis. At first, it will produce a minuscule 4 kilowatts – enough to heat a large electric kettle, but by 2015 the target is 25 megawatts – the same as a small wind farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8377186.stm BBC News Norway's Statkraft opens first osmotic power plant]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 however Statkraft announced not to continue this pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forwardosmosistech.com/statkraft-discontinues-investments-in-pressure-retarded-osmosis/ |title=Is PRO economically feasible?

===Reversed electrodialysis===
A second method being developed and studied is [[reversed electrodialysis]] or reverse dialysis, which is essentially the creation of a salt battery. This method was described by Weinstein and Leitz as “an array of alternating anion and cation exchange membranes can be used to generate electric power from the free energy of river and sea water.”

The technology related to this type of power is still in its infant stages, even though the principle was discovered in the 1950s. Standards and a complete understanding of all the ways salinity gradients can be utilized are important goals to strive for in order make this clean energy source more viable in the future.

===Capacitive method===
A third method is [[Doriano Brogioli]]'s&lt;ref name="Brogioli" /&gt; capacitive method, which is relatively new and has so far only been tested on lab scale. With this method energy can be extracted out of the mixing of saline water and freshwater by cyclically charging up [[electrode]]s in contact with saline water, followed by a discharge in freshwater. Since the amount of electrical energy which is needed during the charging step is less than one gets out during the discharge step, each completed cycle effectively produces energy. An intuitive explanation of this effect is that the great number of [[ion]]s in the saline water efficiently neutralizes the charge on each electrode by forming a thin layer of opposite charge very close to the electrode surface, known as an [[double layer (interfacial)|electric double layer]]. Therefore, the [[voltage]] over the electrodes remains low during the charge step and charging is relatively easy. In between the charge and discharge step, the electrodes are brought in contact with freshwater. After this, there are less ions available to neutralize the charge on each electrode such that the voltage over the electrodes increases. The discharge step which follows is therefore able to deliver a relatively high amount of energy. A physical explanation is that on an electrically charged capacitor, there is a mutually attractive [[electric force]] between the [[electric charge]] on the electrode, and the ionic charge in the liquid. In order to pull ions away from the charged electrode, osmotic pressure must do [[work (physics)|work]]. This work done increases the electrical potential energy in the capacitor. An electronic explanation is that [[capacitance]] is a function of ion density. By introducing a salinity gradient and allowing some of the ions to diffuse out of the capacitor, this reduces the capacitance, and so the voltage must increase, since the voltage equals the ratio of charge to capacitance.

===Vapor pressure differences: open cycle and absorption refrigeration cycle (closed cycle)===
Both of these methods do not rely on membranes, so filtration requirements are not as important as they are in the PRO &amp; RED schemes.

====Open cycle====
Similar to the open cycle in ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC). The disadvantage of this cycle is the cumbersome problem of a large diameter turbine (75 meters +) operating at below atmospheric pressure to extract the power between the water with less salinity &amp; the water with greater salinity.

====Absorption refrigeration cycle (closed cycle)====
For the purpose of dehumidifying air, in a [[absorption refrigerator#Water spray absorption refrigeration|water-spray absorption refrigeration]] system, water vapor is dissolved into a [[deliquescent]] salt water mixture using osmotic power as an intermediary. The primary power source originates from a thermal difference, as part of a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] [[heat engine]] cycle.

===Solar pond===
At the Eddy Potash Mine in New Mexico, a technology called "salinity gradient [[solar pond]]" (SGSP) is being utilized to provide the energy needed by the mine. '''This method does not harness osmotic power''', only solar power (see: [[solar pond]]). Sunlight reaching the bottom of the saltwater pond is absorbed as heat. The effect of [[natural convection]], wherein "heat rises", is blocked using density differences between the three layers that make up the pond, in order to trap heat. The upper convection zone is the uppermost zone, followed by the stable gradient zone, then the bottom thermal zone. The stable gradient zone is the most important. The saltwater in this layer can not rise to the higher zone because the saltwater above has lower salinity and is therefore less-dense and more buoyant; and it can not sink to the lower level because that saltwater is denser. This middle zone, the stable gradient zone, effectively becomes an "insulator" for the bottom layer (although the main purpose is to block natural convection, since water is a poor insulator). This water from the lower layer, the storage zone, is pumped out and the heat is used to produce energy, usually by turbine in an [[organic Rankine cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/756432-k7Q3X9/webviewable/756432.pdf Salinity Gradient Solar Pond Technology Applied to Potash Solution Mining]&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory a solar pond ''could'' be used to generate osmotic power if evaporation from solar heat is used to create a salinity gradient, ''and'' the potential energy in this salinity gradient is ''harnessed directly'' using one of the first three methods above, such as the capacitive method.

===Boron nitride nanotubes===

A research team built an experimental system using boron nitride that produced much greater power than the Statoil prototype. It used an impermeable and electrically insulating membrane that was pierced by a single boron nitride nanotube with an external diameter of a few dozen nanometers. With this membrane separating a salt water reservoir and a fresh water reservoir, the team measured the electric current passing through the membrane using two electrodes immersed in the fluid either side of the nanotube.

The results showed the device was able to generate an electric current on the order of a nanoampere. The researchers claim this is 1,000 times the yield of other known techniques for harvesting osmotic energy and makes boron nitride nanotubes an extremely efficient solution for harvesting the energy of salinity gradients for usable electrical power.

The team claimed that a {{convert|1|m2}} membrane could generate around 4&amp;nbsp;kW and be capable of generating up to 30 MWh per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/osmotic-salinity-gradient-power-nanotubes/26623/ |title=Nanotubes boost potential of salinity power as a renewable energy source |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028032447/http://www.gizmag.com/osmotic-salinity-gradient-power-nanotubes/26623/ |archivedate=2013-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Using low caloric waste energy by regenerate a high solution ammonium bicarbonate in a solution with a low salinity===
At Pennsylvania State University, Dr. Logan tries to use waste heat with low calority using the fact that [[ammonium bicarbonate]] disappears into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in warm water to form ammonia bicarbonate again in cold water. So in a RED energy producing closed system the two different gradients of salinity are kept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sites.psu.edu/energyfromwater/ |title=Energy from Water |accessdate=2017-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202195525/http://sites.psu.edu/energyfromwater/ |archivedate=2017-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible negative environmental impact==

Marine and river environments have obvious differences in water quality, namely salinity. Each species of aquatic plant and animal is adapted to survive in either marine, brackish, or freshwater environments. There are species that can tolerate both, but these species usually thrive best in a specific water environment. The main waste product of salinity gradient technology is brackish water. The discharge of brackish water into the surrounding waters, if done in large quantities and with any regularity, will cause salinity fluctuations. While some variation in salinity is usual, particularly where fresh water (rivers) empties into an ocean or sea anyway, these variations become less important for both bodies of water with the addition of brackish waste waters. Extreme salinity changes in an aquatic environment may result in findings of low densities of both animals and plants due to intolerance of sudden severe salinity drops or spikes.&lt;ref name=Montague&gt;Montague, C., Ley, J. A Possible Effect of Salinity Fluctuation on Abundance of Benthic Vegetation and Associated Fauna in Northeastern Florida Bay. Estuaries and Coasts. 1993. Springer New York. Vol.15 No. 4. Pg. 703-717&lt;/ref&gt; According to the prevailing environmentalist opinions, the possibility of these negative effects should be considered by the operators of future large blue energy establishments.

The impact of brackish water on ecosystems can be minimized by pumping it out to sea and releasing it into the mid-layer, away from the surface and bottom ecosystems.

Impingement and entrainment at intake structures are a concern due to large volumes of both river and sea water utilized in both PRO and RED schemes. Intake construction permits must meet strict environmental regulations and desalination plants and power plants that utilize surface water are sometimes involved with various local, state and federal agencies to obtain permission that can take upwards to 18 months.

== Introduction ==
Most of the advances in pulsar astronomy were due to the discovery of new objects. A major increase in search sensitivity has already started a new era of discovery at the Arecibo Observatory.

This increase in search sensitivity is due first and foremost by the ALFA receiver and the pulsar surveys it makes possible, which are now being carried by the Pulsar Consortium using the Arecibo 305 m radio telescope. Preliminary estimates (see below) indicate that the Arecibo Galactic plane survey using ALFA could find many hundreds of new pulsars. As of October 2018, we have already discovered a total of '''185 new pulsars'''.

The survey is targeting low [[Galactic coordinate system|Galactic latitudes]] (|b|≤5°) in the [[Galactic coordinate system|Galactic longitude]] ranges accessible by the Arecibo telescope (32°&lt;''l''&lt;77°) and 168°&lt;''l''&lt;214°). Upon completion, it is expected to find hundreds of new pulsars. Highlights from the survey include the discoveries of the second most relativistic binary pulsar known, PSR J1906+0746,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lorimer, Duncan R. |title=Arecibo Pulsar Survey Using ALFA.

The PALFA survey is carried out by an international consortium of scientists from the United States, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Australia, and France. The Principal Investigator of the PALFA survey is Prof. Victoria Kaspi of [[McGill University]].

== Data acquisition ==
With ALFA, 47 pointings are needed to cover one square degree, compared to about 330 pointings needed to cover one square degree with similar density with a single-pixel feed. Initially, the survey used the Wideband Arecibo Pulsar Processors (WAPPs) to detect the signal from ALFA's seven beams. These cover 100&amp;nbsp;MHz of band (with dual polarization capability), initially centered at 1420&amp;nbsp;MHz and now at 1440&amp;nbsp;MHz. For search purposes, 256-channel spectra are produced every 64&amp;nbsp;microseconds. In 2009, the survey transitioned to new and improved back-ends, the Mock polyphase filterbank spectrometers, which are capable of covering 300&amp;nbsp;MHz (from 1225&amp;nbsp;MHz to 1525&amp;nbsp;MHz, the bandwidth covered by ALFA) for each of the seven beams (see detailed technical specifications here). This has led to greatly increased search sensitivity and better means to deal with all the radio frequency interference.

== Data processing and storage ==

Many of the detections to date have been made with a quick reduction package that allows us to find pulsars almost in real time. This is made possible by reducing the spectral and time resolution by a factor of 16, and using a computer cluster, the Arecibo Signal Processor to search for pulsars in the data. This is a nice and quick way of detecting slow pulsars, but the sensitivity to fast pulsars is severely degraded. Re-processing these data with full resolution is, computationally, a very challenging task but is essential for detecting many fast (both young and recycled) pulsars so far hidden by Galactic plasma.

It is expected that, over the next several years, this survey will generate over 1000&amp;nbsp;Terabytes of data. The data is stored at the [[Cornell University Center for Advanced Computing]]. The full-resolution raw data is processed independently by three software pipelines.

The [[Cornell University]] pipeline has conducted standard periodicity search and single-pulse search without doing an acceleration search. It has been run on all WAPP data archived at the Cornell University Center for Advanced Computing and has provided 2.5&amp;nbsp;million signal candidates. Winnowing of this vast set of candidates is currently under way.

The center of the Galaxy is indicated by the center of the coordinates, the position of the Solar System is indicated by the red dot on the left. The PALFA search areas are indicated in light blue. The dots indicate pulsars, this time colored according to their DM. The new PALFA discoveries are indicated by the larger dots. ]]
The second pipeline is based on PRESTO, a large suite of pulsar search and analysis software developed by Scott Ransom. It employs a [[Frequency domain|Fourier-domain]] acceleration search technique, which compensates for the loss of detection sensitivity in a traditional periodicity search due to a rapidly changing frequency of the periodic pulsar signal. Such frequency modulation can occur, for instance, due to a pulsar's orbital motion in a compact binary. This approach thus significantly boosts sensitivity to binary pulsars. The PRESTO pipeline is run on dedicated clusters at several institutions that participate in the ALFA survey, producing over 3&amp;nbsp;million signal candidates. Over the past two years, the Guillimin supercomputer, managed by [[McGill University]] as part of [[CLUMEQ]], has been processing most of the PALFA data with PRESTO.

Since March 2009, part of the Einstein@Home computing power is used to analyze PALFA data. The Einstein@Home algorithm is particularly sensitive to radio pulsars in tight binary systems (as short as 11&amp;nbsp;minutes), with a phase-space coverage that is complementary to that of the PRESTO pipeline. To date, it has re-detected 123 previously known radio pulsars as well as several previously unknown pulsars.

The data processed thus far has revealed that the radio frequency interference (RFI) environment at Arecibo significantly affects the detection threshold of the survey, creating unforeseen challenges in identifying the many weak pulsars that are likely lurking in the data. To address this, the PALFA consortium is actively developing novel techniques for identification, mitigation, and excision of RFI. We are also implementing a variety of heuristics as well as machine learning algorithms for identifying real pulsars among the millions of signal candidates, most of which appear to be due to RFI. The inevitable growth in the incidence and variety of man-made RFI suggests that this problem will likely be important for all future radio pulsar surveys.

[[File:Output130219080014.png|thumbnail|500px|Sky coverage map of the PALFA survey as of July 8, 2014]]

== Outreach efforts ==

The Arecibo Remote Command Center (ARCC) at the [[University of Texas at Brownsville]], the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]], and [[Franklin &amp; Marshall College]] is currently engaged in searching for radio pulsars in PALFA data. ARCC is an integrated research/education facility that allows students at the high school and undergraduate level to be directly involved with the research at the Arecibo telescope. Web based tools have been developed so that students can rank the pulsar candidates created by the PRESTO analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="890">'''Petasti''' (or Petaste; [[Greek language|Greek]]: πεταστη) is a [[neume]] of [[Byzantine chant]] notation, which is usually called a flutter in [[English language|English]]. In the most general form it means "Go one note up, and stress this note",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byzantinechant.org/notation/Table%20of%20Byzantine%20Notation%20Symbols.pdf Short table of Byzantine neumes]&lt;/ref&gt; where the "stress" is usually interpreted either as a [[mordent]] of Western music (in a high tempo), as a [[tuplet|triplet]] (in a medium [[tempo]]), or as a sequence of two [[eighth note]]s and a [[quarter note]] (in a slow tempo).

Petasti can also be combined with other neumes, such as [[oligon]], to form jumps of more than one note up, still stressed with a flutter.

Petasti [[Unicode]] symbol is U+1D049.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">'''Planetary-surface construction''' is the construction of artificial habitats and other structures on [[planetary surface]]s. Planetary surface construction can be divided into three phases or classes, coinciding with a phased schedule for habitation (Kennedy 2002, Smith 1993):

• Class I: Pre-integrated hard shell modules ready to use immediately upon delivery.

• Class II: Prefabricated [[kit-of-parts]] that is surface assembled after delivery.

• Class III: [[in-situ resource utilization]] (ISRU) derived structure with integrated Earth components.

Class I structures are prepared and tested on Earth, and are designed to be fully self-contained habitats that can be delivered to the surface of other planets. In an initial mission to put human explorers on Mars, a Class I habitat would provide the bare minimum habitable facilities when continued support from Earth is not possible.

The Class II structures call for a pre-manufactured kit-of-parts system that has flexible capacity for demountability and reuse. Class II structures can be used to expand the facilities established by the initial Class I habitat, and can allow for the assembly of additional structures either before the crew arrives, or after their occupancy of the pre-integrated habitat.

The purpose of Class III structures is to allow for the construction of additional facilities that would support a larger population, and to develop the capacity for the local production of building materials and structures without the need for resupply from Earth.

To facilitate the development of technology required to implement the three phases, Cohen and Kennedy (1997) stress the need to explore robust robotic system concepts that can be used to assist in the construction process, or perform the tasks autonomously. Among other things, they suggest a roadmap that stresses the need for adapting structural components for robotic assembly, and determining appropriate levels of modularity, assembly, and component packaging. The roadmap also sets the development of experimental construction systems in parallel with components as an important milestone.

'''Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics''' (RIASM) is the [[Academic department|Department]] of [[Mathematics]] of [[University of Madras]]. This name was adopted in 1967.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Department|url=http://www.unom.ac.in/index.php?route=department/department/about&amp;deptid=48|publisher=University of Madras|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Srinivasa Ramanujan - OPC - 1.jpg|thumb|[[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] (1887-1920)]]
The University of Madras was incorporated in 1857 and the Department of Mathematics was an integral part of the university from its beginning. The department developed from its early years to become a centre of research in mathematics with the appointment of [[R. Vaidyanathaswamy]] as a Reader in Mathematics in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;http://riasm.unom.ac.in/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The seeds of the Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics were sown when the "Ramanujan Institute of Mathematics" was established by [[Alagappa Chettiar]] on 26 January 1950 as a memorial to the mathematician [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]]. It was governed by the Asoka Charitable Trust, [[Karaikudi]], and was located at Krishna Vilas, [[Vepery]], [[Chennai]]. The Ramanujan Institute of Mathematics was inaugurated by A. Lakshmanaswamy Mudaliar, [[Vice Chancellor]] of University of Madras, with [[T. Vijayaraghavan]], a student of [[G.H. Hardy]], as Director of the Institute. The institute faced a financial crisis when, in  1956, Asoka Charitable Trust expressed its inability to run the institute. However, due to an initiative taken by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the management of the institute came to be vested with the University of Madras and the institute was taken over by the university in May 1957.

During the short period of existence, the institute had a string of prominent mathematicians as visitors, including [[S.S. Pillai]], noted number theorist, V. Ganapathy Iyer, analyst and [[Norbert Wiener]]. After the demise of T. Vijayaraghavan in 1955, C.T. Rajagopal took over as the Director of the Institute.

From 1957 to 1966, the Department of Mathematics and the Ramanujan Institute of Mathematics functioned as independent bodies under the University of Madras.&lt;ref&gt;http://riasm.unom.ac.in/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 the [[University Grants Commission (India)]] proposed to make the Department of Mathematics of the University of Madras into one of its Centres of Advanced Study. In the same year these two institutions were amalgamated to form a UGC Centre for Advanced Study in Mathematics and named the center as the "Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics" (RIASM).

C.T. Rajagopal was appointed the first Director of the Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics, and when he retired in 1969, the reins were taken over by T.S. Bhanumurthy.

==Ramanujan Museum==
Utilising a grant of Rs. 1 lakh received as UGC Special Assistance for Equipment and with the help of the Vikram A. Sarabhai Community Science Centre, [[Ahmedabad]] a Mathematical Laboratory  was established in the institute.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ramanujanmuseum.org/&lt;/ref&gt; About 65 mathematical models were acquired under the scheme. These models were exhibited

* for the participants of several Refresher Courses conducted through the Academic Staff College of the University of Madras,
* at the Silver Jubiliee conference of the Association of Mathematics Teachers of India held at Madras during 10–13 January 1991,
* in the Science Exhibition held at National Institute of Technology, [[Tiruchirapalli]] during 10–14 July 1991, and
* are being lent to be exhibited in several schools in and around [[Chennai]].

Later the institute received an amount of Rs. 2 lakh from the [[National Board for Higher Mathematics]], Rs. 1 lakh from ''[[The Hindu]]'' newspaper and Rs. 9 lakh from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Government of India, and a matching grant of Rs. 9 lakh from the University of Madras.  The amount was used to establish the Ramanujan Museum in the premises of the Ramanujan Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics. A grant of rupees one crore was later sanctioned by the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, towards the establishment of Ramanujan Museum and Research Centre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6874">The '''Wayne State University School of Information Sciences (SIS)''' is a school of [[information science]] at [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit]].  Prior to August 2017, the school was known as the School of Library and Information Science. The school has been accredited by the [[American Library Association]] since 1967 and offers programs leading to master's degrees in both library and information science and the science of information management.  In 2017, the school was ranked 22nd by the [[U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Global University Ranking]] among library and information science studies programs.

==History==
The school dates to 1918 when the Detroit Normal Training School, as Wayne was then known, began offering librarianship classes.  In the 1930s, the school's teacher training program began issuing bachelor's degrees with a minor in library science.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

In 1967, Wayne's library and information science program, then part of Wayne's College of Education, was accredited by the American Library Association to grant master's degrees in library and information science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=School of Library and Information Science|publisher=Wayne State University|accessdate=March 26, 2018|url=https://wayne.edu/facts/2016/schools-colleges/lis/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Wayne's library and information science program gained independence as the Library and Information Science Program.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; Robert Holley served as the director of the program from approximately 1993 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert Holley|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=August 16, 1999|page=2B|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18671093/robert_holley/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by Patricia Senn Breivik. She, in turn, was succeeded by Joseph J. Mika.

In 1997, Wayne opened a new 300,000-square foot undergraduate library, built at a cost of $37-million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A place for undergrads: Wayne State's newest library will aim for informed beginnings|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=August 27, 1997|page=3B|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18671435/a_place_for_undergrads_wayne_states/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program became the School of Library and Information Science in 2009.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the School|publisher=Wayne State University|accessdate=March 23, 2018|url=http://sis.wayne.edu/about/history.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, the school changed its name to the School of Information Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: SLIS is now the School of Information Sciences|publisher=Wayne State University|date=August 21, 2017|url=http://sis.wayne.edu/news.php?id=26979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandra Yee was the school's dean from 2001 until her retirement in July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sandra (Sandy) Yee|publisher=[[OCLC|OCLC Online Computer Library Center]]|accessdate=March 26, 2018|url=https://www.oclc.org/en/about/leadership/profiles/yee-sandra.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sandra Yee|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=March 26, 2018|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=60041459&amp;privcapId=957934&amp;previousCapId=278614&amp;previousTitle=HUNTINGTON%20BANCSHARES%20INC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Yee spoke in opposition to the Patriot Act, arguing that it "could have a chilling effect on research and intellectual freedom, which are critical to our nation’s freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miller Canfield, Wayne State University Present "The Impact of the USA PATRIOT Act on the University"|publisher=Miller Canfield|date=September 8, 2004|url=https://www.millercanfield.com/newsevents-news-569.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jon Cawthorn was appointed as dean of the school effective August 1, 2017. Cawthorn was previously the dean of libraries at [[West Virginia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jon E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23647">The emergence of [[social media]] has changed the way in which political communication takes place in the [[Politics of the United States|United States]]. Political institutions such as politicians, [[political parties]], foundations, institutions, and political [[think tank]]s are all using social media platforms, like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], to communicate with and engage voters. Regular individuals, politicians, "[[pundit]]s" and [[thought leader]]s alike are able to voice their opinions, engage with a wide network, and connect with other likeminded individuals.&lt;ref name="Kearney2013"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kearney|first=Michael||date=2013|title=Political Discussion on Facebook: An Analysis of Interpersonal Goals and Disagreement|publisher= University of Kansas|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1808/12975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The active participation of social media users has been an increasingly important element in political communication, especially during political elections in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Skogerbø &amp; Arne H. Krumsvik, "Newspapers, Facebook and Twitter: Intermedial agenda setting in local election campaigns," Journalism Practice (2015) 9#3 DOI:10.1080/17512786.2014.950471&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media are changing the nature of political communication because they are tools that can be used to inform and mobilize users in new ways. Users are able to connect directly to politicians and campaign managers and engage in political activities in new ways. Each social media platform is programmed in code by developers, creating a unique digital architecture that influences how politicians and citizens can use the platform for political ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bossetta|first=Michael|date=March 2018|title=The Digital Architectures of Social Media: Comparing Political Campaigning on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat in the 2016 U.S. Election|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077699018763307|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|volume=95(2)|pages=471-496|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by simply pressing the "[[like button]]" on [[Facebook]] or by following someone on [[Twitter]], users have the ability to connect with others and express their views in new ways. The option for users to share, like, or [[retweet]] political messages instantly has opened up a new avenue for politicians to reach out to voters. At the same time, social media campaigns can carry risks that are not present on traditional platforms, such as TV or newspaper ads. Whereas the political party controls all of the messaging on a TV or newspaper ad, in a social media campaign, critics and opposing party supporters can post negative comments immediately below campaign messages.

Politicians have a platform to communicate with that is different from the mainstream media. Politicians have the ability to raise large amounts of money in relatively short periods of time through social media campaigns. In 2012 president Obama raised over a billion dollars for his campaign, which broke the fundraising record. Around $690 million was raised through online donations including social media, email, and website donations and more money was raised from small donors than ever before.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Scherer, Michael. “Exclusive: Obama’s 2012 Digital Fundraising Outperformed 2008.” Time. November 15, 2012. http://swampland.time.com/2012/11/15/exclusive-obamas-2012-digital-fundraising-outperformed-2008/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on elections==

===Early history===
Democrat [[Howard Dean]] is credited with being the first politician to use the Internet for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;”Campaign 2.0” Webspace at University of Texas at Austin.  April 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=May 2015}}  Dean served as the Governor of Vermont from 1991 to 2003 and decided to run for president for the 2004 election. Dean is credited with organizing the first campaign website, acting as a virtual headquarters for fundraising and volunteer recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;Hindman, Matthew. “The Real Lessons of Howard Dean: Reflections on the First Digital Campaign.” Perspectives on Politics, 2005, p.121-128.&lt;/ref&gt; Dean’s website had a number of online metrics of success including the hits on his homepage, weblogs, campaign sign-ups, house parties and meet ups.&lt;ref&gt;Rospars, Joe. “How Howard Dean’s Scream Helped Obama Land The Presidency.” Time Magazine. July 1, 2014. http://time.com/2946448/howard-dean-scream-obama-president/&lt;/ref&gt; Dean’s supporters hosted house parties and invited individuals to learn about Dean’s campaign. Dean also encouraged use of the website [[Meetup (website)|Meetup]] for his upstart presidential campaign in 2002, making it easy for people "with a common interest to find each other and arrange to meet, face to face".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Individuals would attend face-to-face meetings to learn more about his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Cornfield, Michael. “The Internet and Campaign: A Look Back at the Campaigners”.  Pew Research Center, 2005, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people coming out to Dean's Meetups in 600 location across the country ultimately reached about 143,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; About 75,000 individuals attended these meet-ups and more than 96% of respondents reported that they wished to become actively involved in Dean’s campaign. The engagement in face-to-face local groups "dramatically affected how involved volunteers got with the campaign. The more Meetups people attended, the higher their average donation to the campaign".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/07/tech/web/meetup-2012-campaign-sifry/|title=From Howard Dean to the tea party: The power of Meetup.com|website=CNN|publisher=Cable News Network.|last1=Sifry|first1=Micah|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean won a "digital" [[primary election]] that was held on [[MoveOn.org]] with 44% of the votes. His success in the primary generated positive coverage by the news media. This early victory was important to the momentum of the campaign. Dean’s campaign was also viewed as a success for his ability to raise large amounts of money in small increments. In January 2004, his campaign had raised $41 million from supporters mostly online. A total of 318,884 individuals contributed to his campaign, with over 61% of the contributions under $200. Less than 1% of individuals gave $2,000, which was the federal limit.&lt;ref name=FEC&gt;{{cite web|title=Contribution Limits for 2003-2004|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/ContributionLimits2003-2004.htm|website=FEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dean’s fundraising behavior was opposite of his rivals. [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] raised $130.8 million in 2003 and 68% of his donations were the maximum donation limit.&lt;ref&gt;Justice, Glen. “Campaign Fund-Raising; Financial Firms are Bush’s Biggest Donors, Study Reports.”The New York Times.  January 9, 2004. https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/09/us/2004-campaign-fund-raising-financial-firms-are-bush-s-biggest-donors-study.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political Origins of Facebook===
[[Mark Zuckerberg]] served as a field organizer for Democrat [[John Kerry]] in the 2004 presidential election.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Slotnick, Allison. “Friend the President”.  2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zuckerberg was responsible for [[Get out the vote]] and mobilization efforts.  Facebook was launched the same year. The [[Facebook Platform]] relies on group formation and constant communication, both of which are goals for any political campaign.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
[[Chris Hughes]], a founding member and developer at Facebook, left the company to work as an advisor for President Barack Obama. While working at Facebook, Hughes designed a Facebook profile for the then presidential candidate. Following his departure, Hughes worked on Obama’s Facebook page and utilized his knowledge of [[content management]] and new developments to outpace other candidates in relation to their online presence.&lt;ref&gt;McGirt, Ellen. “How Chris Hughes helped launch Facebook and the Barack Obama Campaign.” Fast Company Magazine. April 2009. http://www.fastcompany.com/1207594/how-chris-hughes-helped-launch-facebook-and-barack-obama-campaign&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes created the website MyBarak0bama.com which had a similar layout and concept as Facebook.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== 2008 Presidential Election ===
The 2008 presidential election was the first election in which candidates utilized the Internet and social media as a tool for their campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, David. “How Obama Tapped Into Social Networks’ Power.” New York Times. November 9, 2008. https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/business/media/10carr.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; Then President-elect Barack Obama was the first to use the Internet to organize supporters, advertise, and communicate with individuals in a way that had been impossible in previous elections.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Miller, Claire Cain. “How Obama’s Internet Campaign Changed Politics.” New York Times. November 7, 2008. http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/how-obamas-internet-campaign-changed-politics/&lt;/ref&gt; Obama utilized sites like [[YouTube]] to advertise through videos. The videos posted on YouTube by Obama’s were viewed for 14.5 million hours.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, Jessica. “The YouTube Election.” Newsweek. November 9, 2008. http://www.newsweek.com/youtube-election-85069&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 Presidential Election===
By the 2012 election more candidates were utilizing a wider array of social media platforms.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Fouhy, Beth. “Elections 2012: The Social Network, Presidential Campaign Edition.” Huffington Post. April 17, 2011 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/17/elections-2012-social-media_n_850172.html&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians were now on social networking sites like [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]] and other new social media tools and [[mobile apps]]. Some of the candidates used social media sites to announce their candidacy. [[Barack Obama]] emailed a video to 13 million when he announced his intention to run for re-election and [[Mitt Romney]]  sent out a [[Tweet (Twitter)|tweet]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Other candidates posted on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to announce their candidacy.

There is a clear difference between the Obama and Romney campaign's presence on social media throughout the 2012 campaign. In October 2012, President Obama had over 20 million followers on [[Twitter]] and Romney had 1.2 million. On [[Facebook]] Obama had over 29 million likes on his page and Romney had 7.9 million. On [[Instagram]] Obama had 1.4 million followers and Romney had 38,000 followers. President Obama had higher followers on all of his other social media accounts including [[Spotify]] [[Pinterest]] and [[YouTube]],&lt;ref&gt;Wortham, Jenna. “The Presidential Campaign on Social Media.” The New York Times. October 8, 2012. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/08/technology/campaign-social-media.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; though research suggests merely following Obama or Romney on social media sites such as Facebook may have had little influence on voter behaviors.&lt;ref name="Pennington2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pennington|first1=Natalie|last2=Winfrey|first2=Kelly| last3=Warner|first3=Benjamin|last4=Kearney|first4=Michael|title=Liking Obama and Romney (on Facebook): An experimental evaluation of political engagement and efficacy during the 2012 general election|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=44|year=2015|pages=279–283|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.11.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama also utilized his social media accounts more than any other candidate online.&lt;ref&gt;“How the Presidential Candidates Use the Web and Social Media: Obama Leads but Neither Candidate Engages in Much Dialogue with Voters.” Pew Research Center Journalism &amp; Media. August 15, 2012 http:// www.journalism.org/2012/08/15/how-presidential-candidates-use-web-and-social-media/&lt;/ref&gt; He actively posted more on Twitter, YouTube and on his personal website [[blog]].

President Obama’s campaign thrived on online donations in both 2008 and 2012. In 2008 3.95 million people donated to president Obama’s campaign.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; That number reached 4.4 million people during his 2012 campaign. The total online donation also rose from $500 million in 2008 to $690 million in 2012.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===2016 Presidential campaign===
{{main|Social media in the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign}}

===Limitations and constraints===
[[Social media]] has been used in political campaigns ranging from small local elections to larger-scale presidential elections. According to [[Wael Ghonim]], social media can reinforce pre-existing beliefs rather than promote new ones. Social media, while a great source of gathering volunteers and money, serves the main purpose of affirming political beliefs and strengthening a political base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another limitation of the way social media is used in political campaigns is that politicians cannot control the conversation. According to a study by Miguel del Fresno García, Alan J. Daly, and Sagrario Segado Sánchez-Cabezudo, regular friends and followers hold high levels of influence on social media, instead of blogs and campaign pages. Users with the most influence over social media fall into three different categories: users who disseminate knowledge, those who engage other people, and those who lead conversations. These three types of users are the ones who others tend to follow and listen to through social media. Therefore, for political campaigns to truly reach as many people as possible, political groups first need to get those three users talking about their campaigns on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

While "critics [may] worry that governance by social media will cheapen the power of the presidency by substituting hashtag activism for serious policymaking," President Obama's Administration has been credited with successfully "[leveraging] the opportunities of the digital age to maximum political advantage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2015/05/26/heres-how-the-first-president-of-the-social-media-age-has-chosen-to-connect-with-americans/|title=Here's how the first president of the social media age has chosen to connect with Americans|website=The Washington Post|publisher=WP Company LLC|last1=Eilperin|first1=Juliet|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandals==
Scandals have been a part of the American political system since its inception (see [[List of federal political scandals in the United States]]). [[Political scandals]] are events that capture a lot of attention and eventually disappear over and are the source of intense public communication. The media has subsequently played an important role in both the breaking of these stories and the coverage they receive. In recent decades there have been an increased number of scandals relating to the Internet and social media.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Arsenault, Amelia. “Scandal Politics in the New Media Environment” Analytical Note: Scandal Politics Review. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The first and most notable political scandal related to social media has been the demise of Congressman [[Anthony Weiner]] in 2011. Weiner, a Democrat from New York, sent a link of a suggestive photograph to a woman on his public Twitter account. The tweet and picture were then sent to [[Andrew Breitbart]] , a conservative blogger, who posted them to his website before Weiner had a chance to take the tweet down.&lt;ref&gt;Altman, Alex. “Weinergate: Anatomy of Social Media Scandal” Time.  May 31, 2011. http://swampland.time.com/2011/05/31/weinergate-anatomy-of-a-social-media-scandal/&lt;/ref&gt; Within days the Anthony Weiner incident became national news. The scandal, nicknamed [[Weinergate]],  is widely considered to be the first political sex scandal to come about as a result of social media.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, William. “Weinergate’s Lasting Impact: The First Big Social Media Political Sex Scandal.” Huffington Post. June 7, 2011. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-bradley/weinergates-lasting-impac_b_872585.html
&lt;/ref&gt;

Other political scandals have emerged as a result of social media. [[Joe Miller (Alaska politician)|Joe Miller]] a Senate candidate from Alaska tweeted about decorating his office prior to any announcement that he had won the race. Miller deleted the tweets, but not before a blogger was able to screen shot them. Miller eventually lost the election.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Bosker, Bianca. “The Most Embarrassing Politician Twitter Scandals.” The Huffington Post. August 3, 2011. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/03/politicians-top-twitter-s_n_870967.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meg Whitman]] a Republican candidate in California was embarrassed following a tweet sent out by her press secretary that included a YouTube video of a cross-dressed musician. Whitman lost the election to [[Jerry Brown]].&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; [[Pete Hoekstra]], a Michigan Congressman, got into trouble after tweeting throughout a trip to [[Iraq]], in which he breached security by posting confidential details about the visit.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; There is a changing nature of political scandals that has resulted from the increased use of social media and the Internet. Politicians are increasingly more vulnerable online as the separation between public and private life has quickly diminished in the increasingly more connected world.&lt;ref&gt;Lunt and Livingstone. Media and Communications Regulation &amp; The Public Interest. Sage Publication. April 4, 2011 http://www.uk.sagepub.com/upm-data/45145_Lunt_and_Livingstone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
Political scandals are shifting from illegal or corrupt activities towards personal missteps no longer about illegal or corrupt activities.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

on October 26, 2018 social network Facebook announced that it has deleted 82 accounts created in [[Iran]] that included posts advocating harsh issues such as race, immigration, and U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], . . ..  just before U.S. congressional elections on November 6.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.radiofarda.com/a/facebook-deletes-iran-linked-accounts-followed-by-1-million-us-britain-political-divisive-sow-discord/29566728.html Facebook Deletes Iran-Linked Accounts Followed By 1 Million In U.S., Britain]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Mars Generation was founded in 2015 by 18-year-old [[Abigail Harrison]], popularly known as "Astronaut Abby" and has the support of high-level advisory board members which includes astronauts, engineers and scientists as well as [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]], [[education]] and [[business]] professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/30544-astronaut-abby-launches-mars-generation.html|title=Launching 'The Mars Generation': Teen on Mission to Get People to Mars|work=Space.com|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2017/03/17/meet-abby-harrison-the-college-sophomore-headed-for-mars/|title=Meet Abby Harrison, the college sophomore headed for Mars|date=2017-03-17|website=USA TODAY College|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrison started [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] and space advocacy work at the age of 13 by initially setting up a [[Twitter]] account under her childhood nickname "Astronaut Abby."  She used her @AstronautAbby&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AstronautAbby|title=Abigail Harrison (@AstronautAbby) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter account to connect with [[NASA]] employees to try and procure a quote for her National History Day project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/astronaut-abby-hearts-nasa.html|title=NASA – Astronaut Abby Hearts NASA|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=Flint Wild : MSFC, Shelley Canright : HQ, Diedra Williams : MSFC, Cindy McArthur : JSC, Rachel Kraft : JSC, Ann Marie Trotta : HQ, Nicole Harrison : POC, Abby Harrison : POC|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her account biography stated that she was aspiring to be an astronaut and had a goal to be the first person to set foot on Mars. After she received the NASA quote, she began to share her journey to Mars which included tweets about space events, school and her personal life with the goal of not only exciting people about mars exploration but creating advocates for human space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/astronaut-abby-hearts-nasa.html|title=NASA – Astronaut Abby Hearts NASA|website=www.nasa.gov|language=en|others=Flint Wild : MSFC, Shelley Canright : HQ, Diedra Williams : MSFC, Cindy McArthur : JSC, Rachel Kraft : JSC, Ann Marie Trotta : HQ, Nicole Harrison : POC, Abby Harrison : POC|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, at 15-years old, Harrison partnered with her mentor, Astronaut [[Luca Parmitano]] as his [[Earth]] Liaison and shared his experience living in space on the [[International Space Station]] during [[Expedition 36]] and [[Expedition 37]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.universetoday.com/101824/why-an-astronaut-asked-15-year-old-abby-to-help-get-the-word-out/#more-101824|title=Why An Astronaut Asked 15 Year Old Abby to Help Get The Word Out – Universe Today|date=2013-04-30|work=Universe Today|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harrison setup an international outreach program consisting of classroom web chats, an [[email]] [[pen pal]] program, [[classroom]] visits, blogging on AstronautAbby.com, writing for other publications, speaking at events, and sharing on [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://explorecuriocity.org/Explore/ArticleId/2326/astronaut-abby-2326.aspx|title=CurioCity – CurioCité {{!}} Astronaut Abby|website=explorecuriocity.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially called the Soyuz Adventure, after Astronaut Parmitano returned to [[Earth]], it was renamed "The Future of Space" and Harrison continued to run the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/astronaut-abby-is-crowdfunding-her-way-to-outer-space/208184441/|title='Astronaut Abby' is crowdfunding her way to outer space|work=Star Tribune|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://skepticlab.com/episode/029-mission-to-mars-with-astronaut-abby/|title=#029 – Mission to Mars with Astronaut Abby – SkepticLab|work=SkepticLab|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program was the basis for the development of The Mars Generation nonprofit in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2017/03/17/meet-abby-harrison-the-college-sophomore-headed-for-mars/|title=Meet Abby Harrison, the college sophomore headed for Mars|date=2017-03-17|website=USA TODAY College|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sea.pcmag.com/news/9272/mars-and-the-public-imagination|title=Mars and the Public Imagination|date=2016-01-05|work=PCMag Asia|access-date=2017-08-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''(Documents Relating to) The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire''''' is a 1983 science fiction novel by [[Doris Lessing]]. It is the fifth book in her five-book ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dorislessing.org/canopusin.html |title=Canopus in Argos: Archives |work=dorislessing.org |accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comprises a set of documents that describe the final days of the Volyen Empire, located at the edge of our galaxy and under the influence of three other galactic empires, the benevolent [[Canopus]], the tyrannical [[Sirius]], and the malicious Shammat of Puttiora. It was first published in the United States in March 1983 by [[Alfred A. Knopf]], and in the United Kingdom in May 1983 by [[Jonathan Cape]].

''The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire'' is a social satire written in the tradition of [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[George Orwell]],&lt;ref name=Kakutani&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE4DF1539F937A25750C0A965948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Books of the Times: The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Michiko |last=Kakutani |authorlink=Michiko Kakutani |accessdate=16 December 2008 | date=14 March 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focuses on the debasement of language in [[rhetoric|political rhetoric]].&lt;ref name=Rothstein&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04EED61039F930A35757C0A965948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Against Galactic Rhetoric |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Edward  |last=Rothstein |authorlink=Edward Rothstein |accessdate=16 December 2008 | date=3 April 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lessing's [[fictional universe]] it is propaganda that keeps the fragile empires afloat, and when language becomes too distorted, some of her characters succumb to a condition called "undulant rhetoric" and are placed in a Hospital for Rhetorical Diseases.&lt;ref name=Rothstein/&gt;{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=pp. 11 &amp; 15}}

Because of its focus on characterisation and social/cultural issues, and the de-emphasis of technological details, this book is not strictly science fiction but [[soft science fiction]], or "space fiction" as Lessing calls her ''Canopus in Argos'' series.{{sfn|Lessing|1994a|loc="Some Remarks", p. 8}} While ''The Sentimental Agents'' can be read as a stand-alone book, Lessing does continue with the history of the Sirian Empire, picking up from where she left off in ''[[The Sirian Experiments]]'' (1980), the third book in the ''Canopus'' series.{{sfn|Lessing|1994b}}{{sfn|Lessing|1994c}}

==Reception==
[[Edward Rothstein]] in a review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' describes ''The Sentimental Agents in the Volyen Empire'' as "a satirical romp through rhetoric in a foreign empire", but complains that the tone of the book "wavers uncertainly, mixing farce, cynicism and banal religiosity."&lt;ref name=Rothstein/&gt;

In another New York Times review, [[Michiko Kakutani]] writes that in this book Lessing has "narrowed her cosmic focus to a specific issue, namely the manipulative use of language and words" which, she believes, was handled with "more acerbity and more humour" by [[George Orwell]] in ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949).&lt;ref name=Kakutani/&gt;

==Plot==
The Volyen Empire is a relatively weak interstellar empire situated at the edge of our galaxy.{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=p. 13}} It comprises the planet Volyen, its two moons, Volyenadna and Volyendesta (also referred to as planets), and two neighbouring planets, Maken and Slovin.{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=p. 12}} Intelligent life evolved independently on each of these five "planets", and over time unstable empires formed, where each planet for a period ruled the others. The Volyen Empire is the last of these empires and rules the region with force and repression.

Although this system is at the edge of the Canopean Empire's sphere of influence, Canopus sends agents to the region because Volyen's colonisation of Maken and Slovin provoked the Sirian Empire who had earmarked these planets for "possible expansion". In addition, Shammat, Canopus's enemy, had established a presence in the region.

Disillusioned and oppressed, the citizens of Volyen and its colonies start speaking out against the Volyen government. Revolutionary groups form and counter the Empire's rhetoric with rhetoric of their own. Krolgul of Shammat, buoyed by the turmoil, encourages anti-government behaviour. Klorathy, a senior Canopean Colonial administrator, is sent to Volyen to observe the unfolding events, and to monitor Incent, one of his agents who has been caught up in the sentiment of the revolutionary rhetoric. Incent has also fallen prey to Krolgul's propaganda and is withdrawn from the field by Klorathy and placed in a Hospital for Rhetorical Diseases on Volyendesta.{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=p. 15}}

Sirius is now threatening to invade the region, and this is welcomed by the downtrodden in the Volyen Empire because they are sure that Sirius will set them free. Many citizens became Sirian agents and provide Sirius with information and support. But the Sirian Empire is itself in turmoil. A conflict on Sirius split the governing oligarchy into the Questioners, led by the Five who want Sirius's expansion program halted, and the Conservers, who believe Sirius should continue colonising other planets.{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=p.14}} The Five were defeated and Sirius resumed its expansion, but this time with an uncontrolled brutality that turned the Sirian Empire into a tyranny. When the Sirian agents learn about Sirius's tyranny, their loyalties are divided between Sirius and Volyen, and they become known as "sentimental agents".{{sfn|Lessing|1994c|loc=p.190}}

Sirius invades the Volyen Empire with troops from nearby Sirian occupied planets. The troops, themselves colonial subjects of the now declining Sirian Empire, were told that Volyen is poor and deprived and needs Sirius's help. But when they land they discover that the Volyens are better off than they are, and return home and declare their own planets independent from Sirius. Volyenadna and Volyendesta, with Klorathy's help, become self-sustaining and declare ''their'' independence from the crumbling Volyen Empire.

The change of circumstances in the region weakens Krolgul and his influence, and he returns to Shammat. Incent, now "recovered" from his illness, decides that he is going to help Krolgul. Klorathy, still Incent's custodian, follows him to Shammat.

== VDC Managed Project ==

"Virtual Design and Construction BIMs are [[Virtuality|virtual]] because they show [[Computer-based assessment|computer-based]] descriptions of the project. The BIM project model emphasizes those aspects of the project that can be designed and managed, i.e., the ''[[Product (business)|product]]'' (typically a [[building]] or [[Factory|plant]] [and infrastructure]), the ''[[organization]]'' that will define, [[design]], [[construction|construct]] and [[operate]] it, and the ''[[Business process|process]]'' that the organization teams will follow, or POP {{Definition needed|date=March 2018}}. These models are [[logically]] integrated in the sense that they all can access [[Concurrent data structure|shared data]], and if a user highlights or changes an aspect of one, the integrated models can highlight or change the dependent aspects of related models. The models are [[multi-disciplinary]] in the sense that they represent the [[Architect]], [[Engineering]], [[Construction]] (AEC) and [[Owner]] of the project, as well as relevant sub-disciplines. The models are [[Performance test (assessment)|performance models]] in the sense that they predict some aspects of project performance, track many that are relevant, and can show predicted and measured performance in relationship to stated project performance objectives. Some companies now practice the first steps of BIM modeling, and they consistently find that they improve business performance by doing so."&lt;ref&gt;John Kunz &amp; Martin Fischer  "Virtual Design and Construction: Themes, Case Studies and Implementation Suggestions" Stanford University CIFE Working Paper # 97, October 2009. [http://cife.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/WP097_0.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Companies are also now considering developing BIMs in various levels of detail, since depending on the application of BIM, more or less detail is needed, and there is varying modeling effort associated with generating building information models at different levels of detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.autcon.2010.11.027 |title=Analysis of modeling effort and impact of different levels of detail in building information models |year=2011 |last1=Leite |first1=F |last2=Akcamete |first2=A |last3=Akinci |first3=B |last4=Atasoy |first4=G |last5=Kiziltas |first5=S |journal=Automation in Construction |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=601–609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodologies Underpinning VDC ==
Advancements in construction engineering began with the ten volumes on architecture completed by [[Vitruvius]], a 1 century B.C. Roman. Vitruvi laid the foundation for the study of construction.

A principle of construction is the use of an [[Applied ontology]] based in an [[Upper ontology (information science)|Upper ontology]]. In practice these ontologies take on the form of breakdown structures such as the [[Work breakdown structure]]. Usually these breakdown structures form [[Metadata]] to represent a construction activity. In practice, this requires a [[Semantic integration]] approach to construction data so to capture the project status.

The research that formed VDC is based in [[Scientific evidence]]. This was a departure from earlier construction engineering that focused on studies of best practices. This required formulating a [[Hypothesis]] and then testing to validate. A range of methodologies have proven useful in construction engineering research, both [[Qualitative research]] and [[Quantitative research]]. Because construction is difficult to replicate in a controlled setting, the [[Case-based reasoning]] || [[Case study]] and [[Action research]] methodologies prevail. These methodologies have different [[Power of a method]], where the case study is often broad and the action research focused.

A core concept of VDC is the [[Spacetime]]. There are four dimensions, these three space dimensions and then a fourth: time. There are additional dimensions of cost and quality, but the core are these four. These four dimensions in design were first understood by Vitruvi as the importance of perspective and time. Prior to the use of computing, the focus was on the fourth dimension time. In practice, this is the [[Critical path method]]. With advances in computing, the representation of the three dimensions of space has increased. The merging of space and the above discussed ontology formed the  [[Information model]], in the construction engineering field, known as [[Building Information Modeling]]. The combination of space and time in practice is shown by the [[Linear scheduling method]] and in close relation the 4D model.

Computing brought about the advent of the need to align with a software developer. Previously, pencil and paper was forgiving on the mixing of methods from different schools of thought. Software is not as forgiving and to mix software requires this as a goal. This forms the field of [[Interoperability]] research. The practical application is demonstrated by the [[Industry Foundation Classes]].

Today, the most compelling advances in VDC are in computer vision ([[List of computer vision topics]]) and the architecture of transmission (AoT), an object-oriented project lifecycle management process, which acts as a counterpoint to commissioned IoT technologies. [http://cife.stanford.edu/]

An important application of VDC is in the workzone. This is where the construction activities reside, and the workforce is a core component. To create an educated workforce with the technical knowhow to use the technology tools now available, VDC includes the development of advanced [[Vocational education]] topics.

[[File:DNA Helix and Tree of Life stain glass window.JPG|thumbnail|right|Commemorative stain window located in the Sulston building of the Wellcome Sanger Institute, to mark the opening of the Genome Campus.]]
In 1993 the then 17 Sanger Centre staff moved into temporary laboratory space at Hinxton Hall&lt;ref name="sanger1"/&gt; in [[Cambridgeshire]]. This {{convert|55|acre|m2|adj=on}} site was to become the Wellcome Genome Campus, which has a growing population of around 1300 staff, approximately 900 of whom work at the Sanger Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk/careers/|title=Wellcome Sanger Institute - Work and study|publisher=Wellcome Sanger Institute|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Genome Campus also includes the Wellcome Trust Conference Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtconference.org/|title=Welcome to the Wellcome Genome Campus Conference Centre|author=|date=|website=Wellcome Genome Campus Conference Centre|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]]. A major extension of the campus was officially opened in 2005;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Info/Press/2005/051014.shtml|title=Wellcome Trust Genome Campus Extension Opened: Visit by Her Royal Highness, The Princess Royal|publisher=Wellcome Sanger Institute|accessdate=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the buildings accommodate new laboratories, a [[data centre]] and staff amenities.&lt;ref name=datacentre&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Doctorow | first1 = C. | authorlink1 = Cory Doctorow| title = Big data: Welcome to the petacentre | doi = 10.1038/455016a | journal = Nature | volume = 455 | issue = 7209 | pages = 16–21 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18769411| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing the name of the centre, Sanger (still alive when the centre was opened) told [[John Sulston]], the founding director, that the centre "had better be good."

{{update|section|date=April 2015}}
[[File:Hinxton hall.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Morgan Building (right), part of the Sanger Institute]]
Since 2000, the Sanger Institute has built on its [[sequencing]] skills to develop new programmes in postgenomic [[biology]] - understanding the messages in [[genes]]. As of 2016 (when the Institute's latest 5-year funding plan began), the Institute engages in several areas of research:

=== [[Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation Programme]] ===
Provides leadership in data aggregation and informatics innovation, develops high-throughput cellular models of cancer for genome-wide functional screens and drug testing, and explores somatic mutation's role in clonal evolution, ageing and development.

=== [[Cellular Genetics Programme]] ===
Explores human gene function by studying the impact of genome variation on cell biology. Large-scale systematic screens are used to discover the impact of naturally occurring and engineered genome mutations in human induced pluripotent cells (hIPSCs), their differentiated derivatives and other cell types. It is one of the founder programmes driving the creation and organisation of the international [[Human Cell Atlas]] initiative.

===[[Human Genetics Programme]]===
The Institute's research in [[human genetics]] focuses on the characterisation of [[human genetic variation]] in health and disease. Aside from the Institute's contribution to the [[Human Genome Project]], researchers at the Sanger Institute have made contributions in various research areas relating to disease, population comparative and [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|evolutionary genetics]]. In January 2008, the launch of the [[1000 Genomes Project]], a collaboration with scientists around the globe, signalled an effort to sequence the genomes of 1000 individuals in order to create the "most detailed map of human genetic variation to support disease studies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1000genomes.org/page.php|title=1000 Genomes: A Deep Catalog of Human Genetic Variation|publisher=1000 Genomes Project|accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data from the pilot projects was made freely available in public databases in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/press/2010/100621.html|title=1000 Genomes Project releases data from pilot projects on path to providing database for 2,500 human genomes|publisher=Wellcome Sanger Institute|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Sanger Institute announced its participation in the UK10K project,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The Programme applies genomics to population-scale studies to identify the causal variants and pathways involved in human disease and their effects on cell biology. It also models developmental disorders to explore which physical aspects might be reversible.

===Infection Genomics Programme===
Investigates the common underpinning mechanisms of evolution, infection and resistance to therapy into bolster understanding of [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es and [[parasitism|parasites.]] It also explores the effects of genome variation on the biology of [[host (biology)|host]]-[[pathogen]] interactions, in particular host response to infection and the role of microiotia in health and disease. All the genomes after sequencing are made available at the web-based onsite-maintained database, GeneDB.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== Malaria Programme ===
Integrates genomic, genetic and proteomic approaches to develop and enhance high-throughput tools and technologies to study specific biological problems relevant for malaria control and to understand the fundamental science of the human host, the mosquito vector and the ''Plasmodium'' pathogen.

=== Facilities/Expertise ===
All of this research is underpinned by expertise in a number of key areas:

===Bioinformatics===
The Sanger Institute's bioinformatics teams have developed [[Information Technology|IT]] systems for sequencing and postgenomic research. The Institute houses genome resources, RNA, protein and other [[family (biology)|family]] resources and functional annotation databases and resources. Researchers worldwide are able to use these resources to make [[inferences]] of genomic knowledge through computational analysis and integration of data.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Model organisms===
[[Laboratory mouse|Mouse]] and [[Zebrafish#In scientific research|zebrafish]] teams at the Sanger Institute enable Sanger researchers to explore the genome sequences of these [[model organisms]] to understand basic biological mechanisms, and gene function in human health and disease. Project supported include the study of development, cancer, hearing and behaviour.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== Experimental biological models ===
{{ad|date=August 2018}}
With the creation of the Sanger Institute-EBI Single Cell Centre and the Cellular Generation and Phenotyping]pipeline, the Institute has developed state-of-the-art human induced pluripotent stem cell, induced pluripotent stem cell, single cell and [[organoid]] facilties to deliver the next generation of biological models.

===Collaborations===
Much of the Sanger Institute's research is carried out in partnership with the wider [[scientific community]]; over 90 percent of the Institute's research papers involve collaborations with other organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Figure based on data for 2008 retrieved from SCOPUS website&lt;/ref&gt; Significant collaborations include:

===Public engagement===
[[File:Sanger Institute outreach DNA bracelets.jpg|thumb|Children at a public outreach event thread bracelets in four colours to spell out a DNA sequence.]]
The Sanger Institute has a programme of [[public engagement]] activity. The programme aims to make complex biomedical research accessible to a range of audiences including school students and their teachers, and local community members.

The Communication and Public Engagement programme aims to "encourage informed discussion about issues relevant to Sanger Institute research"&lt;ref name="Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute" /&gt; and "foster a community of researchers who can engage effectively with different audiences".&lt;ref name="Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Teams/Team104/|title=Team 104: Communication and Public Engagement Programme|publisher=Wellcome Sanger Institute|accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute hosts visits for more than 1,500 students, teachers and community groups per year. Visitors may meet scientific staff, tour the Institute and its facilities, and participate in ethical debates and activities. The programme also offers professional development sessions for teachers of [[GCSE]] and post 16 science through the national network of [[Science Learning Centres]], and by hosting visits for groups interested in updating their knowledge in contemporary genetics. [[Videoconferencing]] into the Sanger Institute is also offered for Science Learning Centres, Science Centres and schools.

The programme maintains a dedicated public website, yourgenome.org,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourgenome.org/|title=yourgenome.org|author=|date=|website=www.yourgenome.org|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is intended to help people understand [[genetics]] and [[genomics]] science and its implications for society. The website includes teaching resources for [[secondary school]] science teachers that have been developed with Institute researchers.

Scientific and public engagement staff also collaborate on and contribute to national projects such as the UK's ''InsideDNA''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidedna.org.uk/content/|title=InsideDNA|author=|date=|website=insidedna.org.uk|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  traveling exhibition and the ''Who am I?'' gallery at [[Science Museum (London)|The Science Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/|title=Home - Science Museum|author=|date=|website=Science Museum|accessdate=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also participate in public events such as the Cambridge Science Festival.

===Graduate training===
The Institute operates two PhD training programmes: a four-year course for basic science graduates, and a three-year course for clinicians. The four-year course requires students to rotate around three different laboratories in order to broaden their scientific horizons before choosing a PhD project. Each student is required to choose at least one experimental and one informatics-based rotation project.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:EBI and Sanger Center, Genome campus, Cambridgeshire.jpg|350px|right|thumb|The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute was established in 1992, funded by the [[Wellcome Trust]] and the UK's [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]. One of the primary goals of the Institute on its creation, was to "play a role in mapping, sequencing and decoding the [[human genome]] and the genomes of other organisms".&lt;ref name="sanger1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/history/history.html|title=Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute - History|publisher=Wellcome Sanger Institute|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanger Institute now hosts several research programmes aiming to elucidate the associations between [[genes]] and [[trait (biology)|biological traits]] - most often disease susceptibilities. The Sanger Institute has, since inception, maintained a policy that "aims to provide rapid access to data sets of use to the research community".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk/legal/|title=Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute - Data conditions|publisher=Wellcome Sanger Institute|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Management ===
[[John E. Sulston]] was the founding Director of the Sanger Institute. Sulston was instrumental in the choice of the Hinxton site for the Institute and remained there as Director until the announcement of the completion of the draft human genome in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genome.gov/10001457|title=International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium Announces "Working Draft" of Human Genome|publisher=National Human Genome Research Institute|accessdate=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulston graduated from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1963 and completed his PhD on the chemical synthesis of DNA in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sulston J, Ferry G|title=The Common Thread: A story of Science, Politics, Ethics, and the Human Genome|year=2002|publisher=The Joseph Henry Press|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He shared the 2002 [[Nobel Prize]] in Physiology or Medicine with [[Robert Horvitz]] and [[Sydney Brenner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2002/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology  or Medicine 2002|publisher=Nobel Prize|accessdate=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; two years after standing down as Director of the Institute.

In 2000, [[Allan Bradley]] left his appointment as Professor at the [[Baylor College of Medicine]], in the USA, to take up the position as Director of the Sanger Institute. Bradley wanted to build on the achievements made by the Sanger Institute in the Human Genome Project by "concentrating on gene function, cancer genomics, and the genomes of model organisms such as the mouse and the zebrafish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genomebiology.com/researchnews/default.asp?arx_id=gb-spotlight-20011106-02 |title=Sanger Institute looks to the future |publisher=Genome Biology |accessdate=2008-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040119195438/http://genomebiology.com/researchnews/default.asp?arx_id=gb-spotlight-20011106-02 |archivedate=January 19, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradley received his BA, MA and PhD in Genetics from the University of Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Teams/faculty/bradley/|title=Professor Allan Bradley|publisher=Wellcome Sanger Institute|archivedate=2015-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407061817/http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/faculty/abradley/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2010, Bradley stepped down from his leadership role to form a [[startup company]], but remains on the faculty of the Institute as Director Emeritus. [[Michael Stratton|Mike Stratton]], who is a leader of the [[Cancer Genome Project]] and the [[International Cancer Genome Consortium]], was appointed Director of the Sanger Institute in May of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanger.ac.uk/about/press/2010/100517.html |title=Professor Mike Stratton appointed new Director|publisher=Wellcome Sanger Institute|accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018 it was reported that an investigation was under way into allegations of bullying of staff and gender discrimination made against senior management of the [[Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute]], including the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/29/wellcome-sanger-institute-bosses-accused-bullying-staff|title=Bosses at leading UK science institute accused of bullying staff|last=Marsh|first=Sarah|last2=Devlin|first2=Hannah|date=2018-08-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The independent investigation, carried out by the barrister Thomas Kibling from [[Matrix Chambers]], concluded in October 2018 and cleared Stratton of any wrongdoing, while listing areas for improvement in the workings of the Sanger Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sanger.ac.uk/news/view/result-independent-investigation-whistleblowing-allegations-released |title=Result of independent investigation into whistleblowing allegations released |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-10-31|website=Sanger Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sanger.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Oct2018/Thomas_Kibling_Investigatory_Report_-_Introduction_and_Executive_Summary.pdf |title=Thomas Kibling's Investigatory Report |author=Thomas Kibling |date=2018-10-31|website=Sanger Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organizational and company spin outs{{Anchor|Congenica}} ===
The company Congenica was spun out of the Institute in the early 2000s to commercialize a clinical genetics analysis and reporting technology developed at the Institute, technology instantiated in Congenica's Sapientia platform.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.clinicalomics.com/articles/congenica-names-david-atkins-as-ceo/1459|title=Congenica Names David Atkins as CEO|last=&lt;!-- no byline --&gt;|first=|date=25 January 2018|work=ClinicalOMICs|access-date=26 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sapienta is used in several large scale genome intrepretation projects, including [[100,000 Genomes Project]] and [[FutureNeuro]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.genomeweb.com/neurological-psychological-disorders/congenica-teams-irelands-futureneuro-pursuit-better-epilepsy|title=Congenica Teams With Ireland's FutureNeuro in Pursuit of Better Epilepsy Diagnosis|last=&lt;!--no byline--&gt;|first=|date=12 February 2018|work=GenomeWeb|access-date=19 September 2018|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Congenica is based at the [[Wellcome Genome Campus|Welcome Genome Campus]], and completed a round of [[Series B financing]] in 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Human Genome Project===
The Sanger Institute was opened in 1993, three years after the inception of the [[Human Genome Project]], and went on to make the largest single contribution to the gold standard sequence of the [[human genome]], published in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Human Genome Sequencing Consortium|title=Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome|journal=Nature|year=2004|volume=431|pages=931–945|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7011/index.html|doi=10.1038/nature03001|pmid=15496913|issue=7011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute was engaged in collaborations to sequence 8 of the 23 human pairs of [[chromosomes]] ([[chromosome 1|1]], [[chromosome 6|6]], [[chromosome 9|9]], [[chromosome 10|10]], [[chromosome 13|13]], [[chromosome 20|20]], [[chromosome 22|22]], and [[X chromosome|X]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pennisi E|title=Reaching Their Goal Early, Sequencing Labs Celebrate|journal=Science|year=2003|volume=300|page=409|url=http://www.scienceonline.org/cgi/content/full/300/5618/409|doi=10.1126/science.300.5618.409|pmid=12702850|issue=5618}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the publishing of the human genome, research carried out at the Institute has developed beyond sequencing of organisms into various biomedical research areas, including studies into diseases such as cancer, malaria and diabetes.

In 1998, a statute enacted by the legislature of the State of Alabama amended the obscenity provisions of the Alabama Code to make the distribution of certain defined sexual devices a criminal offense. Vendors and users of such devices filed a constitutional challenge to the statute in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama]] against [[William H. Pryor, Jr.]], in his official capacity as the Attorney General of the State of Alabama.&lt;ref name="NDAla"&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Williams v. Pryor |vol=41 |reporter=F. Supp. 2d |opinion=1257 |pinpoint= |court=N.D. Ala. |date=1999 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/41/1257/2411577/ |accessdate=2017-11-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district court declined to hold the statute violated any constitutional right but determined the statute was unconstitutional because it lacked a rational basis.&lt;ref name="NDAla"/&gt; The State appealed to the [[Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals]], which reversed the lower court ruling on October 12, 2000.&lt;ref name="11thCir1"/&gt;

==Background==

After the 1998 amendment, the Alabama Code obscenity provisions provide the following:
''It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly distribute, possess with intent to distribute, or offer or agree to distribute any obscene material or any device designed or marketed as useful primarily for the stimulation of human genital organs for any thing of pecuniary value.''

A first violation is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum fine of $10,000 and up to one year of jail or hard labor; a subsequent violation is a class C felony.  The State conceded the statute's proscription of the distribution of sexual devices in Alabama does not apply to devices acquired as gifts or by purchases in another state. The statute also does not restrict possession or use of a sexual device by an individual, but only the commercial distribution of the devices. 
After considering Supreme Court precedent, the District Court determined the statute does not implicate previously recognized fundamental constitutional rights. The court also declined to extend those rights to provide a fundamental right to the use of sexual devices  The district court next reviewed the statute under rational basis scrutiny and concluded the statute lacked a rational basis. The court accordingly held the statute unconstitutional and issued a permanent injunction against its enforcement.&lt;ref name="NDAla"/&gt;

==Eleventh Circuit ruling==
The Circuit Court explained that whether a statute is constitutional is determined in large part by the level of scrutiny applied by the courts. Statutes that infringe fundamental rights, or that make distinctions based upon suspect classifications such as race or national origin, are subject to [[strict scrutiny]], which requires that the statute be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.  Most statutes reviewed under the very stringent strict scrutiny standard are found to be unconstitutional.  Quoting ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', the Circuit Court stated that "if a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect class, we will uphold the [law] so long as it bears a rational relation to some legitimate end."&lt;ref&gt;''Williams v. Pryor'', 240 F.3d at 948, quoting {{ussc|name=Romer v. Evans|link=|volume=517|page=620|pin=632|year=1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Court, almost every statute subject to the very deferential [[Rational basis review|rational basis]] scrutiny standard is found to be constitutional.

The Circuit Court concluded that the district court erred in determining the Alabama statute lacks a rational basis. It found that the State's interest in public morality is a legitimate interest rationally served by the statute, and that the crafting and safeguarding of public morality has long been an established part of the States' plenary police power to legislate and indisputably is a legitimate government interest under rational basis scrutiny.

The Court rejected plaintiffs argument that the statute is constitutionally irrational because it is contrary to a wide spectrum of public and professional opinions which recognize numerous legitimate and beneficial uses of sexual devices, especially the necessity of sexual devices for some persons to achieve medical or emotional health. The Court said that however misguided the legislature of Alabama may have been in enacting the statute challenged in this case, the statute is not constitutionally irrational under rational basis scrutiny because it is rationally related to the State's legitimate power to protect its view of public morality. "The Constitution presumes that ... improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process and that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no matter how unwisely we may think a political branch has acted."&lt;ref&gt;''Williams v. Pryor'', 240 F.3d at 952, quoting {{ussc|name=Vance v. Bradley|link=|volume=440|page=93|pin=97|year=1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court remanded the [[as-applied challenge]]s for consideration by the district court because the record and stipulations were too narrow to permit the Court to decide whether or to what extent the Alabama statute infringes a fundamental right to sexual privacy of the specific plaintiffs in this case.

==Subsequent challenges==
In December 2003 the Supreme court ruled in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' which overturned the previous decision of ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' In light of this the [[ACLU]] again challenged the decision before the 11th Circuit in February 2007. The 11th circuit ruled that even though ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' had been overruled that in doing so the Supreme Court had

&lt;blockquote&gt;"declined the invitation" to recognize a fundamental right to sexual privacy, which would have compelled us to employ strict scrutiny in assessing the constitutionality of the challenged statute ... Thus, because there is no fundamental right at issue, we apply rational basis scrutiny to the challenged statute.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; ... Accordingly, we find that public morality survives as a rational basis for legislation even after ''Lawrence'', and we find that in this case the State's interest in the preservation of public morality remains a rational basis for the challenged statute. By upholding the statute, we do not endorse the judgment of the Alabama legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Williams v. Morgan |vol=478 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1316 |pinpoint=1320-23 |court=11th Cir. |date=2007 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/478/1316/473287/ |accessdate=2017-11-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[Reliable Consultants Inc. v. Earle]],'' on February 12, 2008, the 5th Circuit overturned the Texas ban on the sale of sex toys using the similar facts that failed in the above appeal. It held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as in ''Lawrence'', the State here wants to use its laws to enforce a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct. The case is not about public sex. It is not about controlling commerce in sex. It is about controlling what people do in the privacy of their own homes because the State is morally opposed to a certain type of consensual private intimate conduct. This is an insufficient justification for the statute after ''Lawrence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Reliable Consultants Inc. v. Earle |vol=517 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=738 |pinpoint=746 |court=5th Cir. |date=2008 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/20081255517f3d73811253 |accessdate=2017-11-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[This That and the Other Gift &amp; Tobacco, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga.]],'' the 11th Circuit struck down on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds a Georgia law that banned advertising obscene material, including sex toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=This That and the Other Gift &amp; Tobacco, Inc. v. Cobb County, Ga. |vol=439  |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1275 |pinpoint= |court=11th Cir. |date=2006 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/439/1275/549867/ |accessdate=2017-11-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''wrong''' (from [[Old English]] ''wrang ''– ''crooked'')&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|chapter=crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an act that is illegal or [[immoral]].&lt;ref name="oxdic"&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of Law|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198607563|author=Elizabeth A. Martin|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Legal wrongs''' are usually quite clearly defined in the [[law]] of a [[State (polity)|state]] and/or [[jurisdiction]]. They can be divided into [[civil wrong]]s and [[crime]]s (or ''criminal offences'') in [[Common law (legal system)|common law]] countries,&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt; while [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries tend to have some additional categories, such as [[contraventions]].

'''[[Morality|Moral]] wrong''' is an underlying concept for legal wrong. Some moral wrongs are punishable by law, for example, [[rape]] or [[murder]].&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt; Other moral wrongs have nothing to do with law. On the other hand, some legal wrongs, such as parking  offences, could hardly be classified as moral wrongs.&lt;ref name="oxdic" /&gt;

==Legal wrong==
In law, a wrong can be a legal [[injury]], which is any damage resulting from a violation of a [[legal right]]. A legal wrong can also imply the state of being contrary to the principles of justice or law. It means that something is contrary to conscience or morality and results in treating others unjustly. If the loss caused by a wrong is minor enough, there is no compensation, which principle is known as ''[[De minimis|de minimis non curat lex]]''. Otherwise, damages apply.

The law of England recognised the concept of a "wrong" before it recognised the distinction between [[civil wrong]]s (governed by [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]]) and [[crime]]s (defined by [[criminal law]]), which distinction was developed during the thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]], [[A First Book of English Law]], Sweet and Maxwell, 4th ed., 1960, pp. 207, 208, 213&lt;/ref&gt;
