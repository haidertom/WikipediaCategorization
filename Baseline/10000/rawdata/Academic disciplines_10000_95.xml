'''''A Collation of Four Important Manuscripts of the Gospels''''', full title: ''A Collation of Four Important Manuscripts of the Gospels: With a View to Prove Their Common Origin, and to Restore the Text of Their Archetype''. The book was published in 1877 by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott on behalf of his deceased colleague William Hugh Ferrar.

[[William Hugh Ferrar]] (1826–1871) before his death collated four [[Minuscule Greek|minuscules]] (Greek handwritten [[Lower case|cursive]] texts) to demonstrate that they shared a common provenance. The four collated minuscules are: [[Minuscule 13|13]], [[Minuscule 69|69]], [[Minuscule 124|124]], [[Minuscule 346|346]] (known as [[Family 13]] or ''Ferrar Family''). Ferrar intended to establish that these four codices are derived from a common archetype, and to exhibit as nearly as possible the actual text of this [[archetype]] of these four minuscules, a text, therefore, more ancient and authoritative than of any of these manuscripts separately.

The book was published in 1877 by [[Thomas Kingsmill Abbott|T. K. Abbott]] on behalf of William Hugh Ferrar, who had died six years previous.

The '''Abel Assessment for Sexual Interest''' (also '''Abel Assessment for Interest in Paraphilias''') is an assessment test that purports to measure sexual interest in various subjects – and especially to measure a tendency toward [[pedophilia]].&lt;ref name=Chammah&gt;{{cite web |first=Maurice |last=Chammah |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/the-sex-offender-test/397850/ |title=The Sex-Offender Test: How a computerized assessment can help determine the fate of men who've been accused of sexually abusing children |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=2015-07-09 |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test was created by [[Gene Abel|Dr. Gene G. Abel]] in 1995, and has been subsequently revised several times. It has been used as evidence in [[Northern America]] when prosecuting [[sex offender]]s, although its reliability has since been disputed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Statistical adequacy of the Abel Assessment for Interest in Paraphilias.|date=2014-01-24 |pmid=10497779 | volume=11 |journal=Sex Abuse |pages=195–205}} (abstract only; membership required for access to full text).&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been declared inadmissible in court in various [[jurisdiction]]s.

The Abel Assessment is controversial, because its results, although subjective, are presented as cut and dried. Some experts question its [[methodology]].&lt;ref&gt;United States of America v. Guy Randy White Horse (U.S. District Court, South Dakota Western Division 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Gillan MacLean (1998). "Testing the Reliability and Validity of the Abel Assessment". Department of Counseling and Special Education (Brigham Young University).&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the test's uncertainty, [[mental health]] professionals have used the Abel Assessment to civilly commit sex offenders.

==History and testing method==
Dr. Gene Abel began researching sexual interest in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drgeneabel.com/install/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Abel-Assessment.pdf |title=The Leader in Science-based Tests for Sex Specific Evaluation &amp; Treatment |publisher=Drgeneabel.com |accessdate=2014-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214455/http://www.drgeneabel.com/install/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Abel-Assessment.pdf |archivedate=February 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that he previously used the [[penile plethysmograph]] before developing the Abel Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulstuckle.com/InformationCenter/ChildAbuse/ThePenilePlethysmograph.aspx |title=The Penile Plethysmograph in Sexual Assault Cases |publisher=Stuckle and Associates, PLLC |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Abel Assessment, the subject is shown a series of slides in two separate processes. The first measures each slide's viewing time, determining the subject's reaction vis-à-vis the mean reaction. If the subject's viewing time is longer than the mean, it is said that he has a sexual interest in the image shown. For example, if the subject looks at children in bathing suits for longer than average, the Abel Assessment shows him as having an interest in children.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

During the second process, the individual must rate the images from 1 to 7, with 1 being revolting and 7 being sexually exciting.

==Questions of validity==

The validity of the Abel Assessment has been questioned; it has struggled at times to pass the [[Daubert standard]] for admissibility in federal and [[State court (United States)|state court]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.atriumexperts.com/blogs/view/psychology-does-the-abel-assessment-of-sexual-interest-meet-the-daubert-criteria-for-evidence | title = PSYCHOLOGY: Does the Abel Assessment of Sexual Interest Meet the Daubert Criteria for Evidence? | accessdate = 2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Abel Assessment was found to be inadmissible in court cases in [[Massachusetts]], a ruling that was upheld by the [[Massachusetts Court of Appeals]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|first=Charles Patrick |last=Ewing |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/jan06/jn.aspx |title=Judicial Notebook – Testing tool in question |publisher=Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues, [[American Psychological Association]]|date= January 2006 |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The validity of the test's methodology has been criticized. Abel is said to have exaggerated various statistics in order to prove his point. In the early 90s, he announced that he had figures suggesting sex offenders commonly have multiple [[paraphilia]]s. However, Marshall and Eccles found in 1991 that he had not mentioned that he had concentrated on any offender reporting multiple deviant acts as more than one person. This greatly increased his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childmolestationprevention.org/pdfs/study.pdf |title=The Abel and Harlow Child Molestation Prevention Study |publisher=Childmolestationprevention.org |accessdate=2014-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abel made this assertion from the results of the report "The Abel and Harlow Child Molestation Prevention Study". The report was never subject to [[peer review]] or published in any [[professional journal]]. There is also no in-depth detail about his methodology available. The Abel Assessment is based on these findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frances |first=Allen |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/warning-sign-road-dsm-v-beware-its-unintended-consequences |title=A Warning Sign on the Road to DSM-V: Beware of Its Unintended Consequences |publisher=Psychiatric Times |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2014-02-17}} (membership required for access).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 decision on the admissibility of the test by Texas appellate judge Brian Quinn, the court said that since Abel's proprietary scoring methodology is not publicly known, it "could be mathematically based, founded upon indisputable empirical research, or simply the magic of young Harry Potter's mixing potions at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry".&lt;ref name=Chammah/&gt;

Abel states in his book that a therapist can use the test as a tool to determine if a child is attracted to other children. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled in 2004 that the Abel Assessment is a tool that is used only as [[Therapy|treatment]], and that it cannot detect whether a person has sexually abused children. Independent studies of the Abel Assessment have concluded it to be unreliable in adults and that there is not yet enough information to support its use with adolescents.

The Diana Screen is another test developed by Abel and his associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Micolucci | first =Vic | coauthors = | title =Test could be missing link in background checks | newspaper =[[WJXT|NBC 4 Jax]] | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =27 June 2013 | url = http://www.news4jax.com/news/does-new-test-prevent-child-sex-abuse/-/475880/20745492/-/i7cgnuz/-/index.html | accessdate =24 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It, too, has been a source of controversy for Abel due to it being a pass/fail test.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Activities==
AICE maintains a database that containing joint U.S.-Israel activities.  The database includes recipients of grants from the [[Binational Science Foundation]] (BSF), the Binational Agricultural Research and Development Foundation (BARD) and the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation (BIRD).&lt;ref name=about-aice/&gt; Its Economic Partnership Databank contains information on more than 10,000 U.S. companies doing business in or with Israel. To address the critical need to develop new scholars and place established Israel scholars on campus, AICE has created the Israel Scholar Development Fund (ISDF). Some of their other major projects include bringing Israeli professors to teach Israel-related courses on U.S campuses, supporting visiting Israeli scholars teaching in the US.

===Visiting Israeli Professors (VIPs)===
AICE fellowship program, "Schusterman Visiting Israeli Professors",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel |url=http://www.schusterman.org/interests/israel/schusterman-visiting-israel-professors |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140510224508/http://www.schusterman.org/interests/israel/schusterman-visiting-israel-professors |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 May 2014 |work=Charles &amp; Lynn Schusterman Family Foundation |accessdate=10 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; brings Israeli academics to American campuses&lt;ref name="haaretz.com 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title=The year BDS became the number one concern for American Jews | website=haaretz.com | date=December 27, 2014 | url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/.premium-1.633972 | access-date=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to ensure that expertise in the field will continue to be available from Israel while expanding within the United States. Visiting Israeli professors come from the Israeli universities [[Hebrew University]], [[University of Haifa]], [[Tel Aviv University]], [[Ben Gurion University]], and [[Bar Ilan University]]. In 2008, AICE financially assisted 29 Israelis (26 professors and three postdoctoral fellows) offering 70 courses in 27 universities throughout the United States and a further 11 graduate fellows and two postdoctoral research fellows. In the 2014-15 academic year, AICE reportedly selected 20 VIPs.&lt;ref&gt;https://israbib.wordpress.com/2012/07/10/fvipus1314/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anasyrma''' ({{lang-grc|ἀνάσυρμα}}) composed of ἀνά ''ana'' "up, against, back", and σύρμα ''syrma'' "skirt"; plural: '''anasyrmata''' ({{lang|grc|ἀνασύρματα}}), also called '''anasyrmos''' ({{lang|grc|ἀνασυρμός}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blackledge |first=Catherine |year=2009 |title=The Story of V: A Natural History of Female Sexuality |location=New Brunswick, New Jersey |publisher=Rutgers University Press |page=12 |isbn=978-0813534558}}&lt;!-- year was given as 2003, might be error, might be earlier edition--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[gesture]] of lifting the [[skirt]] or [[kilt]]. It is used in connection with certain [[religion|religious]] [[ritual]]s, eroticism, and lewd jokes (see, for example, [[Baubo]]). The term is used in describing corresponding works of [[art]]. Anasyrma differs from "flashing", a physically similar gesture as an act of [[exhibitionism]], in that an exhibitionist has an implied purpose of his/her own sexual arousal, while anasyrma is done only for the effect on the onlookers.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Anasyrma is effectively "the exposing of the genitals". This is a form of exhibitionism found in religion or artwork, rather than a display for arousal, and it always refers to the act of a woman exposing herself. The act of lifting up one's skirt to display the genitals can be an [[:en:wiktionary:apotropaic|apotropaic]] device; it can, in circumstances of war, evoke the fear of the enemy. It can also be an act that evokes surprise and subsequent laughter and a letting go of sadness. What is significant about anasyrma is that it reflects the numinous quality of the female genitals and the genital region through which birth ensues. In several cultures, there is a myth of anasyrma used for emotional healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miriam Robbins Dexter |author2=Victor H. Mair |title=Sacred Display: Divine and Magical Female Figures of Eurasia |publisher=Cambria Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1604976748}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anasyrma may be a deliberately provocative self-exposing of one's naked [[genitals]] or [[buttocks]]. The famous example of the latter case is [[Aphrodite Kallipygos]] ("Aphrodite of the beautiful buttocks"). In many traditions, this gesture also has an [[apotrope|apotropaic]] character, as a mockery or means to ward off a supernatural enemy, analogous to [[mooning]].

==Greek antiquity==
[[Image:Ermafrodito pubblicato in Marjon van der Meulen, Rubens Copies after the Antique.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hermaphroditus|Ermafrodito]] ''anasyromenos'' sketch by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].]]
Ritual jesting and intimate exposure were common in the cults of [[Demeter]] and [[Dionysus]], and figure in the celebration of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] associated with these divinities. The mythographer [[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]] says that Iambe's jesting was the reason for the practice of ritual jesting at the [[Thesmophoria]], a festival celebrated in honor of Demeter and Persephone. In other versions of the myth of Demeter, the goddess is received by a woman named Baubo, a [[crone]] who makes her laugh by exposing herself, in a ritual gesture called anasyrma ("lifting [of skirts]"). A set of statuettes from [[Priene]], a Greek city on the west coast of Asia Minor, are usually identified as "[[Baubo]]" figurines, representing the female body as the face conflated with the lower part of the abdomen. These appeared as counterparts to the [[phallus]]es decorated with eyes, mouth, and sometimes legs, that appeared on vase paintings and were made as statuettes.

Terracotta [[hermaphrodite]] figurines in the so-called ''anasyromenos'' pose, with female breasts and a long garment lifted to reveal male genitals have been found from [[Sicily]] to [[Lesbos]], dating back to the late [[Classical Greece|Classical]] and early [[Hellenistic period]]. The ''anasyromenos'' pose, however, was not invented in the 4th century BCE, figures of this type drew on a much earlier [[Eastern world|eastern]] [[Iconography|iconographic]] tradition employed for female divinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ik-morphomata.uni-koeln.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Fluide%20Ko%CC%88rper/Ajootian_abstract%26CV.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216191227/http://www.ik-morphomata.uni-koeln.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Fluide%20Ko%CC%88rper/Ajootian_abstract%26CV.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-12-16 |author=Aileen Ajootian |title=Hermaphroditos ανασυρόμενος: Revealing the Body |publisher=University of Mississippi |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient literature suggests that the figures represent the androgynous Cypriot deity [[Aphroditus]] (possibly a form of [[Astarte]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2005-ashtoreth#anchor4|title=Ashtoreth: In Arabia|publisher=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose cult was introduced into mainland Greece between the 5th–4th century BCE. The revealed [[phallus]] was believed to have [[apotropaic magic]]al powers, averting the [[evil eye]] or ''[[invidia]]'' and bestowing [[good luck]].

==Apotropaic effect of nakedness==
Many historical references suggest that anasyrma had dramatic or supernatural effect—positive or negative. [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote that a [[menstruating]] woman who uncovers her body can scare away [[hailstorms]], whirlwinds and lightning. If she strips naked and walks around the field, caterpillars, worms and beetles fall off the ears of corn. Even when not menstruating, she can lull a storm out at sea by stripping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pliny the Younger|title=Natural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5QVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=hailstorms+whirlwinds+and+lightnings+will+even+be+scared+away+by+a+woman+uncovering+her+body#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=xxviii. c.23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to folklore, women lifted their skirts to chase off enemies in [[Ireland]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 Questions: Miriam Robbins Dexter on the Power of Female Display |publisher=UCLA Program on Central Asia |date=October 6, 2010 |url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/asia/centralasia/article/117670 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A story from ''[[The Irish Times]]'' (September 23, 1977) reported a potentially violent incident involving several men, which was averted by a woman exposing her genitals to the attackers. According to [[Balkans|Balkan]] folklore, when it rained too much, women would run into the fields and lift their skirts to scare the gods and end the rain.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artnet.com/galleries/sean-kelly-gallery/marina-abramovic-balkan-erotic-epic/ |title=Marina Abramovic: Balkan Erotic Epic |publisher=Sean Kelly Gallery |location=New York |date=December 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jean de La Fontaine]]'s ''Nouveaux Contes'' (1674), a demon is repulsed by the sight of a woman lifting her skirt. Associated carvings, called [[sheela na gig]]s, were common on medieval churches in northern Europe and the British Isles.

In some nations of [[Africa]], a woman stripping naked and displaying herself is still considered a curse and a means to ward off evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Alexis Okeowo | title = The Ivory Coast Effect | url = http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-ivory-coast-effect | date = March 21, 2011 | work = The New Yorker | accessdate = 2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As women give life, they can take it away. In [[Nigeria]], among other places, women invoked the curse only under the most extreme circumstances, and men who are exposed are considered dead. No one will cook for them, marry them, enter into any kind of contract with them or buy anything from them. The curse extends to foreign men as well, who will go impotent or suffer some great harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imow.org/wpp/stories/viewStory?storyId=1098 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525164953/http://www.imow.org/wpp/stories/viewStory?storyId=1098 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-25 |title=The Curse of Nakedness |publisher=Imow.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioversity International''' is a global research-for-development organization with a vision – that [[agricultural biodiversity]] nourishes people and sustains the planet. The organization delivers scientific evidence, management practices and policy options to use and safeguard [[agricultural biodiversity]] to attain global [[food security|food]] and nutrition security, working with partners in low-income countries in different regions where agricultural biodiversity can contribute to improved nutrition, resilience, productivity and [[climate change adaptation]].

Bioversity International is a member of the [[CGIAR]], a global research partnership for a food-secure future.

The organization is highly decentralized, with about 300 staff working around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioversityinternational.org/about-us/where-we-work/ Where Bioversity International works]&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters are in [[Maccarese]], outside Rome, Italy, with regional offices located in Central and South America, West and Central Africa, East and Southern Africa, Central and South Asia, and South-east Asia.

== Background ==
Bioversity International is a research-for-development organization focused on safeguarding and using [[agricultural biodiversity]] to help meet challenges such as adaptation to [[climate change]] and increased [[sustainable production]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioversityinternational.org/e-library/publications/detail/bioversity-internationals-10-year-strategy-2014-2024 Bioversity International 10-year Strategy 2014-2024]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The organization takes the view that the diversity of plants and animals offers opportunities not only through [[Sexual reproduction|breeding]] but also by delivering many other benefits. Some are direct, such as the better nutrition and greater sustainability that come with locally-adapted crops. Others are indirect, like the [[ecosystem services]] delivered by healthy populations of [[pollinator]]s, [[biological control]] agents, and [[soil microbes]]. Agricultural biodiversity will also be absolutely essential to cope with the predicted impacts of climate change, not simply as a source of traits but as the underpinnings of more resilient farm ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioversityinternational.org/e-library/publications/detail/agricultural-biodiversity-is-essential-for-a-sustainable-improvement-in-food-and-nutrition-security Frison, E.A.; Cherfas, J.; Hodgkin, T.

== Governance ==
Bioversity International is governed by a Board of Trustees, including one Trustee nominated by the host country (Italy) and one nominated by [[FAO]]. The Board also appoints the Director General who manages the operation of the various programs. The current Director General, M. Ann Tutwiler&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cgiar.org/about-us/our-governance/center-director-generals/profile/tutwiler/|title=CGIAR Center Director Generals - Bioversity International|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cgiar.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, will remain in her position until the end of 2018.

==History==
In 2014, Bioversity International marked 40 years of operations. Bioversity International was originally established by the CGIAR as the International Board for [[Plant Genetic Resources]] (IBPGR) in 1974. In October 1991, IBPGR became the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) and in 1994 IPGRI began independent operation as one of the centers of the CGIAR. At the request of the CGIAR, in 1994 IPGRI took over the governance and administration of the International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain (INIBAP). In 2006, IPGRI and INIBAP became a single organization and subsequently changed their operating name to Bioversity International. Bioversity International still maintains the world's largest banana [[genetic database|gene bank]], the Bioversity International ''Musa'' Germplasm Transit Centre, that is hosted at the [[KU Leuven|Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] (KU Leuven) in Leuven, Belgium, and manages [[ProMusa]] - a platform that shares knowledge about [[Banana|bananas]] and [[Cooking banana|plantains]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioversityinternational.org/about-us/who-we-are/history/ Bioversity International history]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[Crop Trust|Global Crop Diversity Trust]] was established by Bioversity International on behalf of the CGIAR and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|UN Food and Agriculture Organization]], through a Crop Diversity Endowment Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://time.com/doomsday-vault/|title=Inside the 'Doomsday' Vault|last=|first=|date=|work=TIME|access-date=26 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Publications==
Bioversity International and its predecessors have published occasional papers under the title ''Issues in Genetic Resources''. In 2017, the organization published ''Mainstreaming Agrobiodiversity In Sustainable Food Systems - Scientific Foundations for an Agrobiodiversity Index'', a book that put the spotlight on the importance of [[Agricultural biodiversity|agrobiodiversity]] as the foundation of our food supplies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/26/sixth-mass-extinction-of-wildlife-also-threatens-global-food-supplies|title=Sixth mass extinction of wildlife also threatens global food supplies|last=|first=|date=|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Book censorship''' is when some authority, government or otherwise, takes measures to prevent access to a book or to part of its contents. It can be enacted at the national or subnational level, and can carry legal penalties. Books may also be [[Challenge (literature)|challenged]] at a local community level, although successful bans do not extend outside that area. Similarly, religions may issue lists of banned books—a historical example being the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''—which do not always carry legal force.

==Background==
"Almost every country places some restrictions on what may be published, although the emphasis and the degree of control differ from country to country and at different periods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/censorship-of-books/1|title=CENSORSHIP OF BOOKS|work=teara.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of reasons for which books may be banned. Materials are often suppressed due to the perceived notion of obscenity. This obscenity can apply to materials that are about sexuality, race, drugs, or social standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/bbooks/about|title=About Banned &amp; Challenged Books|work=ala.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The censorship of literature on the charge of obscenity appears to have begun in the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="universityofsouthflorida"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=rfh&amp;AN=ATLA0000696290&amp;site=eds-live|title=USF NetID Single-SignOn - University of South Florida|author=University of South Florida|work=usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the middle class, who had evangelical backgrounds, brought about this concern with obscenity.&lt;ref name="universityofsouthflorida"/&gt;

Governments have also sought to ban certain books which they perceive to contain material that could threaten, embarrass, or criticize them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/banned-books.html|title=Banned Books Online|work=upenn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other leaders outside the government have banned books, including religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
 | title = Index Librorum Prohibitorum
 | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church leaders who prohibit members of their faith from reading the banned books may want to shelter them from perceived obscene, immoral, or profane ideas or situations or from ideas that may challenge the teaching of that religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=54091811&amp;site=eds-live|title=USF NetID Single-SignOn - University of South Florida|author=University of South Florida|work=usf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But even religious materials have been subject to censorship. For example, various [[religious text|scriptures]] have been banned (and sometimes burned at several points in history). The [[Bible]], and other religious scriptures have all been subjected to censorship and have been banned by various governments. Similarly, books based on the scriptures have also been banned, such as [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'', which was banned in the [[Russian Empire]] for being [[anti-establishment]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sitemaker.umich.edu/globalnonviolence/files/tolstoy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Banning of a book often has the effect of making people [[Streisand effect|seek the book]].&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/09/20/224427254/could-banning-books-actually-encourage-more-readers|title=Could Banning Books Actually Encourage More Readers?|date=20 September 2013|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action of banning the book creates an interest in the book which has the opposite effect of making the work more popular.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

==Book burning==
[[Book burning]] is the practice of destroying, often ceremonially, books or other written material. It is usually carried out in public, and is generally motivated by moral, religious, or political objections to the material, with a desire to censor it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6995">[[File:Beethoven pf son 32 title.jpg|thumb|Original title page for the Piano Sonata, Opus 111]]
The '''Catalogues of Beethoven compositions''' are all of the different ways in which the [[List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven|musical compositions]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] have been organized by researchers into his music.

==The problem==
When Beethoven died, he left (as many other composers) a great many compositions behind.  In Beethoven's case, a sizable majority of his works were published.  However, some works were not published, and some works were unfinished, either because he had laid them aside, or died before he could finish them.  The catalogues described here are attempts to organize and identify with precision all of these works in ways that are useful to musicologists, musicians, and the listening public.

Most of Beethoven's best known works were published in his lifetime, and bear opus numbers, with which they may be reliably identified.  The short piano piece "[[Für Elise]]" is a notable exception: it is usually designated [[WoO]] (Werke ohne Opuszahl – literally, "works without opus number") 59.

==Opus number==
[[File:Beethoven_bust_statue_by_Hagen.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A bust of Beethoven, based on his 1812 life mask]]

The traditional 19th-century method of identifying a composer's works was for publishers to assign some sort of consecutive [[Opus number]] to the works as they were published.  This method is not entirely satisfactory to anyone.  Musicians and the listening public have no reliable way to distinguish different works with similar characteristics.  Musicologists cannot reliably identify unpublished works, nor do they have a reliable indication from the opus number of the actual composition date(s).  For example, the [[Octet (Beethoven)|Octet]], written from 1792 to 1793 is Opus 103, while Opus 102 and Opus 104 were written in 1815 and 1817 respectively. Some opus numbers comprise multiple pieces; 172 works are divided among 138 opus numbers.

All of Beethoven's compositions up to and including Opus 135 were published in Beethoven's lifetime; later numbers were published posthumously, and are generally denoted by "Op. posth."

==Kinsky catalogue==
{{see also|WoO (Beethoven)|List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven#List of works by number}}
In 1955, [[Georg Kinsky]] and [[Hans Halm]] published a catalogue of Beethoven's works, in which they assigned numbers to 205 "Werke ohne Opuszahl" (meaning "works without opus number" in German) to ''some'' of Beethoven's unpublished works.  These numbers given these works are generally preceded by "[[WoO]]".

The Kinsky–Halm catalogue also lists 18 works in an appendix as being either doubtfully attributed, or simply spurious. Some of those listed as doubtful have since been shown to be authored by Beethoven.{{Example needed}}  These numbers are generally preceded by "Anh.", short for German ''Anhang'', meaning ''appendix''.

==Hess catalogue==
The Swiss composer and musicologist [[Willy Hess (composer)|Willy Hess]] also researched and published a catalogue in the 1950s, in which he included pieces not included in the 19th century [[Beethoven Gesamtausgabe|complete edition]] published by [[Breitkopf and Härtel]]. Hess included many more fragmentary works than did Kinsky, and his catalog runs to 335 entries in the "Hauptkatalog" (main catalogue), and 66 "doubtful and falsely-attributed" works in an appendix. Many pieces have both WoO and H numbers.{{Example needed}}

==Biamonti catalogue==
Beethoven's compositions are also organized through the [[Biamonti Catalogue]], compiled by [[Giovanni Biamonti]] and published in 1968.  This work is an attempt to chronologically order all of Beethoven's creative output, in a manner similar to the catalogue of [[Franz Schubert]]'s works by [[Otto Erich Deutsch]].  It combines the pieces with opus numbers, all of the works from the Kinsky and Hess catalogues, and previously uncatalogued fragments, into a single list comprising 849 entries.

The concept of '''healthcare knowledge transfer using [[cinematography]]''' recognizes that films with carefully crafted and verified content, using graphics, animations and live-action video, can be one of the most efficient ways of transferring knowledge with clarity and speed, to both lay-people and healthcare professionals.

==History of medical cinematography==

===Late 19th century===

The use of cinematography to enhance healthcare practice and delivery dates back to the late 19th century in Western Europe. [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] (French scientist and physiologist), [[Eugène-Louis Doyen]] (French surgeon), [[Bolesław Matuszewski]] (Polish cameraman, in France his first name was written as Boleslas), and [[Gheorghe Marinescu]] (Romanian neurologist) are some of the pioneers of medical cinematography.&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Aubert. Arthur Van Gehuchten takes neurology to the movies. NEUROLOGY 2002;59:1612–1618&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, Doyen had his surgeries captured on film. His films were brought into disrepute by the fact that they were copied and shown on fairgrounds. The resulting social prejudice may explain the slow take-off of medical cinematography.  For example, in 1910 someone said the following regarding Doyen’s videos: ,“These pictures savoured of advertisement, and were never popular, save as a side show among the less scientifically inclined members of the profession.” &lt;ref&gt;Roentgen Cinematography. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 2603 (Nov. 19, 1910), p. 1645&lt;/ref&gt;  Doyen’s work, however, marked the distinction between the concepts of ‘film for entertainment’ versus ‘film for medicine’.

In 1893 Marey used the technique to study human physiology and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11lKItGNuiY movement]. In 1898 Boleslas Matuszewski recorded medical films in Paris (at the time, the world’s neurologic capital). At [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital|Salpêtrière and Pitié hospitals]] he filmed surgeries and cases of persons affected by nervous and mental disorders.

Gheorghe Marinescu (Romanian neurologist) studied under renowned French professor [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] and returned to Bucharest as Chief Physician at Pantelimon Hospital. Between 1898–1902 he conducted a cinematographic project, recording and analyzing a series of neurological conditions in patients. He perfected the application of filming techniques to clinical [[neurology]] and published five articles based on cinematographic analysis. Marinescu wrote that the role of cinematography is “to complement and even replace, in whatever measure possible, the descriptive exposition of phenomena by more rigorous, more exact analysis, which consists of recording movement with the help of special procedures” &lt;ref&gt;Barboi A C, Goetz C, Musetoiu R. The origins of scientific cinematography and early medical applications. NEUROLOGY 2004;62:2082–2086&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 [[Arthur Van Gehuchten]] (Belgian anatomist and neurologist) began to film neurologic patients and built up a collection of films for teaching purposes. His collection is exceptional both quantitatively and qualitatively.&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Aubert. Idem.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century: medical cinematography as [[propaganda]]===

In 1910 [[Thomas Edison]] produced the first ever public [[health education]] film, raising awareness about the prevention of [[tuberculosis]]. The view at the time was that “propagandists saw education as limited to providing facts. Propaganda was designed to control opinions and actions, without having to use direct force. Propaganda appealed to most progressive health reformers as a way of providing genuine popular democratic support for the trained medical elite.

Dr. H. E. Kleinschmidt of the Tuberculosis Association defined good propaganda as ‘mental inoculation’ whose avowed goal was ‘will-control through education’. The goal of health propagandists was not simply to inform but to persuade, to control individual thoughts and actions.” &lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin S. Pernick. Thomas Edison's Tuberculosis Films: Mass Media and Health Propaganda. The Hastings Center Report, Vol. 8, No. 3 (Jun., 1978), pp. 21-27&lt;/ref&gt;

Edison’s film came under criticism for “the distortions, exaggerations, and inaccuracies inherent in the [[melodrama]] format. The films clearly exaggerated the power of medicine to deal with tuberculosis; and they greatly over dramatized the effects and symptoms of the disease.” &lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

During World War I, the use of medical propaganda appealed to the US government and private agencies, which worked together “to produce and distribute anti-[[venereal disease]] motion pictures, including the feature-length melodramas [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0010131/ Fit to Fight] and The End of the Road and other lesser-known films. These movies, originally made for military trainees and war workers, were revised for showing to civilians, as evidence mounted that many soldiers had been infected prior to induction.” &lt;ref&gt;Martin S. Pernick. Sex Education Films. Isis, Vol. 84, No. 4 (Dec., 1993), pp. 766-768&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical cinematography employed in healthcare===

The 1930s saw the rise of medical cinematography employed to reach goals of [[public health]]. In 1933, the Journal of Communication published an article regarding [[immunization]] propaganda in the US: “Dr. Nash has enlisted the cinematograph film. He has noticed that American films illustrating immunization never show the instant of puncture, so that spectators are left to infer something disagreeable. But in the 16 mm. film taken by [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak Ltd.]] in his own clinic the whole operation is photographed, and although now and then there may be a grimace or a hint of nervousness, there is certainly no crying or resistance. The children in the film, quite unrehearsed, behave perfectly. It is an excellent film and should do much to dispel parental apprehensions.” &lt;ref&gt;Immunization Propaganda. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 1, No. 3769 (Apr. 1, 1933), p. 573&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1935 issue of the [[British Medical Journal]], one could read the following advice regarding the use of films in public health: “If the medical profession wanted, for example, to introduce widespread [[Preventive healthcare|prophylaxis]] against [[diphtheria]] it could take a leaf out of Papworth's book and tell a story on the films that would help to wipe out diphtheria in a few years' time. It is no good trying to persuade people of the Tightness of this or that measure of health with the sweet voice of reason. It is the emotional appeal that wins the day; reason follows humbly after. The film, with its forcible assault upon both eye and ear, is a powerful weapon of propaganda. And it could be used with effect for ‘putting across’ to the public the idea of preventive medicine. Perhaps the Minister of Health, [[Sir Kingsley Wood]], a master of propaganda, might enlist the help of the moving picture in his campaign for the improved health of the people.” &lt;ref&gt;Papworth and Propaganda. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 3911 (Dec. 21, 1935), pp. 1213-1214&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary cinematographic use in healthcare: healthcare knowledge transfer==

By the 1980s, medical films had become an established vehicle of both medical and patient training. A 1987 issue of the [http://journals.lww.com/AJNOnline/pages/default.aspx American Journal of Nursing] contained a full-page section on Films &amp; Tapes covering broad topics such as Aids to Daily Living for the elderly, working moms, AIDS, alcohol abuse and even emotional fitness.&lt;ref&gt;Film listings. The American Journal of Nursing, Vol. 87, No. 12 (Dec., 1987), p. 1713&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the concept of '''healthcare knowledge transfer''' recognizes that film clips (with carefully crafted and verified content, and using graphics, animations and live-action video), can be one of the most efficient ways of transferring knowledge with clarity and speed, to both lay-people (patients, families, and friends), and healthcare professionals.

Traditionally the transfer of generic information (i.e. non patient-specific information) tends to happen on a somewhat ad-hoc, live, one-to-one basis, that is generally less well structured, less comprehensive, and thus less successful (whilst also being more expensive and less time efficient).

However, in order to be efficient and effective, the quality of the film’s content must be very high. A patient’s understanding of conditions and treatments is important to their care and well-being, so it is useful for carefully crafted clips to be available 24/7. It also helps patients when attending the all-important one-to-one consultations that are the bedrock of good healthcare. If patients are better informed and better prepared they can focus on their own case rather than generic issues.

The literature in this area also contains examples of what can happen when the film content is not particularly well crafted and presented. In 2000, a UK cancer study highlights the impact of poor quality video. The authors acknowledge that “not all [[Randomized controlled trials|randomised trials]] of video education, however, have had similarly consistent results. A randomised trial in patients undergoing [[colonoscopy]] reported increased knowledge and satisfaction but failed to demonstrate a reduction in anxiety. A similar study in patients receiving [[genetic counseling]] reported similar benefits but again no reduction in anxiety. Two further randomised trials, the first in patients having breast surgery and the second in patients undergoing [[coronary angioplasty]], failed to show any improvement in satisfaction or anxiety. The variation in these trial results suggests that, like all educational materials, the quality of the content is paramount and how it is used is vital to success. Involving patients in the development and showing patients recounting their personal experience undoubtedly helps. Using respected TV personalities offers the familiar face of respectability and professionalism. Above all, most studies fail to take advantage of the role which video has to play in continuing the educational process at home with their carers and friends, but instead ask patients to watch it in the unfamiliar environment of the clinic.” &lt;ref&gt;Thomas R et al. Forewarned is forearmed - benefits of preparatory information on video-cassette for patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy - a randomised controlled trial. European Journal of cancer 36 (2000) 1536-1543).&lt;/ref&gt;

With the widespread use of the internet since the late 1990s, there is a tremendous potential for health-related films to be made available, free at the point of need, over the internet. Moreover, the 21st century sees an expanding integration of [[social media]] and [[mobile devices]] into our lives, thus enabling an even wider adoption of film-based health knowledge transfer.

==Case studies of healthcare knowledge transfer via cinematography==

A recent slate of long-form films includes ‘Outreach’ - a film about the workings of a specialist spinal injury unit, [http://www.spinalinjury.tv The Spinal Injury Patient Film], an award-winning film for new patients with spinal cord injuries, [http://www.choosingawheelchair.com Choosing a Wheelchair], a film about the correct protocol of wheelchair assessment and procurement for individual patients, and several films on [[cancer survivorship]].

===[http://www.choosingawheelchair.com Choosing a wheelchair]: case study in the UK===

The 55 minute production is set to help improve well-being and long-term outcomes for Britain's 1.2 million wheelchair users. Too many people do not understand the importance of getting the right wheelchair; the right set-up and support, and the appropriate pressure relief.  UK provision is patchy, indeed there is - surprisingly - no qualification requirement for a wheelchair services provider/specifier in the [[National Health Service]] (NHS).

The [http://www.choosingawheelchair.com film] includes leading experts and practitioners in this area, plus case studies, and even an introductory history of the wheelchair. It thus provides a comprehensive and holistic overview of best practice and assessment, and is supported by many voices of experience.
For the NHS the long-term cost benefits of proper provision in an aging population are very considerable.

===[http://www.spinalinjury.tv Spinal injury patient film]===

Newly injured [[Spinal Cord Injury]] (SCI) patients are anxious about what is happening to them and the related long-term implications. When a patient is admitted to hospital with an SCI it is traumatic for their family, friends and loved ones too. One challenge faced by clinicians is communicating with a patient’s ‘advocates’, people who may know little of spinal cord injury, the care process, nor the problems of prognosis. They may be understandably overwhelmed, they want answers… “doctor, will he/she walk again?”.

Inspired by patient feedback, award-winning director [[Marcus Dillistone]], has created the film [http://www.spinalinjury.tv “From Darkness Into Light”], to help explain the core issues with SCI and to provide patient insight. The film is designed not to replace face-to-face discussion, but to complement it.

The [http://www.spinalinjury.tv film] was conceived as a ‘prescriptive’ communications tool in hospitals, with the decision of when (and if) to introduce the film to the patient or their advocates being made by the clinical team.

===Cancer survivorship films===

When a person is diagnosed with cancer, treatment is often the focus of discussion among patients, health care providers and family. However, the next phase of care, [[cancer survivorship]], is much less discussed. The 2005 [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) report “From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition” &lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine: From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Translation. 2005, National Academy Press: Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; raised the awareness of the issue. Survivors of cancer face unique challenges, while health care providers do not always have the time, resource and training to provide counseling and assistance.

A 2005 randomized controlled study, Moving Beyond Cancer Trial,&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, A. L., et al., Outcomes from the Moving Beyond Cancer psychoeducational, randomized controlled trial with breast cancer patients. J Clin Oncol, 2005. 23(25): p. 6009-18.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a peer-modeling video as a psychoeducation tool is more effective than print materials in recovery of energy/vitality in post-treatment breast cancer patients. This 23-minute film, now available on the [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/breast/beyond-cancer-video National Cancer Institute website], addressed re-entry challenges in four life domains: physical health, emotional well-being, interpersonal relations, and life perspectives. Designed to promote adaptive peer modeling, the film observes four breast cancer survivors as they describe their experience in each of the four domains, as well as active coping skills they used to meet associated challenges. The film also includes commentary by an oncologist expert in breast cancer on the re-entry experience and on active methods for approaching problems during re-entry.

Since then, many video resources have been made available on the internet to cancer survivors and their care providers. Examples include a general education video on the issues of cancer survivorship produced by the IOM, a  video series by [[Living Beyond Breast Cancer]], a national education and support organization, addressing specific and sometimes sensitive issues during breast cancer survivorship.&lt;ref name="Video"&gt;{{cite web|title=I Am a Young Woman With Breast Cancer|url=http://www.lbbc.org/Audiences/Young-Women/Let-s-Talk-About-It-Video-Series|website=Living Beyond Breast Cancer|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dependency need''' is "the vital, originally infantile needs for mothering, love, affection, shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth." (Segen, 1992)  A dependency need is thought to be characterized by two components: (1) It is a real need of an organism, something that must be present in order for the organism to be able to thrive, (2) It is something that an individual cannot provide for him or herself.  It is well known that [[infant]]s have many dependency needs; some of these needs are obvious, others have only come to the attention of researchers as the result of [[epidemiological]] studies.  The more obvious needs of infants include: adequate feeding, adequate watering, adequate cleaning, adequate shelter, and more specifically, keeping the infant's body temperature within the narrow range of normalcy. On the other hand, it was not well known until the middle of the 20th century that infants also required the presence of warmth and affection, known as "[[maternal]] warmth".  The greatest number of dependency needs seem to be encompassed in infancy, however, dependency needs begin to change and decrease with age and [[maturity (psychological)|maturity]]. This marked decrease in dependency needs as an individual gets older can be largely attributed to the notion that, as an individual gets older, he or she becomes capable of providing these things for him or herself. However, to some extent, these needs remain present even into adulthood. Even as adults, people have certain universal dependency needs that remain constant throughout the lifespan that they are not able to provide for themselves; these include: the [[belongingness|need to belong]], need for affection, as well as the need for emotional support.   These needs can usually be met by partnership, in which both partners get used to depending on one another. If adults lack partnership, their needs can usually be met by family and/or friend relationships.

==Importance ==

Dependency need is an important psychological concept, encompassing the fields of [[psychological]], [[evolutionary]], and [[ethological]] theory.  [[Need]], in general, is a concept greatly studied in varying psychological fields, by psychologists with varying specialties.  Need is particularly important to the area of [[personality psychology]].  The concept of need can be defined as a "state of tension within a person", and as the need is satisfied, the state of tension is reduced. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008) It is thought that all individuals have needs, and that needs organize perceptions, guiding individuals to see what they want (or need) to see (Larsen &amp; Buss).  A physical or psychological need is capable of organizing action by compelling an individual to do what is necessary in order to fulfill such a need. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008)  After action has been taken to fulfill the need, the need subsides until it is again desired and recurs.

== History ==

It can be hypothesized that the concept of dependency need originated from the well-known psychologists [[Henry Murray]] and [[Abraham Maslow]]'s ideas about needs.  According to Murray, a need can be defined as a "potentiality or readiness to respond in a certain way under certain circumstances." (Murray, 1938)  Murray purposed a list of [[fundamental human needs]].  Each need was thought to be associated with "(1) a specific desire or intention, (2) a particular set of emotions, and (3) specific action tendencies." (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008)  Murray believed that human beings had their own [[hierarchy of needs]], unique to each individual. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008) It is thought that each individual's various needs exist at different levels of strength.

According to Maslow, the concept of need can be defined primarily by an individual's [[goal]]s. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008)  Maslow was a firm believer of [[self-actualization]], the process of becoming "more and more what one idiosyncratically is, becoming everything that one is capable of becoming." (Larson &amp; Buss, 2008)  Maslow believed that needs were hierarchically organized, with more basic needs found toward the bottom of the hierarchy and the self-actualization need at the top.  The needs defined by Murray and Maslow (physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness needs, esteem needs, self-actualization needs) seem to correspond with the vital needs encompassed in the concept of dependency need.

== Attachment theory's relevance ==

Dependency needs can sometimes be associated with [[Attachment Theory]].  Attachment can be defined as a "deep and enduring emotional bond that connects one person to another across time and space." (Ainsworth, 1973; Bowlby, 1969)  Attachment is thought to first occur between an infant and his or her primary caregiver. (Hetherington &amp; Parke, 1999)  [[Harry Harlow]] and his research in [[developmental psychology]] showed that attachment between infant and caregiver is vitally important to the [[psychological development]] of the infant and requires physical contact with a warm and responsive mother. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008)  These early experiences and reactions of the infants to the primary caregivers become working models for later adult relationships. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008)  Therefore, conclusions can be visibly drawn linking attachment and dependency need; vital, infantile needs for mothering, love, affection, shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth (dependency need) can stem from the type of interaction between that of an infant and his or her primary caregiver.  Three different types of attachment styles, securely attached, avoidantly attached, and ambivalent attached, can result from varying levels and styles of care a primary caregiver provides an infant.

== Further breakdown ==

Dependency needs can be categorized into biological needs and social needs.

=== Biological needs ===

Biological needs are basic survival needs, such as protection from harm, consumption of food, and regulation of body temperature; they are mechanisms used to promote and maintain proper body functioning.

=== Social needs ===

Social needs are "acquired psychological processes that activate emotional responses to particular need-relevant incentives." (Reeve, 2009)  Need for eye contact, expression of positive emotions by caretakers or loved ones, and cuddling—anything that fosters a sense of [[emotional security]]—can be defined as a social need.  There are four basic social needs: '''power''', '''achievement''', '''intimacy''', and '''affiliation.'''  People who have [[need for power|power needs]] look to gain dominance, achieve high statuses, and/or achieve high positions in their occupations, households, or social groups or organizations. These people look for leadership roles, and are usually happy and content when they are in control.  People who have [[need for achievement|achievement needs]] are willing to seek out and accomplish tasks.  The strive for achievement can develop strongly in children when influenced by their parents. Intimacy needs are linked to affiliation needs.  Intimacy needs can be sought out and met when in close, personal relationships with others. Fulfillment of intimacy needs can help decrease an individual's chance of developing onset of depression, as well as help reduce an individual's fears of being rejected.  [[need for affiliation|Affiliation needs]] are people's needs to feel a sense of involvement and "belonging" within a social group; affiliation needs have to do more with the acceptance of behavior.  It is [[human nature]] for people to want to be liked by others and get approval from them.  It is also innate for people to want to maintain healthy and positive relationships with others around them.

=== Key contributors ===

There have been numerous theorists who have done research in relation to dependency need.

'''Robert Bornstein''', a professor of psychology, researched certain levels of dependency needs, as well as [[personality disorder]]s related to dependency needs, including [[dependent personality disorder]] (DPD) and [[histrionic personality disorder]] (HPD).  Henry Murray's publication, Explorations in Personality (1938) describes differences and similarities between types of dependency needs.

As mentioned previously, [[Abraham Maslow]] was a key contributor to the establishment of a dependency need theory.  His need theory, [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]], is thought to help a person achieve the unsatisfied needs of one's self.  In his hierarchy, he outlined five needs crucial to [[Developmental psychology|human development]] and happiness across the lifespan; they are thought to occur in stages.  The five stages include, physiological needs, safety needs, social needs, self-esteem needs, and self-actualization. Physiological needs are needs that everyone has to have in order to survive, such as air, food, water, and sleep.  After a person has attained these physiological needs, he or she then focuses his or her attention to safety needs. Safety needs help an individual feel secure in order to make him or her feel safe, physically and emotionally. An example of this can be seen in people's choices of where they choose to live and work, and attaining medical insurance.  After safety needs are met, social needs are the focus of attention.  Social needs have to do with interactions with others (friends, family, romantic partners) and receiving love. After these needs have been met, one's self-esteem needs begin to arise. Esteem needs can be both internal and external. Having and achieving self-respect, receiving attention, and accomplishing achievements are examples of self-esteem needs. After one succeeds in the area of [[self-esteem]], [[self-actualization]] needs are to be met. One's full potential as a person, his or her ''self-actualization'', helps him or her keep developing as a person throughout the lifespan. (Maslow, 2002)

Another key contributor to the establishment of dependency need theory was Sigmund Freud's theory of [[psychosexual development]].

'''Freud's theory of psychosexual development'''

[[Sigmund Freud]] came up with a five-stage theory that stated human beings are born with sexual energy; this energy was thought to develop in five stages (oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital stages). The first stage, the [[oral stage]], occurs from birth to 2 years of age.  The key component of the oral stage is the child's fascination with his or her mouth, more specifically, putting items into his or her mouth, breast feeding, etc. The child is thought to get great pleasure from such objects being placed in his or her mouth. The second stage, the [[anal stage]], occurs from 18 months of age to 3 years. In this stage, the child's main focus is on his or her anus, and the experience of toilet training is thought to be quite pleasurable. The third phase, the [[phallic stage]], occurs from 3 years of age to 6 years of age. In this stage, the main focus of the child is on discovering his or her genital region. Children become more aware of their own bodies, the bodies of other children, as well as their parents' bodies. Children also become aware of anatomical sex differences between male and female genitalia.  Freud believed during this stage, that boys had the idea that they needed to compete with their fathers in order to possess their mothers.  He also believed that girls felt penis envy towards males, and therefore blamed their mothers for not having a penis; the girls then competed for psychosexual possession of their fathers. The fourth stage, the [[latency stage]], occurs from 6 years of age until the child reaches puberty.  In this stage, children are thought to be "latent" of sexual energies, however sexual urges still remain. During this time, children play with the same sex friends.  The final stage in psychosexual development is the [[genital stage]], occurring from puberty through the rest of adulthood.  In this stage, individuals focus on detaching from their parents, doing their own thing and not relying as much on their parents. In this stage, genitalia is the main focus and sexual energy and urges are normal. The person's concern is now focused on mature, adult friendships and family relationships, as well as intimate relationships, and adult responsibilities. (Basic, 2011)

There are differences and similarities worth noting when it comes to biological needs and social needs. Biological needs are required for survival in everyday life, whereas social needs are acquired and learned. Similarities between the two include the relevance that an individual requires both types of needs in one's life in order to live happy, healthy lives in which he or she is able to thrive and succeed; if an individual's needs are not met, he or she may become sad and/or depressed.

== What happens when dependency needs are not met ==

A person's vital needs for mothering, love, affection, shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth are ever so important to an individual.  If these dependency needs are not met, particularly when an individual is younger, emotional, psychological, as well as physical problems may result down the road. Also, [[mental retardation]] or even death can result in extreme cases of neglect of dependency needs (usually in cases when biological needs are neglected). In general, depression, sadness, and loneliness are likely results if dependency needs are not met no matter what age an individual is.

== Key experiments ==

Many experiments relating the importance of dependency need have been conducted over the years; here, three influential experiments are outlined.

=== Harry Harlow monkey experiment ===
[[File:Rhesus Macaque (Macaca mulatta) (5780783616).jpg|thumb|upright|Harlow exclusively used rhesus macaques in his experiments.]]

When this study was conducted in 1957, [[Harry Harlow]] was questioning current theories about dependency and love. At this time, Harlow and his team stated that love began developing as a feeding bond between an infant and its mother; this notion applied to family members, as well. It was also thought that humans, along with other social animals, lived in organized societies in order to regularize sexual contact. Harlow, being fascinated with the concept of love and nurturing, worked with monkeys to test these theories. (Berger, 2005)

In Harlow's monkey experiment, newborn monkeys were separated from their mothers almost immediately after birth. They were then raised with substitute "mothers" made of either (1) wire or (2) wood covered with a soft cloth. In one of the experiments, both the wire and wood mothers were presented to the infant monkey in the same cage, and only one wore a nipple, which the infant was able to nurse from. Some of the monkeys nursed from the wire mother, and others from the cloth mother. According to Berger, Harlow found that even when the wire mother was the source of food the infant monkey spent more of its time with the cloth surrogate. Harlow also found that the cloth mother provided not only food to the infant monkeys, but also was able to provide comfort and security for them.  The interpretation made by Harlow about this was that the liking for the cloth surrogate mother showed the importance of [[affection]], emotion, nurturance, and dependency in mother child relationships.

=== René Spitz orphan study ===

The phenomenon of infant dependency need was first noticed in [[René Spitz]]'s orphan study.  It was during this study that researchers learned of the higher mortality rates for infants maintained in [[orphanage]]s. When the obvious factors such as inadequate [[nutrition]], contagious [[disease]]s, etc., were ruled out, researchers discovered that mortality rates could be greatly ameliorated by having the nurses in charge of the infants in the orphanages [[cuddle]] them in a way that approximated the amount of cuddling infants would normally receive from their own [[parent]]s.

Spitz's orphan study focused on two groups of children, starting when the children were infants, and continued all the way until they reached 12 years of age. The first group of children were raised in an orphanage; the children in this group only received minimal care, let alone any special, one-on-one time with a caregiver. In the second group, each infant received individual care from various women caregivers serving a prison sentence; these caregivers were with the children for the first year of their lives. When the children in each group turned two years old, dramatic differences occurred between them.

Results from the experiment showed drastic differences. It was found that children raised in the orphanage, whom had received minimal care, had less developmental progress than children raised in the prison. Only 26 kids could walk, and only a few could talk. Some of the orphanage kids had signs of mental retardation and were psychologically and socially underdeveloped for their age. Whereas in the prison group, most all the children had reached the point of full development for their age division.

Defined previously, dependency needs are "The vital, originally infantile needs for mothering, love, [[affection]], shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth" (Segen, 1992). When those needs are not met psychological, emotional, physical and attachment problems can arise. This was shown in the Spitz orphan study. (Shepard, 2013)

=== Types of attachment ===

"[[Attachment theory]] states that a child's first relationship is a love relationship that will have profound, long-lasting effects on an individual's subsequent development." (Colin, 1991) The closeness of the child to the person providing protection and a sense of [[security]] will becomes this figure to the child. This figure lays the foundation for the child to be able to form other secure relationships in the future.  There are four main types of attachment, including: secure, anxious/avoidant, anxious/ambivalent and disorganized/disoriented.

In securely attached babies, the baby's attachment figure is an effective secure base from them. They are able to explore the world and can even handle brief separation in an environment unfamiliar to them. They are secure in the fact that they know the attachment figure will return and that there is little to no anxiety experienced. (Colin, 1991)

In anxious/avoidant attachment, the baby is [[anxious]] about the attachment figure's (typically a parent) responsiveness. The baby then develops a defensive strategy for managing his or her own anxiety. The baby experiencing this situation has very little, to no confidence in relation to being responded to; so when the baby seeks care, the child expects to be rejected. For example, if the baby is hungry, he or she will not tell anyone/cry because he or she doesn't expect anyone to meet this need. (Colin, 1991)

In anxious/ambivalent attachment, signs of [[anxiety]], anger, and mixed feelings about the attachment figure are present in the baby; this is especially true after brief separations of the baby from the attachment figure, occurring in unfamiliar environments. (Colin, 1991)

In disorganized/disoriented babies, the baby does not have a consistent strategy for managing separation and reunion with his or her attachment figure. Some of the babies show to be depressed, demonstrate avoidant behavior, express anger, and/or show disturbing behaviors. Infants in this category have typically been [[child abuse|maltreated]]. (Colin, 1991)

== Today and future ==

=== Current research ===

The research currently being done in the last few years in relation to dependency need relates largely to [[attachment theory]].  Most studies of attachment theory focus on how attachment relates to other aspects in the individual's life; for example, how an individual's attachment style (developed early on) affects his or her display of emotions after a break-up, or how an individual's attachment style affects his or her ability to make new friends in college.

A study done in 2010 by Stephanie Parade, Esther Leerke, and Nayena Blankson looked at the correlation between an individual's attachment to his or her parents and how well he or she is able to make friends; this study specifically focused on college-age individuals. The study also looked at [[social anxiety]] as the mediator.  The results of this study show that the more securely attached a person is to his or her parents; the easier it is for him or her to make friends.  These findings are consistent to Bowlby's proposition. The authors also found that social anxiety only showed up in the minority. The participants in the minority group had less social anxiety when they had a secure relationship with their parents, which in turn helped them be more sociable overall. (Parade, Leerke, &amp; Blankson, 2010)

Another current study done by Gnilka, Ashby, and Noble, looked at "adult attachment styles and the psychological outcomes, like hopelessness and [[life satisfaction]], using maladaptive and [[adaptive]] perfectionism as the mediators." (Gnika, Ashby, &amp;  Noble, 2013) The results show that having high levels of avoidant or anxiety attachment will cause low maladaptive perfectionism, which overall makes one more likely to have low life satisfaction and high levels of hopelessness. These findings can benefit counselors when working with patients who have problems with [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]].

==== Relationship to female suicide attempts ====

Not a whole lot of research is going on in this field today.  One article, done in 1995, looked at female suicide and dependency needs. The focus of the article was on the dependency needs of female adolescent suicide attempters and non-attempters. It also looked at other social network and intimate relationships for both suicide attempters and non-attempters. The authors hypothesized that dependency needs would be higher in suicide attempters. The results displayed a similarity in both groups, although, the sample size was too small to generalize to attempters. The article suggests future research on the range of dependency and the effect dependency might have on suicide. (Beettridge &amp; Favreau, 1995)

=== Viability ===

In the last decade, research on the topic of dependency need has been declining.  The theory of dependency need has largely been incorporated into [[attachment theory]].

== Conclusions ==

Vital, originally infantile needs for mothering, love, affection, shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth, more specifically known as "dependency needs", change and decrease with age and maturity. As an individual gets older, these needs usually decrease in strength and can normally be met individually, or fulfilled by relationships among partners, family members or friends.

By looking at historical research pioneered by Murray, Maslow, Freud, and Harlow, as well as more recent concepts developed by Spritz, Colin, Parade et al., Beettridge &amp; Favreau, one can determine that dependency need is an important psychological concept, encompassed in many areas of psychology.  Throughout time, the basic needs related to safety, love, affection, and protection have seemed to be a subject of utmost importance.  No matter the way one theorizes the concept of dependency need, it is well known that all humans seem to have these basics needs.  It is also known that if these needs are somehow not adequately met, the person who has been neglected in this way, will likely suffer deep-seated emotional, psychological, and possibly even physical hardships.

Today, the concept of dependency need is largely interrelated with the concept of attachment theory. Nowadays, a lot of attachment theory studies are interested in seeing if there is a relationship between a person's style of attachment (developed in infancy) and the way in which he or she deals with whatever life throws his or her way (years later); i.e., dealing with emotions after a break-up or making friendships in college. Conclusions can be visibly drawn linking attachment and dependency need; vital, infantile needs for mothering, love, affection, shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth (dependency need) can stem from the type of interaction between that of an infant and his or her primary caregiver.  Attachment theory can also go beyond infancy to look at how early interactions have shaped an individual's personality, and how he or she deals with life situations years and years down the road.  Dependency need continues to be a concept that is of great interest to psychologists (more specifically tied into attachment theory) and is ever-present in the everyday lives of all human beings.

'''Etiology''' ({{IPAc-en|iː|t|i|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}; alternatively '''aetiology''' or '''ætiology''') is the study of [[Causality|causation]], or origination. The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αἰτιολογία}}, ''aitiología'', "giving a reason for" ({{lang|grc|αἰτία}}, ''aitía'', "cause"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logía]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Aetiology | work = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = 2nd | year = 2002 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-521942-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More completely, etiology is the study of the causes, origins, or reasons behind the way that things are, or the way they function, or it can refer to the causes themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|etiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is commonly used in [[medicine]], (where it is a branch of medicine studying causes of disease) and in [[philosophy]], but also in [[physics]], [[psychology]], [[Forms of government|government]], [[geography]], [[spatial analysis]], [[theology]], and [[biology]], in reference to the causes or origins of various [[phenomena]].

In the past, when many physical phenomena were not well understood or when histories were not recorded, [[myth]]s often arose to provide etiologies. Thus, an etiological myth, or [[origin myth]], is a myth that has arisen, been told over time or written to explain the origins of various social or natural phenomena. For example, [[Virgil]]'s [[Aenead]] is a [[national myth]] written to explain and glorify the origins of the [[Roman Empire]]. In [[theology]], many religions have [[creation myths]] explaining the origins of the world or its relationship to believers.

==Medicine==
{{Main|Cause (medicine)}}
In medicine, the etiology of an illness or condition refers to the frequent studies to determine one or more  factors that come together to cause the illness. Relatedly, when disease is widespread, [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies investigate what associated factors, such as location, sex, exposure to chemicals, and many others, make a population more or less likely to have an illness, condition, or disease, thus helping determine its etiology. Sometimes determining etiology is an imprecise process. In the past, the etiology of a common sailor's disease, [[scurvy]] was long unknown. When large, ocean-going ships were built, sailors began to put to sea for long periods of time, and often lacked fresh fruit and vegetables. Without knowing the precise cause, [[Captain Cook|Captain James Cook]] suspected scurvy was caused by the lack of vegetables in the diet.  Based on his suspicion, he forced his crew to eat [[sauerkraut]], a cabbage preparation, every day, and based upon the positive outcomes, he [[inferred]] that it prevented scurvy, even though he did not know precisely why. It took about another two hundred years to discover the precise etiology: the lack of [[vitamin C]] in a sailor's diet.

== Mythology ==
{{Main|Origin myth}}
An etiological myth, or origin myth, is a [[mythology|myth]] intended to explain the origins of cult practices, natural phenomena, proper names and the like. For example, the name [[Delphi]] and its associated deity, ''[[Apollo|Apollon Delphinios]]'', are explained in the [[Homeric Hymn]] which tells of how Apollo, in the shape of a [[dolphin]] (''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphis}}''),  propelled [[Crete|Cretans]] over the seas to make them his priests. While Delphi is actually related to the word ''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphus}}'' ("womb"), many etiological myths are similarly based on [[folk etymology]] (the term "[[Amazons|Amazon]]", for example). In the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (published circa 17 BC), [[Virgil]] claims the descent of [[Augustus Caesar]]'s [[Julian clan]] from the hero [[Aeneas]] through his son [[Ascanius]], also called Iulus. The story of [[Prometheus]]' sacrifice [[trick at Mecone]] in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' relates how Prometheus tricked [[Zeus]] into choosing the bones and fat of the first sacrificial animal rather than the meat to justify why, after a sacrifice, the Greeks offered the bones wrapped in fat to the gods while keeping the meat for themselves. In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Pyramus and Thisbe]]'', the origin of the color of mulberries is explained, as the white berries become stained red from the blood gushing forth from their double suicide.

[[File:Everybody Draw Mohammed Day.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Cartoon, "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!"]]

'''Everybody Draw Mohammed Day''' (or '''Draw Mohammed Day''') was a 2010 event in support of artists threatened with violence for drawing [[Depictions of Muhammad|representations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad]]. It stemmed from a protest against [[censorship]] of the American television show ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]", led by the show's distributor [[Comedy Central]], in response to death threats that had been made against some of those responsible for two segments broadcast in April 2010. A drawing representing [[Mohammed]] was posted on the Internet on April 20, 2010, with a message suggesting that "everybody" create a drawing depicting Mohammad on May 20 in support of free speech.

U.S. [[cartoon]]ist Molly Norris of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] created the artwork in reaction to Internet death threats that had been made against animators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] for depicting Muhammad in an episode of ''[[South Park]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4674864.stm |title =Q&amp;A: Depicting the Prophet Muhammad |publisher =BBC News |date =February 2, 2006 |accessdate=February 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Postings on RevolutionMuslim.com (under the pen name  Abu Talha al-Amrikee; later identified as [[Zachary Adam Chesser]]) had said that Parker and Stone could wind up like [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], a Dutch filmmaker who was stabbed and shot to death.&lt;ref name="Theo van Gogh murder"&gt;{{cite news|title=Life of slain Dutch film-maker|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3975211.stm|accessdate=May 22, 2012|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=November 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norris claimed that, if people draw pictures of Muhammad, [[Islamic terrorism|radical Islamist terrorists]] would not be able to murder them all, and threats to do so would become unrealistic. Within a week, Norris' idea became popular on [[Facebook]], was supported by numerous [[bloggers]], and generated coverage on the blog websites of major U.S. newspapers. As the publicity mounted, Norris and the man who created the first Facebook page promoting the May 20 event disassociated themselves from it. Nonetheless, planning for the protest continued with others "taking up the cause".&lt;ref name="erases"/&gt; Facebook had an "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" page, which grew to over 100,000 participants (101,870 members by May 20). A protest page on Facebook against the initiative named "Against ‘Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'" attracted slightly more supporters (106,000 by May 20).&lt;ref name=figure/&gt; Subsequently, Facebook was temporarily blocked by Pakistan; the ban was lifted after Facebook agreed to block the page for users in India and Pakistan.

In the media, Everybody Draw Mohammed Day attracted support from commentators who felt that the campaign represented important issues of freedom of speech, and the need to stand up for this freedom.

==History==
{{Criticism of religion sidebar}}

===Background===
''[[South Park]]'' episodes "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]", broadcast in April 2010, featured a character in a bear costume, who various other characters stated was Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =James | first = Frank |author2=Mark Memmott | title = Facebook Blocked By Pakistani Court For 'Draw Muhammad' Day | work =[[National Public Radio]]: The two-way | publisher = www.npr.org | date = May 19, 2010 | url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/05/facebook_blocked_by_pakistani.html | accessdate =May 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''South Park'' episode sparked statements from the extremist website [[Revolution Muslim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bates | first = Theunis | title = Pakistan Bans Facebook Over Muhammad Cartoons | work = AOL News | language =  | publisher = www.aolnews.com | date = May 19, 2010 | url = http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/pakistan-bans-facebook-over-muhammad-cartoons/19483123 | accessdate = May 19, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100520033044/http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/pakistan-bans-facebook-over-muhammad-cartoons/19483123 | archivedate = May 20, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Rodriguez | first =Alex | title = Facebook dark in Pakistan amid uproar over Muhammad caricatures|work=Los Angeles Times | publisher = www.latimes.com | date = May 19, 2010 | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-facebook-20100520,0,4071401.story | accessdate =May 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which posted a picture of the partially decapitated body of the Dutch filmmaker, [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], with a statement declaring that Parker and Stone could meet a similar fate. The group running the website said it was not threatening Parker and Stone, however, it also posted the addresses of Comedy Central's New York office and the California production studio where ''South Park'' is made.&lt;ref name=jgscl&gt;{{Cite news| last = Griswold | first =Jamie ([[Associated Press]]) | title =Seattle cartoonist launches 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' | work =MyNorthwest.com | publisher = Bonneville International | date = April 25, 2010 | url = http://www.mynorthwest.com/?nid=11&amp;sid=313170# | accessdate =May 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comedy Central]] [[self-censored]] the episode when it was broadcast by removing the word "Muhammad" and a speech about intimidation and fear from the ''South Park'' episode.&lt;ref name=jgscl/&gt;

===Molly Norris cartoon===
Molly Norris drew the original, poster-like cartoon on April 20, 2010, which declared May 20, 2010, to be the first annual "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day". The drawing showed various [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] objects, including a coffee cup, a cherry and a box of pasta, each claiming to be the likeness of Muhammad. Norris used an alternate [[transliteration]] of "Mohammed" on her poster.&lt;ref name=jotcoelat&gt;Orr, Jimmy, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/04/creators-of-everybody-draw-muhammad-day-abandon-effort-after-it-becomes-controversial.html "Creators of 'Everybody Draw Muhammad Day' drop gag after everybody gets angry"], April 26, 2010, "Top of the Ticket" blog, ''Los Angeles Times''. Retrieved April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the top of the illustration she wrote: {{quote|text=In light of the recent veiled (ha!) threats aimed at the creators of the television show South Park ... by bloggers on Revolution Muslim's website, we hereby deem May 20, 2010 as the first 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!'

In late April, after she had rejected the idea for the May 20 protest, Norris stated on her website: "This was always a drawing about rights, never MEANT to disrespect religion. Alas – if we don't have rights, we will not be able to practice the religion of our choice. [...] None of these little characters ARE the likeness of Mohammed, they are just CLAIMING to be!" She also wrote, "I, the cartoonist, NEVER launched a draw Mohammed day. It is, in this FICTIONAL poster sponsored by this FICTIONAL GROUP", referring to the "Citizens Against Citizens Against Humor" wording in the cartoon. "SATIRE about a CURRENT EVENT, people!!! (That's what {{sic|cartoonist|'s}} do!)"&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Mollie, Web page titled [http://www.mollynorris.com/posterdescribed.html "Lighten up!

===Early publicity===
Norris circulated the cartoon to bloggers based in [[Seattle, Washington]].&lt;ref name="gosalvez"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Gosalvez | first = Patricia | title =La 'bloguera', el profeta y Facebook – El temor obliga a una dibujante a retirar una campaña para pintar a Mahoma | work =[[El País]] |language=Spanish| publisher =www.elpais.com | date = May 3, 2010 | url = http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Pantallas/bloguera/profeta/Facebook/elpepirtv/20100504elpepirtv_4/Tes| accessdate =May 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She sent a copy of her illustration to [[Dan Savage]], who posted it on his blog on April 22. On April 23, she was interviewed by Dave Ross of [[KIRO-FM|KIRO]], a local Seattle radio station. Norris responded to a question "Are you sure you want to do this?", and said "Yeah, I want to water down the targets ... as a cartoonist I just felt so much passion about what had happened, I wanted to counter Comedy Central’s message about feeling afraid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Perkins| first = Mary | title = Seattle Cartoonist’s "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" Goes Viral | work =[[Seattlest]] | location = [[Seattle, Washington]] | publisher =[[Gothamist]] | date = April 27, 2010 | url = http://seattlest.com/2010/04/27/seattle_cartoonists_everybody_draw.php | accessdate = May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The motivation for the protest was not simply to defend the ''South Park'' creators, but also to support the right to [[free speech]] under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last =Pries | first =Steve | title ='Everyone draw Mohammed day' challenges South Park censorship | work =The Depaulia | publisher =media.www.depauliaonline.com, [[DePaul University]] | date =May 17, 2010 | url =http://media.www.depauliaonline.com/media/storage/paper1414/news/2010/05/17/News/everyone.Draw.Mohammed.Day.Challenges.South.Park.Censorship-3919751.shtml | accessdate =May 17, 2010 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100521235514/http://media.www.depauliaonline.com/media/storage/paper1414/news/2010/05/17/News/everyone.Draw.Mohammed.Day.Challenges.South.Park.Censorship-3919751.shtml | archivedate =May 21, 2010 | df =mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said, "it's a cartoonist's job to be [[Political correctness|non-PC]]."&lt;ref name=ross&gt;[http://www.mynorthwest.com/resources/audio_headlines/audio_player.php?a=16801&amp;f=/kiro/2010/04/04232010140224.mp3 Dave Ross Interviews Molly Norris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428224744/http://www.mynorthwest.com/resources/audio_headlines/audio_player.php?a=16801&amp;f=%2Fkiro%2F2010%2F04%2F04232010140224.mp3 |date=April 28, 2010 }}, MyNorthwest.com, April 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On her website, Norris stated that the idea was not to disrespect Islam, but to support everybody's freedom of expression.&lt;ref name=mnwco&gt;{{Cite web| author = [[Associated Press]] | title = Cartoonist overwhelmed by response to "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" | date = April 27, 2010 | url = http://www.mynorthwest.com/?sid=313601&amp;nid=11 | work = MyNorthwest.com | accessdate = May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" Facebook page was created by Jon Wellington. By the morning of April 26, the page had almost 6,000 confirmed guests.

===Cartoonist and Facebook page creator end involvement===
On April 25, Norris wrote on her website that the response to her idea had surprised and shocked her: "I did not intend for my cartoon to go [[Viral phenomenon|viral]]. I did not intend to be the focus of any 'group'. I practice the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by drawing what I wish. This particular cartoon of a 'poster' seems to have struck a gigantic nerve, something I was totally unprepared for. I am going back to the drawing table now!"&lt;ref name=mnwco/&gt;&lt;ref name="howardfriedman" /&gt; On April 26, she wrote on her website: "I am NOT involved in "Everybody Draw Mohammd [''[[sic]]'' ] Day! I made a cartoon that went viral and I am not going with it. Many other folks have used my cartoon to start sites, etc. Please go to them as I am a private person who draws stuff".&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt; She also asked Savage to replace the original illustration she had given him with another one she drew that was tamer, but Savage refused. Asked why she initially publicized it, she replied, "Because I'm an idiot."&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt;

Norris said the campaign had grown much bigger than she initially intended, and that her cartoon was being used in ways she couldn't control. "I just want to go back to my quiet life", she told the writer of a blog about comics at ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name=mcpspc/&gt; Wellington announced on April 26 that he, too, was dropping out of the movement. "I am aghast that so many people are posting deeply offensive pictures of the Prophet," he wrote.&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt;&lt;ref name="rickmoran" /&gt; "Y'all go ahead if that's your bag, but count me out."&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt;&lt;ref name="rickmoran"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Moran | first =Rick | title = A Lesson for our Post-Modern Media Environment | work = The Moderate Voice | publisher = Newstex | date = April 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris acknowledged, "I said that I wanted to counter fear and then I got afraid."&lt;ref name="erases" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =The PM wrestles with greatest non-core moral issue of the election after next |work=The Australian | publisher = www.theaustralian.com.au | date = April 27, 2010 | url =http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/the-pm-wrestles-with-greatest-non-core-moral-issue-of-the-election-after-next/story-e6frg6zo-1225859056591 | accessdate =May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 29, Norris suggested that "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" be called off: "Let's call off 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' by changing it to 'Everybody Draw Al Gore Day' instead. Enough Mohammed drawings have already been made to get the point across. At this juncture, such drawings are only hurtful to more liberal and moderate Muslims who have not done anything to endanger our first amendment rights."&lt;ref&gt;Cavna, Michael, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/04/apologetic_draw_muhammad_carto.html "Apologetic 'Draw Muhammad' cartoonist urges 'Draw Al Gore' instead [VIDEO&amp;#93;"], 8:38 a.m. update of a 1 a.m. post, April 30, 2010, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, Norris posted a marked up version of her original cartoon, apologizing to Muslims.&lt;ref name=posterdescribed/&gt;

Norris' change in position received varying reactions from commentators. [[Kathleen Parker]], an opinion columnist for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', wrote, "Norris's cartoon was a fine idea, but she should be relieved of further duty or responsibility."&lt;ref name=kpfos&gt;Parker, Kathleen, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042703813.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 "Freedom of sketch"], opinion article, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 27, 2010. Retrieved April 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Alex Spillius commented, "No one should blame Norris for withdrawing from the fray, for this kind of case throws up lingering and insidious uncertainties. Any threat could blow over quickly or endure, [[The Satanic Verses controversy|Rushdie-style]], for decades. The row over the cartoons depicting Mohammed in the Danish paper Jyllands-Posten percolated for months before bubbling over into violent protests."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Spillius | first = Alex | title =America's disappointing reaction to South Park censorship |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | publisher = Telegraph Media Group Limited | date = May 1, 2010| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/7663598/Americas-disappointing-reaction-to-South-Park-censorship.html| accessdate = May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; William Wei of ''[[The Business Insider]]'' was more critical of the decision by the cartoonist to withdraw from the protest movement, with an article titled, "Artist Who Proposed 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!'

But if you want to live in a Western society and use the system to protect your rights, you have to be willing to allow others to have theirs as well," said Mimi.&lt;ref name="moye" /&gt;

Writing for ''[[ComicsAlliance]]'', Laura Hudson noted that the website supported the protest movement and would participate in the event on May 20, 2010: "There is power in numbers, and if you're an artist, creator, cartoonist, or basically anyone who would like to exercise your right to free speech in a way that it is actively threatened, that would be the day to do it. ... if you're an artist, cartoonist, or creator who plans to participate, drop us a line and let us know—we'll be adding our own terribly drawn rendition of the prophet here on ComicsAlliance when the day rolls around and we'd love it if you joined us."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hudson |first=Laura |title=Everybody Draw Mohammed Day Invites Artists to Defend Their Freedom of Speech |work=[[ComicsAlliance]] |publisher=AOL Inc |date=April 27, 2010 |url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/04/27/everybody-draw-mohammed-day/ |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430231702/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2010/04/27/everybody-draw-mohammed-day |archivedate=April 30, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 3, 2010 piece for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blog, the founder and president of the [[Secular Coalition for America]], Herb Silverman, wrote in support of the protest movement.&lt;ref name="herbsilverman"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Silverman| first = Herb | title = In support of Draw Muhammad Day |work=The Washington Post blog | publisher = [[The Washington Post Company]] | date = May 3, 2010 | url = http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/herb_silverman/2010/05/draw_muhammad_day.html | accessdate = May 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Silverman stated he agreed with the rationale behind the idea, commenting, "Whether this succeeds or not, and I have no personal interest in drawing Muhammad, I support the concept. We must join together to stop injustice."&lt;ref name="herbsilverman" /&gt;

A columnist for [[The Washington Post Writers Group]] wrote that Norris should not be regarded as having further responsibility related to the movement; and affirmed that her Muhammad cartoon had significantly impacted a greater discussion about the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Cavna | first =Michael | title = Pulitzer winners back ' South Park ' – Cartoonists denounce censorship of show after group's threats | work = [[The Washington Post]] | publisher = [[The Washington Post Company]]| page = C5 | date =April 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Telepolis]]'' described some of the pictures submitted to the Facebook group in support of the protest movement as, "funny, crude, silly, original, the whole range of possibilities."&lt;ref name="corinth" /&gt; ''[[The Jawa Report]]'' urged individuals to participate in the protest movement, but encouraged them to post images reflecting positively on Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Allahakchew aka SH | title = Everybody Draw A POSITIVE Mohammed Day | work = [[The Jawa Report]] | publisher = mypetjawa.mu.nu | date = May 8, 2010 | url =http://mypetjawa.mu.nu/archives/202373.php | accessdate =May 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in an editorial for ''[[The Washington Times]]'', Jason Greaves urged individuals to participate in the protest event on May 20.&lt;ref name="jasongreaves"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Greaves | first = Jason | title = Stand up for free speech May 20| work = [[The Washington Times]] | publisher = The Washington Times, LLC | date =May 13, 2010 | url =http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/may/13/stand-up-for-free-speech-may-20/ | accessdate = May 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greaves concluded, "Theo van Gogh was murdered for making a movie critical of Islam. 'South Park' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone are threatened with the same fate. They deserve our solidarity, and I will stand with them by hosting images of Muhammad on my own website. Please stand with us."&lt;ref name="jasongreaves" /&gt;

In a May 17, 2010 article in ''[[The Daily Bruin]]'', writer Tyler Dosaj noted that numbers of both supporters and critics of the protest movement were increasing: "The Facebook group is 35,000 strong.

But no one should be beaten or killed or imprisoned simply for speaking their mind or praying to one god as opposed to the other or none at all or getting on with the small business of living their life in peaceful fashion.

Second, each of the images forces the viewer to actively participate not simply in the creation of meaning but of actually constructing the image itself."&lt;ref name="andthewinneris" /&gt; There were two images in the position of [[runner-up]] – one was an artistic rendition of a [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|tobacco smoking pipe]].&lt;ref name="andthewinneris"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Gillespie | first =Nick|authorlink=Nick Gillespie |author2=[[Matt Welch]]  | title =And The Winner of The Everybody Draw Mohammad Contest is... | work =[[Reason (magazine)|Reason.com]]| publisher = Reason Magazine | date = May 20, 2010 | url =http://reason-contest.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html | accessdate = May 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction references [[surrealist]] artist [[René Magritte]], and includes the text, "This is not a pipe.

==Reception==

===Support===
The idea for the May 20 protest received support from [[Kathleen Parker]], an opinion columnist for ''[[The Washington Post]]'': "Americans love their free speech and have had enough of those who think they can dictate the limits of that fundamental right. [...] Draw to any heart's discontent. It's a free country. For now."&lt;ref name=kpfos/&gt; The idea also received support from prominent bloggers and bloggers on prominent websites, such as [[Michael C. Moynihan]] at ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]'' magazine's "Hit &amp; Run" blog, who encouraged his readers to send him their drawings.&lt;ref name="moynihan423"&gt;Moynihan, Michael C., [http://reason.com/blog/2010/04/23/first-annual-everybody-draw-mo "First Annual Everybody Draw Mohammad Day"], blog post, April 23, 2010, "Hit &amp; Run" blog, ''Reason'' magazine website. Retrieved April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Moynihan stated he planned to select some of his favorite depictions of Muhammad from the protest movement, and then add them to the Reason.com website.&lt;ref name="moye" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moynihan423" /&gt; Moynihan commented, "In the South Park episode that started all this, Buddha does lines of coke and there was an episode where Cartman started a Christian rock band that sang very homo-erotic songs. Yet there is one religious figure we can't make fun of. The point of the episode that started the controversy is that celebrities wanted Muhammad's power not to be ridiculed. How come non-Muslims aren't allowed to make jokes?"&lt;ref name="moye" /&gt; Moynihan posited that the decision of Comedy Central to enact [[self-censorship]] of the ''South Park'' episode would have the impact of worsening the situation.&lt;ref name="moye" /&gt;

"Indignation from those who claim the right to engage in criticism of religion is as important as the indignation that comes from the Muslim side," he told the  [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]] (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation).

[[Vebjørn Selbekk]], a Norwegian editor who was threatened in 2006 after he reprinted [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Danish cartoons of Mohammed]] in his publication, supported the May 20 protest.

===Criticism===
Law professor and blogger [[Ann Althouse]] rejected the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day idea because "depictions of Muhammad offend millions of Muslims who are no part of the violent threats."&lt;ref&gt;Althouse, Ann, [http://althouse.blogspot.com/2010/04/everybody-draw-mohammed-day-is-not-good.html "'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' is not a good idea."], blog post, April 24, 2010, "Althouse" blog. Retrieved April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Taranto]], writing in the "Best of the Web Today" column at ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', also objected to the idea, not only because depicting Mohammed "is inconsiderate of the sensibilities of others", but also because "it defines those others—Muslims—as being outside of our culture, unworthy of the courtesy we readily accord to insiders."&lt;ref&gt;Taranto, James, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703465204575208100160425826?mod=WSJ_Opinion_MIDDLETopOpinion "Everybody Burn the Flag/If we don't act like inconsiderate jerks, the terrorists will have won!"], opinion article, ''The Wall Street Journal'', April 26, 2010.

Franz Kruger, writing for the ''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]'', called Everybody Draw Mohammed Day a "silly Facebook initiative" and found "the undertone of a 'clash of civilisations'" in it "disturbing", noting that "it is clear that some feel great satisfaction at what they see as 'sticking it to the Muslims'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =  Kruger| first =Franz | title = Why draw the Prophet? | work =  [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] | date =May 28, 2010  | url =http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-05-28-why-draw-the-prophet | accessdate = May 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', which had itself published a controversial cartoon of Mohammed in its pages, distanced itself from the group, noting that it "claimed to be a protest against restrictions on freedom of speech and religious fanaticism, but had seemingly become a forum for venting Islamophobic sentiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Sapa | title = M&amp;G regrets cartoon offence over prophet | work = [[The Daily Dispatch]] | date = May 31, 2010 | url = http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=405490 | accessdate = June 11, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110615142819/http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=405490 | archivedate = June 15, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugo Rifkind]], writing for ''[[The Times]]'', called the Facebook initiative a "grubby project": "... there’s something here that makes me twitch.

But among the 13,000 pictures on the EDMD Facebook page, you have Mohammed as a dog in a veil, Mohammed as a pig and Mohammed as a monkey. That’s not resistance, but picking a fight.

In Pakistan, an editorial in ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', the country's oldest English-language newspaper, said that there was no doubt that the Facebook initiative "was in poor taste and deserving of strong condemnation," adding that it was "debatable whether freedom of expression should extend to material that is offensive to the sensibilities, traditions and beliefs of religious, ethnic or other communities." However, the editorial called the Lahore High Court's decision to block Facebook a "knee-jerk reaction," saying that, "many users feel, and rightly so, that they can decide for themselves what is or is not offensive, and choose not to access material that is repugnant to their beliefs," and that the block might "have played right into the hands of those who think nothing of displaying or publishing material that denigrates their beliefs. By reacting the way we do we only harm ourselves and, in the process, even become a subject of derision."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Staff |title=Facebook furore |work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=May 21, 2010 |url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/editorial/19-facebook-furore-150-hh-09 |accessdate=May 30, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524012334/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/editorial/19-facebook-furore-150-hh-09 |archivedate=May 24, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===
The protest movement and incidents surrounding the [[censorship]] of the ''South Park'' episode were discussed on the [[National Public Radio]] program, ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'', where commentators including [[Ross Douthat]] analyzed the phenomenon of Norris withdrawing from the cartoon.&lt;ref name="douthat"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Douthat  | first = Ross |authorlink=Ross Douthat | title =  You Can't Portray Muhammad On TV| work = [[Talk of the Nation]]  | publisher = [[National Public Radio]] | date =April 26, 2010  | url =https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126283217  | accessdate = May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephanie Gutmann of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that she had joined the Facebook group, and commented that if the [[2010 Times Square car bomb attempt]] was found to be related to the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[200 (South Park)|200]]", "this sort of protest will be more important than ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Gutmann | first =  Stephanie   | title = Facebook group says make May 20 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'  |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | date = May 3, 2010 | url = http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/stephaniegutmann/100037736/facebook-group-says-make-may-20-everybody-draw-mohammed-day/ | accessdate = May 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Faster Times]]'', journalist Noah Lederman noted that Norris' cartoon, "was her way of supporting the show’s creators and the First Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lederman | first = Noah  | title =South Park, Mohammed, and the First Amendment  | work =[[The Faster Times]] | publisher = thefastertimes.com | date = May 4, 2010 | url =http://www.isisiraq.com/south-park-mohammed-and-the-first-amendment/  | accessdate =May 5, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing for ''[[Financial Times]]'', John Lloyd commented on the decision by Norris to withdraw from the protest movement and noted, "Molly Norris proposed a 'let’s everyone draw Mohammed day' – then, apparently appalled by her own audacity, backed quickly away."&lt;ref name="johnlloyd"&gt;{{Cite news| last =  Lloyd| first =John | title = Hard men and high drama: life imitating art? | work =  [[Financial Times]] | date =May 8, 2010  | url =http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/bbd083d6-595c-11df-99ba-00144feab49a.html  | accessdate = May 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[Religion Dispatches]]'', Austin Dacey compared the protest movement to [[Martin Luther]], stating, "Forget the ''South Park'' dust up; forget Everybody Draw Muhammad Day. If you want to see truly shocking anti-religious cartoons, you have to go back to the sixteenth century. Near the end of Luther’s life, his propaganda campaign against Rome grew increasingly vitriolic and his language grotesquely pungent."&lt;ref name="austindacey"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Dacey  | first = Austin  | title =  Satire is Religion – The debate over cartoons and prophets is not just about free of speech; it’s about freedom of religion.| work = Religion Dispatches | publisher =www.religiondispatches.org | date = May 12, 2010 | url = http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/culture/2561/satire_is_religion/ | accessdate = May 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dacey argued, "The debate over cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad is often framed as a clash between free speech and religious attitudes. But it is just as much a clash between ''conflicting'' religious attitudes, and the freedom at stake is not only freedom of expression but freedom of religion. For while Luther was surely engaging in offensive speech, he was also exercising a right of freedom of conscience, which included the right to dissent from Catholic orthodoxy."&lt;ref name="austindacey" /&gt;

In an analysis of the protest movement for the ''[[Daily Bruin]]'', journalist Jordan Manalastas commented, "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day is a chance to reinstate offense and sincerity to their proper place, freed from terror or silence. ... The proper (and, at the risk of looking [[jingoistic]], American) way to combat bad speech is with better speech. To silence and be silenced are the refuge of cowards."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Manalastas | first = Jordan  | title =Cartoonist criticized for creating ‘Everybody Draw Mohammed Day’ should have defended her right to First Amendment  | work = [[Daily Bruin]]  |publisher = www.dailybruin.com, [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date = May 17, 2010 | url =http://www.dailybruin.com/articles/2010/5/17/cartoonist-criticized-creating-everybody-draw-moha/  | accessdate = May 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an analysis of the protest movement for ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]] was critical of the concept of "mocking Muhammad," writing, "... these two camps – the Muhammad-knockers and the Muslim offence-takers – are locked in a deadly embrace. Islamic extremists need Western depictions of Muhammad as evidence that there is a new crusade against Islam, while the Muhammad-knockers need the [[flag-burning]], street-stomping antics of the extremists as evidence that their defence of the Enlightenment is a risky, important business."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = O'Neill | first = Brendan | title =Mocking Muhammad: a shallow Enlightenment  | work =[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked magazine]] | publisher = www.spiked-online.com | date =May 19, 2010  | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/8894#.WDk70orQeUk | accessdate = November 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[editorial cartoonist]]s quoted by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blogger Michael Cavna were critical of the Draw Mohammed Day idea or declined to participate, although all supported the right of cartoonists to depict Mohammed if they chose to.&lt;ref name=Cavna20May&gt;Michael Cavna, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/05/their_turn_12_top_cartoonists.html THEIR TURN: 12 top cartoonists offer their take on 'Draw Muhammad Day'], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blog ''Comics Riff'' (May 20, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  The president of the [[Association of American Editorial Cartoonists]] opposed involvement because, "something like that can be too easily co-opted by interest groups who, I suspect, have an agenda that goes beyond a simple defense of free expression."&lt;ref name=Cavna20May/&gt;  Other cartoonists quoted in the article called the event, "childish and needlessly provocative," or demurred because they dislike, "choreographed punditry."&lt;ref name=Cavna20May/&gt;

He also defended [[The First Amendment|the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution]] in the way that it's an important right of all Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalexperts.org/comment-analysis/drawing-the-prophet-muhammad-should-not-be-an-issue|title=Drawing the Prophet Muhammad is not the issue|author=Tarek Kahlaoui|date=May 17, 2010|publisher=Global Expert Finder|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threat on Molly Norris's life, forced into hiding==
On July 11, 2010, it was reported that the Yemeni-American al-Qaeda cleric [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] had put Molly Norris on a hitlist. In the English version of the [[al-Qaeda]] magazine  ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]],'' Al-Awlaki wrote, "The medicine prescribed by the Messenger of Allah is the execution of those involved," and was quoted as saying, &lt;blockquote&gt;The large number of participants makes it easier for us because there are more targets to choose from in addition to the difficulty of the government offering all of them special protection ...

[[File:Fall protection allows his men to go home at the end of the day.webm|thumb|A video on the value of fall protection measures]]
'''Fall protection''' is the use of controls designed to protect personnel from [[Falling (accident)|falling]] or in the event they do fall, to stop them without causing severe injury. Typically, fall protection is implemented when working at height, but may be relevant when working near any edge, such as near a pit or hole, or performing work on a steep surface.

There are four generally accepted categories of fall protection: fall elimination, fall prevention, [[fall arrest]] and administrative controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=J. Nigel|title=Introduction to fall protection|date=2011|publisher=[[American Society of Safety Engineers]]|isbn=9781885581587|page=28|edition=4th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the US Department of Labor, falls account for 8% of all work-related trauma injuries leading to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bickrest|first1=Ed|title=Fall Protection: Failure is Not an Option|url=http://ehstoday.com/ppe/fall-protection/falls-remain-occupational-hazard-0309|website=EHS Today|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal statutes, standards and regulations in the United States pertaining to the requirements for employers to provide fall protection are administered by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duty to have fall protection. 1926.501|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10757|website=Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration|publisher=United States Dept. of Labor|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Falls in the workplace ==
Falls from elevations were the fourth leading cause of workplace death from 1980 through 1994, with an average of 540 deaths per year accounting for 10% of all occupational fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2000-116/|title=Worker Deaths by Falls: A Summary of Surveillance Findings and Investigative Case Reports|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|page=xi|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falls are a concern for oil and gas workers, many of whom must work high on a [[derrick]].  A study of falls over the period 2005–2014 found that in 86% of fatal falls studied, fall protection was required by regulation, but it was not used, was used improperly, or the equipment failed.  Many of the fatalities were because, although the workers were wearing harnesses, they neglected to attach them to an anchor point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mason|first=Krystal L.|last2=Retzer|first2=Kyla D.|last3=Hill|first3=Ryan|last4=Lincoln|first4=Jennifer M.|date=2017-01-01|title=Occupational Fatalities Resulting from Falls in the Oil and Gas Extraction Industry, United States, 2005–2014|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6616a2.htm|journal=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]]|language=en-us|volume=66|issue=16|pages=417–421|doi=10.15585/mmwr.mm6616a2|issn=0149-2195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of fall protection ==
In most work-at-height environments, multiple fall protection measures are used concurrently.

=== Fall elimination ===
Fall [[Hazard elimination|elimination]] is often the preferred way of providing fall protection.  This entails finding ways of completing tasks without working at heights.

=== Fall prevention ===
{{main|Fall prevention}}
* Fall guarding is the use of guard rails or other barricades to prevent a person from falling. These barricades are placed near an edge where a fall-hazard can occur, or to surround a weak surface (such as a skylight on a roof) which may break when stepped on.
* Fall restraint is a class of [[personal protective equipment]] to prevent persons who are in a fall hazard area from falling, e.g., fall restraint lanyards. Typically, fall restraint will physically prevent a worker from approaching an edge.

=== Fall arrest ===
{{main article|Fall arrest}}
Fall arrest is the form of fall protection that stops a person who has fallen.

=== Administrative controls ===
[[Administrative controls]] are used along with other measures, but they do not physically prevent a worker from going over an edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fall Protection|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10758|website=United States Department of Labor|publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of administrative controls include placing a safety observer or warning line near an edge, or enforcing a safety policy which trains workers and requires them to adhere to other fall protection measures, or prohibiting any un-restrained worker from approaching an edge.

[[File:Logo circular.jpg|thumb|GalileoMobile logo]]

'''GalileoMobile''' is a non-profit, itinerant, science education initiative that brings modern astronomy closer to young people around the world, with emphasis in regions that have little or no access to other outreach actions. The initiative was created in late 2008 inspired by the [[International Year of Astronomy|2009 International Year of Astronomy]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomy2009.org/globalprojects/specialprojects/mobile/ IYA2009 Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently run by a group of astronomers, educators, and science communicators.

The team organises workshops for teachers and hands-on astronomy-related activities for students in schools and villages to foster a will of learning and critical thinking through the exciting wonders of our Universe, and to inspire a sense of global citizenship "under the same sky" by promoting a cultural exchange. To encourage follow-up activities GalileoMobile also donates to each school visited a [[Galileoscope]] or [http://kimigali.jp/index-e.html You are Galileo!] telescope, a copy of our [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-resources/galileomobile-handbooks Handbook of activities], a [[Universe Awareness|UNAWE]] Earthball, and other educational material.

In GalileoMobile's first project the team travelled across the high plateau of the Andes in the north of [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-chibolpe2009 Chile, Bolivia, and Peru] during October and November 2009. Since then, GalileoMobile has been to [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-bolivia2012 Bolivia (2012)], [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-india2012 India (2012)], [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-uganda2013 Uganda (2013)], [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-brabo2014 Bolivia and Brazil (2014)], and [http://www.galileo-mobile.org/galileomobile-expeditions/galileomobile-colombia2014 Colombia (2014)]. Inspired by our expeditions, some of our team members have also carried out activities in Portugal, Nepal, United States, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Guatemala.

In 2015, GalileoMobile embarked on yet another astronomical adventure called [http://www.constellationproject.org Constellation]. This project brings together schools from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru to create a South American network of schools committed to bringing the exciting world of astronomy closer to their students. The students were able to explore the wonders of the Universe by taking part in “Space Exploration”, a series of astronomical outreach activities created especially for this project. Through the network, they will be able to share their passion for the sky with peers from all across South America. Their schools will also benefit from the long-term support of GalileoMobile when independently organising astronomical outreach activities in the years to come. The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] has decided to officially endorse Constellation as a Major Cosmic Light programme of the [[International Year of Light|International Year of Light 2015]] and the [http://www.astro4dev.org Office for Astronomical Development] has decided to officially sponsor about 30% of the entire project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro4dev.org/blog/2015/03/11/overview-of-the-project-52/|title=Overview of the project {{!}} IAU Office of Astronomy for Development|website=www.astro4dev.org|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gebelein predynastic mummies''' are six [[mummy|naturally mummified]] bodies, dating to approximately [[35th century BC|3400&amp;nbsp;BC]] from the [[Predynastic Egypt|Late Predynastic period]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. They were the first complete predynastic bodies to be discovered. The well-preserved bodies were excavated at the end of the nineteenth century by [[E. A. Wallis Budge|Wallis Budge]], the British Museum Keeper for Egyptology, from shallow sand graves near [[Gebelein]] (today, [[Naga el-Gherira]]&lt;ref name=Bard1999 /&gt;) in the Egyptian desert.

Budge excavated all the bodies from the same grave site. Two were identified as male and one as female, with the others being of undetermined gender. The bodies were given to the [[British Museum]] in 1900. Some grave-goods were documented at the time of excavation as "pots and flints", however they were not passed on to the British Museum and their whereabouts remain unknown. Three of the bodies were found with coverings of different types (reed matting, palm fibre and an animal skin), which still remain with the bodies. The bodies were found in foetal positions lying on their left sides.

Since 1901, the first body excavated has remained on display in the British Museum. This body was originally nicknamed Ginger due to his red hair; this nickname is no longer officially used as part of recent ethical policies for human remains.

==Excavation==

In 1895 and 1896 the ruins at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], [[Naqada|Tukh]], [[Hierakonpolis]] and [[Gebelein]] were excavated. In 1892 [[Jacques de Morgan]], Director of Antiquities in Egypt, proved that pottery found at Abydos and Nakadah pre-dated the dynastic period, stimulating interest by many European Archaeologists. As each excavation was completed, local Egyptian residents would continue to search the sites for remains. In 1895 [[E. A. Wallis Budge]], on behalf of the British Museum, procured inscribed coffins and funerary furniture from the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]] tombs at [[Al-Barshah]] by working with the Egyptian Service of Antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Budge|1920|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budge started purchasing predynastic finds from the locals including bowls, spear and arrow heads, carved flint and bone figures and partial human remains (described as chiefly bones without skin or flesh remaining).&lt;ref name=Budge359/&gt;

In 1896, Budge was approached by a resident of Gebelein who claimed to have found more mummies. Budge was taken to the bodies, and he immediately recognized them as from the predynastic period and the first complete pre-dynastic bodies identified. He began excavations and a total of six mummified bodies were removed from shallow sand graves at Baḥr Bila Mâ (''Waterless River'') located at the eastern slopes of the north-most hill at Gebelein.&lt;ref name=Bard1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Budge359&gt;{{harvnb|Budge|1920|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only grave goods were a pot found with the female adult body and partial remains of wicker, fur and linen with the other bodies.&lt;ref name=budge1920/&gt; In the predynastic period bodies were usually buried naked and sometimes loosely wrapped. In such a burial, when the body is covered in warm sand, the environmental conditions mean that most of the water in the body is quickly evaporated or drained away, meaning that the corpse is naturally dried and preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1996|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was widely used in the pre-dynastic Egyptian period, before artificial [[mummification]] was developed.&lt;ref name=bmdb&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=117645&amp;partid=1 |title=Human mummy EA 32751 (collection database record) |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The natural mummification that occurred with these dry sand burials may have led to the original Egyptian belief in an after-death survival and started the tradition of leaving food and implements for an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawson|Gray|1968|p=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All bodies were in similar flexed positions lying on their left sides with knees raised up towards their chin. In comparison, most bodies excavated from Egypt dating to the predynastic period are in a similar position, however at [[Merimda Beni Salama]]&lt;ref&gt;Merimda Beni Salama is a [[Neolithic]] settlement 60 km North of [[Cairo]], see {{citation |last=Hawass |first=Zahi |year=1988 |title=Chronology, Sediments, and Subsistence at Merimda Beni Salama |last2=Hassan |first2=Fekri A |last3=Gautier |first3=Achilles |journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology |volume= 74 |issn=0307-5133 |oclc=480070236|pages=31–38 |doi=10.2307/3821745}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[El-Amra]] bodies were found on their right sides. From the time these bodies were buried up until the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] period, the dead were laid on their sides. After this period they were buried on their backs (dorsal position), and from the [[Fifth Dynasty]] the bodies were always fully extended.&lt;ref name=dgside&gt;{{harvnb|Dawson|Gray|1968|pp=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological interest in Gebelien started in the early 18th century and was included in [[Benoît de Maillet]]'s ''Description de l'Egypte''.&lt;ref name=Mascrier1735 &gt;{{citation | last1=Mascrier | first1=Jean Baptiste Le | year=1735 | title=Description de l'Egypte | last2=de Maillet | first2=Benoit | publisher=chez Louis Genneay }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site includes the remains from a temple to the [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] [[Hathor]] with a number of [[cartouche]]s on mud bricks and a royal [[stela]] from the [[2nd Dynasty]] and [[3rd Dynasty]]. Later period finds include 400 Demotic and Greek [[ostraca]] from a 2nd–1st century BC mercenary garrison. As well as official excavations, many artefacts from the site were traded on the antiquities market and can be found in the museums of Turin, Cairo, Berlin, Lyons and the British Museum.&lt;ref name=Bard1999&gt;{{citation | last1=Bard | first1=Kathryn A. | year=1999 | title=Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt | last2=Shubert | first2=Steven Blake | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-18589-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNdgScxtirYC  | page=338 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The bodies were buried in separate shallow graves, placed in the [[fetal position]] (knees raised towards their heads), which was the most common form for Egyptian burials of the time.&lt;ref name=dgside/&gt;

In 1967 a series of X-rays and photographs of all mummified bodies in the British Museum's Egyptian Antiquities collection provided a detailed analysis for the mummies from the Gebelein excavations.  The findings are summarized below:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawson|Gray|1968|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first body excavated had red hair; this led to the nickname of "Ginger" by curators and later by the public.&lt;ref name=bmdb/&gt;&lt;ref name=auto-gt-2007 &gt;{{citation | year=2007 | first=Cynthia Clayton |last=Ochterbeck| title=Michelin Green Guide Great Britain | edition=5 | publisher=Michelin Apa Publications | isbn=978-1-906261-08-5 | page=327 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jalf4tSUb68C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dailymail&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-417396/Hi-Mummy-Im-home.html |title=Hi Mummy I'm home |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |first=Robert |last=Hardman|date=20 November 2006 |accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Human Tissue Act 2004]], the British Museum has developed policies for ethical treatment of human remains and no longer uses this nickname.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/statements/human_remains.aspx |title=Human remains |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=15 June 2010 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uFCXvc62?url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/statements/human_remains.aspx |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Gebelein Man===
In November 2012 it was revealed that EA 32751 (Gebelein Man) had probably been murdered. A CAT scan of the mummified body taken at the [[Cromwell Hospital]] in London showed that Gebelein Man was aged about 18 to 20 at the time of his death and was well-muscled. Under his left shoulder blade, the scan revealed a puncture to the body; the murder weapon was used with such force that it slightly damaged the shoulder blade, but shattered the rib beneath it and penetrated the lung. It was believed that the injury was caused by a copper blade or flint knife at least 12&amp;nbsp;cm in length and 2&amp;nbsp;cm wide. Daniel Antoine, the [[British Museum]]'s expert on human remains, believes that Gebelein Man had been taken by surprise by the attack as there were no defense wounds.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'' 16 November 2012 (pg 10)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20353934|title=British Museum exhibit Gebelein Man died 'violent death'|date=16 November 2012|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition history==

The mummies were acquired by the [[British Museum]] in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;The registration number ''1900,1018.1'' shows the body logged as received on 18 October 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; One male adult body, museum number EA 32751 (then nicknamed "Ginger"), went on display in 1901, and  was the earliest mummified body seen by the public. Apart from maintenance, it has been on continuous display in the same gallery since 1901.&lt;ref name=CS134408841 &gt;{{Cite news|title=Egyptian Antiquities At The British Museum |date=9 April 1902 |page=8 |url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/keywordsearch.arc?queryKeywords=Egyptian+Antiquities+At+The+British+Museum |work=The Times |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gu1987/&gt; In 1987 the body was temporarily taken off display for restoration and a female mummified body replaced it. She was nicknamed "Gingerella" even though the body has long brown hair.&lt;ref name=gu1987&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=The Guardian (London)|date=14 October 1987|title=Ancient Egyptian given new lease of life |first=Maev|last=Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gingerella/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=The Associated Press|date=9 October 1987|title=British Museum Overhauls Popular Mummy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The male body, EA 32751,  is displayed in a reconstructed sand grave in the British Museum in room 64 and case 15. Though Budge wrote of "pots and flints" with the body, these artefacts were not acquired by the museum. A number of Egyptian grave goods taken from similar graves of the period are instead used in the display.&lt;ref name=bmover&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/p/predynastic_egyptian_man.aspx |title=Predynastic Egyptian Man (highlights) |publisher=British Museum |date=14 May 2010 |accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bmdb/&gt; The grave goods include black-topped clay pots that were typical of the predynastic period through to [[Naqada II]], and plain and buff coloured pots and bowls typical of slightly later periods. There are also slate palettes, hard stone vessels and flint knives which would be associated with more elaborate burials of the [[historical period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strudwick|2006|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I unpacked the first man we had taken out of his grave at [[Gebel&amp;ecirc;n]] one Saturday in March 1900, in the presence of [[David Lindsay, 27th Earl of Crawford|Lord Crawford]] and the Principal Librarian, and when it was laid on a table it was as complete as when I first saw it at Gebel&amp;ecirc;n. But when it was examined again on the following Monday morning it was discovered that the top joint of one of the forefingers was missing, and it has, to my knowledge never been found since. The body was exhibited at once in the First Egyptian Room, and for the first time the British public saw a neolithic Egyptian.|[[E. A.

Of the other five bodies, only the female adult, given museum number EA 32752, has been exhibited.  In 1997-8 the body was part of a tour to Rome as part of the [[List of palazzi in Italy#Rome and Vatican City|Palazzo Ruspoli]], ''Ancient Faces'' exhibition.

A '''gospel harmony''' is an attempt to compile the [[canonical gospels]] of the [[Christian]] [[New Testament]] into a single account.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; This may take the form either of a single, merged [[narrative]], or a tabular format with one column for each gospel, technically known as a '''synopsis''', although the word ''harmony'' is often used for both.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;

Harmonies are constructed for a variety of purposes: to provide a straightforward devotional text for parishioners, to create a readable and accessible piece of literature for the general public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Averitt|first1=Neil|title=The Single Gospel|date=2015|publisher=Wipf and Stock|isbn=978-1-4982-2158-0|pages=xix-xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish a scholarly [[Chronology of Jesus|chronology of events]] in the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life of Jesus]] as depicted in the canonical gospels, or to better understand how the accounts relate to each other.&lt;ref name=Cox18/&gt;

Among academics, the construction of harmonies has always been favoured by more conservative scholars.{{who?|date=August 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Students of [[higher criticism]] see the divergences between the gospel accounts as reflecting the construction of traditions by the [[Early centers of Christianity|early Christian communities]].&lt;ref name=Cox1&gt;{{Citation | first = Steven L | last = Cox | year = 2007 | title = Harmony of the Gospels | publisher = B&amp;H | ISBN = 0-8054-9444-8 | pages = 1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among modern academics, attempts to construct a single story have largely been abandoned in favour of laying out the accounts in [[Parallel passage|parallel columns for comparison]], to allow critical study of the differences between them.&lt;ref name="Christianity, Vol 2005 page 39"&gt;{{Citation | title = The Encyclopedia of Christianity | volume = 4 | publisher = Eerdmans | year = 2005 | page = 39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known harmony is the ''[[Diatessaron]]'' by [[Tatian]] in the [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]] and variations based on the ''Diatessaron'' continued to appear in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name= Aune190&gt;{{Citation | title = The Westminster Dictionary of New Testament and Early Christian Literature | last = Aune | first = David Edward | author-link = David Edward Aune | date = Nov 30, 2003 | ISBN = 0-66421917-9 | page = 190}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RobS28/&gt; The 16th century witnessed a major increase in the introduction of gospel harmonies and the parallel column structure became widespread.&lt;ref name= Cox6 /&gt; At this time visual representations also started appearing, depicting the life of Christ in terms of a "pictorial gospel harmony", and the trend continued into the 19th–20th centuries.&lt;ref name=corby/&gt;&lt;ref name =Dolkart70&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=q_U3AQAAIAAJ | first = James | last = Tissot | title = The Life of Christ : the complete set of 350 watercolors | editor1-first = Judith F | editor1-last = Dolkart | editor2-first = James | editor2-last = Jacques | year = 2009 | ISBN = 0-87273164-2 | pages = 70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A gospel harmony is an attempt to collate the Christian canonical gospels into a single account.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; Harmonies are constructed by some writers in order to make the gospel story available to a wider audience, both religious and secular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Averitt|first1=Neil|title=The Single Gospel|date=2015|publisher=Wipf and Stock|isbn=978-1-4982-2158-0|pages=xix-xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harmonies can be studied by scholars to establish a coherent chronology of the events depicted in the four canonical gospels in the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life of Jesus]], to better understand how the accounts relate to each other, and to critically evaluate their differences.&lt;ref name=Cox18/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christianity, Vol 2005 page 39"/&gt;

The terms ''harmony'' and ''synopsis'' have been used to refer to several different approaches to consolidating the canonical gospels.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;  Technically, a "harmony" weaves together sections of scripture into a single narrative, merging the four gospels. There are four main types of harmony: ''radical'', ''synthetic'', ''sequential'' and ''parallel''.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; By contrast, a "synopsis", much like a parallel harmony, justaposes similar texts or accounts in parallel format, synchronized by time, while preserving their individual identity, usually in columns.&lt;ref name=Cox3&gt;Steven L. Cox, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' B&amp;H Publishing {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} pages 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Harmonies may also take a visual form and be undertaken to create narratives for artistic purposes, as in the creation of picture compositions depicting the life of Christ.&lt;ref name=corby/&gt;

The oldest approach to harmonizing consists of merging the stories into a single narrative, producing a text longer than any individual gospel.&lt;ref name=Cox18&gt;Steven L. Cox, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' B&amp;H Publishing {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} page 18&lt;/ref&gt; This creates the most straightforward and detailed account, and one that is likely to be most accessible to non-academic users, such as lay churchgoers or people who are reading the gospels as a work of literature or philosophy.

There are, however, difficulties in the creation of a consolidated narrative. As [[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]] points out, it is impossible to construct a single account from the four gospels without changing at least some parts of the individual accounts.&lt;ref name="John Barton 2013 page 59"&gt;John Barton, ''The Old Testament: Canon Literature and Theology Collected Essays of John Barton'' (Ashgate Publishing, 2013) page 59.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One challenge with any form of harmonizing is that events are sometimes described in a different order in different accounts – the [[Synoptic Gospels]], for instance, describe Jesus overturning tables in the Temple at Jerusalem in the last week of his life, whereas the Gospel of John records a counterpart event only towards the beginning of Jesus's ministry. Harmonists must either choose which time they think is correct, or conclude that separate events are described. Lutheran theologian [[Andreas Osiander]], for instance, proposed in ''Harmonia evangelica'' (1537) that Jesus must have been crowned with thorns twice, and that there were three separate episodes of [[Jesus and the money changers|cleansing of the Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham N. Stanton|Graham Stanton]], ''Gospel Truth? New Light on Jesus and the Gospels'' (HarperCollins, 1995) page 8; [[John S. Kloppenborg|John S. Kloppenborg Verbin]], "Is There a New Paradigm?", in Horrell, Tuckett (eds), ''Christology, Controversy, and Community: New Testament Essays in Honour of David R. Catchpole'' (BRILL, 2000), page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, commentators have long noted that the individual gospels are not written in a rigorously chronological format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Christological  Catechism (quoting Augustine)|last=Fitzmyer|first=Joseph A.|publisher=Paulist Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Introduction to Matthew," in The Expositor's Bible Commentary vol. VIII|last=Carson|first=D,A.|publisher=Zondervan|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=38-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that an event can be described as falling at two different times and still be the same event, so that the substantive details can be properly brought together in a harmony, although the harmonist will still have the task of deciding which of the two times is more probable.

A less common but more serious difficulty arises if the gospels diverge in their substantive description of an event.  An example is the incident involving the centurion whose servant is healed at a distance. In the Gospel of Matthew the centurion comes to Jesus in person;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|8:8–9|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Luke version he sends Jewish elders.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|7:6–8|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these accounts are clearly describing the same event, the harmonist must decide which is the more accurate description or else devise a composite account.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Allan Powell]], ''Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998), page 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gregg |last=Zegarelli |title=ONE: The Unified Gospel of Jesus |publisher=OUG Press |year=2006|isbn=978-0978990602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern academic view, based on the broadly accepted principle that Matthew and Luke were written using Mark as a source, seeks to explain the differences between the texts in terms of this process of composition. For example, Mark describes John the Baptist as preaching the forgiveness of sins, a detail which is dropped by Matthew, perhaps in the belief that the forgiveness of sins was exclusive to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Watson (theologian)|Francis Watson]], "Must the Gospels Agree?" in Stuart G. Hall, ''Jesus Christ Today: Studies of Christology in Various Contexts'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2009) page 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern popularizing view, on the other hand, while acknowledging these difficulties, deemphasizes their importance. This view suggests that the divergences in the gospels are a relatively small part of the whole, and that the accounts show a great deal of overall similarity.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; The divergences can therefore be sufficiently discussed in footnote in the course of a consolidated narrative, and need not stand in the way of conveying a better overall view of the life of Jesus&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; or of making this material more accessible to a wider readership.

To illustrate the concept of parallel harmony, a simple example of a "synopsis fragment" is shown here, consisting of just four episodes from the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven L. Cox, Kendell H Easley, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} pages 207–211&lt;/ref&gt; A more comprehensive parallel harmony appears in a section below.

==Early Church and Middle Ages==
[[Image:LondonCanonTables.JPG|upright|thumb|250px|A 6–7th-century use of the [[Eusebian Canons]] to organize the contents of the gospels in the [[London Canon Tables]].]]
[[Tatian]]'s influential ''[[Diatessaron]]'', which dates to about AD 160, was perhaps the very first harmony.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aune190/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Westminster Dictionary of New Testament and Early Christian Literature'' by David Edward Aune (Nov 30, 2003) {{ISBN|0664219179}} pages 127 and 211&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Diatessaron'' reduced the number of verses in the four gospels from 3,780 to 2,769 without missing any event of teaching in the life of Jesus from any of the gospels.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; Some scholars believe Tatian may have drawn on one or more noncanonical gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Bart Ehrman, Zlatko Plese, ''The Apocryphal Gospels: Texts and Translations'' (Oxford University Press, 2011) page 231.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gospel of the Ebionites]], composed about the same time, is believed to have been a gospel harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Cameron, ''The Other Gospels: Non-canonical Gospel Texts'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1982) page 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations based on the ''Diatessaron'' continued to appear in the Middle Ages, e.g. Codex Sangallensis (based on the 6th century [[Codex Fuldensis]]) dates to 830 and has a Latin column based on the [[Vulgate]] and an [[Old High German]] column that often resembles the ''Diatessaron'', although errors frequently appear within it.&lt;ref name=RobS28/&gt; The Liege harmony in the [[Limburgish language|Limburg dialect]] (Liege University library item 437) is a key [[Western Church|Western]] source of the ''Diatessaron'' and dates to 1280, although published much later.&lt;ref name=RobS28/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krans188/&gt; The two extant recensions of the Diatessaron in Medieval Italian are the single manuscript Venetian from the 13th or 14th century and the 26 manuscript Tuscan from the 14–15th century.&lt;ref name=RobS28&gt;''Tatian and the Jewish Scriptures'' by Robert F. Shedinger (Jan 1, 2002) {{ISBN|9042910429}} pages 28–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Krans188&gt;''Patristic and Text-Critical Studies'' by Jan Krans and Joseph Verheyden (Dec 31, 2011) {{ISBN|9004192891}} pages 188–190&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century [[Ammonius of Alexandria (Christian)|Ammonius of Alexandria]] developed the forerunner of modern synopsis (perhaps based on the ''Diatessaron'') as the [[Ammonian Sections]] in which he started with the text of Matthew and copied along parallel events.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Erwin41&gt;''Encyclopedia Christianity: v. 4'' by Erwin Fahlbusch (1 Jul 2004) {{ISBN|0802824161}} page 41&lt;/ref&gt; There are no extant copies of the harmony of Ammonius and it is only known from a single reference in the letter of [[Eusebius]] to Carpianus.&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt; In the letter Eusebius also discusses his own approach, i.e. the [[Eusebian Canons]] in which the texts of the gospels are shown in parallel to help comparison among the four gospels.&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt;

In the 5th century, [[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote extensively on the subject in his book ''[[Harmony of the Gospels (Augustine)|Harmony of the Gospels]]''.&lt;ref name=Lancel &gt;''Augustine through the ages: an encyclopedia'' by John C. Cavadini 1999 {{ISBN|0-8028-3843-X}} page 132&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine viewed the variations in the gospel accounts in terms of the different focuses of the authors on Jesus: Matthew on royalty, Mark on humanity, Luke on priesthood and John on divinity.&lt;ref name=Tuckett38 &gt;''Christology, Controversy and Community'' by David G. Horell and Christopher M. Tuckett (8 Aug 2000) {{ISBN|9004116796}} pages 37–40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clement of Llanthony]]'s ''[[Unum ex Quatuor]]'' (''One from Four'') was considered an improvement on previous canons at the time,{{sfnp|Smalley|1981|p=250}} although modern scholars sometimes opine that no major advances beyond Augustine emerged on the topic until the 15th century.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] harmonies based on the principles of the ''Diatessaron'' continued to appear, e.g. the Liege harmony by Plooij in [[Middle Dutch]], and the Pepysian harmony in [[Middle English]].&lt;ref name=Krans188/&gt;&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt; The Pepysian harmony (Magdalene college, Cambridge, item Pepys 2498) dates to about 1400 and its name derives from having been owned by [[Samuel Pepys]].&lt;ref name=Krans188/&gt;

==15th–20th centuries==
[[File:Branteghem Gospel harmony Antwerp 1537.JPG|upright|thumb|250px|The cover of Branteghem's 1537 visual gospel harmony, [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref name=Celeste2/&gt;]]
In the 15th and the 16th centuries some new approaches to harmony began to appear, e.g. [[Jean Gerson]] produced a harmony which gave priority to the [[Gospel of John]].&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt;. [[Cornelius Jansen (Bishop of Ghent)]] also published his harmony (1549), focusing on the four gospels and even referring to the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;ref&gt;François, W. (2012). Augustine and the Golden Age of Biblical Scholarship in Louvain (1550-1650). In: Gordon B., McLean M. (Eds.), bookseries: Library of the Written Word, vol: 20, Shaping the Bible in the Reformation: Books, Scholars and Their Readers in the Sixteenth Century. Leiden: Brill, 235-289, on  252.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand [[John Calvin]]'s approach focused on the three synoptic Gospels, and excluded the Gospel of John.
&lt;ref&gt;''John Calvin And the Printed Book'' by Jean François Gilmont (Nov 30, 2005) {{ISBN|1931112568}} page 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Harmony of the Gospels: Matthew, Mark, and Luke'' by John Calvin, David W. Torrance,(Jul 17, 1995) {{ISBN|0802808026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time visual representations had also started appearing, for instance, the 15th-century artist [[Lieven de Witte]] produced a set of about 200 woodcut images that depicted the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' in terms of a "pictorial gospel harmony" which then appeared in Willem van Branteghem's harmony published in [[Antwerp]] in 1537.&lt;ref name=corby&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=C8vYRVoqzf4C&amp;pg=PA398#v=snippet&amp;q=gospel%20harmony&amp;f=false Seeing Beyond the Word: Visual Arts and the Calvinist Tradition]'' by Paul Corby Finney 1999 {{ISBN|080283860X}} page 398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Celeste2/&gt; The importance of imagery is reflected in the title of Branteghem's well known work: ''The Life of Jesus Christ Skillfully Portrayed in Elegant Pictures Drawn from the Narratives of the Four Evangelists''&lt;ref name=Celeste2&gt;''The Authority of the Word: Reflecting on Image and Text in Northern Europe, 1400–1700'' by Celeste Brusati, Karl A. E. Enenkel and Walter S. Melion (Nov 2011) {{ISBN|9004215158}} pages 2–6&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century witnessed a major increase in the introduction of gospel harmonies. In this period the ''parallel column structure'' became widespread, partly in response to the rise of [[biblical criticism]].&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; This new format was used to emphasize the trustworthiness of the gospels. It is not clear who produced the very first parallel harmony, but [[Gerhard Mercator]]'s 1569 system is a well-known example.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sandy35&gt;''What Have They Done to the Bible?: A History of Modern Biblical Interpretation'' by John Sandys-Wunsch (20 Aug 2005) {{ISBN|0814650287}} page 35&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of content and quality, [[Johann Jacob Griesbach]]'s 1776 synopsis was a notable case.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sandy35/&gt;

At the same time, the rise of modern biblical criticism was instrumental in the decline of the traditional apologetic gospel harmony. The Enlightenment writer, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], observed:

{{quote|Oh that most excellent Harmony, which can only reconcile two contradictory reports, both stemming from the evangelists, by inventing a third report, not a syllable of which is to be found in any individual evangelist!&lt;ref&gt;Gotthold Ephraim Lessing Werke, 8.51-52, cited in [[Francis Watson (theologian)|Francis Watson]], ''Gospel Writing: A Canonical Perspective'' (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2013), page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

W. G. Rushbrooke's 1880 ''Synopticon'' is at times considered a turning point in the history of the synopsis, as it was based on [[Markan priority]], i.e. the assumption that the Gospel of Mark was the first to be written.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; Thirteen years later, [[John Broadus]] used historical accounts to assign priorities in his harmony, while previous approaches had used feasts as the major milestones for dividing the life of Christ.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;

Towards the end of the 19th century, after extensive travels and study in the Middle East, [[James Tissot]] produced a set of [[commons:Life of Jesus|350 watercolors which depicted]] the [[Life of Christ in art|life of Christ]] as a visual gospel harmony.&lt;ref name=Dolkart70/&gt; Tissot synthesized the four gospels into a singular narrative with five chapters: "the Holy Childhood, the Ministry, Holy Week, the Passion, and the Resurrection". He also made portraits of each of the [[four evangelists]] to honor them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/brooklynmuseum-o4548-saint-luke-saint-luc |title=James Tissot: Saint Luke (Saint Luc) (1886) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |format= |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the ''Synopsis of the Four Gospels'' by [[Kurt Aland]]&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Aland, 1982 ''Synopsis of the Four Gospels'' United Bible Societies {{ISBN|0-8267-0500-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to be seen by some as "perhaps the standard for an in-depth study of the Gospels."&lt;ref name=Cox6&gt;Steven L. Cox, Kendell H Easley, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} pages 6–8&lt;/ref&gt; A key feature of Aland's work is the incorporation of the full text of the Gospel of John.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; [[John Bernard Orchard]]'s synopsis (which has the same title)&lt;ref&gt;John Bernard Orchard, 1983 ''Synopsis of the Four Gospels'' T&amp;T Clark Publishers {{ISBN|0-567-09331-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; was of note in that it took the unusual approach of abandoning [[Markan priority]] and assuming the synopics were written in this order: Matthew, Luke, Mark.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;

==A parallel harmony presentation==
{{See also|Commons:Gospel harmony}}
The following table is an example of a parallel harmony, based on the [[list of key episodes in the Canonical Gospels]]. The order of events, especially during the ministry period, has been the subject of speculation and scholarly debate. While this harmony compares the work of several scholars, other harmonies may differ substantially on the placement of some events. The episode structure within the table is based on Edward Robinson's ''A Harmony of the Gospels in Greek''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=William Newcome |editor=Edward Robinson |title=A harmony of the Gospels in Greek, in the general order of Le Clere &amp; Newcome, with Newcome's notes: Printed from the text and with the various readings of Knapp |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_harmony_of_the_Gospels_in_Greek_in_the.html?id=04bNAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Gould and Newman |year=1834}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3052">[[File:Hagenhufendorf.jpg|right|thumb|Plan of a ''Hagenhufendorf'']]
A '''''Hagenhufendorf''''' (German: also ''Bachhufendorf'', ''Hagenhufensiedlung'' or ''Hägerhufensiedlung'') is an elongated settlement, similar to a ''[[Reihendorf]]'', laid out along a road running parallel to a stream, whereby only one side of the road has houses, whilst on the opposite side are the [[hide (unit)|hides]] (''Hufen''), the handkerchief-shaped farmer's fields of medieval origin, about 20 to 40 [[morgen]]s in area. 

== Name ==
This German term is probably derived from ''Hagenrecht'' ("hedging right"), i.e. the owner had a right to enclose the land he used. This went even further for the ''Hägerhufensiedlungen'', where there was a ''Hägerjunker'' in charge and special courts dealing with enclosure issues, the ''Hägergerichte''.

== Description ==
The ''Hagenhufensiedlung'' was a form of planned settlement typical of the [[High Middle Ages]] that consisted of individually owned strips of land that were strung together in a line. The hides were as wide as the farmstead, but could be several hundred metres long. 

The enclosed plots were used as vegetable gardens and for keeping small animals. The stream at the back of the farmhouses supplied the necessary water. From this type of settlement, long linear villages developed like [[Auhagen]], [[Wiedensahl]], [[Isernhagen]], [[Auetal|Kathrinhagen]] or [[Rodewald]] in Lower Saxony. ''Hagenhufensiedlungen'' may be found from the [[Taunus]] region as far as [[Western Pomerania]]. The ''Hägerhufensiedlung'' is restricted to a region in the area of the [[Weser Uplands]], [[Leine Uplands]] and [[Kreis Lippe|Lippe]]. 

== Origin ==
The ''Hagenhufendörfer'' arose from the planned settlement of forested areas, predominantly in the 13th century, with the aim of clearing and cultivating the land. These villages had a [[lokator]] with a double hide (''Doppelhufe'').
The ''Hägerhufensiedlungen'' go back to the 11th-century [[Eschershausen#History|Eschershausen]] Treaty. Although they had no double hide and no lokator, they did have special enclosure rights (''Hägerrecht'').

== Extent ==
''Hagenhufendörfer'' are especially common in the [[Börde]] regions, on the [[North German Plain]] immediately north of the German [[Central Uplands]]. The best-known region, with many such villages, is the area around [[Stadthagen]], which was itself founded as a planned town in the centre of the plain that was to be settled, between the [[Schaumburg Forest]] and [[Bückeberge|Bückebergen]]. The ''Hägerhufensiedlungen'' of the fertile plain can no longer be made out in the countryside.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3738">'''Illinois Public Interest Research Group''' ('''Illinois PIRG''') is a [[non-profit organization]] that is part of the state [[Public Interest Research Groups|PIRG]] organizations. It works on a variety of political activities, including [[childhood obesity]], reducing the interest on student loans, and closing tax loopholes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Illinois Public Interest Research Group|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/tag/illinois-public-interest-research-group/ |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=House Approves Lower Rate on Student Loans|url=http://www.pjstar.com/free/x1580234912/House-approves-lower-rates-on-student-loans |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Public Interest Research Groups (PIRGs) are non-profit organizations that employ [[grassroots]] organizing, direct advocacy, [[investigative journalism]], and [[Law suit|litigation]] to affect public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. PIRG: About Us |url=http://www.uspirg.org/page/usp/about-us |accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Illinois PIRG was founded in 1987, and has offices in [[Chicago]], [[Springfield, IL]], and a national lobbying office in Washington, D.C. called [[US PIRG]].&lt;ref name="Benton Foundation"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Benton Foundation]] |url=http://www.benton.org/sites/benton.org/files/bentonetal_Final.doc |title=In the Matter of Third Periodic Review of the Commission’s Rules and Policies Affecting the Conversion To Digital Television, Comments of Illinois PIRG" |accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PIRGs emerged in the early 1970s on U.S. [[college]] campuses. The PIRG model was proposed in the book ''[[Action for a Change]]'' by [[Ralph Nader]] and [[Donald K. Ross (author)|Donald Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nader|first=Ralph|title=Action for a Change: A Student's Manual for Public Interest Organizing|year=1972|publisher=Grossman Publishers|location=New York|author2=Donald Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among other early accomplishments, the PIRGs were responsible for much of the [[Container deposit legislation#United States|Container Container Deposit Legislation in the United States]], also known as "bottle bills."&lt;ref name="Boston College, The Heights, Volume LVI, Number 4, 22 September 1975"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Boston College]] |url=http://newspapers.bc.edu/cgi-bin/bostonsh?a=d&amp;d=bcheights19750922.2.30|title=PIRG Backs "Bottle Bill"|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Sun Sentinel]] |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-11-08/news/9102150529_1_bottle-bill-beverage-containers-industry-recycling-program|title=Bottle Bill Beverage Containers Recycling Program"|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[information engineering]] used to{{cn|Who says it no longer does?|date=October 2018}} refer to a [[software engineering]] methodology that is now more commonly known as 
[[information technology engineering]]{{cn|says who?|date=October 2018}} or information engineering methodology. It began to gain its current meaning early on in the [[21st century]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Elements==
===Machine learning and statistics===
{{Main article|Machine learning}}
Machine learning is the field that involves the use of [[statistical]] and [[probabilistic]] methods to let [[computers]] "learn" from data without being explicitly programmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning|last=Bishop|first=Christopher|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York Inc.|year=2007|isbn=978-0387310732|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data science involves the application of machine learning to extract knowledge from data.

Subfields of machine learning include [[deep learning]], [[supervised learning]], [[unsupervised learning]], [[reinforcement learning]], [[semi-supervised learning]], and [[active learning (machine learning)|active learning]].

[[Causal inference]] is another related component of information engineering.

===Control theory===

Control theory refers to the control of ([[continuous function|continuous]]) [[dynamical systems]], with the aim being to avoid delays, overshoots, or [[stability theory|instability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Control Systems Engineering|last=Nise|first=Norman|publisher=Wiley|year=2015|isbn=978-1118170519|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information engineers tend to focus more on control theory rather than the physical design of control systems and [[Electronic circuit|circuits]] (which tends to fall under electrical engineering).

Subfields of control theory include [[classical control theory|classical control]], [[optimal control]], and [[nonlinear control]].

===Signal processing===
{{Main article|Signal processing}}
Signal processing refers to the generation, analysis and use of [[signals]], which could take many forms such as [[image processing|image]], [[sound processing|sound]], electrical, or biological.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Digital Signal Processing|last=Lyons|first=Richard|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=978-0137027415|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9919">'''Islamic graffiti''' is a [[genre]] of [[graffiti]] created by [[Islam]]ic people or by people inspired by the Islamic religion. Containing Islamic themes, this type of [[art]] finds expression in a variety of forms. The most common languages used are English and Arabic.   Like all other forms of art, graffiti can serve as a medium for instigating political or social change, or as a form of self-expression.

==Socio-political==
===Sticker art===
[[Sticker art]] refers to the practice of posting images or phrases to convey a message.[[File:Shop bamako posters marche fadjiguila.jpg|thumb|An example of Islamic sticker art in Mali]]
A collaborative project called "INSIDE OUT: Artocracy in Tunisia" uses sticker art to promote the spirit of democracy in post-revolutionary Tunisia. Prior to the revolution, only presidential photography could be found in the public space. A group of six photographers, along with a French graffiti artist called JR, replaced these pictures with black and white photographs of anonymous Tunisian people. Their goal is to inspire the people of Tunisia to see themselves in a new light. One of the photographers states: "If people want to tear them down, or write something on them, that's part of the project, that's okay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Yasmine|title=Art challenges Tunisian revolutionaries|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/03/201132223217876176.html|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=26 March 2011|agency=Al Jazeera|language=English, Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subvertising===
[[Subvertising]] refers to the practice of making spoofs or parodies of political advertisements. 
Princess Hijab, an anonymous street artist from Paris, paints Muslim veils on advertisements in the subway. She refers to this as "hijabisation." Since the enforcement of the "burqa ban," in which women are prohibited from wearing the burqa in public places, her art has sparked feminist and fundamentalist questions. It is not known if Princess Hijab is a Muslim or even a woman.  "The real identity behind Princess Hijab is of no importance," she has been quoted. Inspired by Naomi Klein's [[No Logo]], she drew her first veil in 2006 on the French rapper [[Diam's]], who subsequently happened to convert to Islam and now wears a veil. Graffiti on the subways in Paris is considered vandalism. Consequently, Princess Hijab has become highly selective and only paints four to five advertisements a year. She chooses to combine veils with advertisements because they are both "dogmas that can be questioned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chrisafis|first=Angelique|title=Cornered – Princess Hijab, Paris's elusive graffiti artist|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/11/princess-hijab-paris-graffiti-artist|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 November 2010|agency=Guardian News and Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graffiti as a form of communication in [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] began in 1987 during the first Intifada. This was a period in which there were no Palestinian TV or Radio stations in the Gaza Strip. Murals commemorated martyrs as well as called protestors to action. Israeli military would force Palestinians to wash off graffiti from their homes. The Dome of the Rock was common among murals in Palestine. In 2006, [[Hamas]] took over the graffiti scene. Hamas would encourage people to perform the first of the day’s five prayers through street art.&lt;ref&gt;Gröndahl, Mia. ''Gaza Graffiti: Messages of Love and Politics''. Cairo: American University in Cairo, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, The [[West Bank]] wall is covered in graffiti. Numerous messages can be found including marriage proposals, notes to friends, and jokes. Also common are messages of peace. One reads: "Mirror, mirror on the wall. When will this senseless object fall?" "Trying to imagine a clear view between Palestine and Israel," is another. Messages such as these splatter across the wall, and some graffiti artists will paint your message for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Melissa|title=Palestinian graffiti spreads message of peace|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2009-04-16/world/palestinian.wall.graffiti_1_west-bank-five-palestinian-villages-barrier-cuts?_s=PM:WORLD|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=16 April 2009|agency=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Lebanon]], [[Yazan Halwani]] has developed his form of graffiti based on Arabic calligraphy, figures and culture. His style mixes portraiture and Arabic calligraphy on large walls in [[Beirut]]. Halwani thinks that graffiti in the Arab world and Beirut should not evolve into a form of vandalism and therefore he says that his murals try to adapt to their environment and not against it.&lt;ref&gt;Alabaster, Olivia.

Tanha) has been credited with starting the modern street art movement in [[Tehran]] and [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vandalog|title=A1one in Tehran IRAN|url=http://blog.vandalog.com/2011/05/from-a1one-in-tehran-iran/|accessdate=8 October 2012|newspaper=Vandalog|date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his career as an artist in the late 1990s with indoor painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title={{sic|Graffitti|hide=y}} in Tehran: Instigating Political Change |url=http://socialactive.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/graffitti-in-teheran-instigating-political-change/|work=the bohemian|publisher=Social Active|accessdate=9 June 2012|date=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Now he is an international artist, known for his innovative Arabic and Persian calligraphic street art painted in various countries.

In 2003, he moved outdoors by spraying a 30x40cm stencil on university walls to express to the "uncommon pressure" at the university which was "endured in silence." However, the motivations behind his art are not protest. He states that his art is simply personal expression: "A drawing on the street is similar to a letter: It proves that there is a writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Uleshka |title=A1one: 1st generation Graffiti in Iran |url=http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ |accessdate=9 June 2012 |newspaper=PingMag |date=19 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080712042707/http://pingmag.jp/2007/01/19/a1one-1st-generation-graffiti-in-iran/ |archivedate=12 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Arab World, three major areas of interest can be identified: Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories and the Arab states that were involved in the Arab Spring. In these areas, graffiti has been perceived, both by the public and the media, as a barometer of the society. Lebanon’s religious and ethnic diversity and its position at the crossroad of the Mediterranean basin and the Arab World have contributed to the appearance and development of an active youth culture and graffiti is part of it. Secondly, the Palestinian Territories are a space where graffiti is one of the most powerful forms of protest against what its inhabitants perceive as a contemporary form of colonization. Last but not least, the social importance of graffiti and its militant functions have recently been reflected by the international media, within the coverage of the uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Syria. The media coverage of the Arab Spring has drawn attention to a type of both artistic and political expression typical for the young people in the MENA region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicoarea|first=Georgiana|url=https://www.academia.edu/2219214/Cultural_Interactions_in_The_Graffiti_Subculture_of_The_Arab_World._Between_Globalization_and_Cosmopolitanism|title=Cultural Interactions in the Graffiti Subculture of the Arab World |publisher=Romano-Arabica Journal |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
After growing up in Paris during the late 80s and early 90s, graffiti artist eL Seed found himself inspired by hip-hop culture. With parents from Temoula, [[Tunisia]], he explored his North African origins by learning calligraphy. Before becoming an artist, he pursued degrees in marketing and business. After befriending a graffiti artist known as Hest1, he began to combine his love of graffiti and calligraphy. Today, he creates both personal exhibitions as well as murals for commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alwazir|first=Atiaf Z.|title=Garbage Collectors and the Struggle For Workers' Rights in Yemen|url=http://aslanmedia.com/arts-culture/324-from-elan/4175-el-seed-explores-identity-with-graffiti-art|accessdate=9 June 2012|newspaper=Aslan Media|date=6 June 2012|agency=Aslan Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also combining calligraphy with graffiti, Niels Meulman (also known as SHOE) coined the phrase "[[calligraffiti]]." Born in Amsterdam, SHOE has worked for ad agencies such as BBDO and the television channel [[MTV]].  The Metropolitan Museum of Art called calligraffiti "a new explosive art form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calligraffiti: An Explosive New Art Form (17 pics)|url=http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/calligraffiti-an-explosive-new|work=My Modern Met|publisher=My Modern Met|accessdate=9 June 2012|author=alice|date=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9415">[[File:VIII. Internationales Finale in Warschau 2014.JPG|thumb|VIII. International final in Warsaw, Poland 2014]]
'''Jugend debattiert international''' is a German-language [[debating]] competition for students based on the national German pupils' contest ''Jugend debattiert''. It is held in ten countries of Central and Eastern Europe: [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]] ([[Moscow]] and [[St. Petersburg]]), [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Hungary]]. The project is funded by the [[Goethe-Institut]], the [[Foundation "Remembrance, Responsibility and Future"]], the Hertie Foundation and the Central Agency for German Schools Abroad (Zentralstelle für das Auslandsschulwesen). There are local supporters in three countries: In Czech Republic the project is supported by the Czech-German Future Fund, in Lithuania by the Lithuanian Information and Technology Center for students. In Poland Jugend debattiert international is supported by the Foundation for Polish-German Cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jugend-debattiert.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Competition==
''Jugend debattiert international'' is the only international German-language debating contest for students.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} It helps young people in Central and Eastern Europe to advocate their views and opinions and represents and promotes the German language as a medium of [[debate]]. Beyond supporting language acquisition, it strengthens conversation skills and promotes a deeper understanding of [[democracy]]. Thus the project not only encourages democracy, but also works towards the formation of an international young elite. The debates revolve around topics such as school life, [[fundamental rights]], history (especially historical experiences of injustice), and [[Europe]]. ''Jugend debattiert international'' targets students from 10th grade onwards who master German at least to the level of B2 of the [[Common European Framework of Reference]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jugend-debattiert.eu/idee/wettbewerb/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015/16 more than 2300 students at 157 schools took part in the competition. The project is integrated into the curriculum. In class students are trained in the rules of debating and enter the competition on a school level. The best students compete the next stages of the competition: school district and national level. The winners (first and second) from each of the eight countries will finally compete in the international finale. Since the fourth international finale 2010 in Berlin, the winners of the German competition ''Jugend debattiert'' support them as advisors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jugend-debattiert.eu/idee/wettbewerb/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and evaluation of the debates==
The format of the [[debate]] is strictly set up: Four students, two on the ''pro'' side, two on the ''contra'' side, debate for 24 minutes in German language on socio-political issues (e.g., "Should Turkey accede to the European Union?"). The debate starts with an opening round in which every participant has two minutes to outline his or her position. In the following twelve minutes the four debaters can exchange their arguments without strict regulations. During the final round the participants have one minute each to reflect on the arguments and summarize their final position in the light of the debate.
A jury of three evaluates the debate according to the following points: expertise, eloquence, conversational competence and persuasiveness. Language skills are not included in the assessment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jugend-debattiert.eu/idee/die-debatte/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Jugend debattiert international'' was first carried out in Poland and the Czech Republic in 2005. Since 2006, schools in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine have been taking part in the project. In 2009 Moscow and Saint Petersburg joined the competition after a two-year pilot phase.
In 2007, students from all seven countries and Germany met for the first international finale in [[Prague]] under the auspices of the former president of Czech Republic, [[Václav Havel]]. Winners of the first international finale were Jakub Štefela from [[Liberec]], Czech Republic and Peer Klüßendorf from [[Rostock]], Germany. The Second international finale took place in October 2008 in ''Warsaw'' under the auspices of the [[Sejm Marshal]] of the Republic of Poland, Mr. [[Bronislaw Komorowski]]. Barbara Wasilewska from Warsaw, Poland and Wiebke Neelsen from [[Wismar]], Germany, won this competition. In February 2010 the third international finale took place in Prague. Jitka Rutrlová from Prague, Czech Republic and Maximilian Behrens from [[Münster]], Germany, were the winners of the final debate. The fourth international finale was held in [[Berlin]] in November 2010. Irina Avdeeva from Russia was awarded first place in competition 2009/2010 after the final debate. In 2011 the international final took place for the fifth time in [[Kiev]], Ukraine. Annett Lymar from Estonia won the final debate. In 2012 the sixth international final was won by the Hungarian student Gréta Szabó from [[Budapest]]. The international final was held for the seventh time in 2013 in [[Budapest]]. Dominika Perlínová from the Czech Republic was announced as the international winner. The 8th international final took place in Warsaw. Anastasija Minitš from Estonia won this year´s competition. In 2015 the international finale was held for the 9th time in Latvian capital Riga. The international winner was Anna Ryan from Hungary. From 2016 on, Slovakia and Slovenia take part in the project. In this year the international final took place in Prague and Khoi Nguyen won in his hometown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">'''Keywords''' are the words that academics use to reveal the internal structure of an author's 
reasoning.  While they are used primarily for [[rhetoric]], they are also used in a strictly 
grammatical sense for structural composition, reasoning, and comprehension.  Indeed, they are 
an essential part of any language.

There are many different types of keyword categories including: Conclusion, Continuation, Contrast,
Emphasis, Evidence, Illustration and Sequence. Each category serves its own function, as do the keywords
inside of a given category.

When someone uses a search engine, they type in one or more words describing what they are looking for:
'Norwich florist' or 'cheap holidays Greece', for example. These words or phrases are known as keywords.

==Corpus linguistic keywords==
In [[corpus linguistics]], key words are words that appear with statistically unusual frequency in a text
or a corpus of texts. They are identified by software that compares a word-list of the text with a word-list
based on a larger reference corpus. A suitable term for the phenomenon is [[keyness]]. The procedure used,
for example by [[WordSmith]], to list key words and phrases and plot where they appear in texts. These items
are very often of interest—particularly those human readers would not likely notice, such as prepositions,
time adverbs, and pronouns.

==Teaching Keywords==
One method used to teach keywords is called the "keyword method." It involves taking complex keywords that students do not know very well, and makes them into easier words. The easier words must have something to do with the complex keywords so students can correlate between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Uberti|first1=H. Z.|last2=Scruggs|first2=T.

'''Margarete Bieber''' (31 July 1879  &amp;ndash; 25 February 1978) was a Jewish&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Morgenstern]], ''"Jüdisches biographisches Lexikon. Eine Sammlung von bedeutenden Persönlichkeiten jüdischer Herkunft ab 1800"'', {{Interlanguage link multi|Lit Verlag|de}}, Wien; p. 91, 92&lt;/ref&gt; German-American [[art history|art historian]], [[classical archaeology|classical archaeologist]] and professor. She became the second woman university professor in Germany in 1919 when she took a position at the [[University of Giessen]]. She studied the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Rome]] as well as the sculpture and [[clothing in ancient Rome]] and [[Clothing in ancient Greece|Greece]].

Bieber left Germany after the Nazis seized power and she made her way to the United States where she taught at [[Barnard College]], [[Columbia University]] and [[Princeton University]]. She published hundreds of works during her career and authored definitive works in four areas of study: the Greek and Roman theater, Hellenistic sculpture, ancient dress, and Roman copies of Greek art.&lt;ref name="Medwid, M. 2000 p. 37"&gt;Medwid, M. (2000) The makers of classical archaeology, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; She emphasised that Roman reproductions of Greek originals were essentially Roman works and carried the stamp of Roman civilization.&lt;ref name="Medwid, M. 2000 p. 37"/&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Margarete Bieber was born on 31 July 1879 in [[Drzonowo, Szczecinek County|Schönau]], [[Schlochau (district)|Landkreis Schlochau]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schlochau.de/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=46&lt;/ref&gt; (present day Drzonowo, [[Poland]]) to Jewish parents {{mdash}} Valli Bukofzer, and Jacob Heinrich Bieber, a factory owner.&lt;ref name="Two Worlds"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonfante|first=Larissa|last2=Recke|first2=Matthias|title=Margarete Bieber: Two Worlds|url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/bios/Bieber_Margarete.pdf|publisher=Brown University|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended a girls' school in [[Świecie|Schwetz]] (present day Świecie) for six years before being sent to a finishing school in [[Dresden]].&lt;ref name="Two Worlds"/&gt;

In 1899 she went to Berlin where she attended Gymnasialkurse, a private school founded by [[Helene Lange]]. In 1901 she passed the ''Maturitätsprüfung'' in [[Toruń|Thorn]] and registered at the [[University of Berlin]]. As women were not allowed to enroll, she audited her classes, attending lectures by [[Hermann Alexander Diels]], [[Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz]] and [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]].&lt;ref name="Two Worlds"/&gt; She graduated in the winter semester 1901/02 in Berlin. In 1904 she moved to Bonn, studying under [[Paul Clemen]], [[Georg Loeschcke]] and [[Franz Bücheler]]. She received her PhD from the [[University of Bonn]] in 1907, her dissertation concerning representations of [[clothing in ancient Greece|ancient Greek costume]] in art.&lt;ref name="doah"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bieber, Margarete|url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/bieberm.htm|publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAW"/&gt;

=== Research and professorship ===
In the following years, Bieber did extensive research throughout the Mediterranean. She was the first woman to receive a travel grant from the [[German Archaeological Institute]] (DAI) in 1909. From then until 1914, she did research in [[Athens]] and later [[Rome]]. She became a member of the DAI in 1913. When the [[First World War]] broke out, Bieber returned to Germany and worked as a [[Red Cross]] worker. From Easter 1915, she taught seminars and ran the Archaeological Institute at the University of Berlin for her former instructor Georg Loeschcke, who was ill. After he died in November 1915, a successor was appointed and she was not allowed to continue teaching as women could not receive [[habilitation]] at the time. Bieber continued to teach private courses out of her home, counting Dora and [[Erwin Panofsky]] among her students.&lt;ref&gt;Bonfante, Larissa. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27687337 "Margarete Bieber."] ''Gnomon'' 51 (September 1979), pp. 621–624.&lt;/ref&gt;

After several unsuccessful attempts, her postdoctoral was finally approved in 1919 and she became an associate professor in classical archaeology at the [[University of Giessen]]. She was the second woman to become a University professor in Germany.&lt;ref name="doah"/&gt; Beginning in 1928, she headed the Giessen Institute of Archaeology and in 1931, she was made a full professor. Her future looking secure, she adopted a six-year-old girl named Ingeborg in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidenreich|first=Harriet Pass|title=Female, Jewish, and Educated: The Lives of Central European University Women|year=2002|publisher=Indiana Univ.

She, Ingeborg and her governess Katharina Freytag left Germany for England where Bieber became an honorary fellow at [[Somerville College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bieber, Margarete (1879–1978) - Art History|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/4549/Bieber-Margarete-1879-1978.html|publisher=JRank|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emigration to America ===
Bieber left for the United States in 1934 at the invitation of [[Barnard College]], where she was a lecturer.&lt;ref name="NAW"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Edward T. James |title=Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 5|year=2004|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard Univ. Press|location=Cambridge, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-674-01488-6|pages=56–57|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WSaMu4F06AQC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Margarete%20Bieber&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was recommended to [[Columbia University]], where she became a visiting professor in the Department of Art History and Archaeology in 1936. She applied for American citizenship in 1939.&lt;ref name="Two Worlds"/&gt;

In 1939, she published ''The History of the Greek and Roman Theater''. It became a foundational text for students of the ancient theaters of [[theatre of ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Rome]], delving into the nuances of production and the practicalities of staging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashby|first=Clifford|title=Classical Greek Theatre: New Views of an Old Subject|year=1998|publisher=University of Iowa Press|isbn=978-1-58729-463-1|pages=139–145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vm3Fb6-vWXQC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Bieber assisted German refugees. She retired from Columbia University in 1948, though she continued to lecture at the [[Columbia University School of General Studies]] and at [[Princeton University]]. The [[Bollingen Foundation]] helped to fund ''The Sculpture of the Hellenistic Age'', published in 1955. &lt;!-- needs source: She was the first female professor at Princeton University. --&gt; She continued to publish works, describing sculpture in American museums and ancient clothing.&lt;ref name="NAW"/&gt;

Bieber was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1971&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1974, the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] awarded her the [[Gold Medal of the Archaeological Institute of America|Gold Medal for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement]]. She remained active in her later years, living with her adopted daughter, Ingeborg Sachs. Her final work, ''Ancient Copies'', was published in 1977 and detailed the transformation and reflection in Roman copies of Greek art. Bieber died on 25 February 1978 in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]]. She was 98.&lt;ref name="NAW"/&gt;

'''Men who have sex with men''' ('''MSM'''), also known as '''males who have sex with males''', are [[male]] persons who engage in [[sexual activity]] with members of the same sex, regardless of how they [[Identity (social science)|identify]] themselves; many such men do not [[Sexual identity|sexually identify]] as [[gay]], [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]].&lt;ref name="UNAIDS1"&gt;{{cite web|title= UNAIDS: Men who have sex with men|publisher= [[UNAIDS]]|date=2006|accessdate=April 2, 2014|url= http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf|archivedate=June 21, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621123530/http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''MSM'' was created in the 1990s by [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] to study the spread of disease among men who have sex with men, regardless of identity.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS1" /&gt; The term ''MSM'' is often used in medical literature and [[social research]] to describe such men as a group for research studies without considering issues of self-identification. It does not describe any specific sexual activity, and which activities are covered by the term depends on context.

== As a constructed behavioral category ==
The term ''MSM'' had been in use in [[public health]] discussions, especially in the context of [[HIV/AIDS]], since 1990 or earlier, but the coining of the [[initialism]] by Glick ''et al.'' in 1994 "signaled the crystallization of a new concept."&lt;ref name="Young Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Young RM, Meyer IH |title=The trouble with "MSM" and "WSW": erasure of the sexual-minority person in public health discourse |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=95 |issue=7 |pages=1144–1149 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15961753 |pmc=1449332 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.046714 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glick M, Muzyka BC, Salkin LM, Lurie D |title=Necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis: a marker for immune deterioration and a predictor for the diagnosis of AIDS |journal=J. Periodontol. |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=393–7 |date=May 1994 |pmid=7913962 |doi= 10.1902/jop.1994.65.5.393|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavioral concept comes from two distinct academic perspectives. First, it was pursued by [[epidemiologists]] seeking behavioral categories that would offer better analytical concepts for the study of disease-risk than identity-based categories (such as "gay", "[[bisexual]]", or "straight"), because a man who self-identifies as gay or bisexual is not necessarily sexually active with men, and someone who identifies as straight might be sexually active with men. Second, its usage is tied to criticism of [[sexual identity]] terms prevalent in [[social construction]] literature which typically rejected the use of identity-based concepts across cultural and historical contexts. ''[[The Huffington Post]]''  postulates that the term ''MSM'' was created by [[Cleo Manago]], the man who is also credited for coining the term ''[[same gender loving]]'' (SGL).&lt;ref&gt;[[The Huffington Post]], "[[Cleo Manago]]: The Most Dangerous Black Gay Man?" by Irene Monroe, January 1, 2016 [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/irene-monroe/cleo-manago_b_1280272.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

MSM are not limited to small, self-identified, and visible sub-populations. ''MSM'' and ''gay'' refer to different things: behaviors and social identities. ''MSM'' refers to sexual activities between men, regardless of how they identify, whereas ''gay'' can include those activities but is more broadly seen as a cultural identity. ''Homosexuality'' refers to sexual/romantic attraction between members of the same sex and may or may not include romantic relationships. ''Gay'' is a social identity and is generally the preferred social term, whereas ''homosexual'' is used in formal contexts, though the terms are not entirely interchangeable. Men who are [[non-heterosexual]] or [[questioning (sexuality)|questioning]] may identify with all, none, a combination of these, or one of the newer terms indicating a similar sexual, romantic, and cultural identity like ''[[bi-curious]]''.

In their assessment of the knowledge about the sexual networks and behaviors of MSM in Asia, Dowsett, Grierson and McNally concluded that the category of MSM does not correspond to a single social identity in any of the countries they studied.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;A review of knowledge about the sexual networks and behaviors of men who have sex with men in Asia.

In some countries, homosexual relationships may be illegal or taboo, making MSM difficult to reach.&lt;ref name="msmafrica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidsportal.org/News_Details.aspx?id=5208&amp;nex=5 |title=MSM in Africa: highly stigmatized, vulnerable and in need of urgent HIV prevention |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713125016/http://www.aidsportal.org/News_Details.aspx?ID=5208 |archivedate=July 13, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=India&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infochangeindia.org/200801116825/Agenda/HIV/AIDS-Big-Questions/Criminalising-high-risk-groups-such-as-MSM.html|title= Criminalizing high-risk groups such as MSM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental ===
Since medical literature began to describe homosexuality, it has often been approached from a view that assumed or sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause. Much literature on mental health and homosexuals centered on examples of their depression, [[substance abuse]], and suicide. Although these issues exist among non-heterosexuals, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures were regarded as indications of the issues faced by homosexuals in Western societies in the late 20th century, which often adversely affected their mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Schlager, Neil, ed. (1998). ''Gay &amp; Lesbian Almanac''. St. James Press. {{ISBN|1-55862-358-2}}, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in a country with a tolerant climate regarding homosexuality such as Sweden, same-sex married individuals evidence a higher risk for suicide — almost three times higher,  than other married individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Björkenstam|first=Charlotte|last2=Andersson|first2=Gunnar|last3=Dalman|first3=Christina|last4=Cochran|first4=Susan|last5=Kosidou|first5=Kyriaki|date=2016-07-01|title=Suicide in married couples in Sweden: Is the risk greater in same-sex couples?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-016-0154-6|journal=European Journal of Epidemiology|language=en|volume=31|issue=7|pages=685–690|doi=10.1007/s10654-016-0154-6|issn=0393-2990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who inserts their penis into an infected partner is at risk because sexually transmitted diseases (STDS/STIs) can enter through the [[urethra]] or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis. Also, condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex. Thus, even with a condom, anal sex can be risky.&lt;ref name="CDC anal sex"&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Transmission|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)|accessdate=May 3, 2014|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/transmission.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Werner"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Werner W.

[[Genital human papillomavirus]] (HPV) is a common virus that most sexually active people in the U.S. will have at some time in their lives.&lt;ref name="CDC HPV men" /&gt; It is passed on through genital contact and is also found on areas that condoms do not cover.&lt;ref name="CDC HPV men" /&gt; Most men who get HPV of any type never develop any symptoms or health problems.&lt;ref name="CDC HPV men" /&gt; Some types of HPV can cause genital warts, penile cancer, or anal cancer.&lt;ref name="CDC HPV men" /&gt; MSM and men with compromised [[immune systems]] are more likely than other men to develop anal cancer.&lt;ref name="CDC HPV men" /&gt; The incidence of anal cancer among HIV‐positive MSM is 9 times higher than among HIV‐negative MSM, even in antiretroviral therapy.

{{Main|Men who have sex with men blood donor controversy}}
  
Many countries impose restricting on donating blood for men who have (had) sex with men, as well as their female sex partners—see the maps. Most national standards require direct questioning regarding a donor's sexual history, but the length of deferral varies.

}}The '''National Centre for Atmospheric Science''' (NCAS) is a world leader in atmospheric science. NCAS is one of the Natural Environment Research Council's (NERC) six research centres, and was formed in 2002 to provide the UK with national capability in atmospheric science research and technology. 

NCAS research programmes include:

* Climate change science (including climate modelling and predictions)
* Atmospheric composition (including air quality modelling and predictions)
* Weather (including hazardous weather)
* Technologies for observing and modelling the atmosphere 

NCAS provides UK researchers with scientific facilities and services that enable excellent atmospheric science at a national scale. These include a world-leading aircraft, ground-based instrumentation, and access to computer models and facilities for storing and accessing scientific data. NCAS is not based in one location, its staff, facilities and services are distributed across many UK universities and related institutions. 

The head office is based in Leeds: National Centre For Atmospheric Science Fairbairn House 71-75 Clarendon Road Leeds LS2 9PH Tel: +44 (0) 113 34 36408

'''Philip Gossett''' (September 27, 1941 – June 12, 2017)&lt;ref name="chicagotribune"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/vonrhein/ct-ent-0614-gossett-obit-20170613-column.html |title=Philip Gossett, scholar of 19th-century Italian opera, is dead at 75 |first=John |last=von Rhein |date=June 13, 2017 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=June 15, 2017|archive-url=https://archive.is/20170615151852/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/vonrhein/ct-ent-0614-gossett-obit-20170613-column.html |archive-date=2017-06-15|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[musicologist]] and historian, and Robert W. Reneker Distinguished Service Professor of Music at the [[University of Chicago]]. His lifelong interest in 19th-century Italian opera began with listening to [[Metropolitan Opera]] broadcasts in his youth. ''Divas and Scholars: Performing Italian Opera'', a major work on the subject, won the Otto Kinkeldey Award of the [[American Musicological Society]] as best book on music of 2006.

Philip Gossett's contributions to opera scholarship and how they can influence operatic performance may best be summed up by ''[[Newsday]]'''s comment that "some encomiasts claim that soprano [[Maria Callas]] did as much for Italian opera as [[Arturo Toscanini]] or Verdi. Musicologist Philip Gossett arguably has done as much for Italian opera as any of those geniuses."&lt;ref&gt;Marion Lignara Rosenberg, [http://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/retirement/opera-review-1.650130 "Restoring the erotic to a Verdi classic"], , ''[[Newsday]]'',  2 April 2004 online at newsday.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gossett earned degrees from the [[Juilliard School]], [[Amherst College]], and [[Princeton University]]. He studied in Paris on a [[Fulbright Scholarship]].&lt;ref name="ON"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2017/9/Departments/Obituaries.html|title=Obituaries: Philip Gossett|work=[[Opera News]]|date=September 2017|volume=82|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time he began graduate musical studies in the mid-1960s, the Italian composers such as [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Giuseppe Verdi]] had been given little serious academic study.  As he noted: "If you were going to be a serious musicologist, you had to study Beethoven or Bach or Gregorian chants, but Rossini -- that was a pretty funny idea" &lt;ref name="Gossett"&gt;[http://www-news.uchicago.edu/citations/04/041219.gossett-st.html Art Golab, "U. of C. musicologist gets 'surprise' $1.5 mil. award", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', December 19, 2004, on news.uchicago.edu/citations]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he persisted and notes that "I went to [[Princeton University]] for graduate work in musicology (and) I fell more in love with the music and wrote my doctoral dissertation on the music of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi. Then I went to Paris on a [[Fulbright]] and studied Rossini's operas."&lt;ref name="Clurman"&gt;Judith Clurman, [http://www.juilliard.edu/update/journal/j_articles204.html "Meet Philip Gossett"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040503153607/http://www.juilliard.edu/update/journal/j_articles204.html |date=2004-05-03 }}, ''The Juilliard Journal Online'' on juilliard.edu, March 2004. Interview with Philip Gossett&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career, Gossett's work has frequently taken him to Italy, where he has advised on the presentations of productions at the [[Rossini Opera Festival]] in Rossini's hometown of [[Pesaro]], and he has worked directly with the Istituto Nazionale di Studi Verdiani (Institute of Verdi Studies) in [[Parma]] which was founded in 1960. Also, for the 2001 centenary of Verdi's death, he worked with the [[Teatro Regio di Parma]] on their programming. In 1968 he joined the faculty of the [[University of Chicago]] where he remained for the rest of his career.

Given that Gossett's musical interests focus on 19th-century Italian opera (especially the works of Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi),  most of his career was devoted to being General Editor of two important  projects while at the University of Chicago: the research for the preparation of [[Critical edition (opera)|critical editions]] of all the operas of both Rossini (some 70) and Verdi (some 33, in their various forms).  These are being prepared and gradually published as ''The Works of Giuseppe Verdi'' (by the University of Chicago Press in collaboration with the Italian publishing house [[Casa Ricordi]] of [[Milan]]) and of ''The Works of Gioachino Rossini'' (by [[Bärenreiter|Bärenreiter Verlag]], [[Kassel]]).

In an interview, Gossett explained what he means by the term "critical edition":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By critical edition of an opera I have always meant an edition that bases itself wherever possible on the very finest and most accurate sources for an opera. That means that it must study the entire performance history of a work. In some cases of course we have an autograph manuscript, and that helps us, but it is also where many of the problems start, because composers are known to have made mistakes in their autograph manuscripts. And therefore we are required – we feel it is necessary – to intervene and to correct errors that sometimes have been perpetrated on these works by printed editions from the beginning, so they are just mistakes in the old editions, simple mistakes.&lt;ref name="GAZZ"&gt;Gazzola, Interview with Philip Gossett on operalively.org. 17 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere, he explained the overall aim of the production of critical editions of the operas by using the example of Rossini's ''[[Il viaggio a Reims]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We used sources in Rome, Paris, Vienna, and New York. The scores reprinted cheaply today simply reproduce all the errors, all the faults of these 19th-century scores—most of which were produced very quickly and, in Verdi's own words, "are filled with errors." ... The new critical editions have tried, for the first time, to return to authentic sources and they allow performers to have access to the various versions sanctioned by the composers.&lt;ref name="Clurman"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As he has explained, Gossett does not believe that singers need to base their interpretations entirely on everything contained in a critical edition. His aim is "that performers should base their work on the finest editions possible, and that’s what we try to produce".&lt;ref name="GAZZ"/&gt;

As of 2004, it was noted that "Gossett's team (had) completed 12 of 33 projected volumes of Verdi's work and more than 30 volumes of an expected 70 for Rossini. 'I'll never get through the Rossini,' Gossett said. 'But the Verdi – I'm hoping.'"&lt;ref name="Gossett"/&gt;  However, in July 2013, the University of Chicago's "Verdi Critical Edition - Available Titles" page shows 17 opera titles by Verdi
&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Vavail.html  List of Verdi operas in critical editions]&lt;/ref&gt; and 9 Rossini opera titles currently available or planned for publication by Bärenreiter Verlag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Barenreiter%20plan.htm  Rossini operas prepared by Bärenreiter Verlag]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is in addition to the 26 Rossini operas for which critical editions have been prepared by the Rossini Foundation under Gossett's general direction.

However, he is on record as denying that the [[Claudio Scimone]] edition of ''[[Maometto II]]'' is a critical edition in the true sense of the word, but is more a performing edition by Scimone as conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Gazzola, Interview with Philip Gossett on operalively.com&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Rossini's ''[[Tancredi]]'', ''[[Ermione]]'' and ''[[Semiramide]]'' are three of critical editions which he has personally edited, while his most recent work is Verdi's ''[[La forza del destino]]'' which, while yet to be formally published, was performed at the [[San Francisco Opera]] in November 2005 in its 1869 version. The 1862 version was presented in the Stadttheater, Bern in April 2006.

===Work with US opera companies===
In the US, he has consulted with the [[Houston Grand Opera]] (in 1979 for the first production of the critical edition of ''Tancredi'', with its then newly discovered tragic ending, starring [[Marilyn Horne]])&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, ''Divas and Scholars'' pp 148-152&lt;/ref&gt;. He has worked three times with the [[Metropolitan Opera]]: for its November 1990 production of ''[[Semiramide]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Gossett, ''Divas and Scholars'', pp 175-199&lt;/ref&gt;; for its 1993 production of ''[[Stiffelio]]''; and for its 1997 production of ''[[La cenerentola]]''. He has also worked with [[Santa Fe Opera|The Santa Fe Opera]] in 2000 for Rossini's ''[[Ermione]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, ''Divas and Scholars'', pp 8-11&lt;/ref&gt; and with the [[Chicago Lyric Opera]] for the first presentations of Rossini's long-lost ''Il viaggio a Reims'' in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Gossett, ''Divas and Scholars'', pp. 152-158&lt;/ref&gt; Gossett again acted as consultant to The Santa Fe Opera during rehearsals for its 2012 season production of the new critical edition of Rossini's original ''Maometto II'' of 1820 and he returned in the same capacity during rehearsals of the company's new production of Rossini's ''[[La donna del lago]]'' during the 2013 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santafeopera.org/tickets/production.aspx?performanceNumber=5708  Performance details at The Santa Fe Opera]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2010 presentations of Verdi's ''[[Attila (opera)|Attila]]'' for the Met, Gossett also worked with conductor [[Riccardo Muti]] on revisions to the score based on new research. This has become a new critical edition of the opera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Vavail.html  The ''Atilla'' critical edition], edited by Helen Greenwald, is currently available as a rental in ''The Works of Giuseppe Verdi'' series.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muti has acknowledged Gossett's role in clarifying ambiguities (in this case in ''Rigoletto'') which had crept into many texts.&lt;ref&gt;F. Paul Driscoll, "Grandissimo Maestro", ''Opera News'', February 2010, p.20. Interview with Riccardo Muti: "Even the critics did not realize that some words they were used to hearing didn't make any sense. For example, the critical edition with Gossett revealed many important things, such as when the Duke goes in the ''taverna''...and asks for "Una stanza e del vino" ("a room and some wine") [....] but nobody realized that these are not the words that Verdi wrote.  Verdi wrote, "Tua sorella e del vino" - "I want your ''sister'' and some wine". Muti continues to explain that Rigoletto's comment to Gilda (in which he says "that's just like him", meaning that the request is typical of his behaviour)   which follows the Duke's remark, makes no sense without the word "sister" being included."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Gossett was awarded the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]]'s "Distinguished Achievement Award" in 2004, which gained him a prize of $1.5 million to facilitate his research. Also, in 1998, the Italian government gave  him the  "Cavaliere di Gran Croce", the highest honor that can be awarded to a civilian. Academically, he has been President of the American Musicological Society and of the Society for Textual Scholarship, as well as Dean of the Division of the Humanities at the University of Chicago. In 2008 Gossett was appointed foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]].

'''Planetary engineering''' is the application of [[technology]] for the purpose of influencing the global environments of a [[planet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink=Martyn J. Fogg| last=Fogg| first=Martyn J.| year=1995| title=Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments| publisher=SAE International| location=Warrendale, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its objectives usually involve increasing the [[Planetary habitability|habitability of other worlds]] or mitigating [[Holocene extinction|decreases in habitability]] to [[Earth]].

Perhaps the best-known type of planetary [[engineering]] is [[terraforming]], by which a planet's surface conditions are altered to be more like those of Earth. Planetary engineering is largely the realm of [[science fiction]] at present, although recent [[climate change]] on Earth shows that [[human]] technology can cause change on a global scale.

==Terraforming==
{{Main|Terraforming}}
Terraforming is the hypothetical process of deliberately modifying the atmosphere, [[temperature]], or environment of a planet, [[moon]], or other body to be similar to those of Earth in order to make it habitable by humans.

==Seeding==
Seeding is a term used for the process of introducing microbial or algae species on a planet or moon already offering habitable regions. Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] is a good example as it has a well protected ocean under a thick ice crust. Living on the surface of the ice crust is not possible, but some microorganisms from Earth could possibly survive in the oxygen rich environment of Europa's subsurface ocean. In the case of Europa it might be possible to incrementally seed with the species in their trophic (see foodchain) context and to build up an aquatic [[ecosystem]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Geoengineering==
{{Main|Climate engineering}}
Geoengineering is the application of planetary engineering techniques to Earth. Recent geoengineering proposals have principally been methods to tackle human-induced [[climate change]] by either removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (e.g. using [[ocean iron fertilization]]) or by managing solar radiation (e.g. by using mirrors in space) in order to negate the net warming effect of climate change.&lt;ref name = royal_society&gt;{{cite book

==Habitability maintenance==

Planetary engineering can also be applied to keep habitability of Earth in the far future. The rate of weathering of silicate minerals will increase as rising temperatures speed up chemical processes. This in turn will decrease the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as these weathering processes convert carbon dioxide gas into solid carbonates. Within the next 600 million years from the present, the concentration of CO2 will fall below the critical threshold needed to sustain C3 photosynthesis: about 50 parts per million. At this point, trees and forests in their current forms will no longer be able to survive. Unlike other animal species, humankind has the potential ability to prolong the habitability of the planet Earth by extracting and re-injecting inert carbon trapped underground back into the biosphere.

{{literature}}
A '''play''' is a form of [[literature]] written by a [[playwright]], usually consisting of [[dialogue]] and singing between [[Character (arts)|characters]], intended for [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]] rather than just [[Reading (process)|reading]]. Plays are performed at a variety of levels, from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[Off-Broadway]], [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theater]], to [[Community theatre]], as well as university or school productions. There are rare dramatists, notably [[George Bernard Shaw]], who have had little preference as to whether their plays were performed or read. The term "play" can refer to both the written texts of playwrights and to their complete theatrical performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/play "Play"]: [[Dictionary.com]] website. Retrieved on January 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genres==
[[File:P culture.svg|thumb|right|upright|Symbol of theatre]]

===Comedy===
{{Main article|Comedy}}
Comedies are plays which are designed to be humorous. Comedies are often filled with witty remarks, unusual characters, and strange circumstances. Certain comedies are geared toward different age groups. [[Comedy|Comedies]] were one of the two original play types of [[Ancient Greece]], along with tragedies. An example of a comedy would be [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', or for a more modern example the skits from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref name="anarchon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchon.tripod.com/indexGREEKTH.html|title=THE ANCIENT GREEK DRAMA &amp; THEATRE HISTORY PAGE|publisher=anarchon.tripod.com|accessdate=2008-06-16|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theatrehist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/ancient/bates001.html|title=Origin of Comedy|publisher=www.theatrehistory.com|accessdate=2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Farce====
{{Main article|Farce}}
A generally nonsensical genre of play, [[farce]]s are often acted and often involve  humor. An example of a farce includes [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'', or [[Mark Twain]]'s play ''[[Is He Dead?]]''.

====Satirical====
{{Main article|Satire}}
A [[satirical|satire]] play takes a comic look at current events  people while at the same time attempting to make a political or social statement, for example pointing out [[corruption]]. An example of a satire would be [[Nikolai Gogol]]'s ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' and [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Lysistrata]]''. Satire plays are generally one of the most popular forms of comedy, and often considered to be their own genre entirely.

====Restoration comedy====
{{Main article|Restoration comedy}}
Restoration comedy is a genre that explored relationships between men and women, and was considered risqué in its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernon|first1=P.F.|title=Marriage of Convenience and the Moral Code of Restoration Comedy|journal=Essays of Criticism|date=1962|pages=370–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters featured in restoration comedy included stereotypes of all kinds, and these same stereotypes were found in most plays of this genre, so much so that most plays were very similar in message and content.  However, since restoration comedy dealt with unspoken aspects of relationships, it created a type of connection between audience and performance that was more informal and private.

It is commonly agreed that restoration comedy has origins in [[Molière]]’s theories of comedy, but differs in intention and tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ornament of Action|date=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The inconsistency between restoration comedy’s morals and the morals of the era is something that often arises during the study of this genre.  This may give clues as to why, despite its original success, restoration comedy did not last long in the seventeenth century.  However, in recent years, it has become a topic of interest for theatre theorists, who have been looking into theatre styles that have their own conventions of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Styan|first1=J.L.|title=Restoration Comedy in Performance|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tragedy===
{{Main article|Tragedy}}
These plays contain darker themes such as death and disaster. Often the [[protagonist]] of the play has a [[tragic flaw]], a trait which leads to their downfall. Tragic plays convey all emotions and have very dramatic conflicts. [[Tragedy]] was one of the two original play types of Ancient Greece. Some examples of tragedies include William Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]'', and also [[John Webster]]'s play ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]''.&lt;ref name="anarchon" /&gt;

===Historical===
{{Main article|History (theatrical genre)}}
[[File:An actress performs a play in front of 2 statues from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Room 21, the British Museum, London.jpg|thumb|An actress performs a play in front of 2 statues from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Room 21, the British Museum, London]]
[[File:NMT Automatic performing a play in front of the Nereid Monument.jpg|thumb|An actor and actress performing a play in front of the Nereid Monument, Room 17, the British Museum, London]]
These plays focus on actual historical events. They can be tragedies or comedies, but are often neither of these. [[History]] as a separate genre was popularized by [[William Shakespeare]]. Examples of historical plays include [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[Demetrius (play)|Demetrius]]'' and William Shakespeare's ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=V3b2tlWBBUsC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22Shakespeare+popularised%22+historical+play | title=The Three Richards: Richard I ... - Google Book Search|publisher=books.google.co.uk|accessdate=2008-06-17|last=|first=| isbn=978-1-85285-521-5| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical theatre===
{{Main article|Musical theatre}}
Ballad opera, a popular theatre style at the time, was the first style of musical to be performed in the American colonies.  The first musical of American origin was premiered in Philadelphia in 1767, and was called “The Disappointment”, however, this play never made it to production.  Around the 1920s, theatre styles were beginning to be defined more clearly.  For musical theatre, this meant that composers gained the right to create every song in the play, and these new plays were held to more specific conventions, such as thirty-two-bar songs.  When the Great Depression came, many people left Broadway for Hollywood, and the atmosphere of Broadway musicals changed significantly. A similar situation occurred during the 1960s, when composers were scarce and musicals lacked vibrancy and entertainment value.

By the 1990s, there were very few original Broadway musicals, as many were recreations of movies or novels.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bordman|first1=Gerald|title=American Musical Theatre|date=1978|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical productions have songs to help explain the story and move the ideas of the play along. They are usually accompanied by dancing. Musicals can be very elaborate in settings and actor performances. Examples of musical productions include ''Wicked'' and ''Fiddler on the Roof''.

===Theatre of Cruelty===
This theatre style originated in the 1940s when Antonin Artaud hypothesized about the effects of expressing through the body as opposed to “by socially conditioned thought.”  In 1946, he wrote a preface to his works in which he explained how he came to write what and the way he did.

Above all, Artaud did not trust language as a means of communication.  Plays within the genre of theatre of cruelty are abstract in convention and content.  Artaud wanted his plays to have an effect and accomplish something.  His intention was to symbolise the subconscious through bodily performances, as he did not believe language could be effective.  Artaud considered his plays to be an enactment rather than a re-enactment, which meant he believed his actors were in reality, rather than re-enacting reality.

His plays dealt with heavy issues such as patients in psych wards, and Nazi Germany.  Through these performances, he wanted to “make the causes of suffering audible”, however, audiences originally reacted poorly, as they were so taken aback by what they saw.  Much of his work was banned in France at the time.

Artaud did not believe that conventional theatre of the time would allow the audience to have a cathartic experience and help heal the wounds of World War II.  For this reason, he moved towards radio-based theatre, in which the audience could use their imagination to connect the words they were hearing to their body.  This made his work much more personal and individualized, which he believed would increase the effectiveness of portraying suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finter|first1=Helga|last2=Griffin|first2=Matthew|title=Antonin Artaud and the Impossible Theatre: The Legacy of the Theatre of Cruelty|date=1997|publisher=MIT Press|pages=15–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre of the Absurd===
Theatre of the Absurd: This genre generally includes metaphysical representations of existential qualms and questions.  Theatre of the absurd denies rationality, and embraces the inevitability of falling into the abyss of the human condition.  Instead of discussing these issues, however, theatre of the absurd is a demonstration of them.  This leaves the audience to discuss and question the content of the play for themselves.

One of the main aspects of theatre of the absurd is the physical contradiction to language.  Oftentimes, the dialogue between characters will directly oppose their actions.

Famous playwrights within this genre include Beckett, Sartre, Ionesco, Adamov, and Genet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Esslin|first1=Martin|title=Theatre of the Absurd|date=2001|isbn=1-4000-7523-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The term "play" can be either a general term, or more specifically refer to a non-musical play. Sometimes the term "straight play" is used in contrast to "[[musical theatre|musical]]", which refers to a play based on [[music]], [[dance]], and [[song]]s sung by the play's characters. For a short play, the term "playlet" is sometimes used.

The '''Science and Technology Options Assessment (STOA)''' panel is a committee of members of the [[European Parliament]] devoted to all issues related to science and [[technology assessment]].

==Role==

STOA is an official organ of the [[European Parliament]], responsible for [[technology assessment]] and is active since 1987. Its task is to carry out expert, independent assessments of the impact of new technologies and identify long-term, strategic policy options useful to the Parliament's committees in their policy-making role.
STOA's work is carried out in partnership with external experts. These can be research institutes, universities, laboratories, consultancies or individual researchers contracted to help prepare specific projects. STOA increasingly focuses upon round-table expert discussions, conferences and workshops with associated or consequent studies. Members of Parliament (MEPs) and invited experts from EU institutions, international institutions, universities, specialist institutes, academies and other sources of expertise worldwide can jointly participate in the analysis of current issues at these events. 

The [[European Parliament]] defines its position on these issues through reports prepared by its Committees. If Committees decide that it would be helpful to their policy making role to seek out expert, independent assessments of the various scientific or technological options in the policy sectors concerned, they have STOA at their disposal: the Parliament's own Scientific and Technological Options Assessment unit.

==Organisation==
The STOA Panel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/cms/home/about/panel |title=STOA Panel |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is politically responsible for STOA's work. The STOA Panel consists of 15 Members of the European Parliament, namely the Vice-President of the Parliament responsible for STOA, four members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and two members from each of the Committees on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety; Internal Market and Consumer Protection, Employment and Social Affairs; Transport and Tourism; and Agriculture and Rural Development.
The STOA Bureau runs the activities of STOA and prepares the Panel meetings. The STOA Bureau is elected by the STOA Panel. 
Currently, the chairman is [[António Correia de Campos]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/96975/António%20Fernando_CORREIA%20DE%20CAMPOS.html António Correia de Campos, MEP and STOA Chair]&lt;/ref&gt; of Portugal.
The two Vice-Chairmen are [[Paul Rübig]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulruebig.eu/ |title=Paul Rübig, MEP and STOA Vice-Chair |publisher=Paulruebig.eu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Austria and [[Malcolm Harbour]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/4538/Malcolm_HARBOUR.html |title=Malcolm Harbour, MEP and STOA Vice-Chair |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the United Kingdom. The fourth member of the STOA Bureau is the Vice-President of the European Parliament responsible for STOA, Oldřich Vlasák.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/28323/Oldřich_VLASÁK.html Oldřich Vlasák, MEP, Vice-President of the European Parliament responsible for STOA]&lt;/ref&gt;
Former STOA Chairmen were [[Paul Rübig]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulruebig.eu/ |title=Paul Rübig, MEP, STOA Vice-Chair, former STOA Chair |publisher=Paulruebig.eu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philippe Busquin]], [[Rolf Linkohr]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/1258/ROLF_LINKOHR.html |title=Rolf Linkohr, former STOA Chair |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain Pompidou]] and [[Antonios Trakatellis]].

Based upon the needs expressed by the different parliamentary committees, STOA provides the parliamentary bodies with independent, high-quality and impartial scientific information and studies. This helps them to assess the impact of the introduction or promotion of new technologies, and identify from a technological point of view, the best possible options for action. Plenty of studies are available so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/cms/home/publications/studies |title=STOA Studies, Final reports |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STOA is member of the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network.

== Annual STOA Lecture ==
To raise public awareness of and interest in science and technology issues, STOA hosts an Annual Lecture. The event features eminent scientists - often Nobel Prize laureates - speaking about subjects placed high on the political agenda, such as the information society, oil-free future, sustainability, advances in medical research, as well as major discoveries in fundamental science. The event is open to the public. [http://www.europarl.europa.eu/stoa/cms/home/workshops/annual_lectures]

'''Sports science''' (also '''sports and exercise science''', '''sports medicine''') is a discipline that studies how the healthy human body works during exercise, and how sport and physical activity promote health and performance from cellular to whole body perspectives. The study of sports science traditionally incorporates areas of [[physiology]] ([[exercise physiology]]), [[psychology]] ([[sport psychology]]), [[anatomy]], [[biomechanics]], [[biochemistry]] and [[kinesiology|biokinetics]]. Sports scientists and performance consultants are growing in demand and employment numbers, with the ever-increasing focus within the sporting world on achieving the best results possible. Through the study of science and sport, researchers have developed a greater understanding on how the human body reacts to exercise, training, different environments and many other stimuli.

== Origins of exercise physiology ==
{{main article|Exercise physiology}}
{{references|section|date=July 2018}}

Sports science can trace its origins to ancient Greece. The noted ancient Greek physician [[Galen]] (131–201) wrote 87 detailed essays about improving health (proper nutrition), aerobic fitness, and strengthening muscles.

New ideas upon the working and functioning of the human body emerged during the renaissance as anatomists and physicians challenged the previously known theories. These spread with the implementation of the printed word, the result of [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s printing press in the 15th century. Allied with this was a large increase in academia in general, universities were forming all around the world. Importantly these new scholars went beyond the simplistic notions of the early Greek physicians, and shed light upon the complexities of the circulatory, and digestive systems. Furthermore, by the middle of the 19th century early medical schools (such as the [[Harvard Medical School]], formed 1782) began appearing in the United States, whose graduates went on to assume positions of importance in academia and allied medical research.

Medical journal publications increased significantly in number during this period. In 1898, three articles on physical activity appeared in the first volume of the '' American Journal of Physiology''. Other articles and reviews subsequently appeared in prestigious journals. The German applied physiology publication, '' Internationale Zeitschrift fur Physiologie einschliesslich Arbeitphysiologie '' (1929–1940; now known as the European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology), became a significant journal in the field of research.

A number of key figures have made significant contributions to the di
* [[Austin Flint, 2nd|Austin Flint, Jr]]., (1836–1915) One of the first American pioneer physicians, studied physiological responses to exercise in his influential medical textbooks.
* [[Edward Hitchcock, Jr.]], (1828–1911) Amherst College Professor of Hygiene and Physical Education, devoted his academic career to the scientific study of physical exercise, training and the body. Coauthored 1860 text on exercise physiology.
* George Wells Fitz, M.D. (1860–1934) Created the first departmental major in Anatomy, Physiology, and Physical Training at Harvard University in 1891.
* [[August Krogh]] (1874–1949) Won the 1920 Nobel prize in physiology for discovering the mechanism that controlled capillary blood flow in resting or active muscle.
* [[Per-Olof Åstrand]] (1922–2015) Professor at the Department of Physiology, [[Karolinska Institute]], Stockholm. Wrote a seminal paper which evaluated the physical working capacity of men and women aged 4–33 years.

== Study of sports science ==
Higher-education degrees in Sports Science or Human Physiology are also becoming increasingly popular with many universities now offering both undergraduate, postgraduate and distance learning degrees in the discipline. Opportunities for graduates in these fields employment as a [[Physical Education|Physical Education teacher]], [[Dietician]] or [[Nutritionist]], Performance Analyst, Sports coach, Sports therapist, Fitness centre manager, Sports administrator, Strength and Conditioning specialist or retail manager of a Sports store. Graduates may also be well positioned to undertake further training to become an accredited Physiotherapist, Exercise Physiologist, Research Scientist and Sports Medical Doctor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19448">[[Image:Gramsci.png|thumb|The subaltern identity is conceptually derived from the cultural-hegemony work of the Italian Marxist intellectual Antonio Gramsci.]]

In [[critical theory]] and [[postcolonialism]], the term '''subaltern''' designates the populations which are socially, politically, and geographically outside of the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[Hierarchy|power structure]] of the [[colony]] and of the colonial [[homeland]]. In describing "history told from below", ''subaltern'' was coined by [[Antonio Gramsci]], notably through his work on [[cultural hegemony]], which identified the groups that are excluded from a society's established institutions and thus denied the means by which people have a voice in their society.

The terms ''subaltern'' and ''[[Subaltern Studies]]'' entered postcolonial studies through the works of the [[Subaltern Studies|Subaltern Studies Group]], a collection of historians of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] who explored the political-actor role of the men and women who constitute the mass population, rather than the political roles of the social and economic elites, in the history of the Indian Subcontinent. &lt;ref&gt;David Ludden (ed) ''Reading Subaltern Studies: Critical History, Contested Meaning and the Globalisation of South Asia''. Delhi: Permanent Black, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marx's theory of history|Marxist historians]] had already been investigating colonial history as told from the perspective of the [[proletariat]], using the concept of social classes as being determined by economic relations. In the 1970s, ''subaltern'' began to denote the [[Colonization|colonized]] peoples of the Indian subcontinent and described a new perspective of the history of an [[Imperialism|imperial]] colony as told from the point of view of the colonized rather than that of the colonizers. In the 1980s, the scope of enquiry of Subaltern Studies was applied as an "intervention in South Asian [[historiography]]".

As a method of intellectual discourse, the concept of the ''subaltern'' is contentious because it originated as a [[Eurocentric]] method of historical enquiry for studying the non-Western people of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. From its inception as an historical-research model for studying the colonial experience of the  peoples  of the Indian Subcontinent, subaltern studies transformed from a model of intellectual discourse into a method of "vigorous post-colonial critique". The term "subaltern" is used in the fields of [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[human geography]], [[literary criticism]],&lt;ref&gt;Prakash, Gyan. "Subaltern Studies as Postcolonial Criticism", ''The American Historical Review'', December, 1994,  Vol. 99, No. 5, 1475–1490, 1476.&lt;/ref&gt; [[musicology]], and art history.

== Denotations ==
In postcolonial theory, the term ''subaltern'' describes the lower classes and the social groups who are at the margins of a society: a subaltern is a person rendered without [[human agency|agency]] by [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;Young, Robert J. C. ''Postcolonialism: A Very Short Introduction''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the literary critic [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak|Gayatri Spivak]] spoke against an overly broad application of the term in 1992:

{{Quotation|...''subaltern'' is not just a classy word for "oppressed", for [the] [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], for somebody who's not getting a piece of the pie.... In post-colonial terms, everything that has limited or no access to the cultural imperialism is subaltern—a space of difference. Now, who would say that's just the oppressed? The [[working class]] is oppressed. It's not subaltern.... Many people want to claim subalternity. They are the least interesting and the most dangerous. I mean, just by being a discriminated-against minority on the university campus; they don't need the word 'subaltern'.... They should see what the mechanics of the discrimination are. They're within the hegemonic discourse, wanting a piece of the pie, and not being allowed, so let them speak, use the hegemonic discourse. They should not call themselves subaltern.&lt;ref&gt;de Kock, Leon. "Interview With Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak: New Nation Writers Conference in South Africa." ''[http://ariel.synergiesprairies.ca/ariel/index.php/ariel/article/viewFile/2505/2458 ARIEL: A Review of International English Literature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706205400/http://ariel.synergiesprairies.ca/ariel/index.php/ariel/article/viewFile/2505/2458 |date=2011-07-06 }}''. 23(3) 1992: 29-47. ARIEL&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Marxist theory]], the civil sense of the term ''subaltern'' was first used by the Italian communist intellectual [[Antonio Gramsci]] (1891–1937). In discussions of the meaning of the "subaltern" in Gramsci's writings, Spivak and others have argued that he used the word as a synonym for the proletariat (a [[code word]] to deceive the prison censor to allow his manuscripts out the prison),&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Stephen. "The Subaltern: Genealogy of a Concept", in ''Gayatri Spivak: Ethics, Subalternity and the Critique of Postcolonial Reason''. Malden, MA: Polity, 2007: pp. 96-97; and Hoare, Quintin, and Geoffrey Nowell-Smith. "Terminology", in ''Selections from the Prison Notebooks''. New York: International Publishers, pp. xiii-xiv&lt;/ref&gt; but that interpretation has been contested, with evidence indicating that it was a novel concept in Gramsci's political theory.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Marcus E. "[https://www.academia.edu/1548708/Rethinking_the_subaltern_and_the_question_of_censorship_in_Gramscis_Prison_Notebooks Rethinking the Subaltern and the Question of Censorship in Gramsci's Prison Notebooks]," Postcolonial Studies, Volume 14, Number 4 (2011): 385-402.&lt;/ref&gt; In several essays, the postcolonial critic [[Homi K. Bhabha]] emphasized the importance of [[social power]] relations in defining subaltern social groups as oppressed, racial minorities whose social presence was crucial to the self-definition of the majority group; as such, subaltern social groups, nonetheless, also are in a position to subvert the [[authority]] of the social groups who hold hegemonic power.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Morena, Laura and Pfeiffer, Peter C. Eds. "Unsatisfied: Notes on Vernacular Cosmopolitanism", ''Text and Nation: Cross-Disciplinary Essays on Cultural and National Identities''. Columbia, SC: Camden House, 1996: pp. 191–207 and "Unpacking my library... again", ''The Post-colonial Question: Common Skies, Divided Horizons''. Iain Chambers, Lidia Curti, eds. New York: Routledge, 1996: 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Toward a New Legal Common Sense'' (2002), the sociologist [[Boaventura de Sousa Santos]] applies the term ''subaltern cosmopolitanism'' to describe the counter-hegemonic practice, social movement, resistance, and struggle against [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[globalization]], especially the struggle against [[social exclusion]]. Moreover, de Sousa Santos applies ''subaltern cosmopolitanism'' as interchangeable with the term ''cosmopolitan legality'' to describe the diverse [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] framework for an ''equality of differences'' in which the term ''subaltern'' specifically denotes the oppressed peoples at the margins of a society who are struggling against hegemonic globalization. However, context, time, and place (but perhaps not the Marxist emphasis on the economic relations) determine who, among the peoples at the margins of a society, is a Subaltern; in India women, [[dalit]]s, rural, tribal, immigrant laborers are part of subaltern.

== Theory ==
Postcolonial theory studies the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] and the continued dominance of Western ways of knowing, of intellectual enquiry. The work of [[Edward Said]] in the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' conceptually addresses oppressed subaltern peoples, to explain how the Eurocentric perspective of Orientalism produced the foundations and the justifications for the [[dominance hierarchy|domination]] of [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]], by means of colonialism. Before their explorations of ''The Orient'', the Europeans had created an imagined geography of the Orient, predefined images of savage and monstrous places that lay beyond the horizon of the known world. During their initial Oriental explorations, the Europeans' mythologies were reinforced, when the travellers returned to Europe with reports of monsters and savage lands. The concepts of the "difference" and the "strangeness" of the Orient were perpetuated through the mass communications media of the time and through discourse that created an "Us" and "Them" binary social relation with which the Europeans defined themselves by defining the differences of the Orient from the Occident, the European West. The Us-and-Them binary social relation was a foundation of colonialism, because it represented the Orient as backward and irrational lands, and, therefore, in need of European help to become modern, in the Western sense. Hence, the [[discourse]] of Orientalism is Eurocentric, and does not seek to include the voices of the Oriental peoples, the subalterns, themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''Race and Racialization: Essential Readings'' by T. Das Gupta, ''et al.'' (eds). Toronto: Canadian Scholars Press. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Joanne. ''Geographies of Postcolonialism'', chapter 1, On Orientalism. SAGE Publications. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural theorist [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] argued that the power of discourse created and reinforced Western dominance. The discourses on how Europe described differences between itself (The West) and others, used European cultural categories, languages, and ideas to represent "The Other." The knowledge produced by such a discourse becomes praxis, which then becomes reality; by producing a discourse of "[[Difference (philosophy)|difference]]" Europe was able to maintain its dominance over "The Other", with a binary social relation between the European and The Other, thereby creating and establishing the Subaltern, made possible by excluding The Other from the production of the discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, S. "The West and the Rest: Discourse and Power". ''Race and Racialization: Essential Readings''. Das Gupta, T. et al (eds). Toronto: Canadian Scholars Press. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The voice of the subaltern ==
[[Image:Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak at Goldsmiths College.jpg|thumb|175px|Engaging the Subaltern voice: the philosopher and theorist Gayatri Spivak.]]

[[Gayatri Spivak]]'s line of reasoning was developed in Joanne Sharp's ''Geographies of Post colonialism'' (2008), who proposed that Western intellectuals relegate other, non-Western (African, Asian, Middle Eastern) forms of "knowing", of acquiring knowledge of the world, to the margins of intellectual discourse, by re-formulating these forms of knowing as myth and as folklore. To be heard and known, the subaltern must adopt Western ways of knowing, of thought, reasoning, and language; because of such [[Westernization]], a subaltern people can never express their ways of knowing (thought, reasoning, language) and instead must conform expression of their non-Western knowledge of colonial life to Western ways of knowing the world.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Joanne  ''Geographies of Postcolonialism'', Chapter 6: Can the Subaltern Speak? SAGE Publications, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Subalterns' abandonment of culturally customary ways of thinking and the subsequent adoption of Western ways of thinking are necessary in many situations. The subordinated can be heard by oppressors only by speaking the language of the rulers; thus, intellectual and cultural filters of conformity muddle the true voice of the subaltern. For example, in [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Colonial Latin America]], non-elites must conform to the colonial culture and use the filters of religion and servitude, in the language, when addressing the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Imperial]] rulers. To make their appeals to the crown effective, slaves and natives would address the rulers in ways that might mask their own ways of speaking.

Early modern historian [[Fernando Coronil]] said that the goal of the investigator must be "to listen to the subaltern subjects, and to interpret what I hear" and to engage them and interact with their voices. We cannot ascend to a position of dominance over the voice, subjugating its words to the meanings we desire to attribute to them. That is simply another form of discrimination. The power to narrate somebody's story is a heavy task, and we must be cautious and aware of the complications involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coronil|first=Fernando|title=Listening to the Subaltern: The Poetics of Neocolonial States|jstor=1773104|journal=Poetics Today|year=1994|volume=15|issue=4|series=4|pages=643–658|doi=10.2307/1773104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spivak and [[bell hooks]] question the academic's engagement with the Other, and argue that, to truly engage with the subaltern, the academic would have to remove him or herself as "the expert" at the center of the Us-and-Them binary social relation. Traditionally, the academic wants to know about the subaltern's experiences of colonialism, but does not want to know the subaltern's (own) explanation of his or her experiences of colonial domination.  According to the received view in Western knowledge, hooks argued that a true explanation can come only from the expertise of the academic, thus, the subordinated subject, the subaltern surrender knowledge of colonialism for the use of the Western academic; hooks describes the relationship between the academic and the subaltern:

As a means of constructing a greater historical picture of society, the Subaltern's story is a revealing examination of society; the perspective of the subaltern man and woman, the most powerless people who live within colonial confines; therefore, the investigator of post-colonialism must not assume a lumbering cultural superiority in the course of studying the voices of the oppressed subalterns.

== Development discourse ==
Mainstream development discourse, which is based upon knowledge of colonialism and [[Orientalism]], concentrates upon [[modernization theory]], wherein the modernization of an underdeveloped country ''should'' follow the path to modernization taken (and established) by the developed countries of the West. As such, modernization is characterized by free trade, open markets, capitalist economic systems, and democratic systems of governance, as the means by which a nation should modernize their country ''en route'' to becoming a developed country in the Western style. Therefore, mainstream development discourse concentrates upon the application of universal social and political, economic and cultural policies that would nationally establish such modernization.&lt;ref name="lawson"&gt;Lawson, Victoria. ''Making Development Geography''. UK: Hodder Education, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Making Development Geography'' (2007), Victoria Lawson presents a critique of mainstream development discourse as mere recreation of the Subaltern, which is effected by means of the subaltern being disengaged from other social scales, such as the locale and the community; not considering regional, social class, ethnic group, sexual- and gender-class differences among the peoples and countries being modernized; the continuation of the socio-cultural treatment of the subaltern as a subject of development, as a subordinate who is ignorant of what to do and how to do it; and by excluding the voices of the subject peoples from the formulations of policy and practice used to effect the modernization.&lt;ref name="lawson" /&gt;

As such, the subaltern are peoples who have been silenced in the administration of the colonial states they constitute, they can be heard by means of their political actions, effected in protest against the [[discourse]] of mainstream development, and, thereby, create their own, proper forms of modernization and development. Hence do subaltern social groups create social, political, and cultural movements that contest and disassemble the exclusive claims to power of the Western imperialist powers, and so establish the use and application of local knowledge to create new spaces of opposition and alternative, non-imperialist futures.&lt;ref name="lawson" /&gt;

Systems engineering uses a host of tools that include [[modeling and simulation]], requirements analysis and scheduling to manage complexity.]]

'''Systems engineering''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field of [[engineering]] and [[engineering management]] that focuses on how to design and manage [[complex system]]s over their [[enterprise life cycle|life cycle]]s. At its core, systems engineering utilizes [[systems thinking]] principles to organize this body of knowledge. Issues such as [[requirements engineering]], reliability, [[logistics]], coordination of different teams, testing and evaluation, maintainability and many other [[Discipline (academia)|disciplines]] necessary for successful system development, design, implementation, and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects. Systems engineering deals with work-processes, optimization methods, and [[risk management]] tools in such projects. It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as [[industrial engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[control engineering]], [[software engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[cybernetics]], [[organizational studies]], [[civil engineering]] and [[project management]]. Systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered, and integrated into a whole.

The systems engineering process is a discovery process that is quite unlike a manufacturing process. A manufacturing process is focused on repetitive activities that achieve high quality outputs with minimum cost and time. The systems engineering process must begin by discovering the real problems that need to be resolved, and identifying the most probable or highest impact failures that can occur –  systems engineering involves finding solutions to these problems.

==History==

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need to identify and manipulate the properties of a system as a whole, which in complex engineering projects may greatly differ from the sum of the parts' properties, motivated various industries, especially those developing systems for the U.S. Military, to apply the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

When it was no longer possible to rely on design evolution to improve upon a system and the existing tools were not sufficient to meet growing demands, new methods began to be developed that addressed the complexity directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Systems Engineering | author = Andrew Patrick Sage | publisher=Wiley IEEE | year = 1992 | isbn= 0-471-53639-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continuing evolution of systems engineering comprises the development and identification of new methods and modeling techniques. These methods aid in a better comprehension of the design and developmental control of engineering systems as they grow more complex. Popular tools that are often used in the systems engineering context were developed during these times, including [[Universal Systems Language|USL]], [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], [[Quality function deployment|QFD]], and [[IDEF]]0.

In 1990, a professional society for systems engineering, the ''National Council on Systems Engineering'' (NCOSE), was founded by representatives from a number of U.S. corporations and organizations. NCOSE was created to address the need for improvements in systems engineering practices and education. As a result of growing involvement from systems engineers outside of the U.S., the name of the organization was changed to the [[International Council on Systems Engineering]] (INCOSE) in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[INCOSE]] Resp Group|url=http://www.incose.org/about/genesis.aspx|title=Genesis of INCOSE | accessdate = 2006-07-11 | date=11 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schools in several countries offer graduate programs in systems engineering, and [[continuing education]] options are also available for practicing engineers.&lt;ref name="edu_dir"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[INCOSE]] Education &amp; Research Technical Committee|url=http://www.incose.org/educationcareers/academicprogramdirectory.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221040623/http://www.incose.org/educationcareers/academicprogramdirectory.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-02-21|title=Directory of Systems Engineering Academic Programs|accessdate=2006-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems engineering signifies only an approach and, more recently, a discipline in engineering. The aim of education in systems engineering is to formalize various approaches simply and in doing so, identify new methods and research opportunities similar to that which occurs in other fields of engineering. As an approach, systems engineering is holistic and interdisciplinary in flavour.

===Origins and traditional scope===
The traditional scope of engineering embraces the conception, design, development, production and operation of physical systems. Systems engineering, as originally conceived, falls within this scope. "Systems engineering", in this sense of the term, refers to the distinctive set of concepts, methodologies, organizational structures (and so on) that have been developed to meet the challenges of engineering effective functional systems of unprecedented size and complexity within time, budget, and other constraints. The [[Apollo program]] is a leading example of a systems engineering project.

===Evolution to broader scope===
The use of the term "systems engineer" has evolved over time to embrace a wider, more holistic concept of "systems" and of engineering processes. This evolution of the definition has been a subject of ongoing controversy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.86.7496&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=The Case for Evolving Systems Engineering as a Field within Engineering Systems|author1=Donna Rhodes |author2=Daniel Hastings|publisher=MIT Engineering Systems Symposium|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term continues to apply to both the narrower and broader scope.

Traditional systems engineering was seen as a branch of engineering in the classical sense, that is, as applied only to physical systems, such as spacecraft and aircraft. More recently, systems engineering has evolved to a take on a broader meaning especially when humans were seen as an essential component of a system. Checkland, for example, captures the broader meaning of systems engineering by stating that 'engineering' "can be read in its general sense; you can engineer a meeting or a political agreement."&lt;ref name=Checkland&gt;{{cite book|author=Checkland, Peter|title=Systems Thinking, Systems Practice|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}

Consistent with the broader scope of systems engineering, the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Checkland, Peter|title=Systems Thinking, Systems Practice|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=1999}} 
Pyster, Arthur, ed. 2012. Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge. 1.0 ed: Stephens Institute and the Naval Postgraduate School.&lt;/ref&gt; has defined three types of systems engineering: (1) Product Systems Engineering (PSE) is the traditional systems engineering focused on the design of physical systems consisting of hardware and software. (2) Enterprise Systems Engineering (ESE) pertains to the view of enterprises, that is, organizations or combinations of organizations, as systems. (3) Service Systems Engineering (SSE) has to do with the engineering of service systems. Checkland&lt;ref name=Checkland/&gt; defines a service system as a system which is conceived as serving another system. Most civil infrastructure systems are service systems.

===Holistic view===
Systems engineering focuses on analyzing and eliciting customer needs and required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem, the [[system lifecycle]]. This includes fully understanding all of the [[Project stakeholders|stakeholders]] involved. Oliver et al. claim that the systems engineering process can be decomposed into
* a ''Systems Engineering Technical Process'', and
* a ''Systems Engineering Management Process''.
Within Oliver's model, the goal of the Management Process is to organize the technical effort in the lifecycle, while the Technical Process includes ''assessing available information'', ''defining effectiveness measures'', to ''create a behavior model'', ''create a structure model'', ''perform trade-off analysis'', and ''create sequential build &amp; test plan''.&lt;ref name="Okk"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Oliver | first = David W. | authorlink = | author2 = Timothy P. Kelliher, James G. Keegan, Jr. | year = 1997 | title = Engineering Complex Systems with Models and Objects | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages=85–94| isbn = 0-07-048188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on their application, although there are several models that are used in the industry, all of them aim to identify the relation between the various stages mentioned above and incorporate feedback. Examples of such models include the [[Waterfall model]] and the [[VEE model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gmu.edu/departments/seor/insert/robot/robot2.html | title = The SE VEE | publisher = SEOR, George Mason University | accessdate = 2007-05-26 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071018220159/http://www.gmu.edu/departments/seor/insert/robot/robot2.html | archivedate = 18 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interdisciplinary field===
System development often requires contribution from diverse technical disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Ramo|first = Simon|author2=Robin K. St.Clair |authorlink = Simon Ramo|title = The Systems Approach: Fresh Solutions to Complex Problems Through Combining Science and Practical Common Sense|year = 1998| location = Anaheim, CA | publisher = KNI, Inc.| url = http://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/DOC/SystemsApproach.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; By providing a systems ([[Holism|holistic]]) view of the development effort, systems engineering helps mold all the technical contributors into a unified team effort, forming a structured development process that proceeds from concept to production to operation and, in some cases, to termination and disposal. In an acquisition, the holistic integrative discipline combines contributions and balances tradeoffs among cost, schedule, and performance while maintaining an acceptable level of risk covering the entire life cycle of the item.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| title = [[Defense Acquisition Guide]]book
| chapter = 4. Systems Engineering
| publisher = [[Defense Acquisition University]]
| accessdate = 2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This perspective is often replicated in educational programs, in that systems engineering courses are taught by faculty from other engineering departments, which helps create an interdisciplinary environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://systemseng.cornell.edu/people.html | title = Systems Engineering Program at Cornell University | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://esd.mit.edu/people/faculty.html | title= ESD Faculty and Teaching Staff | publisher = Engineering Systems Division, MIT | accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Managing complexity===
The need for systems engineering arose with the increase in complexity of systems and projects,&lt;ref&gt;Yassine, A. and Braha, D. (2003). [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/CERA.pdf “Complex Concurrent Engineering and the Design Structure Matrix Approach.”] Concurrent Engineering: Research and Applications 11 (3): 165-177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braha, D. and Bar-Yam, Y. (July 2007). [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/MS_July_07_Braha_Bar-yam.pdf “The Statistical Mechanics of Complex Product Development: Empirical and Analytical Results.”] Management Science 53 (7): 1127-1145.&lt;/ref&gt; in turn exponentially increasing the possibility of component friction, and therefore the unreliability of the design. When speaking in this context, complexity incorporates not only engineering systems, but also the logical human organization of data. At the same time, a system can become more complex due to an increase in size as well as with an increase in the amount of data, variables, or the number of fields that are involved in the design. The [[International Space Station]] is an example of such a system.

[[File:STS-134 International Space Station after undocking.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[International Space Station]] is an example of a largely complex system requiring Systems Engineering.]]

The development of smarter control algorithms, microprocessor design, and analysis of environmental systems also come within the purview of systems engineering. Systems engineering encourages the use of tools and methods to better comprehend and manage complexity in systems. Some examples of these tools can be seen here:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://systemseng.cornell.edu/CourseList.html | title=Core Courses, Systems Analysis&amp;nbsp;– Architecture, Behavior and Optimization | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[System architecture]]'',
* ''[[System model]], [[Scientific modelling|Modeling]], and [[Simulation]]'',
* ''[[Mathematical optimization|Optimization]]'',
* ''[[System dynamics]]'',
* ''[[Systems analysis]]'',
* ''[[Statistical analysis]]'',
* ''[[Reliability engineering|Reliability analysis]]'', and
* ''[[Decision making]]''

Taking an [[interdisciplinary]] approach to engineering systems is inherently complex since the [[behavior]] of and interaction among system components is not always immediately [[well defined]] or understood. Defining and characterizing such [[system]]s and subsystems and the interactions among them is one of the goals of systems engineering. In doing so, the gap that exists between informal requirements from users, operators, marketing organizations, and technical specifications is successfully bridged.

===Scope===
[[Image:SE Activities.jpg|left|thumb|400px|The scope of systems engineering activities&lt;ref name="SEF01"&gt;[http://www.dau.mil/publications/publicationsDocs/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf ''Systems Engineering Fundamentals.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131231503/http://www.dau.mil/publications/publicationsdocs/sefguide%2001-01.pdf |date=31 January 2017 }} Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;]]
One way to understand the motivation behind systems engineering is to see it as a method, or practice, to identify and improve common rules that exist within a wide variety of systems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIXP-3VhztgC&amp;pg=PA492&amp;lpg=PA492&amp;dq=One+way+to+understand+the+motivation+behind+systems+engineering+is+to+see+it+as+a+method,+or+practice,+to+identify+and+improve+common+rules+that+exist+within+a+wide+variety+of+systems.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g-qkKHewbh&amp;sig=i52JJqPEkh5acuo_0CWhNGrYKBg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiU0deQmLjSAhVH1CYKHZYnAGsQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%20%22understand%20the%20motivation%20behind%20systems%20engineering%20is%20to%20see%20it%20as%20a%20method,%20or%20practice,%20to%20identify%20and%20improve%20common%20rules%20that%20exist%20within%20a%20wide%20variety%20of%20systems.%22&amp;f=false|title=Complexity and Dynamics|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping this in mind, the principles of systems engineering&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; holism, emergent behavior, boundary, et al.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; can be applied to any system, complex or otherwise, provided [[systems thinking]] is employed at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://incose.org.uk/Downloads/AA01.1.4_Principles%20&amp;%20practices%20of%20SE.pdf | format = PDF | title = Principles and Practices of Systems Engineering | author = Rick Adcock | publisher = INCOSE, UK | accessdate = 2007-06-07 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070615160805/http://incose.org.uk/Downloads/AA01.1.4_Principles%20%26%20practices%20of%20SE.pdf | archivedate = 15 June 2007 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides defense and aerospace, many information and technology based companies, software development firms, and industries in the field of electronics &amp; communications require systems engineers as part of their team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gmu.edu/departments/seor/insert/intro/introsal.html | title=Systems Engineering, Career Opportunities and Salary Information (1994) | publisher=George Mason University | accessdate=2007-06-07 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922213853/http://www.gmu.edu/departments/seor/insert/intro/introsal.html | archivedate=22 September 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis by the INCOSE Systems Engineering center of excellence (SECOE) indicates that optimal effort spent on systems engineering is about 15-20% of the total project effort.&lt;ref name="SEvalue"/&gt; At the same time, studies have shown that systems engineering essentially leads to reduction in costs among other benefits.&lt;ref name="SEvalue"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.incose.org/secoe/0103/ValueSE-INCOSE04.pdf |format=PDF| title=Understanding the Value of Systems Engineering | accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no quantitative survey at a larger scale encompassing a wide variety of industries has been conducted until recently.

Use of methods that allow early detection of possible failures, in [[safety engineering]], are integrated into the design process. At the same time, decisions made at the beginning of a project whose consequences are not clearly understood can have enormous implications later in the life of a system, and it is the task of the modern systems engineer to explore these issues and make critical decisions. No method guarantees today's decisions will still be valid when a system goes into service years or decades after first conceived. However, there are techniques that support the process of systems engineering. Examples include soft systems methodology, [[Jay Wright Forrester]]'s [[System dynamics]] method, and the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML)—all currently being explored, evaluated, and developed to support the engineering decision process.

==Education==
{{Main article|List of systems engineering at universities}}
Education in systems engineering is often seen as an extension to the regular engineering courses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gaudisite.nl/DidacticRecommendationsSESlides.pdf |format=PDF| title=Didactic Recommendations for Education in Systems Engineering | accessdate=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the industry attitude that engineering students need a foundational background in one of the traditional engineering disciplines (e.g., [[aerospace engineering]], [[civil engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[manufacturing engineering]], [[industrial engineering]])—plus practical, real-world experience to be effective as systems engineers. Undergraduate university programs in systems engineering are rare. Typically, systems engineering is offered at the graduate level in combination with interdisciplinary study.

[[INCOSE]] maintains a continuously updated Directory of Systems Engineering Academic Programs worldwide.&lt;ref name="edu_dir"/&gt; As of 2009, there are about 80 institutions in United States that offer 165 undergraduate and graduate programs in systems engineering. Education in systems engineering can be taken as ''Systems-centric'' or ''Domain-centric''.
* ''Systems-centric'' programs treat systems engineering as a separate discipline and most of the courses are taught focusing on systems engineering principles and practice.
* ''Domain-centric'' programs offer systems engineering as an option that can be exercised with another major field in engineering.
Both of these patterns strive to educate the systems engineer who is able to oversee interdisciplinary projects with the depth required of a core-engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://sistemas.unmsm.edu.pe/occa/material/INCOSE-ABET-SE-SF-21Mar06.pdf |format=PDF| title = Perspectives of Systems Engineering Accreditation | publisher= [[INCOSE]] | accessdate=2007-06-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070615160805/http://sistemas.unmsm.edu.pe/occa/material/INCOSE-ABET-SE-SF-21Mar06.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 15 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems engineering topics==
Systems engineering tools are [[strategy|strategies]], [[Procedure (term)|procedures]], and [[wikt:technique|techniques]] that aid in performing systems engineering on a [[project]] or [[Product (business)|product]]. The purpose of these tools vary from database management, graphical browsing, simulation, and reasoning, to document production, neutral import/export and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marc.gatech.edu/events/pde2005/presentations/0.2-jenkins.pdf|format=PDF|title=A Future for Systems Engineering Tools|author=Steven Jenkins|publisher=NASA|page=15|accessdate=2007-06-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926044858/http://www.marc.gatech.edu/events/pde2005/presentations/0.2-jenkins.pdf|archivedate=26 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===System===
There are many definitions of what a [[system]] is in the field of systems engineering. Below are a few authoritative definitions:

* [[ANSI]]/[[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]]-632-1999: "An aggregation of end products and enabling products to achieve a given purpose."&lt;ref&gt;"Processes for Engineering a System", ANSI/EIA-632-1999, [[ANSI]]/[[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]], 1999 [https://web.archive.org/web/20100705203209/http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ANSI%2fEIA-632-1999]&lt;/ref&gt;
* DAU Systems Engineering Fundamentals: "an integrated composite of people, products, and processes that provide a capability to satisfy a stated need or objective."
* [[IEEE]] Std 1220-1998: "A set or arrangement of elements and processes that are related and whose behavior satisfies customer/operational needs and provides for life cycle sustainment of the products."&lt;ref&gt;"Standard for Application and Management of the Systems Engineering Process -Description", IEEE Std 1220-1998, [[IEEE]], 1998 [http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/se/1220-1998_desc.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]] Systems Engineering Handbook: "homogeneous entity that exhibits predefined behavior in the real world and is composed of heterogeneous parts that do not individually exhibit that behavior and an integrated configuration of components and/or subsystems."&lt;ref&gt;"Systems Engineering Handbook", v3.1, [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]], 2007 [http://www.incose.org/ProductsPubs/products/sehandbook.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]]: "A system is a construct or collection of different elements that together produce results not obtainable by the elements alone. The elements, or parts, can include people, hardware, software, facilities, policies, and documents; that is, all things required to produce systems-level results. The results include system level qualities, properties, characteristics, functions, behavior and performance. The value added by the system as a whole, beyond that contributed independently by the parts, is primarily created by the relationship among the parts; that is, how they are interconnected."&lt;ref&gt;"A Consensus of the INCOSE Fellows", [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]], 2006 [http://www.incose.org/practice/fellowsconsensus.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ISO/IEC]] 15288:2008: "A combination of interacting elements organized to achieve one or more stated purposes."&lt;ref&gt;"Systems and software engineering&amp;nbsp;– System life cycle processes", ISO/IEC 15288:2008, [[ISO/IEC]], 2008 [http://www.15288.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[NASA]] Systems Engineering Handbook: "(1) The combination of elements that function together to produce the capability to meet a need. The elements include all hardware, software, equipment, facilities, personnel, processes, and procedures needed for this purpose. (2) The end product (which performs operational functions) and enabling products (which provide life-cycle support services to the operational end products) that make up a system."&lt;ref&gt;"NASA Systems Engineering Handbook", Revision 1, NASA/SP-2007-6105, [[NASA]], 2007 [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080008301_2008008500.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The systems engineering process===
The systems engineering process encompasses all creative, manual and technical activities necessary to define the product and which need to be carried out to convert a system definition to a sufficiently detailed system design specification for product manufacture and deployment. Design and development of a system can be divided into four stages, each with different definitions:&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-55840-0|pp=6-7|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* task definition (informative definition),
* conceptual stage (cardinal definition),
* design stage (formative definition), and
* implementation stage (manufacturing definition).

Depending on their application, tools are used for various stages of the systems engineering process:&lt;ref name="SEF01"/&gt;
:[[Image:Systems Engineering Process.jpg|600px|center]]

===Using models===
[[Abstract model|Model]]s play important and diverse roles in systems engineering. A model can be defined in several
ways, including:&lt;ref name="NASA95"&gt;NASA (1995). "System Analysis and Modeling Issues". In: '' [http://human.space.edu/old/docs/Systems_Eng_Handbook.pdf NASA Systems Engineering Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217005338/http://human.space.edu/old/docs/Systems_Eng_Handbook.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }}'' June 1995. p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An abstraction of reality designed to answer specific questions about the real world
* An imitation, analogue, or representation of a real world process or structure; or
* A conceptual, mathematical, or physical tool to assist a decision maker.
Together, these definitions are broad enough to encompass physical engineering models used in the verification of a system design, as well as schematic models like a [[functional flow block diagram]] and mathematical (i.e., quantitative) models used in the trade study process. This section focuses on the last.&lt;ref name="NASA95"/&gt;

The main reason for using [[mathematical model]]s and [[mathematical diagram|diagrams]] in trade studies is to provide estimates of system effectiveness, performance or technical attributes, and cost from a set of known or estimable quantities. Typically, a collection of separate models is needed to provide all of these outcome variables. The heart of any mathematical model is a set of meaningful quantitative relationships among its inputs and outputs. These relationships can be as simple as adding up constituent quantities to obtain a total, or as complex as a set of differential equations describing the trajectory of a spacecraft in a gravitational field. Ideally, the relationships express causality, not just correlation.&lt;ref name="NASA95"/&gt; Furthermore, key to successful systems engineering activities are also the methods with which these models are efficiently and effectively managed and used to simulate the systems. However, diverse domains often present recurring problems of modeling and simulation for systems engineering, and new advancements are aiming to crossfertilize methods among distinct scientific and engineering communities, under the title of 'Modeling &amp; Simulation-based Systems Engineering'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gianni|editor1-first=Daniele|editor2-last=D'Ambrogio|editor2-first=Andrea|editor3-last=Tolk|editor3-first=Andreas|title=Modeling and Simulation-Based Systems Engineering Handbook|date=4 December 2014|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781466571457|pages=513|edition=1st|url=http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781466571457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modeling formalisms and graphical representations===
Initially, when the primary purpose of a systems engineer is to comprehend a complex problem, graphic representations of a system are used to communicate a system's functional and data requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.vitechcorp.com/resources/technical_papers/200701031634430.CommonGraphicalRepresentations_2002.pdf |format=PDF| title = Relationships between Common Graphical Representations in System Engineering | last=Long | first=Jim| publisher=[[Vitech Corporation]] | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common graphical representations include:
* [[Functional flow block diagram]] (FFBD)
* [[Model-based design]]
* [[Data flow diagram]] (DFD)
* [[N2 chart]]
* [[IDEF0|IDEF0 diagram]]
* [[Use case|Use case diagram]]
* [[Sequence diagram]]
* [[Block diagram]]
* [[Signal-flow graph]]
* [[Universal Systems Language#Formalism for a theory of control|USL function maps and type maps]]
* [[Enterprise architecture framework]]s
* [[Model-based systems engineering]]

A graphical representation relates the various subsystems or parts of a system through functions, data, or interfaces. Any or each of the above methods are used in an industry based on its requirements. For instance, the N2 chart may be used where interfaces between systems is important. Part of the design phase is to create structural and behavioral models of the system.

Once the requirements are understood, it is now the responsibility of a systems engineer to refine them, and to determine, along with other engineers, the best technology for a job. At this point starting with a trade study, systems engineering encourages the use of weighted choices to determine the best option. A [[decision matrix]], or Pugh method, is one way ([[Quality function deployment|QFD]] is another) to make this choice while considering all criteria that are important. The trade study in turn informs the design, which again affects graphic representations of the system (without changing the requirements). In an SE process, this stage represents the iterative step that is carried out until a feasible solution is found. A decision matrix is often populated using techniques such as statistical analysis, reliability analysis, system dynamics (feedback control), and optimization methods.

===Other tools===
[[Systems Modeling Language]] (SysML), a modeling language used for systems engineering applications, supports the specification, analysis, design, verification and validation of a broad range of complex systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sysml.org/docs/specs/OMGSysML-FAS-06-05-04.pdf |format=PDF| title = OMG SysML Specification |page = 23 | publisher=SysML Open Source Specification Project | accessdate=2007-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lifecycle Modeling Language]] (LML), is an open-standard modeling language designed for systems engineering that supports the full lifecycle: conceptual, utilization, support and retirement stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.lifecyclemodeling.org/spec/LML_Specification_1_0.pdf |format=PDF | title = LML Specification |page = 4 | publisher=LML Steering Committee | accessdate=2014-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields and sub-fields==
Many related fields may be considered tightly coupled to systems engineering. The following areas have contributed to the development of systems engineering as a distinct entity:
;Cognitive systems engineering
:Cognitive systems engineering (CSE) is a specific approach to the description and analysis of human-machine systems or [[sociotechnical systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollnagel E. &amp; Woods D. D. (1983). Cognitive systems engineering: New wine in new bottles. International Journal of Man-Machine Studies, 18, 583-600.&lt;/ref&gt; The three main themes of CSE are how humans cope with complexity, how work is accomplished by the use of artifacts, and how human-machine systems and socio-technical systems can be described as joint cognitive systems. CSE has since its beginning become a recognized scientific discipline, sometimes also referred to as [[cognitive engineering]]. The concept of a Joint Cognitive System (JCS) has in particular become widely used as a way of understanding how complex socio-technical systems can be described with varying degrees of resolution. The more than 20 years of experience with CSE has been described extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Hollnagel, E. &amp; Woods, D. D. (2005) Joint cognitive systems: The foundations of cognitive systems engineering. Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woods, D. D. &amp; Hollnagel, E. (2006). Joint cognitive systems: Patterns in cognitive systems engineering. Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Configuration management
:Like systems engineering, [[configuration management]] as practiced in the [[defence industry|defense]] and [[aerospace industry]] is a broad systems-level practice.  The field parallels the taskings of systems engineering; where systems engineering deals with requirements development, allocation to development items and verification, configuration management deals with requirements capture, traceability to the development item, and audit of development item to ensure that it has achieved the desired functionality that systems engineering and/or Test and Verification Engineering have proven out through objective testing.
;Control engineering
:[[Control engineering]] and its design and implementation of [[control systems]], used extensively in nearly every industry, is a large sub-field of systems engineering. The cruise control on an automobile and the guidance system for a ballistic missile are two examples. Control systems theory is an active field of applied mathematics involving the investigation of solution spaces and the development of new methods for the analysis of the control process.
;Industrial engineering
:[[Industrial engineering]] is a branch of [[engineering]] that concerns the development, improvement, implementation and evaluation of integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, material and process. Industrial engineering draws upon the principles and methods of engineering analysis and synthesis, as well as mathematical, physical and social sciences together with the principles and methods of engineering analysis and design to specify, predict, and evaluate results obtained from such systems.
;Interface design
:[[Interface design]] and its specification are concerned with assuring that the pieces of a system connect and inter-operate with other parts of the system and with external systems as necessary. Interface design also includes assuring that system interfaces be able to accept new features, including mechanical, electrical and logical interfaces, including reserved wires, plug-space, command codes and bits in communication protocols.  This is known as [[extensibility]]. [[Human-Computer Interaction]] (HCI) or Human-Machine Interface (HMI) is another aspect of interface design, and is a critical aspect of modern systems engineering. Systems engineering principles are applied in the [[network protocol design principles|design of network protocols]] for [[local-area networks]] and [[wide-area networks]].
;Mechatronic engineering
:[[Mechatronic engineering]], like systems engineering, is a multidisciplinary field of engineering that uses dynamical systems modeling to express tangible constructs. In that regard it is almost indistinguishable from Systems Engineering, but what sets it apart is the focus on smaller details rather than larger generalizations and relationships. As such, both fields are distinguished by the scope of their projects rather than the methodology of their practice.
;Operations research
:[[Operations research]] supports systems engineering. The tools of operations research are used in systems analysis, decision making, and trade studies. Several [[List of systems engineering at universities|schools teach SE courses]] within the [[operations research]] or [[industrial engineering]] department,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; highlighting the role systems engineering plays in complex projects. [[Operations research]], briefly, is concerned with the optimization of a process under multiple constraints.&lt;ref&gt;(see articles for discussion: [http://www.boston.com/globe/search/stories/reprints/operationeverything062704.html] and {{cite web |url=http://www.sas.com/news/sascom/2004q4/feature_tech.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050920174512/http://www.sas.com/news/sascom/2004q4/feature_tech.html |archivedate=20 September 2005 |df=dmy-all }})&lt;/ref&gt;
;Performance engineering
:[[Performance engineering]] is the discipline of ensuring a system meets customer expectations for performance throughout its life. Performance is usually defined as the speed with which a certain operation is executed, or the capability of executing a number of such operations in a unit of time. Performance may be degraded when operations queued to execute is throttled by limited system capacity. For example, the performance of a [[packet-switched network]] is characterized by the end-to-end packet transit delay, or the number of packets switched in an hour. The design of high-performance systems uses analytical or simulation modeling, whereas the delivery of high-performance implementation involves thorough performance testing. Performance engineering relies heavily on [[statistics]], [[queueing theory]] and [[probability theory]] for its tools and processes.
;Program management and project management
:[[Program management]] (or programme management) has many similarities with systems engineering, but has broader-based origins than the engineering ones of systems engineering.  [[Project management]] is also closely related to both program management and systems engineering.
;Proposal engineering
:Proposal engineering is the application of scientific and mathematical principles to design, construct, and operate a cost-effective proposal development system. Basically, proposal engineering uses the "[[systems engineering process]]" to create a cost effective proposal and increase the odds of a successful proposal.
;Reliability engineering
:[[Reliability engineering]] is the discipline of ensuring a system meets customer expectations for reliability throughout its life; i.e., it does not fail more frequently than expected. Next to prediction of failure, it is just as much about prevention of failure. Reliability engineering applies to all aspects of the system. It is closely associated with [[maintainability]], [[availability]] ([[dependability]] or [[RAMS]] preferred by some), and [[logistic engineering|logistics engineering]]. Reliability engineering is always a critical component of safety engineering, as in [[Failure mode and effects analysis|failure modes and effects analysis]] (FMEA) and [[fault tree|hazard fault tree]] analysis, and of [[security engineering]].
;Risk Management
:[[Risk Management]], the practice of assessing and dealing with [[risk]] is one of the interdisciplinary parts of Systems Engineering. In development, acquisition, or operational activities, the inclusion of risk in tradeoff with cost, schedule, and performance features, involves the iterative complex configuration management of traceability and evaluation to the scheduling and requirements management across domains and for the [[system lifecycle]] that requires the interdisciplinary technical approach of systems engineering. Systems Engineering has Risk Management define, tailor, implement, and monitor a structured process for risk management which is integrated to the overall effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www2.mitre.org/work/sepo/toolkits/risk/index.html
|title = Risk Management Toolkit
|publisher = MITRE, SE Process Office
|accessdate = 8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Safety engineering
:The techniques of [[safety engineering]] may be applied by non-specialist engineers in designing complex systems to minimize the probability of safety-critical failures. The "System Safety Engineering" function helps to identify "safety hazards" in emerging designs, and may assist with techniques to "mitigate" the effects of (potentially) hazardous conditions that cannot be designed out of systems.
;Scheduling
: [[Schedule (project management)|Scheduling]] is one of the systems engineering support tools as a practice and item in assessing interdisciplinary concerns under configuration management.  In particular the direct relationship of resources, performance features, and risk to duration of a task or the dependency links among tasks and impacts across the [[system lifecycle]] are systems engineering concerns.
;Security engineering
: [[Security engineering]] can be viewed as an [[interdisciplinary]] field that integrates the [[community of practice]] for control systems design, reliability, safety and systems engineering.  It may involve such sub-specialties as [[authentication]] of system users, system targets and others: people, objects and processes.
;Software engineering
:From its beginnings, [[software engineering]] has helped shape modern systems engineering practice. The techniques used in the handling of the complexities of large software-intensive systems have had a major effect on the shaping and reshaping of the tools, methods and processes of Software Engineering.

'''''Taking Rights Seriously''''' is a 1977 book about the [[philosophy of law]] by [[Ronald Dworkin]]. In this landmark book, Dworkin argues against the dominant philosophy of Anglo-American [[legal positivism]] as presented by [[H. L. A. Hart]] in ''The Concept of Law'' (1961) and [[utilitarianism]] by proposing that rights of the individual against the state exist outside of the written law and function as "trumps" against the interests or wishes of the majority.

Most of the book's chapters are revised versions of previously published papers. In addition to his critique of legal positivism and utilitarian ethics, Dworkin includes important discussions of constitutional interpretation, judicial discretion, [[civil disobedience]], reverse discrimination, [[John Rawls]]' theory of justice, and the Hart–Devlin debate on legislating morality.

A revised edition of book was published in 1978 and includes a lengthy reply by Dworkin to his critics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6208">"'''The Use of Knowledge in Society'''" is a scholarly article written by economist [[Friedrich Hayek]], first published in the September 1945 issue of ''[[The American Economic Review]]''.&lt;ref name="source1"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.kysq.org/docs/Hayek_45.pdf |author=[[Friedrich Hayek]] |title=The Use of Knowledge in Society |date=September 1945 |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=35 |number=4 |page=519–530 |jstor=1809376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="source2"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~vlima/courses/econ200/spring01/hayek.pdf |author=[[Friedrich Hayek]] |title=The Use of Knowledge in Society |date=September 1945 |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=35 |number=4 |page=519–530 |jstor=1809376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/the-use-of-knowledge-in-society|title=The Use of Knowledge in Society - F. A. Hayek|date=1 May 1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written (along with ''The Meaning of Competition'') as a rebuttal to fellow [[economist]] [[Oskar R. Lange]] and his endorsement of a [[planned economy]], it was included among the twelve essays in Hayek's 1948 compendium ''[[Individualism and Economic Order]]''.&lt;ref name="hayek book"&gt;{{cite book | title=Individualism and Economic Order| url=https://books.google.com/?id=5BJcBHuvrsMC&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PP1#PPP1,M1| last=Hayek| first=F. A.| year=1996| publisher=University of Chicago Press| location=Chicago| isbn=0-226-32093-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Argument ==
Hayek's article argues against the establishment of a Central Pricing Board (advocated by Lange) by highlighting the dynamic and organic nature of market [[price|price-fluctuations]], and the benefits of this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="book1"/&gt; He asserts that a centrally planned economy could never match the efficiency of the [[free market|open market]] because what is known by a single agent is only a small fraction of the sum total of knowledge held by all members of society. A decentralized economy thus complements the dispersed nature of information spread throughout society.&lt;ref name="kauffman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.kauffman.org/cwp/appmanager/research/researchDesktop;jsessionid=GVJKUmhZQ8YdcdEwB2DGgQxpdz26X7E3ZO8TfnqSZE7nuSIAUScJ!973872261?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=research_resourceDetail&amp;keep=all&amp;id=Research/Resource/Journal_Article_2848.htm&amp;_nfls=false |title=The use of knowledge in society (abstract)|accessdate=2007-10-05|publisher=Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hayek's words, "The marvel is that in a case like that of a scarcity of one raw material, without an order being issued, without more than perhaps a handful of people knowing the cause, tens of thousands of people whose identity could not be ascertained by months of investigation, are made to use the material or its products more sparingly; that is, they move in the right direction."  The article also discusses the concepts of 'individual equilibrium' and of Hayek's notion of the divide between information which is useful and practicable versus that which is purely scientific or theoretical.&lt;ref name="book1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Carl Menger and his legacy in economics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ir0g_PW5lAYC&amp;pg=PA393 |editor=Bruce J.

== Reception ==
"The Use of Knowledge in Society" was a sensation among economists, setting off a train of work in the economics of information and other areas, including the work of a number of future Nobel Prize winners, as noted by Nobel winner [[Leonid Hurwicz]]. UCLA economist [[Armen Alchian]] remembers the excitement of reading Hayek's essay and stopping fellow economists in the hallway to ask if they had read Hayek's essay. In 2011 "The Use of Knowledge in Society" was selected as one of the top 20 articles published in the ''American Economic Review'' during its first 100 years.&lt;ref name=top&gt;{{Citation|last1=Arrow|first1=Kenneth J.|last2=Bernheim|first2=B.

The '''theory of multiple intelligences''' differentiates [[human intelligence]] into specific 'modalities', rather than seeing intelligence as dominated by a single [[general ability]]. [[Howard Gardner]] proposed this model in his 1983 book ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences''. According to the theory, an intelligence 'modality' must fulfill eight criteria:{{r|Gilman}}
# potential for brain isolation by [[brain damage]],
# place in [[evolutionary history]],
# presence of core operations,
# susceptibility to encoding ([[symbolic expression]]),
# a distinct developmental progression,
# the existence of [[savant syndrome|savant]]s, prodigies and other exceptional people,
# support from [[experimental psychology]], and
# support from [[psychometric]] findings.

Gardner proposed seven abilities that he held to meet these criteria:&lt;ref&gt;Slavin, Robert (2009), ''Educational Psychology'', p. 117, {{ISBN|0-205-59200-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# musical-rhythmic,
# [[Spatial intelligence (psychology)|visual-spatial]],
# [[linguistic intelligence|verbal-linguistic]],
# logical-mathematical,
# bodily-kinesthetic,
# interpersonal,
# intrapersonal
He later suggested that [[Spiritual intelligence|existential]] and [[ethics|moral]] intelligences may also be worthy of inclusion.{{r|Smith}}

Although the distinction between intelligences has been set out in great detail, Gardner opposes the idea of labeling learners to a specific intelligence. Gardner maintains that his theory should "empower learners", not restrict them to one modality of learning.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, W. (2005). Multiple intelligences and instructional technology. ISTE (International Society for Technology Education). {{ISBN|156484188X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gardner, an intelligence is "a biopsychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture."{{sfn|Gardner|1999|p=33-4|ps=}} According to a 2006 study, each of the domains proposed by Gardner involves a blend of the general [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], cognitive abilities other than ''g'', and, in some cases, non-cognitive abilities or personality characteristics.{{r|Response}}

== Intelligence modalities ==

=== Musical-rhythmic and harmonic ===
{{main|Musicality}}

This area has to do with sensitivity to sounds, rhythms, [[Pitch (music)|tones]], and music. People with a high musical intelligence normally have good pitch and may even have [[absolute pitch]], and are able to sing, play musical instruments, and compose music. They have sensitivity to rhythm, pitch, meter, tone, melody or timbre.{{r|PBS}}&lt;ref name=G-H&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gardner, H., &amp; Hatch, T. |title=Multiple intelligences go to school: Educational implications of the theory of multiple intelligences|doi=10.3102/0013189X018008004|url=https://www.sfu.ca/~jcnesbit/EDUC220/ThinkPaper/Gardner1989.pdf|year=1989|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=18|issue=8|page=4|last2=Hatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual-spatial ===
{{main|Spatial intelligence (psychology)}}

This area deals with spatial judgment and the ability to visualize with the mind's eye. Spatial ability is one of the three factors beneath ''g'' in the hierarchical model of intelligence.&lt;ref name=G-H /&gt;

=== Verbal-linguistic ===
{{main|Linguistic intelligence}}

People with high verbal-linguistic intelligence display a facility with words and languages. They are typically good at reading, writing, telling stories and memorizing words along with dates.&lt;ref name=G-H /&gt; Verbal ability is one of the most ''g''-loaded abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Wechsler, D. (1997). [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] III.&lt;/ref&gt;
This type of intelligence is measured with the [[Verbal IQ|Verbal IQ in WAIS-IV]].

=== Logical-mathematical ===
{{further|Reason}}

This area has to do with [[logic]], abstractions, reasoning, numbers and critical thinking.&lt;ref name=G-H /&gt; This also has to do with having the capacity to understand the underlying principles of some kind of causal system.{{r|PBS}} Logical reasoning is closely linked to [[fluid intelligence]] and to [[g factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence (''g'' factor)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=J. B. |title=Human Cognitive Abilities: A Survey of Factor-analytic Studies |year=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521382755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bodily-kinesthetic ===
{{further|Gross motor skill|Fine motor skill}}

The core elements of the bodily-[[Proprioception|kinesthetic]] intelligence are control of one's bodily motions and the capacity to handle objects skillfully.&lt;ref name=G-H /&gt; Gardner elaborates to say that this also includes a sense of timing, a clear sense of the goal of a physical action, along with the ability to train responses.

People who have high bodily-kinesthetic intelligence should be generally good at physical activities such as sports, dance, acting, and making things.

Gardner believes that careers that suit those with high bodily-kinesthetic intelligence include: [[athlete]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[musician]]s, [[actor]]s, [[General contractor|builders]], [[police officer]]s, and [[soldier]]s. Although these careers can be duplicated through virtual simulation, they will not produce the actual physical learning that is needed in this intelligence.{{r|Heteroglossia}}

=== Interpersonal ===
{{main|Social skills}}

In theory, individuals who have high interpersonal intelligence are characterized by their sensitivity to others' moods, feelings, temperaments, motivations, and their ability to cooperate in order to work as part of a group. According to Gardner in ''How Are Kids Smart: Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom'', "Inter- and Intra- personal intelligence is often misunderstood with being extroverted or liking other people..."&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1995). ''How Are Kids Smart: Multiple Intelligences in the Classroom—Administrators' Version''. {{ISBN|1-887943-03-X}}. National Professional Resources Dr. Howard Gardner, along with teachers and students from Fuller Elementary School in Gloucester, MA, discuss the theory behind Multiple Intelligences and demonstrate how they have integrated it into their classrooms and community. (41 minutes)&lt;/ref&gt; Those with high interpersonal intelligence communicate effectively and empathize easily with others, and may be either leaders or followers. They often enjoy discussion and debate." Gardner has equated this with [[emotional intelligence]] of Goleman.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (2015). [https://soundcloud.com/bridging-the-gaps Bridging the Gaps: A Portal for Curious MindsPro Unlimited]. (at 17 minutes). soundcloud.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner believes that careers that suit those with high interpersonal intelligence include [[sales persons]], [[politician]]s, managers, [[teacher]]s, [[lecturer]]s, [[Psychology|counselors]] and [[social worker]]s.{{r|Gardner2002}}

=== Intrapersonal ===
{{further|Introspection}}

This area has to do with introspective and self-reflective capacities. This refers to having a deep understanding of the self; what one's strengths or weaknesses are, what makes one unique, being able to predict one's own reactions or emotions.

=== Naturalistic ===
Not part of Gardner's original seven, naturalistic intelligence was proposed by him in 1995. "If I were to rewrite Frames of Mind today, I would probably add an eighth intelligence – the intelligence of the naturalist. It seems to me that the individual who is readily able to recognize flora and fauna, to make other consequential distinctions in the natural world, and to use this ability productively (in hunting, in farming, in biological science) is exercising an important intelligence and one that is not adequately encompassed in the current list."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gardner, H. |year=1995|title=Reflections on multiple intelligences: Myths and messages|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume= 77|pages= 200–209|url=https://learnweb.harvard.edu/WIDE/courses/files/Reflections.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area has to do with nurturing and relating information to one's natural surroundings.&lt;ref name=G-H /&gt; Examples include classifying natural forms such as animal and plant species and rocks and mountain types. This ability was clearly of value in our evolutionary past as [[Hunter-gatherer|hunters, gatherers]], and [[farmer]]s; it continues to be central in such roles as [[botanist]] or [[chef]].{{r|PBS}}

This sort of ecological receptiveness is deeply rooted in a "sensitive, [[Ethics|ethical]], and [[Holism|holistic]] understanding" of the world and its complexities – including the role of humanity within the greater ecosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Morris, M.|editor = Kincheloe, Joe L.|chapter = Ch. 8. The Eight One: Naturalistic Intelligence|title = Multiple Intelligences Reconsidered|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xVu3bhfSicIC&amp;pg=PR150|year = 2004|publisher = Peter Lang|isbn = 978-0-8204-7098-6|pages = 159–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Existential ===
{{main|Spiritual intelligence}}

Gardner did not want to commit to a spiritual intelligence, but suggested that an "existential" intelligence may be a useful construct, also proposed after the original 7 in his 1999 book.{{sfn|Gardner|1999|p=|ps=}} The hypothesis of an existential intelligence has been further explored by educational researchers.{{r|Tupper}}

=== Additional intelligences ===
On January 13, 2016, Gardner mentioned in an interview with [[Big Think|BigThink]] that he is considering adding the teaching-pedagogical intelligence "which allows us to be able to teach successfully to other people".&lt;ref name="Gard16"&gt;Gardner, Howard. (2016). Intelligence Isn't black and white: There are 8 different kinds. Bigthing. come. [http://bigthink.com/videos/howard-gardner-on-the-eight-intelligences video]. Check minutes 5:00 – 5:55 and 8:16&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, he explicitly refused some other suggested intelligences like humour, cooking and sexual intelligence.&lt;ref name="Gard16"/&gt;

== Critical reception ==
Gardner argues that there is a wide range of [[Cognition|cognitive abilities]], but that there are only very weak correlations among them. For example, the theory postulates that a child who learns to multiply easily is not necessarily more intelligent than a child who has more difficulty on this task. The child who takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or may be looking at and understanding the multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.

[[Intelligence test]]s and [[psychometrics]] have generally found high correlations between different aspects of intelligence, rather than the low correlations which Gardner's theory predicts, supporting the prevailing theory of [[g factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence]] rather than multiple intelligences (MI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Geake|first1 = John|title = Neuromythologies in education|journal = Educational Research|year = 2008|volume = 50|issue = 2|pages = 123–133|doi = 10.1080/00131880802082518}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has been criticized by mainstream psychology for its lack of [[empirical evidence]], and its dependence on subjective judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Waterhouse|first1 = Lynn|title = WATERHOUSE MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES Multiple Intelligences, the Mozart Effect, and Emotional Intelligence: A Critical Review|journal = Educational Psychologist|year = 2006|volume = 41|issue = 4|pages = 207–225|url = http://www.faculty.mun.ca/cmattatall/Multiple_Intelligences_.pdf|doi = 10.1207/s15326985ep4104_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However research by Dweck (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Dweck, C. S. (2006). Mindset: The new psychology of success. Random House Incorporated.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as [[growth mindset|Growth Mindset Theory]], shows that individuals with low correlations can attain also high correlations through intelligence growth. This challenges the notion of fixed or static intelligence levels that general intelligence tests measure. More importantly, it challenges the notion that intelligence test scores are an accurate predictor for future ability.

=== Definition of intelligence ===
One major criticism of the theory is that it is ''[[ad hoc]]'': that Gardner is not expanding the definition of the word "intelligence", but rather denies the existence of [[intelligence]] as traditionally understood, and instead uses the word "intelligence" where other people have traditionally used words like "ability" and "[[aptitude]]". This practice has been criticized by [[Robert J. Sternberg]],{{r|Sternberg1983}}{{r|Sternberg1991}} [[Michael Eysenck|Eysenck]],{{sfn|Eysenck|1994|p=|ps=}} and Scarr.{{r|Scarr}} White (2006) points out that Gardner's selection and application of criteria for his "intelligences" is subjective and arbitrary, and that a different researcher would likely have come up with different criteria.{{sfn|Davis|Christodoulou|Seider|Gardner|2011|p=489|ps=}}

Defenders of MI theory argue that the traditional definition of intelligence is too narrow, and thus a broader definition more accurately reflects the differing ways in which humans think and learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Nikolova, K., &amp; Taneva-Shopova, S.|year = 2007|title = Multiple intelligences theory and educational practice|publisher = Annual Assesn Zlatarov University|volume = 26|issue = 2|pages = 105–109|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264892931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criticisms arise from the fact that Gardner has not provided a test of his multiple intelligences. He originally defined it as the ability to solve problems that have value in at least one culture, or as something that a student is interested in. He then added a [[disclaimer]] that he has no fixed definition, and his classification is more of an artistic judgment than fact:

{{quote|Ultimately, it would certainly be desirable to have an [[algorithm]] for the selection of an intelligence, such that any [[Researcher|trained researcher]] could determine whether a candidate's intelligence met the appropriate criteria. At present, however, it must be admitted that the selection (or rejection) of a candidate's intelligence is reminiscent more of an [[Aesthetics|artistic judgment]] than of a scientific assessment.{{sfn|Gardner|1983|p=|ps=}}}}

Generally, linguistic and logical-mathematical abilities are called intelligences, but artistic, musical, athletic, etc. abilities are not. Gardner argues this causes the former to be needlessly aggrandized. Certain critics are wary of this widening of the definition, saying that it ignores "the connotation of intelligence&amp;nbsp;... [which] has always connoted the kind of thinking skills that makes one successful in school."{{r|Willingham}}

Gardner writes "I balk at the unwarranted assumption that certain human abilities can be arbitrarily singled out as intelligence while others cannot."{{r|Gardner1998}} Critics hold that given this statement, any interest or ability can be redefined as "intelligence". Thus, studying intelligence becomes difficult, because it diffuses into the broader concept of ability or talent. Gardner's addition of the naturalistic intelligence and conceptions of the existential and moral intelligences are seen as the fruits of this diffusion. Defenders of the MI theory would argue that this is simply a recognition of the broad scope of inherent mental abilities, and that such an exhaustive scope by nature defies a one-dimensional classification such as an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ value]].

The theory and definitions have been critiqued by Perry D. Klein as being so unclear as to be [[tautology (logic)|tautologous]] and thus [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]]. Having a high musical ability means being good at music while at the same time being good at music is explained by having a high musical ability.{{r|Klein}}

[[Henri Wallon (psychologist)|Henri Wallon]] shows that « We can not distinguish intelligence from its operations »&lt;ref&gt;According to formulation of Émile Jalley for Henri Wallon in ''Principes de psychologie appliquée'' (Œuvre 1, édition L'Harmattan, 2015) : « On ne saurait distinguer l'intelligence de ses opérations »&lt;/ref&gt;. Yves Richez discovers 10 Natural Operating Modes (Modes Opératoire Naturel - MoON)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Richez |first=Yves |year=2018 |title=corporate talent detection and development|publisher=Wiley Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Richez's studies show a gap between Chinese thought and Western thought. In China, notion of « Being » (Self) and notion of « intelligence » don't exist. Those are greek-Latin inventions (Platon). Instead of intelligence, Chinese speaks of « operating modes ». Thus, Yves Richez doesn't talk of « intelligence » but of « natural operating modes » (Mo.O.N.).

=== Neo-Piagetian criticism ===
[[Andreas Demetriou]] suggests that theories which overemphasize the autonomy of the domains are as simplistic as the theories that overemphasize the role of general intelligence and ignore the domains. He agrees with Gardner that there are indeed domains of intelligence that are relevantly autonomous of each other.{{r|Demetriou2011}} Some of the domains, such as verbal, spatial, mathematical, and [[social intelligence]] are identified by most lines of research in psychology. In Demetriou's theory, one of the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], Gardner is criticized for underestimating the effects exerted on the various domains of intelligences by the various subprocesses that define overall processing efficiency, such as [[speed of processing]], [[executive functions]], [[working memory]], and [[metacognition|meta-cognitive processes]] underlying [[self-awareness]] and [[Self control|self-regulation]]. All of these processes are integral components of general intelligence that regulate the functioning and development of different domains of intelligence.{{sfn|Demetriou|Raftopoulos|2005|p=68|ps=}}

The domains are to a large extent expressions of the condition of the general processes, and may vary because of their constitutional differences but also differences in individual preferences and inclinations. Their functioning both channels and influences the operation of the general processes.{{r|Architecture}}{{r|Efficiency}} Thus, one cannot satisfactorily specify the intelligence of an individual or design effective intervention programs unless both the general processes and the domains of interest are evaluated.{{r|Self-awareness}}{{sfn|Demetriou|Mouyi|Spanoudis|2010|pp=|ps=}}

=== Human adaptation to multiple environments ===
The premise of the multiple intelligences hypothesis, that human intelligence is a collection of specialist abilities, have been criticized for not being able to explain human adaptation to most if not all environments in the world. In this context, humans are contrasted to [[social insect]]s that indeed have a distributed "intelligence" of specialists, and such insects may spread to climates resembling that of their origin but the same species never adapt to a wide range of climates from tropical to temperate by building different types of nests and learning what is edible and what is poisonous. While some such as the [[leafcutter ant]] grow fungi on leaves, they do not cultivate different species in different environments with different farming techniques as human [[agriculture]] does. It is therefore argued that human adaptability stems from a general ability to [[falsifiability|falsify hypotheses]] and make more generally accurate predictions and adapt behavior thereafter, and not a set of specialized abilities which would only work under specific environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Mithen 2005 edition|"Creativity in Human Evolution and Prehistory"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rolf W. Frohlich 2009 edition|"Evolutionary Intelligence: The Anatomy of Human Survival"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IQ tests ===
Gardner argues that IQ tests only measure linguistic and logical-mathematical abilities. He argues the importance of assessing in an "intelligence-fair" manner. While traditional paper-and-pen examinations favor linguistic and logical skills, there is a need for intelligence-fair measures that value the distinct modalities of thinking and learning that uniquely define each intelligence.&lt;ref name=G-H/&gt;

Psychologist [[Alan S. Kaufman]] points out that IQ tests have measured spatial abilities for 70 years.{{sfn|Kaufman|2009|p=|ps=}} Modern IQ tests are greatly influenced by the [[Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory]] which incorporates a general intelligence but also many more narrow abilities. While IQ tests do give an overall IQ score, they now also give scores for many more narrow abilities.{{sfn|Kaufman|2009|p=|ps=}}

=== Lack of empirical evidence ===
According to a 2006 study many of Gardner's "intelligences" correlate with the [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]], supporting the idea of a single dominant type of intelligence. According to the study, each of the domains proposed by Gardner involved a blend of ''g'', of cognitive abilities other than ''g'', and, in some cases, of non-cognitive abilities or of personality characteristics.{{r|Response}}

[[Linda Gottfredson]] (2006) has argued that thousands of studies support the importance of [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) in predicting school and job performance, and numerous other life outcomes. In contrast, empirical support for non-''g'' intelligences is either lacking or very poor. She argued that despite this the ideas of multiple non-''g'' intelligences are very attractive to many due to the suggestion that everyone can be smart in some way.{{r|Gottfredson2006}}

A critical review of MI theory argues that there is little empirical evidence to support it:
{{quote|To date, there have been no published studies that offer evidence of the validity of the multiple intelligences. In 1994 Sternberg reported finding no empirical studies. In 2000 Allix reported finding no [[empirical]] validating studies, and at that time Gardner and Connell conceded that there was "little hard evidence for MI theory" (2000, p. 292). In 2004 Sternberg and Grigerenko stated that there were no validating studies for multiple intelligences, and in 2004 Gardner asserted that he would be "delighted were such evidence to accrue",{{sfn|Gardner|2004|p=214|ps=}} and admitted that "MI theory has few enthusiasts among psychometricians or others of a traditional psychological background" because they require "psychometric or experimental evidence that allows one to prove the existence of the several intelligences."{{sfn|Gardner|2004|p=214|ps=}}{{r|Waterhouse2006}}}}

The same review presents evidence to demonstrate that [[cognitive neuroscience]] research does not support the theory of multiple intelligences:
{{quote|... the human brain is unlikely to function via Gardner's multiple intelligences. Taken together the evidence for the intercorrelations of subskills of IQ measures, the evidence for a shared set of genes associated with mathematics, reading, and g, and the evidence for shared and overlapping "what is it?" and "where is it?" neural processing pathways, and shared neural pathways for language, music, motor skills, and emotions suggest that it is unlikely that each of Gardner's intelligences could operate "via a different set of neural mechanisms" (1999, p. 99). Equally important, the evidence for the "what is it?" and "where is it?" processing pathways, for Kahneman's two decision-making systems, and for adapted cognition modules suggests that these cognitive brain specializations have evolved to address very specific problems in our environment. Because Gardner claimed that the intelligences are innate potentialities related to a general content area, MI theory lacks a rationale for the phylogenetic emergence of the intelligences.{{r|Waterhouse2006}}}}

The theory of multiple intelligences is sometimes cited as an example of [[pseudoscience]] because it lacks empirical evidence or [[falsifiability]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/24174224/Multiple_Intelligences_and_pseudo-_science Multiple Intelligences and pseudo-science] Van der Ploeg, 2016. academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt; though Gardner has argued otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gardner | first = Howard | title = Reflections on Multiple Intelligences: Myths and Messages | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | pages = 200–209 | date = November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in education ==
Gardner defines an intelligence as "bio-psychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture."{{sfn|Gardner|1999|pp=33–34|ps=}} According to Gardner, there are more ways to do this than just through logical and linguistic intelligence. Gardner believes that the purpose of schooling "should be to develop intelligences and to help people reach vocational and avocational goals that are appropriate to their particular spectrum of intelligences. People who are helped to do so, [he] believe[s], feel more engaged and competent and therefore more inclined to serve society in a constructive way."{{efn|This information is based on an informal talk given on the 350th anniversary of Harvard University on 5 September 1986. Harvard Education Review, Harvard Education Publishing Group, 1987, 57, 187–93.}}

Gardner contends that IQ tests focus mostly on logical and linguistic intelligence. Upon doing well on these tests, the chances of attending a prestigious college or university increase, which in turn creates contributing members of society.{{sfn|Gardner|1993|p=6|ps=}} While many students function well in this environment, there are those who do not. Gardner's theory argues that students will be better served by a broader vision of education, wherein teachers use different methodologies, exercises and activities to reach all students, not just those who excel at linguistic and logical intelligence. It challenges educators to find "ways that will work for this student learning this topic".{{sfn|Gardner|1999|p=154|ps=}}

[[James Traub]]'s article in ''The New Republic'' notes that Gardner's system has not been accepted by most academics in intelligence or teaching.{{r|Traub}} Gardner states that "while Multiple Intelligences theory is consistent with much
empirical evidence, it has not been subjected to strong experimental tests&amp;nbsp;... Within the area of education, the applications of the theory are currently being examined in many projects. Our hunches will have to be revised many times in light of actual classroom experience."{{sfn|Gardner|1993|p=33|ps=}}

[[Jerome Bruner]] agreed with Gardner that the intelligences were "useful fictions," and went on to state that "his approach is so far beyond the data-crunching of mental testers that it deserves to be cheered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1983/oct/27/state-of-the-child/ |title=State of the Child |last=Bruner |first=Jerome |publisher=New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Armitage Miller|George Miller]], a prominent cognitive psychologist, wrote in ''The New York Times Book Review'' that Gardner's argument consisted of "hunch and opinion" and Charles Murray and Richard J. Herrnstein in ''[[The Bell Curve]]'' (1994) called Gardner's theory "uniquely devoid of psychometric or other quantitative evidence."{{r|Eberstadt}}

In spite of its lack of general acceptance in the psychological community, Gardner's theory has been adopted by many schools, where it is often conflated with [[learning styles]],{{sfn|Howard-Jones|2010|p=23|ps=}} and hundreds of books have been written about its applications in education.{{sfn|Davis|Christodoulou|Seider|Gardner|2011|p=486|ps=}} Some of the applications of Gardner's theory have been described as "simplistic" and Gardner himself has said he is "uneasy" with the way his theory has been used in schools.{{r|Revell}} Gardner has denied that multiple intelligences are learning styles and agrees that the idea of learning styles is incoherent and lacking in empirical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2013/10/16/howard-gardner-multiple-intelligences-are-not-learning-styles/|title = Howard Gardner: 'Multiple intelligences' are not 'learning styles'|work = The Washington Post|accessdate = 10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner summarizes his approach with three recommendations for educators:  individualize the teaching style (to suit the most effective method for each student), pluralize the teaching (teach important materials in multiple ways), and avoid the term "styles" as being confusing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/10/16/howard-gardner-multiple-intelligences-are-not-learning-styles/|title = Howard Gardner: 'Multiple intelligences' are not 'learning styles'|work = The Washington Post|accessdate = 31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2018 - ''[[National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v.

The law required that licensed centers post visible notices that other options for pregnancy, including abortion, are available from state-sponsored clinics. It also mandated that unlicensed centers post notice of their unlicensed status. The centers, typically run by Christian non-profit groups, challenged the act on the basis that it violated their free speech. After prior reviews in lower courts, the case was brought to the Supreme Court, asking "Whether the disclosures required by the California Reproductive FACT Act violate the protections set forth in the free speech clause of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], applicable to the states through the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/national-institute-family-life-advocates-v-becerra/ National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14213">The '''Toronto School''' is a [[school of thought]] in [[communication theory]] and [[literary criticism]], the principles of which were developed chiefly by scholars at the [[University of Toronto]]. It is characterized by exploration of [[Ancient Greek literature]] and the theoretical view that communication systems create psychological and social states.&lt;ref name="kerckhove_1989"/&gt; The school originated from the works of [[Eric A. Havelock]] and [[Harold Innis]] in the 1930s, and grew to prominence with the contributions of [[Edmund Snow Carpenter]], [[Northrop Frye]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]]. 

Since 1963, the [[McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology]] at the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information]] has carried the mandate for teaching and advancing the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History and Mandate |accessdate=15 November 2008 |publisher=The McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology |url=https://www.utoronto.ca/mcluhan/about_history.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030921091951/http://www.utoronto.ca/mcluhan/about_history.htm |archivedate=21 September 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable contemporary scholars associated with the Toronto School include [[Derrick de Kerckhove]], [[Robert K. Logan]] and [[Barry Wellman]]. 

==History and development==
The Toronto School has been described as "the theory of the primacy of communication in the structuring of human cultures and the structuring of the human mind."&lt;ref name="kerckhove_1989"&gt;Derrick de Kerckhove, "McLuhan and the Toronto School of Communication”, ''Canadian Journal of Communication'' (1989): 73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alphabetEffect"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Alphabet Effect |last=Logan |first=Robert K. |authorlink=Robert K.

Harold Innis' theories of political economy, media and society had a significant influence on [[Media studies|critical media theory]] and communications and with McLuhan, offered groundbreaking Canadian perspectives on the function of communication technologies as key agents in social and historical change. Together, their works advanced a theory of history in which communication is central to social change and transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, (McLuhan Pro and Con), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, McLuhan began the Communication and Culture seminars, funded by the [[Ford Foundation]], at the University of Toronto. As his reputation grew, he received a growing number of offers from other universities and, to keep him, the university created the [[McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology|Centre for Culture and Technology]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/innis-mcluhan/index-e.html | title=ARCHIVED - Introduction - Old Messengers, New Media: The Legacy of Innis and McLuhan - Library and Archives Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He published his first major work during this period: ''The Mechanical Bride'' (1951) was an examination of the effect of advertising on society and culture. He also produced an important journal, ''Explorations'', with Edmund Carpenter, throughout the 1950s. With Innis, Havelock, [[Derrick de Kerckhove]] and [[Barry Wellman]], McLuhan and Carpenter have been characterized as the Toronto School of Communication.&lt;ref&gt;See Blondheim and Watson, ''The Toronto School of Communication Theory: Interpretations, Extensions, Applications''; de Kerckhove, "McLuhan and the Toronto School of Communication"&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan remained at the University of Toronto through 1979, spending much of this time as head of his Centre for Culture and Technology.

==Key works==
===''Empire and Communications''===
{{main|Empire and Communications}}

Published in 1950 by Harold Innis, ''Empire and Communications'' is based on six lectures he delivered at [[Oxford University]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, John Alexander. (2006) ''Marginal Man: The Dark Vision of Harold Innis''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.224.&lt;/ref&gt; The series, known as the Beit Lectures, was dedicated to exploring British imperial history. However, Innis decided to undertake a sweeping historical survey of how communications media influence the rise and fall of empires. He traced the effects of media such as stone, clay, [[papyrus]], [[parchment]] and [[paper]] from ancient to modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (2007) ''Empire and Communications''. Toronto: Dundurn Press, p.23. {{ISBN|978-1-55002-662-7}}. This is the fourth and latest edition of Innis's book. The original edition of 1950 published by Oxford University Press was reissued in 1972 by University of Toronto Press, edited by Mary Quayle Innis with an introduction by Marshall McLuhan. An illustrated third edition was published by Press Porcepic in 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Innis argued that the "bias" of each medium either toward space or toward time helps determine the nature of the civilization in which that medium dominates. "Media that emphasize time are those that are durable in character such as [[parchment]], clay and stone," he writes in his introduction.&lt;ref name="Innis Empire, p.26"&gt;Innis (Empire), p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; These media tend to favour decentralization. "Media that emphasize space are apt to be less durable and light in character, such as papyrus and paper."&lt;ref name="Innis Empire, p.26"/&gt; These media generally favour large, centralized administrations. Innis believed that to persist in time and to occupy space, empires needed to strike a balance between time-biased and space-biased media.&lt;ref name="Innis Empire, p.27"&gt;Innis (Empire), p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a balance is likely to be threatened however, when [[monopolies of knowledge]] exist favouring some media over others.&lt;ref&gt; See, for example, Innis's discussion of the priestly monopoly over writing that undermined the Egyptian empire. Innis (Empire) pp.44-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Bias of Communication''===
{{main|Monopolies of knowledge}}

In his 1947 presidential address to the [[Royal Society of Canada]], Innis remarked: "I have attempted to suggest that Western civilization has been profoundly influenced by communication and that marked changes in communications have had important implications." He went on to mention the evolution of communications media from the [[cuneiform]] script inscribed on clay tablets in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] to the advent of radio in the 20th century. "In each period I have attempted to trace the implications of the media of communication for the character of knowledge and to suggest that a [[monopoly]] or [[oligopoly]] of knowledge is built up to the point that equilibrium is disturbed."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1951) ''The Bias of Communication.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis argued, for example, that a "complex system of writing" such as cuneiform script resulted in the growth of a "special class" of scribes.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Bias) p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The long training required to master such writing ensured that relatively few people would belong to this privileged and aristocratic class. As Paul Heyer explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the beginning, which for Innis means Mesopotamia, there was clay, the reed stylus used to write on it, and the wedge-shaped cuneiform script. Thus did civilization arise, along with an elite group of scribe priests who eventually codified laws. Egypt followed suit, using papyrus, the brush, and hieroglyphic writing.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' (1962)===
{{main|The Gutenberg Galaxy}}

Marshall McLuhan's ''The Mechanical Bride: Folklore of Industrial Man'' (1951) is a study in the field now known as [[popular culture]]. His interest in the critical study of popular culture was influenced by the 1933 book ''Culture and Environment'' by [[F. R. Leavis]] and Denys Thompson, and the title ''The Mechanical Bride'' is derived from a piece by the Dadaist artist, [[Marcel Duchamp]]. 

''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy|The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man]]'' (written in 1961, first published in Canada by [[University of Toronto Press]] in 1962) is a study in the fields of [[orality|oral culture]], [[print culture]], [[cultural studies]], and [[media ecology]]. Throughout the book, McLuhan takes pains to reveal how [[communication technology]] ([[alphabet]]ic writing, the [[printing press]], and the [[electronic media]]) affects [[cognitive]] organization, which in turn has profound ramifications for social organization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...[I]f a new technology extends one or more of our senses outside us into the social world, then new ratios among all of our senses will occur in that particular culture. It is comparable to what happens when a new note is added to a melody. And when the sense ratios alter in any culture then what had appeared lucid before may suddenly become opaque, and what had been vague or opaque will become translucent.&lt;ref&gt;''Gutenberg Galaxy'' 1962, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man'' (1964)===
{{main|Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man}}

McLuhan's most widely known work, ''[[Understanding Media|Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964), is a study in media theory. In it McLuhan proposed that [[Mass media|media]] themselves, not the content they carry, should be the focus of study — popularly quoted as "the medium is the message". McLuhan's insight was that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not by the content delivered over the medium, but by the characteristics of the medium itself. McLuhan pointed to the [[light bulb]] as a clear demonstration of this concept. A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence."&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Media'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; More controversially, he postulated that content had little effect on society — in other words, it did not matter if television broadcasts children's shows or violent programming, to illustrate one example — the effect of television on society would be identical.  He noted that all media have characteristics that engage the viewer in different ways; for instance, a passage in a book could be reread at will, but a movie had to be screened again in its entirety to study any individual part of it.

'''VisualFEA''' is a finite element analysis program running on MS Windows and Mac OS X platforms. The program is being developed and distributed by Intuition Software, Inc. in South Korea, and is used chiefly for structural and geotechnical analysis.  The strongest point of the program is its intuitive and user-friendly usage based on graphical pre- and postprocessing capabilities.  VisualFEA has educational functions for teaching and learning structural mechanics and finite element analysis through graphical simulation. Thus, this program is widely used in college courses related to structural mechanics and finite element method.

==Overview==
VisualFEA is a full-fledged finite element analysis program with many easy-to-use but powerful features, which can be classified largely into four parts: finite element processing, pre-processing, post-processing and educational simulation.  All the functions are integrated into a single executable module, which is a characteristic of the program distinguished from other finite element analysis programs generally composed of multiple modules.  The whole procedure from pre-processing to analysis, and to post-processing can be completed on the spot without launching one program after another, or without pipelining data from one program to another.

==Processing==
VisualFEA can solve the following types of problems.
* Mechanical analysis
:Truss, frame, plane stress, plane strain, axisymmetric, plate bending, shell and 3D solid 
:Linear, material nonlinear or geometric nonlinear analysis
:Static or dynamic analysis
:Construction staged analysis
:Geotechnical analysis (consolidation, slope stability analysis)
* Heat conduction analysis
:Plane, axisymmetric and 3D volume
:Steady state or transient analysis
:Linear or nonlinear material model
:Fire damage analysis
* Seepage analysis
:Plane, axisymmetric and 3D volume
:Steady state or transient analysis
:Confined or unconfined boundary condition
* Coupled analysis
:Heat conduction coupled mechanical analysis
:Seepage coupled mechanical analysis

==Pre-processing==
A finite element model in VisualFEA consists of various objects: curve, primitive surface, node, element and mesh. VisualFEA has its own CAD-like capabilities of creating graphical objects without aid of external programs. VisualFEA can create structured or unstructured meshes in two- or three-dimensional space using the following mesh generation schemes.
* Mapping scheme (lofting, tri-mapping, transfinite mapping, isoparametric mapping)  
* Sweeping scheme (extrusion, translation, rotation, twisting)
* Auto mesh scheme (triangulation, tetrahedronization)
* Mesh treatment (mesh carving, mesh operation, intersection, distortion)
The program has the function to save the generated mesh data in text format for use by other application programs. Other pre-processing capabilities include the following items.
* Definition and assignment of boundary conditions, material properties and element joints, etc.
* Node number or element number optimization
* Handling of element orientation, local coordinate axes

==Post-processing==
VisualFEA has various functions of visualizing the numerical data generated by solving the analysis models.  The most frequently used graphical representation of the data are the contour and vector images.  There are many other forms of graphical representation available in VisualFEA.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y.Lee and S-Y.Ahn, Interactive visualization of elasto-plastic behavior through stress paths and yield surfaces in finite element analysis, Finite Elements in Analysis and Design, 47(2011), pp496-510&lt;/ref&gt;

* Iso-surface
* Sliced plane, parallel plane, cross plane
* Diagram (bending moment diagram, shear force diagram, etc.)
* Curve plotting
* Data probing
* Animation

==Educational Simulation==
VisualFEA can be used as a tool for computer-aided education of structural mechanics and finite element method.  The tools are operated with the user-created modeling data and their ensuing analysis results on the basis of finite element technology.  They are devised to promote the understanding, and to stimulate the interest in the subjects by substantiating the conceptual principles and visually exhibiting the complex computational processes with the aid of interactive computer graphics.  The topics covered by the educational functions are as follows.
* Mathematical relationships of internal forces in rigid frames.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y.Lee and S-Y.Ahn, Finite element implementation for computer-aided education of structural mechanics:Frame analysis, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 22(2014), pp387-409&lt;/ref&gt;
* Geometric properties of an arbitrarily defined member section
* Stresses on the member sections
* Moving load
* Mohr circle and its application to elasto-plastic yielding.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y.Lee, H.R.Ryu and Y.T.Park, Finite element implementation for computer-aided education of structural mechanics:Mohr's circle and its application, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 22(2014), pp494-508&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stress path and yield surface
* Buckling
* Stiffness assembly and solution process in the finite element analysis.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y.Lee, Interactive simulation of finite element equation processing for educational purposes, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 23 (2015) pp157-169, DOI 10.1002/cae.21586&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shape function and interpolation
* Eigen value analysis.&lt;ref&gt;J.Y.Lee, H.R.Ryu, Interactive simulation of eigenmodes for instruction of finite element behavior, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 23 (2015) pp872-886, DOI 10.1002/cae.21659&lt;/ref&gt;
* Concept of adaptive analysis

==VisualFEA/CBT==
VisualFEA/CBT is an educational version of the program&lt;ref&gt;R.D.Cook and Intuition Software, VisualFEA and General User Manual, John Wiley and Son's Inc, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; published by [http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-WILEYASIA2_SEARCH_RESULT.html?query=visualfea John Wiley and Son's Inc.] as a companion program to a textbook&lt;ref&gt;R.D.Cook, D.S.Malkus, M.E.Plesha, R.J.Witt, Concepts and Applications of Finite Element Analysis, 4th ed., John Wiley and Son's Inc, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; on finite element method. The program has the limitation of 3000 nodes that can be handled.

A '''white box system''' is a mechanical system installed in the [[engine room]] of a [[ship]] for controlling and monitoring the engine room [[bilge]] water discharge from the vessel.

The system consists of all vital components for monitoring and controlling the discharge from the vessel's [[Oily Water Separator (marine)|oily water separator]]. The white box includes a stainless steel cage with a locked door. The [[bilge water]] from the oily water separator is pumped through the white box and analyzed by an oil content meter. A flow switch secures that there is flow through the oil content meter and a flow meter counts the accumulated discharged overboard volume. If the door is opened, the oil content exceeds the legal limit of 15 parts per million (PPM) or the flow to the oil content meter is lost the three way valve will immediately redirect the bilge water back to the bilge water holding tank. All components inside the system are connected to a digital recorder mounted in the engine control room that records the oil content, three way valve position, flow through oil content meter, accumulated discharged volume, door position together with the vessels geographical position and time. The chief engineer possesses the key and when locked, the system [[tamper resistance | cannot be tampered with]] and equally importantly provides the evidence that the vessel has been compliant. The recorder data is stored in an encrypted format and can be presented to any official body such as [[Port State Control]], [[United States Coast Guard]], [[Vetting]] or [[Classification society]] officials to prove that the vessel has been compliant to [[MARPOL 73/78]] (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships) or any national regulation, and that no illegal discharge has been made.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3431">The '''Zutistes''' or the '''Circle of Poets Zutiques''' was an informal group of French poets, painters and musicians who met at the Hôtel des Étrangers, at the corner of rue Racine and rue de l'École-de -Medicine, in Paris from September to October 1871.

==Background==

The Zutistes were a fringe spin-off from a splinter group of [[Parnassianism|Parnassians]], known as the "Nasty Fellows" or "Villains Bonshommes",&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; who formed a Parisian dining club at the close of the 1860s. Without having a formal manifesto, and taking their name from the French exclamation of baffled exasperation, ''Zut'',&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129n&lt;/ref&gt; this informal gathering of artists known as the Zutistes gathered around the figure of the pianist [[Ernest Cabaner]], who worked as a bartender/piano player at the hotel.  Anarchic in spirit, they looked back regretfully to the atmosphere of the recently overthrown [[Paris Commune]].&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant figure in the circle was [[Charles Cros]], while other members were later better known, like [[Verlaine]] and [[Rimbaud]].

The most significant trace of the movement came with the re-discovery in the Thirties of the Zutique Album, with some 101 literary entries accompanied by (sometimes pornographic) drawings.&lt;ref&gt;J Austin, ''Proust, Pastiche and the Postmodern'' (2013) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Album==

Shot through with black humour, and riddled with parody and pastiche of contemporary styles and attitudes,&lt;ref&gt;J Austin, ''Proust, Pastiche and the Postmodern'' (2013) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; the album is the best guide to the Circle's membership of some fourteen names.

A central target of the Album's mockery was the recently successful Parnassian [[Francois Coppee]], while other more established figures like [[José-Maria de Heredia]] and [[Leconte de Lisle]] were also in the line of fire.&lt;ref&gt;J Austin, ''Proust, Pastiche and the Postmodern'' (2013) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

This album is in the form of an in-quarto Italian, black hardback cover, about thirty sheets handwritten, the other pages remained blank.

==Aftermath==
Nostalgia for the circle persisted among its members long after its break-up, perhaps as early as the winter of 1871–1872: thus for example the young Zutiste [[Raoul Ponchon]] was one of only seven recipients of Rimbaud's ''[[A Season in Hell]]'';&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Cros in 1883 used "zutique" to name  a new poetry circle; while (perhaps coincidentally) as late as in 1897 the claim would be made that "man is by nature essentially 'zutique'".&lt;ref&gt;Anon, quoted in S Whidden, ''Authority in Crisis in French Literature'' (2016) p 64&lt;/ref&gt;
