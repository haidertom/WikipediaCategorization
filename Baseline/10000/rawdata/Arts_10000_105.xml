[[File:Derain CharingCrossBridge.png|thumb|280px|[[André Derain]], 1906, ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'', co-founder of [[Fauvism]] with [[Matisse]]]]

'''20th-century French art''' developed out of the [[Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]] that dominated French art at the end of the 19th century. The first half of the 20th century in France saw the even more revolutionary experiments of [[Cubism]], [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], artistic movements that would have a major impact on western, and eventually world, art. After World War II, while French artists explored such tendencies as [[Tachism]], [[Fluxus]] and [[New realism]], France's preeminence in the visual arts progressively became eclipsed by developments elsewhere (the United States in particular).

==From Impressionism to World War II==
[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1912, Les Baigneuses, oil on canvas, 105 x 171 cm, Paris, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris.jpg|thumb|left|280px|[[Albert Gleizes]], 1912, ''[[Les Baigneuses (Gleizes)|Les Baigneuses (The Bathers)]]'', oil on canvas, 105 x 171 cm, [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]]]]
The early years of the twentieth century were dominated by [[Neo-Impressionism]] and [[Divisionism]], experiments in colour and content that [[Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]] and [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolism]] had unleashed. The products of the far east also brought new influences. [[Les Nabis]] explored a decorative art in flat plains with a Japanese print graphic approach. From 1904 [[Fauvism|Les Fauves]] exploded in color (much like German [[Expressionism]]).

The influence of African tribal masks led [[Pablo Picasso]] to his ''[[Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' of 1907. Picasso and [[Georges Braque]] (working independently) returned to and refined Cézanne's way of rationally understanding objects in a flat medium; but their experiments in cubism would also lead them to integrate all aspects of day-to-day life: newspapers, musical instruments, cigarettes, wine. Picasso and Braque exhibited their analytical [[Cubism]] under an exclusivity contract at the gallery of [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]], located on a quiet street behind [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]] in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]]. At the same time, [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Fernand Léger]] exhibited alternate forms of Cubism at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] and the [[Salon d'Automne]]; massive exhibitions that brought Cubism to the attention of the general public. These artists had no intention of analyzing and describing mundane objects from daily life—a bowl of fruit, a pipe, violin or guitar—but chose subjects of vast proportion, of provocative social and cultural significance, expressing the dynamic qualities of modern urban life.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund.]&lt;/ref&gt; Cubism in all its phases and divers styles would dominate Europe and America for the next ten years.

[[File:Jean Metzinger, Le goûter, Tea Time, 1911, 75.9 x 70.2 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]], 1911, ''[[Le goûter (Tea Time)]]'', oil on canvas, 75.9 x 70.2 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art. Exhibited at the 1911 Salon d'Automne. Published in ''Fantasio'', 15 Oct. 1911, ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' by Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, 1912, and ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes]]'' by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], 1913, Paris. [[André Salmon]] dubbed this painting "The Mona Lisa of Cubism"]]
[[World War I]] did not stop the dynamic creation of art in France. In 1916 a group of discontents met in a bar in Zurich (the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]]) and create the most radical gesture possible: the anti-art of [[Dada]]. At the same time, [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] were exploring similar notions. At an art show in New York in 1917 Duchamp presented a white porcelain urinal signed ''R. Mutt'' as work of art, becoming the father of the "[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]]".

The killing fields of the war (nearly one-tenth of the French adult male population had been killed or wounded) had made many see the absurdity of existence. This was also the period when the ''[[Lost Generation]]'' took hold: rich Americans enjoying the liberties of [[Prohibition]]-free France in the 1920s and poor G.I.'s going abroad for the first time. Paris was also, for [[African-Americans]], amazingly free of the racial restrictions found in America ([[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Josephine Baker]]).

When Dada reached Paris, it was avidly embraced by a group of young artists and writers who were fascinated with the writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], and particularly by the notion of the [[unconscious mind]]. The provocative spirit of Dada became linked to the exploration of the unconscious mind through the use of [[automatic writing]], chance operations and, in some cases, altered states. The surrealists quickly turned to painting and sculpture. The shock of unexpected elements, the use of [[Frottage (surrealist technique)|Frottage]], [[collage]] and [[decalcomania]], the rendering of mysterious landscapes and dreamscapes were to become the key techniques through the rest of the 1930s.

[[World War II]] ended the feast. Many surrealists like [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Max Ernst]], [[André Breton]] and [[André Masson]] fled occupied France for New York and the States (Duchamp had already been in the U.S. since 1936), but the cohesion and vibrancy were lost in the American city.

==Post World War II==
{{French art history}}
The French art scene immediately after the war went roughly in several directions. There were those who continued in the artistic experiments of the 1930s and 1940s, especially [[Surrealism]] and [[Geometric abstraction]], and there were those associated with [[Lyrical abstraction]], [[Tachisme]], [[Nuagisme]], [[:fr:Art informel|Art Informel]] and ''paysagisme abstrait'' (modes of expression along similar lines as [[Abstract Expressionism]] or [[action painting]] from New York). These artists included [[Wols]], [[Jean Fautrier]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], [[:fr:Jean Degottex|Jean Degottex]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Jean Messagier]] and [[Georges Mathieu]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/youngereuropeanp00swee#page/33/mode/2up Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, ''Younger European painters: a selection'', exhibition catalogue, 2 December 1953 - 21 February 1954]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, [[Jean Dubuffet]] dominated the early post-war years while exploring childlike drawings, graffiti and cartoons in a variety of media in what he called "Art Brut" (see [[Outsider art]]). Meanwhile, [[François Fiedler]] went searching for the perfect combination of color and texture amongst the multitudinous layers of paint that found its way onto his canvas.

In 1960, [[Pierre Restany]] and [[Yves Klein]] founded the [[New Realism]] movement (in French: ''Nouveau Réalisme''), and a joint declaration was signed on October 27, 1960, by nine people: Yves Klein, [[Arman]], [[:fr:Francois Dufrêne|Francois Dufrêne]], [[Raymond Hains]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Pierre Restany]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Jean Tinguely]] and [[Jacques de la Villeglé]]; in 1961 these were joined by [[César Baldaccini|César]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], then [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Gérard Deschamps]]. The artist [[Christo]] joined the group in 1963.  The members of the group saw the world as an image, from which they would take parts and incorporate them into their works. They sought to bring life and art closer together, and has often been compared with ''[[Pop Art]]''. Yves Klein had nude women roll around in blue paint and throw themselves at canvases; Niki de Saint-Phalle created bloated and vibrant plastic figures; Arman gathered together found objects in boxed or resin-coated assemblages; [[César Baldaccini]] produced a series of large compressed object-sculptures (similar to Chamberlain's crushed automobiles); Daniel Spoerri used meals and food as artsistic material.

Associated in various ways with New Realism, the artists of the international [[Fluxus]] movement &amp;ndash; named and loosely organized in 1962 by [[George Maciunas]] (1931–78), a [[Lithuania]]n-born [[United States|American]] artist &amp;ndash; encouraged a [[do it yourself]] aesthetic, and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. Fluxus artists preferred to work with whatever materials were at hand, and either created their own work or collaborated in the creation process with their colleagues. Outsourcing part of the creative process to commercial fabricators was not usually part of Fluxus practice. The most significant French Fluxus artist, [[Ben Vautier]] incorporated [[graffiti]] and found objects into his work.

Other artist in the period include [[Victor Vasarely]] who invented [[Op-Art]] by designing sophisticated optical patterns.

In May 1968, the radical youth movement, through their ''atelier populaire'', produced a great deal of poster-art protesting the moribund policies of president [[Charles de Gaulle]].

==Contemporary art in France==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Many contemporary artists continue to be haunted by the horrors of the war and the specter of the holocaust. [[Christian Boltanski]]'s harrowing installations of the lost and the anonymous are particularly powerful.

The work of his wife [[Annette Messager]], who represented France at the 2005 Venice Biennale, deals with issues of identity and feminism.

The photographer, installation artist and conceptual artist [[Sophie Calle]]'s work is distinguished by its use of arbitrary sets of constraints, and evokes the French literary movement of the 1960s known as [[Oulipo]]. Her work frequently depicts human vulnerability, and examines identity and intimacy. She is recognized for her detective-like ability to follow strangers and investigate their private lives. Her photographic work often includes panels of text of her own writing.

Beginning in the 1980s, the [[Figuration Libre]] movement was constituted around French figures like [[Remi Blanchard]], [[François Boisrond]], [[Robert Combas]], [[Hervé Di Rosa]], [[Richard Di Rosa]] and [[Louis Jammes]]. Between 1982 and 1985, these artists exhibited on several occasions with their American counterparts: [[Keith Haring]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Kenny Scharf]], [[Tseng Kwong Chi]] and inter alia, Crash (exhibitions in New York, London, Pittsburgh, and Paris). The Figuration Libre falls under the prolongation of artists and historical movements whose specificity was the opening to marginalized forms of expression, as the [[Cubism]] had opened with [[African art]] and [[Oceanic art]] (amongst other influences), and "[[Outsider Art|art brut]]" with the children's drawings, [[Pop art]] with advertising and comic strips.

[[Pierre et Gilles]] (Pierre Commoy and Gilles Blanchard), are gay French artistic and romantic partners. They produce highly stylized [[photograph]]s, building their own sets and costumes as well as retouching the photographs. Their work often features images from [[popular culture]], [[gay culture]] including [[porn]] (especially [[James Bidgood (filmmaker)|James Bidgood]]), and [[religion]].

Other important contemporary French artists include Jean-Pierre Raynaud, [[Orlan]], [[Ernest Pignon-Ernest]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[Jean-Marc Bustamante]], [[Pierre Huyghe]], Valérie Mréjen.

'''''An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump''''' is a 1768 [[Oil painting|oil-on-canvas painting]] by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]], one of a number of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s. The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was intimately involved in depicting the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the scientific advances of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. While his paintings were recognized as exceptional by his contemporaries, his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The picture has been owned by the [[National Gallery, London]], since 1863 and is still regarded as a masterpiece of British art. In June 2015 it was on loan to [[Tate Britain]].

The painting depicts a [[natural philosophy|natural philosopher]], a forerunner of the modern scientist, recreating one of [[Robert Boyle]]'s [[vacuum pump|air pump]] experiments, in which a bird is deprived of air, before a varied group of onlookers. The group exhibits a variety of reactions, but for most of the audience scientific curiosity overcomes concern for the bird. The central figure looks out of the picture as if inviting the viewer's participation in the outcome.

==Historical background==
[[File:Robertboyle newexperiments.jpg|thumb|Title page of [[Robert Boyle]]'s ''New Experiments'' of 1660, in which he detailed how to perform the experiment.]]
In 1659, Robert Boyle commissioned the construction of an air pump, then described as a "pneumatic engine", which is known today as a [[vacuum pump]]. The air pump was invented by [[Otto von Guericke]] in 1650, though its cost deterred most contemporary scientists from constructing the apparatus. Boyle, the son of the [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork|Earl of Cork]], had no such concerns—after its construction, he donated the initial 1659 model to the [[Royal Society]] and had a further two redesigned machines built for his personal use. Aside from Boyle's three pumps, there were probably no more than four others in existence during the 1660s: [[Christian Huygens]] had one in [[The Hague]], [[Henry Power]] may have had one at [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], and there may have been pumps at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], and the [[Montmor Academy]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin 1984, pp. 481–520.&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle's pump, which was largely designed to Boyle's specifications and constructed by [[Robert Hooke]], was complicated, temperamental, and problematic to operate. Many demonstrations could only be performed with Hooke on hand, and Boyle frequently left critical public displays solely to Hooke—whose dramatic flair matched his technical skill.&lt;ref&gt;Jardine 2004, pp. 104–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the operational and maintenance obstacles, construction of the pump enabled Boyle to conduct a great many experiments on the properties of air, which he later detailed in his ''New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air, and its Effects, (Made, for the Most Part, in a New Pneumatical Engine)''. In the book, he described in great detail 43 experiments he conducted, on occasion assisted by Hooke, on the effect of air on various phenomena. Boyle tested the effects of "rarified" air on combustion, magnetism, sound, and barometers, and examined the effects of increased [[air pressure]] on various substances. He listed two experiments on living creatures: "Experiment 40," which tested the ability of insects to fly under reduced air pressure, and the dramatic "Experiment 41," which demonstrated the reliance of living creatures on air for their survival. In this attempt to discover something "about the account upon which Respiration is so necessary to the Animals, that Nature hath furnish'd with Lungs", Boyle conducted numerous trials during which he placed a large variety of different creatures, including birds, mice, eels, snails and flies, in the vessel of the pump and studied their reactions as the air was removed.&lt;ref&gt;West 2005, pp. 31–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, he describes an injured [[lark]]:

{{quote|text=…the Bird for a while appear'd lively enough; but upon a greater Exsuction of the Air, she began manifestly to droop and appear sick, and very soon after was taken with as violent and irregular Convulsions, as are wont to be observ'd in Poultry, when their heads are wrung off:  For the Bird threw her self over and over two or three times, and dyed with her Breast upward, her Head downwards, and her Neck awry.&lt;ref name="Boyle"&gt;Boyle 2003, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the time Wright painted his picture in 1768, air pumps were a relatively commonplace scientific instrument, and itinerant "lecturers in [[natural philosophy]]"—usually more showmen than scientists—often performed the "animal in the air pump experiment" as the centrepiece of their public demonstration.&lt;ref name="NP"&gt;Elliott 2000, pp. 61–100.&lt;/ref&gt; These were performed in town halls and other large buildings for a ticket-buying audience, or were booked by societies or for private showings in the homes of the well-off, the setting suggested in both of Wright's demonstration pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 1998, pp. 337–38.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable and respectable of the travelling lecturers was [[James Ferguson (1710–1776)|James Ferguson]] [[Royal Society|FRS]], a Scottish astronomer and probable acquaintance of Joseph Wright (both were friends of [[John Whitehurst]]). Ferguson noted that a "lungs-glass" with a small air-filled bladder inside was often used in place of the animal, as using a living creature was "too shocking to every spectator who has the least degree of humanity".&lt;ref name="RP"&gt;Baird 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}
The full moon in the picture is significant as meetings of the Lunar Circle (renamed the [[Lunar Society]] by 1775) were timed to make use of its light when travelling. 

Wright met Darwin in the early 1760s, probably through their common connection of [[John Whitehurst]], first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when he stayed in the Darwin household for a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King-Hele|first1=Desmond|title=Eramus Darwin. A life of unequalled achievement|date=1999|publisher=Giles de la Mare Publishers Ltd|location=London|isbn=1-900357-08-9|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy and vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary (Polly) Darwin impressed Wright. In the 1980s Eric Evans (National Gallery) suggested that Darwin is the figure in the left foreground who holds a watch. As this composed timekeeper is not consistent with Darwin's flamboyant character, it is more likely that this is Dr [[William Small]]. The attention to timekeeping fits with Dr Small's role as the social secretary for the Lunar Circle. Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765, consistent with this being a meeting in 1767. The profile and wig of this figure are consistent with a contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle.

===Background===
[[File:Godfried Schalcken Kunstbetrachtung.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Candlelit scene by [[Godfried Schalcken]]]]
During his apprenticeship and early career Wright concentrated on portraiture. By 1762, he was an accomplished portrait artist, and his 1764 group portrait ''James Shuttleworth, his Wife and Daughter'' is acknowledged as his first true masterpiece. [[Benedict Nicolson]] suggests that Wright was influenced by the work of [[Thomas Frye]]; in particular by the 18 bust-length [[mezzotint]]s which Frye completed just before his death in 1762. It was perhaps Frye's candlelight images that tempted Wright to experiment with subject pieces. Wright's first attempt, ''A Girl reading a Letter by candlelight with a Young Man looking over her shoulder'' from 1762 or 1763, is a trial in the genre, and is fetching though uncomplicated.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
Wright's ''An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump'' forms part of a series of candlelit [[nocturne]]s that he produced between 1765 and 1768.

There was a [[Chiaroscuro|long history of painting candlelit scenes]] in Western art, although as Wright had not at this date travelled abroad, there remains uncertainty as to what paintings he might have seen in the original, as opposed to [[Old master print|prints]]. Nicolson, who made studies of both Wright and other candlelight painters such as the 17th-century [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]], thought their paintings, among the largest in the style, those most likely to have influenced Wright. However Judy Egerton wonders if he could have seen any, preferring as influences the far smaller works of the [[Leiden fijnschilder]] [[Godfried Schalcken]] (1643–1706), whose reputation was much greater in the early 18th century than subsequently. He had worked in England from 1692 to 1697, and several of his paintings can be placed in English collections in Wright's day.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton (1998), pp. 334–335, and Nicolson (1968), pp. 39–40 and 47. Waterhouse (1978), p. 285, says Wright "must have seen some works by [[Gerard van Honthorst|Honthorst]] or Schalken".&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was the leading expert writing in English, Nicolson does not suggest that Wright is likely to have known of the 17th-century candlelit narrative religious subjects of [[Georges de La Tour]] and [[Trophime Bigot]], which, in their seriousness, are the closest works to Wright that are lit only by candle. The Dutch painters' works and other candlelit scenes by 18th-century English painters such as Henry Morland (father of [[George Morland|George]]) tended instead to exploit the possibilities of semi-darkness for erotic suggestiveness. Some of Wright's own later candlelit scenes were by no means as serious as his first ones, as seen from their titles: ''Two Boys Fighting Over a Bladder'' and ''[[Two Girls Dressing a Kitten by Candlelight]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton (1998), p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight.jpg|thumb|''Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight'' (1765)]]
[[File:Wright of Derby, The Orrery.jpg|thumb|''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]'' (1768)]]

The first of his candlelit masterpieces, ''Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight'', was painted in 1765, and showed three men studying a small copy of the "[[Borghese Gladiator]]". ''Viewing the Gladiator'' was greatly admired; but his next painting, ''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery|A Philosopher giving that Lecture on the Orrery, in which a Lamp is put in place of the Sun]]'' (normally known by the shortened form ''A Philosopher Giving a Lecture on the Orrery'' or just ''The Orrery''), caused a greater stir, as it replaced the Classical subject at the centre of the scene with one of a scientific nature. Wright's depiction of the awe produced by scientific "miracles" marked a break with traditions in which the artistic depiction of such wonder was reserved for religious events,&lt;ref&gt;Brooke 1991, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; since to Wright the marvels of the technological age were as awe-inspiring as the subjects of the great religious paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In both of these works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing sculpture by candlelight, when the contours showed well and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;Guilding, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were an essential part of the display, used to demonstrate [[eclipse]]s. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by [[Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo]] the lighting is normal.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 1998, 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was one of a number of British works challenging the set categories of the rigid, French-dictated [[hierarchy of genres]] in the late 18th century, as other types of painting aspired to be treated as seriously as the costumed [[history painting]] of a Classical or mythological subject. In some respects the ''Orrery'' and ''Air Pump'' subjects resembled [[Conversation piece (paintings)|conversation pieces]], then largely a form of middle-class portraiture, though soon to be given new status when [[Johann Zoffany]] began to paint the royal family in about 1766. Given their solemn atmosphere however, and as it seems none of the figures are intended to be understood as portraits (even if models may be identified), the paintings can not be regarded as conversation pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 215–216, 270, 285–286.&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th-century art historian [[Ellis Waterhouse]] compares these two works to the "''genre serieux''" of contemporary French drama, as defined by [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], a view endorsed by Egerton.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 285–286, and Egerton (1998), p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

An anonymous review from the time called Wright "a very great and uncommon genius in a peculiar way".&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;Solkin 1994, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Orrery'' was painted without a commission, probably in the expectation that it would be bought by [[Washington Shirley, 5th Earl Ferrers|Washington Shirley]], [[Earl Ferrers|5th Earl Ferrers]], an amateur astronomer who had an [[orrery]] of his own, and with whom Wright's friend [[Peter Perez Burdett]] was staying while in [[Derbyshire]]. Figures thought to be portraits of Burdett and Ferrers feature in the painting, Burdett taking notes and Ferrers seated with his son next to the orrery.&lt;ref name="RP" /&gt;
Ferrers purchased the painting for £210, but [[Robert Shirley, 6th Earl Ferrers|the 6th Earl]] auctioned it off, and it is now held by [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name="Lunar"&gt;Uglow 2002, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detail===
[[File:Joseph Wright of Derby. An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump. Detail.Bird.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Detail from the painting]]
''An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump'' followed in 1768, the emotionally charged experiment contrasting with the orderly scene from ''The Orrery''. The painting, which measures 72 by 94½&amp;nbsp;inches (183 by 244&amp;nbsp;cm), shows a grey [[cockatiel]] fluttering in panic as the air is slowly withdrawn from the vessel by the pump. The witnesses display various emotions: one of the girls worriedly watches the fate of the bird, while the other is too upset to observe and is comforted by her father; two gentlemen (one of them dispassionately timing the experiment) and a boy look on with interest, while the young lovers to the left of the painting are absorbed only in each other.&lt;ref name="NMAH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&amp;objkey=216|title=Print of "Experiment of a Bird in the Air Pump"|publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=30 June 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080605124001/http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&amp;objkey=216| archivedate= 5 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientist himself looks directly out of the picture, as if challenging the viewer to judge whether the pumping should continue, killing the bird, or whether the air should be replaced and the cockatiel saved.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;Jones 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from that of the children, little sympathy is directed toward the bird; [[David Solkin]] suggests the subjects of the painting show the dispassionate detachment of the evolving scientific society. Individuals are concerned for each other: the father for his children, the young man for the girl, but the distress of the cockatiel elicits only careful study.&lt;ref name="DS2"&gt;Solkin 1994, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;  To one side of the boy at the rear, the cockatiel's empty cage can be seen on the wall, and to further heighten the drama it is unclear whether the boy is lowering the cage on the pulley to allow the bird to be replaced after the experiment or hoisting the cage back up, certain of its former occupant's death. It has also been suggested that he may be drawing the curtains to block out the light from the full moon. 
[[File:jwstudy.jpg|thumb|An earlier [[oil sketch]] showed the demonstrator in a more reassuring pose. The bird here was a common songbird.&lt;ref&gt;The sketch extends somewhat further to the right than shown here. The full image is reproduced in Egerton (1998), p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Jenny Uglow]] believes that the boy echoes the figure in the last print of [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[The Four Stages of Cruelty]]'' by pointing out the arrogance and potential cruelty of experimentation,&lt;ref name="Lunar" /&gt; while David Fraser also sees the compositional similarities with the audience grouped round a central demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser in Egerton 1990, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The neutral stance of the central character and the uncertain intentions of the boy with the cage were both later ideas: an early study, discovered on the back of a self-portrait, omits the boy and shows the natural philosopher reassuring the girls. In this sketch it is obvious that the bird will survive, and thus the composition lacks the power of the final version.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Wright, who took many of his subjects from English poetry, probably knew the following passage from "The Wanderer" (1729) by [[Richard Savage (poet)|Richard Savage]]:&lt;ref&gt;Egerton 1998, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:So in some Engine, that denies a Vent,
:If unrespiring is some Creature pent,
:It sickens, droops, and pants, and gasps for Breath,
:Sad o'er the Sight swim shad'wy Mists of Death;
:If then kind Air pours powerful in again.
:New Heats, new Pulses quicken ev'ry Vein;
:From the clear'd, lifted, life-rekindled Eye,
:Dispers'd, the dark and dampy Vapours fly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Trinity (Guiard des Moulins, Bible historiale, 15 c.).jpg|thumb|left|The figures beside the bird have been compared to some late medieval [[Trinity|Trinities]].]]

The cockatiel would have been a rare bird at the time, "and one whose life would never in reality have been risked in an experiment such as this".&lt;ref name="Egerton 1998, p. 340"&gt;Egerton 1998, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not become well-known until after it was shown in illustrations to the accounts of the voyages of [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] in the 1770s. Prior to Cook's voyage, cockatiels had been imported only in small numbers as exotic cage-birds. Wright had painted one in 1762 at the home of William Chase, featuring it both in his portrait of Chase and his wife (''Mr &amp; Mrs William Chase'') and a separate study, ''The Parrot''.&lt;ref name="Eg"&gt;Egerton 1990, pp. 58–61.&lt;/ref&gt; In selecting such a rarity for this scientific sacrifice, Wright not only chose a more dramatic subject than the "lungs-glass", but was perhaps making a statement about the values of society in the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="RP" /&gt; The grey plumage of the cockatiel also shows much more effectively in the darkened room than the small dull-coloured bird in Wright's early [[oil sketch]].&lt;ref name="Egerton 1998, p. 340"/&gt; A resemblance has been pointed out between the group of the bird and the two nearest figures and a type of depiction of the [[Trinity]] found in [[Early Netherlandish painting]], where the [[Holy Spirit]] is represented by a dove, to which [[God the Father]] (the philosopher) points, while Christ (the father) gestures in blessing to the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;First mentioned in Busch 1986, in the chapter  "Wright und sein Rekurs auf die christliche Bildtradition," pp. 29–49; Egerton 1998, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the table are various other pieces of equipment that the natural philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, and close to the man seated to the right is a pair of [[Magdeburg hemispheres]], which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment;&lt;ref&gt;Alternatives for the object in the bowl have been suggested, including lungs (which would be relevant to demonstrations of the properties of air)&lt;!-- BBC4 - http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/bird-air-pump.shtml - reports speculation that it could be a lung--&gt;, and Hockney suggests it may even be a ball of sulphur which is creating the illumination for the scene as it reacts with the liquid.&lt;/ref&gt; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a ''[[vanitas]]''—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatiel's struggle for life.&lt;ref name="Eg" /&gt;

===Style===
[[File:Wright-Frye.jpg|thumb|Frye's [[mezzotint]] figures (left) are thought to have inspired those of Wright (right).]]
[[File:Fryewright.jpg|thumb|Frye's chalk drawing (left) was obviously the inspiration for this observer (right).]]
The powerful central light source creates a [[chiaroscuro]] effect. The light illuminating the scene has been described as "so brilliant it could only be the light of revelation".&lt;ref&gt;Kimmelman 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The single source of light is obscured behind the bowl on the table; some hint of a lamp glass can be seen around the side of the bowl, but [[David Hockney]] has suggested that the bowl itself may contain sulphur, giving a powerful single light source that a candle or oil lamp would not.&lt;ref name="Hockney"&gt;Hockney 2001, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In the earlier study a candle holder is visible, and the flame is reflected in the bowl. Hockney [[Hockney-Falco thesis|believes]] that many of the [[Old Master]]s used optical equipment to assist in their painting, and suggests that Wright may have used lenses to transfer the image to paper rather than painting directly from the scene, as he believes the pattern of shadows thrown by the lighting could have been too complicated for Wright to have captured so accurately without assistance.&lt;ref name="Hockney" /&gt; It may be observed, however, that the stand on which the pump is situated casts no shadow on the body of the philosopher, as it could be expected to do.

Wright's ''Air Pump'' was unusual in that it depicted archetypes rather than specific people, though various models for the figures have been suggested. The young lovers may have been based on Thomas Coltman and Mary Barlow, friends of Wright's, whom he later painted in ''Mr and Mrs Thomas Coltman'' (also in the National Gallery) after their marriage in 1769; [[Erasmus Darwin]] has been suggested as the man timing the experiment on the left of the table, and [[John Warltire]], whom Darwin had invited to help with some air pump experiments in real life, as the natural philosopher;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; but Wright never identified any of the subjects or suggested they were based on real people.&lt;ref name="RP" /&gt;

In ''The Orrery'', all the subjects have been identified apart from the philosopher, who has physical similarities to [[Isaac Newton]] but differs enough to make positive identification impossible. Nicolson detects the strong influence of Frye throughout the picture. Particularly striking is the similarity between Frye's mezzotint ''Portrait of a Young Man'' of 1760–1761 and the figure of the boy with his head cocked staring intently at the bird. In 1977, Michael Wynne published one of Frye's chalk drawings from around 1760, ''An old man leaning on a staff'', which is so similar to the observer in the right foreground in Wright's picture to make it impossible that Wright had not seen it. There are other hints of Frye's style in the painting: even the figure of the natural philosopher has touches of Frye's ''Figure with Candle''. Though [[Henry Fuseli]] would later also develop on the style of Frye's work there is no evidence of him having painted anything similar until the early 1780s. So, although he had already been in England at the time the ''Air Pump'' was produced, it is unlikely that he was an influence on Wright.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, pp. 41–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright's scientific paintings adopted elements from the tradition of [[history painting]] but lacked the heroic central action typical of that genre. While ground-breaking, they are regarded as peculiar to Wright, whose unique style has been explained in many ways. Wright's provincial status and ties to the [[Lunar Society]], a group of prominent industrialists, scientists and intellectuals who met regularly in Birmingham between 1765 and 1813, have been highlighted, as well as his close association with and sympathy for the advances made in the burgeoning [[Industrial Revolution]]. Other critics have emphasised a desire to capture a snapshot of the society of the day, in the tradition of William Hogarth but with a more neutral stance that lacks the biting satire of Hogarth's work.&lt;ref name="DS3"&gt;Solkin 1994, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:coltman.jpg|thumb|left|Mr and Mrs Thomas Coltman may have been the model for the two lovers.]]
The scientific subjects of Wright's paintings from this time were meant to appeal to the wealthy scientific circles in which he moved. While never a member himself, he had strong connections with the [[Lunar Society]]: he was friends with members John Whitehurst and Erasmus Darwin, as well as [[Josiah Wedgwood]], who later commissioned paintings from him.&lt;ref name="Paintings"&gt;Harrison 2006, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of the moon in the painting was a nod to their monthly meetings, which were held when the moon was full. Like ''The Orrery'', Wright apparently painted ''Air Pump'' without a commission, and the picture was purchased by Dr [[Benjamin Bates]], who already owned Wright's ''Gladiator''. An Aylesbury physician, patron of the arts and hedonist, Bates was a diehard member of the [[Hellfire Club]] who, despite his excesses, lived to be over 90. Wright's account book shows a number of prices for the painting: P&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;£200 is shown in one place and £210 in another, but Wright had written to Bates asking for £130, stating that the low price "might much injure me in the future sale of my pictures, and when I send you a receipt for the money I shall acknowledge a greater sum."&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Bates ever paid the full amount is not recorded; Wright only notes in his account book that he received £30 in part payment.&lt;ref name="N235"&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Joseph Wright of Derby. An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump. Detail.child.jpg|thumb|Detail of the painting]]

Wright exhibited the painting at the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain|Society of Artists]] exhibition in 1768 and it was re-exhibited before [[Christian VII of Denmark]] in September the same year. Viewers remarked that it was "clever and vigorous",&lt;ref name="Eg" /&gt; while [[Gustave Flaubert]], who saw it on a visit to England in 1865–66, considered it "charmant de naïveté et profondeur".&lt;ref name="Egerton 1998, p. 340"/&gt; It was popular enough that a mezzotint was engraved from it by [[Valentine Green]] which was published by [[John Boydell]] on 24 June 1769,&lt;ref name="N235" /&gt; and initially sold for 15 [[British shilling coin|shillings]]. This was reprinted throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, in increasingly weak impressions.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton 1998, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis Waterhouse called it "one of the wholly original masterpieces of British art".&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 1978, 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Bates, the picture passed to Walter Tyrell; another member of the Tyrell family, Edward, presented it to the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]], London, in 1863, after it had failed to sell at an auction at [[Christie's]] in 1854. The painting was transferred to the [[Tate Gallery]] in 1929, although it was actually on loan to [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]] between 1912 and 1947. It has been lent out for exhibitions to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. in 1976, the [[Nationalmuseum|National Museum of Fine Arts]] in Stockholm in 1979–1980, and Paris ([[Galeries nationales du Grand Palais|Grand Palais]]), New York ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan]]) and the Tate in London in 1990. It was reclaimed by the National Gallery from the Tate in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton 1998, 332. "Egerton (1990)" is the catalogue for the 1990 exhibition ''Wright of Derby'' in London, Paris and New York.&lt;/ref&gt; They describe its condition as good, with minor alterations visible on some figures. It was last cleaned in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton 1998, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

The striking scene has been used as the cover illustration for many books on topics both artistic and scientific. It has even spawned pastiches and parodies: the book cover of ''[[The Science of Discworld]]'', by [[Terry Pratchett]], [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]], is a tribute to the painting by artist [[Paul Kidby]], who replaces Wright's figures with the book's protagonists. [[Shelagh Stephenson]]'s play ''[[An Experiment with an Air Pump]]'', inspired by the painting, was the joint winner of the 1997 [[Peggy Ramsay|Margaret Ramsay Award]] and had its premiere at the [[Royal Exchange, Manchester|Royal Exchange Theatre]], Manchester, in 1998.

Furthermore, there are dozens of [[List of Armenian Genocide memorials|Armenian Genocide memorials]] around the world.

==Art==
[[File:The Artist and His Mother.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Arshile Gorky]]'s ''The Artist and His Mother'' (ca. 1926–36)]]

The earliest example of the Armenian genocide in art was a medal issued in [[St. Petersburg]], signifying Russian sympathy for Armenian suffering. It was struck in 1915, as the [[massacres]] and deportations were still raging. Since then, dozens of medals in different countries have been commissioned to commemorate the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Sarkisyan |first = Henry |title = Works of the State History History Museum of Armenia | volume = IV: Armenian Theme in Russian Medallic Art |publisher = Hayastan | year= 1975 |location = Yerevan |page = 136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings of Armenian-American [[Arshile Gorky]], a seminal figure of [[Abstract Expressionism]], are considered to have been informed by the suffering and loss of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Find Articles | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n2_v84/ai_18004719 | title = Arshile Gorky and the Armenian genocide}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, at age 10, Gorky fled his native [[Van, Turkey|Van]] and escaped to Russian-Armenia with his mother and three sisters, only to have his mother die of starvation in Yerevan in 1919. His two ''The Artist and His Mother'' paintings are based on a photograph with his mother taken in Van.

A case study of Gorky’s 1946-7 painting ''The Plough and the Song'', reveals central themes of suffering and loss, starvation and hunger, and cultural nostalgia emerge through his biomorphic and organically curvilinear forms representing fertility and nature.&lt;ref&gt;The Plough and the Song, 1946. The Art Institute of Chicago. &lt;http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/16964&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Through warm, earthy colors, he paints from memory the fertile agricultural lands of his Armenian homeland. He reconstructs a new hybridized identity in America, an amalgam of visual [[cultural practice]] of modern art of the [[West]] and wistfulness for the rich culture of the [[Armenian people]], reflected in his paintings. ''The Plough and the Song'' materializes the dialectic of violence and culture in the fractured history of the [[Armenian people]].

Scholars on Gorky agree that suffering and loss he experienced during the [[Armenian Genocide]] strongly informed the production of his [[modernist]] paintings in America. Comparisons of Gorky’s ''The Plough and the Song'' (1946-7) with works of his contemporaries in the field of organic biomorphic abstraction reveal the stark manifestation of his experiences of brutality and horror. Gorky appears to have systematically developed the imagery of the canvas such that many of his [[biomorphic]] forms appear to be “bleeding,” alluding to the horrors and violence he witnessed during the [[Armenian Genocide]]. He depicts red far more fluidly, yet systematically. Several of his forms appear to be “bleeding,” given the semblance of a trail of blood that streams down from the inflicted “wounds” on the [[biomorphic]] forms. Gorky makes liberal use of shading to deliberately draw attention to the fact that these ebbing blots and streams of red are, in fact, bleeding wounds. Yet, the ironic truth in the way Gorky seems to weld his nostalgia for [[Armenian culture]] and rich heritage with the violent history of [[genocide]] in a single compositional frame ultimately reflects many Armenians’ own views of their fractured history. There exists a constant dialectic of culture and barbarism in the history of Armenians, where violence persists a theme as constant as the beauty of its culture and its people.

Upon coming to America in the aftermath of the [[Armenian Genocide]], Gorky reconstructed a new identity for himself, as he changed his name from Vosdanig Manoug Adoian to [[Arshile Gorky]], a name that harkened to Georgian-Russian aristocracy and literati of the [[Caucasus region]]. In 1922, he enrolled at the New School of Design in Boston, a city, which at that time, was home to a large immigrant population of [[Armenian Americans]]. When he later moved to [[New York City|New York]], where he taught at the [[National Academy of Design]] and the [[Grand Central School of Art]], Gorky was thrown into the briskly evolving realm of [[modern art]]. As he began to experiment, his early works began to reflect stylistic elements of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Paul Cézanne]].&lt;ref&gt;“Arshile Gorky: Water of the Flowery Mill (56.205.1)”. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 &lt;http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-56.205.1&gt; (October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;    In her book, ''Black Angel: The Life of Archile Gorky'', Armenian scholar Nouritza Matossian likens seminal influences on Gorky’s work and style, including Egyptian [[funerary art]] for pose, [[Cézanne]] for flat planar composition, to [[Picasso]] for form and color, and to [[Ingres]] for simplicity of line and smoothness. These eclectic attributes that seeped into Gorky’s paintings show the struggle he endured to become recognized by drawing influence from other great masters.&lt;ref&gt;Matossian, Nouritza. Black Angel, The Life of Arshile Gorky. Overlook Press, NY 2000, pp. 214–215.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Through the [[Westernization]] of Armenian painting, Gorky was able to communicate his worldview: his memories of the fertile, natural beauty of an idyllic agricultural lifestyle in [[Armenia]], a beauty ruptured by the horrors of bloodshed and violence inflicted by the [[Armenian Genocide]] on his people. His symbolic depictions of bleeding female fertility against a backdrop of chaos communicate his artistic worldview of how the Late [[Ottoman Empire]] ravaged a [[multi-ethnic]] [[empire]] clean of [[ethno-linguistic]] and religious diversity. The dialectic of beauty and violence is one that frames his worldview on representations of genocide through Westernized Armenian painting.

Contemporary Armenian-American artist Mher Khachatryan (b.1983) has produced a series of works to raise awareness of the Armenian Genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artprize.org/61484|title=Dedicated to the victims of 1915 Genocide by Mher Khachatryan|website=www.artprize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Several eyewitness accounts of the events were published, notably those of Swedish missionary [[Alma Johansson]] and U.S. Ambassador [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.]] German medic [[Armin Wegner]] wrote several books about the events he witnessed while stationed in the Ottoman Empire. Years later, having returned to Germany, Wegner was imprisoned for opposing Nazism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hgs.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/8/3/395 Document: Armin T. Wegner's Letter to German Chancellor Adolf Hitler, Berlin, Easter Monday, April 11, 1933 – Gerlach and Templer 8 (3): 395 – Holocaust and Genocide Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; and his books were [[Nazi book burnings|burnt]] by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|place=DE |url=http://www.aktion-patenschaften.de/autoren/w02.htm |publisher=Aktion Patenschaften für verbrannte Bücher |title=Autorenseite Wegners |language=de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521100038/http://www.aktion-patenschaften.de/autoren/w02.htm |archivedate=2008-05-21 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the best known literary work on the Armenian Genocide is [[Franz Werfel]]'s 1933 ''[[The Forty Days of Musa Dagh]]''. It was a bestseller that became particularly popular among the youth of the Jewish ghettos during the Nazi era.&lt;ref name="Auron2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yair Auron|title=The banality of indifference: Zionism &amp; the Armenian genocide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnUR4hSTb8gC&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=26 February 2012|year=2000|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-7658-0881-3|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |302–4}} Armenian American writer [[William Saroyan]] emphasized the Armenians' ability to survive in his 1935 short story [[The Armenian and the Armenian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shirinian|first=Lorne|title=Writing memory: the search for home in Armenian diaspora literature as cultural practice|year=2000|publisher=Blue Heron Press|location=Kingston, Ontario|isbn=9780920266229|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s 1988 novel ''[[Bluebeard (book)|Bluebeard]]'' features the Armenian Genocide as an underlying theme. Other novels incorporating the Armenian Genocide include [[Louis de Berniéres]]' ''Birds without Wings'', [[Edgar Hilsenrath]]'s German-language ''[[The Story of the Last Thought]]'', [[David Kherdian]]'s ''[[The Road from Home]]'' and Polish author [[Stefan Żeromski]]'s 1925 ''[[The Spring to Come]]''. A story in Edward Saint-Ivan's 2006 anthology "The Black Knight's God" includes a fictional survivor of the Armenian Genocide.

A penitence for the genocide is a main theme of ''Stone Dreams (Daş Yuxular)'', the novel of the Azerbaijani author [[Akram Aylisli]], written in 2006. After the publishing the novel Aylisli was harassed by the state and his books were burnt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusrep.ru/article/2014/12/08/aylisli/ “It is like being pregnant all your life..." Akram Aylisli is the first Turkic author who has written a novel about the Armenian Genocide]&lt;/ref&gt;  The novel ''Among the Ashes (Küller Arasında)'', 2009, by the Turkish writer Halil İbrahim Özcan also tells about the Armenian genocide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnnturk.com/2009/kultur.sanat/kitap/12/16/ermeni.tehciri.uzerine.cesur.bir.roman/555690.0/ Ermeni tehciri üzerine cesur bir roman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==
Richard Kalinoski's play, ''Beast on the Moon'', is about two Armenian Genocide survivors. Anoush Baghdassarian's play, "FOUND," is a historical fiction play about a woman's experience through the Armenian Genocide. It follows the story of a girl named Lucine who is searching for her brother who was taken by Turkish soldiers in 1915 at the start of the genocide. The stage is split in half and while "Old Lucine (1925)"  on stage right writes in her diary of memories of the past ten years, "Young Lucine (1915)" acts them out on stage left. It has been performed in New York (2013) and California (2014). In 2014, Devon Jackson's play ''Nameless'' premiered at [[Queen's University]] in the lead-up to the commemoration of the centenary of the Armenian Genocide. A [[verbatim theatre]] play on the Armenian Genocide ''I Wish To Die Singing – Voices From The Armenian Genocide'' by [[Neil McPherson (artistic director)]] played at the [[Finborough Theatre]], [[London]], from 21 April to 16 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/apr/26/i-wish-to-die-singing-searing-account-of-armenian-genocide&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
[[File:Ravished Armenia (1919).webm|thumb|"Ravished Armenia" (sometimes called "Auction of Souls") was produced by the [[American Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief]] in 1919 and is based on the narrative account of [[Aurora Mardiganian]], an Armenian Genocide survivor.]]
[[File:Auction Of Souls-flyer.jpg|thumb|Promotional poster for the 1919 Hollywood film ''[[Ravished Armenia]]'']]

The first film about the Armenian Genocide appeared in 1919, a Hollywood production titled ''[[Ravished Armenia]]''. It resonated with acclaimed director [[Atom Egoyan]], influencing his 2002 ''[[Ararat (film)|Ararat]]''. There are also references in [[Elia Kazan]]'s ''[[America, America]]'' and [[Henri Verneuil]]'s ''[[Mayrig]]''. At the [[Berlin Film Festival]] of 2007 Italian directors [[Paolo and Vittorio Taviani]] presented another film about the events, based on Antonia Arslan's book, ''[[La Masseria Delle Allodole]]'' (''The Farm of the Larks'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,466427,00.html |title = Armenian Genocide at the Berlin Film Festival: "The Lark Farm" Wakens Turkish Ghosts | author = Wolfgang Höbel and Alexander Smoltczyk |publisher = Spiegel Online |accessdate = 2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2003, [[Diamanda Galás]] released the album ''Defixiones, Will and Testament: Orders from the Dead'', an 80-minute memorial tribute to the Armenian, Assyrian and Greek victims of the genocide in Turkey.  "The performance is an angry meditation on genocide and the politically cooperative denial of it, in particular the Turkish and American denial of the Armenian, Assyrian, and Anatolian Greek genocides from 1914 to 1923".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.diamandagalas.com/defixiones/ | title = Defixiones: Orders from the Dead | first = Diamanda | last = Galás | publisher = The San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate = 2007-10-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011191127/http://diamandagalas.com/defixiones/| archivedate= 11 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4445">'''Art competitions''' were held as part of the '''[[1912 Summer Olympics]]''' in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].  It was the first time that art competitions were part of the Olympic program.  Medals were awarded in five categories ([[architecture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]]), for works inspired by sport-related themes.

[[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|Art competitions]] were part of the Olympic program from 1912 to 1948, but were discontinued due to concerns about amateurism and professionalism.  Since 1952, a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games.

At the time, medals were awarded to these artists, but art competitions are no longer regarded as official Olympic events by the [[International Olympic Committee]].  These events do not appear in the IOC medal database,[http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/results/search_r_uk.asp] and these totals are not included in the IOC's medal table for the 1912 Games.[http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/table_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1912]

The Big Draw, formerly the '''Campaign for Drawing,''' is a UK registered charity that promotes [[drawing]] and visual literacy. It was founded in 2000 by the [[Guild of St George]], and is now an independent charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/history.aspx |title=The Campaign For Drawing |publisher=Campaignfordrawing.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100917/http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/history.aspx# |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Draw believes that drawing is a universal language that can unite people across generations, backgrounds and borders. It is inspired by the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] artist and writer, [[John Ruskin]], whose mission was not to teach people how to draw, but how to see. An arts [[educational]] [[Charitable organization|charity]], the Campaign demonstrates that drawing is a [[life skill]]: an essential tool for learning, expression and invention. Its [[publications]] for [[teacher]]s and other educators provide comprehensive evidence that drawing supports formal and informal [[learning]].&lt;ref name="campaign"&gt;[http://www.campaignfordrawing.org]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511163743/http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/|date=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nesta.org.uk/the-campaign-for-drawing/ |title=The Campaign for Drawing - Press releases |publisher=NESTA |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213131726/http://www.nesta.org.uk/the-campaign-for-drawing/# |archive-date=2012-02-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=British Broadcasting Corporation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/secretofdrawing/ |title=Arts - The Secret of Drawing |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raeng.org.uk/education/stf/pdf/the_big_draw_2007.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013133744/http://www.raeng.org.uk/education/stf/pdf/the_big_draw_2007.pdf |date=October 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.staffcentral.brighton.ac.uk/clt/projects/bigdraw/bigdraw.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503153730/http://staffcentral.brighton.ac.uk/clt/projects/bigdraw/bigdraw.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 3, 2009 |accessdate=April 1, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charity leads a programme of advocacy, empowerment and engagement, and is the driving force behind The Big Draw Festival – the world’s biggest celebration of drawing.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The charity supports established and emerging artists through The John Ruskin Prize and exhibition, and regular events, awards and competitions.

The Big Draw manages collaborative research projects, campaigns and educational conferences on visual literacy, digital technology and STEAM (Science, Technology, Art, Maths, Science).

==The Big Draw Festival==
The Big Draw charity is the founder and driving force behind The Big Draw Festival, which takes place each year in over 20 countries around the world. 

Events often take place at notable venues throughout the UK including [[The British Museum]], [[The National Gallery]] and [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] as well as schools, community centres, parks and village halls. The 2013 Big Draw highlight event offered visitors 20 different activities in the new Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Previous launches were held at the Natural History Museum, V&amp;A (twice), Trafalgar Square, St Pancras International Station, Welcome Collection and the British Library.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Partnerships==
The Big Draw receives no core funding. Previously, it has been sponsored by bodies as diverse as NESTA, [[Arts Council England]] (ACE), [[Crayola]], [[Daler-Rowney]], Esmée Fairbairn Foundation, Paul Hamlyn Foundation, Barbara Whatmore Charitable Trust, [[Financial Times]], Heritage Lottery Fund, [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]], [[Persil]], [[Puffin]], [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] and [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA), Derwent and Cass Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/funding.aspx |title=The Campaign For Drawing |publisher=Campaignfordrawing.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402145232/http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/funding.aspx# |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ciné-Asie''' (official name: Ciné-Asie Film Institute) is a Montreal-based, [[non-profit]] Film and Media Company that seeks to explore the unique identity of Asian-Canadian media arts and artists. Its mission is to develop and create cinema that empowers people who are marginalized by [[mass media]] and to introduce the Asian cult and genre films to the wider public. Ciné-Asie is involved in many different projects including film contests, [[exhibitions]] and film screenings at the [[Cinémathèque québécoise]].

In 2008, the company [[Ciné-Asie Creatives]] was established under the umbrella of Ciné-Asie. This division of the company is dedicated to the [[international co-production]] of Canadian and Asian films as well as sales and distribution of films between Canada and Asia. Ciné-Asie Creatives is currently developing a co-production [[feature film]] in cooperation with six Asian directors. In addition, Ciné-Asie Creatives acquired the Canadian distribution rights to the Korean films [[Breathless (2009 film)|Breathless]] by [[Yang Ik-june]] and [[My Dear Enemy]] by [[Lee Yoon-ki]].

== History ==
Founded in 1996 as a registered company, Ciné-Asie started its activities in 1997 with the "Three Korean Master Filmmakers" event in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver in collaboration with cinémathèques in Canada and the New York Cultural Center. Between 1998 and 2000 Ciné-Asie hosted monthly Asian and Asian-American film screenings and seminars in partnership with the Cinémathèque Québécoise in Montreal. During this time Ciné-Asie also organized Asian film events at the [[Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada]] and published the bilingual monthly local film newsletter "QuiFaitQuoi" on Asian film and filmmakers from Canada and abroad.

In 1999, Ciné-Asie was incorporated and co-organized "Chinese Cinema, 1933-49" together with [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]] as part of the Film Society of Lincoln. That same year Ciné Asie organized the "Amérasia International Film and Video Festival" in Montreal and started to host monthly social events for the Asian Film and Video Art Society, a support group of Asian-Canadian artists.

After a six-year break Ciné-Asie resumed its work by programming and coordinating Asian-Canadian film screenings at the Asian Heritage Festival for Access-Asie, a non-profit organization in Montreal. In addition, Ciné-Asie intensified its collaboration with the Cinémathèque Québécoise in Montreal by organizing a retrospective of Korean Films in 2006 and of director [[Hong Sang-soo]]'s films in 2007. In 2008 Ciné-Asie also resumed its monthly Asian-Canadian film screenings presented at the Cinémathèque Québécois.

A cist may have been associated with other monuments, perhaps under a [[cairn]] or long [[tumulus|barrow]]. Several cists are sometimes found close together within the same cairn or barrow. Often ornaments have been found within an excavated cist, indicating the wealth or prominence of the interred individual.

[[File:Devil codex Gigas.jpg|thumbnail|right|The ''[[Codex Gigas]]'', 13th century, Bohemia.]]
A '''codex''' ({{IPAc-en|'|k|oʊ|d|ɛ|k|s}}) (from the [[Latin]] ''caudex'' for "trunk of a tree" or ''block of wood'', ''[[book]]''), plural ''codices'' ({{IPAc-en|'|k|ɒ|d|ɪ|s|iː|z}}), is a book constructed of a number of sheets of [[paper]], [[vellum]], [[papyrus]], or similar materials.  The term is now usually only used of [[manuscript]] books, with hand-written contents,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed: Codex: "a manuscript volume"&lt;/ref&gt; but describes the format that is now near-universal for printed books in the Western world.  The book is usually bound by stacking the pages and fixing one edge to a [[bookbinding]], which may just be thicker paper ([[paperback]] or [[softback]]), or with stiff boards, called a [[hardback]], or in elaborate historical examples a [[treasure binding]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

At least in the Western world, the main alternative to the paged codex format for a long document is the continuous [[scroll]], which was the dominant book form in the [[Classical antiquity|ancient world]].  Some codices are continuously folded like a [[concertina]], in particular the [[Maya codices|Maya]] and [[Aztec codices]], which are actually long sheets of paper or animal skin folded into pages.  These do not really meet most current definitions of the "codex" form, but are so called by convention.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] developed the form from wooden [[Wax tablet|writing tablets]]. The gradual replacement of the scroll by the codex has been called the most important advance in book making before the invention of [[Printing press|printing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The codex transformed the shape of the book itself, and offered a form that lasted until present day (and continues to be used alongside [[e-paper]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M., (2011). ''Books: A Living History'', London: Thames &amp; Hudson, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the codex is often associated with the rise of [[Christianity]], which adopted the format for use with the [[Bible]] early on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=38−67}}&lt;/ref&gt; First described by the [[1st-century]] CE Roman poet [[Martial]], who praised its convenient use, the codex achieved numerical parity with the scroll around 300 CE,&lt;ref name=Oxf&gt;"Codex" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium|The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], New York &amp; Oxford, 1991, p. 473. {{ISBN|0195046528}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had completely replaced it throughout what was by then a Christianized [[Greco-Roman world]] by the [[6th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:The War Scroll - Dead Sea Scroll.jpg|thumb|Codices largely replaced scrolls similar to this.]]
The codex provides considerable advantages over other book formats:
* Compactness
* Sturdiness
* Economic use of materials by using both sides ([[recto and verso]])
* Ease of reference (a codex accommodates [[random access]], as opposed to a scroll, which uses [[sequential access]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|pp=45−53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The change from rolls to codices roughly coincides with the transition from [[papyrus]] to [[parchment]] as the preferred writing material, but the two developments are unconnected. In fact, any combination of codices and scrolls with papyrus and parchment is technically feasible and common in the historical record.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The codex began to replace the [[scroll]] almost as soon as it was invented. In [[Egypt]], by the fifth century, the codex outnumbered the scroll by ten to one based on surviving examples. By the sixth century, the scroll had almost vanished as a medium for literature.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Colin H., and Skeat, T.C. (1987), ''The Birth of the Codex''. London: [[Oxford University Press]] for the [[British Academy]], p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically, even modern [[paperback]]s are codices, but publishers and scholars reserve the term for [[manuscript]] (hand-written) books produced from [[Late antiquity]] until the [[Middle Ages]]. The scholarly study of these manuscripts from the point of view of the [[bookbinding]] craft is called [[codicology]]. The study of ancient documents in general is called [[paleography]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==History==
[[File:Wachstafel rem.jpg|thumb|Reproduced Roman-style [[wax tablet]], from which the codex evolved.]]
The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used precursors made of reusable [[Wax tablet|wax-covered tablets of wood]] for taking notes and other informal writings. Two ancient [[polyptych]]s, a ''pentatych'' and ''octotych'', excavated at [[Herculaneum]] used a unique connecting system that presages later sewing on of thongs or cords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carratelli|first=Giovanni Pugliese|title= "L'instrvmentvm Scriptorivm Nei Monumenti Pompeiani Ed Ercolanesi." in Pompeiana. Raccolta di studi per il secondo centenario degli di Pompei.|year=1950|pages=166–78.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]] may have been the first Roman to reduce scrolls to bound pages in the form of a note-book, possibly even as a papyrus codex.&lt;ref&gt;During the [[Gallic Wars]]; Suet. ''Jul.'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#56.6 56.6]; cf. {{Citation|last=Roberts|first= Colin H.|last2=Skeat|first2=Theodore Cressy|author2-link=Theodore Cressy Skeat|title=The Birth of the Codex|place=Oxford|publisher = Oxford University Press|year=1983|page=18 sq.|isbn=0-19-726061-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 1st century AD, a kind of folded parchment notebook called ''pugillares membranei'' in Latin became commonly used for writing in the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Colin H|last2=Skeat|first2=TC|title=The Birth of the Codex|year=1983|publisher=British Academy|location= London|isbn=0-19-726061-6|pages=15–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodore Cressy Skeat]] theorized that this form of notebook was invented in Rome and then spread rapidly to the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skeat|first= T.C.|title=The Collected Biblical Writings of T.C. Skeat.|year=2004|publisher=E.J. Brill |location= Leiden|isbn=90-04-13920-6|page=45|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=td_OLXo4RvkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Collected+Biblical+Writings+of+T.C.+Skeat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20at%20least%20three%20cases&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Codices are described in certain works by the [[Classical Latin]] poet, [[Martial]]. He wrote a series of five [[couplet]]s meant to accompany gifts of literature that Romans exchanged during the festival of [[Saturnalia]]. Three of these books are specifically described by Martial as being in the form of a codex; the poet praises the compendiousness of the form (as opposed to the scroll), as well the convenience with which such a book can be read on a journey. In another poem by Martial, the poet advertises a new edition of his works, specifically noting that it is printed as a codex, taking less space than a scroll and more comfortable to hold in one hand. According to [[Theodore Cressy Skeat]], this might be the first recorded known case of an entire edition of a literary work (not just a single copy) being published in codex form, though it was likely an isolated case and was not a common practice until a much later time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skeat|first= T.C.|title=The Collected Biblical Writings of T.C. Skeat.|year=2004|publisher=E.J. Brill |location= Leiden|isbn=90-04-13920-6|pages=45–46|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=td_OLXo4RvkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Collected+Biblical+Writings+of+T.C.+Skeat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20at%20least%20three%20cases&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his discussion of one of the earliest parchment codices to survive from [[Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt, Eric Turner seems to challenge Skeat's notion when stating, “…its mere existence is evidence that this book form had a prehistory”, and that “early experiments with this book form may well have taken place outside of Egypt.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Eric|title=The Typology of the Early Codex|year=1977|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-8122-7696-1 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early codices of parchment or papyrus appear to have been widely used as personal notebooks, for instance in recording copies of letters sent (Cicero ''Fam.'' 9.26.1). The [[parchment]] notebook pages were commonly washed or scraped for re-use (called a [[palimpsest]]) and consequently, writings in a codex were often considered informal and impermanent.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

As early as the early 2nd century, there is evidence that a codex—usually of [[papyrus]]—was the preferred format among [[Christianity|Christians]]. In the library of the [[Villa of the Papyri]], [[Herculaneum]] (buried in AD 79), all the texts (of Greek literature) are scrolls (see [[Herculaneum papyri]]). However, in the [[Nag Hammadi library]], hidden about AD 390, all texts (Gnostic Christian) are codices. Despite this comparison, a fragment of a non-Christian parchment codex of [[Demosthenes]]' ''De Falsa Legatione'' from [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt demonstrates that the surviving evidence is insufficient to conclude whether Christians played a major or central role in the development of early codices—or if they simply adopted the format to distinguish themselves from [[Jews]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The earliest surviving fragments from codices come from Egypt, and are variously dated (always tentatively) towards the end of the 1st century or in the first half of the 2nd. This group includes the [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], containing part of St John's Gospel, and perhaps dating from between 125 and 160.&lt;ref&gt;Turner ''The Typology of the Early Codex'', U Penn 1977, and Roberts &amp; Skeat ''The Birth of the Codex'' (Oxford University 1983). From Robert A Kraft (see link): "A fragment of a Latin parchment codex of an otherwise unknown historical text dating to about 100 CE was also found at Oxyrhynchus ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 30|P. Oxy. 30]]; see Roberts &amp; Skeat 28). Papyrus fragments of a "Treatise of the Empirical School" dated by its editor to the centuries 1–2 CE is also attested in the Berlin collection (inv. # 9015, Pack\2 # 2355)—Turner, Typology # 389, and Roberts &amp; Skeat 71, call it a "medical manual"".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ezra Codex Amiantinus.jpg|thumb|Early medieval bookcase containing about ten codices depicted in the [[Codex Amiatinus]] ({{circa}} 700).]]
In [[Western culture#Foundations|Western culture]], the codex gradually replaced the scroll. Between the 4th century, when the codex gained wide acceptance, and the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the [[8th century]], many works that were not converted from scroll to codex were lost. The codex improved on the scroll in several ways. It could be opened flat at any page for easier reading, pages could be written on both front and back ([[recto and verso]]), and the protection of durable covers made it more compact and easier to transport.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

The ancients stored codices with spines facing inward, and not always vertically. The spine could be used for the [[incipit]], before the concept of a proper title developed in medieval times. Though most early codices were made of [[papyrus]], papyrus was fragile and supplies from Egypt, the only place where papyrus grew and was made into paper, became scanty. The more durable [[parchment]] and [[vellum]] gained favor, despite the cost.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

[[File:Codex Mendoza folio 37r.jpg|Folio 37 recto|thumb|right|[[Aztec codices|Aztec codex]] of the early 16th c., [[Codex Mendoza]], showing tribute obligations of particular indigenous towns.]]
The codices of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]] (Mexico and Central America) had the same form as the European codex, but were instead made with long folded strips of either fig bark ([[amatl]]) or plant fibers, often with a layer of [[whitewash]] applied before writing. [[New World]] codices were written as late as the 16th century (see [[Maya codices]] and [[Aztec codices]]). Those written before the Spanish conquests seem all to have been single long sheets folded [[concertina]]-style, sometimes written on both sides of the local ''[[amatl]]'' paper. There are significant codices produced in the colonial era, with pictorial and alphabetic texts in Spanish or an indigenous language such as [[Nahuatl]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}

In [[East Asia]], the scroll remained standard for far longer than in the [[Mediterranean]] world. There were intermediate stages, such as scrolls folded [[concertina]]-style and pasted together at the back and books that were printed only on one side of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://idp.bl.uk/education/bookbinding/bookbinding.a4d [[International Dunhuang Project]]—Several intermediate Chinese bookbinding forms from the 10th century].&lt;/ref&gt; This replaced traditional Chinese writing mediums such as [[bamboo and wooden slips]], as well as [[History of silk|silk]] and paper scrolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|page=227|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of the codex in [[History of China|China]] began with folded-leaf [[pamphlet]]s in the [[9th century]], during the late [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907), improved by the 'butterfly' bindings of the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279), the wrapped back binding of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271-1368), the stitched binding of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1368-1644) and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (1644-1912), and finally the adoption of Western-style bookbinding in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"&gt;{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|pages=227–229|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial phase of this evolution, the accordion-folded palm-leaf-style book, most likely came from [[India]] and was introduced to China via [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist missionaries and scriptures]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt;

==From scrolls to codex==
[[File:Codex Aureus Sankt Emmeram.jpg|thumb|The cover of the [[Carolingian]] gospel book ''Codex Aureus of Sankt Emmeram'', produced ca. 870 AD at the [[Palace of Aachen]], during the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles the Bald]].]]
Among the experiments of earlier centuries, scrolls were sometimes unrolled horizontally, as a succession of columns. (The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] are a famous example of this format.) This made it possible to fold the scroll as an accordion. The next step was then to cut the [[Folio (printing)|folios]], sew and glue them at their centers, making it easier to use the [[papyrus]] or [[vellum]] [[Recto and verso|recto-verso]] as with a modern book. Traditional bookbinders would call one of these assembled, trimmed and bound folios a ''codex'' to differentiate it from the ''case,'' which we now know as ''hard cover''. Binding the codex was clearly a different procedure from binding the case.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Preparing a codex==
{{see|Parchment}}
The first stage in creating a codex is to prepare the animal skin. The skin is washed with water and lime, but not together, and it has to soak in the lime for a couple of days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/making/ |title=The Making of a Medieval Book |publisher=The J. Paul Getty Trust |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hair is removed and the skin is dried by attaching it to a frame called a herse.&lt;ref name="Intro"&gt;Clemens, Raymond, and Timothy Graham. Introduction to Manuscript Studies. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The parchment maker attaches the skin at points around the circumference. The skin attaches to the herse by cords. To prevent tearing, the maker wraps the area of the skin attached to the cord around a pebble called a pippin.&lt;ref name="Intro" /&gt; After completing that, the maker uses a crescent shaped knife called a ''lunarium'' or ''lunellum'' to remove any remaining hairs. Once the skin completely dries, the maker gives it a deep clean and processes it into sheets. The number of sheets from a piece of skin depends on the size of the skin and the final product dimensions. For example, the average calfskin can provide three and half medium sheets of writing material. This can be doubled when folded into two conjoint leaves, also known as a ''bifolium''. Historians have found evidence of manuscripts where the scribe wrote down the medieval instructions now followed by modern membrane makers.&lt;ref name="daniel"&gt;Thompson, Daniel. "Medieval Parchment-Making." The Library 16, no. 4 (1935).&lt;/ref&gt; Defects can often be found in the membrane, whether from the original animal, human error during the preparation period, or from when the animal was killed. Defects can also appear during the writing process. Unless it is kept in perfect condition, defects can also appear later in the life of a manuscript.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

===Preparation of the pages for writing===
[[File:Codex Manesse 193r - Albrecht von Rapperswil.jpg|thumb|Manuscript, [[Codex Manesse]]. Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered.]]
First the membrane must be prepared. The first step is to set up the quires. The quire is a group of several sheets put together. Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham point out, in "Introduction to Manuscript Studies", that "the quire was the scribe’s basic writing unit throughout the Middle Ages":&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"Pricking is the process of making holes in a sheet of parchment (or membrane) in preparation of it ruling. The lines were then made by ruling between the prick marks...The process of entering ruled lines on the page to serve as a guide for entering text. Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered and with vertical bounding lines that marked the boundaries of the columns."&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Forming the quire===
From the Carolingian period and all the way up to the Middle Ages, different styles of folding the quire came about. For example, in mainland Europe throughout the Middle Ages, the quire was put into a system in which each side folded on to the same style. The hair side met the hair side and the flesh side to the flesh side. This was not the same style used in the British Isles, where the membrane was folded so that it turned out an eight-leaf quire, with single leaves in the third and sixth positions.&lt;ref name="Intro" /&gt; The next stage was tacking the quire. Tacking is when the scribe would hold together the leaves in quire with thread. Once threaded together, the scribe would then sew a line of parchment up the "spine" of the manuscript, as to protect the tacking.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

'''''Confessions of an English Opium-Eater''''' ([[1821 in literature|1821]]) is an [[autobiography|autobiographical]] account written by [[Thomas De Quincey]], about his [[laudanum]]  [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and its effect on his life. The ''Confessions'' was "the first major work De Quincey&lt;!--"De Quincey" is always capitalized--&gt; published and the one which won him fame almost overnight..."&lt;ref&gt;Judson S. Lyon, ''Thomas de Quincey'', New York, Twayne, 1969; p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

First published anonymously in September and October 1821 in the ''[[London Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''London Magazine'', Vol. IV, No. xxi, pp. 293–312, and No. xxii, pp. 353–79.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Confessions'' was released in book form in 1822, and again in 1856, in an edition revised by &lt;!--De is always capitalized in his case--&gt;De Quincey.

==Synopsis==
As originally published,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas De Quincey, ''Confessions of an English Opium Eater'', edited by Alethea Hayter, New York, Penguin Books, 1971, provides the original magazine text.&lt;/ref&gt; De Quincey's account was organized into two parts:&lt;ref&gt;About the structure of the novel based on paradigms, see (in French)  [[:fr:Yann Tholoniat|Yann Tholoniat]], « Thomas de Quincey et le paradigme perdu ». In ''Lectures d'une œuvre'': Confessions of an English Opium-Eater – Thomas de Quincey. Paris, Éditions du Temps, 2003 : 93–106.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part I begins with a notice "To the Reader", to establish the narrative frame: "I here present you, courteous reader, with the record of a remarkable period in my life...." It is followed by the substance of Part I,
** ''Preliminary Confessions'', devoted to the author's childhood and youth, and concentrated upon the emotional and psychological factors that underlay the later opium experiences — especially the period in his late teens that De Quincey spent as a homeless runaway in Oxford Street in London in 1802 and 1803.
* Part II is split into several sections:
** A relatively brief introduction and connecting passage, followed by
** ''The Pleasures of Opium'', which discusses the early and largely positive phase of the author's experience with the drug, from 1804 until 1812;
** ''Introduction to the Pains of Opium'', which delivers a second installment of autobiography, taking De Quincey from youth to maturity; and
** ''The Pains of Opium'', which recounts the extreme of the author's opium experience (up to that time), with insomnia, nightmares, frightening visions, and difficult physical symptoms.
* Another "Notice to the Reader" attempts to clarify the chronology of the whole.

[[File:Cover of Thomas de Quincey's Confessions of an Opium Eater.JPG|thumb|The cover of Thomas De Quincey's book ''Confessions of an Opium-Eater''. This version was published by the Mershon Company in 1898.]]

Though De Quincey was later criticized for giving too much attention to the pleasure of opium and not enough to the harsh negatives of addiction, ''The Pains of Opium'' is in fact significantly longer than ''The Pleasures''. However, even when trying to convey darker truths, De Quincey's language can seem seduced by the compelling nature of the opium experience:

::"The sense of space, and in the end, the sense of time, were both powerfully affected. Buildings, landscapes, &amp;c. were exhibited in proportions so vast as the bodily eye is not fitted to conceive. Space swelled, and was amplified to an extent of unutterable infinity. This, however, did not disturb me so much as the vast expansion of time; I sometimes seemed to have lived for 70 or 100 years in one night; nay, sometimes had feelings representative of a millennium passed in that time, or, however, of a duration far beyond the limits of any human experience."&lt;ref&gt;See Alethea Hayter's Penguin edition, pp. 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
From its first appearance, the literary style of the ''Confessions'' attracted attention and comment. De Quincey was well-read in the English literature of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and assimilated influences and models from Sir [[Thomas Browne]] and other writers. Arguably the most famous and often-quoted passage in the ''Confessions'' is the [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophe]] to opium in the final paragraph of ''The Pleasures'':

::"Oh! just, subtle, and mighty opium! that to the hearts of poor and rich alike, for the wounds that will never heal, and for 'the pangs that tempt the spirit to rebel,' bringest an assuaging balm; eloquent opium! that with thy potent rhetoric stealest away the purposes of wrath; and to the guilty man, for one night givest back the hopes of his youth, and hands washed pure of blood...."

De Quincey modelled this passage on the apostrophe "O eloquent, just and mightie Death!" in Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s ''History of the World''.&lt;ref&gt;Hayter's edition, pp. 83, 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier in ''The Pleasures of Opium'', De Quincey describes the long walks he took through the London streets under the drug's influence:

::"Some of these rambles led me to great distances; for an opium-eater is too happy to observe the motions of time. And sometimes in my attempts to steer homewards, upon nautical principles, by fixing my eye on the pole-star, and seeking ambitiously for a north-west passage, instead of circumnavigating all the capes and headlands I had doubled in my outward voyage, I came suddenly upon such knotty problems of alleys, such enigmatical entries, and such sphinx's riddles of streets without thoroughfares, as must, I conceive, baffle the audacity of porters, and confound the intellects of hackney-coachmen."&lt;ref&gt;Hayter's edition, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Confessions'' represents De Quincey's initial effort to write what he called "impassioned prose", an effort that he would later resume in ''[[Suspiria de Profundis]]'' (1845) and ''[[The English Mail-Coach]]'' (1849).

==The 1856 revision==
In the early 1850s, De Quincey prepared the first collected edition of his works for publisher James Hogg. For that edition, he undertook a large-scale revision of the ''Confessions'', more than doubling the work's length. Most notably, he expanded the opening section on his personal background, until it consumed more than two-thirds of the whole. Yet he gave the book "a much weaker beginning" and detracted from the impact of the original with digressions and inconsistencies; "the verdict of most critics is that the earlier version is artistically superior".&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

"De Quincey undoubtedly spoiled his masterpiece by revising it... anyone who compares the two will prefer the unflagging vigour and tension of the original version to the tired prosiness of much of the revised one".&lt;ref&gt;Alethea Hayter's Introduction to the Penguin edition, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The ''Confessions'' maintained a place of primacy in De Quincey's literary output, and his literary reputation, from its first publication; "it went through countless editions, with only occasional intervals of a few years, and was often translated. Since there was little systematic study of narcotics until long after his death, De Quincey's account assumed an authoritative status and actually dominated the scientific and public views of the effects of opium for several generations."&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet from the time of its publication, De Quincey's ''Confessions'' was criticized for presenting a picture of the opium experience that was too positive and too enticing to readers. As early as 1823, an anonymous response, ''Advice to Opium Eaters'', was published "to warn others from copying De Quincey."&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Berridge and [[Griffith Edwards]], ''Opium and the People: Opiate Use in Nineteenth-Century England'', New Haven, Yale University Press, 1987; p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The fear of reckless imitation was not groundless: several English writers — [[Francis Thompson]], [[James Thomson (B.V.)|James Thomson]], William Blair, and perhaps [[Branwell Brontë]] — were led to opium use and addiction by De Quincey's literary example.&lt;ref&gt;Berridge and Edwards, p. 53; Lyon, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s 1860 translation and adaptation, ''[[Les paradis artificiels]]'', spread the work's influence further. One of the characters of the Sherlock Holmes story, ''[[The Man with the Twisted Lip]]'' (1891), is an opium addict who began experimenting with the drug as a student after reading the ''Confessions''. De Quincey attempted to address this type of criticism. When the 1821 original was printed in book form the following year, he added an Appendix on the withdrawal process; and he inserted significant material on the medical aspects of opium into his 1856 revision.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, pp. 93–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, De Quincey's ''Confessions'' influenced [[psychology]] and [[abnormal psychology]], and attitudes towards dreams and imaginative literature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alethea Hayter]], ''Opium and the Romantic Imagination: Addiction and Creativity in de Quincey, Coleridge, Baudelaire and Others'', revised edition, Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, Crucible, 1988; pp. 101–31 and ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Confessions of an English Opium-Eater'' also served as inspiration to one of [[Hector Berlioz]]'s most famous pieces, ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} The play ''The Opium Eater'' by [[Andrew Dallmeyer]] was also based on ''Confessions of an English Opium-Eater'',&lt;ref name=Caper&gt;{{cite web|title=Opium Eater by Andrew Dallmeyer|url=http://www.capercailliebooks.co.uk/shop/fairplay-press/opium-eater-by-andrew-dallmeyer/|website=Capercaillie Books|accessdate=23 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150223180854/http://www.capercailliebooks.co.uk/shop/fairplay-press/opium-eater-by-andrew-dallmeyer/|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been published by [[Capercaillie Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsD/dallmeyer-andrew.html|title=ANDREW DALLMEYER|publisher=Doollee The Playwrights Database |date=|accessdate=2014-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://vagabondproductions.weebly.com/miss-julie-reviews.html|title=Miss Julie Fringe Sell Out show 2012|publisher=Vagabond Productions|date=|accessdate=2014-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, [[Vincent Price]] starred in the full-length film ''[[Confessions of an Opium Eater]]'' which was a reimagining of De Quincey's ''Confessions'' by Hollywood producer [[Albert Zugsmith]].

'''Critical Metrics''' was a web-based [[Recommender system|music recommendation service]]. Unlike user-driven sites like [[The Hype Machine]] and [[Pandora (music service)|Pandora]], Critical Metrics featured only expert-generated content. Aggregating reviews and playlists from over 150 publications, both print and online, the site also encompassed historical sources. The site then ranked the songs mathematically, based on the information gathered. With a methodology based in the fields of [[bibliometrics]] and [[sentiment analysis]], Critical Metrics quantified these positive citations and sentiments into indices for media playlisting and consumption.

Streaming audio and [[YouTube]] videos were presented with the original recommendations, along with the option to purchase via [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] or other online retailers. When the site was launched in April 2007, it hosted the streaming music itself. A licensing arrangement with [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] removed the free music, but allowed unlimited listening and playlist-building for Rhapsody subscribers.

Critical Metrics was founded by Joey Anuff, the co-founder of [[Suck.com]] and a former [[VH1]] executive. The site was praised by [[Boing Boing]], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and ''[[Business Week]]''. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' senior music critic [[Ann Powers]] referred to the site as her "favorite snobby top 40 station".

'''Czech folklore''' is the folk tradition which has developed among the [[Czechs|Czech people]] over a number of centuries. Czech folklore was influenced by a mix of [[Christian]] and [[pagan]] customs. Nowadays it is preserved and kept alive by various folklore ensembles uniting members of all ages, from children to seniors, showing their talent during competitions, folklore festivals or other performances. 

The [[Czech Republic]] is divided into a number of ethnographic regions. Each of them has special folklore traditions, songs or costumes and specializes in different [[crafts]]. As a result, Czech folklore provides a diverse source of entertainment.

==Music and dance==
Music played an important part in life of common people or [[peasants]] in the Czech Republic. It offered both means of expression and a vent for their emotions. Resulting music varies not only by the region of its origin but also in the purpose of its use. Therefore, there are myriads of distinct [[folk songs]].

[[File:Ľubomír Párička gra na dudach.webm|thumb|Ľubomír Párička playing bagpipes, Czech Republic]]
Music often addressed everyday issues and was passed down [[Oral tradition|orally]]. From the 19th century onward it was recorded by [[Ethnography|etnographs]]. Traditional celebrations such as '''welcome of the spring''', '''successful harvest''' are still among the occasions traditionally celebrated with songs. More lively themes were used specifically during celebrations, weddings or feasts. [[Funeral]]s and mournful occasions also had their own set of songs and tunes. 

Songs and especially dances were often linked to conscription of Czech young men to the Army; they are called [[Slovácko Verbuňk|“verbuňk”]] in some regions. Conscriptions usually happened during wartimes and these songs have a particular place in Czech folklore music. They are listed by [[UNESCO]] in the List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/archives/multimedia/?s=films_details&amp;id_page=33&amp;id_film=621|title=The Slovacko Verbunk|publisher=NULK|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of instruments associated with Czech folk music, which add to its distinct sound – violin and the [[double bass]]; instruments specific to [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] such as bagpipes [[Dudy|(bock)]], shepherd’s pipe, [[Hammered dulcimer|dulcimer]] and trumpet. 

All of them are still in active use by the folklore groups during their shows.

[[Polka]] dance originated in [[Bohemia]] and still remains an integral part of folklore traditions especially in the western part of the country. Since the 19th century this dance has spread from Bohemia to many neighbouring European countries as well as overseas.

==Traditional Czech celebrations==

In the past, emphasis was placed on changes connected to the four seasons of the year; every season had its own specific traditions. In the [[Spring (season)|spring]], people practiced customs which would ensure health of their crops and future successful [[harvest]]. In the [[winter]], it was most important to protect households and villagers against adverse effects of cold weather and supernatural forces. 

Many Czech regions still hold traditional celebrations, which also revel in folklore music, dance and costumes. Among the most typical is Drowning of Morana, Shrovetide, erecting the maypole, [[Harvest (wine)|grape harvest]] or celebration of Easter. 

* Drowning of [[Marzanna|Morana]]: to celebrate the end of the winter, young girls in a number of villages build an effigy of a woman out of straw and branches, and dress the figure in old clothes. The woman represents a [[Slavic mythology|Slavic goddess]] of winter and is associated with death. Therefore her destruction symbolizes the beginning of new life in spring. After taking the figure  out of the village in a solemn procession, Morana is set on fire and then thrown into the water by singing girls.
* Shrovetide ([[Slavic carnival|Masopust]]): also serves to celebrate spring and ensure the fertility of future harvest. It includes a [[carnival]]-like procession of singing people dressed in masks of beasts and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuča|first=Pavel|title=Masopust - Fašank|language=Czech|url=http://czech.republic.cz/encyklopedie/objekty1.phtml?id=135067&amp;lng=1|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Easter]] celebrations: the most distinctive customs preserved in the Czech Republic are spanking women solemnly with a whip made of thin willow branches ([[pomlázka]]); or drenching them with cold water to symbolically guarantee their good health. In exchange, men often receive traditional food, [[Easter egg|decorated eggs]] and (recently), alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuncová|first=Romana|title=Celebrating Easter in the Czech Republic|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Celebrating-Easter-in-the-Czech-Republic|accessdate=19 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313082422/http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Celebrating-Easter-in-the-Czech-Republic|archivedate=13 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Burning of witches: also known as Walpurgis Night,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hubálková|first=Petra|title=Burning of Witches|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Burning-of-Witches|accessdate=19 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705143727/http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Burning-of-Witches|archivedate=5 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the traditional Czech stories, the night on the turn of April 30 and May 1 had a magical power. Not only was evil believed to be more powerful at this time, but also those who felt brave enough to go outside could find [[treasure]]s if they carried with them items such as wood fern flower, [[wafer]] or sanctified chalk. It was also believed that during the night [[witch]]es were flying and gathering for the [[Sabbath]]. To protect themselves, villagers burnt [[bonfire]]s on hills and set fire to brooms, which were then thrown into the air to reveal any flying witch. These celebrations are nowadays accompanied with music and traditional food and mark the opening of the tourist season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hollý|first=Ladislav|title=Pálení čarodějnic|language=Czech|url=http://czech.republic.cz/encyklopedie/objekty1.phtml?id=120943&amp;lng=1|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Erecting a Maypole: unmarried men in southern parts of the Czech Republic and in [[Slovácko|Slovacko]] cut off trees such as [[fir]], [[spruce]] or [[pine]] to make a traditional maypole out of it over night representing spring. The branches are cut off and only the top of the tree is left and decorated with ribbons and flowers. The [[maypole]] is then erected in the middle of the village. It is important to guard one’s maypole because men from other villages may try to cut it down as a form of contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hollý|first=Ladislav|title=Stavění MÁJE a májový čas|language=Czech|url=http://czech.republic.cz/encyklopedie/objekty1.phtml?id=120945&amp;lng=1|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional costumes==
[[File:Prague Pride 2013 - Moravian dress.jpg|thumb|upright|A participant of 2013 Prague Pride wearing a traditional Moravian costume ([[Haná|Hanakia]]) and a sign "Good day - [[Olomouc]] greets [[Prague]]"]]
Folklore is not merely about music. Czech folklore is characteristic for elaborate traditional costumes distinctive to each region or even village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Folk costumes|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Folk-costumes|accessdate=19 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131201061906/http://www.czech.cz/en/Discover-CZ/Lifestyle-in-the-Czech-Republic/Tradition/Folk-costumes|archivedate=1 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific aspects such as colors, [[embroidery]], themes and fragments of traditional costumes varied on the basis of social, geographical and symbolical factors as well as according to the purpose of their use. Costumes worn on special occasions were usually lavishly decorated, colorful and accompanied with a wide range of accessories (scarves, [[ribbon]]s, [[headdress]]es, hats, belts, etc.) while everyday clothes tended to be rather simple and practical. Every region had a set of amusing peculiarities. For example:

* Women in the [[Plzen Region|Plzen region]] wore up to 24 underskirts, which restricted their movement but were nevertheless a show of their fashionableness. 
* While married women in [[Haná|Hanakia]] wore plain clothes and hid their hair under bonnets and headdresses even from their own husbands, their men wore their hair long and even their clothes were flauntingly colorful and decorated.

Traditional costumes are no longer commonly worn in most parts of the Czech Republic. They may be used during traditional celebrations or festivals when worn by members of folklore ensembles. In some families, costumes are handed down from generation to generation as they wish to preserve the tradition. Likewise, many stay protected in museums and private collections.

==Folklore festivals==
Multiple folklore shows and festivals are organized in the Czech Republic throughout the year. They are a display of rich Czech traditions and folklore. At the festivals, various folklore groups demonstrate the heritage of their country. The performers are presented in traditional costumes particular to different regions of the Czech Republic. They perform [[folk dance]]s, traditional folk songs and play musical instruments. Many festivals are not only demonstrations of music and dances, but also show traditional [[Czech food|cuisine]] and crafts.

There are many folklore festivals in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Festivals|url=http://www.folklornisdruzeni.cz/en/festivals|work=Folklorní sdružení ČR|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://czech.republic.cz/encyklopedie/seznam.phtml?typ=44&amp;lng=2&amp;menu= |title=rezervační a informační systém |publisher=Czech.Republic.CZ |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vlčnov]]: probably the most famous one is a festival called “[[Ride of the Kings]]”. This festival takes place every year and can be also found on the list of UNESCO. 
* [[Strážnice]]: Another unique folklore festival. Not only does this festival present traditional Czech folklore, but also folklore groups from all over the world visit the town to show their own traditions. 
* [[Strakonice]]: The Bohemian city holds an annual bagpipe festival that attracts the locals, as well as foreign tourists. The festival is a parade and a meeting place of Czech and international bagpipe players.

==Folklore groups==
Czech Republic is abundant in folklore groups of all kinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://czech.republic.cz/encyklopedie/seznam.phtml?typ=38,245&amp;lng=2&amp;menu= |title=rezervační a informační systém |publisher=Czech.Republic.CZ |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal is to preserve local traditions and folklore and to pass the [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] on to the following generations. Members of the folklore groups are enthusiasts of all ages: from little children through adolescents to adults. They all enjoy building up folklore spirit with dances, music and showing off beautiful folklore dresses, as well as performing in front of audiences at folklore festivals. Children are encouraged to participate in folklore ensembles from a very early age.

==Traditional arts and crafts==
Traditional arts and crafts are an inseparable part of Czech folklore. 
* [[Corn husk doll|Cornhusk dolls]]: among the most popular traditional products. These dolls made of cornhusk and a few strings are nowadays used as decorations but in the past children used them as toys. Cornhusk dolls are also great [[souvenir]]s tourists can buy in the Czech Republic if they are looking for something truly traditional. 
* Pottery: Another popular traditional artistic product. Bohemian and Moravian [[pottery]] is painted with various folklore patterns, simple or floral ornaments. The pottery serves for both decorative and practical purposes.
* [[Bobbin lace]]: also one of the popular traditional items. The most famous Czech bobbin lace products are made in [[Vamberk]], a city in Eastern Bohemia. 
* The Czech Republic is also renowned for its production of [[glass]]: crystal glasses, bowls, vases, and other products contribute to the richness of heritage of the Czech Republic. 
* [[Indigo]] print products: hand-made textile goods. Tablecloths, toys, and other accessories are made of this material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13505">'''Dorota Alicja Nieznalska''' (born September 19, 1973) is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Visual arts|visual artist]] and [[Sculpture|sculptor]].

Nieznalska's controversial installation ''Pasja'' (2002), which included the placement of an image of the [[penis]] upon a metal [[Greek cross]], resulted in a notable scandal, as the display was condemned as immoral and [[blasphemous]] by Polish [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]]. The group exhibition at which the installation was presented was closed down by the authorities, while Nieznalska herself faced legal charges on account of an alleged violation of a provision of the Polish criminal code prohibiting blasphemy.

The sculptor was successful in fighting off the blasphemy conviction following the favorable ruling of an [[appeals court]] in 2009.

== Early life ==

Dorota Alicja Nieznalska was born to a devout family in [[Gdańsk]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="Baird 2005"&gt;Baird, Daniel (October 2005).

Retrieved 20 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Raised in the Gdańsk-[[Gdynia]]&amp;ndash;[[Sopot]] [[Tricity, Poland|Tricity]] area, Nieznalska was educated at an art high school in [[Gdynia Orłowo]].&lt;ref name = "WV: Arts and the Church"&gt;(24 July 2003).

==''Pasja'' (2002)==
[[Blasphemy]] charges were levelled against Nieznalska after an exhibition featuring the 2002 work ''Pasja'' (''"Passion"''), an artistic installation concerned with the themes of [[masculinity]] and [[suffering]].&lt;ref name = "Sinkiewicz December 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Feminist Revolt"&gt;Leskowicz, Pawel. [http://www.lilithgallery.com/feminist/Feminist_Revolt_Poland.html "Feminist Revolt: Censorship of Women’s Art in Poland".] The Lilith Gallery of Toronto. Retrieved 20 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "HF March 2010"/&gt; The installation was displayed at the experimental Gdańsk, [[Wyspa Gallery]], an institution associated with the academy, and consisted of two elements: a large [[Greek cross]] made of metal was suspended from the ceiling of the gallery, and covered; its center was filled in with an image of a man's [[hips]], [[thighs]], and [[penis]].&lt;ref name = "Art Liberated"&gt;[http://www.artliberated.org/?id=20&amp;p=cases Dorota Nieznalska. ''Pasja'' (''Passion'') , 2002.] Artliberated.org Retrieved 20 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the cross, the viewer's attention was drawn to a large video, its display projecting from an overhead angle the face and shoulders of a grimacing man in the act of [[Weight training|weight-lifting]].&lt;ref name = "Art Liberated"/&gt; The viewer's inability to behold the man's body, his other body parts being cut off from the screen, concocted an effect of ambiguity as to the activity of the man on the screen, suggesting that the man's feeling of torment could have been the effect of other kinds of activity.&lt;ref name = "Art Liberated"/&gt; The installation would be described by some as depicting "the penis of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]" in the ensuing controversy.&lt;ref name = "Baird 2005"/&gt;

==Legal charges of blasphemy==
Gdańsk activists of the [[right-wing]] [[League of Polish Families]] began a petition to the local authorities to open a legal case following the release of television footage of the exhibition.&lt;ref name = "Baird 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Jarecka Wyborcza 2009"&gt;Jarecka, Dorota (5 June 2009).[http://wyborcza.pl/1,75475,6689861,Nieznalska__katolicy__kulturysci.html "Nieznalska, katolicy, kulturyści".] ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]''.

[http://www.brooklynrail.org/2003/06/art/gender "Architectures of Gender: Contemporary Women’s Art in Poland".] ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]''. Retrieved 20 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Complaints about ''Pasja'' led to Nieznalska's being summoned to report to the local police on 2 March 2002. The city's [[Rightism|rightist]] municipal councilors quickly closed the exhibition while the young artist, insisting that her intention was to focus on "the cult of the male body", became the defendant of a trial concerning Nieznalska's alleged violation of the [[criminal code]].&lt;ref name = "WV: Arts and the Church"/&gt; Nieznalska's upcoming exhibits in [[Słupsk]] and [[Ostrów Wielkopolski]] were cancelled after further intervention from the League of Polish Families.&lt;ref name = "Baird 2005"/&gt; Members of the [[Polish nationalism|nationalist]] youth group ''[[Młodzież Wszechpolska]]'' threatened to "hang such artists" and "shave their heads, like the [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] did with women who were in close relationships with [the] [[Nazi Germany|Germans]]"&lt;ref name = "Raster 2003"&gt;Szylak, Aneta &amp; Grzegorz Klaman (20 July 2003). [http://www.raster.art.pl/english/artykuly/nieznalska.htm "The Case of Dorota Nieznalska".] ''Raster''. Retrieved 20 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the conclusion of the first legal process in 2003, the court found Nieznalska guilty of "offending religious feelings", a violation of the ban on [[blasphemy]] within Article 196 of the [[criminal code]].&lt;ref name = "Feminist Revolt"/&gt; Judge [[Tomasz Zieliński]] denied that Nieznalska's work was entitled to any special constitutional protection as an object of art, stating that "the fact that a work is within the boundaries of art has no significance for whether it can offend the feelings of other people."&lt;ref name = "Levine 66-67"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Caroline|title=Provoking Democracy: Why We Need the Arts|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2007|pages=66–67|isbn=1-4051-5926-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ordered Nieznalska to perform six months of unpaid [[community service]].&lt;ref name = "Levine 66-67"/&gt; The trial prosecutor had originally demanded a fine of 2000 ''[[złoty]]'', but the court decided to increase the penalty.&lt;ref name = "WV: Arts and the Church"/&gt; Judge Zieliński additionally forbade Nieznalska from traveling out of the country.&lt;ref name = "Levine 66-67"/&gt; The local deputies of the League of Polish Families present during the sentencing clapped to express their approval.&lt;ref name = "WV: Arts and the Church"/&gt;

Controversy surrounding Nieznalska's installation, already boiling during the initial trial, persisted well into the appeals process. An unsigned [[editorial]] in Poland's [[English language|Anglophone]] monthly ''[[The Warsaw Voice]]'', summing up the court case shortly after the initial verdict as a battle between the [[Leftism|left]] and [[Rightism|right]] - albeit "the first of its kind" for modern Poland - treated Nieznalska as "a tasteless provocateur, covering up her lack of genuine talent with shock tactics" and cited the opinion of [[Franciszek Starowieyski]], "one of the best-known Polish sculptors, himself rather partial to unconventional works", who "said before the beginning of the lawsuit that the one to blame was not the novice artist but the curator of the Gdańsk gallery. According to Starowieyski, Nieznalska's installation was of such a low artistic standard that it should never have been exhibited. Many other known artists, while not approving of the sentence, agreed that if not for the scandal, Nieznalska's work would have stood little chance of making it into reputable galleries."&lt;ref name = "WV: Arts and the Church"/&gt; The former [[President of Poland|president]] [[Lech Wałęsa]] spoke out against Nieznalska and supported a [[Hardline|hard line]], maintaining that the artist's sentence was insufficiently severe.&lt;ref name = "Baird 2005"/&gt; The fine arts professors supporting the Wyspa exhibitions decided to atone for the mistake by closing the gallery.&lt;ref name = "Raster 2003"/&gt;

The more [[Liberalism|liberal]] sections of Polish society stood up in support of the sculptor's right to free artistic expression.

Two former Wyspa staff - curator [[Aneta Szylak]] and director Grzegorz Klaman, Nieznalska's former instructor - wrote that while "[s]ince the times of [[Plato]], the academy [had been] a place for intellectual and artistic discourse", the principle "was broken when the gallery closed... Because she had the courage to show 'Pasja', Nieznalska had her scholarships and subsidies cut off; she has been stigmatized and censored...

The [[sarcophagus]] of '''Eshmunazar II''' ([[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]: ''{{transl|sem|ʾšmnʿzr}}''), a [[Phoenicia]]n king of [[Sidon]] and the son of King [[Tabnit]] (possibly the Greek [[Tenes]]), was created in the early 5th century BCE.  It was unearthed in 1855 at a site near [[Sidon]] and is now in the [[Louvre]]. The sarcophagus was likely created in Egypt, being carved from [[amphibolite]] from [[Wadi Hammamat]].

The inscription states that the "Lord of Kings" granted the Sidonian kings territory in Palestine: [[Tel Dor|Dor]], [[Jaffa]], the [[Plain of Sharon]].&lt;ref&gt;Louvre website: "The favor of the Persian king had increased the territory of Sidon by granting it part of Palestine: "The Lord of Kings gave us Dor and Yapho, the rich wheat-lands that are in the Plain of Sharon, in recognition of the great deeds that I accomplished and we have added to the lands that are forever those of the Sidonians.""&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription is the first discovered in the [[Phoenician language]] from the area known as [[Phoenicia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=:de:Reinhard G. Lehmann|first=Reinhard G.|last=Lehmann|title=Wilhelm Gesenius and the Rise of Phoenician Philology|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift für die alttestamentliche Wissenschaft|volume=427|location=Berlin / Boston|publisher=De Gruyter|date=2013|pages=209–266|url=http://www.hebraistik.uni-mainz.de/Dateien/Lehmann_Gesenius-Phoenix_2013.pdf}} Quote: "Alas, all these were either late or Punic, and came from Cyprus, from the ruins of Kition, from Malta, Sardinia, Athens, and Carthage, but not yet from the Phoenician homeland. The first Phoenician text as such was found as late as 1855, the Eshmunazor sarcophagus inscription from Sidon."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The sarcophagus was discovered in the Necropolis of Magharat Abloun ("Cavern of Apollo") on 20 February 1855 by Aimé Péretié, chancellor of the French consulate of Beirut. It was purchased in the same year by [[Honoré Théodoric d'Albert de Luynes]], who donated it to the [[Louvre]].&lt;ref name=Birch/&gt;

==Inscription==
[[File:Yafo-museum-4090.jpg|thumb|left|Copy of the inscription at the Jaffa museum]]
The sarcophagus bears a 22 line inscription, known as '''KAI-14''',&lt;ref name="KAI"&gt;"[[Kanaanäische und Aramäische Inschriften]]", Herbert Donner, Wolfgang Röllig , {{ISBN|3-447-04587-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; written in the [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite language]], in the [[Phoenician alphabet]].  The inscription identifies the king inside and warns people not to disturb his repose.&lt;ref name="abt"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Cline | first = Austin | title = Sidon Sarcophagus: Illustration of the Sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II Found Near Sidon, Lebanon | work = About.com | accessdate = 2009-03-27 | url = http://atheism.about.com/od/bibleplacescities/ig/Sidon-Lebanon-Phoenician-Photo/Sidon-Sarcophagus.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language used in the inscription is a [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite dialect]] mutually intelligible with [[Biblical Hebrew]].

As in other Phoenician inscriptions, the text seems to use no, or hardly any, ''[[matres lectionis]]''. As in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], the [[preposition]] אית ('''ʾyt''') is used as an [[accusative case|accusative]] marker, while את ('''ʾt''') is used for "with".&lt;ref name="KAI" /&gt;

== Translation ==
The translation below is based on that by [[Julius Oppert]],&lt;ref name=Birch&gt;''[[Samuel Birch]], [https://archive.org/stream/recordsofpastbei09sociiala#page/109/mode/1up Records of the past: Being English Translations of the Ancient Monuments of Egypt and Western Asia]'', vol. 9, 1877, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; amended with the help of a more recent translation in Prichard &amp; Fleming.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Prichard and Daniel E. Fleming, ''The Ancient Near East:  An Anthology of Texts and Pictures'', 2011, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

# In the month of [[Marcheshvan|Bul]],&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The eighth month of the Phoenician year which was identical with the Judaic.&lt;/ref&gt; in the fourteenth year of the royalty of King Eshmunazar,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;King Eshmunazar lived in the fourth century B.C., this is generally admitted on account of the form of the sarcophagus, which was certainly Egyptian; there are even in the middle of it traces of hieroglyphs which have been erased. The King Tabnit may be the Tennes of Greek authors.&lt;/ref&gt; King of the two Sidons,
# son of King [[Tabnit]], King of the two Sidons, King Eshmunazar, King of the two Sidons, said as follows: I am carried away,
# before my time, the son of (few) days, an orphan, the son of a widow. And I am lying in this coffin, and in this tomb,
# in the place which I have built. Whoever you are, of royal race or an ordinary man, may he not open this resting-place, and
# may he not search after anything, for nothing whatsoever has been placed into it. May he not move the coffin in which I am resting, nor carry
# me away from this resting-place to another resting-place. Whatever a man may tell thee, do not listen to him: For every royal race and
# every ordinary man, who will open this resting-place or who will carry away the coffin where I repose, or who will carry me
# away from this resting-place: may they not have any funeral couch with the embalmers (the Ropheïm), may they not be buried in a grave, and may there not be a son or offspring
# to succeed to them, and may the sacred gods abandon them to a mighty ruler who (might) rule them, in order
# to exterminate that royal race or man who will open this resting-place or who will take away
# this coffin, and also the offspring of this royal race, or of that ordinary man. There shall be to them no root below, nor
# fruit above, nor living form under the sun. For I am carried away, before my time, the son of
# (few) days, an orphan, the son of a widow. For I, Eshmunazar, King of the two Sidons, son of
# King Tabnit, King of the two Sidons, the grandson of King Eshmunazar, King of the two Sidons, And my mother Amoashtart,
# the Priestess of Astarte, our mistress, the Queen, the daughter of King Eshmunazar, King of the two Sidons: It is we who have built the temple of
# the gods, and the temple of Astaroth, on the seaside Sidon,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The seaside Sidon' Sidon eres yam, seems to be one of the two Sidons, the other may have been the Sidon of the mountain. Sennacherib speaks also of the two Sidons, the great and the little one&lt;/ref&gt; and have placed there (the image of) Astaroth in Shamem-Addirim. And it is we
# who have built a [[Temple of Eshmun|temple for Eshmun]], the holy prince, at the purpleshells River on the mountain, and have established him in Shamem-Addirim. And it is we who have built the temples
# for the gods of the two Sidons, in the seaside Sidon, tile temple of Baal-Sidon and the temple of Ashtart-Shem-Baal. Moreover, the Lord of Kings&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The "Lords of the Kings" seem not to be the Kings of Persia, but an epithet applicable to a divine king.&lt;/ref&gt; gave us
# [[Tel Dor|Dor]] and [[Jaffa|Joppa]], the mighty lands of [[Dagon]], which are in tile plain of [[Sharon|Saron]], in accordance with the important deeds which I did. And we annexed them
# to the boundary of the land, that they would belong to the two Sidons for ever. Whoever you are, of royal race or ordinary man, may he not open it
# and may he not uncover me and may he not carry me away from this resting-place. Otherwise,
# the sacred gods shall abandon them and exterminate this royal race and this ordinary man and their offspring for ever.

Line # 16 "wyšrn" = "to set" or "to place" and Line # 17 "wyšbny" = "to establish" use the same root but were spelled by the engraver (the Scribe)differently. Line # 16 used "R" and Line # 17 used "B". In the Phoenician script they are similar and there could be a mistake here by the Scribe or by the person making the drawing of the inscription in the 19th Century. The correct usage is "wyšbn" and Line # 16 is the error,&lt;ref&gt;pages 42 "Ifil" and 107 "wyšbn", see Glossary of Phoenician, by Harris, Zellig S.,: A Grammar of the Phoenician Language, New Haven, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eugène Verboeckhoven Selbstporträt 1854.jpg|thumb|200px|Self-portrait (1854)]]
'''Eugène Joseph Verboeckhoven''' (9 June 1798&amp;nbsp;– 19 January 1881), a [[Belgium|Belgian]] painter, was born at [[Warneton, Belgium|Warneton]] in [[West Flanders]]. He was a painter, a sculptor, an etcher, an engraver, and a lithographer of animals, animated landscapes, and portraits.

==Biography==
Eugène Verboeckhoven studied under his father, Barthélemy Verboeckhoven, a sculptor. In 1816 he worked under Voituron in [[Ghent]]. In the first half of the 19th century, the salons were a home for burgeoning art. Verboeckhoven was a regular participant at the Ghent (1820 and 1824) and Brussels Salons (1827–1860). He visited the Ardennes, France, Great Britain (1826), Germany (1828) and Italy (1841). He was held in high repute and elaborated on the works of artists such as [[Jean-Baptiste De Jonghe|De Jonghe]], [[Pieter-Frans De Noter|De Noter]], [[Johannes Hermanus Koekkoek|Koekkoek]], [[Jean Augustin Daiwaille|Daiwaille]], Kheelhof, Verheyden, and his pupils Louis-Pierre Verwee and the [[Charles-Philogène Tschaggeny|Tschaggeny]] brothers. He was a member of the academies of Brussels, Ghent, [[Antwerp]], [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Amsterdam]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Verboeckhoven was an excellent painter of animals and, together with his pupils, appears to have been the last link to a secular tradition with its roots deep in the 17th century, which linked observation of nature, studied composition, and idealized reproduction of reality. Like the Old Masters, he obtained the colour blue for his skies by grinding down [[lapis lazuli]]. He was a prolific artist and very meticulous in his preparation: hundreds of sketches and studies were produced on the spot, assembling different elements like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Such was his dexterity that many artists called upon him to enrich their works with some of his animals and figures. Between 1841 and 1842, he visited Italy, Switzerland, and Scotland. His inspiration remained the same and his technique unaltered, but his notebooks were now filled with sketches of different landscapes.
[[File:Eugène Verboeckhoven - Still-Life with a Hare - WGA24563.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Still-life with Hare (1844)]]
The beauty that emanates from his paintings occasionally hides Verboeckhoven's fundamental talent for drawing. Attention should first be drawn to his preparatory works: his sketches, lithographs, and engravings. His portraits, historical subjects, and sculptures also merit attention.

===Other activities===
A man of his time, he played an important role in the Belgian Revolution of 1830 and was appointed Director General of the Brussels Museums of Fine Arts by the temporary government. Until the end of his life, he was a member of the Committee of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts and when King Leopold I created the category of Fine Arts at the Academy in 1848, he was on the advisory board. Verboeckhoven was also involved in local politics. From 1861 to 1867, he was the Deputy Mayor for the Schaerbeek Council, Brussels.

Like many of his colleagues, Verboeckhoven was a freemason. He joined the Brussels Lodge in 1834 with his brother [[Charles-Louis Verboeckhoven|Charles-Louis]], a well-known [[marine painter]], and his initiation took place on 25 February 1834. Shortly after joining, he suggested founding a Freemason museum. He was very attached to his philosophical convictions and from 1834 onwards and systematically after 1850 added the triangle of three Masonic points to his signature. Eugène Verboeckhoven died in Schaerbeek, Brussels, in 1881. His works are held in museums worldwide.

'''''Festivals''''' is a 1973 anthology of [[festival]]-related [[folklore]] from around the world that have been compiled by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]]. According to the book's [[dust jacket]], "This potpourri of festivals reveals fascinating customs and celebrations from many countries of the world. Each special day is preceded by background material on the origins of the holiday."

Some of the special days covered are (using Manning-Sanders' words and spellings): [[New Year's Day]], [[Brigid of Kildare|Saint Bride's Day]], the [[Sapporo Snow Festival|Japanese Snow Festival]], [[Valentine's Day|Saint Valentine's Day]], [[Saint Patrick's Day]], [[Shrove Tuesday]], [[Mardi Gras]], [[Easter|Easter Day]], [[April Fools' Day|All Fools' Day]], the [[Qingming Festival|Bright Weather Festival]], [[St George's Day|Saint George's Day]], [[May Day]], the [['Obby 'Oss festival|Padstow Hobby Horse]], [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], [[Michaelmas|Michaelmas Day]], [[Saint Crispin's Day]], [[Halloween|Hallow E'en]], the [[Guy Fawkes Night|Fifth of November]], [[Hogmanay]], and [[Christmas]].

For many of the festivals, the book includes the writings of some famous authors or historical personalities. Among those included in the book are [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]], [[William Sharp (writer)|Fiona Macleod]], [[Marco Polo]], [[John Donne]], [[Charles James Lyall|Sir Charles Lyall]], [[Norman Hunter (author)|Norman Hunter]], [[Chiang Yee]], [[Flora Thompson]], [[Laurie Lee]], [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Richard Cobbold]], [[P. L. Travers]], [[Oliver Herford]], [[Alison Uttley]], [[Richard Crashaw]], Jon and [[Rumer Godden]], and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]].

Editor Manning-Sanders, a [[poet]] and [[author]] who was perhaps best known for her series of [[children's books]] in which she collected and retold [[fairy tales]], contributes four pieces to this book:

* ''Not 'Zactly''
* ''The Padstow Hobby Horse''
* ''The Ghost Ship'' (an excerpt from her novel ''Mystery at Penmarth'')
* ''The Christmas Crab Apples''

The '''First Cyprus Treasure''' or ''Lamboussa Treasure'' is the name of a major early [[Byzantine]] silver hoard found near [[Kyrenia]], Cyprus. Currently in the [[British Museum]]'s collection,  the treasure is largely composed of liturgical objects that may have belonged to an ancient church or monastery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=31027&amp;plaA=31027-3-2 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; It is called the ''First Cyprus Treasure'' to distinguish it from the so-called ''Second Cyprus Treasure'', which is now split between the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and the [[Cyprus Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/464377 Metropolitan Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
The hoard was found by accident at the end of the nineteenth century near the [[Acheiropoietos Monastery]], west of [[Kyrenia]] at the ancient site of [[Lambousa]]. It is unclear why the treasure was deposited, but it may have been deliberately hidden to evade the [[Muslim conquests|invading Arab armies]] of 653 AD. Following its discovery, the entire treasure came into the possession of the French aristocrat Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, [[House of Talleyrand-Périgord|Duc de Dino]], who in turn sold it to the [[British Museum]] in 1899.

==Description of the treasure==
The treasure was probably made in [[Constantinople]], the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and is composed of 28 different objects, all made of silver. It includes a bowl with a half length image of a saint (possibly Saint [[Sergius and Bacchus|Sergius]]), a paten with cross in the centre, a hexagonal censer and twenty-five pear-shaped spoons, eleven of which are engraved with leaping animals. The bowl is marked with five stamps from the reign of emperor [[Constans II]], who reigned between 641-51 AD.

The term '''''formalism''''' describes an emphasis on form over content or meaning in the [[arts]], [[literature]], or [[philosophy]]. A practitioner of formalism is called a '''''formalist'''''.  A formalist, with respect to some discipline, holds that there is no transcendent meaning to that discipline other than the literal content created by a practitioner.  For example, formalists within [[mathematics]] claim that mathematics is no more than the symbols written down by the mathematician, which is based on logic and a few elementary rules alone.  This is as opposed to non-formalists, within that field, who hold that there are some things inherently true, and are not, necessarily, dependent on the symbols within mathematics so much as a greater truth.  Formalists within a discipline are completely concerned with "the rules of the game," as there is no other external truth that can be achieved beyond those given rules.  In this sense, formalism lends itself well to disciplines based upon [[axiomatic system]]s.

==Religion==
Formalism in religion means an emphasis on [[ritual]] and [[religious observance|observance]] over their meanings.  Within Christianity, the term [[Legalism (theology)|legalism]] is a derogatory term that is loosely synonymous to religious formalism.

==Law==
{{Main|Legal formalism}}
Formalism is a school of thought in law and [[jurisprudence]] which assumes that the law is a system of rules that can determine the outcome of any case, without reference to external norms.  For example, formalism animates the commonly heard criticism that "judges should apply the law, not make it."  To formalism's rival, legal realism, this criticism is incoherent, because legal realism assumes that, at least in difficult cases, all applications of the law will require that a judge refer to external (i.e. non-legal) sources, such as the judge's conception of justice, or commercial norms.

==Criticism==
In general in the study of the arts and literature, ''formalism'' refers to the style of criticism that focuses on artistic or literary techniques in themselves, in separation from the work's social and historical context. 

===Art criticism===
{{Main|formalism (art)}}

Generally speaking, formalism is the concept which everything necessary in a work of art is contained within it.  The context for the work, including the reason for its creation, the historical background, and the life of the artist, is not considered to be significant.  Examples of formalist aestheticians are [[Clive Bell]], [[Jerome Stolnitz]], and [[Edward Bullough]].

===Literary criticism===
{{Main|formalism (literature)}}

In contemporary discussions of [[literary theory]], the school of criticism of [[I. A. Richards]] and his followers, traditionally the [[New Criticism]],  has sometimes been labelled 'formalist'. The formalist approach, in this sense, is a continuation of aspects of classical [[rhetoric]]. 

[[Russian formalism]] was a twentieth century school, based in Eastern Europe, with roots in linguistic studies and also theorising on [[fairy tale]]s, in which content is taken as secondary since the tale 'is' the form, the princess 'is' the fairy-tale princess.

==The arts&lt;!--Linked from 'Theory of art'--&gt;==
===Poetry===
In modern poetry, ''Formalist poets'' may be considered as the opposite of writers of [[free verse]]. These are only labels, and rarely sum up matters satisfactorily. 'Formalism' in poetry represents an attachment to poetry that recognises and uses schemes of rhyme and rhythm to create poetic effects and to innovate. To distinguish it from archaic poetry the term 'neo-formalist' is sometimes used.

See for example:
*''[[The Formalist]]'', a literary magazine (now defunct) for formalist poetry
*[[New Formalism]], a movement within the [[poetry of the United States]].

===Film===
{{Main| Formalist film theory}}
In [[film studies]], formalism is a trait in filmmaking, which overtly uses the language of film, such as [[editing]], shot [[composition (visual arts)|composition]], camera movement, set design, etc., so as to emphasise [[graphical]] (as opposed to [[diegetic]]) qualities of the image.  Strict formalism, condemned by [[Realism (arts)|realist]] film theorists such as [[André Bazin]], has declined substantially in popular usage since the 1950s, though some more postmodern filmmakers reference it to suggest the artificiality of the film experience. 

Examples of formalist films may include Resnais's ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]'' and [[Sergei Parajanov|Parajanov]]'s ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Intellectual method==
Formalism can be applied to a set of notations and rules for manipulating them which yield results in agreement with experiment or other techniques of calculation.  These rules and notations may or may not have a corresponding mathematical semantics. In the case no mathematical semantics exists, the calculations are often said to be ''purely formal''. See for example [[scientific formalism]].

==Mathematics==
{{Main|Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)}}

In the [[foundations of mathematics]], formalism is associated with a certain rigorous mathematical method: see [[formal system]]. In common usage, ''a'' formalism means the out-turn of the effort towards formalisation of a given limited area. In other words, matters can be formally discussed once captured in a formal system, or commonly enough within something ''formalisable'' with claims to be one. Complete formalisation is in the domain of [[computer science]].

Formalism also more precisely refers to a certain school in the [[philosophy of mathematics]], stressing [[axiom]]atic proofs through [[theorem]]s, specifically associated with [[David Hilbert]]. In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], therefore, a formalist is a person who belongs to the school of formalism, which is a certain mathematical-philosophical doctrine descending from Hilbert.

==Anthropology==
In [[economic anthropology]], formalism is the theoretical perspective that the principles of [[neoclassical economics]] can be applied to our understanding of all human societies.

The '''handscroll''' is a long, narrow, horizontal [[scroll]] format in East Asia used for calligraphy or paintings.

==History==
The handscroll format originated with ancient Chinese text documents.&lt;ref name=npm&gt;[http://www.npm.gov.tw/english/exhbition/ehan0101/ehan0101.htm "Famous Handscroll Paintings and Calligraphic Works"] {{en icon}} or [http://www.npm.gov.tw/exhbition/chan0101/chan0101.htm "手卷名品展"] {{Zh icon}}.  Taipei: National Palace Museum. Retrieved 24 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (770-481 BCE) through the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE - 220 CE), [[Bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo or wooden slips]] were bound together and used to write texts on.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; During the Eastern Han period (25-220), the use of [[paper]] and [[silk]] in the handscroll format became more common.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; The handscroll was the one of the main formats for texts up until the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907).&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; Since the [[Three Kingdoms]] (220–280), the handscroll became a standard format for paintings.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; New styles were developed over time.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt;

==Description==
A handscroll has a backing of protective and decorative silk (包首) usually bearing a small title label (題籤) on it.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; In Chinese art, the handscroll usually consists of a frontispiece (引首) at the beginning (right side), the artwork (畫心) itself in the middle, and a colophon section (拖尾) at the end for various inscriptions.&lt;ref name=delbanco/&gt;&lt;ref name=npm/&gt;&lt;ref name=artchicago&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese Scrolls|url=http://www.artic.edu/taoism/diag-scrolls.php|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the scroll, where the frontispiece was located, is known as the "heaven" (天頭).&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; Vertical strips (隔水) are sometimes used to separate the different sections.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; Most handscrolls contain only one painting, although several short paintings can also be mounted on the scroll.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; At the beginning of the scroll is a wooden stave (天杆), which serves as a support.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; A silk cord (帶子) and a fastener (別子) is attached to the stave and used to secure the rolled-up scroll.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt; A wooden roller (木杆) is attached at the very end, around which the scroll is rolled.&lt;ref name=npm/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1418">The '''Idol of Pomos''', is a [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[sculpture]] from the [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] [[village]] of [[Pomos]]. 
It dates back to the [[Copper Age|Chalcolithic]] period, circa the [[30th century BC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premierdmc.com.cy/IdolPomos.htm premierdmc.com.cy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture is on display in the [[Cyprus Museum|Cyprus Archeological Museum]] in [[Lefkosia]] (Nicosia).

==Symbolism==
The sculpture represents a [[woman]] with her arms spread and was probably used as a [[fertility]] symbol. Many similar sculptures have been found on Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cafe.naver.com/ArticleRead.nhn?clubid=15688620&amp;menuid=76&amp;boardtype=P&amp;page=1&amp;specialmenutype=&amp;articleid=1373 cafe.naver.com], contains a Picture from Nicosia Museum {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller versions were worn as [[amulet]]s around the neck, just as this idol wears (a small copy of) itself.

==Euro==
In 2008 Cyprus adopted the [[Euro]]. The Idol, a representation of Cypriot prehistoric [[art]], was chosen to be displayed on the [[Cypriot euro coins]] of [[1 euro|1]] and 2 euro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbbmuseum.be/de/2008/02/cyprus-and-malta.htm?lang=en nbbmuseum.be]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Scott Dance''', formerly the '''Irish Modern Dance Theatre''', is a [[Dublin]] based [[modern dance]] company. It was founded by '''John Scott''' in 1991&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishplayography.com/search/company.aspx?la=en&amp;companyID=43 Irish Playography Member Page]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of creating, commissioning and expanding dance experience in Ireland.

==Background==
The Irish Modern Dance Theatre (IMDT) was founded in 1991 by Dublin born choreographer John Scott.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danceireland.ie/members/member.php?id=200&amp;PHPSESSID=bb8a1d012378c9320da24e9328870438 Dance Ireland Member John Scott] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721123240/http://www.danceireland.ie/members/member.php?id=200&amp;PHPSESSID=bb8a1d012378c9320da24e9328870438 |date=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 the company launched its first production, a piece called ''Beneath the Storm''.

Many IMDT works have premiered in Dublin's [[Project Arts Centre]], including ''Next to Skin''. ''Next to Skin'' was described as an attempt to take dancers of different backgrounds and languages including Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], French, German and Kabaye, and produce a "stream of consciousness, describing what the other dancers are doing,".&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Foley,[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2008/0119/1200605137440.html Straying Far From The Hearth], Irish Times, 19/01/08&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 90's IMDT had a number of shows that featured in the [[Dublin Theatre Festival]] such as ''Dance for Another Place'' in 1994, followed by ''Ruby Red'' in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dublintheatrefestival.com/programme/display.asp?EventID=358 Dublin Theatre Festival Programme Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Dance for the Bees'' in 1997. In the 2000s IMDT's continue to feature in festivals all over Ireland, making appearances in the '''International Dance Festival of Ireland''' in 2003 with ''Last Supper'' and 2006 with ''Close-Ups'', and the '''Eigse Carlow Arts Festival''' in 2007 with ''Rhythmic Space'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2010/0303/1224265484845.html Carlow's New Ty Vision], Irish Times, 3/3/10&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''[[Kilkenny Arts Festival]]''' that same year with ''This Dancing Life''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2007/0810/breaking42.html Kilkenny Festival Goes Cosmopolitan], Irish Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parsons [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2007/0810/1186425040399.html Power Set To Be Talk of the Town], Irish Times, 10/08/07&lt;/ref&gt;

''This Dancing Life'' had a performance time of 4 hours, the aim being to have audience members leave the performance and come back later, with one reviewer saying "I've never walked out of a performance that I liked, but Sara Rudner's This Dancing Life is as much about not being there as being there. She doesn't really want audiences to sit through the four hours of dance".&lt;ref&gt;MIchael Seaver [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2007/0822/1187332287312.html], Irish Times, 22/08/07&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the company's name was changed to "John Scott Dance".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.johnscottdance.com/about "About"] John Scott Dance website&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Touring==
As well touring nationwide across Ireland IMDT is also extremely active in taking its work to international audiences with some notable appearances including ''The Ramallah Dance Festival'' in Palestine where the company performed its production of ''The White Piece'', and '''Tanzmesse NRW, Düsseldorf, Germany'''. IMDT has also visited [[Sweden]], France, [[Brazil]], and [[Estonia]].

==Films==
IMDT has worked extensively with Steve Woods, a film-maker based in the National Film School [Dún Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology].

[[File:John tavener 2005.JPG|thumb|Sir John Tavener in 2005]]
'''Sir John Kenneth Tavener''' (28 January 1944 – 12 November 2013) was an English composer, known for his extensive output of religious works, including ''[[The Protecting Veil]]'', ''[[Song for Athene]]'' and ''[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]''.

Tavener first came to prominence with his cantata ''[[The Whale (Tavener)|The Whale]]'', premiered in 1968. Then aged 24, he was described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "the musical discovery of the year",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Meirion Bowen|title=Two Tavener Works at the Queen Elizabeth Hall |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/12/john-tavener-guardian-review|work=[[The Guardian]]| origyear=13 June 1968 |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The Times]]'' said he was "among the very best creative talents of his generation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockian.biz/linn/ckd378.htm Linn Records: "Carmina Celtica: Canty"]&lt;/ref&gt; During his career he became one of the best known and popular composers of his generation, most particularly for ''The Protecting Veil'', which as recorded by cellist [[Steven Isserlis]] became a bestselling album, and ''Song for Athene'' which was sung at the [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|funeral of Princess Diana]].&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; ''The Lamb'' featured in the soundtrack for [[Paolo Sorrentino]]'s film ''[[The Great Beauty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janusfilms.com/thegreatbeauty/ |title=Janus Films presents The Great Beauty (La Grande Bellezza) |publisher=Janusfilms.com |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavener was [[British honours system|knight]]ed in 2000 for his services to music and won an [[Ivor Novello Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/gadgets_and_gaming/article6991720.ece|title=Not just a blip: Ivor Novello awards to recognise computer game music |author=Adam Sherwin|date=18 January 2010|work=The Times|accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Tavener was born on 28 January 1944 in [[Wembley]], London.&lt;ref&gt;David Mason. ''Greene's biographical encyclopedia of composers''. Doubleday, 1995. 31. {{ISBN|0-385-14278-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents ran a family building firm&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; and his father was also an organist at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church in [[Frognal]], [[Hampstead]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Ivan Moody. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/27569 "Tavener, John"], Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 13 November 2013 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 12, Tavener was taken to [[Glyndebourne]] to hear Mozart's ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', a work he loved for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; That same year he heard Stravinsky’s most recent work, ''[[Canticum Sacrum]]'', which he later described as "the piece that woke me up and made me want to be a composer".&lt;ref name=telegraphobit&gt;{{cite news|title=Music Obituary: Sir John Tavener |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/10444987/Sir-John-Tavener-obituary.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tavener became a music scholar at [[Highgate School]] (where a fellow pupil was [[John Rutter]]).&lt;ref name=White2013p29/&gt; The school choir was often employed by the BBC in works requiring boys' voices, so Tavener gained choral experience singing in Mahler's [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]] and Orff's ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]''.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; He started to compose at Highgate, and also became a sufficiently proficient pianist to perform the second and third movements of Beethoven's [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]] and, in 1961 with the [[National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain|National Youth Orchestra]], Shostakovich's [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Shostakovich)|Piano Concerto No. 2]].&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; He also became organist and choirmaster in 1961 at St John's Presbyterian Church, Kensington (now St Mark's [[Coptic Orthodox]] Church),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stmark.org.uk/history/pre-1975-st-johns-presbyterian-church |title=Our History (Pre-1975) |publisher=Stmark.org.uk |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; a post he held for 14 years.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt;&lt;!-- the St Mark's website says "appointed in 1952" which is obviously wrong, as he was only 8 years old then --&gt;

Tavener entered the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in 1962, where his tutors included Sir [[Lennox Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=Guardianobit&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael J Stewart|title=Sir John Tavener obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/12/john-tavener|work=The Guardian| date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; During his studies there he decided to give up the piano and devote himself to composition.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt;

==''The Whale'' and early career==
Tavener first came to prominence in 1968 with his dramatic cantata ''The Whale'', based on the Old Testament story of [[Book of Jonah|Jonah]].&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; It was premièred at the [[London Sinfonietta]]'s début concert,&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; which was also the opening concert of the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael White, "A Time for Reflection", ''[[BBC Music Magazine]]'', Vol. 22 No. 2 (December 2013), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Tavener's younger brother, Roger, was then doing some building work on [[Ringo Starr]]'s home and, gaining the musician's interest, persuaded [[the Beatles]] to have ''The Whale'' recorded by [[Apple Records]] and released in 1970.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; The following year Tavener began teaching at [[Trinity College of Music]], London.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Other works by Tavener released by Apple included his ''[[A Celtic Requiem]]'', which impressed [[Benjamin Britten]] enough to persuade [[Covent Garden]] to commission an opera from Tavener:&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; the ultimate result, to a libretto by playwright [[Gerard McLarnon]], was ''Thérèse''. When staged in 1979 the opera was thought too static to be a successful drama.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;

Tavener had also been deeply affected by his brief 1974 marriage to the Greek dancer Victoria Maragopoulou.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; His chamber opera ''A Gentle Spirit'' (1977), with a libretto by McLarnon based on a story by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], concerns a pawnbroker whose marriage fails to the extent that his wife commits suicide. It has been deemed "far superior to ''Thérèse'', with the internal drama more suited to the stage".&lt;ref name= Guardianobit/&gt; Significantly, it also touched on [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]], to which McLarnon had been a convert for several years.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;

==Conversion to Orthodox Christianity==
Tavener converted to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1977.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2015}}&lt;!--Ivan Moody's NG article does not specify whether the Orthodox Church to which Tavener converted was Russian, Greek, or some other variety.--&gt; Orthodox theology and liturgical traditions became a major influence on his work. He was particularly drawn to its [[mysticism]], studying and setting to music the writings of [[Church Fathers]] and completing a setting of the [[Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom]], the principal eucharistic liturgy of the Orthodox Church: this was Tavener's first directly Orthodox-inspired music.&lt;ref name=nprobit&gt;{{cite news|author=Anastasia Tsioulcas|title=Remembering 'Holy Minimalist' Composer John Tavener |url= https://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2013/11/12/244788638/remembering-holy-minimalist-composer-john-tavener|work=[[NPR Music]]| date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
[[File:William Blake - Songs of Innocence and Experience - The Lamb.jpg|thumb|200px| John Tavener's choral arrangement of [[William Blake]]'s "[[The Lamb]]" from his collection ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'' is a continually popular work. This image represents copy C, object 8 of that original poem, currently held by the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=songsie.c.illbk.09&amp;java=no| title = Songs of Innocence and of Experience, copy C, object 9 (Bentley 8, Erdman 8, Keynes 8) "The Lamb"| publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]| editors = Morris Eaves, Robert N. Essick, and Joseph Viscomi| accessdate = 26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Tavener's subsequent explorations of Russian and Greek culture resulted in ''Akhmatova Requiem'': this failed to enjoy success either at its Edinburgh Festival premiere in 1981, or at its [[The Proms|Proms]]' performance the following week where many of the audience left before it finished.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; Of more lasting success was Tavener's short unaccompanied four-part choral setting of [[William Blake]]'s poem "[[The Lamb]]", written one afternoon in 1982 for his nephew Simon's third birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/11167 |title=John Tavener - The Lamb (1982) |publisher=Music Sales Classical |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This simple [[homophonic]] piece is usually performed as a [[Christmas carol]]. Later prominent works include ''The Akathist of Thanksgiving'' of 1987, written in celebration of the millennium of the Russian Orthodox Church; ''The Protecting Veil'', first performed by cellist Steven Isserlis and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at the 1989 Proms; and ''Song for Athene'' (1993). The two choral works were settings of texts by [[Mother Thekla]], a Russian Orthodox abbess who was Tavener's long-time spiritual adviser until her death in 2011.&lt;ref name=nprobit/&gt; ''Song for Athene'' in particular gained worldwide exposure when performed at the [[funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;

Tavener's ''Fall and Resurrection'', first performed in 2000, used instruments such as [[Shofar|ram's horn]], [[Ney|ney flute]] and [[kaval]]. It was dedicated to the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], with whom Tavener formed a lasting friendship.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; In 2003 Tavener composed the exceptionally large work ''[[The Veil of the Temple]]'' (which was premièred at the [[Temple Church]], London), based on texts from a number of religions. Identified by Tavener as "the supreme achievement of my life",&lt;ref name=nprobit/&gt; it is set for four choirs, several orchestras and soloists and lasts at least seven hours.&lt;ref name=White2013p29/&gt; ''Prayer of the Heart'', written for and performed by [[Björk]], was premiered in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=John Tavener, composer and seeker, dies at 69 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/11/12/john-tavener-composer-and-seeker-dies-at-69/3508339/|work=[[USA Today]]| date=12 November 2013 |accessdate= 14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Tavener composed ''The Beautiful Names'', a setting of the 99 names of God in the Muslim tradition, sung in [[Arabic]].&lt;ref name=nprobit/&gt;

It had been reported, particularly in the British press, that Tavener left [[Orthodox Christianity]] to explore a number of other different religious traditions, including [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]], and became a follower of the [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalist]] philosopher [[Frithjof Schuon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Morrison|title=99 Names for God: John Tavener Turns his Back on Orthodoxy|publisher=BBC Music|date=November 2004}}: p. 30.  Tavener is quoted as saying, "It strikes me now that all religions are as senile as one another."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David McCleery |title=The Beautiful Names: John Tavener|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras/symphonyorchestra/performances/Tavener_biog.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', conducted by British music journalist Michael White, Tavener said: "I reached a point where everything I wrote was terribly austere and hidebound by the tonal system of the Orthodox Church, and I felt the need, in my music at least, to become more universalist: to take in other colors, other languages." The interviewer also reported at the time that he "hasn’t abandoned Orthodoxy. He remains devotedly Christian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/arts/music/17whit.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;ref=music&amp;pagewanted=print&amp; |title=Christian Composer, Inspired by Allah's 99 Names |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the [[BBC Four]] television programme ''Sacred Music'' in 2010, Tavener described himself as "essentially Orthodox".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rs3w2 ''Sacred Music''], series 2, episode 4, broadcast in the UK on [[BBC Four]] on 2 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He reiterated both his desire to explore the musical traditions of other religions, and his adherence to the Orthodox Christian faith, on ''[[Start the Week]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006r9xr |title=BBC Radio 4 - Start the Week |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded only days before his death and broadcast on 11&amp;nbsp;November 2013.

==Death==
Tavener died, aged 69, on 12 November 2013 at his home in [[Child Okeford]], Dorset.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[[BBC News]] (12 November 2013).

Tavener's funeral was held at the Anglican Cathedral in Winchester on 28 November 2013.  The service was Orthodox, and presided over by Archbishop Gregorios of Thyateira, the representative of the Ecumenical Patriarch, and the most senior Orthodox bishop currently in the UK.  Some 700 mourners attended.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-25138013 "Sir John Tavener: Hundreds attend composer's funeral"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[John Rutter]] describes Tavener as having the "very rare gift" of being able to "bring an audience to a deep silence."&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; According to Steven Isserlis, "he had his own voice. He wasn't writing to be popular – he was writing the music he had to write."&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

===Style and development===
While Tavener's earliest music was influenced by [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]] – often invoking the sound world of Stravinsky, in particular ''Canticum Sacrum'',&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; and the ecstatic quality found in various works by Messiaen – his later music became more sparse, using wide [[Register (music)|registral space]] and was usually [[diatonic]]ally [[Tonality|tonal]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Tavener recognised [[Arvo Pärt]] as "a kindred spirit" and shared with him a common religious tradition and a fondness for textural transparency.&lt;ref name=White2013p29&gt;Michael White, "A Time for Reflection", [[BBC Music Magazine]], Vol. 22 No. 2 (December 2013): p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joni Eareckson Tada''' (born October 15, 1949) is an [[evangelical Christian]] author,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/2013/06/07/october-26-2012-joni-eareckson-tada-breast-cancer-update/13587/|title=Joni Eareckson Tada: Breast Cancer Update|work=Religion &amp; Ethics NewsWeekly - PBS|accessdate=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; radio host, and founder of ''Joni and Friends'', an organization "accelerating Christian ministry in the disability community."

==Early life==
Tada was born in 1949 in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], the youngest of four daughters. Her parents were named John and Lindy Eareckson.&lt;ref name="HistorysWomen"&gt;{{cite web |title=Joni Eareckson Tada |url=https://historyswomen.com/history-in-the-making/joni-eareckson-tada/ |website="historyswomen.com" |publisher=A Minute with History's Women |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joni was named for her father, John Eareckson, so her name is pronounced like "Johnny".&lt;ref name="HistorysWomen" /&gt;

Her father participated in the 1932 Olympics as an alternate for the United States wrestling team and was honored as a Distinguished Member of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wrestling Hall of Fame {{!}} Johnny Eareckson |url=https://nwhof.org/stillwater/hall-of-fame/#type=hof&amp;honoree=102 |website=''nwhof.org'' |publisher=National Wrestling Hall of Fame |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joniandfriends.org/radio/4-minute/dad-my-hero/|title=Joni and Friends Radio|website=|access-date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the example of her parents, Tada lived a very active life all through her growing up years. She enjoyed riding horses, hiking, tennis, and swimming. On July 30, 1967, she dove into the [[Chesapeake Bay]] after misjudging the shallowness of the water. She suffered a fracture between the fourth and fifth cervical levels and became a [[quadriplegic]] (or [[Tetraplegia|tetraplegic]]), paralyzed from the shoulders down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.joniandfriends.org/radio/5-minute/jonis-diving-accident45-years/ |title=Joni Eareckson Tada Commemorates 45 Years of Quadriplegia &amp;#124; Radio |publisher=Joni and Friends |date=July 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Tada's two years of rehabilitation, according to her autobiography ''Joni'', she experienced anger, depression, suicidal thoughts, and religious doubts. However, during occupational therapy, learned to paint with a brush between her teeth and began selling her artwork. She also writes this way, although for most writing tasks she relies on voice recognition software. To date, she has written over forty books, recorded several musical albums, starred in an autobiographical movie of her life, and is an advocate for people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Victory Through Suffering |url=http://powertochange.com/changed/jeareckson/ |publisher=Power to Change |accessdate=November 30, 2018 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090110172239/http://powertochange.com/changed/jeareckson/ |archivedate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tada wrote of her experiences in her 1976 international best-selling autobiography, ''Joni: The unforgettable story of a young woman's struggle against quadriplegia &amp; depression'', which has been distributed in many languages. The book was made into a 1979 feature film of the same name, starring herself. Her second book, ''A Step Further'', was released in 1978.&lt;ref name="RightNow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Joni Eareckson Tada |url=https://www.rightnowmedia.org/Content/Speaker/1139 |publisher=RightNow Media |accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry and public life==
Tada founded Joni and Friends in 1979, an organization to "accelerate [[Christian]] ministry in the disability community"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joniandfriends.org/about-us/|title=About Us |website=''joniandfriends.org''| publisher=Joni and Friends|access-date=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the world. In 2007 the Joni and Friends International Disability Center in [[Agoura Hills, California]], was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joniandfriends.org/radio/4-minute/joni-and-friends-international-disability-center/|title=The Joni and Friends International Disability Center |website=''joniandfriends.org''| publisher=Joni and Friends|access-date=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by Tada and Doug Mazza (President and COO), the Joni and Friends International Disability Center runs a multi-faceted non-profit covering a number of program outlets. The longest running program is "Joni and Friends Radio", a five-minute radio program begun in 1982. It now runs four minutes in length and can be heard each weekday on over 1,000 broadcast outlets. Tada also records a one-minute radio broadcast "Diamonds in the Dust" that airs daily. Both programs have received awards: "Joni and Friends Radio" received the "Radio Program of the Year"&lt;ref name="Ambassador"&gt;{{cite web |title=Joni Eareckson Tada |url=https://ambassadoradvertising.com/portfolio-posts/joni-eareckson-tada/ |website=ambassadoradvertising.com |publisher=Ambassador Advertising |accessdate=December 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; award from [[National Religious Broadcasters]] in 2002 and "Diamonds in the Dust" won the same award in 2011 in the short program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Diamonds in the Dust Named NRB Short Form Radio Program of the Year |url=http://nrb.org/news-room/press_center/diamondsi-in-the-dust-named-nrb-short-form-radio-program-of-the/ |website=National Religious Broadcasters |accessdate=December 2, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Joni and Friends programs include Family Retreats (a camp/retreat experience for families affected by disability), Wounded Warrior Getaways (which offer a similar experience for families of Wounded Warriors),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Family Retreats |url=https://www.joniandfriends.org/family-retreats/ |website=Joni and Friends |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wheels for the World (collects manual wheelchairs and other mobility devices which are refurbished by volunteers in prison restoration shops then shipped overseas where the wheelchairs are fitted by physical therapists to people in developing nations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wheels for the World |url=https://www.joniandfriends.org/wheels-for-the-world/ |website=Joni and Friends |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joni and Friends also has produced 51 episodes of ''Joni and Friends TV'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Television Series |url=https://www.joniandfriends.org/television/ |website=Joni and Friends |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; overseen the formation of the Christian Institute on Disability (a training and advocacy arm of Joni and Friends), among other ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Christian Institute on Disability |url=https://www.joniandfriends.org/christian-institute-on-disability/ |website=Joni and Friends |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the main office of Joni and Friends still resides in Agoura Hills, California, smaller offices can be found across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Area Ministries |url=https://www.joniandfriends.org/area-ministries/ |website=Joni and Friends |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Tada was appointed to the Disability Advisory Committee of the [[United States State Department|U.S. State Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Advisory Committee on Persons with Disabilities |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/51021.htm |website="2001-2009.state.gov" |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tada is a conference speaker. Her articles have been published in ''[[Christianity Today]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Joni Eareckson Tada: Suffering Helps Me See Heaven |url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/women/2018/november/joni-eareckson-tada-suffering-helps-me-see-heaven.html |publisher=Christianity Today |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Today's Christian Woman'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Joni Eareckson Tada |url=https://www.todayschristianwoman.com/whoweare/advisors/joni-eareckson-tada.html |website=Today's Christian Woman |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The War Cry]]'' ([[Salvation Army]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bible Idiots – Movie Review |url=http://www.thewarcry.org/2016/03/02/bible-idiots-movie-review/ |website=War Cry |accessdate=December 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and newspapers around the world.

Tada received media attention in 2014 for her performance of the title song from the Christian film ''[[Alone yet Not Alone]]''.

Domestic [[U.S. Air Mail]] was established as a new class of mail service by the [[United States]] [[Post Office Department]] (POD) on May 15, 1918, with the inauguration of the Washington&amp;ndash;Philadelphia&amp;ndash;New York route. Special [[postage stamps]] were issued for use with this service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1400048427 The Official Blackbook Price Guide to U.S. Postage Stamps 2005], 27th Edition (Official Blackbook Price Guide to United States Postage Stamps) by Thomas E.

[[Scott catalog]]ed stamps received a "C" designation for airmail issues beginning in 1940.  Designated for international mail, and showing a small airplane, the January, 2012 $1.05 Scenic America series issue was designated C150.  However, with the January, 2013 issue of the $1.10 Global [[Forever Stamp]] no specific airmail purpose was shown in the design.  Rather, the Postal Service stated that this "stamp offers a single price for any First-Class Mail International 1-ounce letter to any country in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://store.usps.com/store/browse/productDetailSingleSku.jsp?productId=S_578804&amp;categoryId=subcatS_S_Sheets Global Forever]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a regular series Scott number, 4740, was designated.

The '''Londesborough Brooch''' is a [[Celts|Celtic]] pseudo-[[penannular brooch]] from Ireland. Dating from the early medieval period, it is a particularly elaborate example of a dress fastener that was produced during Ireland's artistic golden age, when objects such as the [[Tara Brooch]] and [[Ardagh Chalice]] were produced. Since 1888, it has been part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=98321&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Londesborough+brooch&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==
The brooch and pin were cast in [[silver]], though the metal is heavily debased, and tests show it contains about 65% copper, 34% silver, with traces of lead and gold.&lt;ref name=Youngs&gt;Youngs, 93&lt;/ref&gt;  This might reflect an origin in melted-down late Roman coins. The pieces were thickly [[gilding|gilded]] on the front, and selectively on parts of the back of the head. The pin was cast in two pieces, head and shank, joined with a [[rivet]].  Both head and pin were ornamented with geometric and [[zoomorphic]] patterns and inset with [[amber]] pieces, some now missing.  On the back of the head there are two blue glass studs near where the large terminal joins the hoop.  There are many small differences between the decoration of the right and left sides of the head, although the overall impression is one of symmetry.  Many details of the decoration recall the earlier Tara Brooch and the [[Breadalbane Brooch]] (the latter also in the British Museum).  However, unlike most other very elaborate brooches of the type, the Londesborough Brooch lacks any gold [[filigree]] decoration, and aspects of the decoration recall larger pieces of church metal work such as shrines.&lt;ref name="Youngs" /&gt;  
[[Image:Brit Mus 17sept 016.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Detail of the brooch]]

==Original ownership==

The intricate decoration on precious metal and the large size of the brooch suggest it was made for a wealthy patron or religious leader in Ireland in the late eighth or early ninth centuries AD.&lt;ref name="Youngs" /&gt;  The pseudo-penannular form is typical of Irish brooches at this period; in a true penannular brooch there is a gap in the centre of the wide terminals ending the hoop through which the pin can pass.  In the pseudo-penannular type the terminal sides are joined, here by two narrow bands, making the brooch less efficient as a fastener.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 89-90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Little is known about the original circumstances of the brooch's discovery before it became part of [[Albert Denison, 1st Baron Londesborough|Lord Londesborough]]'s collection. The British Museum purchased the brooch in 1888. With the Tara Brooch in [[Dublin]], and the [[Hunterston Brooch]] in [[Edinburgh]], it is considered one of the finest of over 50 highly elaborate Irish Celtic brooches to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 90&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:What-is-This-my-Son-Tom-1774.jpg|right|thumb|"What is this my Son Tom?", 1774]]
A '''macaroni''' (or formerly '''maccaroni''')&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]''; Compare [[fop]].&lt;/ref&gt; in mid-18th-century England was a fashionable fellow who dressed and even spoke in an outlandishly affected and [[epicene]] manner. The term pejoratively referred to a man who "exceeded the ordinary bounds of fashion"&lt;ref&gt;''The Macaroni and Theatrical Magazine'', inaugural issue, 1772, quoted in Amelia Rauser, "Hair, Authenticity, and the Self-Made Macaroni", ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'' '''38'''.1 (2004:101-117) ([http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/eighteenth-century_studies/v038/38.1rauser.html on-line abstract]).&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of clothes, fastidious eating, and gambling. He mixed Continental affectations with his English nature, like a practitioner of [[macaronic verse]] (which mixed English and Latin to comic effect), laying himself open to satire:
{{quote|There is indeed a kind of animal, neither male nor female, a thing of the neuter gender, lately [1770] started up among us. It is called a macaroni. It talks without meaning, it smiles without pleasantry, it eats without appetite, it rides without exercise, it wenches without passion.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Oxford Magazine]]'', 1770, quoted in  Joseph Twadell Shipley, ''The Origins of English Words: A Discursive Dictionary of Indo-European Roots'' (JHU Press) 1984:143.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The macaronis were precursor to the [[dandy|dandies]], who came as a more masculine reaction to the excesses of the macaroni, far from their present connotation of effeminacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktieguide.com/History/02.htm |title=Tuxedo Style &amp; Etiquette |publisher=The Black Tie Guide |date= |accessdate=2013-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and etymology ==

Young men who had been to Italy on the [[Grand Tour]] had developed a taste for ''maccaroni'', a type of [[pasta]] little known in England then, and so they were said to belong to the ''Macaroni Club''.&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;{{cite web| title= Macaroni| work= Oxford English Dictionary | accessdate=2011-01-18  | url= http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/111762}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would refer to anything that was fashionable or ''à la mode'' as "very maccaroni". &lt;ref&gt;Rauser 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horace Walpole]] wrote to a friend in 1764 of "the Macaroni Club, which is composed of all the traveled young men who wear long curls and spying-glasses". {{cit|date=April 2015}} The "club" was not a formal one; the expression was particularly used to characterize [[fop]]s who dressed in high fashion with tall, powdered [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] with a [[chapeau|chapeau bras]] on top that could only be removed on the point of a sword.

The shop of engravers and printsellers [[Mary and Matthew Darly]] in the fashionable [[West End of London]] sold their sets of satirical "macaroni" caricature prints, published between 1771 and 1773. The new Darly shop became known as "the Macaroni Print-Shop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/eighteenth-century_studies/v038/38.1rauser.html |title=Amelia Faye Rauser, "Hair, Authenticity, and the Self-Made Macaroni" '&amp;#39;Eighteenth-Century Studies'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'38'&amp;#39;':1 |doi=10.1353/ecs.2004.0063 |publisher=muse.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian term ''maccherone'', figuratively meaning  "blockhead, fool", was not related to this British usage.&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt;

==Examples of usage==
In 1773, [[James Boswell]] was on tour in Scotland with the stout and serious-minded essayist and lexicographer Dr. [[Samuel Johnson]], the least dandified of Londoners. Johnson was awkward in the saddle, and Boswell ribbed him: "You are a delicate Londoner; you are a maccaroni; you can't ride."&lt;ref&gt;James Boswell, ''Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides'', 1785, chapter 7 [http://www.gutenkarte.org/section/6018/7 available on-line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311060500/http://www.gutenkarte.org/section/6018/7 |date=2007-03-11 }}; he liked it well enough to repeat it in his ''Life of Dr. Johnson.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Oliver Goldsmith]]'s ''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'' (1773), a misunderstanding is discovered and young Marlow finds that he has been mistaken; he cries out, "So then, all's out, and I have been damnably imposed on. O, confound my stupid head, I shall be laughed at over the whole town. I shall be stuck up in caricatura in all the print-shops. The Dullissimo Maccaroni. To mistake this house of all others for an inn, and my father's old friend for an innkeeper!"

The song "[[Yankee Doodle]]" from the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]] mentions a man who "stuck a feather in his hat and called it macaroni." Dr. Richard Shuckburgh was a British surgeon and also the author of the song's lyrics; the joke which he was making was that the Yankees were naive enough to believe that a feather in the hat was a sufficient mark of a macaroni. Whether or not these were alternative lyrics sung in the British army, they were enthusiastically taken up by the [[Yankee]]s themselves.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Yankee Doodle#Variations and parodies|Yankee Doodle variations and parodies]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Michael Jordan statue''', also known as '''''The Spirit''''' (and sometimes referred to as '''''Michael Jordan's Spirit'''''), is a bronze sculpture by [[Omri Amrany]] and [[Julie Rotblatt-Amrany]] that has been located inside the [[United Center]] in the [[Near West Side, Chicago|Near West Side]] [[Community areas of Chicago|community area]] of Chicago since March 1, 2017. The sculpture was originally commissioned after Jordan's initial retirement following three consecutive NBA championships and unveiled prior to the Bulls taking residence in their new home stadium the following year. Depicting [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Basketball Hall of Fame]] member [[Michael Jordan]] and unveiled outside the United Center on November 1, 1994, the {{convert|12|ft|m|1|adj=on}} sculpture stands atop a {{convert|5|ft|m|2|adj=on}} [[black granite]] base. Although not critically well received, the statue has established its own legacy as a meeting place for fans at subsequent Bulls championships and as a rallying point for [[Chicago Blackhawks]] fans during their prideful times.

==History==

===Background===
Michael Jordan had spent his entire career with the Chicago Bulls since being drafted in the [[1984 NBA Draft]] by the team with the third overall selection. Eventually, he led the Bulls to three consecutive championships in the [[1991 NBA Finals|1991]], [[1992 NBA Finals|1992]] and [[1993 NBA Finals]]. During each of these championship seasons he was an [[List of NBA All-Stars|NBA All-Star]], [[List of National Basketball Association season scoring leaders|NBA scoring champion]], [[All-NBA Team]] first team selection, [[NBA All-Defensive Team]] first team selection, and the [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/michael_jordan/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206100650/http://www.nba.com/playerfile/michael_jordan/|accessdate=September 18, 2011|archivedate=February 6, 2008|title=Michael Jordan – 23|publisher=[[NBA.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/jordan_bio.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707083040/http://www.nba.com/history/players/jordan_bio.html|accessdate=September 18, 2011|archivedate=July 7, 2006|title=Full Name: Michael Jeffrey Jordan|work=NBA Encyclopedia Playoff Edition|publisher=[[NBA.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Jordan retired following the [[1992–93 NBA season]], [[Chicago Bulls]] owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] sought a sculptor to honor Jordan and requested that Chicago Bulls Vice President Steve Schanwald seek proposals from artists.&lt;ref name=MJS/&gt; Twelve artists made proposals.&lt;ref name=TsbMJS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/story-behind-michael-jordans-spirit.html|title=The story behind Michael Jordan's Spirit|accessdate=September 3, 2011|publisher=[[NBA.com]]|author=Fluck, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1994, Schanwald hired Omri and Julie Rotblatt-Amrany of [[Highland Park, Illinois]], who erected a statue at the Bulls' new home for the [[1994–95 NBA season]], the [[United Center]].&lt;ref name=MJS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedcenter.com/unitedcenter/MichaelJordanStatue.asp|title=Michael Jordan Statue|accessdate=September 3, 2011|publisher=[[United Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1994 when they both moved, the Bulls and Blackhawks had played at [[Chicago Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1285.html|title=United Center|accessdate=September 18, 2011|work=[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]]|author=Greene, Daniel|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]/[[Newberry Library]]|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/268.html|title=Chicago Stadium|accessdate=September 18, 2011|work=[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]]|author=Hayner, Donald A.|publisher=[[Chicago Historical Society]]/[[Newberry Library]]|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation and installation===
[[File:Michael Jordan Achievements.jpg|thumb|Base of statue (right side) at the United Center chronicling Jordan's career achievements.]]
While the sculpture was a work in progress, the location of the sculptor's rented studio was kept secret from the public, while the husband-and-wife sculptor team and three assistants spent four months working for sixteen hours every day of the week.&lt;ref name=HS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-11-27/features/9411270183_1_highland-park-north-shore-michael-jordan|title=High-flying Sculptors: Meet The Couple Who Immortalized Michael Jordan In Bronze|accessdate=September 3, 2011|date=November 27, 1994|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Revsine, Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process involved two sittings with Jordan for measurements and photos, including one in which the clay version had to be driven from Chicago to Nashville, to ensure the accuracy of the clay likeness.&lt;ref name=TsbMJS/&gt; The {{convert|2000|lbs|kg|1|adj=on}} sculpture, which is {{convert|12|ft|m|1}} tall, rests on a 5-foot high black granite base that has an inscription reading "The best there ever was. The best there ever will be."  The base also includes a list of his accomplishments. The bronze statue used [[lost-wax casting]].&lt;ref name=MJS/&gt; The sculpture has led to a lot of similar work for the couple.&lt;ref name=TsbMJS/&gt;

The sculpture's official address is United Center, 1901 W.

The sculpture was installed on October 31&lt;ref name=TsbMJS/&gt; and unveiled on November 1, 1994 in front of a national audience by Jordan, Reinsdorf and [[Larry King]].  Jordan's jersey number was retired during the ceremony.&lt;ref name=MJS/&gt; Only Jordan's knee is attached to the base via a triple-steel post.&lt;ref name=MJS/&gt;&lt;ref name=TsbMJS/&gt;  A stationary [[basketball hoop]] was almost part of the sculpture too.&lt;ref name=TsbMJS/&gt; The sculpture, which is hollow, was designed to withstand the natural elements.&lt;ref name=TsbMJS/&gt; After his second retirement following the [[1997–98 NBA season]], the following quote from the 1992 [[film]] ''[[A River Runs Through It (film)|A River Runs Through It]]'' was added to the base: "At that moment I knew, surely and clearly, that I was witnessing perfection. He stood before us, suspended above the earth, free from all its laws like a work of art, and I knew, just as surely and clearly, that life is not a work of art, and that the moment could not last."&lt;ref name=MJS/&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
Some complain that the sculpture does not depict Jordan's well-known open-mouthed tongue wag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-11-07/news/9411070187_1_statue-tongue-larry-king|title=Even In Bronze, Jordan Spirit Is A Real Magnet|accessdate=September 3, 2011|date=November 7, 1994|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Rhodes, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' art critic Alan G. Artner says the inscription at the base that reads "The best there ever was.

'''''Mirth &amp; Girth''''' is a portrait painting by [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC) student David K. Nelson, Jr., depicting the recently deceased, popular African-American mayor of [[Chicago]], [[Harold Washington]] wearing only a bra, [[G-string]], garter belt and stockings.&lt;ref name="hanania_19880514"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DD4093DE240&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |work=Chicago Tribune |title=Controversial painting reported damaged |author1=Hanania, Mark  |author2=Padgett, Tim  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=May 14, 1988 |accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief showing at a May 11, 1988 private student exhibition in the Art Institute, angry African-American [[Chicago City Council|aldermen]], including Ald. [[Allan Streeter]],  Ald. [[Bobby Rush]] and Ald. [[Dorothy Tillman]],  arrived with [[Chicago Police Department]] officers and confiscated the painting, triggering a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and race relations crisis and a civil lawsuit.

[[Freedom of speech|Free-speech]] advocates condemned the seizure of the painting, while the aldermen maintained that the painting was an insult to Washington and should have been taken down. Some students at the SAIC showed their support for free speech by holding rallies in front of the school and at the [[Richard J. Daley Plaza]], while other students criticized Nelson for poor timing in showing a racially insensitive image.

At some point between when the painting was confiscated and when it was returned, a {{convert|5|in|cm|0|adj=on}} gash was made on the canvas. Nelson filed a federal lawsuit against the city, claiming that the painting's confiscation and subsequent damaging violated his First Amendment rights. He and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) settled with the city for $95,000 (1994; {{Inflation|US|95000|1994|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) in compensation for the damaged painting after the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]] upheld the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois|lower court's]] decision.&lt;ref name="tribune_19940928" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Harold Washington, the subject of the portrait, was elected in 1965 to the [[Illinois House of Representatives]]. After the death of [[Richard J. Daley]] in late 1976, Washington won Chicago's 1983 Democratic mayoral primary election. He was elected mayor, prevailing over [[Bernard Epton]] in a racially polarizing general election.&lt;ref name=levinsohn&gt;{{cite book |title=Harold Washington: A Political Biography |last=Hamlish Levinsohn |first=Florence |year=1983 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location=Chicago |pages=265–266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first four-year term was characterized by the [[Council Wars]], a period of political conflict with the mostly white aldermanic majority in [[Chicago City Council|City Council]].&lt;ref name="rivlin_209-210"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fire on the Prairie: Chicago's Harold Washington and the Politics of Race |author=Rivlin, Gary |year=1992 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-1468-3 |pages=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven Washington-backed aldermanic challengers prevailed in the April, 1986 special municipal election, facilitating progress with Washington's agenda.

=== Creation of painting ===
Shortly after Washington's death, Nelson (who is white)&lt;ref name="schmidt_19880513"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6D6153EF930A25756C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |work=New York Times |title=Chicago aldermen and police seize portrait that blacks deem offensive |date=May 13, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-14 |author=Schmidt, William E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; painted ''Mirth &amp; Girth'', a "full-length frontal portrait of a portly grim-faced Harold Washington clad in a white bra and G-string, garter belt, and stockings".&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt; The painting was approximately {{convert|4|ft|cm|0}} tall by {{convert|3|ft|cm|0}} wide.&lt;ref name="brenson_19880529"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE1DA1F38F93AA15756C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=A savage painting raises troubling questions |author=Brenson, Michael |date=May 29, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-14 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the portrait, Washington is holding a pencil in his right hand. His aide, Alton Miller, initially mistook Washington's slumping over his desk as an attempt to pick up a pencil that had fallen onto the floor.&lt;ref name="dubin_29"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dubin | first = Steven C. | title = Arresting Images&amp;nbsp;— Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions | publisher = Routledge, Chapman, and Hall Inc.  | year = 1992 | location = New York, NY U.S.A. | pages = 29 | isbn = 0-415-90893-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rivlin_403"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fire on the Prairie: Chicago's Harold Washington and the Politics of Race |author=Rivlin, Gary |year=1992 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |location=New York |isbn=0-8050-1468-3 |page=403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="davis_19880513_2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DEBFF29B67B3&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Art School in Political Crossfire |work=Chicago Tribune |author=Davis, Robert |accessdate=2008-04-22 |date=May 13, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the piece is presumably derived from [[Girth &amp; Mirth]], an organization for [[Chub (gay culture)|overweight gay men]].&lt;ref name="dubin_32"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dubin | first = Steven C. | title = Arresting Images&amp;nbsp;— Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions | publisher = Routledge, Chapman, and Hall Inc.  | year = 1992 | location = New York, NY U.S.A. | pages = 32 | isbn = 0-415-90893-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', Nelson stated that he had painted ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' over the course of one night, standing in his underwear. He said that he had painted it in response to how the city populace revered Washington shortly after his death. Nelson stated, "(i)n Chicago, at this time, Harold Washington is like an icon. He's like a deity." In particular, Nelson painted the portrait after seeing prints of "Worry Ye Not", another poster that depicted a smiling Washington with a blue-robe adorned [[Jesus Christ]], looking down on the Chicago skyline.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DD3D90C4278&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Art Institute surrenders&amp;nbsp;— Will bar controversial painting of Washington |date=May 13, 1988 |accessdate=January 27, 1988 |author1=Hanania, Ray  |author2=Cronin, Barry  |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Chicago Sun Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D9163AF934A25751C0A96F948260 |title=The Editorial Notebook; Chicago Seeks a Winning Coalition |author=Wycliff, Don |work=The New York Times |date=February 17, 1989 |accessdate=2008-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson later testified that he had based the iconoclastic elements of the painting on a rumor that doctors at [[Northwestern Memorial Hospital]] had discovered female underwear beneath the suit Washington was wearing at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="pp"&gt;[http://www.projectposner.org/case/1994/16F3d145 Nelson v.

The caricature was not Nelson's first. He had drawn a portrait of his mother as ''[[Whistler's Mother]]'' for Mother's Day. Nelson had also drawn a caricature of his father as the model depicted on boxes of [[Cream of Wheat]].  Nelson explained, "(t)his kind of irreverence and iconoclasm runs through all my artwork". In an April Fools' Day edition of a ''[[Weekly World News]]'' parody produced by Nelson, he illustrated SAIC president Edward Jones as an infant in the arms of a bare-breasted [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DF07B02FACEB&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |author=Schlesinger, Toni |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 22, 1998 |accessdate=2008-01-26 |title=The mayoral painter's 15 minutes of fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Display and confiscation ==

=== Initial display ===
On May 11, 1988, ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' was displayed at a private exhibition in one of the school's main interior hallways. The painting was part of a set of six that Nelson was displaying in a judged three-day student fellowship exhibition held to showcase upcoming graduates. Another of his works was a self-portrait titled "I'm Sensitive, and I Love All Humanity", depicting Nelson holding little people of multiple nationalities.&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt; As soon as the exhibit opened, between 7:30 and 8:30 am, the painting drew enough negative attention for the Art Institute to post a security guard in front of the painting. Shortly thereafter, the school began to receive angry phone calls about the painting.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Soon after the exhibit opened, word of the controversy reached the [[Chicago City Council]], which was in session. Alderman [[Bobby Rush]] (then of the 2nd ward)&lt;ref name="siewers_19880512"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DD390636B54&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |work=Chicago Sun-Times |author1=Siewers, Alf  |author2=Hanania, Ray  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=May 12, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-02 |title=Controversial painting leads to brush with law}}&lt;/ref&gt; immediately put together a resolution that would cut off the city's contribution to the Art Institute unless it apologized for displaying the painting. In part, the resolution read "Whereas, the artist David Nelson obviously exhibits some type of demented and pathological mental capacities&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; Another resolution was written that asked the Art Institute to remove the painting immediately. After passing both items, a group of aldermen left to deliver the resolutions to the Art Institute.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Nelson returned to the painting about an hour after it was first displayed. He had forgotten a hammer and nails to hang the painting, and had left it leaning against the wall for an hour. Shortly after he returned, city aldermen, police officers and local reporters arrived at the scene, leading to a dramatic confrontation between aldermen and other students, while Nelson remained incognito nearby.&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt;

=== Confiscation ===
Aldermen [[Edward Jones (Illinois politician)|Edward Jones]] (20th) and [[William C. Henry]] (24th) were the first aldermen to arrive from the City Council session. According to the federal lawsuit, Henry showed he had a gun, and then with Jones removed the now-hung painting from the wall and placed it on the floor, facing the wall. After they left, another student rehung the painting. Three other aldermen, [[Allan Streeter]] (17th), [[Dorothy Tillman]] (3rd) and Rush, arrived later. They took down the painting and attempted to remove it from the school, but were stopped by a school official. The aldermen then took the painting to the office of the school president Anthony Jones (no relation to Edward Jones). The painting had a {{convert|5|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} gash,&lt;ref name="hanania_19880514" /&gt; and it had been wrapped in brown paper.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

Alderman Tillman threatened to burn the painting in President Jones' office, but a [[Chicago Police Department]] (CPD) lieutenant present with the aldermen, Lt. Raymond Patterson, advised against this. Instead, another unnamed alderman called CPD [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]] Leroy Martin. Martin telephoned Patterson in Jones' office and ordered Patterson to take the painting into police custody, telling Jones that the painting amounted to "incitement to riot". Patterson overrode this direct order, citing his own powers as the lieutenant on the scene and hung up on Martin. A CPD sergeant accompanied Rush, Streeter and Tillman to a waiting police car with the wrapped painting in hand. Parts of the incident were later broadcast on television.&lt;ref name="tribune_19940928"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB4261ADA2A3328&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Paying the bill for a tantrum |author=Chicago Tribune Editorial Board |work=Chicago Tribune |date=September 28, 1994 |accessdate=2008-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="crimmins_19880512"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DEB5A2DBA8BD&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Student's painting causes stir |author1=Crimmins, Jerry  |author2=Davis, Robert  |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 12, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident was marked by a volatile shouting match between the aldermen and students, and met with condemnation from free-speech advocates. As the aldermen escorted the painting to the police vehicle, a mass of students outside of the Art Institute jeered them, naming the aldermen "commies", "fascists", "[[brownshirt]]s" and "[[Philistinism|philistines]]".&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"/&gt; Seventeen bomb threats were recorded at the school after the controversy erupted.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt;

== Responses ==

=== African-American community ===
Shortly after the incident, a black alderman told reporters that he believed the painting was the work of a Jewish artist. Nelson replied through a ''Chicago Tribune'' story that he "is not Jewish".&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt; The remark was made in part because racial tensions had already been elevated a week earlier after the firing of [[Steve Cokely]], a mayoral aide, by African-American mayor and Harold Washington's successor [[Eugene Sawyer]]. Cokely had accused Jews of "engaging in an international conspiracy for world control". His firing caused a rift in segments of the black community, leading some to believe that Sawyer was also involved in the same conspiracy.&lt;ref name="lipinski_19880506"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DE8B553106E6&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Sawyer fires Cokeley as aide&amp;nbsp;— somber mayor asks city to look beyond controversy |date=May 6, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |work=Chicago Tribune |author=[[Ann Marie Lipinski]] and Baquet, Dean.

In a ''[[New York Times]]'' article published on May 13, 1988, Alderman Streeter reiterated his stance regarding the removal of the painting, saying that he would have "gone to jail to get that painting down", calling it "an insult to a great man and an affront to blacks".&lt;ref name="schmidt_19880513"/&gt; On May 16, 1988, Streeter appeared on [[WTTW|the local public television station]] news program ''[[Chicago Tonight]]''.

Farrakhan referred to Washington as "a father figure for black people", and described the painting and subsequent lawsuit "a total disrespect for our feelings and our community".&lt;ref name="mcwhirter_19941213"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB4259BB0E51944&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Farrakhan supports 3 in art flap |date=February 13, 1994 |accessdate=2008-01-26 |work=Chicago Tribune |author=McWhirter, Cameron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 12, 1988, representatives from the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) picked up the painting and returned it to Nelson. Jay Miller, another representative for the ACLU, described the incident as "vigilante stuff", noting that the action "was done in the name of one of the great civil libertarians of our time. Harold Washington had a 100&amp;nbsp;percent voting record in Congress and in the state Legislature on issues of civil liberties and civil rights."&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"/&gt; In 1984 Washington had supported the civil rights of sculptor John Sefick after Sefick had created a satirical statue of Washington.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; By comparison, former mayor [[Michael Bilandic]] had ordered a Sefick statue satirizing his handling of Chicago's crippling [[Chicago Blizzard of 1979|Blizzard of 1979]] covered by a blanket, a decision that was later overturned in federal court.&lt;ref name="kendall_19880502"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DE6EE0F3AE64&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Sculptor carves governor's likeness with a barb |author=Kendall, Peter |date=May 2, 1988 |accessdate=2008-05-16 |work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students from the SAIC protested on [[Columbus Drive (Chicago)|Columbus Drive]] the next day, holding signs that asked drivers to "honk for free speech". Student leaders began to consult attorneys to file a lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department and the aldermen. Other groups of students planned a "[[Human Be-In|be-in]]" at the [[Richard J. Daley Center|Richard J. Daley Plaza]], but it was canceled after the students learned other groups might cause a confrontation.&lt;ref name="kendall_19880515"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DED1DD99B969&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Art Institute graduation turns out to be the picture of calm |date=May 15, 1988 |accessdate=2008-05-16 |author1=Kendall, Peter  |author2=Hunt, Maria  |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some students felt that the school had been a victim of racial politics, and that the incident would be used to censor the Art Institute.&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513" /&gt;

On ''Chicago Tonight'', Daniel Polsby, a law professor at [[Northwestern University]], cited federal statutes violated during the confiscation of the portrait. He then faulted Marshall Field's reluctance to defend the First Amendment, further comparing the seizure of ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' to then-Arkansas governor [[Orval Faubus]]' refusal to abide by the First Amendment and allow minorities to enroll in [[Little Rock Central High School]]. According to Polsby, Faubus' rationale at the time was to preserve a delicate civil rights situation. Polsby called the aldermen's action "crushingly ironic and terribly sad".&lt;ref name="suntimes_chicago_tonight" /&gt;

=== Reactions within the SAIC ===
At the SAIC, students' characterizations of the painting ranged from political caricature, to "whimsy", to a commercial success. One student noted that Nelson was "known nationally now, which is every artist's dream". Another student noted that "(a)rtists have to be responsible for what they make, and this guy is not being responsible". In a meeting with 100&amp;nbsp;students after the incident, Anthony Jones, then-president of the SAIC, assured the students that he stood behind their First Amendment rights. Regarding the painting, Jones said that the painting was in poor taste and should not have been displayed.&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513" /&gt;

Members of the Art Institute Board met the day after the incident and agreed not to display ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' any further. Chairman Marshall Field also issued a formal apology for displaying the painting and agreed to consider demands that the school both hire more black administrators and accept more black students. Field also published the apology in each of the city's daily metropolitan newspapers.&lt;ref name="hanania_19880513"/&gt; After the apology was issued, Polsby strongly criticized Field's refusal to more aggressively stand up for the students' First Amendment rights.&lt;ref name="suntimes_chicago_tonight" /&gt;

=== Other reactions ===
Members of the Council of Religious Leaders of Metropolitan Chicago, which included leaders from mainline Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish organizations from the city, issued a statement that expressed "moral dismay" over the painting. They further added that the display of the painting showed "a lack of sensitivity which we could have expected from those who were responsible for its showing".&lt;ref name="schmidt_19880513" /&gt;

As for the painting's critical reception, one local art reviewer mentioned that "the only thing [the SAIC] might have felt sheepish about was not having a staff that in four years could instill in Nelson a better grasp of figure painting".&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; In a newspaper interview, Nelson responded that the criticism was "the one thing that did make me kind of angry. I don't think the painting was poorly executed, though it wasn't my favorite painting."&lt;ref name="schesinger_19980522" /&gt; In his book ''Arresting Images&amp;nbsp;— Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions'', Stephen C. Dubin suggested that the painting represented a symbolic castration of Washington, reflecting more "traditional" reactions to African-Americans in positions of power.&lt;ref name="dubin_36"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dubin | first = Steven C. | title = Arresting Images&amp;nbsp;— Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions | publisher = Routledge, Chapman, and Hall Inc.  | year = 1992 | location = New York, NY U.S.A. | pages = 36 | isbn = 0-415-90893-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson gave only a few interviews before leaving Chicago for the suburbs, and then [[Graceland]] to avoid the press.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; On the advice of his friends, Nelson stayed away from his graduation ceremony on May 14, 1988.&lt;ref name="kendall_19880515" /&gt; He turned down a $15,000 (1988, $22,000 in 2008) offer for the painting, calling it a "grossly inflated" price. He also turned down a separate opportunity to appear on [[Phil Donahue]]'s syndicated talk show, saying that he never watched the show and was genuinely uninterested in the offer.&lt;ref name="nae" /&gt; Other than the interview with WLUP, Nelson's views were expressed by Harvey Grossman, the legal director for the ACLU. Through Grossman, Nelson said he would not press for the returning of the painting, as it had fulfilled its purpose of "drawing attention to his '[[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]]' work".&lt;ref name="davis_19880513"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF7DEBF1E8DADB6&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Politics takes its place in the world of art |date=May 13, 1988 |accessdate=2008-02-09 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |author=Davis, Robert and [[Ann Marie Lipinski]].

== ''Nelson v. Streeter'' ==
On June 23, 1988, the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Nelson against the three aldermen who were seen on television handling the painting.&lt;ref name="pitt_19880624"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DE207421D41&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |work=Chicago Tribune |author=Pitt, Leon |date=June 24, 1988 |accessdate=2007-02-09 |title=Suit hits seizure of Washington painting}}&lt;/ref&gt; It claimed the removal of the painting violated Nelson's First Amendment right to freedom of expression, [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] right to protection from unreasonable seizures, and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth amendment]] right against being deprived of property without a hearing. The ACLU sought $100,000 (1988, {{Inflation|US|100000|1988|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) to compensate Nelson for damage to the painting, and to "punish" the aldermen and police for their actions.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pitt_19880624" /&gt;

Ald. Robert Shaw (9th) called the suit "a slap in the face to the black community". Rush questioned the motive of the suit, as himself, Tillman and Streeter all were supporters of Alderman [[Timothy C. Evans]] (17th), a political rival of mayor Eugene Sawyer. Rush specifically called the suit "frivolous" and "impetuous", openly questioning whether the ACLU had filed the suit to enhance fundraising activities or for other political reasons.&lt;ref name="pitt_19880624" /&gt;

The City of Chicago refused in February 1990 to pay mounting legal costs for the aldermen. The aldermen argued that they were performing their official duties "in protecting the security of the city during the turmoil created by the exhibit" when they removed the painting. The city contended that the aldermen had taken the action as individuals.&lt;ref name="strong_19900210"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FF82825B81D1A52&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Aldermen ask city: Pay our art flap costs |author=Strong, James |work=Chicago Tribune |date=February 10, 1990 |accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson refused a $10,000 (1990, {{Inflation|US|10000|1990|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) settlement at the time.&lt;ref name="hanania_19900210"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB372CC0FC12A41&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Aldermen sued in art tiff want city to pay lawyer |work=Chicago Sun-Times |author=Hanania, Ray |date=February 10, 1990 |accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 1992, U.S. District Judge George Lindberg dismissed the City of Chicago from the lawsuit, but ruled that Superintendent Martin must go to trial and that the three aldermen violated Nelson's civil rights. Lindberg supported the recommendations regarding that issue [[United States magistrate judge|Magistrate Judge]] Elaine Bucklo's had made in March&amp;nbsp;1992. Tillman's lawyer, James Chapman, recommended to Tillman that an immediate appeal be filed in federal court.&lt;ref name="oconnor_19920811"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FFEE336AB06BEAD&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Judge rules for artist in '88 case |date=August 11, 1992 |accessdate=2008-02-09 |author=O'Connor, Matt.

{{Quote box
| quote  = So we must ask whether in 1988 the law was clear that local government officials may not go onto private property without invitation (the aldermen had not been invited to the exhibition of student work), seize a painting that they do not like because it vilifies a public official with whom they had been associated, and wrap it in brown paper and remove it so that no one can see it. To ask the question is pretty much to answer it. As Chief Justice Warren said in another case involving an effort to suppress public criticism of a mayor of Chicago, "This is a simple case."

| width  = 35%
| align  = right
}}

=== Appellate court ===
In the appeal, decided February 1, 1994, judges [[Richard Posner]], [[Frank H. Easterbrook]], and [[Michael Stephen Kanne]] affirmed Lindberg's earlier decision. Writing for the court, Posner rejected claims of official immunity and said city officials had no right to enter private property and take "offensive" paintings off its walls.&lt;ref name="ncac"&gt;[http://www.ncac.org/art-law/op-nel.cfm Nelson v. Streeter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515225219/http://ncac.org/art-law/op-nel.cfm |date=2008-05-15 }}, [[Case citation#Lower federal courts|16 F.3d 145]] ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|7th Cir.]] 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; He also rejected the argument that removing paintings from walls was an official duty.&lt;ref name=posner/&gt;

Posner also rejected the argument that the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which it might have been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, and that there was no mob. In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.&lt;ref name=posner/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncac" /&gt;

The appellate court also faulted the district judge for allowing "more than a year and a half elapsed before the filing and disposition of the motions for summary judgment". Posner noted in his opinion that "the governing principles are clear, the facts have been explored exhaustively, and the defendants should be aware that efforts to mount a last-ditch, no-holds-barred defense may simply increase their liability for the plaintiff's attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988." He then affirmed the district court's decision.&lt;ref name="ncac" /&gt;

=== Settlement and aftermath ===
On September 20, 1994, the city and the ACLU reached a settlement. The ACLU agreed to drop claims against the city and Superintendent LeRoy Martin.&lt;ref name="tribune_19940928" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lehmann_20080921"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB421DDDCC02773&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=City settles suit over Washington painting |date=September 21, 1994 |accessdate=2008-02-10 |author1=Lehmann, Daniel J.  |author2=Golab, Art  |lastauthoramp=yes |work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the city of Chicago agreed to pay Nelson and the ACLU $95,000 (1994, {{Inflation|US|95000|1994|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) for damage to the painting and to issue police procedures about what materials protected by the First Amendment may be seized.&lt;ref name="lehmann_20080921" /&gt; The elected officials also agreed not to appeal the district court's ruling.&lt;ref name="lehmann_20080921" /&gt; Left unresolved were the hundreds of thousands of dollars of legal fees owed to lawyers defending Tillman, Rush and Streeter; by September 1994, $200,000 (1994, {{Inflation|US|200000|1994|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) in fees were owed by Tillman alone.&lt;ref name="oconnor_19940921" /&gt; Earlier in the year, the City Council's Finance Committee voted against paying for the aldermen's legal fees. The vote split along racial lines, 12 to 8.&lt;ref name="spielman_19940223"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB4219C9E2B3DC4&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Council won't pay bills for 3 - aldermen's legal bills mount |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=February 23, 1994 |accessdate=2008-05-22 |author=Spielman, Fran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grossman stated that the relatively small settlement showed that Nelson had proceeded with the lawsuit "on a matter of principle". Tillman, however, called the settlement a "great victory", saying, "we didn't admit to anything, all the charges were dropped, we're not paying anything (in damages), and we preserve our rights to pursue efforts to have our legal fees paid". At the time the lawsuit was settled, Nelson did not issue any statements.&lt;ref name="lehmann_20080921" /&gt; The ''Chicago Tribune'' reported that he was employed as an advertising artist at an undisclosed firm; he continued to paint in his free time.&lt;ref name= oconnor_19940921&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB42617116B777C&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Suit ended on picture of Washington |author=O'Connor, Matt |work=Chicago Tribune |date=September 21, 1994 |accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1994, the painting had not been sold, exhibited, or repaired after the incident.&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;

The '''Multiverse''' is the [[shared fictional universe]] depicted on ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' cards, novels, comics, and other supplemental products.&lt;ref&gt;http://epicstream.com/news/Magic-The-Gathering-Finally-Meets-Dungeons--Dragons-For-The-Ultimate-Fantasy-RPG&lt;/ref&gt; Though ''Magic'' is a strategy game, an intricate storyline underlies the cards released in each expansion.  On the cards, elements of this [[multiverse]] are shown in the card art and through quotations and descriptions on the bottom of most cards (called [[flavor text]]). Novels and anthologies published by [[HarperPrism]] and [[Wizards of the Coast]] (WOTC), and the [[comic book]]s published by [[Valiant Comics|Armada Comics]] expand upon the settings and characters hinted at on the cards. WOTC also publishes a weekly story (most often related to the plane explored in the current expansion set) in the Magic Fiction column, previously known as Official Magic Fiction and Uncharted Realms.

In the early days of the game, the name 'Dominia' was used to describe the story universe but, due to confusion with the name of the plane/planet where the central events of ''Magic'' occur ([[#Dominaria|Dominaria]]), it fell into disuse and was replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dommermuth|first=Brady|title=Ask Wizards - February, 2007|url=http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/ask-wizards-february-2007-2007-02-01|work=Daily MTG|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cosmology==
The Multiverse is a collection of planes (described somewhat like [[pocket universe]]s) which are usually named after the primary planet contained within them. Travel between these planes is possible, and powerful beings known as Planeswalkers are capable of traversing between them.&lt;ref&gt;https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/you-are-planeswalker-2008-07-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Blind Eternities===

The Blind Eternities is the term more commonly used to describe the space between the planes of reality. Filled with chaotic, raw energies such as Aether, Mana and temporal energy, it is a place where matter and life as known within the planes of reality cannot subsist. (The only exceptions are the Planeswalkers, who briefly pass physically through it when they "walk" between planes.) As such, not much is known or understood about the Blind Eternities. Unfathomable, reality-warping cosmic horrors known as the Eldrazi are said to be born there.

===Aether===

Aether (previously spelled Æther) is the main type of energy filling the blind eternities, although it can also appear in variable quantities within the planes. It is inextricably associated with magic within Magic's [[shared fictional universe]] and the use of the word in several Magic cards implies that casting magic involves channeling and manipulating Aether. Similarly, "summoning" the creatures around which combat and much of gameplay in Magic revolves is described as "pulling (them) from the Aether".

===Dominaria===
The majority of the ''Magic'' story was set on the plane of Dominaria prior to [[Mirrodin]], encompassing long time periods each detailed in certain card sets or books. Dominaria is a unique nexus between all the other planes of the Multiverse.  Occasionally, such as in [[Time Spiral]], the storyline returns to it.

==Storylines==
* '''The Thran''':  The Thran were a race of master artificers who were destroyed by [[Yawgmoth]] and his [[Phyrexians]] (converted Thran following him) during the Thran-Phyrexian War about 5,000 years before the [[Antiquities (Magic: The Gathering)|Brothers]]. They are only hinted at in the game, but [[J. Robert King]]'s novel ''The Thran'' explores their culture in some depth.
* '''[[Antiquities (Magic: The Gathering)|The Brothers' War]]''': War between Urza and Mishra, two brothers who were trained by the archaeologist and artificer Tocasia in creating magical devices based on ancient Thran technology. As their powers grew, so did their enmity, eventually erupting in an all-out war utilizing powerful constructs. Marshalling vast armies aided by their impressive machines (some of the old Thran Empire, some newly made) the brothers staged a series of battles. The war devastated the land of Terisiare on the plane of Dominaria and culminated in a world-devastating climax on the island of Argoth. This caused the Dark, the climate changes which led to the Fall of the Sarpadian Empires and finally to the Ice Age. This story is the basis for the ''Antiquities'' expansion and later the ''Urza's Saga'' Block.
* '''[[The Dark (Magic: The Gathering)|The Dark]]'''  The devastation wrought by the Brothers led to the fall of many civilizations and the beginning of a Dark Age in Dominaria. The destruction of Argoth caused a [[nuclear winter]] that would later lead to the Dominarian Ice Age.  This story is portrayed in the ''Fallen Empires'' and ''The Dark'' expansions. In this age Terisiare's survivors were bitterly opposed to magic. Tiny, insular villages dotted a wasted, goblin-infested landscape. Fanatical priests controlled a few powerful city-states. Preachers and witch-hunters hunted the countryside for the few remaining wizards. Despite this oppression, it is during this era that mortal wizards first discover the five-color nature of magic. This story is fully explained in the novel ''The Gathering Dark'' by Jeff Grubb. The following Ice Age is detailed in ''Eternal Ice'' and ''The Shattered Alliance'', also by Jeff Grubb.
*'''[[Fallen Empires (Magic: The Gathering)|Fallen Empires]]''' The harsh climatic changes that followed the destruction of Argoth caused the southern continent, Sarpadia, to struggle for survival. The elves and humans of Sarpadia begin breeding primitive but adaptable subspecies: saprolings and thrulls, respectively. These creatures soon turn on their creators and terrorize the people of Sarpadia, while the Merfolk suffered an invasion of crustacean-like homarids, which benefitted from the cooling oceans. Barraged by invading orcs, goblins, homarids, thrulls, and even fungus, the civilizations of Sarpadia are destroyed, and the continent falls into darkness.
*'''[[Ice Age (Magic: The Gathering)|The Ice Age]]''':  The climate-altering effects of the devastation continued leading to a global ice age. New empires rose and fought in the cold. Eventually this cooling climate was reversed and life returned to normal.  This story is portrayed in the ''Ice Age'', ''Alliances'', and ''Coldsnap'' expansions, and in the novels ''Eternal Ice'' and ''Shattered Alliance'' by Jeff Grubb. Jeff Grubb also wrote a short story "continuing" the story for ''Coldsnap'', which is located in the Player's Guide insert you can find in a ''Coldsnap'' Fat Pack.
*'''[[Homelands (Magic: The Gathering)|The Homelands]]'''  This short interlude depicts the decimated plane of Ulgrotha, in which many civilizations struggle for power against Baron Sengir, a powerful vampire who has manipulated a number of other characters into serving his ends. The [[planeswalker]]s Serra and Feroz turn the balance in favor of the light, but are killed in battle against a crazed alien planeswalker. The story has no concrete ending.
*'''[[Mirage (Magic: The Gathering)|Jamuraa]]''': The story concerns three of the most powerful nations of [[Jamuraa]] (a tropical continent) — the militaristic kingdom of the Zhalfirins, the religious state of Femeref, and the trading province of the Suq'Ata empire. Zhalfir was the warrior nation, based mainly on red. Femeref was mainly white, and featured clerics and healers, while the seafaring traders of Suq'Ata were mostly blue. Mirage concerned these three nations and their struggle against the evil wizard Kaervek. Kaervek has imprisoned the powerful wizard and diplomat Mangara in an amber prison and the bulk of the story details the Jamuraans attempting to free Mangara. In addition to these events the [[planeswalker]] Teferi has caused his island to disappear from existence for almost 200 years. It is the phasing of the entire island that led Kaervek and Mangara to Jamuraa in the first place.
*'''The Phyrexian Invasion''':  After millennia of peace, the machine-like Phyrexians, who originate on a hellish mechanical world, invade the world of Dominaria led by the former Thran [[Yawgmoth]] from the [[pocket universe]] of Rath. The Phyrexian invasion divides in many sub-stories.
** '''[[Urza block|The Urza Saga]]''': Following the destruction of Argoth, Urza becomes a planeswalker and foresees the invasion of Dominaria. Urza's travels lead the war to the peaceful universe of Serra's realm which is destroyed by Phyrexian armies; survivors of the plane flee to Dominaria and Ulgrotha. In preparation for the invasion, Urza creates the Tolarian academy, a research and development laboratory-school in which he and other mighty wizards train mages for the upcoming invasion and  experiment on weaponry development, time-travel and genetic manipulation in hopes of creating a defensive army. The time experiments lead to a temporal collapse and the academy becomes laced with time fractures, which are both dangerous and useful to the inhabitants. Urza himself develops a fearful Legacy Weapon and Karn, a self-aware golem which, combined, can defeat any foe.  This story arc is linked to The Thran, Antiquities, The Dark, Ice Age and Homelands and is depicted in the books ''The Brothers War'', ''Planeswalker'' and ''Time Streams''.
** '''[[Rath block|The Legacy]]''': This follows the travels of many brave adventurers from all across Dominaria who, aboard Urza's vessel "The Weatherlight", seek to collect the different artifacts left by Urza and necessary to assemble the Legacy Weapon. Opposed to them, many Phyrexian allies or lords will try to stop them from their quest. This story arc is the longest in the Magic continuity, and its characters are depicted in the Weatherlight, Tempest, Stronghold, Exodus, Mercadian Masques, and Nemesis card sets; later, the story continues and concludes in the Invasion arc.
** '''[[Masques block|Prophecy]]''':  Parallel to the "Legacy" history, and following the Mirage and Urza's Saga histories, in Dominaria the warrior kingdom of Keld ensues war all across Jamuraa. Many wizards from the Tolarian academy aid the federation of Jamuraa and succeed in stopping the Keldons' warmongering.
** '''[[Invasion (Magic: The Gathering)|The Invasion]]''': The dreaded Phyrexians finally come to Dominaria across many "planar portals" and Urza, who has been spending thousands of years planning a defense against the Invasion, implements his plans. The Weatherlight leads the Dominarian forces, but the widespread chaos, and the uncompromising nature of Urza's tactics, threaten to destroy the plane. The arrival of Yawgmoth himself leads to the Apocalypse, but he is finally defeated by the fully assembled Legacy Weapon. The Invasion itself occurs in the ''Invasion'' block, but is linked to all previous story arcs. From this point on, the publishers switch to a series of self-contained plotlines with occasional links to older stories, rather than sweeping epics spanning years of card releases.
*'''[[Odyssey (Magic: The Gathering)|Odyssey]]''': One hundred years after the devastation of the Invasion, Dominaria is still in the process of rebuilding. This part of the story takes place in Otaria, a devastated continent that was, surprisingly, the place least affected by the Invasion. It centers on Kamahl, a barbarian, and his quest to get the Mirari, a magical orb of seemingly endless power.
**'''[[Onslaught (Magic: The Gathering)|Onslaught]]''': Having acquired the Mirari with devastating effects, Kamahl renounces it and tries to be rid of it, but the events he triggered have gone far beyond his control. The story shifts to a battle between Akroma, an angel, and Phage, Kamahl's corrupted sister, who kills with a touch. As zealous armies gather behind each of them, Kamahl needs to end their escalating conflict before Otaria itself is decimated. To this end, he recovers the slumbering Mirari and allies himself with three ancient gods who have been waiting for these events to happen again. This story is linked to Mirrodin, and sets the scene for the first major storyline not set on Dominaria.
*'''[[Mirrodin]]''':  The story of Mirrodin takes place on a new, metal world, created by the planeswalker Karn and populated by races stolen from other worlds. Glissa, an elf, and her allies strive to assemble the mythical Kaldra, so that they can defeat the crazed Memnarch, who lives inside the hollow world. All the while, we learn about the history of Mirrodin, and its loose, but nonetheless present, connection to previous storylines based on Dominaria. The Mirrodin story is the first of the new year-long, three-set story arcs, having started in 2003 with the release of ''Moons of Mirrodin'' and continuing with 2004's ''The Darksteel Eye'' and ''The Fifth Dawn''.
*'''[[Kamigawa|The Kami War]]''': The plane of Kamigawa is naturally divided in two: the kakuriyo Kami world (spirit world) and the utsushiyo material world; both working and operating harmoniously until the Kami began to attack the material world twenty years before the story opens. The books follow the lone [[samurai]] Toshiro Umezawa and the princess Michiko as they try to bring peace to Kamigawa. As well as giving the game an unusual, strong Oriental feel, this storyline is interesting in that the designers deliberately tried to give the story a strong influence over the game itself. Instead of relying on the traditional "color wheel" conflict (the game of Magic: the Gathering is based on a five-point circle of allied and enemy color affiliations), the color of any given card may often be less important than whether it has a Kami or Material theme.
*'''[[Ravnica]]''': Ravnica is a plane covered almost entirely in cityscape. The city's ten "guilds", political organizations each based on a different two-color mana pairing, warred for a long period of time. After the conflict, a magical document, the Guildpact, was created to ensure that the plane remained at peace and that the guilds would constrain themselves to their social roles. The main storyline begins 9,999 years later, as anticipation of the decimillennial anniversary builds. The once-noble guilds have corrupted and decayed over time, and a great political gridlock is all that keeps Ravnica stable. A series of protagonists - most notably Agrus Kos, a law enforcement officer from the Boros League, and Teysa Karlov, a lawmage from the Orzhov Syndicate, uncover the plots of the various guildmasters, as well as the ambitions of the "secret guild", House Dimir. The flavor of the cards again exerted considerable influence over the mechanics of the game, encouraging players to build decks devoted to a particular guild.
*'''[[Time Spiral (Magic: The Gathering)|Time Spiral]]''': The Time Spiral block returns to a post-apocalyptic Dominaria. Teferi, a planeswalker, abandoned Urza during the Phyrexian Invasion by "phasing" (temporarily removing from reality) two landmasses known as Shiv and Zhalfir out. He returns to Dominaria to find it in a state of ruin. In addition to having been almost totally devastated by the Apocalypse, mysterious "time rifts" have opened in the skies across the plane, making planeswalking and spellcasting more difficult. Teferi wants to ensure that Zhalfir and Shiv return to Dominaria safely - however, the time rifts, and the considerably deteriorated state of the plane itself, mean that the two continents no longer "fit." Should Zhalfir and Shiv land, Dominaria and the entire Multiverse would be destroyed. The Time Spiral block was billed as Magic's [[nostalgia]] block, and would revisit themes and characters from every storyline up to the end of the Otaria arc. As the Invasion did before, the Time Spiral story is linked to any other story arc before it, harkening back to many earlier settings and characters, even those outside of Dominaria.  It was during this block that The Mending occurred, greatly reducing the powers of all planeswalkers.
*'''[[Lorwyn]]''': Whereas most blocks consist of three sets, it was decided to turn the 2007/08 block into two mini blocks of two sets each. The focus of the first is the plane of Lorwyn, an idyllic, perpetually sunlit world populated by a wide variety of civilized species. These tribes are generally peaceful but keen to keep to themselves. The story centers around an elf outcast named Rhys who has triggered a series of events foreseen by his mentor, Colfenor, and a flamekin pilgrim named Ashling who believes her path and Rhys's are the same. The coming [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora]], an annual event when the plane darkens and lights appear in the sky, is the key to whatever it is that Rhys needs to do.
**'''[[Shadowmoor]]''': Rather than passing harmlessly as it normally does, the Aurora instead transforms Lorwyn into an eerie reflection of itself. The idyllic, sunlit world is replaced by the shadows and omnipresent malice of Shadowmoor. Landscapes, races and even individuals become twisted alternatives with no indication that their Lorwyn selves ever existed. Ashling, now known as the Extinguisher, has a central role in this shift, and it falls to Rhys (an elvish hero in this place) and Maralen, a mysterious elf and one of the very few unchanged by the transformation, to discover why.
*'''[[Alara block|Alara]]''': The plane of Alara was shattered long ago by an unknown force; it is now split unequally into five unique shards, each having no knowledge of the others. Each shard was denied two of the five colors of magic by the event (the inhabitants of each shard have had no recollection of the missing two colors of mana for centuries), and have evolved around their remaining three: The militant, feudal, sun-dappled plane of Bant; the scientific, order-obsessed, windy and cloud covered plane of Esper; the desperate, lifeless, blackened plane of Grixis; the violent, harsh, volcanic plane of Jund; and the green, lush, stampeding plane of Naya. Many species die off, evolve, or border extinction in each shard due to insufficient mana sustenance (Zombies can't survive without black mana, angels can't survive without white mana, etc.), and others thrived. The force that shattered the plane is unknown, but believed to be the five-headed hydra Progenitus (for unknown reasons) who disappears at the shattering of the plane and reappears in the expansion "Alara - Conflux" when the shards are reunited.
**'''Conflux''': As the Shards of Alara draw closer together, the millennia-long machinations of a hidden evil come closer to bearing a dire harvest. Nicol Bolas, once one of the most powerful planeswalkers, has been manipulating the civilizations of Alara for his own reasons. As the shards violently collide with each other after centuries apart, war erupts on all sides, and in the chaos, Bolas seeks to harness the power of the Maelstrom, the chaotic center of the plane where all five colors come together in a magical storm of unimaginable energies and power. The planeswalker Elspeth Tirel and the valiant knight Rafiq start to catch wind of an insidious plot and begin investigating.
*'''[[Zendikar]]''': A new plane is introduced: Zendikar, a world with powerful, uncontrollable mana and many dangerous features, including the Roil. Planeswalkers are drawn to Zendikar because of its powerful mana. Many of Zendikar's residents must fight against the land itself as mountains become alive and forests move. It is revealed that thousands of years ago three planeswalkers locked powerful, unstoppable beings known as the Eldrazi in a complex prison on Zendikar, causing the plane's complex problems. When three more planeswalkers enter the prison, the Eldrazi are released and start destroying Zendikar as they cannot escape from the plane.
*'''[[Scars of Mirrodin]]''': As the storyline returns to the metallic plane of Mirrodin, it is found divided.  A corrupted Karn has returned and brought with him the rot of Phyrexia.  As the world faces off, Mirran versus Phyrexian, the idyllic plane is brought to a new form.  This set also marked a deviation from the five color wheel, instead pushing players to align their decks to the Mirran or Phyrexian side of the conflict; to reenforce this, they created a web site devoted to the war where the player can switch between sides. In February 2011, it was announced that Phyrexia had won, and the set New Phyrexia played out as a war amongst five Praetors of Phyrexia, battling each other for dominance.
*'''[[Innistrad]]''': A new plane is introduced: Innistrad, set in a gothic-themed world, where vampires, werewolves, and demons run rampant. Before the events of the block, the human population of Innistrad was constantly beset by supernatural creatures. In response, the planeswalker Sorin created the arch-angel Avacyn to protect the humans. Avacyn set out to eradicate all of Innistrad's demons, leading to an epic battle against the elder demon, Griselbrand. During the battle, Griselbrand was able to trick Avacyn into locking both beings in the magical prison known as the Helvault. With Avacyn gone, the angel's protection disappeared and soon creatures of darkness were free to prey on mankind once more. When Sorin finds out about this he goes straight to Innistrad (presumably from Zendikar) to see what can be done. While he is searching for Avacyn, Liliana Vess is there searching for Griselbrand so she can slay him and release herself from their bargain for Liliana's soul. Liliana discovers the Hellvault and releases Griselbrand and Avacyn. Liliana slays Griselbrand, and Avacyn's restored powers guard humanity from the zombies, werewolves, and dangers of Innistrad.
*'''[[Return to Ravnica]]''': Returning to the megalopolis of Ravnica, the guilds have been in a state of constant warfare ever since the events of Dissension, when the Guildpact was dissolved. The Izzet League's guild leader Niv-Mizzet discovers a maze passing through the Tenth District of the city. He sets his entire guild on figuring out the point of this "Implicit Maze". It is learned later in the story that the being who traverses the maze will become the Ruler of Ravnica. Niv-Mizzet makes an announcement all over the city of Ravnica, asking all guilds to send a champion to run the maze. The planeswalker Jace Beleren solves the mystery of the maze and lauds himself the Living Guildpact, settling disputes for the ten guilds.
*'''[[Theros]]''': On a new plane, Theros, based on the heroes, myths, and monsters of [[Ancient Greece]], Elspeth arrives and is declared the Champion of the sun god, Heliod. The planeswalker Xenagos becomes the God of Revels, angering the established pantheon of the other Gods. Heliod gives Elspeth the Godsend, a sword with which to slay Xenagos. Ajani Goldmane, another planeswalker, helps Elspeth to kill Xenagos. Meanwhile, the planeswalker Kiora is searching the seas of Theros for something that will help to defeat the Eldrazi that will inevitably eventually destroy the Multiverse. The merfolk begin to worship Kiora, mistaking her for Thassa, the God of the Sea. At this point all of the Gods of Theros are very angry at the planeswalkers. After Elspeth kills Xenagos, Heliod takes the Godsend and kills Elspeth with it, sending Elspeth to the underworld of Theros. Ajani is angered and stays on Theros looking for a way to get even with the Gods.
*'''[[Khans of Tarkir]]''': A new plane (Tarkir) is the setting of this block. Tarkir is the homeworld of Sarkhan Vol, a planeswalker known for an obsession with dragons, and the five warring clans, each aligned towards 3 colours. The Mardu (RWB), The Abzan (WBG), The Jeskai (URW), The Sultai (BGU) and the Temur (GUR). All dragons have gone extinct on Tarkir, hunted to extinction by the 5 clans many years ago, but Sarkhan returns to find the source of the voice within his mind. The Planeswalker Sorin also comes to Tarkir where he discovers that Ugin, one of the Planeswalkers that helped to seal the Eldrazi on Zendikar, has died many years ago. Sorin leaves Tarkir saddened by this loss. With the help of the Jeskai leader Narset, Sarkhan makes his way to the resting place of Ugin and travels back in time through the Nexus (the remains of Ugin form this Nexus) but not before he sees Narset killed by Zurgo Helmsmasher, Khan of the Mardu.
**'''[[Fate Reforged]]''': Sarkhan travels through the Nexus 1000 years into the past and discovers the world of Tarkir before the fall of the Dragons. He discovers that the Dragons are formed within great tempests and that these tempests are powered by Ugin himself. He arrives in time to see Ugin confront his nemesis Nicol Bolas, Sarkhan's old master (although at this point in time Nicol Bolas had not met Sarkhan yet). Sarkhan sees Nicol Bolas kill Ugin and leave Tarkir, leaving Sarkhan distraught that he could not save the great Dragon. Using the power of the Hedron he had recovered from Zendikar, Sarkhan encases Ugin within a cocoon of Hedrons and seals him away to save his life. This act changes the future history of Tarkir, as with Ugin still alive the Dragon Tempests would never end, preventing the humans from hunting the Dragons into extinction. Due to his actions changing his own past, Sarkhan is pulled from the past Tarkir and back into the present.
**'''[[Dragons of Tarkir]]''': Sarkhan returns to the present day Tarkir to find the Dragons have survived and now live together with the humans. Although the 5 clans still clash among each other, they are now led by the powerful Dragon Lords instead of the human Khans of Sarkhan's own past. He sees many people he knew from his own timeline, however none of them remember him and all have changed as Sarkhan's actions have influenced this new Tarkir. Sarkhan travels again to the resting place of Ugin and discovers the revived Elder Dragon is gone. He cannot sense Ugin's power in his plane but takes refuge in the fact that Ugin is safe. Sarkhan then goes to find Narset where he discovers his old friend has now left the confines of the Dragons Clans and has learnt the secret history of Tarkir, including the history of Sarkhan himself. We also learn that Narset's spark has ignited and she has become a Planeswalker. We leave the pair on Tarkir, neither of them intending to leave for a long time, with too much to see and learn upon the reinvigorated plane of Tarkir.
*'''[[Battle for Zendikar]]''': The set picks up the storyline of Zendikar where the released Eldrazi devastate the plane. Ulamog, one of the 3 released Eldrazi titans, slowly consumes the land itself. The Zendikari population either flees or unites their strength to fight the Eldrazi together under the leadership of the planeswalker Gideon Jura. Gideon also convinces Jace on Ravnica to help Zendikar. Jace agrees, also since he is partly responsible for releasing the Eldrazi from their prison. He is convinced that the hedrons and leylines of the plane are the key to imprison the Eldrazi once again. The planeswalker Nissa with her unique connection to the plane itself and Kiora, with the weapon she stole from Thassa on Theros join the fight as well. With joint forces the Planeswalker and the Zendikari build a trap of aligned hedrons. For a moment they can imprison Ulamog again, but they were sabotaged by the reignited Demon Planeswalker Ob Nixilis who frees Ulamog, seeking revenge on Nissa and destruction of the plane he despises. He awakens Kozilek as well leaving the Plane with two ravaging Eldazi titans.
*'''[[Shadows over Innistrad]]''': The denizens of Innistrad are beset on all sides.  Their faith in the archangel Avacyn brought them strength when fighting against demons, werewolves, vampires, and all manners of horrors.  But, now the mighty protector of the plane has been twisted into something monstrous by an outside influence.  A very familiar force has stepped into the gothic world, and its corrupting tendrils now touch everything.  The next set, Eldritch Moon, focuses on the fact that Emrakul, the most powerful Eldrazi titan who had been missing from the Battle for Zendikar storyline, is now on Innistrad. Together, the Gatewatch must find a way to save the plane from Emrakul's influence. This story also focuses on cosmic horror instead of the traditional gothic horror of old Innistrad.
*'''[[Kaladesh]]''': The Gatewatch go to Chandra Nalaar's home world, the titular plane of Kaladesh, where she finds her mother (presumed dead) and almost kills Tezzeret. Tezzeret later kidnaps Rashmi, winner of the famous Inventor's Fair, and begins a dastardly plot to control the ruling Consulate. With the Consulate imprisoning inventors and confiscating their devices following the Fair, tensions between the populace and the government reach a boiling point, as depicted in Aether Revolt. The block focuses on a Steampunk aesthetic, with the steam replaced by the powerful material aether.
*'''[[Amonkhet]]''': The Gatewatch set out to destroy the evil dragon planeswalker Nicol Bolas after learning of his dominion over the titular desert plane Amonkhet. In the desert, they find a city (Naktamun) teeming with food, water, and life, ruled by five gods, with Bolas seemingly absent altogether. The people of Naktamun train their entire lives to die in ritual combat, hoping to experience pure bliss in the afterlife when the God-Pharaoh (Bolas) returns to Amonkhet. In Hour of Devastation, Bolas returns as prophesied, only to raze Naktamun and reveal the true purpose of the training and combat: to create an army of physically-perfect and combat-adept mummies to serve as an unquestionably loyal army. The block's setting is based ancient Egypt, with themes of social hierarchy and contrast between life and death.
*'''[[Ixalan]]''': The plane is home to four primary tribes, each with distinct synergies and advantages that draw off of one another.  As for the tale: the golden city of Orazca, bured deep in the jungle, houses a great secret.  The immortal sun, an artifact of immense power, is hidden there.  Now, that secret has become known.  The great forces of the plane gather to combat one another in a contest to see who will claim the mighty prize.  The merfolk River Herals, the vampiric Legion of Dusk, the Brazen Coalition of pirates, and the Sun Empire's dinosaur riders all meet in open conflict to decide the fate of their world.
*'''[[Dominaria]]''': A return to the place of so many of Magic: The Gathering's storylines in celebration of the game's 25th anniversary.

==Additional plots==
There are numerous other smaller plots and subplots that take place in Dominaria and on the many planes of the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] of '''Dominia''' as well as events after the invasion of Dominaria by the Phyrexians.

* The sets from ''Weatherlight'' up to ''Apocalypse'' follow the epic story arc of the crew of the airship ''Weatherlight'', their trek across several planes, and their ultimate role in defending Dominaria from the Phyrexian invasion.
* The sets from ''Odyssey'' to ''Scourge'', set in the era of upheaval after the Invasion, involve the Dominarian continent of Otaria and the struggle between various factions for the powerful artifact known as the Mirari.
* The sets from ''Mirrodin'' to ''Fifth Dawn'' are set in the world of Mirrodin, where artificial and natural life are inseparably entwined.
* Several [[Magic: The Gathering video games]] have their own storylines and worlds.
* Starting with The Mending during ''Time Spiral'', many of the stories revolve around the newly created, de-powered Planeswalkers. These characters recur in multiple sets, and may receive reprints or entirely new cards in new sets.

[[File:Jazzsoc.jpg|thumb|upright|Logo of the ''Oxford University Jazz Society'']]

The '''Oxford University Jazz Society''', also known as '''JazzSoc''', is the focus of [[jazz]] music at the [[University of Oxford]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ousu.org/organisation/7071/ | title=Oxford University Jazz Society | publisher=[[Oxford University Students' Union]] | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly known as the '''Oxford University Jazz Club''', the society now provides the main arena for student players to interact musically, whilst also encouraging a non-student contingent.

==History==
The music critic [[Peter Gammond]] (born 1925) was involved with the band that formed the original '''Oxford University Jazz Club'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Peter | last=Gammond | authorlink=Peter Gammond | title=One Man's Music | publisher=Wolfe | date=1971 | page=57 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conductor, composer, and pianist [[:de:Samuel Hogarth|Samuel Hogarth]] has studied the early history of the Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.samhogarth.net/about/ | title=About | first=Samuel | last=Hogarth | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the Club held meetings in St Michael's Hall every Saturday at 8&amp;nbsp;pm.{{fact|date=January 2017}} This consisted of two sessions of live Jazz presented by the Club's musicians, a record interlude, and often a recital by a guest soloist. In 1953, the club started to hold its meetings on alternate Fridays in the Green Room of the Kemp Restaurant where the Club's resident band would perform. The writer and documentary maker Tony Cash played clarinet and saxophone in the Club's band and became its President during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/about-college/tony-cash | title=Tony Cash | publisher=[[St Edmund Hall, Oxford]] | location=UK | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, there were two different [[jazz club]]s at the University: the larger ''Oxford University Jazz Club'', which met at the [[Carfax, Oxford|Carfax]] Assembly Rooms and had dancing, and the '''OU Modern Jazz Club''' which met in seated venues at the Wheatsheaf Inn on the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3632639/The-debates-that-yknow-drive-me-mad.html | title=The debates that, y'know, drive me mad | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=30 November 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by the saxophonist, clarinetist and composer [[Bill Ashton (jazz musician)|Bill Ashton]] (born 1936).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter=Ashton, 'Bill' William Michael Allingham | title=Who's Who of British Jazz | edition=2nd | editor-first=John | editor-last=Chilton | editorlink=John Chilton | publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] | date=2004 | page=11 | isbn=978-0826423894 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002 | editor-first=Andy | editor-last=Gregory | publisher=[[Psychology Press]] | date=2002 | page=18 | isbn=978-1857431612 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The columnist and bass player [[Miles Kington]], then a [[trombonist]], was a musical organiser of the Modern Jazz Club in Trinity Term 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=OU Modern Jazz Club Membership Card for Trinity Term 1963 |year=1963 | publisher=Oxford University | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; He refused membership of the Club to Nigel Tully, founder of the ''Dark Blues'' band,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.darkbluesmanagement.com/ | title=Dark Blues Management | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because of his love of [[Buddy Holly]]'s music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.countrylife.co.uk/country-pursuits/party-planning-41787 | title=Party Planning | journal=[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]] | location=UK | date=7 February 2007 | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Performers in the Michaelmas Term 1962 included Dickie Hawdon(trumpet), Alan and Jimmy Skidmore, and the Fat John Band.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=OU Modern Jazz Club Membership Card for Michaelmas Term 1962 |year=1962 | publisher=Oxford University | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the OU Jazz Club started the Big Night, initiated by Marcus Wigan on the OU Jazz Club Committee, and hired the entire [[Johnny Dankworth]] Big Band&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mwigan.com/mrw/OU_UK_and_Au_Community_and_Club_Roles.html | title=Oxford University Jazz Club | work=Community roles | publisher=wigan.com | first=Marcus | last=Wigan | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for what was a significant financial risk, but in the end turned out to be a successful event.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The controlled capacity of the Carfax Assembly Rooms was strictly observed, and counters were allocated to check people in and out of the dance and performance hall itself during the evening to maintain these numbers. To the regret of the organisers, with a good profit in a queue extending well back through Carfax, the University [[Proctor]]s arrived and stopped any more tickets being sold... nevertheless, the night was a financial success and became an annual institution for as long as the OU Jazz Club continued.This first Big Night was held on 4 February 1963. Shortly after Marcus Wigan presented a large cheque for the Big Night, [[John Dankworth]] gave a talk to the very different Modern Jazz Club (where Wigan was also on the Committee): the Pat Crumly Quartet, the [[Ronnie Ross]] plus Trio and [[Art Themen]] plus the Pat Crumly Quartet all presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=OU Modern Jazz Club Membership Card for the Hilary Term 1963 |year=1963 | publisher=Oxford University | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the OU Jazz Club organised weekly gigs in the first floor of the former Roebuck public house in [[Market Street, Oxford|Market Street]], central [[Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Robert | last=Nicholson | title=The Shell Weekend Guide to London and the South-East | publisher=R. Nicholson | date=1979 | page=160 | isbn=978-0905522128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; presenting well-known British jazz musicians such as [[Lol Coxhill]], [[Harry Beckett]], [[Alan Skidmore]], [[Don Rendell]], [[Art Themen]], [[Kenny Wheeler]] and [[Barbara Thompson (musician)|Barbara Thompson]] as well as Oxford-based jazz bands including Pat Crumly's 'Edge' and the [[Oxcentrics]].{{fact|date=January 2017}}

After a period of inactivity in the 1980s, in 1994, the OU Modern Jazz Club was reformed as the Jazz Society and is now colloquially known as "'''JazzSoc'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.jazzsoc.co.uk/ | title=JazzSoc | publisher=Oxford University | location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1994 and 1997, it hosted a weekly jam session at Po Na Na on [[St Giles', Oxford|St Giles']]; from 1997 to 2004 the session was once again at the Wheatsheaf pub on the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]], where the jam session regularly attracted an audience of up to 100 students.

In 2004, JazzSoc returned to its original home at the Roebuck, known until 2006 as the 'Market Tavern' (after then it was transformed into a '[[Wagamama]]' restaurant). From 2006 until 2008, JazzSoc took place at the 'Blue Bar' in the cellar of the Cock and Camel pub on [[George Street, Oxford|George Street]]. This has also since transformed into a restaurant and is now owned by [[Jamie Oliver]]. In 2008, the society briefly held its jams at the Purple Turtle bar, before having no fixed venue for a short period during which the jams were held in various college bars on various days, depending on availability. At the end of 2008 the jam eventually settled at the 'Thirst Lodge', before another change in 2009 to Bar Copa in [[George Street, Oxford|George Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.copaofoxford.co.uk/ | title=Bar Copa | location=Oxford, UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period the weekly event consisted of a set performed by a house band of student musicians before opening the stage for a jam. However, once a term JazzSoc presented a 'spectacular' featuring an internationally renowned jazz act, playing either with their own band or with a local rhythm section. Past spectaculars featured [[Nigel Hitchcock]], [[Soweto Kinch]], [[Julian Arguelles]], and [[Jim Mullen]].

As of October 2013, the jam ran every Tuesday night at The Mad Hatter.{{fact|date=January 2017}} At this time JazzSoc began to host professional acts several times a term, ending the termly 'spectacular' trend. In addition, student bands hosting the jam began to more often be established student ensembles rather than a house band.

==Events==
JazzSoc runs a weekly jam at The Mad Hatter on [[Iffley Road]], Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://groupspaces.com/jazzsoc/ | title=Oxford University Jazz Society | publisher=groupspaces.com | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The jam typically opens with a house band set featuring either an up-and-coming jazz ensemble, student or otherwise, or a more widely renowned professional artist. The floor is then opened to everyone and anyone with a desire to jam.

Notable performances have included Escape Hatch (Ivo Neame, Andrea Di Biase, Dave Hamblett), Adam Waldmann (of [[MOBO]] winning [[Kairos 4Tet]], Gareth Lockrane, [[David Newton (pianist)|David Newton]], [[Tina May]], the [[BBC Young Musician of the Year|BBC Young Jazz Musician of the Year]] 2014 winner Alex Bone,{{fact|date=January 2017}} and Nigel Price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| url=http://www.jazzjournal.co.uk/magazine/1106/ | title=Preview: Nigel Price hits the road | first=Bruce | last=Lindsay | journal=[[Jazz Journal]] | location=UK | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

JazzSoc primarily sends information about its events to its members via its Facebook page "JazzSoc – Oxford University"&lt;ref&gt;{{Facebook|OxfordUniversityJazzSociety}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its mailing list, hosted by the Oxford University IT services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jazzsoc/ | title=Oxford University Jazz Society | publisher=Oxford University | location=UK | accessdate=28 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taipei 101 14, Dec 06.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A Page One book retailer outlet at [[Taipei 101]], Taiwan.]]

'''Page One''' ({{zh|s=叶壹堂|p=Yèyī Táng}}) is a [[bookstore]] chain and publisher founded in [[Singapore]] by Mark Tan (陈家强), with locations in Singapore, [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Thailand]].  Traditionally focused on English language books, it has recently expanded into the Chinese language market. However the shops have been closed in Singapore in 2011, Taiwan in 2015 and Hong Kong in November, 2016.

==History==
Page One began in 1983, when a small shop stocking handpicked art and design books opened in a shopping mall in Singapore. The small shop accumulated a loyal following over the years and evolved into a brand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pageonegroup.com/|title=Page One Group|last=|first=|date=|website=Page One|publisher=Page One Group|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Page One has marked its presence with bookstores in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Singapore, the Page One bookstore is established at [[VivoCity]], the shopping mall touted to be the largest of its kind on the island.

While it began as a retail outfit, Page One has also expanded in the areas of book publishing and distribution over the years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In publishing, Page One builds its strength from the acquisition of rights and creation of original in-house titles, with a focus on art and design content. Page One Publishing also brought its created titles to the West by selling territorial rights. These titles have been translated into eleven different languages. As a distributor, Page One has established a strong network in Asia and the rest of the world.

==Controversies==  
The chain managed to obtain approval for opening outlets in mainland China in early 2010s, and started reducing the number of political books stocked. No books deemed to be on sensitive topics are sold inside the country, except Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=20160107guardianpull&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/07/hong-kong-bookshops-pull-politically-sensitive-titles-after-publishers-vanish|title=Hong Kong bookshops pull politically sensitive titles after publishers vanish|author=Ilaria Maria Sala|work=The Guardian|date=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances|disappearance of five people]] linked to an independent Hong Kong book publishing house, the chain removed these books from their store at Hong Kong airport. The company will stop selling these titles in Hong Kong once existing stocks have been exhausted, leading to criticisms from academics that this forced disappearance from bookshop shelves as a result of the case was blatant self-censorship.&lt;ref name=20160107guardianpull/&gt;

==Design==
Mark Tan and his brother, architect Kay Ngee Tan ({{zh|s=陈家毅}}), uniquely incorporated Southeast Asian art into their stores.  For instance in [[Taipei]], Vietnamese, Burmese and Thai etc., artworks were specially designed for the store, which customers could also purchase.

Southeast Asian clothworks decorate Page One stores and the decor is changed every season.  This design initiative brought about the rise of "giant"-sized bookstores in Asia.

[[File:Pastoral Landscape by Alvan Fisher, 1854.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Alvan Fisher]], ''Pastoral Landscape'', 1854]]

A '''pastoral''' lifestyle (see [[pastoralism]]) is that of shepherds [[herd]]ing livestock around open areas of [[Landscape|land]] according to [[season]]s and the changing availability of water and pasture. It lends its name to a [[genre]] of literature, art, and music that depicts such life in an idealized manner, typically for [[Urban culture|urban audiences]]. A ''pastoral'' is a work of this [[genre]], also known as '''bucolic''', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|βουκολικόν}}, from {{lang|grc|βουκόλος}}, meaning a [[Pastoral farming|cowherd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|boukoliko/s|βουκολικόν|ref}}. {{LSJ|bouko/los|βουκόλος|ref|mLSJ}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|bucolic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pastoral literature==

===Pastoral literature in general===
Pastoral is a [[Mode (literature)|mode]] of literature in which the author employs various techniques to place the complex life into a simple one.  Paul Alpers distinguishes pastoral as a mode rather than a genre, and he bases this distinction on the recurring attitude of power; that is to say that pastoral literature holds a humble perspective toward nature.  Thus, pastoral as a mode occurs in many types of literature (poetry, drama, etc.) as well as genres (most notably the pastoral elegy).

Terry Gifford, a prominent literary theorist, defines pastoral in three ways in his critical book ''Pastoral''. The first way emphasizes the historical literary perspective of the pastoral in which authors recognize and discuss life in the country and in particular the life of a shepherd.&lt;ref name = Gifford1-12&gt;{{cite book |last=Gifford |first=Terry |title=Pastoral |location=London; New York |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |series=The New Critical Idiom |isbn=0415147328 |pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is summed up by [[Leo Marx]] with the phrase "No shepherd, no pastoral."&lt;ref name="Gifford1-12"/&gt; The second type of the pastoral is literature that "describes the country with an implicit or explicit contrast to the urban."&lt;ref name="Gifford1-12"/&gt; The third type of pastoral depicts the country life with derogative classifications.&lt;ref name="Gifford1-12"/&gt;

[[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' presents a 'golden age' when people lived together  in harmony with nature. This [[Golden Age]] shows that even before [[Alexandria]], ancient Greeks had sentiments of an ideal pastoral life that they had already lost. This is the first example of literature that has pastoral sentiments and may have begun the pastoral tradition. [[Ovid's Metamorphoses]] is much like the ''Works and Days'' with the description of ages (golden, silver, brazen, iron and human) but with more ages to discuss and less emphasis on the gods and their punishments. In this artificially constructed world, nature acts as the main punisher. Another example of this perfect relationship between man and nature is evident in the encounter of a shepherd and a goatherd who meet in the pastures in [[Theocritus]]' poem ''Idylls 1''.
Traditionally, pastoral refers to the lives of herdsmen in a romanticized, exaggerated, but representative way.  In [[literature]], the adjective 'pastoral' refers to rural subjects and aspects of life in the countryside among [[shepherd]]s, [[Pastoral farming|cowherds]] and other farm workers that are often [[romanticism|romanticized]] and depicted in a highly unrealistic manner. The pastoral life is usually characterized as being closer to the [[Golden age]] than the rest of human life. The setting is a [[Locus Amoenus]], or a beautiful place in nature, sometimes connected with images of the [[Garden of Eden]].&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Ann Henish, ''The Medieval Calendar Year,'' p 96, {{ISBN|0-271-01904-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of the use of the genre is the short poem by the 15th-century [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[makar]] [[Robert Henryson]] ''[[Robene and Makyne]]'' which also contains the conflicted emotions often present in the genre. A more tranquil mood is set by [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s well known lines from ''[[The Passionate Shepherd to His Love]]'':

:''Come live with me and be my Love,''
:''And we will all the pleasures prove''
:''That hills and valleys, dale and field,''
:''And all the craggy mountains yield."

:''There will we sit upon the rocks''
:''And see the shepherds feed their flocks,''
:''By shallow rivers, to whose falls''
:''Melodious birds sing madrigals.''

"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love" exhibits the concept of Gifford's second definition of pastoral. The speaker of the poem, who is the titled shepherd, draws on the idealization of urban material pleasures to win over his love rather than resorting to the simplified pleasures of pastoral ideology. This can be seen in the listed items: "lined slippers," "purest gold," "silver dishes," and "ivory table" (lines 13, 15, 16, 21, 23). The speaker takes on a voyeuristic point of view with his love, and they are not directly interacting with the other true shepherds and nature.

Pastoral shepherds and maidens usually have [[Greek language|Greek]] names like [[Corydon (character)|Corydon]]  or Philomela, reflecting the origin of the pastoral genre. Pastoral poems are set in beautiful rural landscapes, the literary term for which is "locus amoenus" (Latin for "beautiful place"), such as [[Arcadia]], a rural region of [[Greece]], mythological home of the god [[Pan (god)|Pan]], which was portrayed as a sort of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] by the poets.  The tasks of their employment with sheep and other rustic chores is held in the fantasy to be almost wholly undemanding and is left in the background, abandoning the shepherdesses and their swains in a state of almost perfect [[leisure]].  This makes them available for embodying perpetual [[erotica|erotic]] fantasies.  The shepherds spend their time chasing pretty girls &amp;mdash; or, at least in the Greek and Roman versions, pretty lads as well.  The eroticism of [[Virgil]]'s second [[eclogue]], ''Formosum pastor Corydon ardebat Alexin'' ("The shepherd Corydon burned with passion for pretty Alexis") is entirely [[homosexual]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Goethe Yearbook|last=Richter|first=Simon|publisher=Camden House|year=2008|isbn=9781571133144|location=Suffolk|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Pastoral poetry===
[[File:Meister des Vergilius Romanus 001.jpg|thumb|210px|right|[[Georgics]] Book III, ''Shepherd with Flocks'', [[Vergil]] ([[Vatican Library]])]]
Pastoral literature continued after Hesiod with the [[poetry]] of the [[Hellenistic]] Greek [[Theocritus]], several of whose ''Idylls'' are set in the countryside (probably reflecting the landscape of the island of [[Kos|Cos]] where the poet lived) and involve dialogues between herdsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction (p.14) to Virgil: ''The Eclogues'' trans. Guy Lee (Penguin Classics)&lt;/ref&gt; Theocritus may have drawn on authentic folk traditions of Sicilian shepherds. He wrote in the [[Doric Greek|Doric dialect]] but the metre he chose was the [[dactylic hexameter]] associated with the most prestigious form of Greek poetry, [[Epic poetry|epic]]. This blend of simplicity and sophistication would play a major part in later pastoral verse. Theocritus was imitated by the Greek poets [[Bion of Smyrna|Bion]] and [[Moschus]].

The Roman poet [[Virgil]] adapted pastoral into Latin with his highly influential ''[[Eclogues]]''.  Virgil introduces two very important uses of pastoral, the contrast between urban and rural lifestyles and political allegory&lt;ref&gt;Article on "Bucolic poetry" in ''The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; most notably in Eclogues 1 and 4 respectively.  In doing so, Virgil presents a more idealized portrayal of the lives of shepherds while still employing the traditional pastoral conventions of Theocritus.  He was the first to set his poems in Arcadia, an idealized location to which much later pastoral literature will refer.

[[Horace]]'s The [[Epodes]], ii Country Joys has "the dreaming man" Alfius, who dreams of escaping his busy urban life for the peaceful country. But as "the dreaming man" indicates, this is just a dream for Alfius. He is too consumed in his career as a [[usurer]] to leave it behind for the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/HoraceEpodesAndCarmenSaeculare.htm#_Toc98670050 Horace's ''Delights of the Country'' Epode ii] Retrieved October 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Later [[Silver Latin]] poets who wrote pastoral poetry, modeled principally upon Virgil's Eclogues, include [[Titus Calpurnius Siculus|Calpurnius Siculus]] and [[Nemesianus]] and the author(s) of the [[Einsiedeln Eclogues]].

Italian poets revived the pastoral from the 14th century onwards, first in Latin (examples include works by [[Petrarch]], [[Pontano]] and [[Baptista Mantuanus|Mantuan]]) then in the Italian vernacular ([[Jacopo Sannazaro|Sannazaro]], [[Boiardo]]). The fashion for pastoral spread throughout Renaissance Europe. In Spain, [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]] was an important pioneer and his motifs find themselves renewed in the 20th-century Spanish-language poet [[Giannina Braschi]].  Leading French pastoral poets include [[Clément Marot|Marot]] and [[Pierre Ronsard|Ronsard]].
[[File:Blake shepherd.jpg|thumb|250px|left| [[Romanticism|Romantic]] artist, illustrator and poet William Blake's hand painted print illustrating his pastoral poem "[[The Shepherd (Blake)|The Shepherd]]" depicts the pastoral scene of a shepherd watching his flock with a shepherd's crook.

Essick, and Joseph Viscomi | publisher = [[William Blake Archive]]| accessdate = January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The first pastorals in English were the ''[[Eclogues]]'' (c. 1515) of [[Alexander Barclay]], which were heavily influenced by [[Mantuan]]. A landmark in English pastoral poetry was [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]’s ''[[The Shepheardes Calender]]'', first published in 1579. Spenser's work consists of twelve eclogues, one for each month of the year, and is written in dialect. It contains [[elegy|elegies]], [[fable]]s and a discussion of the role of poetry in contemporary England. Spenser and his friends appear under various pseudonyms (Spenser himself is "Colin Clout"). Spenser's example was imitated by such poets as [[Michael Drayton]] (''Idea, The Shepherd's Garland'') and [[William Browne (poet)|William Browne]] (''Britannia's Pastorals''). During this period of England's history, many authors explored "anti-pastoral" themes. Two examples of this is [[Sir Philip Sidney]]'s “The Twenty-Third Psalm” and “The Nightingale” focus on the world in a very anti-pastoral view. In “The Twenty-Third Psalm,” Nature is portrayed as something we need to be protected from, and in “The Nightingale,” the woe of [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]] is compared to the speaker's own pain. Additionally, he wrote ''[[The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia|Arcadia]]'' which is filled with pastoral descriptions of the landscape. "[[The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd]]" (1600) by [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] also comments on the anti-pastoral as the nymph responds realistically to the idealizing shepherd of ''[[The Passionate Shepherd to His Love]]'' by embracing and explaining the true course of nature and its incompatibility with the love that the Shepherd yearns for with the nymph.

In the 17th century came the arrival of the [[Country house poem]]. Included in this genre is [[Aemilia Lanyer]]’s ''The Description of Cooke-ham'' in 1611, in which a woman is described in terms of her relationship to her estate and how it mourns for her when she leaves it.  In 1616, [[Ben Jonson]] wrote ''To Penshurst,'' a poem in which he addresses the estate owned by the Sidney family and tells of its beauty. The basis of the poem is a harmonious and joyous elation of the memories that Jonson had at the manor. It is beautifully written with iambic pentameter, a style that Jonson so eloquently uses to describe the culture of Penshurst.  It is very important to note the insertion of Pan and Bacchus as notable company of the manor. Pan, Greek god of the Pastoral world, half man and half goat, was connected with both hunting and shepherds; [[Bacchus]] was the god of wine, intoxication and ritual madness.  This reference to Pan and Bacchus in a pastoral view demonstrates how prestigious Penshurst was, to be worthy in the company with gods, notions of just how romanticized the estate was.

"A Country Life", another 17th-century work by [[Katherine Philips]], was also a country house poem. Philips focuses on the joys of the countryside and looks upon the lifestyle that accompanies it as being  "the first and happiest life, when man enjoyed himself."  She writes about maintaining this lifestyle by living detached from material things, and by not over-concerning herself with the world around her.  [[Andrew Marvell]]'s "[[Upon Appleton House]]" was written when Marvell was working as a tutor for Lord Fairfax's daughter Mary, in 1651.  The poem is very rich with metaphors that relate to religion, politics and history.  Similar to Jonson's "To Penshurst", Marvell's poem is describing a pastoral estate.  It moves through the house itself, its history, the gardens, the meadows and other grounds, the woods, the river, his Pupil Mary, and the future.  Marvell used nature as a thread to weave together a poem centered around man.  We once again see nature fully providing for man.  Marvell also continuously compares nature to art and seems to point out that art can never accomplish on purpose what nature can achieve accidentally or spontaneously.

[[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]]'s ''The Hock-cart, or Harvest Home'' was also written in the 17th century. In this pastoral work, he paints the reader a colorful picture of the benefits reaped from hard work.  This is an atypical interpretation of the pastoral, given that there is a celebration of labor involved as opposed to central figures living in leisure and nature just taking its course independently.  This poem was mentioned in [[Raymond Williams]]', ''The Country and the City''.  This acknowledgment of Herrick's work is appropriate, as both Williams and Herrick accentuate the importance of labor in the pastoral lifestyle.

The [[pastoral elegy]] is a subgenre that uses pastoral elements to lament a death or loss. The most famous pastoral elegy in English is [[John Milton]]'s "[[Lycidas]]" (1637), written on the death of Edward King, a fellow student at Cambridge University. Milton used the form both to explore his vocation as a writer and to attack what he saw as the abuses of the Church. Also included is [[Thomas Gray]]'s, "Elegy on a Country Churchyard" (1750).

The formal English pastoral continued to flourish during the 18th century, eventually dying out at the end. One notable example of an 18th-century work is [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''Pastorals'' (1709). In this work Pope imitates [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''Shepheardes Calendar'', while utilizing classical names and allusions aligning him with [[Virgil]]. In 1717, Pope's ''Discourse on Pastoral Poetry'' was published as a preface to ''Pastorals.'' In this work Pope sets standards for pastoral literature and critiques many popular poets, one of whom is Spenser, along with his contemporary opponent Ambrose Phillips.  During this time period [[Ambrose Phillips]], who is often overlooked because of Pope, modeled his poetry after the Native English form of Pastoral, employing it as a medium to express the true nature and longing of Man.  He strove to write in this fashion to conform to what he thought was the original intent of Pastoral literature.  As such, he centered his themes around the simplistic life of the Shepherd, and, personified the relationship that humans once had with nature.  [[John Gay]], who came a little later was criticized for his poem's artificiality by [[Samuel Johnson|Doctor Johnson]] and attacked for their lack of realism by [[George Crabbe]], who attempted to give a true picture of rural life in his poem ''The Village.''

In 1590, Edmund Spenser also composed a very famous pastoral epic called ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', in which he employs the pastoral mode to accentuate the charm, lushness, and splendor of the poem's (super)natural world.  Spenser alludes to the pastoral continuously throughout the work and also uses it to create allegory in his poem, with the characters as well as with the environment, both of which are meant to have symbolic meaning in the real world.  It is composed of six books but Spenser intended to write twelve.  He wrote the poem primarily to honor [[Queen Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth]]. [[William Cowper]] addressed the artificiality of the fast-paced city life in his poems ''Retirement'' (1782) and ''The Winter Nosegay'' (1782). Pastoral nevertheless survived as a mood rather than a genre, as can be seen from such works as [[Matthew Arnold]]'s ''Thyrsis'' (1867), a lament on the death of his fellow poet [[Arthur Hugh Clough]]. [[Robert Burns]] can be read as a Pastoral poet for his nostalgic portrayals of rural Scotland and simple farm life in ''To A Mouse'' and ''The Cotter's Saturday Night''. Burns explicitly addresses the Pastoral form in his ''Poem on Pastoral Poetry''. In this he champions his fellow Scot [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsey]] as the best Pastoral poet since [[Theocritus]].

Another subgenre is the Edenic Pastoral, which alludes to the perfect relationship between God, man, and nature in the [[Garden of Eden]]. It typically includes biblical symbols and imagery. In 1645 John Milton wrote ''[[L'Allegro]]'', which translates as the happy person. It is a celebration of [[Gladness|Mirth]] personified, who is the child of love and revelry. It was originally composed to be a companion poem to, ''[[Il Penseroso]]'', which celebrates a life of melancholy and solitude. Milton's, ''[[On the Morning of Christ's Nativity]]'' (1629) blends Christian and pastoral imagery.

====Pastoral epic====
Milton is perhaps best known for his epic ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', one of the few Pastoral epics ever written. A notable part of Paradise Lost is book IV where he chronicles Satan’s trespass into paradise. Milton’s iconic descriptions of the garden are shadowed by the fact that we see it from Satan’s perspective and are thus led to commiserate with him. Milton elegantly works through a presentation of [[Adam and Eve]]’s pastorally idyllic, eternally fertile living conditions and focuses upon their stewardship of the garden. He gives much focus to the fruit bearing trees and Adam and Eve's care of them, sculpting an image of pastoral harmony. However, Milton in turn continually comes back to Satan, constructing him as a character the audience can easily identify with and perhaps even like. Milton creates Satan as character meant to destabilize the audience’s understanding of themselves and the world around them. Through this mode, Milton is able to create a working dialogue between the text and his audience about the ‘truths’ they hold for themselves.

===Pastoral romances===
Italian writers invented a new genre, the pastoral romance, which mixed pastoral poems with a fictional narrative in prose. Although there was no classical precedent for the form, it drew some inspiration from ancient Greek novels set in the countryside, such as ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]''. The most influential Italian example of the form was [[Sannazzaro]]'s ''Arcadia'' (1504). The vogue for the pastoral romance spread throughout Europe producing such notable works as [[Bernardim Ribeiro]] "Menina e Moça" (1554) in Portuguese,&lt;ref name=Warner&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Charles Dudley|title=A Library of the World's Best Literature - Ancient and Modern - Vol.XLIII|year=2008|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=1-60520-251-7|pages=456|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j6k3F_89oyEC&amp;lpg=PA456&amp;dq=bernardim%20ribeiro%20pastoral%20romance%20menina%20e%20mo%C3%A7a&amp;pg=PA456#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jorge de Montemayor|Montemayor]]'s [[Diana (pastoral romance)|''Diana'']] (1559) in Spain, [[Sir Philip Sidney]]'s ''Arcadia'' (1590) in England, and [[Honoré d'Urfé]]'s ''Astrée'' (1607–27) in France.

===Pastoral plays===
[[File:John Reinhard Weguelin – A Pastoral (1905).jpg|thumb|275px|&lt;center&gt;''A Pastoral'' (watercolour, 1905)&lt;br&gt;by [[John Reinhard Weguelin]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
Pastoral drama also emerged in Renaissance Italy. Again, there was little Classical precedent, with the possible exception of Greek [[satyr play]]s. [[Poliziano]]'s ''Orfeo'' (1480) shows the beginnings of the new form, but it reached its zenith in the late 16th century with [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]'s ''[[Aminta]]'' (1573), [[Isabella Andreini]]'s ''Mirtilla'' (1588), and [[Giambattista Guarini|Guarini]]'s ''Il pastor fido'' (1590). [[John Lyly]]'s ''Endimion'' (1579) brought the Italian-style pastoral play to England. [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''The Faithful Shepherdess'', [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''The Sad Shepherd''  and Sidney's ''[[The Lady of May]]'' are later examples. Some of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays contain pastoral elements, most notably ''[[As You Like It]]'' (whose plot was derived from [[Thomas Lodge]]'s pastoral romance ''Rosalynde'') and ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', of which Act 4 Scene 4 is a lengthy pastoral digression.

The forest in ''As You Like It'' can be seen as a place of pastoral idealization, where life is simpler and purer, and its inhabitants live more closely to each other, nature and God than their urban counterparts. However, Shakespeare plays with the bounds of pastoral idealization. Throughout the play, Shakespeare employs various characters to illustrate pastoralism. His protagonists [[Rosalind (As You Like It)|Rosalind]] and [[Orlando (As You Like It)|Orlando]] metaphorically depict the importance of the coexistence of realism and idealism, or urban and rural life. While Orlando is absorbed in the ideal, Rosalind serves as a mediator, bringing Orlando back down to reality and embracing the simplicity of pastoral love. She is the only character throughout the play who embraces and appreciates both the real and idealized life and manages to make the two ideas coexist. Therefore, Shakespeare explores city and country life as being appreciated through the coexistence of the two.

==Pastoral music==
Theocritus's ''Idylls'' include strophic songs and musical laments, and, as in [[Homer]], his shepherds often play the [[syrinx]], or [[Pan flute]], considered a quintessentially pastoral instrument. Virgil's ''Eclogues'' were performed as sung mime in the 1st century, and there is evidence of the pastoral song as a legitimate genre of classical times.

The pastoral genre was a significant influence in the development of [[opera]]. After settings of pastoral poetry in the [[pastourelle]] genre by the [[troubadour]]s, Italian poets and composers became increasingly drawn to the pastoral. Musical settings  of pastoral poetry became increasingly common in first polyphonic and then [[monodic]] [[madrigal]]s: these later led to the [[cantata]] and the [[serenata]], in which pastoral themes remained on a consistent basis. Partial musical settings of [[Giovanni Battista Guarini]]'s ''Il pastor fido'' were highly popular: the texts of over 500 madrigals were taken from this one play alone. [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]'s ''Aminta'' was also a favourite. As [[opera]] developed, the dramatic pastoral came to the fore with such works as [[Jacopo Peri]]'s ''[[Dafne]]'' and, most notably, [[Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo]]''. Pastoral opera remained popular throughout the 17th-century, and not just in Italy, as is shown by the French genre of ''[[pastorale héroïque]]'', Englishman [[Henry Lawes]]'s music for [[John Milton|Milton's]] ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' (not to mention [[John Blow]]'s ''[[Venus and Adonis (opera)|Venus and Adonis]]''), and Spanish [[zarzuela]]. At the same time, Italian and German composers developed a genre of vocal and instrumental pastorals, distinguished by certain stylistic features, associated with Christmas Eve.

The pastoral, and parodies of the pastoral, continued to play an important role in musical history throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. [[John Gay]] may have satirized the pastoral in ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', but also wrote an entirely sincere libretto for [[Handel]]'s ''[[Acis and Galatea (Handel)|Acis and Galatea]]''. [[Rousseau]]'s ''[[Le Devin du village]]'' draws on pastoral roots, and [[Metastasio]]'s libretto ''[[Il re pastore]]'' was set over 30 times, most famously by [[Mozart]]. [[Rameau]] was an outstanding exponent of French pastoral opera.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Cuthbert Girdlestone]], ''Jean-Philippe Rameau: His Life and Work'', particularly p.377 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beethoven]] also wrote his famous [[Pastoral Symphony]], avoiding his usual musical dynamism in favour of relatively slow rhythms. More concerned with psychology than description, he labelled the work "more the expression of feeling than [realistic] painting". The pastoral also appeared as a feature of [[grand opera]], most particularly in Meyerbeer's operas: often composers would develop a pastoral-themed "oasis", usually in the centre of their work. Notable examples include the shepherd's "alte Weise" from [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', or the pastoral ballet occupying the middle of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]''. The 20th-century continued to bring new pastoral interpretations, particularly in ballet, such as Ravel's ''Daphis and Chloe'', Nijinsky's use of Debussy's ''[[Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune]]'', and [[Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Le sacre du printemps]]'' and ''Les Noces''.&lt;ref&gt;General reference for this section: [[Geoffrey Chew (musicologist)|Geoffrey Chew]] and Owen Jander (2001).

The [[Pastorale]] is a form of [[Italian folk music|Italian folk song]] still played in the regions of Southern Italy where the [[zampogna]] continues to thrive. They generally sound like a slowed down version of a [[tarantella]], as they encompass many of the same melodic phrases. The pastorale on the zampogna can be played by a solo zampogna player, or in some regions can be accompanied by the piffero (also commonly called a [[ciaramella]], 'pipita', or [[bifora]]), which is a primitive key-less double reed [[oboe]] type instrument.

==Pastoral art==
{{main|commons:Category:Shepherds in art}}
Idealised pastoral landscapes appear in Hellenistic and Roman wall paintings. Interest in the pastoral as a subject for art revived in Renaissance Italy, partly inspired by the descriptions of pictures Sannazzaro included in his ''Arcadia''. The ''Fête champêtre'' (''Pastoral Symphony'') attributed to [[Giorgione]] is perhaps the most famous painting in this style. Later, French artists were also attracted to the pastoral, notably [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]], [[Poussin]] (e.g. [[Et in Arcadia ego]]) and [[Watteau]] (in his ''Fêtes galantes'').&lt;ref&gt;Article on "Pastoral" in ''The Oxford Companion to Art'' (ed. H. Osborne)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Cole]] has a series of paintings titled ''[[The Course of Empire (paintings)|The Course of Empire]]'', and the second of these paintings (shown on the right) depicts the perfect pastoral setting.

==Pastoral theory==
In the past four hundred years, a range of writers have worked on theorizing the nature of pastoral.  These include [[Friedrich Schiller]],&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Schiller, ''On Naive and Sentimental Poetry'' (1795).&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Puttenham]],&lt;ref name="English Poesie 1589"&gt;[[George Puttenham]], ''Arte of English Poesie'' (1589).&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Empson]],&lt;ref&gt;William Empson, ''Some Versions of Pastoral.'' (1935).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Kermode]],&lt;ref&gt;Frank Kermode, ''English Pastoral Poetry: From the Beginnings to Marvell.'' (1952).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Raymond Williams]],&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Williams, ''The Country and the City.'' Oxford U P, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renato Poggioli]],&lt;ref&gt;Renato Poggioli, ''The Oaten Flute: Essays on Pastoral Poetry and the Pastoral Ideal.'' Harvard U P, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;  Annabel Patterson,&lt;ref&gt;Annabel Patterson. ''Pastoral and ideology : Virgil to Valéry.'' U of California P, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Alpers,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Alpers, ''What is Pastoral?'' U of Chicago P, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ken Hiltner.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Hiltner, ''What Else is Pastoral?: Renaissance Literature and the Environment.'' Cornell U P, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Puttenham]] was one of the first Pastoral theorists. He did not see the form as merely a recording of a prior rustic way of life but a guise for political discourse, which other forms had previously neglected. The Pastoral, he writes, has a didactic duty to “contain and enforme morall discipline for the amendment of mans behaviour”.&lt;ref name="English Poesie 1589"/&gt;

[[Friedrich Schiller]] linked the Pastoral to childhood and a childlike simplicity. For Schiller, we perceive in nature an “image of our infancy irrevocably past”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://schillerinstitute.org/transl/Schiller_essays/naive_sentimental-1.html|title = On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry|last = Schiller|first = Friedrich|website = The Schiller Institute|publisher = Translated by William F. Wertz, Jr|access-date = March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir William Empson]] spoke of the ideal of Pastoral as being embedded in varying degrees of ambivalence, and yet, for all the apparent dichotomies, and contradicting elements found within it, he felt there was a unified harmony within it. He refers to the pastoral process as 'putting the complex into the simple.' Empson argues that "...&amp;nbsp;good proletarian art is usually Covert Pastoral", and uses Soviet Russia's propaganda about the working class as evidence.  Empson also emphasizes the importance of the double plot as a tool for writers to discuss a controversial topic without repercussions.

[[Raymond Williams]] argues that the foundation of the pastoral lies in the idea that the city is a highly urban, industrialized center that has removed us from the peaceful life we once had in the countryside. However, he states that this is really a "myth functioning as a memory" that literature has created in its representations of the past. As a result, when society evolves and looks back to these representations, it considers its own present as the decline of the simple life of the past. He then discusses how the city's relationship with the country affected the economic and social aspects of the countryside. As the economy became a bigger part of society, many country new-comers quickly realized the potential and monetary value that lay in the untouched land. Furthermore, this new system encouraged a social stratification in the countryside.  With the implementation of paper money came a hierarchy in the working system, as well as the "inheritance of titles and making of family names".

[[Renato Poggioli|Poggioli]] was concerned with how death reconciled itself with the pastoral, and thus came up with a loose categorization of death in the pastoral as 'funeral elegy', the most important tropes of which he cites as religion (embodied by Pan); friendship; allegory;and poetic and musical calling. He concedes though that such a categorization is open to much misinterpretation. As well, Poggioli focused on the idea that Pastoral was a nostalgic and childish way of seeing the world. In ''[[The Oaten Flue]]'', he claims that the shepherd was looked up to was because they were “an ideal kind of leisure class."

[[Frank Kermode]] discusses the pastoral within the historical context of the English Renaissance.  His first condition of pastoral poetry is that it is an urban product. Kermode establishes that the pastoral is derived as an opposition between two modes of living, in the country and in the city. London was becoming a modern metropolis before the eyes of its citizens. The result of this large-scale urban sprawl left the people with a sense of nostalgia for their country way of living.  His next argument focuses on the artificiality of poetry, drawing upon fellow theorist, Puttenham. Kermode elaborates on this and says, "the cultivated, in their artificial way, reflect upon and describe, for their own ends, the natural life". Kermode wants us to understand that the recreation or reproduction of the natural is in itself artificial. Kermode elaborates on this in terms of imitation, describing it  as "one of the fundamental laws of literary history" because it "gives literary history a meaning in terms of itself, and provides the channels of literary tradition". Kermode goes on to explain about the works of Virgil and Theocritus as progenitors of the pastoral. Later poets would draw on these earlier forms of pastoral, elaborating on them to fit their own social context. As the pastoral was becoming more modern, it shifted into the form of Pastourelle.  This is the first time that the pastoral really deals with the subject of love.

Annabel Patterson emphasizes many important ideas in her work, Pastoral and Ideology. One of these is that the pastoral mode, especially in the later 18th century, was interpreted in vastly different ways by different groups of people. As a result, distinctive illustrations emerged from these groups which were all variations of the understanding of Virgil’s Eclogues. Patterson explains that Servius' Commentary is essential to understanding the reception of Virgil's Eclogues. The commentary discusses how poets used analogy in their writings to indirectly express the corruption within the church and government to the public. When speaking of post-Romanticism, it is imperative to take into consideration the influence and effect of [[Robert Frost]] on pastoral ideology. His poem, ''Build Soil'' is a critique of war and also a suggestion that pastoral, as a literary mode, should not place emphasis on social and political issues, but should rather, as Patterson says, "turn in upon itself, and replace reformist instincts with personal growth and regeneration". [[William Wordsworth]] was a highly respected poet in the 1800s and his poem, ''Prelude,'' published in 1805, was an excellent example of what a dream of a new golden age might materialize as or look like.

Paul Alpers, in his 1996 book, ''What is Pastoral?'', describes the recurring plot of pastoral literature as the lives of shepherds.  With William Empson's notion of placing the complex into the simple, Alpers thus critically defines pastoral as a means of allegory.  Alpers also classifies pastoral as a mode of literature, as opposed to a genre, and he defines the attitude of pastoral works maintaining a humble relationship with nature.  Alpers also defines pastoral convention as the act of bringing together, and authors use this to discuss loss. He says the speakers in pastoral works are simple herdsmen dramatized in pastoral encounters.  However, authors like Herrick changed the herdsmen to nymphs, maidens, and flowers. Thus, achieving a mode of simplicity but also giving objects voice. This is done by personifying objects like flowers.  Moreover, authors that do this in their works are giving importance to the unimportant. Alpers talks about pastoral lyrics and love poems in particular. He says "a lyric allows its speaker to slip in and out of pastoral guise and reveal directly the sophistication which prompted him to assume it in the first place″. In other words, he claims pastorals lyrics have both pastoral and not pastoral characteristics, perhaps like in the comparisons between urban and rural, but they always give importance to and enhance on the pastoral. Alpers talks about love poems and how they can be turned into pastoral poems simply by changing words like lover to shepherd.  And he mentions Shakespeare as one of the authors who did this in his works. Furthermore, Alpers says the pastoral is not only about praise for the rural and the country side. For instance, Sidney dispraises the country life in ''The Garden''.  Pastoral can also include the urban, the court, and the social like in ''L’Allegro''. Alpers says that pastoral narration contradicts “normal” narrative motives and that there is a double aspect of pastoral narration: heroic poetry and worldly realities with narrative motives and conventions. And in respect to pastoral novels, Alpers says pastoral novels have different definitions and examples depending on the reader. Also, the pastoral novel differs from Theocritus and Virgil’s works. He says there are pastoral novels of the country life, of the longing for the simple, and with nature as the protagonist. And says the literary category of pastoral novels is realistic and post-realistic fiction with a rural theme or subject based on traditional pastoral.

In ''What Else Is Pastoral?'', Ken Hiltner argues that Renaissance pastoral poetry is more often a form of nature writing than critics like Paul Alpers and Annabel Patterson give it credit for. He explains that even though there is a general lack of lavish description in Renaissance Pastoral, this is because they were beginning to use gestural strategies, and artists begin to develop an environmental consciousness as nature around them becomes endangered. Another argument presented in the book is that our current environmental crisis clearly has its roots in the Renaissance. To do this we are shown examples in Renaissance pastoral poetry that show a keen awareness of the urban sprawl of London contrasted to the countryside and historical records showing that many at the time were aware of the issue of urban growth and attempted to stop it.

==Life==
Peter Trawny studied philosophy, [[musicology]] and [[art history]] at the [[Ruhr University]] Bochum, where he, after a guest stay at the [[Albert Ludwigs University]] in [[Freiburg]] in [[Breisgau]] and at the [[University of Basel]], the Magisterium graduated in 1992. In 1995, he received his doctorate at Klaus Held with a dissertation on [[Martin Heidegger]]'s [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of the world. With a doctoral scholarship from the Study Foundation of the German people, he was promoted and awarded in 1997 with the Second Prize of all faculties of the University of Wuppertal. This was followed by a two-month stay at the [[University of Kyoto]] in Japan with a grant from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. Starting in 1997, Trawny was a research assistant at the University of Wuppertal in Klaus Held's department of phenomenology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo22228791.html |title=Heidegger and the Myth of a Jewish World Conspiracy |publisher=uchicago.edu |accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 he completed his habilitation at the University of Wuppertal about the time of the Trinity. Studies on the Trinity in [[Hegel]] and [[Schelling]]. Sponsored by the Fritz Thyssen Foundation, after his habilitation he worked from 2001 to 2003 at the philosophy department of the Freiburg Albert Ludwigs University. In 2005, the German Literature Archive in [[Marbach on Neckar]] granted Trawny a full scholarship and honored him in 2006 with the Ernst Jünger grant from the State of Baden-Wuerttemberg. In the same year he was appointed associate professor of philosophy at the University of Wuppertal. 2009 brought Trawny a W3 professorship at the University of Wuppertal for aesthetics and philosophy of culture. In 2011 he assumed a deputy professor at the [[Södertörns Högskola]] in [[Stockholm]] at the Center for Baltic and East European Studies. In 2012 Trawny founded the Martin Heidegger Institut in German at the Bergische Universität in Wuppertal, for whose support he would win, among others, the legacy of Heidegger.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philosophie.uni-wuppertal.de/home/forschung/institute-und-zentren.html#c10940 (Stand: 24. Januar 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wz-newsline.de/lokales/wuppertal/einmalig-neues-uni-institut-erforscht-heideggers-lehren-1.1211804&lt;/ref&gt;

Trawny taught in addition to his international lecturing and research as a Visiting Professor at several international universities such as the [[University of Vienna]], the [[Tongji University]] in [[Shanghai]] or Södertörns Högskola in Stockholm at the Center for Baltic and East European Studies.

==Scientific work==
Trawnys approach to philosophical problems uses a phenomenological-hermeneutic method. The focus of his work are questions of political philosophy, ethics, art and media philosophy, as well as questions of art and literature.&lt;ref name="NewYorker"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/is-heidegger-contaminated-by-nazism |title=Is Heidegger Contaminated by Nazism? |date=April 28, 2014 |publisher=newyorker.com |accessdate=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his most recent works, Trawny dedicated to the elaboration of a philosophical understanding of globalization and cosmopolitanism, which in itself Adyton suggests, and especially in medium and Revolution clearly differentiated. Trawny tries to interpret the globalization of their strained relationship with the media and thus comes to a determination of the medium as "the immaterial unity of technology and capital". On the basis of Heidegger's event thinking tries Trawny the Marxist revolution discourse in the historical-contextual conditions of the 21st Century to translate, thus intertwined with those of its designation of the medium, the questions of political philosophy and media art philosophy.&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;

In addition to his research and teaching, Trawny is consistently involved in the scholarly edition of Martin Heidegger's collected works.&lt;ref name="NewYorker"/&gt;

'''Precita Eyes Muralists Association''' is a community-based [[non-profit]] [[muralist]] and [[Visual arts education|arts education]] group located in [[Mission District, San Francisco, California|the Mission District]] of [[San Francisco, California]], founded in 1977 by [[Susan Cervantes|Susan]] and Luis Cervantes.&lt;ref name="eyes"&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/17/DDB9SQCP0.DTL Precita Eyes celebrates two decades of making walls, and community, bloom], by Will Cain, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', October 17, 2007, access date July 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Precita Eyes Muralists Association was founded in 1977 by Susan and Luis Cervantes who had come to the Bay Area several years before and started a family. Susan Cervantes herself had been inspired by “[[Mujeres Muralistas|Las Mujeres Muralistas]],” the first all-women group of collaborative muralists from which she applies her strategy of collaborative, accessible, community art.&lt;ref name="eyes"/&gt;

[[File:El Hijo del Sol.jpg|thumb|right|By Precita Eyes Muralists Youth Mural Workshop, 2003]]

The organization evolved from a community mural workshop in which the participants designed and painted the portable mural “Masks of God, Soul of Man” for the Bernal Heights Library.&lt;ref name="goldengate-iconic"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://goldengatexpress.org/2013/03/14/mission-murals/|title = Muralist Community Provides Tours of Iconic SF Art|last = González|first = Guadalupe|date = March 14, 2013|work = Golden Gate Xpress|access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group signed the piece as Precita Eyes Muralists because the project was a collaborative effort. The name of the organization comes from the fact that most of the muralists were from Precita Valley. Precita is a diminutive form of the Spanish word ‘presa,’ which means dam; the word ‘Precita’ means little dam. The ‘Eyes’ in the name are what we perceive the visual world with, our own eyes.

After the first mural, the group of artists continued to be interested in creating murals. They completed two major mural commissions and several more portable murals. Two years later, the group applied for non-profit status in 1979. In 1998 Precita Eyes expanded its operations with the purchase of the building at 2981 24th Street, near the well-known [[Balmy Alley]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;Precita Eyes Muralists, Precita Eyes Organizational History, Press kit. Retrieved on March 03, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, Precita Eyes had supported nearly 100 murals in the Mission neighborhood,&lt;ref name="nytimes-gallery"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/28/arts/artsspecial/28mural.html?_r=0|title = A Neighborhood Is a Gallery, Its Brick Walls Canvases|last = Villano|first = Matt|date = March 28, 2007|work = New York Times|access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including on [[The Women's Building]] and Cesar Chavez Elementary School.&lt;ref name="indybay-beauty"/&gt;

Other recent local projects involved the restoration of two San Francisco Parks, Excelsior Playground and Crocker-Amazon Playground. They also host an annual Urban Youth Arts Festival, with artists painting on boards in Precita Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Fitzgerald Rodriguez |first= Joe |date= July 22, 2014 |title= Graffiti artists tagging in the sunshine at Precita Park |url= http://www.sfbg.com/pixel_vision/2014/07/22/photo-gallery-graffiti-artists-tagging-sunshine-precita-park |newspaper= San Francisco Bay Guardian |location= |access-date= March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murals are an expression of the culture of the neighborhood; in an article about Precita Eyes, muralist Juana Alicia Montoya said "In the 1960s and '70s, the Mission District became the cultural heart of the Chicano movement in California...And the murals were an integral part of that movement, as was theater and poetry."&lt;ref name="sfgate-art"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/MISSION-Celebrating-art-that-draws-people-2349295.php |title = Celebrating art that draws people together|last = Tyche Hendricks|first = Tyche|date = May 6, 2005|work = SFGate |access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Chicana and Chicano Art: ProtestArte'' says "Arts organizations such as Precita Eyes continue to support Chicano muralism's original objective: to create public art that authentically represents a community's history and culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jackson |first= Carlos Francisco |date= 2009 |title= Chicana and Chicano Art: ProtestArte |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2XfaMxFIyo0C&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;ots=HIpiB-iP4g&amp;dq=precita%20eyes%20art%20classes%20youth&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= University of Arizona Press |page= 81 |isbn= 9780816526475 |access-date= March 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

Precita Eyes Muralists is one of only a handful of mural arts organizations in the United States.&lt;ref name="sfweekly-tourism"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2014/06/13/tourism-for-locals-precita-eyes-paints-the-city-pretty|title = Tourism For Locals: Precita Eyes Paints the City Pretty|last = De Anda|first = Juan|date = June 13, 2014|work = SF Weekly|access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains two centers. The original Mural Arts Center at 348 Precita Avenue is used primarily by the education program for toddler, kids and youth classes. The Precita Eyes Mural Arts and Visitors Center, at 2981 24th Street, conducts mural tours; has a small art supply and mural merchandise store; is used as a gallery space and a space for workshops for adults to plan and design mural art; has space to work on mosaics and portable murals; and contains Precita Eyes Muralists’ Offices.

Precita Eyes Muralists offers weekly art classes for toddlers, children and youth 18 months to 19 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/precita-eyes-covers-mcdonalds-in-paint.html |title= Precita Eyes covers McDonald's in Paint |last1= Casey |first1= Cindy |last2= |first2= |date= March 25, 2013 |website= Art and Architecture - San Francisco |publisher= |access-date= March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs enable students to find and develop their confidence and individuality through arts and crafts, and experience positive social interaction through collaboration in a safe environment. It also offers regular workshops for adults such as the Community Mural Arts Education Workshop. Overall the educational programs serve approximately 3,000 children, youth and adults yearly, most of whom qualify as moderate to low income. People served by the program include young people caught for doing graffiti and required to do community service hours.&lt;ref name="indybay-beauty"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2006/08/24/18300401.php|title = Beauty on the Bricks: Precita Eyes Creates Murals and Artists|last = O'Donoghue|first = Liam|date = August 24, 2006|work = Fault Lines|access-date = March 7, 2015|publisher = San Francisco Bay Area Independent Media Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung: The Work of a Legendary Critic: Rock 'n' Roll as Literature and Literature as Rock 'n' Roll''''' is a collection of essays written by famous rock music critic [[Lester Bangs]]. Named for a 1971 article of the same title, it was edited by [[Greil Marcus]] and released in 1987, five years after Bangs' death. In his introduction, Marcus explains that, "Perhaps what this book demands from a reader is a willingness to accept that the best writer in America could write almost nothing but record reviews."

The book consists mainly of Bangs' published articles, beginning with his early work for ''[[Creem]]'' magazine before moving into his later writings as a freelancer for ''[[New Musical Express]]'' and other publications. Many of his most famous works are present, including the title piece on garage rock band the [[Count Five]] and the [[Troggs]]-inspired "James Taylor Marked for Death" from his earlier career as well as an acclaimed profile of [[the Clash]] and a tribute to [[Van Morrison]]'s album ''[[Astral Weeks]]'' from his later years. One chapter of the book is devoted entirely to Bangs' infamous series of interviews with [[Lou Reed]], including "[[Let Us Now Praise Famous Death Dwarves]]," while another chapter features unpublished essays and an unfinished novel excerpt, "Maggie May".

[[File:Mildenhall treasure great dish british museum.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|The Great Dish, or Great Plate of Bacchus, from the Roman [[Mildenhall Treasure]]]]

'''''Repoussé''''' or '''''repoussage''''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁəpuse|-|fr-repoussé.ogg}}; {{IPA-fr|ʁəpusaʒ||fr-repoussage.ogg}} respectively) is a [[metalworking]] technique in which a [[malleable]] [[metal]] is ornamented or shaped by [[hammer]]ing from the reverse side to create a design in [[low relief]]. It is a form of [[toreutics]].

There are few techniques that offer such diversity of expression while still being relatively economical. ''Chasing'' is the opposite of repoussé, and the two are used in conjunction to create a finished piece. It is also known as ''embossing''.

While ''repoussé'' is used to work on the reverse of the metal to form a raised design on the front, chasing is used to refine the design on the front of the work by sinking the metal. The term chasing is derived from the noun "chase", which refers to a groove, furrow, channel, or indentation. The adjectival form is "chased work".

The techniques of repoussé and chasing use the [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] of metal, forming shapes by degrees. There is no loss of metal in the process as it is stretched locally and the surface remains continuous. The process is relatively slow but a maximum of form is achieved, with one continuous surface of sheet metal of essentially the same thickness. Direct contact of the tools used is usually visible in the result, a condition not always apparent in other techniques, where all evidence of the working method is eliminated.

==Etymology==
The word ''repoussé'' is [[French language|French]] and means "pushed up", ultimately from {{lang-la|pulsare}}, which means "to push". Repoussage is the [[noun]] to refer to the technique, with ''repoussé'' being an [[adjective]] referring to a piece to which the technique has been applied (e.g. "''repoussé'' work", "''repoussé'' piece"). Chasing comes from the French word, ''chasser'' meaning to drive out, or to chase around which is what the artists are doing as they "chase" the forms on their metal in order to create their final design.

An example from antiquity is the late [[Eighteenth Dynasty]] mummy mask of [[Tutankhamun]]. The lapis lazuli and other stones were inlaid in chased areas after the height of the form was completed. The majority of the mask was formed using the technique of repoussé from what appears to be a single sheet of gold (the ceremonial beard, [[Nekhbet]] vulture, and [[Uraeus]] were attached separately). The [[Warren Cup]] is a Roman silver cup, and the [[Mildenhall Treasure]], the [[Hoxne Hoard]], the [[Water Newton Treasure]] and the [[Berthouville Treasure]] are examples of [[hoard]]s of Roman silver found in [[England]] and northern [[France]] with many pieces using these techniques. The prehistoric [[Gundestrup cauldron]] has [[relief]] panels on separate thin sheets on both the inside and outside.

The largest known [[sculpture]] created with this technique is the [[Statue of Liberty]], properly ''Liberté éclairant le monde,'' which translates as ''"Liberty Enlightening The World",'' in [[Upper New York Bay]]. The statue was formed by [[copper]] repoussé in sections using wooden structures to shape each piece during the  hammering process. A second example of monumental [[copper]] repoussé sculpture is [[Portlandia (statue)|''Portlandia'']] by [[Raymond Kaskey]], which was installed in 1985 in downtown [[Portland, Oregon]].

== History ==
[[Image:16th Century Tibet repousse.jpg|thumb|Gilt copper repoussé from Tibet, 16th century]]
The techniques of repoussé date from Antiquity and have been used widely with [[gold]] and [[silver]] for fine detailed work and with [[copper]], [[tin]], and [[bronze]] for larger sculptures. Classical pieces using this technique include the [[bronze]] [[Greece|Greek]] armour plates from the 3rd century BC.

During the 3rd millennium BC, in the Middle East, a variety of semi-mass production methods were introduced to avoid repetitive free-hand work. With the simplest technique, sheet gold could be pressed into designs carved in ''intaglio'' in stone, bone, metal or even materials such as [[jet (lignite)|jet]].  The gold could be worked into the designs with wood tools or, more commonly, by hammering a wax or lead "force" over it.
  
[[Image:Byzantine - Chalice with Apostles Venerating the Cross - Walters 57636 - Profile.jpg|thumb| One of twenty-three silver altar vessels believed to have been found in the Syrian village of Kurin.  Silver repoussé, partial gilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]
 |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/9463
 |title=Chalice with Apostles Venerating the Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walters Art Museum.]]
The alternative to pressing gold sheet into a die is to work it over a design in cameo relief.  Here the detail would be greater on the back of the final design, so some final chasing from the front was often carried out to sharpen the detail. The use of patterned punches dates back to the first half of the [[2nd millennium BC]], if not far earlier. The simplest patterned punches were produced by loops or scrolls of wire. By [[Hellenistic]] times, combined punches and dies were in use.

In 1400 BC, the Egyptian [[Amarna]] period, resin and mud for repoussé backing was in use.  In 400 BC, the Greeks were using Beeswax for filler in repoussé.

Repoussé and chasing are commonly used in [[India]] to create objects such as water vessels. These vessels are generally made using sheets of [[copper]] or [[silver]].

During the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] and [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] periods of the American [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] goods of repoussé copper were fashioned as ritual regalia and eventually used in prestige burials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Power | first = Susan | title = Early Art of the Southeastern Indians-Feathered Serpents and Winged Beings | publisher = [[University of Georgia Press]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8203-2501-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples have been found with many S.E.C.C. designs such as [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Motifs|Bi-lobed arrow motif]] headdresses and [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|falcon dancer]] plaques.

== Methods ==
[[Image:Maurice Ascalon 2.jpg|thumb|Sculptor [[Maurice Ascalon]] at work undertaking the finishing chasing of a copper repoussé relief sculpture circa 1939.]]

It can be laborious to create jewellery or art using repoussé and chasing techniques, although with practice, complex and delicate pieces can be made which would be virtually impossible to complete using any other method.

Several different metals are used for chasing and repousse work, including drawn steel, silicon bronze, copper, gold, silver and pewter.

The process of chasing / repousse takes a lot of time due to the repetition of a number of time-consuming stages:  The first step is the preparation of the metal by [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]; cleaning to remove the [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] between annealing and work; setting up; and careful work with punches.  This process is typically repeated many times during the creation of a chasing/repousse work.

One method of repoussé and chasing is to place a thin sheet of metal on a bowl of chasers pitch. This chasers pitch can be pine rosin–based that can be kept slightly soft with a heat gun or plumbers torch for relief work and hardens when cooled for chasing/planishing work. It can become extremely soft or liquefied when heated too much, becoming somewhat of a burn hazard.  It is not recommended, nor necessary to heat the pitch to this degree.

The purpose of using pitch is to provide a solid base to work on, whilst allowing the metal to be pushed out and shaped without obstruction. The pitch is best worked on in a ''pitch bowl'' or "pitch board."  The pitch bowl is a [[cast iron]] bowl which sits on a bag stuffed with [[sand]] or on a rubber ring specifically made for this purpose.  This allows for greater stability, [[rotation]] and angling.  The pitch is heated using a [[hairdryer]], or an industrial blowdryer. If the pitch is too hard, the metal will be thinned.  If it is too soft, there is very little control over the form. A good medium grade chasers pitch works well because it softens enough to allow for satisfactory relief and cools to a firmness that is sufficient for chasing, planishing and detail work.

[[File:Repujado- caballo griego alestilo del período geométrico, por el artista mexicano Manolo Vega, 2011.jpg|left|thumb|Repoussè on tin sheet – "Greek horse" by Mexican artist Manolo Vega, 2011]] 
   
[[Steel]] [[tool]]s are used to work the metal. A "liner" is a steel tool/punch with a very thin, slightly rounded end, that is used to create the initial lines on the metal. The liner is hit on the end with a ''chasing hammer'', pushing a thin line of metal into the pitch. The side facing up will consequently be the front of the piece. Once all the lines have been chased, the metal is then turned over on the pitch, and repoussé technique is then applied, using other various steel punches/tools to push the metal so that it is raised on the front of the finished piece.

Once the design has been raised and the repousse is done, the piece is inverted and the voids are filled with warm pitch to help maintain its shape. The pitch should be allowed to set in the voids and cool before the piece is turned over and placed back on the pitch. Once the piece of metal is turned over and then chased, in that the details are refined and brought out. The design is worked many times, with numerous tools, before the final result is achieved.

Every time the metal is removed from the pitch bowl, it needs to be cleaned and re-annealed. [[Turpentine]] is used to remove the pitch, and a blow torch can also be used to burn it off.

== Tools ==

There are hundreds of tools which can be used. They are generally made by the jeweller/crafts person.  They are typically made from bars of ''[[tool steel]]'', which is [[forge]]d and [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempered]] at the tip.  These hardened steel punches may be purchased by a supplier, but the specialized punches are made by the jeweler or special ordered to suit a particular design.&lt;ref name=Bowie&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowie|first=Hamish|title=Jewelry Making|year=1977|publisher=Henry Regnery Company|location=Chicago|isbn=0-8092-8084-1|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[saw]] can be used to cut designs into the tip for making patterns, or the tool can be hammered onto a patterned surface, which will indent the tip. The end of the tool which is to be hammered should be bevelled to allow for expansion of the metal from repeated hammering. Some of the main styles of tool include: ''Liners'', ''planishers'', ''matting'', and ''doming''. Liners have thin tips, which are slightly rounded.  If they are too thin they will cut the metal. They are used in the initial marking out of the design, and in the finishing stages to refine any thin outlines.  Planishers have  smooth, flat tips which are used for pushing out large, flat areas of metal. Matting tools have patterns cut into them, and provide detail to areas of the design.  Matting tools can also be made by filing a thin line around a steel bar, hardening it, then snapping it.  This will result in a fine grain pattern. Doming tools push out rounded areas of metal, and can either be round or oval, quite pointed or almost flat. An [[oxyacetylene]] torch, coal forge or propane forge is required for heating the steel sufficiently for forging. The more tools available, the easier it is to create a detailed, accurate piece.

== Recipes for pitch ==
The [[traditional]] working surface is chaser's pitch which is usually a [[wikt:composition|composition]] combining three substances: pure pitch, a ''filler'' (or stiffener), and an ''[[emollient]]'' (softening medium). There are a number of different recipes for making chaser's pitch. One example is:

*16 parts [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]
*20 parts [[plaster of Paris]]
*4 parts [[resin]]
*1 part [[tallow]]

The pitch is heated until molten.  Plaster of Paris is added a small amount at a time.  Resin and tallow are then mixed in.

Pitch is backing and filler material, preferably rosin-based, but also petroleum-based, used by metalsmiths to hold the metal in place while working it.

There is a flexible pitch used by chasers referred to as Swedish pitch.

There are other pitch choices, with two very popular choices being Red (or sometimes referred to as brown) German Pitch and a versatile medium (grade/hardness) dark green chasers pitch.  There is also a black pitch.

The different pitches are used preferentially and according to the type of chasing and repousse work being done.

This pitch material can be re-used indefinitely if used and stored properly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3081">[[Image:BlakeMalkin.jpg|thumb|William Blake's frontispiece to ''A Father's Memoirs of his Child'' (1806), engraved by Cromek.]]
'''Robert Hartley Cromek''' (1770–1812) was an English engraver, editor, art dealer and entrepreneur who was most active in the early nineteenth century. He is best known for having allegedly cheated [[William Blake]] out of the potential profits of his engraving depicting Chaucer's [[Canterbury Pilgrims]].

In the early years of the nineteenth century Cromek had supported Blake, and had engraved Blake's design for [[Benjamin Heath Malkin]]'s ''A Father's Memoirs of his Child'' in 1806. Cromek later commissioned Blake to illustrate [[Robert Blair (poet)|Robert Blair]]'s poem ''The Grave''. Blake had produced the designs, but his sample engraving was considered by Cromek to be too crude to attract subscribers. Cromek then gave the lucrative job of engraving Blake's designs to a rival engraver [[Luigi Schiavonetti]].

In response, Blake proceeded to create a self-engraved illustration to Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales''. Cromek, however, had also given the idea to Blake's friend [[Thomas Stothard]]. Stothard's print became far more popular than Blake's, at least during their lifetimes. It remains unclear whether Blake or Cromek originated this project, but Blake certainly believed that the idea was stolen from him. The incident destroyed the friendship between Blake and Stothard.&lt;ref&gt;Blake v. Cromek: A Contemporary Ruling, J. B. Mertz, ''Modern Philology'', Vol. 99, No. 1 (Aug., 2001), pp. 66-77&lt;/ref&gt;

As a savagely humorous comment on these events Blake wrote epigrams attacking Cromek:&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, Geoffrey, ''Blake: Complete Writings with variant readings'', Oxford University Press, 1972, p.540&lt;/ref&gt;   
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cromek loves artists as he loves his meat:&lt;br&gt;
He loves the Art; but 'tis the art to cheat.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A petty sneaking knave I knew--&lt;br&gt;
"O! Mr. Cromek, how do ye do?"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1809 Cromek published ''Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song'', a collection of Scottish ballads. The aspirant poet [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]] sent in poems of his own authorship, which Cromek included in the collection, even though he may have suspected their real authorship.

About that time Cromek also compiled "RELIQUES OF ROBERT BURNS; Consisting Chiefly of Original Letters, Poems, and Critical Observations on Scottish Songs ". The original edition of 1808 contained a 4-page work by Thomas Stothard, "The Procession of Chaucer's Pilgrims to Canterbury", which did not appear in some later editions.

His son was the artist [[Thomas Hartley Cromek]].&lt;ref name=wake&gt;{{cite news|last=Fowler|first=James|title=A Biographical Notice of Thomas Hartley Cromek, Esq.|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Wakefield_Express/Thomas_Hartley_Cromek|newspaper=Wakefield Express|date=19 April 1873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sacred dance''' is the use of [[dance]] in religious ceremonies and rituals, present in most religions throughout history and prehistory. Its connection with the body and fertility has caused it to be forbidden by some religions; for example, its acceptability in Christianity has varied widely. Dance has formed a major element of worship in Hindu temples with strictly formalized styles such as [[bharatanatyam]], requiring skilled dancers and temple musicians. In the 20th century, sacred dance has been revived by choreographers such as Bernhard Wosien as a means of developing community spirit.&lt;ref name="Gaston Gaston 2014"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gaston | first=Anne-Marie (Anjali) | last2=Gaston | first2=Tony | title=Oxford Handbooks Online | chapter=Dance as a Way of Being Religious | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=1 February 2014 | doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195176674.013.010 | editor=Brown, Frank Burch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purposes==

[[W. O. E. Oesterley]] proposed in 1923 that sacred dance had several purposes, the most important being to honour the supernatural powers; the other purposes were to "show off" before the powers; to unite the dancer with the supernatural power (such as with the [[ancient Greece|Greek]]&lt;ref name="Lawler 1947"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawler |first1=Lillian Brady |title=The Dance in Ancient Greece |journal=The Classical Journal |date=March 1947 |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=343–349 |jstor=291645}}&lt;/ref&gt; goddesses [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]]); making the body suitable as a temporary dwelling-place for the deity, by dancing to unconsciousness in [[ecstatic dance]]; making crops grow, or helping or encouraging the deity to make them grow (as with "Ariadne's Dance"); consecrating a victim for sacrifice (as with the [[Israelites]] circling the altar, or the [[Sarawak]] Kayans circling a sacrificial pig); paying homage to the deity present for an initiation ceremony; helping warriors to victory in battle, and appeasing the spirits of the enemy killed in battle; averting the dangers associated with marriage, at a wedding ceremony; and at a funeral or mourning ceremony, purposes such as driving away the malevolent ghost of the dead person, or preventing the ghost from leaving the grave, or frightening off any evil spirits attracted by the corpse, or temporarily and invisibly bringing the dead person back to join in the dance, or simply honouring the dead person.{{sfn|Oesterley|2010|pp=22–30 and passim&lt;!--He structures rest of book around this set of purposes.--&gt;}}

Harriet Lihs in 2009 divided religious [[dance]] into dances of imitation, such as of animals thought to be [[Spirit guide|spirit messenger]]s, or of battles; "medicine dances", i.e. dances of healing, like the serpent dances in India used to prevent disease; commemorative dances, for events such as the [[winter solstice]]; and dances for spiritual connection, as in the whirling dance of the [[Whirling Dervish]]es withn Sufism.{{sfn|Lihs|2009|pp=6–7}} 

Laura Shannon in 2018 stated the purposes of contemporary sacred dance as practised at the [[Findhorn Foundation]] as "to be inclusive, mutually supportive, to connect with the earth, spirit and each other, and to become more whole." It was a means of channelling "healing energy" both for the dancers and for their families and communities, indeed for the whole world.&lt;ref name="Shannon 2018"/&gt;

Within religion, [[ecstatic dance]] is one of the ways in which [[religious ecstasy]] is produced.&lt;ref name="Ulland 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ulland | first=Dagfinn | title=Embodied Spirituality | journal=Archive for the Psychology of Religion | volume=34 | issue=1 | date=1 January 2012 | doi=10.1163/157361212x645340 | pages=83–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ancient times==
{{further|Ceremonial dance}}

Indigenous [[ceremonial dance]] rituals around the world appear to preserve forms that were widespread in ancient times. For example, processionals and circle dances seen in indigenous dance today were [[Dance in ancient Egypt|used in ancient Egypt]] and among the Hebrews.{{sfn|Lihs|2009|pp=7–8}} In ancient Egypt, dancers impersonated a deity such as the goddess [[Hathor]], taking on the deity's attributes and interpreting the divine world for those watching.&lt;ref name="Mark 2017"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mark |first1=Joshua J. |title=Music &amp; Dance in Ancient Egypt |url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/1075/music--dance-in-ancient-egypt/ |publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ancient Israel, [[King David]] danced "before the Lord".&lt;ref&gt;2 [[Samuel (bible)|Samuel]] 6:5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark 2017"/&gt; It is mentioned as something familiar, implying it was a common practice.{{sfn|Oesterley|2010|p=37}} Sacred dance is described in the Bible by verbs meaning dancing, rotating, jumping, skipping, and whirling.{{sfn|Oesterley|2010|pp=44–53}} The dance was accompanied by hand-drums (tambourines), cymbals, flutes, pipes, lyres, harps, and lutes.{{sfn|Oesterley|2010|pp=52}}

The [[Hittites]] are shown in a sacred processional dance in a c. 1200 BC rock inscription at the sanctuary of [[Yazılıkaya]], near their city of [[Hattusa]], in [[Cappadocia]]. A group of men wearing conical hats and tip-tilted shoes, and a group of women, dance in a running step towards a group of named gods and goddesses.{{sfn|Oesterley|2010|p=59}} 

In ancient Greece, sacred dance was widespread; indeed, it formed a part of almost all worship, and the gods [[Apollo]], [[Ares]], [[Dionysus]] and [[Pan (god)|Pan]] are all described as dancers, while other deities such as [[Artemis]] were described as dancing with their companions.{{sfn|Oesterley|2010|pp=64, 68}} 

The Hawaiian [[Hula]] dances to [[Pele (deity)|Pele]], the volcano goddess, survive, whereas European [[maypole dance]]s have lost their meaning as tree-worship and survive only as folk tradition.{{sfn|Lihs|2009|pp=7–8}} 

Lewis Farnell observed that sacred dance has an "extraordinary uniformity" among indigenous peoples all over the world, something that he found so striking that it suggested either "belief in an ultimately identical tradition, or, perhaps more reasonably, the psychologic theory that ... [humans] at the same stage of development respond with the same ... religious act to the same stimuli" from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Farnell |first1=Lewis Richard |authorlink1=Lewis Richard Farnell |title=The Evolution of Religion {{!}} An Anthropological Study |date=2009 |origyear=2005 |publisher=Cornell University Library |isbn=978-1112156984 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oesterley suggested that these stimuli to sacred dance were people's response to supernatural power, and "the obtaining of food."{{sfn|Oesterley|2010|pp=2–3}}

===Christianity===

Some Christian traditions make use of [[Liturgical dance|liturgical]] or [[worship dance]], but it has long been controversial within the church.&lt;ref name="Mark 2017"/&gt; It has been supported, sometimes fervently, by both priests and Christian scholars; and opposed, sometimes stridently, by others who for example wrote some 157 tracts against dance between 1685 and 1963. The early church was largely in favour of dance, as in the 2nd Century ''[[Acts of John]]'' which states that "Grace danceth. I would pipe: dance ye all. The whole world on high hath part in our dancing."{{sfn|Lihs|2009|pp=14–16}} [[Circle dance]] is used, in its more meditative form, in worship within religious traditions including the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;"We ended with a circle dance."

===Islam and Sufism===

Dance is unusual within Islam, but circle dance is used in the Islamic [[Haḍra]] dances.&lt;ref name="Shiloah 2001"/&gt; In the tradition of the [[Mevlevi Order]] founded by [[Rumi]], ecstatic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Erzen |first1=Jale |title=The Dervishes Dance -- The Sacred Ritual of Love |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.7523862.0006.007 |journal=Contemporary Aesthetics |volume=6 |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sufi whirling]] is practised by devotees as a form of active meditation within the [[Sema|Sama]] (worship ceremony).&lt;ref name="MOA sema"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm |title=The Sema of the Mevlevi |publisher=Mevlevi Order of America |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121221021339/http://www.hayatidede.org/popups/about_sema.htm |archivedate=21 December 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Sufi practices including ecstatic dance and the reciting of religious poetry were a focus for political resistance in Iran, reportedly "demoniz[ed]" by [[Shi'a]] clerics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scolieri |first1=Paul |title=Introduction  Global/Mobile:  Re-orienting Dance and Migration Studies |journal=Dance Research Journal |date=2008 |volume=40 |issue=2 (Winter) |page=XVII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syncretic===

The syncretic [[Afro-American religion|Afro-American religious tradition]] [[Candomblé]], practiced mainly in [[Brazil]], makes use of music and ecstatic dance in which worshippers become possessed by their own tutelary deities, [[Orisha]]s.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/candomble/ataglance/glance.shtml "Religions - Candomblé: Candomblé at glance"].

==Modern==

Choreographers starting with [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Ruth St. Denis]] and her husband [[Ted Shawn]], and [[Martha Graham]] developed [[contemporary dance]] early in the 20th century, often using elements of sacred dance and fusing them with other genres. Later choreographers also made use of themes from the bible.&lt;ref name=SDG&gt;{{cite web |title=About Sacred Dance |url=http://sacreddanceguild.org/about/about-sacred-dance/ |publisher=Sacred Dance Guild |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clemente 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Clemente | first=Karen | title=The Sacred or the Profane: The Challenge of Modern Dance in Religious Educational Settings | journal=Journal of Dance Education | volume=8 | issue=2 | year=2008 | doi=10.1080/15290824.2008.10387360 | pages=62–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mysticism|mystic]] and spiritual teacher [[George Gurdjieff]] collected or authored a series of sacred dances, known as [[Gurdjieff movements]], and taught them to his students as part of what he considered the work of ''self observation'' and ''self study''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction |url=http://gurdjieff-dances.com/eng/ |publisher=Gurdjieff Dances |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dances of Universal Peace]], created by North American Sufis, use dancing, Sufi whirling, and singing of sacred phrases from different religions to raise consciousness and promote peace between diverse religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About The Dances of Universal Peace |url=https://www.dancesofuniversalpeace.org/about.shtm |publisher=Dances of Universal Peace |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lihs|2009|p=17}}

From 1976, the ballet master and choreographer {{ill|Bernhard Wosien|de}} introduced [[circle dance]] at the [[Findhorn Foundation]] in Scotland. He used both traditional dances and his own choreography to develop "group awareness".{{sfn|Watts|2006|pp=6–10}} Wosien's approach was taken up by Anna Barton, both at Findhorn and across Europe in the 1980s, and this style of sacred dance spread around the world.&lt;ref name="Shannon 2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shannon |first1=Laura |title=Sacred Dance, Armenian Dance |url=https://www.findhorn.org/blog/sacred-dance-in-findhorn/ |publisher=[[Findhorn Foundation]] |accessdate=3 November 2018 |date=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

The '''Sarcofagi of Carajía''' are unusually large [[Sarcophagus|sarcofagi]] in [[Carajía]], Peru.

The Sarcofagi of Carajía are unique in their genre for their colossal size, up to 2.50 m high, for their careful making, and, for the fact, that they were remained practically intact because of their location atop a [[Canyon|ravine]] of difficult access.

==Antisuyo expedition==
Although the model of [[burial]] using [[coffin]]s of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphous]] shape and [[Sarcophagus|sarcofagi]], was already mentioned in the ''[[Mercurio Peruano]]'' (1791) as part of the cultural area of [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and it deserved the attention of [[Louis Langlois]] (1939) and of the archaeologists [[Henry Reichlen|Henry]] and [[Paule Reichlen]] (1950), this [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]]'s peculiarity of burying their illustrious deceased was almost completely forgotten. The [[Antisuyo expedition|Antisuyo Expedition]]/84 located, at [[Carajía]], the most amazing group of [[Sarcophagus|sarcofagi]] known till then, thanks to references provided by [[Carlos Torres Mas]] and [[Marino Torrejón]]. It was remaining completely unpublished and still untouched.

Thanks to the support given by members of the [[Club Andino Peruano]], the archaeologists were able to climb 24 m of rocky vertical wall and gain access to the cave where the sarcofagi are located. This place is located to more than 200 m from the bottom of the [[Canyon|gorge]]. The Sarcofagi of Carajía consists of a group of seven [[Sarcophagus|sarcofagi]]. The eighth one collapsed probably during the [[earthquake]] of 1928, disappearing in the abyss. Since the sarcofagi are sideways next to each other, the one which collapsed opened some holes in the contiguous sides of the next.

==Findings==
This fact allowed scientists to investigate in detail the content of this [[Sarcophagus|sarcofagi]] and to determine the content of the remaining ones. In this way, the remaining ones did not have to be forced and they remain intact. Inside the open [[Sarcophagus|sarcofagus]], a mummy was found. It sat on an animal skin and was wrapped in mortuary [[Textile|cloths]]. [[Pottery|Ceramics]] and diverse objects were accompanying the deceased as gifts. The date obtained by [[Carbon-14|radiocarbon]] was 1460 AC +60. [[Rodent]]s and [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] had disturbed the [[burial]], after the holes had appeared in the sarcophagus. The sarcofagus was emptied by scientists to preserve the mummy and its belongings.

The sarcofagi are shaped into big anthropomorphous capsules, made of [[clay]] and mixed with [[Branch|sticks]] and [[Rock (geology)|stones]]. Only the [[head]] and part of the [[chest]] are compact. Both body and head are decorated by red painting of two tones, applied over a white base.

==Appearance of sarcofagi==
It is believed that the sarcofagi are evocations of the typical form of [[funeral bundle]] found in the [[chala|coast]] and in the mountain range, corresponding to the period of the [[Tiwanaku|Tiahuanaco]]-[[Huari Culture|Huari]]. In effect, the anthropomorphous form has been only given in the outlines of the human body, without the forms corresponding to the extremities taking shape. It is necessary to notice that the head of the sarcophagus has received sculptural treatment, and the face is the result of copying in clay funeral masks that were originally done in a wooden table, cut away in a half moon shape to represent the jaw.

The projecting jaw that the sarcofagi present has to be made by having reproduced in clay the flat funeral masks worked in the base of a wooden table. Apparently the faces of the monoliths of [[Recuay culture|Recuay]], the ''cuchimilcos'' of [[Chancay culture|Chancay]] and even that represented in the [[Tumi]] of [[Lambayeque culture|Lambayeque]], were made in the same way.

==Related discoveries==
Another several groups of sarcofagi present in the region are those of [[Tingorbamba's sarcophagus|Tingorbamba]] and [[Chipuric's sarcophagus|Chipuric]], documented by the [[Antisuyo expedition|Antisuyo Expeditions]].

'''Tau tau''' are a type of [[effigy]] made of wood or [[bamboo]]. They are particular to the [[Toraja]] ethnic group in [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]. The word "''tau''" means "''man''", and "''tau tau''" means "''men''" or "''statue''".&lt;ref name=raw&gt;{{Cite news

Tau tau are believed to have originated in the 19th century. They were once produced only for the wealthy, to reflect the status and wealth of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In the early 1900s, with the arrival of the Dutch Christian missionaries in Toraja, the production of tau tau was somewhat dampened. At the 1985 synod of Toraja Church in Palopo people debated if Protestant Toraja could have tau tau at their funerals.&lt;ref name="[[Kathleen M. Adams]]"&gt;Adams, Kathleen M. 2006 ''Art as Politics: Re-crafting Identities, Tourism and Power in Tana Toraja, Indonesia. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press. http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-9780824830724.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Torajans believe that the dead can take their possessions with them to the after life, the effigies are usually equipped with small possessions. In 1980s, the wooden effigies became a target for grave robbers looted and possessions kept with them and sold the figures to museums.  Tau tau can now be found in Jakarta, Europe and America, and were once even on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="Volkman1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Volkman|first=Toby Alice|title=Visions and Revisions: Toraja Culture and the Tourist Gaze|journal= American Ethnologist |issue=1| volume=17| pages=91–110|doi=10.1525/ae.1990.17.1.02a00060|date=February 1990| jstor=645254}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this plunder of the ancestors, the Torajans hid their tau tau in various undisclosed locations. They also installed metal fences surrounding their cave graves to protect the tau tau. It is somewhat ironic that the tau tau is meant to represent the deceased protecting the living, but they now have to be protected against the living.&lt;ref name="Adams1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Kathleen M.|title=Theologians. Tourists. and Thieves: The Torajan Effigy of the Dead in Modernizing Indonesia|journal= Kyoto Journal| volume=22 |pages=38–46|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the effigies were simply carved, only to show the gender of the deceased. However, they have become more and more elaborate, actually attempting to imitate the likeness of the deceased. Nowadays, tau tau have photographic likeness to the people they represent. They are carved with wrinkles and carry items like Bibles.&lt;ref name="[[Kathleen M. Adams]]"/&gt;

The types of wood used for the effigies and what they are clothed in also reflect the status and wealth of the deceased. Tau tau of the wealthy would generally be made of wood from the jackfruit tree. They are usually permanent statues that can be found standing at the entrance of tombs, which are carved out of rock faces of Toraja. Their position, in reference to the other tau tau, in the rock face would indicate the status of the deceased. The cave builders usually require payment of several buffalos that only the sufficiently wealthy can afford.&lt;ref name=raw/&gt; The less wealthy elites generally have their tau tau made from bamboo, which will be undressed at the end of the funeral, leaving only the bamboo on the ritual field. There are regional variations in the types of tau tau used, also.

==Exhibition==
The exhibition was curated by art historian Rangihiroa Panoho for the [[Sarjeant Art Gallery]] in [[Whanganui]] in 1990 and the metropolitan City Galleries in Wellington and in Auckland in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abadia|first1=Karina|title=Maori Art Book Takes Inclusive Approach|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/books/69254057/maori-art-book-takes-inclusive-approach|website=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=20 June 2015|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's starting point and its iconic motif was a Tahitian tivaevae featuring the Genesis story of the 'Dream of Joseph' or ''Te moemoea no Iotefa''. The exhibition initially filled all spaces of the historic Sarjeant Gallery building, an earlier version of the Wellington City Art Gallery and the entire first floor of the Auckland Art Gallery.&lt;ref name="Moemoea"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Panoho|first1=Rangihiroa|title=Te Moemoea no Iotefa (The dream of Joseph)|date=1990|publisher=Sarjeant Art Gallery|location=Whanganui}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the exhibition catalogue Panoho outlined the South Pacific as, 'Aotearoa's most immediate historical, geographical and cultural context', and that he was seeking to 'examine and explore the visual side of this context and the ways in which artists in this country are exploring it'.&lt;ref name="Moemoea" /&gt; The exhibition brought together four strands of art making:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. The wealth of material culture from the Pacific Islands found in museums, libraries, private collections - [[taonga]] such as historical writing, photographs, [[tapa cloth|tapa]], tivaevae, weaving and carving.

2. Work currently being produced by Pacific Islanders living in New Zealand such as tivaevae and carving.

3. Work by [[palagi]] artists in this country (e.g. [[Tony Fomison|Fomison]], Shepherd, [[Vivian Lynn|Lynn]], [[Barry Lett Galleries|Lett]], [[Pat Hanly|Hanly]], McMillan, Adams, and Jowitt) which constitutes a response to Pacific Island subject and motif.

4. Work by contemporary Pacific artists utilising a Western aesthetic - to draw on and interpret their particular island cultures.&lt;ref name ='Moemoea'/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exhibition 'wove together the various aspects of Pacific culture as it persists in Aotearoa'.&lt;ref name ='Paradise'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chiu|first1=Melissa|last2=Stevenson|first2=Karen|last3=Mason|first3=Ngahiraka|last4=Vercoe|first4=Caroline|title=Paradise now? : contemporary art from the Pacific|date=2004|publisher=David Bateman in association with Asia Society|location=Auckland|isbn=1869535847}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|24}} Art historian Nicholas Thomas writes 'Museum artifacts were placed with contemporary art, folk crafts with paintings, archive photographs with contemporary images, and Pacific artists among white appropriators of culture'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Nicholas|title=The Dream of Joseph: Practices of Identity in Pacific Art|journal=The Contemporary Pacific|date=1996|volume=8|issue=2|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition catalogue contains interviews with 10 contemporary artists included in the show:

*Iosefa Leo
*[[Fatu Feu'u]]
*Jim Vivieaere
*[[Lily Laita]]
*[[John Pule]]
*[[Michel Tuffery]]
*Johnny Peninsula
*[[Ioane Ioane]]
*Sale Jessop
*[[Sopolemalama Filipe Tohi|Filipe Tohi]]

Te Moemoea was also an exploration of Pacificness as it more diversely related to broader creative activity in Aotearoa. As curator Panoho was not exclusively looking at contemporary Pacific art. As with his show 'Whatu Aho Rua' (1989/1992 - another Sarjeant exhibition involving historical and contemporary material) he was also interested in historical Pacific collections of tapa, fibre, photography and carving and in how non-Pacific artists were working with Pacific communities and in how they were interpreting the material and the ideas that they valorised. Te Moemoea while initiated from within a regional institution travelled to and was reinvented by Panoho and gallery staff within the Whanganui, Wellington and Auckland gallery spaces. A newspaper review from Wellington helps clarify the complexity and the layered nature of the content within Te Moemoea: ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Cross-currents crackle around the latest exhibition at Wellington's City Gallery. People who like to keep art in neat pigeonholes... will probably find '''Te Moemoea no Iotefa''' (Joseph's dream defeats them. Rangihīroa Panoho...has curated a lively exhibition which aims to be a lot more than a showcase for artists with a Pacific Island background who are working in New Zealand. It is that, but it's also a visual essay about cross-fertilisation''.' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pihirau.co.nz/maori-curator-ii-future-flowerings/|title=Margot Porter, 'Visual Essays of the Pacific', The Dominion, 20 July 1991|last=|first=|date=|website=Pihirau Productions Ltd|publisher=Pihirau|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

==Reception and influence==
''Te Moemoea no Iotefa'' has been described as 'the first group exhibition to celebrate the dynamism of Pacific art'.&lt;ref name='Pasifika'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raymond|first1=Rosanna|last2=Salmond|first2=Amiria|title=Pasifika Styles|date=2008|publisher=University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology; Otago University Press|location=Cambridge and Dunedin|isbn=0947595155}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|40}}

Pacific art historian Peter Brunt saw '''''Te Moemoea''''' as, ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The first exhibition to focus on contemporary Pacific art in a civic gallery in New Zealand was Te Moemoea no Iotefa '[the Dream of Joseph: A Celebration of Pacific Art and Taonga]...The exhibition thematized the presence of Pacific culture in New Zealand society, introduced community-based arts like tivaevae into the contemporary gallery, and canvassed the work of migrant artists like Fatu Feu'u, Johnny Penisula, Michel Tuffery and others, only then beginning to garner serious public attention. But it was the title that was the most prescient about its own historical significance. The title was borrowed from the title of a tivaevae it showed, and refers to the biblical story of Joseph sold into slavery in Egypt by his brothers, eventually to rise to a position of power in the Pharoah's court. Joseph's dream turns out to be an allegory of the moment of recognition when, as an exile, he reveals himself to his brothers as the important person he has become. The ambiguity of the allegory lies in the question of whether recognition in Egypt or escape from Egypt (if we can pardon the Orientalism) is the preferable goal''.' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pihirau.co.nz/maori-curator-ii-future-flowerings/|title=Art in Oceania|last=Brunt|first=Peter|date=2012|website=Pihirau Productions Ltd|publisher=Thames and Hudson|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition contributed to a sense of group identification amongst a group of young or emerging artists, including Ioane, Tuffery, Laita and [[John Pule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallon|first1=Sean|last2=Pereira|first2=Pandora Fulimalo|title=Speaking in colour : conversations with artists of Pacific Island heritage|date=1997|publisher=Te Papa Press|location=Wellington|isbn=0909010447}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|134}}The exhibition is seen as an important precursor to [[Bottled Ocean]], a 1994 exhibition focused on the work of contemporary Pacific artists.&lt;ref name="Oceania" /&gt;{{Rp|432}}

Art historian Karen Stevenson notes the importance of the exhibition in building the careers of participating artists:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With the success of ''Te Moemoea no Iotefa'', Pacific artists found exhibition space more readily available, and as recognition of Pacific artists grew, dealer galleries and community centers became interested in hosting "Pacific" exhibitions. Group "Pacific" shows became regular occurrences in art galleries throughout the country, as did solo exhibitions at dealer galleries."&lt;ref name ='Paradise'/&gt;{{Rp|25}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Flight into Egypt''''' is a painting by [[Nicolas Poussin]] painted in 1657 or 1658. It was originally kept in the [[Musée du Louvre]], then was transferred to the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon]].

==History==
The painting was probably inspired by [[The Flight into Egypt (Annibale Carracci)|a painting on the same theme]] by Italian Baroque painter [[Annibale Carracci]]. 

This painting appeared in an auction in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] in 1986 with 80,000 francs as initial price. It was bought by Richard and Robert Pardo for 1,600,000 francs. Exhibited in the gallery, it was later recognized as an authentic work of the artist. Then there was a lengthy trial whose outcome was unfavorable to Pardo : the final decision was to re-give the painting to the seller. The owner then wanted to sell this work for more than 15 million euros. The Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon then began to collect the money to acquire it.

In July 2007, the Louvre and the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon were finally able to raise the funds necessary to purchase the painting. It would one of the most expensive work ever collected by the [[patronage]], with a cost of 17 million euros (1 million provided by the Mayor of Lyon, 250,000 by the Rhône-Alpes region, 1 million by the Musée du Louvre with its own funds, and over 18 patrons such as [[Gaz de France]] which gave 3 million euros, [[Total SA]], [[AXA]], businesses and banks of Lyon and a private donor). The work was acquired for the Louvre and was transferred in February 2008 at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon, the hometown of Jacques Sérisier, who was the first collector of the painting and who was probably its sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel de Roux and Nathaniel Herzberg, "Grandes manœuvres pour conserver en France un tableau de Poussin", ''[[Le Monde]]'', 17 February 2007, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Roloff, "Un Poussin pour le musée de Lyon", Grande Galerie, ''Le Journal du Louvre'', n° 1, Autumn 2007, pages 76-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"''La Fuite en Égypte'' de Poussin racheté par l'État", ''Le Monde'', 19 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"17 millions d'euros pour ''La Fuite en Egypte'' de Poussin", ''Le Monde'', 20 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3052">'''YoloArts''' (formerly known as the '''Yolo County Arts Council''') is a [[non-profit organization]], founded in 1981 as a recommendation of the [[Yolo County]] Cultural Plan to further the arts and culture of the county.

YoloArts mission is to cultivate and advocate support for all the arts, to participate in advancement of arts education in ours schools and community, and to foster communication among artists, business, education, government, and the residents of Yolo County.

==Programs==
YoloArts is known for its Arts Education and Outreach Programs which include Artists in Schools, ArtMix, Blues in YoloSchools, the Art &amp; Ag Project, Art in Public Places, Artists Workshops, YoloArts Musical Tour and Exhibitions at Gallery 625.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yoloarts.org/programs-and-services | title=Art Education and Outreach Programs | accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2012, [[National Endowment for the Arts]] chairman Rocco Landesman visited YoloArts to learn more about their Art &amp; Ag Project which has local Yolo County Artists interacting with local farmers at their farms to create artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WDDB&amp;p_theme=wddb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=allfields%28Art%20%2526%20Ag%20Project%29%20AND%20date%282012%29&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=2012&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=%28%22Art%22%20%26%20%22Ag%20Project%22%29&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no | date=February 22, 2012 |title=Smith: Woodland put on the national map for 'Ag &amp; Art'| agency=The Daily Democrat | accessdate=May 14, 2012 | author=Smith, Jim}}{{registration required|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists get regular, and safe, access to the landscapes they wish to paint or photograph. Farmers, in turn, benefit as well, with often publicly displayed art showcasing their land.

“This program has reminded people that the countryside is beautiful and the farmland is beautiful and if we don’t pay attention, it could be gone,” said Esparto resident Claire Haag, whose marriage is an art and ag project in itself — she’s a painter and her husband, James, is a [[walnut]] grower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/ag-environment/ag-and-art-project-brings-nea-chair-to-yolo-county/ | title=Ag and Art Project brings NEA chair to Yolo | date=February 22, 2012 | agency=The Davis Enterprise | accessdate=May 14, 2012 | author=Ternus-Bellamy, Anne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locally, the Art and Ag Project is celebrated every fall with an Art Farm Exhibition Gala that features an Art Harvest and Taste of Yolo. There farmers can often be found bidding on the artwork depicting their own land and homes.

==VT summer camp==
Zeno Mountain Farm holds a month long, flagship, [[summer camp]] in July in which the participants engage in a variety of activities.  Campers swim, windsurf, do arts and crafts, dance, sing and hold bonfires.  The two main activities are creating a float and costumes for the annual 4 July parade held in the town of [[Bristol, Vermont|Bristol]], and producing and performing a play, open to the public, on the final days of camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Polston |first=Pamela |url=http://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/zeno-mountain-farm-attracts-campers-and-volunteers-of-all-abilities/Content?oid=2398355 |title=Zeno Mountain Farm Attracts Campers and Volunteers of All Abilities &amp;#124; Culture &amp;#124; Seven Days &amp;#124; Vermont's Independent Voice |website=Sevendaysvt.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satellite camps==
Various other camps and activities are held throughout the year.  Film, music and athletic camps are held in Los Angeles. Every year an original film is produced by the participants and is premiered across the country to help raise funds for the camp.  A sports camp takes place in Jensen Beach, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2013/05/29/bulletproof-indie-film-featuring-disabled-actors-continues-proud-odd-tradition/USkY9ZwsExWO4ERhjlwZ9K/story.html |title=‘Bulletproof,’ an indie film featuring disabled actors, continues a proud, if odd, tradition |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2013-05-30 |accessdate=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Becoming Bulletproof''==
''Becoming Bulletproof'' is a [[Documentary film|documentary]] film that follows the making of a Western style movie by the Zeno participants.  Director Michael Barnett was inspired to make the documentary after attending a film premiere and fundraiser for the camp three years prior to the project.  "Becoming Bulletproof" provides insight into the struggles of film making but its primary focus is on the cultivating of friendships between the actors, crew and other volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/25/movies/review-becoming-bulletproof-follows-a-group-of-disabled-adults-in-a-film-within-a-film.html?_r=0|title=Review: ‘Becoming Bulletproof’ Follows a Group of Disabled Adults in a Film Within a Film|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
