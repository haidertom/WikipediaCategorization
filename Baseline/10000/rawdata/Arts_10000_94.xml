'''Abstract expressionism''' is a post–[[World War II]] [[art movement]] in American painting, developed in New York in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Editors of Phaidon Press|title=The 20th-Century art book.|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|isbn=0714835420|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put [[New York City]] at the center of the western [[art world]], a role formerly filled by Paris. Although the term ''abstract expressionism'' was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]], it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine ''[[Der Sturm]]'', regarding [[German Expressionism]]. In the United States, [[Alfred Barr]] was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by [[Wassily Kandinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Barbara; "Abstract Expressionism", 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
[[File:SMITH CUBI VI.JPG|thumb|upright|[[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]],'' [[Cubi]] VI'' (1963), [[Israel Museum]], [[Jerusalem]]. David Smith was one of the most influential American sculptors of the 20th century.]]

Technically, an important predecessor is [[surrealism]], with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]], or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in the position of the artist and theoretician who fostered the theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space through his paintings and his magazine ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]''. Paalen considered ideas of [[quantum mechanics]], as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia and prepared the ground for the new spatial vision of the young American abstracts. His long essay ''Totem Art'' (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as [[Martha Graham]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Barnett Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Neufert, ''Auf Liebe und Tod, Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'', Berlin (Parthas) 2015, S. 494ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1944 Barnett Newman tried to explain America's newest art movement and included a list of "the men in the new movement." Paalen is mentioned twice; other artists mentioned are Gottlieb, Rothko, Pollock, Hofmann, Baziotes, [[Arshile Gorky|Gorky]] and others. Motherwell is mentioned with a question mark.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Foundation, archive 18/103&lt;/ref&gt; Another important early manifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the [[all-over painting|"all-over"]] look of Pollock's drip paintings.

The movement's name is derived from the combination of the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German [[expressionism|Expressionists]] with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]], and Synthetic [[Cubism]]. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2000 p. 189-190"&gt;Shapiro, David/Cecile (2000), "Abstract Expressionism: The politics of apolitical painting." p. 189–190 In: Frascina, Francis (2000–1): ''Pollock and After: The Critical Debate''. 2nd ed. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even to work that is neither especially abstract nor expressionist. California abstract expressionist [[Jay Meuser]], who typically painted in the non-objective style, wrote about his painting ''Mare Nostrum'', "It is far better to capture the glorious spirit of the sea than to paint all of its tiny ripples." Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different, both technically and aesthetically, from the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]'s [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]] and the rectangles of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s [[Color Field]] paintings (which are not what would usually be called expressionist, and which Rothko denied were abstract). Yet all four artists are classified as abstract expressionists.

Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists' works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. With artists such as [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Emma Kunz]], and later on Rothko, [[Barnett Newman]], and [[Agnes Martin]], abstract art clearly implied expression of ideas concerning the spiritual, the unconscious, and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.). ''3 X Abstraction''. NY: The Drawing Center and /New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]], but also by the [[Mexican muralism|muralists]] of [[Mexico]] such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of these painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early forties at galleries in New York such as [[The Art of This Century Gallery]]. The [[McCarthy era]] after World War II was a time of artistic [[censorship]] in the United States, but if the subject matter were totally [[abstract art|abstract]] then it would be seen as apolitical, and therefore safe. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Guilbaut. ''How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art'', University of Chicago Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the movement is closely associated with painting, and painters such as [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Willem de Kooning]], Jackson Pollock, and others, [[Collage|collagist]] [[Anne Ryan]] and [[sculpture|certain sculptors]] in particular were also integral to abstract expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50253062&amp;tab=holdings ''Americancan Abstract Expressionism of the 1950s An Illustrated Survey,''] (New York School Press, 2003.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-1-4}} pp12–13&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], and his wife [[Dorothy Dehner]], [[Herbert Ferber]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Ibram Lassaw]], [[Theodore Roszak (artist)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Phillip Pavia]], [[Mary Callery]], Richard Stankiewicz, [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Louise Nevelson]] in particular were some of the sculptors considered as being important members of the movement. In addition, the artists [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[James Rosati]], [[Mark di Suvero]], and sculptors [[Richard Lippold]], Raoul Hague, [[George Rickey]], [[Reuben Nakian]], and even [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Seymour Lipton]], [[Joseph Cornell]], and several others&lt;ref name="Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12"&gt;Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50666793&amp;tab=holdings ''New York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists''] (New York School Press, 2000.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-0-6}} p.11–12&lt;/ref&gt; were integral parts of the abstract expressionist movement. Many of the sculptors listed participated in the [[Ninth Street Show]],&lt;ref name="Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12" /&gt; a famous exhibition curated by [[Leo Castelli]] on East Ninth Street in New York City in 1951. Besides the painters and sculptors of the period the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of abstract expressionism also generated a number of supportive poets, including [[Frank O'Hara]] and photographers such as [[Aaron Siskind]] and [[Fred McDarrah]], (whose book ''The Artist's World in Pictures'' documented the New York School during the 1950s), and filmmakers—notably [[Robert Frank]]—as well.

Although the abstract expressionist school spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and the San Francisco Bay area of California.

== Art critics of the post–World War II era ==


{{quote|At a certain moment the canvas began to appear to one American painter after another as an arena in which to act. What was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event.|[[Harold Rosenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;Abstract Expressionism, by Barbara Hess, Taschen, 2005, back cover&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1940s there were not only few galleries ([[The Art of This Century]], [[Pierre Matisse]] Gallery, [[Julien Levy Gallery]] and a few others) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the New York Vanguard.
There were also a few artists with a literary background, among them [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Barnett Newman]], who functioned as critics as well.

While New York and the world were yet unfamiliar with the New York [[avant-garde]] by the late 1940s, most of the artists who have become household names today had their well-established patron critics: [[Clement Greenberg]] advocated [[Jackson Pollock]] and the [[Color Field|color field]] painters like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Hans Hofmann]]; [[Harold Rosenberg]] seemed to prefer the action painters such as [[Willem de Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]], as well as the seminal paintings of [[Arshile Gorky]]; Thomas B. Hess, the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].

The new critics elevated their protégés by casting other artists as "followers"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Hess, "Willem de Kooning", George Braziller, Inc. New York, 1959 p.13&lt;/ref&gt; or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.

In 1958, [[Mark Tobey]] became the first American painter since [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] (1895) to win top prize at the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomkins, Calvin. ''Off the Wall: A Portrait of Robert Rauschenberg'' [Deckle Edge] [Paperback], p. 5. Publisher: Picador; Revised and Updated edition (November 29, 2005) {{ISBN|0-312-42585-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newman-Onement 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Barnett Newman]], ''Onement 1,'' 1948. During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting.]]

[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]], wrote catalogue forewords and reviews, and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Sessions at Studio 35: "We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image."&lt;ref&gt;''Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews'', (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pp. 240–241, [[University of California Press]], 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter on April 9, 1955, "Letter to Sidney Janis: — it is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it."&lt;ref&gt;''Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews'', p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strangely the person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York Trotskyist; [[Clement Greenberg]]. As long-time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of abstract expressionism. The well-heeled artist [[Robert Motherwell]] joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.

Clement Greenberg proclaimed abstract expressionism and Jackson Pollock in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. He supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[Cézanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever-'purer' and more concentrated in what was 'essential' to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, "Art and Culture Critical essays", ("The Crisis of the Easel Picture"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.: 154–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which "what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event". "The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New'', Chapter 2, "The American Action Painter", pp.23–39&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most vocal critics of abstract expressionism at the time was ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[John Canaday]]. [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] along with Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg were important art historians of the post-war era who voiced support for abstract expressionism. During the early-to-mid-sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around abstract expressionism.

== History ==

=== World War II and the Post-War period ===

[[File:'Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental', oil on canvas painting by Richard Pousette-Dart, 1941-42, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Pousette-Dart]], ''Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental,'' 1941–42]]

During the period leading up to and during [[World War II]], modernist artists, writers, and poets, as well as important collectors and dealers, fled Europe and the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn't flee perished. Among the artists and collectors who arrived in New York during the war (some with help from [[Varian Fry]]) were [[Hans Namuth]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Peggy Guggenheim]], [[Leo Castelli]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[André Masson]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[André Breton]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Fernand Léger]], and [[Piet Mondrian]]. A few artists, notably [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Pierre Bonnard]] remained in France and survived.

The post-war period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval, with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In Paris, formerly the center of European culture and capital of the art world, the climate for art was a disaster, and New York replaced Paris as the new center of the art world. In Europe after the war there was the continuation of [[Surrealism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]], and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Outsider art|Art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L’Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949](=engl in: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] or [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]], [[Pierre Soulages]] and [[Jean Messagier]], among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/books/OL22161138M/Younger_European_painters_a_selection. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, ''Younger European painters: a selection'', exhibition catalogue, 2 December 1953 – 21 February 1954]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a new generation of American artists began to emerge and to dominate the world stage, and they were called ''Abstract Expressionists''.

==== Gorky, Hofmann, and Graham ====

[[File:Gorky-The-Liver.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arshile Gorky]], ''The Liver is the Cock's Comb'' (1944), oil on canvas, 73{{fraction|1|4}} × 98" (186 × 249 cm) [[Albright–Knox Art Gallery]], [[Buffalo, New York]]. Gorky was an [[Armenians|Armenian]]-born [[United States|American]] painter who had a seminal influence on abstract expressionism. De Kooning said: "I met a lot of artists — but then I met Gorky... He had an extraordinary gift for hitting the nail on the head; remarkable. So I immediately attached myself to him and we became very good friends."&lt;ref&gt;''Willem de Kooning'' (1969) by Thomas B. Hess&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American abstract expressionism, a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Surrealism]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Cubism]], [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America such as [[Hans Hofmann]] from Germany and [[John D. Graham]] from Ukraine. Graham's influence on American art during the early 1940s was particularly visible in the work of [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Richard Pousette-Dart]] among others. Gorky's contributions to American and world art are difficult to overestimate. His work as [[lyrical abstraction]]&lt;ref name =dorment&gt;Dorment, Richard.

Hans Hofmann in particular as teacher, mentor, and artist was both important and influential to the development and success of abstract expressionism in the United States. Among Hofmann's protégés was [[Clement Greenberg]], who became an enormously influential voice for American painting, and among his students was [[Lee Krasner]], who introduced her teacher, Hofmann, to her husband, Jackson Pollock.



==== Pollock and Abstract influences ====

During the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[Contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via [[Cubism]] and constructed sculpture, with influences as disparate as [[Navajo people|Navaho]] [[sand painting]]s, surrealism, Jungian analysis, and Mexican mural art,&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, Richard, et al., ''Introducing Postmodernism,'' Ikon Books, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 2003, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock redefined what it was to produce art. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process—the placing of unstretched raw [[canvas]] on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artist materials and industrial materials; linear skeins of paint dripped and thrown; drawing, staining, brushing; imagery and non-imagery—essentially took art-making beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art.

The other abstract expressionists followed Pollock's breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Peter Voulkos]], and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. The new [[art movements]] of the 1960s essentially followed the lead of abstract expressionism and in particular the innovations of Pollock, De Kooning, Rothko, Hofmann, Reinhardt, and Newman. The radical Anti-Formalist movements of the 1960s and 1970s including [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[Conceptual art]], and the [[feminist art movement]] can be traced to the innovations of abstract expressionism. Rereadings into abstract art, done by art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, Linda, Ch.1 in: ''Women Artists at the Millennium'' (edited by C. Armstrong and C. de Zegher) MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]]&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Griselda, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Catherine de Zegher]]&lt;ref&gt;De Zegher, Catherine, and Teicher, Hendel (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''. New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; critically shows, however, that pioneer women artists who have produced major innovations in modern art had been ignored by the official accounts of its history, but finally began to achieve long overdue recognition in the wake of the abstract expressionist movement of the 1940s and 1950s. Abstract expressionism emerged as a major art movement in New York City during the 1950s and thereafter several leading art galleries began to include the abstract expressionists in exhibitions and as regulars in their rosters. Some of those prominent 'uptown' galleries included: the [[Charles Egan Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPBPAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract&amp;dq=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-CluVdSYL4b5yASbmYCgBg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw|title=George McNeil|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sidney Janis|Sidney Janis Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0uYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=%22janis+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QypuVfDEBtKTyAS66IOQBA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22janis%20gallery%22%20abstract&amp;f=false|title=Janis Gallery abstract|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Betty Parsons Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNCJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=%22betty+parsons+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aCpuVYq4EsuxyASNjoGACA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22betty%20parsons%20gallery%22%20abstract&amp;f=false|title=The Queer Encyclopedia of the Visual Arts|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Kootz Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgALtJ2GKIUC&amp;pg=PA302&amp;dq=%22kootz+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mypuVY-QAdX_yQTHyIOoDw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kootz%20gallery%22%20abstract&amp;f=false|title=New York Modern|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tibor de Nagy Gallery]], the [[Stable Gallery]], the [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] as well as others; and several downtown galleries known at the time as the [[Tenth Street galleries]] exhibited many emerging younger artists working in the abstract expressionist vein.

==== Action painting ====

Action painting was a style widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with abstract expressionism (some critics have used the terms [[action painting]] and abstract expressionism interchangeably). A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French [[tachisme]].

The term was coined by the American critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798
| title = ''The American Action Painters''
| accessdate=August 20, 2006
| last = Rosenberg
| first = Harold
| publisher = poetrymagazines.org.uk
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of [[New York School (art)|New York School]] painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was "an arena in which to act". While abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like [[Clement Greenberg]], focused on their works' "objectness." To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them as documents of the artists' [[Existentialism|existential]] struggle.

[[File:'Boon' oil on canvas painting by James Brooks, 1957, Tate Gallery.jpg|thumb|''Boon'' by [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], 1957, [[Tate Gallery]]]]
Rosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. This spontaneous activity was the "action" of the painter, through arm and wrist movement, [[painterly]] gestures, brushstrokes, thrown paint, splashed, stained, scumbled and dripped. The painter would sometimes let the paint drip onto the canvas, while rhythmically dancing, or even standing in the canvas, sometimes letting the paint fall according to the subconscious mind, thus letting the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] part of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] assert and express itself. All this, however, is difficult to explain or interpret because it is a supposed [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] manifestation of the act of pure creation.&lt;ref&gt;based (very) loosely on a lecture by Fred Orton at the Uni of Leeds and H. Geldzahler, ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940–1970, NY 1969''&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the term abstract expressionism is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic [[action painting]]s, with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I,'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'', collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]],'' [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV,'' [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1|title=International Paintings and Sculpture - Woman V|work=nga.gov.au|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]].

Automatic writing was an important vehicle for action painters [[Franz Kline]] (in his black and white paintings), Jackson Pollock, Mark Tobey and [[Cy Twombly]], who used gesture, surface, and line to create calligraphic, linear symbols and skeins that resemble language, and resonate as powerful manifestations from the [[Collective unconscious]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://arthistoryunstuffed.com/abstract-expressionism-redefining-art-part-one/ Jeanne Willette, abstract expressionism, redefining art, part one]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/abex/hd_abex.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, Abstract Expressionism]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Robert Motherwell]] in his ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic'' series also painted powerful black and white paintings using gesture, surface and symbol evoking powerful emotional charges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/489403 Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79007 MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, other action painters, notably [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Joan Mitchell]], and [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], used imagery via either abstract landscape or as expressionistic visions of the figure to articulate their highly personal and powerful evocations. James Brooks' paintings were particularly poetic and highly prescient in relationship to [[Lyrical Abstraction]] that became prominent in the late 1960s and the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: April 5 through June 7, 1970, ''Statement of the exhibition''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both Hans Hofmann and [[Robert Motherwell]] can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and [[Color field|Color field painting]]. In the 1940s [[Richard Pousette-Dart]]'s tightly constructed imagery often depended upon themes of mythology and mysticism; as did the paintings of [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and Jackson Pollock in that decade as well.

[[Color Field painting]] initially referred to a particular type of abstract expressionism, especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and several series of paintings by [[Joan Miró]]. [[Art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from [[Action painting]]. The Color Field painters sought to rid their art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Mark Tobey]], and especially [[Ad Reinhardt]] and [[Barnett Newman]], whose masterpiece ''[[Vir heroicus sublimis]]'' is in the collection of [[MoMA]], used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery, in the case of Rothko and Gottlieb sometimes using symbol and sign as replacement of imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MoMA Learning|title=What is Abstract Expressionism: Mark Rothko|url=https://education.moma.org/moma/learningresources/cms_page/view/366521|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.

In distinction to the emotional energy and gestural surface marks of abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], the Color Field painters initially appeared to be cool and austere, effacing the individual mark in favor of large, flat areas of color, which these artists considered to be the essential nature of visual abstraction, along with the actual shape of the canvas, which later in the 1960s [[Frank Stella]] in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural abstract expressionism.

Although abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the [[San Francisco Bay area]]. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an "all-over" approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of [[Action painting]], while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the [[Color field]] painters. Younger artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s as well including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.

Although Pollock is closely associated with [[Action Painting]] because of his style, technique, and his painterly ''touch'' and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both Action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Clement Greenberg connects Pollock's allover canvasses to the large-scale [[Water Lilies]] of [[Claude Monet]] done during the 1920s. Greenberg, art critic [[Michael Fried]], and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock's most famous works – his ''drip'' paintings – read as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing, and are related to the mural-sized late Monets that are constructed of many passages of close valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as close valued fields of color and drawing that Monet used in building his picture surfaces. Pollock's use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still's case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic ''drip'' painting period of 1947–1950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery in New York City Pollock showed ''Number 12, 1952'', a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by [[Nelson Rockefeller]] for his personal collection. In 1960 the painting was severely damaged by fire in the Governors Mansion in Albany that also severely damaged an Arshile Gorky painting and several other works in the Rockefeller collection. However, by 1999 it had been restored and was installed in Albany Mall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B-QCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=1961+Fire+damages+art+collection+of++Governor+Rockefellers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Puraoeksco&amp;sig=kXNGISm1LkNM53NlzW4ZePgUlAY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=efvDTfSeMYHt0gGvjtn2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false August 16, 1976 NY Magazine, p.66] Retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp Pollock #12 1952 at NY State Mall project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313223525/http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp |date=March 13, 2014 }} Retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Arshile Gorky]] is considered to be one of the founding fathers of abstract expressionism and a [[surrealist]], he was also one of the first painters of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] who used the technique of ''staining.'' Gorky created broad fields of vivid, open, unbroken color that he used in many of his paintings as ''grounds.'' In Gorky's most effective and accomplished paintings between the years 1941–1948, he consistently used intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Another abstract expressionist whose works in the 1940s call to mind the stain paintings of the 1960s and the 1970s is [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]]. Brooks regularly used stain as a technique in his paintings from the late 1940s. Brooks began diluting his [[oil paint]] in order to have fluid colors with which to pour and drip and stain into the mostly raw canvas that he used. These works often combined [[calligraphy]] and abstract shapes. During the final three decades of his career, [[Sam Francis]]' style of large-scale bright abstract expressionism was closely associated with Color field painting. His paintings straddled both camps within the abstract expressionist rubric, [[Action painting]] and Color Field painting.

Having seen [[Jackson Pollock]]'s 1951 paintings of thinned black oil paint stained into raw canvas, [[Helen Frankenthaler]] began to produce ''stain paintings'' in varied oil colors on raw canvas in 1952. Her most famous painting from that period is ''Mountains and Sea''. She is one of the originators of the Color Field movement that emerged in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87871332 'Color Field' Artists Found a Different Way] Retrieved August 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Frankenthaler also studied with [[Hans Hofmann]].

Hofmann's paintings are a symphony of color as seen in ''The Gate,'' 1959–1960. Hofmann was renowned not only as an artist but also as a teacher of art, both in his native Germany and later in the U.S. Hans Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of [[Modernism]]. Hofmann was a young artist working in [[Paris]] who painted there before [[World War I]]. Hofmann worked in Paris with [[Robert Delaunay]], and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. Matisse's work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Hofmann was one of the first theorists of color field painting, and his theories were influential to artists and to critics, particularly to Clement Greenberg, as well as to others during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1953 [[Morris Louis]] and [[Kenneth Noland]] were both profoundly influenced by [[Helen Frankenthaler]]'s stain paintings after visiting her studio in [[New York City]]. Returning to [[Washington, DC.]], they began to produce the major works that created the ''color field movement'' in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Fenton1"&gt;Fenton, Terry.

It also was one of the first stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=De Antonio |first=Emile |title=Painters Painting, a Candid History of The Modern Art Scene 1940–1970 |page=79 |publisher=Abbeville Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-89659-418-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Carmean |first=E.

{{main|Post-painterly abstraction|Color Field painting|Lyrical Abstraction|Arte Povera|Process Art|Minimal art|Postminimalism|Western painting}}
In [[Abstract art|abstract painting]] during the 1950s and 1960s, several new directions, like the [[Hard-edge painting]] exemplified by [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]], emerged. Meanwhile, as a reaction against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism, other forms of [[Geometric abstraction]] began to appear in artist studios and in radical [[avant-garde]] circles. [[Clement Greenberg]] became the voice of ''Post-painterly abstraction;'' by curating an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964. [[Color field painting]], [[Hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp.104–113.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged as radical new directions.

== Abstract expressionism and the Cold War ==

Since the mid-1970s it has been argued by [[historical revisionism|revisionist historians]] that the style attracted the attention, in the early 1950s, of the [[CIA]], who saw it as representative of the USA as a haven of free thought and free markets, as well as a challenge to both the [[socialist realist]] styles prevalent in [[communism|communist]] nations and the dominance of the European art markets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html CIA and AbEx] Retrieved November 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The book by [[Frances Stonor Saunders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/CIAcultCW.html |title=Ratical.org |publisher=Ratical.org |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Cultural Cold War—The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/oclc/43114251?loc=#tabs |title=Worldcatlibraries.org |publisher=Worldcatlibraries.org |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (published in the UK as ''Who Paid the Piper?: CIA and the Cultural Cold War'') details how the CIA financed and organized the promotion of American abstract expressionists as part of [[cultural imperialism]] via the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] from 1950 to 1967. Notably Robert Motherwell's series ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic'' addressed some of those political issues. [[Tom Braden]], founding chief of the CIA's [[International Organizations Division]] (IOD) and ex-executive secretary of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] said in an interview, "I think it was the most important division that the agency had, and I think that it played an enormous role in the Cold War."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html Modern Art was a CIA 'Weapon'] Retrieved September 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this revisionist tradition, an essay by [[Michael Kimmelman]], chief art critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', called ''Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War'', argues that much of this information (as well as the revisionists' interpretation of it) concerning what was happening on the American art scene during the 1940s and 50s is flatly false, or at best (contrary to the revisionists' avowed historiographic principles) decontextualized.&lt;ref name=kimmelman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimmelman|first1=Michael|last2=Frascina|first2=Francis, ed.|title=Pollock and After: The Critical Debate|chapter=Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415228664|pages=294–306|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNzRUNbKKA4C&amp;pg=PA294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other books on the subject include ''Art in the Cold War'' by Christine Lindey, which also describes the art of the Soviet Union at the same time; and ''Pollock and After'' edited by Francis Frascina, which reprinted the Kimmelman article.

[[Canadians|Canadian]] painter [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] (1923–2002), a member of the Montreal-based surrealist-inspired group [[Les Automatistes]], helped introduce a related style of [[abstract impressionism]] to the Parisian art world from 1949. [[Michel Tapié]]'s groundbreaking book, ''Un Art Autre'' (1952), was also enormously influential in this regard. Tapié was also a curator and exhibition organizer who promoted the works of Pollock and Hans Hofmann in Europe. By the 1960s, the movement's initial affect had been assimilated, yet its methods and proponents remained highly influential in art, affecting profoundly the work of many artists who followed. Abstract expressionism preceded [[Tachisme]], [[Color Field painting]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Fluxus]], [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Neo-expressionism]], and the other movements of the sixties and seventies and it influenced all those later movements that evolved. Movements which were direct responses to, and rebellions against abstract expressionism began with [[Hard-edge painting]] ([[Frank Stella]], [[Robert Indiana]] and others) and [[Pop Art|Pop artists]], notably [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] who achieved prominence in the US, accompanied by [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] in Britain. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] in the US formed a bridge between abstract expressionism and Pop art. [[Minimalism]] was exemplified by artists such as [[Donald Judd]], [[Robert Mangold]] and [[Agnes Martin]].

However, many painters, such as [[Jules Olitski]], [[Joan Mitchell]] and [[Antoni Tàpies]] continued to work in the abstract expressionist style for many years, extending and expanding its visual and philosophical implications, as many abstract artists continue to do today, in styles described as [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-expressionist]] and others.

In the years after World War II, a group of New York artists started one of the first true schools of artists in America, bringing about a new era in American artwork: abstract expressionism. This led to the American art boom that brought about styles such as [[Pop Art]]. This also helped to make [[New York City|New York]] into a cultural and artistic hub.&lt;ref name="New York and Abstract Expressionism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Abstract Expressionist New York|url=http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1085?locale=en|publisher=MoMA|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''album era''' was a period in English-language popular music from the mid 1960s to the mid 2000s in which the [[album]] was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption.  It was primarily driven by three successive music recording formats, the 33{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;rpm [[LP record]], the [[Compact Cassette|audiocassette]] and the music [[Compact disc]].

==Origins==
Technological developments in the early twentieth century led to the development of the vinyl [[LP album|long-playing (LP) album]] as an important medium for recorded music. In 1948, [[Columbia Records]] began to bring out 33{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;rpm twelve-inch extended-play LPs that could play for as long as 52 minutes, or 26 minutes per side. [[Musical film]] soundtracks, jazz works, and thematic albums by singers such as [[Frank Sinatra]] quickly utilized the new longer format. However, in the 1950s and into the 1960s, 45&amp;nbsp;rpm [[seven-inch single]] sales were considered the primary market for the recorded music industry, while albums were a secondary market.  The careers of notable rock and roll performers such as [[Elvis Presley]] were driven primarily by single sales.

==1960s–1990s==
The dominance of the single as the primary medium of creative expression in music changed with the release of several albums in the 1960s, such as ''[[A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector]]'' (1963), [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965),&lt;ref name="MartinProg p 41" /&gt; [[the Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966), [[the Mothers of Invention]]'s ''[[Freak Out!]]'' (1966), and the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Julien|first=Oliver|title=Sgt. Pepper and the Beatles: It Was Forty Years Ago Today|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2013|isbn=9781409493822}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the Beatles' ''Rubber Soul'', ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and ''Sgt. Pepper'' and the Beach Boys' ''Pet Sounds'', writer [[Bill Martin (philosophy)|Bill Martin]] noted: "In the wake of these albums, many rock musicians took up the 'complete album approach.'"&lt;ref name="MartinProg p 41"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Bill|title=Listening to the Future: The Time of Progressive Rock, 1968-1978|date=1998|publisher=Open Court|location=Chicago, Ill. [u.a.]|isbn=0-8126-9368-X|pages=41|edition=1. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' assistant editor Andy Greene felt that ''Sgt. Pepper's'' "was the beginning of the album era.  It was the big bang of albums."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Kokenes. [http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/29/lennon.lyrics.auction/ "'A Day in the Life' Lyrics to be Auctioned."] [[CNN.com]]. 30 April 2010. Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Howard, writing in his book ''Sonic Alchemy'', "pop's stakes had been raised into the stratosphere" by the Beatles' ''Rubber Soul'', resulting in a shift in focus from singles to creating albums without the usual [[filler (media)|filler]] tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Howard |first=David N. |year=2004 |title=Sonic Alchemy: Visionary Music Producers and Their Maverick Recordings |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4Sk0FNXkjcC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=rubber+soul+album+without+filler#v=onepage&amp;q=rubber%20soul%20album%20without%20filler&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-634-05560-7 |p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1966, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine cited the initial US sales of ''Rubber Soul'' (1.2 million copies over nine days) as evidence of teenage record-buyers increasingly moving towards the LP format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q="Rubber+Soul"+%22nine+days%22 |author=Staff writer|title=Teen Market Is Album Market|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=18 March 2016|p=36|date=15 January 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, no singles were released from the album, which writer [[David Leaf]] says created the "perception that their new work should be viewed as a whole.&amp;nbsp;... it introduced the possibility to the recording industry that the 45&amp;nbsp;RPM disc&amp;nbsp;... preeminent for a decade&amp;nbsp;... might soon give way to a new king&amp;nbsp;... the album as a work of art."&lt;ref name="LeafPerspective"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |first=David |last=Leaf |authorlink=David Leaf |chapter=''Pet Sounds'' – Perspective |title=The Pet Sounds Sessions |others=[[The Beach Boys]] |year=1997 |publisher=[[Capitol Records]] |type=Booklet|chapter-url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Pet_Sounds_-_Perspective.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; During ''Pet Sounds''' composition and production, Beach Boys bandleader [[Brian Wilson]] found the American version of ''Rubber Soul'' to be "a collection of songs that…somehow went together like no album ever made before", which inspired Wilson to briefly shift his focus from singles to albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Stevens | first =Robert  | url =http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/oct2007/wils-o24.shtml  | title = An Evening with Brian Wilson: The Palace Theatre in Manchester, England—September&amp;nbsp;23, 2007 | publisher =wsws.org | date=October 24, 2007 | accessdate = March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The mid 1960s to the late 1970s was the era of the LP and the "golden era" of the album. According to BBC Four's ''The Golden Age'', "These were the years when the music industry exploded to become bigger than Hollywood."&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01qhn70 Synopsis of "When Albums Ruled the World."] from [[BBC Four]]'s ''The Golden Age Of The Album'' series. Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  This period, especially the 1970s, is also called the Album Rock Era.

Da Capo Press, 1999. p. 178. {{ISBN|9780306809019}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called [[Lou Gramm]]'s 1987 "[[Midnight Blue (Lou Gramm song)|Midnight Blue]]" the "last great single of the album-rock era".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Thomas Erlewine.

Along with the [[LP record]], the [[8-track tape]] was another format popular in the United States in this period. After the fall of LP record sales at the end of the 1970s and rise of first the cassette and then the CD as the dominant format for recorded music saw the end of the LP-driven "golden age" of the album, the album consolidated its domination of the recorded music market.  Seven-inch vinyl single sales were dropping and were almost totally displaced by [[cassette single]]s by the end of the 1980s.  Yet these were never as popular as seven-inch singles and they and the subsequent CD singles never amounted to a significant threat to the dominance of the album.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The primary threat to the album's primacy in the 1980s and early 1990s came from [[MTV]].  It was quickly recognized that, "after the album-rock era of the 1970s, MTV helped return the hit single to prominence as a pop marketing tool".&lt;ref name=Pareles&gt;Jon Pareles.

By the middle of the 1990s, single song delivery of music to the consumer was almost dead, at least in the United States.&lt;ref name=Leeds/&gt;  In 1998, ''Billboard'' magazine [[Billboard Hot 100#Album cuts|ended the requirement of a physical single]] for charting on its [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart after several of the year's major hits were not released as singles. But, despite the dominance of the CD, technological changes quickly turned the tables. In 1999, the internet [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] service [[Napster]] allowed internet users to easily download single songs in [[MP3]] format.  By early 2001, Napster use peaked with 26.4 million users worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Jupiter Media Metrix (July 20, 2001). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080413104420/http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?id=249 Global Napster Usage Plummets, But New File-Sharing Alternatives Gaining Ground]. Press Release.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Napster was shut down in 2001 for copyright violations, other [[music download]] services took its place.  In 2001, [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iTunes]] service was introduced and the [[iPod]], a consumer-friendly MP3 player, was released later that year.  This and other legal alternatives as well as illicit file sharing continued to depress sales of recorded music on physical formats.  By 2006, downloaded digital single sales outnumbered CD sales for the first time and buyers of digital music purchased singles over albums by a margin of 19:1.&lt;ref name=Leeds&gt;Jeff Leeds. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/26/business/media/26music.html "The Album, a Commodity in Disfavor."] ''[[The New York Times]]''. 26 March 2007. Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even music industry executives were forced to admit that the album was on its way out.  "For some genres and some artists, having an album-centric plan will be a thing of the past," [[Capitol-EMI]]'s COO Jeff Kempler said.  Other warnings were more dire.  Media researcher Aram Sinnreich bluntly predicted that "the album is going to die.  Consumers are listening to play lists" on their MP3 players.&lt;ref name=Leeds/&gt;

With consumers abandoning albums, performers "started concentrating on dishing out singles as opposed to churning out albums".&lt;ref name=Morey&gt;Tejas Morey. [http://www.mensxp.com/technology/internet/8798-how-itunes-changed-the-music-industry-forever.html "How iTunes Changed The Music Industry Forever."] ''MensXP ([[Times of India]])''. Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of the trend argued that single songs "never truly showed an artist’s true prowess and every singer or songwriter proved to be a one-hit wonder".&lt;ref name=Morey/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2787">The '''Baghdad College of Fine Arts''' (now the Institute of Fine Arts) is a faculty of the [[University of Baghdad]].

==Background==
Until the early 20th-century there was little development in the visual arts. However, in the 1930s and 40s, a group of talented local artists was sent to study in Europe by the Ministry of Culture. On their return, these artists introduced modern styles such as impressionism to the local scene. They shared their experiences and knowledge of art by opening studios, providing art tuition, organising artists's collectives and exhibitions. Most of these artists taught in the modern style. They also consciously searched for a visual language that would integrate contemporary abstract art with Iraqi traditions and themes. These artists formed the nucleus of the group that founded the College of Fine Arts and became its first Faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;Longrigg, S. and Stoakes, F., "The Social Pattern," in: Abdulla M. Lutfiyya and Charles W. Churchill (eds), ''Readings in Arab Middle Eastern Societies and Cultures,'' p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Origins==
Its origins can be traced back to the [[Baghdad Conservatory]] founded in 1936. In 1940 the range of subjects studied was expanded to include acting, directing, painting and sculpture. In the same year, the name was changed to the Institute of Fine Arts.&lt;ref name="uob"&gt;{{cite web|title=College of Fine Arts|url=http://www.en.uobaghdad.edu.iq/PageViewer.aspx?id=54|website=www.en.uobaghdad.edu.iq|publisher=University of Baghdad|accessdate=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1958 it became the Academy of Fine Arts and premises were found in [[Bab Al-Moatham]] near the [[Baghdad Medical City|Medical City Teaching Hospital]]. There was an expansion of courses available with a Department of Film and Theatre, and  Department of Paining and Sculpture.&lt;ref name="uob"/&gt;

==Brief timeline==

'''Brian O'Nolan''' ({{lang-ga|Brian Ó Nualláin}}; 5 October 1911 – 1 April 1966) was an Irish novelist, playwright and satirist, considered a major figure in twentieth century [[Irish literature]]. Born in [[Strabane]], [[County Tyrone]], he is regarded as a key figure in [[postmodern literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2011/10/flann-obrien.html |title=Celebrating Flann O'Brien |last=Kellogg |first=Carolyn |date=13 October 2011 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His English language novels, such as ''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'' and ''[[The Third Policeman]]'', were written under the [[pen name]] '''Flann O'Brien'''. His many satirical columns in ''[[The Irish Times]]'' and an Irish language novel ''[[An Béal Bocht]]'' were written under the name '''Myles na gCopaleen'''.

O'Nolan's novels have attracted a wide following for their bizarre humour and modernist [[metafiction]]. As a novelist, O'Nolan was influenced by [[James Joyce]]. He was nonetheless sceptical of the cult of Joyce which overshadows much of Irish writing, saying "I declare to God if I hear that name Joyce one more time I will surely froth at the gob."

==Biography==

===School days===
O'Nolan attended [[Blackrock College]] where he was taught English by President of the College, and future Archbishop, [[John Charles McQuaid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000029328 |first1=Sean |last1=Farragher |first2=Annraoi |last2=Wyer |title=Blackrock College 1860-1995 |location=Dublin |publisher=Paraclete Press |date=1995 |isbn=0946639191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Farragher and Wyer:

Dr McQuaid himself was recognised as an outstanding English teacher, and when one of his students, Brian O'Nolan, alias Myles na gCopaleen, boasted in his absence to the rest of the class that there were only two people in the College who could write English properly namely, Dr McQuaid and himself, they had no hesitation in agreeing. And Dr McQuaid did Myles the honour of publishing a little verse by him in the first issue of the revived College Annual (1930) – this being Myles' first published item.&lt;ref name=seamussweeney&gt;{{cite web |url=https://seamussweeney.wordpress.com/2016/05/01/flann-obriens-english-teacher-john-charles-mcquaid/ |title=Flann O'Brien's English Teacher: John Charles McQuaid |date=1 May 2016 |website=Séamus Sweeney Blog |accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem itself, "Ad Astra", read as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ah! When the skies at night
Are damascened with gold,
Methinks the endless sight
Eternity unrolled.&lt;ref name=seamussweeney /&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

O'Nolan also spent part of his schooling years in [[Synge Street CBS|Synge Street Christian Brothers School]]. His novel [[The Hard Life]], is a semi autobiographical depiction of his experience of the Christian Brothers.

===Student years===
O'Nolan wrote prodigiously during his years as a student at [[University College, Dublin]] (UCD), where he was an active, and controversial, member of the well known [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)|Literary and Historical Society]]. He contributed to the student magazine ''Comhthrom Féinne'' (''Fair Play'') under various guises, in particular the pseudonym '''Brother Barnabas'''. Significantly, he composed a story during this same period titled "Scenes in a Novel (probably posthumous) by Brother Barnabas", which anticipates many of the ideas and themes later to be found in his novel, ''At Swim-Two-Birds''. In it, the putative author of the story finds himself in riotous conflict with his characters, who are determined to follow their own paths regardless of the author's design. For example, the villain of the story, one Carruthers McDaid, intended by the author as the lowest form of scoundrel, "meant to sink slowly to absolutely the last extremities of human degradation", instead ekes out a modest living selling cats to elderly ladies and becomes a covert churchgoer without the author's consent. Meanwhile, the story's hero, Shaun Svoolish, chooses a comfortable, bourgeois life rather than romance and heroics:

:'I may be a prig', he replied, 'but I know what I like. Why can't I marry Bridie and have a shot at the Civil Service?'
:'Railway accidents are fortunately rare', I said finally, 'but when they happen they are horrible. Think it over.'

In 1934 O'Nolan and his student friends founded a short-lived magazine called ''Blather''. The writing here, though clearly bearing the marks of youthful bravado, again somewhat anticipates O'Nolan's later work, in this case his ''Cruiskeen Lawn'' column as Myles na gCopaleen:

:''Blather'' is here. As we advance to make our bow, you will look in vain for signs of servility or of any evidence of a desire to please. We are an arrogant and depraved body of men. We are as proud as bantams and as vain as peacocks.

:''Blather'' doesn't care. A sardonic laugh escapes us as we bow, cruel and cynical hounds that we are. It is a terrible laugh, the laugh of lost men. Do you get the smell of porter?

O'Nolan, who had studied German in Dublin, may have spent at least parts of 1933 and 1934 in Germany, namely in Cologne and Bonn, although details are uncertain and contested. He claimed himself, in 1965, that he "spent many months in the Rhineland and at Bonn drifting away from the strict pursuit of study." So far, no external evidence has turned up that would back up this sojourn (or an also anecdotal short-term marriage to one 'Clara Ungerland' from Cologne). In their biography Costello and van de Kamp, discussing the inconclusive evidence, state that "...it must remain a mystery, in the absence of documented evidence an area of mere speculation, representing in a way the other mysteries of life of Brian O'Nolan that still defy the researcher."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Peter |last1=Costello |first2=Peter |last2=van de Kamp |title=Flann O'Brien – An Illustrated Biography |location=London, UK |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=1987 |isbn=0-7475-0129-7 |pages=45–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil service===
A key feature of O'Nolan's personal situation was his status as an Irish government civil servant, who, as a result of his father's relatively early death, was obliged to support ten siblings, including an elder brother who was an unsuccessful writer. Given the desperate poverty of Ireland in the 1930s to 1960s, a job as a civil servant was considered prestigious, being both secure and pensionable with a reliable cash income in a largely agrarian economy. The [[Civil service of the Republic of Ireland|Irish civil service]] has been, since the [[Irish Civil War]], fairly strictly apolitical: Civil Service Regulations and the service's internal culture generally prohibit Civil Servants above the level of clerical officer from publicly expressing political views. As a practical matter, this meant that writing in newspapers on current events was, during O'Nolan's career, generally prohibited without departmental permission on an article-by-article, publication-by-publication basis. This fact alone contributed to O'Nolan's use of pseudonyms, though he had started to create character-authors even in his pre-civil service writings. O'Nolan rose to be quite senior, serving a private secretary to [[Seán T. O'Kelly]] (a minister and later President of Ireland) and [[Seán McEntee]], a powerful political figure, both of whom almost certainly knew O'Nolan was na gCopaleen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title='Could Paddy Leave off from Copying Just for Five Minutes': Brian O'Nolan and Eire's Beveridge Plan |first=Steven |last=Curran |journal=Irish University Review |volume=31 |number=2 |date=2001 |pages=353–375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, that O'Nolan was Flann O'Brien and Myles na gCopaleen was an open secret, largely disregarded by his colleagues, who found his writing very entertaining; this was a function of the makeup of the civil service, which recruited leading graduates by competitive examination—it was an erudite and relatively liberal body in the Ireland of the 1930s to the 1970s. Nonetheless, had O'Nolan forced the issue, by using one of his known pseudonyms or his own name for an article that seriously upset politicians, consequences would likely have followed—hence the acute pseudonym problem in attributing his work today. He was, indeed, forced to retire from the civil service in 1953.&lt;ref name=fotoole_fantastic_oct2011&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/the-fantastic-flann-o-brien-1.611390 |title=The Fantastic Flann O'Brien |first=Fintan |last=O'Toole |date=1 October 2011 |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A combination of his gradually deepening alcoholism and his habit of making derogatory remarks about senior politicians in his newspaper columns led to his forced retirement from the civil service in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/an-irishman-s-diary-1.763600 |title=An Irishman's Diary |first=Frank |last=McNally |date=14 May 2009 |newspaper=The Irish Times |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He departed, recalled a colleague, "in a final fanfare of f***s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Phelan |title=A Watcher in the Wings: A Lingering Look at Myles na gCopaleen |journal=Administration |location=Dublin |publisher=[[Institute of Public Administration of Ireland]] |volume=24 |number=2 |date=1976 |pages=96–106 |issn=0001-8325}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Personal life===
Although O'Nolan was a well known character in Dublin during his lifetime, relatively little is known about his personal life. He joined the Irish civil service in 1935, working in the Department of Local Government. From the time of his father's death in 1937, he supported his brothers and sisters, eleven in total, on his income.&lt;ref name=monuallain_brother_oct2011/&gt; On 2 December 1948 he married Evelyn McDonnell, a typist in the Department of Local Government. On his marriage he moved from his parental home in Blackrock to nearby Merrion Avenue, living at several further locations in [[South Dublin]] before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/o/OBrien_F/life.htm |title=Flann O'Brien (1911-66) |website=Ricorso |accessdate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had no children.

===Health and death===
[[File:065 flann obrien grab.jpg|thumb|Grave of Brian O'Nolan/Brian Ó Nualláin, his parents and his wife, [[Deans Grange Cemetery]], Dublin]]
O'Nolan was an alcoholic for much of his life and suffered from ill health in his later years.&lt;ref name="Gale1996"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Gale |editor-first=Steven H. |title=O'Nolan, Brian |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of British Humorists: Geoffrey Chaucer to John Cleese |volume=Vol.2 (L-W) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5cSkSB13ZQcC&amp;pg=PA798&amp;lpg=PA798&amp;dq=brian+o'nolan+evelyn+1966#PPA799,M1 |date=1996 |publisher=[[Garland Publishing|Garland]] |location=New York/London |isbn=978-0-8240-5990-3 |page=798 |accessdate=13 October 2009 |via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suffered from cancer of the throat and died from a heart attack on the morning of 1 April 1966.&lt;ref name=monuallain_brother_oct2011&gt;{{cite news |first=Micheál |last=Ó Nualláin |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1001/1224305062293.html |title=The Brother: memories of Brian |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |publisher=Irish Times Trust |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=1 October 2011 |quote=In 1966 Brian was undergoing X-ray treatment for throat cancer.

==Journalism==
As Myles na gCopaleen (or Myles na Gopaleen), O'Nolan wrote short columns for ''[[The Irish Times]]'', mostly in English but also in Irish, which showed a manic imagination that still astonishes.

His newspaper column, "Cruiskeen Lawn" (transliterated from the Irish ''crúiscín lán'', "full/brimming small-jug"), has its origins in a series of pseudonymous letters written to ''[[The Irish Times]]'', originally intended to mock the publication in that same newspaper of a poem, "Spraying the Potatoes", by the writer [[Patrick Kavanagh]]:

{{cquote|I am no judge of poetry — the only poem I ever wrote was produced when I was body and soul in the gilded harness of Dame Laudanum — but I think Mr Kavanaugh [sic] is on the right track here. Perhaps the ''Irish Times'', timeless champion of our peasantry, will oblige us with a series in this strain covering such rural complexities as inflamed goat-udders, warble-pocked shorthorn, contagious abortion, non-ovoid oviducts and nervous disorders among the gentlemen who pay the rent.}}

The letters, some written by O'Nolan and some not, continued under a variety of false names, using various styles and assaulting varied topics, including other letters by the same authors. The letters were a hit with the readers of ''The Irish Times'', and [[R. M. Smyllie]], then editor of the newspaper, shortly invited O'Nolan to contribute a column. Importantly, the Irish Times maintained that there were in fact three pseudonymous authors of the Cruiskeen Lawn column, which provided a certain amount of cover for O'Nolan as a civil servant when a column was particularly provocative.

The first column appeared on 4 October 1940, under the pseudonym "An Broc" ("The Badger"). In all subsequent columns the name "Myles na gCopaleen" ("Myles of the Little Horses" or "Myles of the Ponies" - a name taken from The Collegians, a novel by [[Gerald Griffin]]) was used. Initially, the column was composed in Irish, but soon English was used primarily, with occasional smatterings of German, French or Latin. The sometimes intensely satirical column's targets included the Dublin literary elite, Irish language revivalists, the Irish government, and the "Plain People of Ireland." The following column excerpt, in which the author wistfully recalls a brief sojourn in Germany as a student, illustrates the biting humor and scorn that informed the ''Cruiskeen Lawn'' writings:

{{cquote|I notice these days that the Green Isle is getting greener. Delightful ulcerations resembling buds pit the branches of our trees, clumpy daffodils can be seen on the upland lawn. Spring is coming and every decent girl is thinking of that new Spring costume. Time will run on smoother till Favonius re-inspire the frozen Meade and clothe in fresh attire the lily and rose that have not sown nor spun. Curse it, my mind races back to my Heidelberg days. Sonya and Lili. And Magda. And Ernst Schmutz, Georg Geier, Theodor Winkleman, [[Efrem Zimbalist]], Otto Grün. And the accordion player Kurt Schachmann. And Doktor Oreille, descendant of Irish princes. Ich hab' mein Herz/ in Heidelberg verloren/ in einer lauen/ Sommernacht/ Ich war verliebt/ bis über beide/ Ohren/ und wie ein Röslein/hatt'/ Ihr Mund gelächt or something humpty tumpty tumpty tumpty tumpty mein Herz it schlägt am Neckarstrand. A very beautiful student melody. Beer and music and midnight swims in the Neckar. Chats in erse with [[Kuno Meyer|Kun O'Meyer]] and John Marquess ... Alas, those chimes. Und als wir nahmen/ Abschied vor den Toren/ beim letzten Küss, da hab' Ich Klar erkannt/ dass Ich mein Herz/ in Heidelberg verloren/ MEIN HERZ/ es schlägt am Neck-ar-strand! Tumpty tumpty tum.

:''The Plain People of Ireland:'' Isn't the German very like the Irish? Very guttural and so on?

:''Myself:'' Yes.

:''The Plain People of Ireland:'' People say that the German language and the Irish language is very guttural tongues.

:''Myself:'' Yes.

:''The Plain People of Ireland:'' The sounds is all guttural do you understand.

:''Myself.'' Yes.

:''The Plain People of Ireland:'' Very guttural languages the pair of them the Gaelic and the German.}}

Ó Nuallain/na gCopaleen wrote ''Cruiskeen Lawn'' for ''The Irish Times'' until the year of his death, 1966.

He contributed substantially to ''[[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art|Envoy]]'' (he was "honorary editor" for the special number featuring James Joyce&lt;ref&gt;'In 1951, whilst I was editor of the Irish literary periodical Envoy, I decided that it would be a fitting thing to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of James Joyce by bringing out a special number dedicated to him which would reflect the attitudes and opinions of his fellow countrymen towards their illustrious compatriot. To this end I began by inviting Brian Nolan to act as honorary editor for this particular issue. His own genius closely matched, without in any way resembling or attempting to counterfeit, Joyce's. But if the mantle of Joyce (or should we say the waistcoat?) were ever to be passed on, nobody would be half so deserving of it as the man whom under his other guises as Flan [sic] O'Brien and Myles Na gCopaleen, proved himself incontestably to be the most creative writer and mordant wit that Ireland had given us since Shem the Penman himself.' – [[John Ryan (Dublin artist)|John Ryan]], Introduction to ''A Bash in the Tunnel'' (1970) [http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/r/Ryan_J2/life.htm John Ryan (1925–92) Ricorso]&lt;/ref&gt;) and formed part of the ''Envoy'' / McDaid's pub circle of artistic and literary figures that included [[Patrick Kavanagh]], [[Anthony Cronin]], [[Brendan Behan]], [[John Jordan (poet)|John Jordan]], [[Pearse Hutchinson]], [[J.P. Donleavy]] and artist [[Desmond MacNamara]] who, at the author's request, created the book cover for the first edition of ''The Dalkey Archive''. O'Nolan also contributed to ''[[The Bell (magazine)|The Bell]]''. He also wrote a column titled ''Bones of Contention'' for the ''[[Nationalist and Leinster Times]]'' under the pseudonym George Knowall; those were collected in the volume ''Myles Away From Dublin''.

Most of his later writings were occasional pieces published in periodicals, which explains why his work has only recently come to enjoy the considered attention of literary scholars. O'Nolan was notorious for his prolific use and creation of pseudonyms for much of his writing, including short stories, essays, and letters to editors, which has rendered the compilation of a complete bibliography of his writings an almost impossible task. He allegedly would write letters to the editor of ''The Irish Times'' complaining about his own articles published in that newspaper, for example in his regular ''Cruiskeen Lawn'' column, or irate, eccentric and even mildly deranged pseudonymous responses to his own pseudonymous letters, which gave rise to rampant speculation as to whether the author of a published letter existed or not. Not surprisingly, little of O'Nolan's pseudonymous activity has been verified.

==Etymology==
O'Nolan's journalistic pseudonym is taken from a character (Myles-na-Coppaleen) in [[Dion Boucicault]]'s play ''[[The Colleen Bawn]]'' (itself an adaptation of Gerald Griffin's ''The Collegians''), who is the stereotypical charming Irish rogue. At one point in the play, he sings the ancient anthem of the Irish Brigades on the Continent, the song "An Crúiscín Lán" (hence the name of the column in the ''Irish Times'').

''Capall'' is the Irish word for "horse" (from [[Vulgar Latin]] ''caballus''), and 'een' (spelled ''ín'' in Irish) is a diminutive suffix. The prefix ''na gCapaillín'' is the genitive plural in his [[Ulster Irish]] dialect (the Standard Irish would be "Myles na gCapaillíní"), so Myles na gCopaleen means "Myles of the Little Horses". ''Capaillín'' is also the Irish word for "[[pony]]", as in the name of Ireland's most famous and ancient native horse breed, the [[Connemara pony]].

O'Nolan himself always insisted on the translation "Myles of the Ponies", saying that he did not see why the principality of the pony should be subjugated to the imperialism of the horse.

==Fiction==

===''At Swim-Two-Birds''===
{{main|At Swim-Two-Birds}}
''At Swim-Two-Birds'' works entirely with borrowed (and stolen) characters from other fiction and legend, on the grounds that there are already far too many existing fictional characters.

''At Swim-Two-Birds'' is now recognised as one of the most significant [[modernist novel]]s before 1945. Indeed it can be seen as a pioneer of [[postmodernism]], although the academic [[Keith Hopper]] has argued that ''The Third Policeman'', superficially less radical, is actually a more deeply subversive and proto-postmodernist work, and as such, possibly a representation of [[literary nonsense]].

''At Swim-Two-Birds'' was one of the last books that [[James Joyce]] read and he praised it to O'Nolan's friends—praise which was subsequently used for years as a blurb on reprints of O'Brien's novels. The book was also praised by [[Graham Greene]], who was working as a reader when the book was put forward for publication and also the Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]], whose work might be said to bear some similarities to that of O'Brien.

The British writer [[Anthony Burgess]] stated, "If we don't cherish the work of Flann O'Brien we are stupid fools who don't deserve to have great men. Flann O'Brien is a very great man." Burgess included ''At Swim-Two-Birds'' on his list of ''[[Ninety-nine Novels|Ninety-Nine Novels: The Best in English since 1939]]''.

''At Swim-Two-Birds'' has had a troubled publication history in the USA. [[Southern Illinois University Press]] has set up a Flann O'Brien Center and begun publishing all of O'Nolan's works. Consequently, academic attention to the novel has increased.

===''The Third Policeman'' and ''The Dalkey Archive''===
{{main|The Third Policeman|The Dalkey Archive}}
The rejection of ''The Third Policeman'' by publishers in his lifetime had a profound effect on O'Nolan. This is perhaps reflected in ''The Dalkey Archive'', in which sections of ''The Third Policeman'' are recycled almost word for word, namely the atomic theory and the character [[De Selby]].

''The Third Policeman'' has a fantastic plot of a murderous protagonist let loose on a strange world peopled by fat policemen, played against a satire of academic debate on an eccentric philosopher called De Selby. Sergeant Pluck introduces the atomic theory of the bicycle.

''The Dalkey Archive'' features a character who encounters a penitent, elderly and apparently unbalanced [[James Joyce]] (who dismissively refers to his work by saying 'I have published little' and, furthermore, does not seem aware of having written and published ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'') working as an assistant barman or 'curate'—another small joke relating to Joyce's alleged priestly ambitions—in the resort of Skerries. The scientist De Selby seeks to suck all of the air out of the world, and Policeman Pluck learns of the mollycule theory from Sergeant Fottrell. ''The Dalkey Archive'' was adapted for the stage in September 1965 by [[Hugh Leonard]] as ''The Saints Go Cycling In''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishplayography.com/play.aspx?playid=31428 |title=The Saints Go Cycling In |website=Playography Ireland |publisher=Irish Theatre Institute |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other fiction===
Other books written by O'Nolan include ''[[An Béal Bocht]]''—translated from the Irish as ''The Poor Mouth''—(a parody of [[Tomás Ó Criomhthain]]'s autobiography ''[[An t-Oileánach]]''—in English ''The Islander''), and ''[[The Hard Life]]'' (a fictional autobiography meant to be his "misterpiece").

O'Nolan's theatrical output was unsuccessful. ''Faustus Kelly'', a play about a local councillor selling his soul to the devil for a seat in the Dáil, ran for only 11 performances in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n20/jonathan-coe/clutching-at-railings |title=Clutching at Railings |last=Coe |first=Jonathan |journal=[[London Review of Books]] |volume=35 |number=20 |date=24 October 2013 |pages=21–22 |accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second play, ''Rhapsody in Stephen's Green'', also called ''The Insect Play'', was a reworking of the [[Brothers Čapek|Capek Brothers']] [[Pictures from the Insects' Life|synonymous play]] using anthropomorphised insects to satirise society. It also was put on in 1943 but quickly folded, possibly because of the offence it gave to various interests including Catholics, Ulster Protestants, Irish civil servants, Corkmen, and the [[Fianna Fáil|Fianna Fail]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lilliputpress.ie/product/rhapsody-in-stephens-greenthe-insect-play |title=Rhapsody in Stephens Green &amp; The Insect Play |website=[[The Lilliput Press]] |access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was thought lost, but was rediscovered in 1994 in the archives of [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1994/nov/17/news |title=From the dung heap of history |first=Peter |last=Lennon |date=17 November 1994 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, O'Nolan was co-producer of a production for [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], the Irish broadcaster, of ''3 Radio Ballets'', which was just what it said it was—a dance performance in three parts designed for and performed on radio.

==Legacy==
[[File:ONolan plaque, Strabane (02), January 2010.JPG|thumb|right|Blue plaque for O'Nolan at Bowling Green, [[Strabane]]]]

O'Brien influenced the science fiction writer and conspiracy theory satirist [[Robert Anton Wilson]], who has O'Brien's character De Selby, an obscure intellectual in ''The Third Policeman'' and ''The Dalkey Archive'', appear in his own ''[[The Widow's Son]]''. In both ''The Third Policeman'' and ''The Widow's Son'', De Selby is the subject of long pseudo-scholarly footnotes. This is fitting, because O'Brien himself made free use of characters invented by other writers, claiming that there were too many fictional characters as is. O'Brien was also known for pulling the reader's leg by concocting elaborate conspiracy theories.

In 2011 the '100 Myles: The International Flann O'Brien Centenary Conference' (24–27 July) was held at The Department of English Studies at the University of Vienna, the success of which led to the establishment of 'The International Flann O'Brien Society'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.univie.ac.at/flannobrien2011/IFOBS.html |title=The International Flann O'Brien Society |date=2011 |website=University of Vienna |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, Trinity College Dublin hosted a weekend of events celebrating the centenary of his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1015/1224305837854.html |last=Nihill |first=Cian |title=Trinity celebrates Flann O'Brien centenary |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commemorative 55c stamp featuring a portrait of O'Nolan's head as drawn by his brother Micheál Ó Nualláin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2011/1008/1224305446547.html |title=Seven Days |newspaper=The Irish Times |date=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was issued for the same occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/1004/breaking38.html |title=Writer O'Nolan honoured by stamp |date=4 October 2011 |newspaper=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/republic-of-ireland/stamp-of-approval-on-flann-obriens-centenary-16059202.html |title=Stamp of approval on Flann O'Brien's centenary |last=Sweeney |first=Ken |date=5 October 2011 |newspaper=[[The Belfast Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/05/flann-obrien-loveable-literary-genius |title=Flann O'Brien: lovable literary genius |last=McManus |first=Darragh |date=5 October 2011 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred some 52 years after the writer's famous criticism of the Irish postal service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1005/1224305259131.html |title=An Post gets the message, gives Myles a stamp |last=McNally |first=Frank |date=5 October 2011 |newspaper=The Irish Times |quote=In the course of the 1959 diatribe, he decried the low aesthetic standards of Irish philately and, calling for a better class of artist to be hired, suggested future stamps might also capture more realistic scenes from Irish life, such as "a [[Fianna Fáil|Feena Fayl]] big shot fixing a job for a relative.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bronze sculpture of the writer stands outside the Palace Bar on Dublin's Fleet Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1006/1224305331078.html |title=Palace of inspiration: Sculptures of writers unveiled |last=Nihill |first=Cian |date=6 October 2011 |newspaper=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Myers]] said, "Had Myles escaped he might have become a literary giant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/kevin-myers-had-myles-escaped-he-might-have-become-a-literary-giant-2892746.html |title=Had Myles escaped he might have become a literary giant |last=Myers |first=Kevin |date=30 September 2011 |newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fintan O'Toole]] said of O'Nolan "he could have been a celebrated national treasure – but he was far too radical for that."&lt;ref name=fotoole_fantastic_oct2011/&gt; An award winning radio play by [[Albrecht Behmel]] called ''[[Ist das Ihr Fahrrad, Mr. O'Brien?]]'' brought his life and work to the attention of a broader German audience in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darstellendekuenste.de/id-2003.html |title=Hörspiel des Monats/Jahres 2003 |website=Akademie der Darstellenden Künste |language=de |accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Nolan has also been semi-seriously referred to as a "scientific prophet" in relation to his writings on [[thermodynamics]], [[quaternion]] theory and [[atomic theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/1017/1224305920174.html |title=Trinity plays host to Flann 100 as admirers celebrate comic genius |last=Keating |first=Sara |date=17 October 2011 |newspaper=The Irish Times |quote=In a twist of Mylesian absurdity, however, the highlight of the day's cultural programme proved to be a science lecture by Prof Dermot Diamond, in which Diamond convincingly argued that O'Brien was not just a literary genius but a scientific prophet.

In 2012, on the 101st anniversary of his birth, O'Nolan was honoured with a commemorative [[Google Doodle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/new-media/item/29543-google-celebrates-irish/ |title=Google celebrates Irish author Brian O'Nolan in doodle today |first=Carmel |last=Doyle |date=5 October 2012 |website=Silicon Republic |accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyedge.ie/google-doodle-irish-623199-Oct2012/ |title=Who's that Irish person in today's Google Doodle? |date=5 October 2012 |website=[[The Daily Edge]] |quote=It would have been Irish writer Flann O'Brien's (aka Brian O'Nolan) 101st birthday today.

National Museums of Scotland. Retrieved 22 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Carved stone balls''' are [[petrosphere]]s dated from the late [[Neolithic]] to possibly as late as the [[Iron Age]] mainly found in [[Scotland]], but also elsewhere in Britain and Ireland. They are usually round and rarely oval, and of fairly uniform size at around 2.75 inches or 7&amp;nbsp;cm across, with 3 to 160 protruding knobs on the surface. They range from having no ornamentation (apart from the knobs) to extensive and highly varied engraved patterns.&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;Marshall, D. N. (1976/77). "Carved Stone Balls". ''Proc Soc Antiq Scot'', 108, Pp. 4–72.&lt;/ref&gt;  A wide range of theories have been produced to explain their use or significance, without any one gaining very wide acceptance.

They are not to be confused with the much larger smooth round [[stone spheres of Costa Rica]].

==Age and distribution==
Carved stone balls are up to 5200 years old, coming from the late Neolithic to at least the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name="ashmolean.org"&gt;http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/britarch/highlights/stone-balls.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all have been found in north-east Scotland, the majority in [[Aberdeenshire]], the fertile land lying to the east of the [[Grampian Mountains]]. A similar distribution to that of [[Pict]]ish symbols led to the early suggestion that carved stone balls are Pictish artefacts.&lt;ref name="Marshall55"&gt;Marshall, D.N. (1976/77). Carved Stone Balls. Proc Soc Antiq Scot, 108, P. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The core distribution also reflects that of the [[Recumbent stone circles]]. As objects they are very easy to transport and a few have been found on [[Iona]], [[Skye]], [[Harris, Scotland|Harris]], [[Uist]], [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Hawick]], [[Wigtownshire]] and fifteen from [[Orkney]]. Outside Scotland examples have been found in [[Ireland]] at [[Ballymena]], and in England at [[Durham, England|Durham]], [[Cumbria]], [[Lowick, Northumberland|Lowick]] and [[Bridlington]]. The larger (90mm diameter) balls are all from Aberdeenshire, bar one from [[Newburgh, Fife|Newburgh in Fife]].

By the late 1970s a total of 387 had been recorded.&lt;ref name="Marshall55"/&gt; Of these, by far the greatest concentration (169) was found in Aberdeenshire. By 1983 the number had risen to 411.&lt;ref name="Marshall83"&gt;Marshall, D. N. (1983). "Further notes on Carved Stone Balls". ''Proc Soc Antiq Scot'', 113, pp. 628-646.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2015 a total of over 425 balls were recorded.&lt;ref name="ashmolean.org"/&gt; A collection of over 30 carved balls from Scotland, Ireland and northern England is in the [[British Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=ball+neolithic British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological context==
Many of the balls have not had their discovery site recorded and most are found as a result of agricultural activity. Five were found at [[Skara Brae]] village and one at the [[Dunadd]] hillfort. The distribution of the balls is similar to that of mace-heads, which were both weapons and prestige objects used in ceremonial situations.&lt;ref name="Marshall63"&gt;Marshall, D.N. (1976/77). Carved Stone Balls. Proc Soc Antiq Scot, 108, P. 62 – 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of context is likely to distort the interpretation. Random finds are only likely to have been picked up and entered a collection if they were aesthetically appealing. Damaged and plain balls were less likely to find a market than decorated examples so some more decorated examples might be fraudulent.

In 2013, archaeologists discovered a carved stone ball at [[Ness of Brodgar]], a rare find of such an object ''in situ'' in "a modern archaeological context".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/archaeology/nessofbrodgar/2013/08/dig-diary-wednesday-august-7-2013/ "Dig Diary — Wednesday, August 7, 2013"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325001901/http://www.orkneyjar.com/archaeology/nessofbrodgar/2013/08/dig-diary-wednesday-august-7-2013/# |date=25 March 2014 }}. Orkneyjar. Retrieved 10 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical characteristics==

=== Materials ===
[[File:Room 51, British MuseumDSCF6621.jpg|thumb|left|Another example]]
Many are said to be made of "[[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]]", but this is a general term for all varieties of dark, greenish igneous rocks, including [[diorites]], [[serpentinite]], and altered [[basalt]]s.  Forty-three are sandstone, including Old Red Sandstone, 26 greenstone and 12 [[quartzite]]. Nine were [[serpentinite]] and these had been carved. Some were made of [[gabbro]], a difficult material to carve. Round and oval natural shaped sandstones are sometimes found. Examples made from Hornblende [[gneiss]] and granitic gneiss were noted, both very difficult stone to work. Granitic rocks were also used and the famous Towie example may be serpentinised [[picrite]]. The highly ornamented examples were mainly made of sandstone or serpentine.&lt;ref name="Marshall54"&gt;Marshall, D.N. (1976/77). Carved Stone Balls. Proc Soc Antiq Scot, 108, P. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; A significant number have not as yet been fully inspected or tested to ascertain their composition.

===Experimental archaeology===
Using authentic manufacturing techniques (pecking and grinding), full replicas have been made by Andrew T. Young, a researcher at the University of Exeter. It was shown that they could be made using prehistoric technology with no recourse to the use of metal tools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eprofile.exeter.ac.uk/andrewyoung/?section=2 University of Exter, The Ground Stone Tools of Britain and Ireland: an Experimental Approach von Andrew T. Young], retrieved 30. August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size, shape and knobs===
Of the 387 carved stone balls known in 1976 (now about 425), 375 are about 70&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, but twelve are known with diameters of 90 to 114&amp;nbsp;mm. Only 7 are oval. They are therefore about the size of tennis balls or oranges.

Nearly half have 6 knobs, 3 have 3 knobs, 43 have 4 knobs, 3 have 5 knobs, 18 have 7 knobs, 9 have 8 knobs, 3 have 9 knobs, 52 have between 10 and 55 knobs and finally 14 have between 70 and 160 knobs.

===Ornamentation===
[[File:Human Prehistory in the Kelvingrove carved stone ball Aberdeenshire.JPG|thumb|A Carved stone ball with low-profile knobs]]
The decoration used falls into three categories, those with spirals, those with concentric circles and those with patterns of straight incised lines and hatchings. More than one design is used on the same ball and the standard of artwork varies from the extremely crude to the highly expert which only an exceptionally skilled craftsman could have produced. Some balls have designs on the interspaces between the knobs which must be significant in the context of the speculated use of these artefacts.
Twenty-six of the six-knobbed balls are decorated. The Orkney examples are unusual, being either all ornamented or otherwise unusual in appearance, such as the lack, bar one example, of the frequently found six-knobbed type. Metal may have been used to work some of the designs.

The Towie ball has some design similarities with the carvings on the [[Folkton Drums]]. These were found in a [[tumulus]] in England and are made of [[chalk]] with elaborate carvings, amongst which are distinct [[oculi]] or eyes.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;Powell, T. G. E. (1966). ''Prehistoric Art''. Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-20046-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentric carved lines on stone balls appear to be stylised oculi. This ball also has a roughly triangular arrangement of three dots in an interspace between the knobs.  This appears to be identical to the arrangement of dots found on the Parkhill silver chain terminal ring, found near Aberdeen, a Pictish artefact. It is possible that the dots represent a name, as some of the Pictish symbols at least are thought to represent personal names.&lt;ref name="Cummins"&gt;Cummins, W. A. (1999). The Picts and their Symbols. Sutton Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7509-2207-9}}. P. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spirals or plastic ornament which is similar to Grooved Ware is found on the Aberdeenshire examples, this being a type of late Neolithic pottery not known in the north-east but common in Orkney and Fife. The [[New Grange]] carvings in Ireland show strong similarities to those found on some balls. A continuous spiral is found on one and elements of chevrons, zig-zags and concentric triangles are also found, stimulating comparisons with [[petrosomatoglyph]] symbolism. Mostly the different knobs have different or sometimes no ornamentation. A 'golf-ball' variety of ornamentation is found on a few balls. The carving does not appear to have any practical purpose in general, however it has been suggested that one type, with very distinct knobs, was used for processing copper ores (see under 'Function'). Some of the bold triangles and criss-cross incisions seem to be more Iron Age in character than Neolithic or Bronze Age.&lt;ref name="Marshall62b"&gt;Marshall, D. N. (1976/77). Carved Stone Balls. Proc Soc Antiq Scot, 108, P. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
[[File:Human Prehistory in the Kelvingrove carved stone ball Turriff.JPG|thumb|left|Glasgow example]]

Some of the balls have grooves or interspaces between the knobs into which leather could be tied so as to make a device such as a [[bolas]]. Their use as weapons was suggested by many researchers but in recent years this idea has fallen from favour.

One suggestion saw the balls as movable poises on a primitive weighing machine, following the logic of the remarkable uniformity in size shown by a good number of these carefully made objects. However, it has been shown that their weights vary so considerably that mathematically they could not be considered part of a system of weight measurement.

'Sink stones' found in Denmark and Ireland have some slight similarities, these artefacts being used in conjunction with fishing nets.&lt;ref name="Evans10"&gt;Evans, Sir John (1897). The Ancient Stone Implements, weapons and ornaments of Great Britain. Pub. Longmans, Green &amp; Co. 2nd Edition. P. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

The possible use of the balls as [[oracle]]s has been suggested. The way in which the ball came to rest could be interpreted as a message from the gods or an answer to a question. The lack of balls found in graves may indicate that they were not considered to belong to individuals.

An alternative or supplementary use could have been as the 'right to speak' where discussions are controlled by the requirement for the speaker to hold the carved stone ball or if not, then keep his or her peace and listen to the views of others. The balls are of a size that fits comfortably in one hand.

Another possible use for the stones would be in the working of hides.  Into the 20th century leatherworkers polished leather, parchment, and hides, by tying the skins to a frame using a ball at each corner of the hide then rubbing down material being worked with stones.  The corners of the hides were wrapped around the balls which allowed the bindings to hold fast without slipping off.  In more modern times, the balls were often made from scraps of the material being worked and the leather was cut away from the balls when the polishing was finished.  This caused the balls to grow in size until the process had to be started over by replacing the oversized balls with scraps and beginning a new ball.

Balls of plain sandstone with the facets from shaping still clearly visible were found at [[Traprain Law]] in [[East Lothian]]. A significant number have already been found here and are known from other southern Scottish Iron Age sites. They may date from the fourth to third centuries BC. These balls are not ornamented and do not have knobs.&lt;ref name="Rees and Hunter"&gt;Rees, Thomas &amp; Hunter, Fraser (2000). Archaeological excavation of a medieval structure and an assemblage of prehistoric artefacts from the summit of Traprain Law, East Lothian. 1996 - 7. PSAS 130, P. 413 - 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Megalith construction aid===
[[File:Human Prehistory in the Kelvingrove carved stone ball Alford.JPG|thumb|Another in Glasgow]]
A theory on the movement of 'monument stones' has been put forward as a result of an observed correlation between standing stone circles in Aberdeenshire, Scotland and a concentration of carved stone balls, and it is suggested that these [[petrosphere]]s may have been used to help transport the big stones by functioning like [[ball bearing]]s.

Many of the late Neolithic stone balls have diameters differing by only a millimetre. The discovery of this led to the suggestion that they might have been meant to be used together. By plotting the find sites on a map it can be demonstrated that often these petrospheres were located in the vicinity of Neolithic recumbent stone circles. Models using small wooden balls placed in a groove in parallel longitudinal pieces of wood 'sleepers' with a carrying board above have shown such megalith transport to be practical in some situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Discovering the Secrets of Stonehenge|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101130010931.htm|accessdate=8 July 2011|newspaper=Science Daily|date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platonic solids==
The carved stone balls have been taken as evidence of knowledge of the five [[Platonic solids]] a millennium before Plato described them. Indeed, some of them exhibit the symmetries of Platonic solids, but the extent of this and how much it depends on mathematical understanding is disputed, as configurations resembling the solids can naturally arise when placing knobs around a sphere.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} There does not appear to be much special attention given to the Platonic solid arrangements over less symmetrical arrangements of knobs over the balls, and some of the five solids do not appear.{{sfn|Lloyd|2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hart|first=George|title=Neolithic Carved Stone Polyhedra|url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/neolithic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Coast Scene, Isles of Shoals''''' is a 1901 painting by [[Childe Hassam]] which is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11032?sortBy=Relevance&amp;amp;ft=Childe+Hassam&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;rpp=100&amp;amp;pos=61|title=www.metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Done in oil on canvas in luminous colours, the painting depicts the remote Isles of Shoals off the rocky shoreline of [[New England]], a favourite haunt of Childe Hassam at the end of the 19th century and where he painted a series of similar coastal scenes.

The painting is accompanied at the Metropolitan Museum of Art by ''[[Surf, Isles of Shoals]]'', a similar work by Hassam.

The work is currently (2018) not on view.

The '''East Market District''', colloquially referred to as '''NuLu''' (a [[portmanteau]] of "New" and "Louisville"),&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/travel/14COMart.html?_r=0|title=Louisville Neighborhood Becomes an Arts Area|date=September 9, 2008 | work=The New York Times|first=Hilary|last=Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="courier-journal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071102/OPINION06/71101057/1082/OPINION |title=Lunch With...Gill Holland |publisher=Courier-Journal |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an unofficial district of [[Louisville, Kentucky]], situated along Market Street between [[downtown Louisville|downtown]] to the west and the [[The Highlands, Louisville|Highlands]] neighborhoods to the east.  A growing, hip district, the area comprises parts of two of Louisville's oldest neighborhoods, [[Butchertown, Louisville|Butchertown]] and [[Phoenix Hill]]. The district is home to schools, churches, large and small businesses and some of the city's oldest homes and businesses. A destination since Louisville's founding, Market Street has played host to a variety of businesses throughout the city's history that have drawn Louisvillians for generations to its addresses.

The district is today well known for its galleries showcasing local, regional and national artists, unique specialty stores, antique shops and a growing number of upscale restaurants. While multiple art galleries are located in Louisville, they are especially concentrated in this district. Keeping with the sustainable culture of NuLu, many of its restaurants offer organic and locally sourced ingredients. The district also houses numerous architecture firms, antique stores, advertising and media agencies, a record label, film production group, publishing company, designers and more.

==History and architecture==
{{See also|History of Louisville, Kentucky}}

The area that is now NuLu was originally part of a {{convert|1000|acre|km2|adj=on}} Royal land grant to Col. [[William Preston (Virginia)|William Preston]] for his service during the [[French and Indian War]]. In 1827, the area was annexed by the city of Louisville under the name of "Uptown". Around 1832, Market Street's eastern terminus was occupied by the Woodland Gardens, a green oasis of amusement and entertainment in the growing city that became a favorite gathering spot with  [[History of the Germans in Louisville|German immigrants]].  The gardens themselves gave way to the [[Bourbon Stockyards]] when it closed in 1880, which helped fuel early growth of meat purveyors, tanners and other industries associated with the livestock trade, including the establishment of five Market Houses that populated the street. Two of these could be found in today's East Market District: the Shelby Market, between Campbell and Shelby Streets, and the Preston Market between Preston and Floyd Streets. 

From the early 1960s until the early 2000s, ten buildings on the 800 block of East Market area were owned by Wayside Christian Mission and used as the main housing campus for homeless women and families (men are still housed at a location on Jefferson Street). Eventually businesses in the area, led by antiques dealer Joe Ley, put pressure on the homeless shelter by opening a hearing process for Wayside's buildings to be added to the historic register, forcing Wayside to halt necessary renovations to its buildings. After months of stalled construction, Wayside Christian Mission sold its Market Street property and moved to a new location at 2nd and Broadway. Investors bought the ten properties for renovation, and hearings to add the buildings (some built as recently as the 1980s) to the historic register were called off.

===Haymarket===
The [[Haymarket (Louisville)|Haymarket]] area, which occupied most of the blocks around Jefferson, Market, Floyd and Preston streets, had a long and ethnically rich history, says University of Louisville archivist Dr. Tom Owen. "Dating as far back as the late 1800s an open-air market was operated here by vendors of varied national heritage," he says. "At that time the Haymarket extended from Preston Street to Second Street and was the center for the majority of the produce traded in the city." The first blow to the Haymarket's produce-market predominance came in 1955, when several fruit vendors and produce companies, including Horton Fruit, Al Campisano Fruit, and the Hill and Sloan, S&amp;S, and Clarence Mayfield produce companies formed the Louisville Produce Association and moved from East Liberty Street to Bishops Lane. The original Haymarket buildings were demolished in the late 1950s as part of an [[urban renewal]] initiative, but a new Haymarket was constructed in the 1960s and expanded several times over the next two decades.

===Architecture and design===
The creator of New York City's [[Central Park]] and father of Louisville's original parks system, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], designed two parks that replaced the original Market Houses, with the mini-parks themselves later replaced by traffic lanes.

Designated in 1983 as part of the Phoenix Hill National Register [[Historic District]], the area has a rich blend of architectural styles, ranging from pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[federal architecture|federal style]] town-homes and [[shotgun house]]s, to [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] residential and commercial structures, as well as large pre and turn of the 20th century buildings built to house Louisville's thriving businesses during the boom following the Civil War. Many of these buildings are today home to the many galleries, shops, restaurants and residents in the district.  This includes Louisville's first commercial building seeking national [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] platinum certification as a green structure, known as [[The Green Building (Louisville, Kentucky)|The Green Building]], located in a 110-year-old former dry goods store.

What may be called the flagship building of NuLu is [[The Green Building (Louisville, Kentucky)|The Green Building]]. It was originally built in 1891 by Sternau's Dry Goods and was used as a dry goods store until it closed in 1949. It has since been used as a Goodwill Thrift Store (1956–1977) and a photography warehouse (1977–2006). In 2006, [[Gill Holland|Gill and Augusta Holland]] purchased the building and began a dramatic renovation to try to achieve LEED Platinum Certification. The Green Building earned LEED Platinum Certification in 2010, becoming Louisville's first commercial LEED Platinum structure and Kentucky's first LEED Platinum adaptive reuse structure. Holland coined the term NuLu.

==Events==
Galleries, museums and other businesses in the East Market District as well as the [[West Main District, Louisville|West Main District]] are prominently featured during the monthly First Friday Hop, where free buses circle the downtown area with stops at most galleries and museums along its route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstfridayhop.com/|title=Republic Bank First Friday Hop|website=firstfridayhop.com|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NuLu East Market Festival is an annual event designed to showcase what the neighborhood and city of Louisville have to offer. Originally held September 26, 2009, the festival featured local vendors, food booths, beer and wine sales and a musical lineup featuring [[Ben Sollee]].

==In popular culture==
Market Street often played host to [[Academy Award]] winning pioneer movie director, [[D. W. Griffith]], a native of nearby [[Oldham County, Kentucky]], whose family had moved to Louisville where D.W. began work for the [[Meffert Stock Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yO48S1mieEsC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=meffert+stock+company&amp;source=web&amp;ots=D0SGb-H4_4&amp;sig=u3sTfjeqDwzSU_Kj-G80QEeQ86Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result |title=D.W.

Meffert, whose family had lived and worked in the 800 block of East Market Street from the 1850s through the 1960s. Writer and director [[Cameron Crowe]] chose the East Market District to shoot scenes for his 2005 film ''[[Elizabethtown (film)|Elizabethtown]]'', starring [[Orlando Bloom]] and [[Kirsten Dunst]].

'''Francisco José Ricardo, Ph.D''' is a media philosopher, author, musician, theorist, and filmmaker. Ricardo is co-founder of the Digital Video Research Archive at [[Boston University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/dbin/dance/|title=Morris, Sword, and Clog Dancing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the founding editor of the book series, ''International Texts in Critical Media Aesthetics''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/series/international-texts-in-critical-media-aesthetics/?pg=1|title=Bloomsbury - International Texts in Critical Media Aesthetics|first=|last=Bloomsbury.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by Bloomsbury. This series focuses primarily on electronic, or [[digital art]], and will publish its twelfth book in 2017. In 2013, Ricardo published ''The Engagement Aesthetic: Experiencing New Media Art through Critique'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/the-engagement-aesthetic-9781623560409/|title=The Engagement Aesthetic|first=|last=Bloomsbury.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he discusses different methods of reflecting on, interacting with, and critiquing [[new media art]]. As media and culture commentator, he examines the loss of reflection in social communication occurring in what he calls hashtag culture, characterized by diminished language, instinctive reactions and responses, a tendency to seek approval from others, and an obsession with certainty -- difficulties that he considers can be addressed by embracing expression through the arts and other self-directed creative activity. Ricardo has appeared on numerous radio talk shows to discuss this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/conceptualist/wtop-fjr-interview-2017september18|title=WTOP Washington, DC News Radio, On Air Interview with Veronica Robinson|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://soundcloud.com/conceptualist/hashtag-culture-on-kogo-21sep2017|title=Francisco Ricardo speaks about Hashtag Culture on NewsRadio 600 KOGO with Ted Garcia and LaDona Harvey|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/conceptualist/francisco-speaks-on-followers-social-media-and-hashtag-culture-on-sirius|title=Francisco speaks on Followers, social media, on SiriusXM Urban View, The Laura Coates Show}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/conceptualist/francisco-speaks-with-terry-gilberg-on-social-media-hashtagculture|title=Francisco Speaks on Social Media and Hashtag Culture with Terry Gilberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and education==
Francisco J. Ricardo was born in 1962 in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. When he was seven, the family moved to [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], and two years later, to [[New York City]]. His father, an architect, and professor at the [[University of Havana]], had studied under [[Josef Albers]] during Albers's residency in Havana. His mother had been a gymnast, and in the U.S. founded a "Health Bauhaus" based on alternative nutrition and numerous forms of exercise, yoga, and meditation. Ricardo studied at [[Harvard University]], receiving a C.A.S [HGSE], and an Ed.M. Ricardo transferred during his doctoral work at Harvard to receive the first Ph.D. in Humanities Computing conferred in the U.S. at the pioneering [[University Professors Program]] of [[Boston University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cybertext.hum.jyu.fi/contributors.php|title=CyberText Yearbook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he worked as Research Associate, later teaching art theory at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].

==Career==
After teaching at RISD, writing and presenting on artists and new media art, including electronic or [[digital art]] (see selected articles), Ricardo decided that he could better show this art, which often employs moving images, through the medium of film. He left teaching and formed the documentary film production company, Conceptualist Films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conceptualistfilms.com|title=ConceptualistFilms.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricardo's vision is to create a new form of documentary on extraordinary artists and musicians - fewer "talking heads" and biographical material; instead, he wants to engage the viewer with unusual imagery while discussing ideas and philosophies in an experimental and accessible way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conceptualistfilms.com/press-release/|title=Press Release – Conceptualist Films Born!|date=22 June 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of his first documentary (released 2016) is on the creative art process of the multifaceted artist [[James Franco]]. Franco, once a student of Ricardo's at RISD, has a wide body of his own experimental art and film work which Ricardo explores in the film, according to the website for ''F FOR FRANCO.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fforfranco.com/|title=fforfranco|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film contains hours of conversations between Ricardo and Franco, in various places such as the [[LA Theater]] and The [[Chateau Marmont]], as well as footage given by Franco to Ricardo of work rarely, if ever, seen before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conceptualistfilms.com/on-the-subject-of-subjects-james-franco/|title=On the Subject of Subjects – James Franco|date=7 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had its world premiere at the Hollywood Film Festival in 2015, reviewed by Neon Tommy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/neon-tommy/film-review-f-for-franco-ac92640b0fa6&lt;/ref&gt; and was reviewed by ''The Hollywood Reporter'', stating it was a "must for Franco completists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/f-franco-film-review-748389 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==CD release==
In 2014, Ricardo released an album of electronic music titled, ''Adding and Subtracting''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MUFM39E?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=adding%20and%20subtracting%20francisco&amp;qid=1452585514&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1|title=Adding and Subtracting|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second album of electronic music,''Groove Morphisms''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0193MZFMI?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=groove%20morphisms&amp;qid=1452584601&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1|title=Groove Morphisms|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; is more complex, and was released in December 2015. 
In early 2016, Francisco released ''A Singular Within'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B73SLZE?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=a%20singular%20within&amp;qid=1457418260&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1|title=A Singular Within|publisher=|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of nine meditative, ambient songs reminiscent of the work of Brian Eno. It's a marked departure from his previous two albums. The digital version of ''A Singular Within'' contains two bonus tracks not found on the physical CD.
Francisco composes his albums electronically, employing a variety of instruments, blending styles and creating complex rhythms. The latest are:

'''Grip''' was a [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] design firm that was home to many of [[Canada]]'s premier designers and painters during the first half of the 20th century.

The company was founded in 1873 by the cartoonist [[John Wilson Bengough|J. W. Bengough]] to publish his satirical weekly magazine ''Grip''.  Bengough also published [[chapbook]]s and did design work and advertising for various clients. He lost control of the company in the 1890s and the magazine ceased publication in 1892. 

After that date the company became better known as an important design firm, providing artwork, wood cuts, and other services for merchandise and print advertising. In the early 20th century it was technologically and artistically one of the most sophisticated design firms in the country.

It was one of the first employers of many of Canada's major artists of the period, and is perhaps most important as where many of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] met one another for the first time. In 1906 [[J.E.H. Macdonald]] became its head designer. In 1908 [[Tom Thomson]] and [[Frank Johnston (artist)|Frank Johnston]] joined the firm as two of Macdonald's designers. In 1911 [[Franklin Carmichael]] was hired as an [[office boy]]. That same year [[Arthur Lismer]] crossed the Atlantic to come work for the firm. The year after, [[Fred Varley]] made the same journey to work for Grip.&lt;ref name="King2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ross King|title=Defiant Spirits: The Modernist Revolution of the Group of Seven|date=25 September 2010|publisher=McMichael Canadian Art Collection|isbn=978-1-55365-807-8|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was later renamed Rapid Grip.  Later it became known as Batten, then Bomac Batten, until it was finally{{vague|reason= in sense of "last so far" or "last considered as carrying on 7's tradition" or perhaps other nuances|date=December 2017}} purchased by the [[Laird Group]].

''Grip'' magazine was briefly revived in 2000 as a satirical quarterly, published by the Toronto-based Lategan Media Group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8014">{{main|Music of Madagascar}}
The ''hiragasy'' (''hira'': song; ''gasy'': Malagasy) is a [[music of Madagascar|musical tradition in Madagascar]] and particularly among the [[Merina]] ethnic group of the Highland regions around the capital of [[Antananarivo]]. 
The '''hiragasy''' is a day-long spectacle of music, dance, and ''[[Hainteny#Kabary|kabary]]'' oratory performed by a troupe (typically related by blood or marriage and of rural origin) or as a competition between two troupes.

==Origins and history==
[[File:HiragasyAmpefy.JPG|350px|thumb|right|Hiragasy performance near Ampefy, Madagascar, in July 2008.]]
The tradition in its contemporary form began in the late 18th century when Merina prince [[Andrianampoinimerina]] first used musicians to draw a crowd for his political speeches (''[[Hainteny#Kabary|kabary]]''); these troupes became independent, and began to incorporate political commentary and critique in their performances.  The audience plays an active role at hiragasy events, expressing their satisfaction with the talent of the troupe members and the message they proclaim through applause, cheers or sounds of disapproval.&lt;ref name = Mauro&gt;{{Cite book | last = Mauro | first = Didier | title = Madagascar, l'opéra du peuple: anthropologie d'un fait social total: l'art Hira Gasy entre tradition et rébellion | publisher = KARTHALA Editions | location = Paris | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-2-84586-019-3|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hiragasy troupes were used during the French colonial administration to communicate decrees and other information to the rural population in the Highlands, and as such troupe members were exempt from the forced labor requirements imposed on all other Malagasy.&lt;ref name = Edkvist&gt;{{Cite book | last = 
Edkvist | first = Ingela | title = The Performance of Tradition: An Ethnography of Hira Gasy Popular Theatre in Madagascar | publisher = Uppsala Universitet | location = Uppsala | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-91-554-4070-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After independence from France in 1960, the hiragasy troupe was held up as an icon of traditional Malagasy culture, and began to find greater popularity along the coasts, although performances remain largely concentrated in the Highlands.  Aspiring politicians routinely hire hiragasy troupes to attract a crowd for their political speeches while campaigning.  While most troupes remain apolitical, some have opted to throw their support behind particular candidates to spectacular effect, as when former hiragasy member-cum-popstar [[Rossy (musician)|Rossy]] authored his 1995 song "Lera."  The song was critical of the [[Albert Zafy|Zafy]] regime and was picked up by hiragasy troupes, who performed it across the island; the popularity of this song played a key role in mobilizing popular support for Zafy's impeachment.&lt;ref name = Mauro/&gt; The most famous troupe is [[Ramilison Besigara|Ramilison Fenoarivo]], Rossy's former troupe and staunch supporter of ex-President [[Didier Ratsiraka]].

==Structure and performance==
The performance of the hiragasy follows a number of conventions, such that there are certain similarities between the 80+ troupes currently performing in Madagascar.  Among these are the order in which songs, dances and oratory are performed; how troupes are named (after the last name of the founding member and his/her town of origin); what costumes are worn (men typically wear straw hats, red coats and pants inspired by 19th century French military garb, and matching [[Lamba (garment)|lamba]] cloth sashes; women wear identical dresses designed after the style popular among ladies of the court during the [[list of Malagasy monarchs|Imperial period]]); and which instruments are used.  Traditional instruments are not common at hiragasy performances, due to the origins of the performance with the royal court, where European influences reigned.  Instead, the most common instruments are [[violin]]s, [[trumpet]]s, and [[snare drum|snare]] and [[bass drum]]s; the [[sodina]], [[accordion]], [[kabosy]] or [[clarinet]] may occasionally make an appearance.
[[File:Raholiarisoamadagascar.tif|thumb|right|alt=woman singing in red, green and white dress|Celebrated artist Raholiarisoa performing hiragasy at Mahamasina Stadium, Antananarivo]]
Hiragasy follow a specific structure under the direction of the troupe leader who is often the oldest member and responsible for the presentation of [[Hainteny#Kabary|kabary]].  &lt;br /&gt;
'''1.''' '''The Sasitehaka''': Over the course of approximately ten minutes, the male members of the troupe settle in the middle of the crowd of spectators as the snare and base drummers beat an accompanying militaristic rhythm.  The women are often to the side, completing their wardrobe and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;
'''2. The Mpikabary (Making Kabary)''':  One of the artists, often the troupe leader or oldest member of the group, will typically take off his straw hat and formally announce the beginning of the spectacle.  He will invite the female members of the troupe to come to the stage and then, after a short instrumental performance, the artist will take about five minutes to introduce the theme (''indray miditra'') of the show through ''kabary'' - a traditional type of formalized and poetic speech incorporating [[ohabolana]] (proverbs).   &lt;br /&gt;
'''3. The Renihira (Queen Song)''': The singers of the group form a circle facing outward and sing in harmony on the selected theme while the musicians, seated to the side, accompany them.  This theme is explored and developed at length, often for more than an hour, and the singers punctuate their message with emphatic hand gestures and facial expressions.  &lt;br /&gt;
'''4. The Dihy (Dance):''' The singers take a seat on the ground while the musicians play behind one, two or several dancers who will perform for approximately 15 minutes.  A [[Hainteny#Kabary|kabary]] (''kabarindihy'') is presented on the topic of the dance to be performed and announces the title of the song that accompanies it.  There are two typical forms of dance that may be performed.  The true ''Dihy'' is typically performed by two dancers and the style is often acrobatic or takes its inspiration from martial arts.  The ''Tsikandihy'' or ''Dihy Irery'' is typically performed by one male dancer, occasionally accompanied by a female dancer.  The dancing segment is concluded with another short kabary that again touches on the theme of the performance and introduces the final part.&lt;br /&gt;
'''5. The Zanakira or Vakodrazana''':  A short performance lasting approximately 20 minutes that concludes the spectacle.&lt;ref name = Jourde&gt;{{Cite book | last = Raison-Jourde | first = Françoise | title = Bible et pouvoir à Madagascar au XIXe siècle | publisher = KARTHALA Editions | location = Paris | year = 1991 | pages = 714–732 | isbn = 978-2-86537-317-8 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2G5SZ0XqM48C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate = March 27, 2011 | language = French}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

When two or more troupes are competing, each troupe takes its turn at each stage before all proceed to the next stage of the performance.  The troupes may all complete the entire cycle (this first round is termed the Vakisehatra) before repeating the entire process in a second round with a new set of themes (the second round being known as the Adi-Kiha) before all conclude with the Vakodrazana.  In these competitive performances, troupes may have as many as three or more themes to explore and the competition may last from early morning until nightfall.

'''''L'Arlésienne''''', '''''L'Arlésienne: Madame Ginoux''''', or '''''Portrait of Madame Ginoux''''' is the title given to a group of six similar [[painting]]s by [[Vincent van Gogh]], painted in [[Arles]], November 1888 (or later), and in [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]], February 1890.  '''L'Arlésienne''' is pronounced 'lar lay zyen'; it means literally "the woman from Arles".

The subject, ''Marie Jullian'' (or ''Julien''), was born in [[Arles]] June 8, 1848 and died there August 2, 1911.  She married ''Joseph-Michel Ginoux'' in 1866 and together they ran the ''Café de la Gare'', 30 Place Lamartine, where van Gogh lodged from May to mid-September 1888.  He had the [[Yellow House (painting)|Yellow House]] in Arles furnished to settle there.

Evidently until this time, van Gogh's relations to M. and Mme. Ginoux had remained more or less commercial (the café is the subject of ''[[The Night Café]]''), but [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]]'s arrival in Arles altered the situation.  His courtship charmed the lady, then about 40 years of age, and in the first few days of November 1888 Madame Ginoux agreed to have a portrait session for Gauguin, and his friend van Gogh.  Within an hour, Gauguin produced a charcoal drawing while Vincent produced a full-scale painting, "knocked off in ''one'' hour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Theo van Gogh. Arles, on or about Saturday, 3 November 1888|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let717/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=''[[Van Gogh Museum|Vincent van Gogh Museum]]''|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==November 1888 version and its ''repetition''==

Van Gogh's first version, now in the [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris, is painted on [[Hessian (cloth)|burlap]].  A complete ''piece'' of this fabric was acquired by Gauguin just after his arrival in Arles, and used by both artists in November and December 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Letter; see Druick &amp; Seghers&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

For the second version, now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]], van Gogh again painted on the commercially pre-primed canvas he had previously used, and he replaced the gloves and umbrella with some books.

==February 1890 versions==

While in the asylum at [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]], van Gogh painted another five portraits of Madame Ginoux, based on Gauguin's charcoal drawing of November 1888. Of these, one was intended for Gauguin, one for his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], one for himself and one for Madame Ginoux. The provenance of the version in the [[Kröller-Müller Museum]] is not known in detail, but the painting is known to have been previously owned by [[Albert Aurier]], an early champion of Vincent's paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Aurier, G. Albert. "[http://www.vggallery.com/misc/archives/aurier.htm The Isolated Ones: Vincent van Gogh]", January, 1890. Reproduced on vggallery.com. Retrieved 25 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The version intended for Madame Ginoux was lost and has not been recovered. This is the version Vincent was delivering to Madame Ginoux in Arles when he suffered his relapse on February 22, 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hulsker|first=Jan|title=The Complete Van Gogh|year=1985|publisher=Crescent|isbn=0-517-44867-X|page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an unfinished letter to Gauguin that was never sent, Vincent remarked that working on her portrait cost him another month of illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Paul Gauguin, Auvers-sur-Oise, on or about Tuesday, 17 June 1890|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/RM23/letter.html|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=''[[Van Gogh Museum]]''|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauguin's version was the one with a pink background, currently in the São Paulo Museum of Art. Gauguin was enthusiastic about the portrait, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I've seen the canvas of Madame Ginoux. Very fine and very curious, I like it better than my drawing. Despite your ailing state you have never worked with so much ''balance'' while conserving the sensation and the interior warmth needed for a ''work of art'', precisely in an era when art is a business regulated in advance by cold calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Gauguin to Vincent van Gogh.

In a letter to his sister [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]], dated 5 June 1890, Vincent set out his philosophy for doing portraits: "I should like to do portraits which will appear as revelations to people in a hundred years' time.  In other words I am not trying to achieve this by photographic likeness but by rendering our impassioned expressions, by using our modern knowledge and appreciation of colour as a means of rendering and exalting character ... The portrait of the Arlésienne has a colourless and matt flesh tone, the eyes are calm and very simple, the clothing is black, the background pink, and she is leaning on a green table with green books. But in the copy that Theo has, the clothing is pink, the background yellowy-white, and the front of the open bodice is muslin in a white that merges into green. Among all these light colours, only the hair, the eyelashes and the eyes form black patches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pomerans|first=Arnold|title=The Letters of Vincent Van Gogh|year=1996|publisher=[[Penguin Group|The Penguin Press]]|isbn=0-14-044674-5|url=http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780140446746,00.html|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Willemien van Gogh.

==Gauguin's versions==

Gauguin produced a charcoal sketch at the original sitting of Madame Ginoux in November 1888, and later produced a canvas.

[[File:Minotauros Myron NAMA 1664 n1.jpg|thumb|In classical mythology, the [[Minotaur]] was defeated by the [[hero]] [[Theseus]].]]
A '''legendary''', '''mythical''', or '''mythological creature''', traditionally called a '''fabulous beast''' or '''fabulous creature''', is a  fictitious, imaginary and often supernatural [[animal]], often a [[Mythological hybrid|hybrid]], sometimes part [[human]], whose existence has not or cannot be proved and that is described in [[folklore]] or [[fiction]] but also in historical accounts before history became a science.

In the [[classical era]], monstrous creatures such as the [[cyclops]] and the [[Minotaur]] appear in [[hero]]ic tales for the protagonist to destroy. Other creatures, such as the [[unicorn]], were claimed in accounts of [[natural history]] by various scholars of antiquity.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information |year=1911 |publisher=University Press |page=581}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dundes1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bascom |first=William |authorlink3=William Bascom |editor=Alan Dundes |title=Sacred Narrative: Readings in the Theory of Myth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5Om2ALAFbEC&amp;q=Three_Forms_of_Prose_Narratives#v=snippet&amp;q=table&amp;f=false |year=1984 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520051928 |page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SimpsonRoud2000"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simpson |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Roud |first2=Steve |title=A Dictionary of English Folklore |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTcdvd1iRXsC&amp;q=myth#v=snippet&amp;q=myths&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 March 2013 |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780192100191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some legendary creatures have their origin in traditional [[mythology]] and were believed to be real creatures, for example [[dragon]]s, [[griffin]]s, and [[unicorn]]s. Others were based on real encounters, originating in garbled accounts of travelers' tales, such as the [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary]], which supposedly grew tethered to the earth.&lt;ref name="Large&amp;Braggins"&gt;{{cite book | last=Large | first=Mark F. |author2=John E. Braggins | title=Tree Ferns | publisher=Timber Press, Incorporated | year=2004 | location=Portland, Oregon | page=360 | isbn=978-0-88192-630-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==
[[File:85-Oxford 1511 - Unicorno.jpg|thumb|upright|Medieval [[bestiary|bestiaries]] included mythical animals like the [[monoceros (legendary creature)|monoceros]] (above) alongside real animals like the [[bear]].]]
{{further|List of legendary creatures by type|List of Greek mythological creatures}}
A variety of mythical animals appear in the art and stories of the [[Classical era]]. For example in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', monstrous creatures include the [[Cyclops]], [[Scylla]] and [[Charybdis]] for the hero [[Odysseus]] to confront. In other tales there appear the [[medusa (mythology)|Medusa]] to be defeated by [[Perseus]], the (human/bull) [[Minotaur]] to be destroyed by [[Theseus]], and the [[Hydra (mythology)|Hydra]] to be killed by [[Heracles]], while [[Aeneas]] battles with the [[harpy|harpies]]. These monsters thus have the basic function of emphasizing the greatness of the [[hero]]es involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Delahoyde |first1=M. |last2=McCartney |first2=Katherine S. |title=Monsters in Classical Mythology |url=http://public.wsu.edu/~delahoyd/classical.monsters.html |publisher=Washington State University |accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Pierre. The Dictionary of Classical Mythology. Blackwell Reference, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Frances E. Classical Myths That Live Today. Silver Burdett Company, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some classical era creatures, such as the (horse/human) [[centaur]], [[Chimera (mythology)|chimaera]], [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] and the [[Pegasus|flying horse]], are found also in [[Indian art]]. Similarly, [[sphinx]]es appear as winged lions in Indian art and the [[Piasa Bird]] of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murthy |first=K. Krishna |title=Mythical Animals in Indian Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMI4rZuRs1MC&amp;pg=PA68 |year=1985 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn=978-0-391-03287-3 |pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=O'Flaherty, Wendy |title=Hindu Myths: A Sourcebook |publisher=Penguin |date=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medieval art]], animals, both real and mythical, played important roles. These included decorative forms as in medieval jewellery, sometimes with their limbs intricately interlaced. Animal forms were used to add humor or majesty to objects. In [[Christian art]], animals carried symbolic meanings, where for example the lamb symbolized Christ, a dove indicated the [[Holy Spirit]], and the classical [[griffin]] represented a guardian of the dead. [[Medieval bestiary|Medieval bestiaries]] included animals regardless of biological reality; the [[basilisk]] represented the [[devil]], while the [[manticore]] symbolised temptation.&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;{{cite web |author=Boehm, Barbara Drake; Holcomb, Melanie |date=January 2012 |origyear=2001 |title=Animals in Medieval Art |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/best/hd_best.htm |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegory==
[[File:Roof detail, dragon.jpg|thumb|Symbolic power: a [[dragon]] in the [[Imperial City, Huế]], Vietnam]]
{{further|Allegory}}
One function of mythical animals in the Middle Ages was allegory. Unicorns, for example, were described as extraordinarily swift and uncatchable by traditional methods.&lt;ref name="Gravestock"&gt;Gravestock, Pamela. "Did Imaginary Animals Exist?" In ''The Mark of the Beast: The Medieval Bestiary in Art, Life, and Literature''. New York: Garland. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}} It was believed that the only way for one to catch this beast was to lead a virgin to its dwelling. Then, the unicorn was supposed to leap into her lap and go to sleep, at which point a hunter could finally capture it.&lt;ref name="Gravestock"/&gt;{{rp|127}} In terms of symbolism, the unicorn was a metaphor for Christ. Unicorns represented the idea of innocence and purity. In the [[King James Version|King James Bible]], Psalm 92:10 states, "My horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn." This is because the translators of the King James erroneously translated the Hebrew word [[re'em]] as unicorn.&lt;ref name="Gravestock"/&gt;{{rp|128}} Later versions translate this as wild ox.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Schrader. ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', New Series, Vol. 44, No. 1, "A Medieval Bestiary" (Summer, 1986), pp. 1+12–55, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The unicorn's small size signifies the humility of Christ.&lt;ref name="Gravestock"/&gt;{{rp|128}}

Another common legendary creature which served allegorical functions within the Middle Ages was the [[dragon]]. Dragons were identified with serpents, though their attributes were greatly intensified. The dragon was supposed to have been larger than all other animals.&lt;ref name="Gravestock"/&gt;{{rp|126}} It was believed that the dragon had no harmful poison but was able to slay anything it embraced without any need for venom. Biblical scriptures speak of the dragon in reference to the devil, and they were used to denote sin in general during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Gravestock"/&gt;{{rp|126}} Dragons were said to have dwelled in places like Ethiopia and India, based on the idea that there was always heat present in these locations.&lt;ref name="Gravestock"/&gt;{{rp|126}}

Physical detail was not the central focus of the artists depicting such animals, and medieval bestiaries were not conceived as biological categorizations. Creatures like the unicorn and [[griffin]] were not categorized in a separate "mythological" section in medieval bestiaries,&lt;ref name="Flores"&gt;Flores, Nona C., "The Mirror of Nature Distorted: The Medieval Artist's Dilemma in Depicting Animals". In ''The Medieval World of Nature''. New York: Garland. 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|124}} as the symbolic implications were of primary importance. Animals we know to have existed were still presented with a fantastical approach. It seems the religious and moral implications of animals were far more significant than matching a physical likeness in these renderings. Nona C. Flores explains, "By the tenth century, artists were increasingly bound by allegorical interpretation, and abandoned naturalistic depictions."&lt;ref name="Flores"/&gt;{{rp|15}} Similarly, the historian [[Richard Kieckhefer]] explains, "Magic is not meant to work but to express wishes, or to encode in symbols a perception of how things do or should work."&lt;ref&gt;Kieckhefer, Richard. "The Specific Rationality of Medieval Magic". In ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 99, Issue 3, 813-836. 1994, 814.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Liber Flavus Fergusiorum''' ("Yellow Book of the [[Ó Fearghuis]]", aka '''RIA MS 23 O 48 a-b''', is a medieval Irish text, dated to c. 1437-40.

==Ó Fearghuis==
'''Ó Fearghuis''' was the name of a [[Gaels|Gaelic]]-[[Irish people|Irish]] medical family from Connacht. The [[surname]] is now generally rendered as [[Fergus (name)|Fergus]]. The family were originally based at Roscam, in [[Clann Fhergail]] (between [[Oranmore]] and [[Galway City]]). In the 13th century they seem to have removed to north Connacht, to what would later become [[County Mayo]]. During the 14th-century members of the family created the [[manuscript]] which would come to be known as Liber Flavus Fergusiorum. The last member of the family to own it was [[John Fergus (scholar)]], who died in Dublin about 1761.

The Liber was composed at various times by several different scribes, the principal one identifying himself as Aedh. Two translators, Seaán Ó Conchubair and Uidhisdín Mag Raighin, are named in [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]]s. Ó Conchubair translated a work on the [[Office of the Dead]] into Irish, while Mag Raighin translated the Life of [[John the Evangelist]].

The book derives its name from the [[Ó Fearghuis]] family, whose descendant, Dr. [[John Fergus]], brought the manuscript from [[County Mayo]] to [[Dublin]] in the 18th century. Upon his death in 1761, it was held by his daughter, Frances Arabella Kennedy, whose grandson deposited it in the [[Royal Irish Academy]] in 1875.

The Academy's website describes the Liber as a

&lt;blockquote&gt;"manuscript is of [[Connacht]] provenance and from the names of places mentioned, written in [[Co. Roscommon]]. The contents are mainly religious tracts, lives of the saints, passions and homilies and some legendary episodes from the [[Ulster cycle]] and the tale of [[Fortinbras]] (Stair Fierabhrais).The writing is in double columns and initial capitals are coloured throughout Vol.1 but not in Vol. 2. The manuscript is in fairly good condition with leather binding; some leaves are badly stained with consequent complete or partial obliteration of the content."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16720">In relativistic [[physics]], '''Lorentz symmetry''', named for [[Hendrik Lorentz]], is an equivalence of observation or observational symmetry due to [[special relativity]] implying that the laws of physics stay the same for all observers that are moving with respect to one another within an [[inertial frame]]. It has also been described as "the feature of nature that says experimental results are independent of the orientation or the boost velocity of the laboratory through space".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29224 |title=Framing Lorentz symmetry |publisher=CERN Courier |date=2004-11-24 |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lorentz covariance''', a related concept, is a property of the underlying [[spacetime]] manifold.  Lorentz covariance has two distinct, but closely related meanings:

# A [[physical quantity]] is said to be Lorentz covariant if it transforms under a given [[group representation|representation]] of the [[Lorentz group]]. According to the [[representation theory of the Lorentz group]], these quantities are built out of [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]s, [[four-vector]]s, [[four-tensor]]s, and [[spinor]]s. In particular, a Lorentz covariant scalar (e.g., the [[space-time interval]])  remains the same under [[Lorentz transformation]]s and is said to be a ''Lorentz invariant'' (i.e., they transform under the [[trivial representation]]).
# An [[equation]] is said to be Lorentz covariant if it can be written in terms of Lorentz covariant quantities (confusingly, some use the term ''invariant'' here). The key property of such equations is that if they hold in one inertial frame, then they hold in any inertial frame; this follows from the result that if all the components of a tensor vanish in one frame, they vanish in every frame. This condition is a requirement according to the [[principle of relativity]]; i.e., all non-[[gravitation]]al laws must make the same predictions for identical experiments taking place at the same spacetime event in two different [[inertial frames of reference]].

On [[manifold]]s, the words [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|''covariant'' and ''contravariant'']] refer to how objects transform under general coordinate transformations. Both covariant and contravariant four-vectors can be Lorentz covariant quantities.

'''Local Lorentz covariance''', which follows from [[general relativity]], refers to Lorentz covariance applying only [[local symmetry|''locally'']] in an infinitesimal region of spacetime at every point. There is a generalization of this concept to cover [[Poincare covariance|Poincaré covariance]] and Poincaré invariance.

==Examples==

In general, the (transformational) nature of a Lorentz tensor{{clarify|this terminology should be introduced before use|date=March 2017}} can be identified by its [[tensor order]], which is the number of free indices it has. No indices implies it is a scalar, one implies that it is a vector, etc.  Some tensors with a physical interpretation are listed below.

The [[sign convention]] of the [[Minkowski metric]] η = [[diagonal matrix|diag]] (1, −1, −1, −1) is used throughout the article.

== Lorentz violating models ==
{{See also|Modern searches for Lorentz violation}}

In standard field theory, there are very strict and severe constraints on [[Renormalization group#Relevant and irrelevant operators, universality classes|marginal and relevant]] Lorentz violating operators within both [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]] and the [[Standard Model]]. Irrelevant Lorentz violating operators may be suppressed by a high [[cutoff (physics)|cutoff]] scale, but they typically induce marginal and relevant Lorentz violating operators via radiative corrections. So, we also have very strict and severe constraints on irrelevant Lorentz violating operators.

Since some approaches to [[quantum gravity]] lead to violations of Lorentz invariance,&lt;ref name="Mattingly"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.12942/lrr-2005-5|pmid=28163649|pmc=5253993|title=Modern Tests of Lorentz Invariance|year=2005|last1=Mattingly|first1=David|journal=Living Reviews in Relativity|volume=8|issue=1|pages=5|arxiv = gr-qc/0502097 |bibcode = 2005LRR.....8....5M }}&lt;/ref&gt; these studies are part of [[Phenomenological Quantum Gravity]]. Lorentz violations are allowed in [[string theory]], [[supersymmetry]] and [[Horava-Lifshitz gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03434 Neutrino Interferometry for High-Precision Tests of Lorentz Symmetry with IceCube]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorentz violating models typically fall into four classes:{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

* The laws of physics are exactly [[Lorentz covariant]] but this symmetry is [[spontaneously broken]]. In [[special relativity|special relativistic]] theories, this leads to [[phonon]]s, which are the [[Goldstone boson]]s. The phonons travel at ''less'' than the [[speed of light]].
* Similar to the approximate Lorentz symmetry of phonons in a lattice (where the speed of sound plays the role of the critical speed), the Lorentz symmetry of special relativity (with the speed of light as the critical speed in vacuum) is only a low-energy limit of the laws of physics, which involve new phenomena at some fundamental scale. Bare conventional "elementary" particles are not point-like field-theoretical objects at very small distance scales, and a nonzero fundamental length must be taken into account. Lorentz symmetry violation is governed by an energy-dependent parameter which tends to zero as momentum decreases.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez-MestresMoriond1995"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Properties of a possible class of particles able to travel faster than light |journal=Dark Matter in Cosmology |pages=645 |author=Luis Gonzalez-Mestres |date=1995-05-25 |arxiv=astro-ph/9505117 |bibcode=1995dmcc.conf..645G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such patterns require the existence of a [[preferred frame|privileged local inertial frame]] (the "vacuum rest frame"). They can be tested, at least partially, by ultra-high energy cosmic ray experiments like the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]].&lt;ref name="Gonzalez-MestresICRC97"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Absence of Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin Cutoff and Stability of Unstable Particles at Very High Energy, as a Consequence of Lorentz Symmetry Violation |journal=Proceedings of the 25th International Cosmic Ray Conference (held 30 July - 6 August |author=Luis Gonzalez-Mestres |volume = 6|pages=113 |date=1997-05-26 |bibcode = 1997ICRC....6..113G|arxiv=physics/9705031}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The laws of physics are symmetric under a [[deformation theory|deformation]] of the Lorentz or more generally, the [[Poincaré group]], and this deformed symmetry is exact and unbroken. This deformed symmetry is also typically a [[quantum group]] symmetry, which is a generalization of a group symmetry. [[Deformed special relativity]] is an example of this class of models. The deformation is scale dependent, meaning that at length scales much larger than the Planck scale, the symmetry looks pretty much like the Poincaré group. Ultra-high energy cosmic ray experiments cannot test such models.
* [[Very special relativity]] forms a class of its own; if [[CP symmetry|charge-parity]] (CP) is an exact symmetry, a subgroup of the Lorentz group is sufficient to give us all the standard predictions. This is, however, not the case.

Models belonging to the first two classes can be consistent with experiment if Lorentz breaking happens at Planck scale or beyond it, or even before it in suitable [[preon]]ic models,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez-MestresCrete2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1051/epjconf/20147100062|title=Ultra-high energy physics and standard basic principles. Do Planck units really make sense?|journal=EPJ Web of Conferences|volume=71|pages=00062|year=2014|author=Luis Gonzalez-Mestres|url=http://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/pdf/2014/08/epjconf_icnfp2013_00062.pdf|publisher=EPJ Web of Conferences (ICNFP 2013 Conference)|bibcode=2014EPJWC..7100062G}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if Lorentz symmetry violation is governed by a suitable energy-dependent parameter. One then has a class of models which deviate from Poincaré symmetry near the Planck scale but still flows towards an exact Poincaré group at very large length scales.  This is also true for the third class, which is furthermore protected from radiative corrections as one still has an exact (quantum) symmetry.

Even though there is no evidence of the violation of Lorentz invariance, several experimental searches for such violations have been performed during recent years. A detailed summary of the results of these searches is given in the Data Tables for Lorentz and CPT Violation.&lt;ref name="DataTables"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorentz invariance is also violated in QFT assuming non-zero temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laine|first=Mikko|last2=Vuorinen|first2=Aleksi|date=2016|title=Basics of Thermal Field Theory|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-31933-9|journal=Lecture Notes in Physics|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-31933-9|issn=0075-8450|arxiv=1701.01554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ojima|first=Izumi|date=January 1986|title=Lorentz invariance vs. temperature in QFT|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF00417467|journal=Letters in Mathematical Physics|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=73–80|doi=10.1007/bf00417467|issn=0377-9017|bibcode=1986LMaPh..11...73O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/131197/proof-of-loss-of-lorentz-invariance-in-finite-temperature-quantum-field-theory/137133|title=Proof of Loss of Lorentz Invariance in Finite Temperature Quantum Field Theory|website=Physics Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainly Mozart was created in 1988&lt;ref name="in1988"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2012/oct/16/Mainly-Mozart-Atherton/ |title=Mainly Mozart founding conductor David Atherton resigns |last=Chute |first=James |date=October 16, 2012 |newspaper=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]] |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207104444/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2012/oct/16/Mainly-Mozart-Atherton/ |archivedate=February 7, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Maestro]] [[David Atherton]] and Executive Director Nancy Laturno Bojanic, formerly of the [[San Diego Symphony]], to give the people of [[Southern California]] and [[Baja California]] an opportunity to experience classical music performed live in the summer by principal orchestral musicians. 

The focus was placed on [[Mozart]] because he is considered one of the world's greatest composers, and because of the breadth of masterful works that he composed specifically for [[chamber orchestra]]. Since its inception, Mainly Mozart has added the works of other composers with an emphasis on those of the 18th and 19th centuries.  Using the common language of music, Mainly Mozart has served as a regional resource by connecting communities in Southern California and [[Baja California]] to Mainly Mozart musicians, classical music, and stories behind the music.

==Presentations==
===Concerts===
The first Mainly Mozart Festival in June 1989 – a series of nine concerts—was performed on the outdoor stage of the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in [[Balboa Park, San Diego, California|Balboa Park]]. Over the ensuing years, Mainly Mozart has increased its overall annual concert performances staged at various venues.  In June 2008, and just in time for the 20th anniversary of the Mainly Mozart Festival, Mainly Mozart will become the primary tenant of the restored 83-year-old, 1,300-seat [[Balboa Theatre]] in downtown San Diego. A $26-million renovation of the “jewel box” theatre has maintained its blend of [[Mediterranean]], [[Moorish]] and [[Spanish Revival]] architectural styles. Since 1992, the [[Balboa Theatre]] has been on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. San Diego’s Centre City Development Corporation funded the restoration.

===Spotlight Series===
In 1996, Mainly Mozart began producing the Spotlight Series featuring chamber music concerts during the winter and spring. The principal home of the series is The [[Scripps Research Institute]] in [[La Jolla, San Diego, California|La Jolla]], but facilities in the north [[San Diego County]] coastal community of [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]], and the inland community of [[Rancho Santa Fe, California|Rancho Santa Fe]] are also used.

===Bi-national and educational outreach===
In 1992 the Mainly Mozart Orchestra was invited to participate in the first Festival Internacional de Mozart in [[Baja California]] (now Mozart Binacional). This was also the year that Mainly Mozart established an educational component to bring music to students in low income or at risk neighborhoods in both San Diego County and Baja California. These programs are continually expanding and now reach over 60,000 students in both countries.

The lives and music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] are brought to school children through the Living Composers Series. These informative and entertaining half-hour assemblies engage students in interactive mini-plays set to the music of these master composers. Question and answer session rounds out the teaching session, and in-school materials are provided for both the pre- and post- performance educational activities.

Mainly Mozart also has been working to enrich the lives of economically disadvantaged families in [[Southeast San Diego]] through a partnership with the Jackie Robinson Family [[YMCA]]. Mainly Mozart's free ticket program has allowed hundreds of children to enjoy their very first concert experience at [[Copley Symphony Hall]] (home of the [[San Diego Symphony]]). In another outreach program, Mainly Mozart offers high school and college music students discounted concert tickets.

== Other endeavors ==
===The Amadeus Suite===
Mainly Mozart commissioned “The Amadeus Suite” in 1999. It was created by British jazz trumpeter [[Guy Barker]], who based his composition on characters from Mozart operas. In 2006, the suite was expanded by Barker and was performed in San Diego during the Mainly Mozart-led year-long San Diego County-wide celebration of Mozart's 250th birthday (January 27, 1756). The celebration was coordinated with cultural officials in [[Austria]].

=== Club Amadeus ===
To show its appreciation of its patron/donors, Mainly Mozart has presented a smaller, more intimate concert series known as Club Amadeus.  The supporters hear chamber music in elegant private residences and other special venues throughout San Diego.
Other annual funding for Mainly Mozart is provided, in part, by the [[City of San Diego Commission for Arts and Culture]]; the County of San Diego Community Enhancement program; the [[California Arts Council]]; the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]; and contributions from local businesses and foundations.

'''''Mass Effect 2: Overlord''''' is a [[downloadable content]] pack developed by [[BioWare]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] for the 2010 [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] video game ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox 360]] in 2010, and is included in the [[PlayStation 3]] version of ''Mass Effect 2'', which was released in 2011. Set on a remote [[Earth]]-like planet during the 22nd century, ''Overlord'' follows the events of an experimental [[virtual intelligence]] that has gone rogue.

''Overlord'' comprises a new series of missions for the player to complete and encourages planetary exploration aboard a hovering vehicle called the Hammerhead. Its vehicle exploration aspect was designed to be similar to that found in the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]''. ''Overlord'' received positive reviews from critics, who praised its frightening atmosphere and open-ended exploration. Criticism was targeted at the Hammerhead's simplistic combat and unnatural jumping mechanics.

''Mass Effect 2: Overlord'' is a [[downloadable content]] pack for the 2010 [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] video game ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''. Set on a remote [[Earth]]-like planet called Aite during the 22nd century, it follows the events of an experimental [[virtual intelligence]] that has gone rogue. The player assumes the role of [[Commander Shepard]], an elite human soldier who is ordered by Dr. Gavin Archer to gain access to the station where the virtual intelligence is kept in [[lockdown]] and shut it down. Shepard succeeds, but learns that Archer had been trying to gain influence over a hostile race of networked [[artificial intelligence]]s by interfacing his autistic brother's mind with the virtual intelligence.&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; Shepard is then given the option to either take his brother to a specialized academy or leave him at the station with Archer.&lt;ref name="GSpot guide"/&gt;

''Overlord'' comprises a series of missions that take place in different facilities on the surface of Aite and that generally involve squad-based combat.&lt;ref name="GSpot guide"/&gt; It unfolds in a [[Nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]] manner and encourages planetary exploration.&lt;ref name="1UP announcement"/&gt; To go from one mission to another, the player must use a hovering vehicle called the Hammerhead.&lt;ref name="GRev review"/&gt; The player can freely explore Aite aboard the vehicle and change squad members before starting a mission.&lt;ref name="GCritics review"/&gt; There is [[side-quest]] that requires the player to collect several data packs on the planet.&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; The Hammerhead has the ability to jump over obstacles to reach certain areas and is armed with a gun that the player can use to destroy hostile targets over the planet.&lt;ref name="GSpot guide"/&gt; ''Overlord'' also includes three in-game upgrades, which allow the player to enhance certain aspects of the game's weapons and armor, as well as two [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievements]].&lt;ref name="Achievements"/&gt;

==Development and release==
''Overlord'' was developed by [[BioWare]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. During development of ''Mass Effect 2'', Bioware stated that downloadable content was becoming a fundamental part of the company's overall philosophy.&lt;ref name="IGN interview"/&gt; The pack was announced to be in development on May 13, 2010.&lt;ref name="IGN announcement"/&gt; BioWare executive producer [[Casey Hudson]] stated that ''Overlord'' was the "biggest downloadable content pack yet" and confirmed that they would not introduce more squad members to the game like they did with previous packs.&lt;ref name="Biggest DLC yet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UP announcement"/&gt; The developers focused on exploration and vehicle platforming, similar to that found in ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s earlier downloadable content pack ''Firewalker''.&lt;ref name="GS preview"/&gt; Since vehicle exploration was a feature of the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]'', Hudson called ''Overlord'' "a throwback to how some of the exploration worked in [the first] ''Mass Effect''."&lt;ref name="GS preview"/&gt; The soundtrack was composed by [[Christopher Lennertz]].&lt;ref name="Overlord soundtrack"/&gt; The pack was released on June 15, 2010, for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox 360]]. Like ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s other downloadable content packs [[Mass Effect 2: Kasumi – Stolen Memory|''Kasumi – Stolen Memory'']] and [[Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker|''Lair of the Shadow Broker'']], ''Overlord'' is freely included in the [[PlayStation 3]] version of the game, which was released on January 18, 2011.&lt;ref name="IGN version differences"/&gt;

''Overlord'' received positive reviews from critics. Reviewer Erik Brudvig of [[IGN]] described it as "one of the best series of missions that the franchise has yet seen."&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Similarly, reviewer Dan Whitehead of [[Eurogamer]] opined that the pack "never lets one gameplay element dominate for too long, leavening the expected [[Cover system|duck-and-cover]] combat with openworld exploration and a dash of environmental puzzling, all wrapped up in a story that builds to a satisfying and pathos-heavy finale."&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Kevin VanOrd credited the on-foot action, stating that "a few of the larger environments let you take on [enemies] from multiple angles, which are a nice change from the straight-on encounters that typify most of ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s battles."&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; He also praised the final [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] battle, which he felt exceeded that of the main game.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;

Critics generally praised the vehicular sections of the mission. Eurogamer felt that the Hammerhead "responds well to the terrain, with just the right mix of weight and bounciness."&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; IGN considered it an improvement over the Mako carrier featured in the original ''Mass Effect''.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Brad Gallaway of GameCritics, who gave the main game a mixed review, was satisfied with its inclusion and felt that BioWare "managed to incorporate all of the various aspects of ''Mass Effect'' together in a way [he] felt was largely lacking in the core adventure and the previous add-ons."&lt;ref name="GCritics review"/&gt; [[Game Revolution]]'s Eduardo Reboucas stated similar pros, but admitted that jumping on platforms with the Hammerhead goes against the nature of the game.&lt;ref name="GRev review"/&gt; Likewise, VanOrd felt that the Hammerhead goes underutilized due to its exclusive use in the pack.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; Some reviewers also criticized the simplistic vehicular combat, comparing it unfavorably with that of the original ''Mass Effect''.&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;

VanOrd gave high marks to the pack's frightening atmosphere, stating that "haunting new music instills a palpable sense of tension, and the dark interior spaces provide a sinister contrast to the shimmering waterfalls and scorching lava rivers on the planet's surface."&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; The IGN review observed that the visuals and audio surpass many side quests of the main game.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Critics also highlighted very positively the story.&lt;ref name="GRev review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCritics review"/&gt; Eurogamer opined that the ending was effective and unexpected,&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; while VanOrd remarked that the ending cutscene "features some uncomfortable images that will linger in your mind even after you've returned to the [main game]."&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; Despite evaluating the pack's short length, VanOrd concluded that ''Overlord'' "is one downloadable delight ''Mass Effect 2'' fans shouldn't miss."&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;

{{about|the Christian concept| warrior saints in Sikhism|Sant Sipahi|Christian patron saints of the military|Patron saints of the military}}
The '''military saints''' or '''warrior saints''' (also called '''soldier saints''') of the Early Christian Church are
[[Christian saints]] who were soldiers in the [[Roman Army]] during the [[persecution of Christians]], especially the [[Diocletian persecution]] of AD 303&amp;ndash;313.

Most were soldiers of the Empire who had become Christian and, after refusing to participate in [[Votum#Public vota|rituals of loyalty]] to the Emperor (see [[Imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]]), were subjected to corporal punishment including torture and [[martyr]]dom. 

Veneration of these saints, most notably of [[Saint George]], was reinforced in [[Latin Church|Western tradition]] during the time of the [[Crusades]].
The title of "[[athleta Christi|champion of Christ]]" (''athleta Christi'') was originally used for these saints, but in the [[late Middle Ages|late medieval period]] also conferred on contemporary rulers by the Pope.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Iconography==
The military saints are characteristically depicted as soldiers in traditional Byzantine iconography from about the 10th century ([[Macedonian dynasty]]) and especially also in [[Slavic Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;"The 'warrior saints' or 'military saints' can be distinguished from the huge host of martyrs by the pictorial convention of cladding them in military attire." (Grotowski 2010:2)&lt;/ref&gt; 
While early icons show the saints in "classicizing" attire, icons from the 11th and especially the 12th centuries, painted in the new style of {{lang|grc|τύπων μιμήματα}} (imitating nature), are an important source for our knowledge of medieval [[Byzantine military|Byzantine military equipment]].&lt;ref&gt;(Grotowski 2010:400)&lt;/ref&gt;

The angelic prototype of the Christian soldier-saint is the [[Archangel Michael]], whose earliest known [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] began in the 5th century with [[Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo|a shrine at]] [[Monte Gargano]].
The iconography of soldier-saints  [[Saint Theodore Tiro|Theodore]] and [[Saint George and the Dragon|George]]
as cavalrymen develops in the early medieval period.
The earliest image of St Theodore as a horseman (named in Latin) is from [[Vinica, Macedonia]] and, if genuine, dates to the 6th or 7th century. Here, Theodore is not slaying a dragon, but holding a [[Draco (military standard)|''draco'' standard]].
Three equestrian saints, Demetrius, Theodore and George, are depicted in the "Zoodochos Pigi" chapel in central Macedonia in Greece, in the prefecture of [[Kilkis (regional unit)|Kilkis]], near the modern village of Kolchida, dated to the 9th or 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;Melina Paissidou, [http://ikee.lib.auth.gr/record/278662/files/Heroes_Cults_Saints_M_Paisidu.pdf "Warrior Saints as Protectors of the Byzantine Army in the Palaiologan Period: the Case of the Rock-cut Hermitage in Kolchida (Kilkis Prefecture)"], in: Ivanka Gergova Emmanuel Moutafov (eds.), ''ГЕРОИ • КУЛТОВЕ • СВЕТЦИ / Heroes Cults Saints'' Sofija (2015), 181-198.&lt;/ref&gt;
The "dragon-slaying" motif develops in the 10th century, especially iconography seen in the  Cappadocian [[Churches of Göreme|cave churches of Göreme]], where frescoes of the 10th century show military saints on horseback confronting serpents with one, two or three heads.&lt;ref name=Stephenson179&gt;Paul Stephenson, ''The Serpent Column: A Cultural Biography'', Oxford University Press (2016),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=O72SDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA179  179&amp;ndash;182].&lt;/ref&gt;
In later medieval Byzantine iconography, the pair of horsemen is no longer identified as Theodore and George, but as George and Demetrius.

==Hagiography==
In [[Late Antiquity]] other Christian writers of [[hagiography]], like [[Sulpicius Severus]] in his account of the heroic, military life of [[Martin of Tours]], created a literary model that reflected the new spiritual, political, and social ideals of a post-Roman society.  
In a study of Anglo-Saxon soldier saints (Damon 2003), J.E. Damon has demonstrated the persistence of Sulpicius's literary model in the transformation of the pious, peaceful saints and willing martyrs of late antique hagiography to the Christian heroes of the early Middle Ages, who appealed to the newly converted societies led by professional warriors and who exemplified accommodation with and eventually active participation in holy wars that were considered just.&lt;ref&gt;Damon, John Edward. ''Soldier Saints and Holy Warriors: Warfare and Sanctity in the Literature of Early England''. (Burlington (VT): Ashgate Publishing Company), 2003, {{ISBN|0-7546-0473-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music Together''' is a music and movement program for children aged [[newborn]] through [[second grade]]. First offered to the public in 1987, the program is now offered in over 3000 communities in the [[United States]], as well as over 40 other countries around the world. This expansion has been accomplished through independent centers which are licensed to use the program. All teachers must attend and pass a Music Together teacher training.

Since its inception, Music Together has emphasized the importance of having parents and caregivers actively participate in class with their children. This is based in part on the work of early childhood educator [[Lilian Katz]], who noted that while children can learn skills and knowledge from any adult, they learn dispositions only from their loved ones; by participating in class as musical role-models, parents and caregivers help impart to their children the disposition to become lifelong music-makers.

==Philosophy==
Music Together starts with the premise that all children are musical, and that they can achieve basic music competence provided their music environment is sufficiently rich. All class activities are based on [[Developmentally Appropriate Practice]], an approach to learning that takes into account how children really learn at different developmental stages in their lives. Because very young children learn primarily through play, the program provides a fun, relaxed environment with a nonformal teaching approach.

Some critics of this and other early childhood music programs have questioned whether an organized class is necessary to teach children a basic life skill such as singing. However, children can no longer reliably learn music skills from their surrounding environment, as they could several generations ago, due to a steady decrease in live music-making activities available to them. A study done by Levinowitz &lt;ref&gt;Levinowitz, L. et al.” Measuring singing voice development in the elementary general music classroom." ''Journal of Research in Music Education,46'', Spring 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that fewer than 50% of first-graders could sing in tune.

Music learning is in many ways analogous to language learning; just as the child seems to teach their self language through interacting with a language environment, they teach their self music through being in a music environment. When adults model active singing and movement behaviors, the child imitates and learns. The combination of classroom activities and at-home music-making inspired by a recording and songbook help children learn music skills naturally and effortlessly.

==Repertoire and recordings==
Music Together is noted for a repertoire which emphasizes the use of a wide variety of [[musical modes]] (tonalities) and metres. With much of the music of our culture—especially “children’s music”—using predominantly [[major scale]]s and [[Metre (music)|duple metre]], it is difficult for children to gain a breadth of music experience. The Music Together repertoire includes songs in such tonalities as [[Phrygian mode]], [[aeolian mode]], [[Mixolydian]] mode, and [[Dorian mode]]. Children are also introduced to songs using [[triple metre]] and “unusual” metres such as 5/4 or 7/8. In this way, the Music Together repertoire helps strengthen children’s [[audiation]], a termed coined by learning theorist Edwin Gordon to describe the process by which we mentally hear and comprehend music. The ability to audiate is essential to any meaningful music learning.

There are nine non-sequential Music Together song collections, named Bongos, Bells, Triangle, Fiddle, Drum, Tambourine, Flutes, Sticks and Maracas, forming a three-year cycle taught in fall, winter, and spring semesters. There are also three summer collections, named Summer Songs I, Summer Songs II, and Summer Songs III, which are compilations carefully designed not to include songs from the spring collections before them or the fall collections after them. Families receive one CD and a code to download all of the songs each semester, along with an accompanying illustrated songbook, to facilitate at-home family music-making. The recordings are professionally produced and richly orchestrated, and feature a “family” of singers, representing a mother, father, child, grandmother, and uncle.

==History==
Music Together was founded by Kenneth K. Guilmartin, a composer and musician certified in Dalcroze [[Eurhythmics]]. In 1985 Guilmartin founded the Center for Music and Young Children (CMYC) to research and develop early childhood music programs for Birch Tree Group, Ltd., publishers of the [[Suzuki]] Method.

In 1986 Guilmartin began to collaborate with Lili M. Levinowitz, Ph.D., at that time a doctoral student directing the Children’s Music Development Program at [[Temple University]]. Levinowitz was a student of learning theorist Edwin Gordon, known for his Music Learning Theory.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Edwin E. A Music Learning Theory for Newborn and Young Children. Chicago: GIA Publication, Inc., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Guilmartin and Levinowitz were influenced by Gordon’s work, and included tonal patterns and rhythm patterns based on his work in their new program.

Music Together was first offered to the public in 1987 in a suburb of [[Philadelphia]]. After a brief residence at Westminster Conservatory of Music in [[Princeton, NJ]], the company moved to a studio on Nassau Street in Princeton in 1989, the same year that it offered its first teacher training. In 1997, the year of its tenth anniversary, the company moved to 66 Witherspoon St. in Princeton, with room for its lab school as well as offices. In 2006, the company moved into a newly renovated {{convert|15000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building in [[Hopewell, NJ]], just outside Princeton.

The '''Origins Awards''' are American awards for outstanding work in the game industry. They are presented by the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design at the [[Origins Game Fair]] on an annual basis for the previous year, so (for example) the 1979 awards were given at the 1980 [[Origins Game Fair|Origins]].

The Origins Award is commonly referred to as a [[Calliope]], as the statuette is in the likeness of the [[Muses|muse]] of the same name. Academy members frequently shorten this name to "Callie."

== History ==
Originally, the ''[[Charles S. Roberts Award]]s'' and the Origins Awards were one and the same. Starting with the 1987 awards, the Charles S. Roberts were given separately, and they moved away from [[Origins Game Fair|Origins]] entirely in 2000, leaving the Origins Awards as a completely separate system. In 1978, the awards also hosted the 1977 ''[[H. G. Wells]] awards'' for [[role-playing game]]s and [[miniature wargaming]].

== Categories ==
{{see also|Category:Origins Award winners}}
The Origins Awards were originally presented at the [[Origins Game Fair]] in five categories: ''Best Professional Game'', ''Best Amateur Game'', ''Best Professional Magazine'', ''Best Amateur Magazine'' and ''Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame''.

Since the first ceremony, the game categories have widened to include [[Board game]]s (Traditional, [[History|Historical]] and Abstract), [[Card game]]s (Traditional and [[Collectible card game|Trading]]), [[Miniature wargaming]] (Historical, [[Science fiction|Science Fiction]] and [[Fantasy]]), [[Role-playing game]]s and [[play-by-mail game]]s. There are additional categories for [[Graphic design|Graphic Design]], for game expansions and accessories, and for game-related [[fiction]]. During the 1980s and 1990s, awards were also given to [[PC game|Computer games]]. Starting in 2003, the Origins Awards began a new category called the Vanguard Award, which honored highly innovative games.

'''P. W. Halton''' (22 April 1841 &amp;ndash; 7 June 1909), was an [[Ireland|Irish]]-born conductor.  He is best known for his long tenure as music director and conductor of [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] touring companies during the original runs and early revivals of the [[Savoy opera|Savoy Operas]], including many of the New York premieres.

==Life and career==
Patrick William Halton was born in [[Mullingar]], Ireland, and died in Manchester, England.  For nearly 25 years, Halton served as one of D'Oyly Carte's leading provincial musical directors.  Halton was the father of Frederick J. Halton, the author of "The Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Operas: A Concordance" (New York, Bass, 1935).

In the early to mid-1870s, Halton moved to London and worked in a music store, playing the organ in a local church, and giving music lessons.  He also conducted at various music halls during this time.  In 1876, he was hired as a conductor by the Theatre Royal, in Manchester.

===Early years and premieres===
In December 1879, D'Oyly Carte hired Halton in Hastings as music director for one of its touring companies, presenting ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]''.  In 1880 he toured with ''Pinafore'' and ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', along with shorter [[Savoy opera|companion pieces]], and in December 1880, the company began to play ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''.  Among the companion pieces included on this tour was Halton's own composition ''Six and Six'', a one-act operetta with words by B. T. Hughes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/companions/six/index.html Information about ''Six and Six'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1881, Halton traveled to America to music direct ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', at the Standard Theatre in New York, until March 1882.  During the last month he also conducted [[Henry Pottinger Stephens]] and [[Edward Solomon]]'s ''[[Claude Duval (opera)|Claude Duval]]'', alternating with ''Patience''.  He then returned to England to music direct ''Patience'' on tour until December 1883.  Next, beginning in February 1884, was ''[[Princess Ida]]''.  Then, beginning in February 1885, ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' and ''Sorcerer'' were played in repertory with ''Princess Ida''.

Back in New York, at the [[Fifth Avenue Theatre]], Halton music directed the American premiere of ''[[The Mikado]]'' from August 1885 to April 1886.  He then toured with ''Pinafore'' and ''The Mikado'', first in England and then took in Germany and Austria, until January 1887. He then returned to New York and the Fifth Avenue Theatre, with most of the same principals, for the premiere of ''[[Ruddigore]]'', which ran until April.  He was back to Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and then Britain with ''Patience'' and ''The Mikado'' until December 1887.

In 1888, Halton toured with a repertory consisting at various times of ''Pinafore'', ''Patience'', ''The Mikado'' and ''Pirates'', until October.  On November 1, 1888, he began a tour of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', which ran for over a year.  In January 1890, Halton was back in New York music directing the ill-starred premiere of ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' at the Park Theatre.  The weak cast meant a disaster, and Carte and Halton assembled a new cast for a re-launch on February 18 at Palmer's Theatre, which was better received.

===Later years===
Halton was called back to England to begin touring in March, 1890 with ''The Gondoliers'' until December.  After this, they added shows in repertory, including ''The Mikado'' in December 1890 and ''Yeomen'' in January 1891.  On 4 September 1891, he conducted ''The Mikado'' for [[Queen Victoria]] at [[Balmoral Castle]] &amp;ndash; an assignment that the patriotic Irishman accepted grudgingly.  In October 1891, ''Iolanthe'' was added to the company's repertory, and from January to July 1892 they also included ''[[The Nautch Girl]]''.  The company continued to add more shows: ''Patience'' in August 1892, ''Pirates'' in May 1893, ''Pinafore'' and ''Trial'' in January 1894, ''The Sorcerer'' in April 1895, the curtain raiser ''Cox and Box'' in May, and ''Princess Ida'' in December 1895.  The repertoire was now eleven, and the tour continued through 1896.

In late November 1896, Halton sailed for South Africa for an ambitious tour through June 1897. It embraced all the Gilbert and Sullivan operas Halton had been conducting, except ''Princess Ida'', and also included ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' and ''[[The Grand Duke]]''.  Halton toured Britain from December 1897 with most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas plus, briefly, ''His Majesty''.  Over the next six-and-a-half years, with Halton as their musical director, the same touring company played all the G &amp; S operas except ''Ruddigore'' and ''The Grand Duke'' plus, in 1900, ''[[The Rose of Persia]]''.

Halton retired on June 18, 1904.

'''Pacific Institute of Culinary Arts''', founded in 1996, is a privately run culinary school located just outside the entrance of [[Granville Island]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]]. The school is fully accredited by the Private Career Training Institutions Agency of British Columbia until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picachef.com/program_affiliations.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diploma Programs==

The Pacific Institute of Culinary Arts offers [[diplomas]] both in [[Culinary Arts]] and Pastry Arts; each full-time program runs for 6 months. Classes are held 5 days a week, running approximately 7 hours per day for a total of 917 hours. Four sessions per year are offered, starting in September, January, March and June. The classes are 90% hands-on, the chef-student ratio is 1:15 for Culinary Arts &lt;ref&gt;http://www.picachef.com/culinary_arts.html&lt;/ref&gt; and 1:12 for Pastry Arts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picachef.com/baking_pastry_arts.html&lt;/ref&gt; All chef instructors are European-trained and have at least 10 years experience. 

As of September 2010, approximately 2000 students, from Canada and other nations, have graduated from both programs. Applicants do not need to have any prior kitchen experience, but a high school diploma and the ability to read, write and speak English is required.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picachef.com/faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt; The programs are intended to give students a solid foundation of theoretical and practical training to improve their chances of success in the industry, but they should not expect to go from school directly to an Executive [[Chef]] position.

==Restaurant and Bakeshop==

Culinary students work in the kitchen and in the front of the house as wait staff, while the pastry students make [[bread]] and [[pastries]] for the restaurant and bakeshop.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9903">'''Paranoid fiction''' is a term sometimes used to describe works of [[literature]] that explore the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] nature of reality and how it can be manipulated by forces in power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/new_literary_history/v028/28.1flieger.html Postmodern Perspective: The Paranoid Eye. ''New Literary History''.Volume 28, Number 1, Winter 1997, pp. 87-109]&lt;/ref&gt;  These forces can be external, such as a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] government, or they can be internal, such as a character's [[mental illness]] or refusal to accept the harshness of the world he or she is in.

Unlike [[speculative fiction]], paranoid fiction is written in a way so as to imply that the story may only be a [[delusion]] of the characters, instead of treating it as an [[alternate history]] or an [[fictional universe|in-fiction universe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==History==
The elements of paranoid fiction can be seen in works dating as far back as the late 19th and early 20th century. Some of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novels contained paranoid and psychologically troubled characters set against the dark backdrop of a modernizing [[Russia]]. [[Franz Kafka]], in particular, was known for his exaggerated accounts of what he portrayed as real life in his works, to enhance the absurdity of the life themes they conveyed.  Similarly, [[George Orwell]]'s works, while not as exaggerated, confirmed the practice of using [[dystopia]]n fiction to take a different outlook on highly common themes, including identity and personal desires.

The term ''paranoid fiction'' was first coined to label sensationalistic and off-beat stories as bizarre and thus outside the realm of literary fiction.  Starting after [[World War I]], however, [[modernism|modernists]] began exploring the stranger themes of life in art, in response to the themes of death being effectively mechanized and made impossible to toy with by the war's graphic depictions.  As a result, modernist literature tended to explore the meaning and construction of reality, shifting away from the progressive, cause-and-effect structure of [[Literary realism|realist]] fiction towards a more complex and disjointed depiction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Lye, John (1997). [http://www.brocku.ca/english/courses/2F55/modernism.html "Some Attributes of Modernist Literature."]&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], [[absurdism|absurdists]] carried this focus one step further by placing these common themes in surreal and fantastic settings, turning what would have been otherwise mundane concepts into distinctive, stand-out ones, thus converting the paranoid fiction genre into a legitimate one.

[[Philip K. Dick]] is most frequently viewed as the forefather of the modern paranoid fiction.  His works were born out of paranoia and hallucination; he had sudden visions of places he'd never been to and events he'd never witnessed, possibly from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] or an overly active imagination.  These visions were so vivid that Dick put them down on paper, never failing to classify them as only "speculative thought," and thus outside the boundary of conventional thought.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Erik. [http://www.techgnosis.com/pkdnet.html "Philip K. Dick's Divine Interference."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205050412/http://techgnosis.com/pkdnet.html |date=2006-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Dick's works start out uneventfully in a seemingly ordinary setting, then transpose to a [[surrealism|surrealistic]] [[fantasy]], with the characters discovering that what they thought real was in fact a delusion.  Throughout his works, Dick maintained a balance between the expected traits of the [[science fiction]] genre they were also categorized in, and the eccentric and disturbing elements coming from his mind.&lt;ref name="paranoid"&gt;[http://www.strangewords.com/archive/paranoia.html "Strange Words: Paranoid."]&lt;/ref&gt;  A recurring theme in his works is on how reality is perceived and treated differently by people depending on their mindsets.

==Characteristics==

At its most basic, paranoid fiction refers specifically to works about speculations and possible conspiracies by people in power, told by an [[unreliable narrator]].&lt;ref name="paranoid"/&gt;  However, the most popular type of paranoid fiction has proved to be one in which the universe appears on the surface to be definite and real, but upon closer inspection, to actually be deceptive and deliberately misleading.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  In these works, there are either questions raised as to the realness of the world the characters are living in, or a distinction made between a fantasy world and its reality.

Paranoid fiction often overlaps with many other genres, most commonly [[dystopia]]n fiction, [[science fiction]], and [[film noir]], sharing many of its main themes and literary devices.  Generally, however, paranoid fiction avoids explicitly defined themes and concrete [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s in favor of [[allegory|allegories]] and ambiguous [[symbol]]ism to emphasize the dreamlike and unreal nature of the characters' world.&lt;ref name="sanmasonic"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027080230/http://geocities.com/sanmasonic/Paranoid/ "Paranoid Fiction."]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a purely dystopian work typically explores the mechanisms and motives of the totalitarian state to keep its people under control, whereas one of paranoid fiction would concentrate more on the effects of the state on its inhabitants' mental and [[emotional well-being]], and its implications on the decadent condition of society.  George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' can be viewed as a balance of the two, depicting the Party as crushing free will through a strictly defined [[Newspeak|language]] and constant monitoring, but also through psychological torture and the distorting of people's viewpoints on what is true and what is false.

To further increase their "[[magic realism]]," works of paranoid fiction often employ common devices and archetypes from other genres, including a detective-solving structure, plot twists, or philosophical themes, to create a [[surrealism|surrealistic]] tone and an atmosphere of fear and dread.  Plots also tend to be fanciful and occasionally futuristic to emphasize their inherent absurdity and imaginativeness, but also maintain some measure of realism to comment on how apparently unrealistic stories can, in fact, be (often frighteningly) closer to real life than one might think at first glance.&lt;ref name="sanmasonic"/&gt;

Sometimes paranoid fiction will strongly imply, and occasionally admit outright, that its constructed world is a lie or an illusion.  In this case, the plot will center on the main character's struggle between the physical and spiritual; i.e. the actual world they are in, versus the world they want to see and believe in. Here, the cause of the fantasy is the protagonist's internal desires, doubts, and suspicions.  Such works tend to be more introspective and focused on the individual, than on a community or a regime.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

[[File:Institute of Painters in Watercolours (1).jpg|thumb|Premises at Picadilly 1883{{ndash}}1970]]

The '''Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours''' ('''RI'''), initially called the '''New Society of Painters in Water Colours''', is one of the societies in the [[Federation of British Artists]], based in the [[Mall Galleries]] in London.

==History==
In 1831 the society was founded as the ''New Society of Painters in Water Colours'', competing with the [[Royal Watercolour Society]] (RWS), which had been founded in 1804. The founding members were [[William Cowen]], James Fudge, Thomas Maisey (treasurer), O. F. Phillips, Joseph Powell (president), [[W. B. S. Taylor]], and [[Thomas Charles Wageman]]. The New Society differed from the RWS in policy, by exhibiting non-members' work also. Both societies challenged the [[Royal Academy]]'s refusal to accept the medium of [[watercolour]]s as appropriate for serious art.

In 1839 Henry Warren (1794–1879) became president of the society and was re-elected for many years until he resigned due to failing eyesight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Henry Warren, K.L.|journal=[[The Artist and Journal of Home Culture]]|date=15 January 1880|page=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fTEFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863 there was a name change to the ''Institute of Painters in Water Colours''. In 1883 it acquired its own premises at [[Piccadilly]], across the road from the Royal Academy. In 1885 it added "Royal" to its title by command of [[Queen Victoria]]. When the lease to the Piccadilly premises ran out in 1970, it moved to the [[Mall Galleries]], near to [[Trafalgar Square]]. The Institute's 207th Exhibition takes place at the Mall Galleries between 3-18 April 2019.

===Royal Institute Galleries===
The premises at 190-195 Piccadilly hosted many exhibitions by other societies and were known simply as "Royal Institute Galleries".&lt;ref name="london1951"&gt;{{cite book |title=London Night and Day, 1951: A Guide to Where the Other Books Don’t Take You |date=2014 |publisher=Old House Books |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-EvDCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT60&amp;ots=9dhZd3yG9z&amp;dq=%22royal%20institute%20galleries%22&amp;pg=PT60#v=onepage&amp;q=%22royal%20institute%20galleries%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now a grade II [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|desc=Former Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours premises, now forming part of Prince's House|num=1265805|access-date=18 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Number 195 is now home to [[BAFTA]].&lt;ref name="bafta"&gt;{{cite web |title=Welcome to BAFTA 195 Piccadilly |url=http://www.bafta.org/195-piccadilly/welcome |publisher=BAFTA |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rubens saturn.jpg|thumb|290px]]
'''''Saturn''''' or '''''Saturn Devouring His Son''''' is a 1636 painting by the Flemish artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]], now in the [[Museo del Prado]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/genios/cuadros/1191.htm Artehistoria entry for the painting]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was commissioned for the [[Torre de la Parada]] by [[Philip IV of Spain]] and shows the influence of [[Michelangelo]] on Rubens, which he had picked up on his journey to Italy. The three stars at the top of the painting represent the planet [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] as described by [[Galileo]] a few years before its painting. The central star is the planet itself, whilst the two others represent what he thought were two stars aligned with the planet. In reality, these were the [[Rings of Saturn|rings around the planet]], which his telescope was not powerful enough to distinguish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpais.com/sociedad/2009/10/23/actualidad/1256248803_850215.html) 'The Triple Star' in ''Saturn Devouring His Son'' (EL PAIS 23/10/2009)]
&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, the painting influenced [[Goya]]'s [[Saturn Devouring His Son|painting of the same subject]] (1819–23).

'''Sky Angel'''  is an American operator of [[Christian media|Christian television]] networks; it operates three channels, Angel One, Angel Two, and [[Kids &amp; Teens TV|KTV]], all of which are exclusive to [[Dish Network]]. The company's corporate headquarters are located in [[Naples, Florida]].&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt; The company also operates a [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] location where programming, engineering and network operations reside.&lt;ref name="forbes-skyangel" /&gt;

The company previously operated as a Christian-oriented [[television provider]] carrying religious and family-oriented programming, first as a [[satellite television]] service, and later as an [[over-the-top content|over-the-top]] [[internet television]] provider. The shift to an IPTV platform was later accompanied by the spin-off of the provider's secular offerings into a second service known as FAVE TV. On January 14, 2014, Sky Angel ceased its IPTV business, citing that because it didn't fall under the traditional legal definition of a [[multichannel video programming distributor]], it was unable to employ legal remedies for its allegations that broadcasters were discriminating against its business model by preventing carriage of their channels.

==History==
Sky Angel was formed in 1980 by Robert Johnson Sr., who aimed to create a faith-oriented television service that would be free of the objectionable content he had found on television. Johnson obtained an allocation of 8 [[direct-broadcast satellite]] frequencies for the service, and reached a deal with [[Dish Network]] to use space on its [[EchoStar III]] satellite. Sky Angel's lineup would consist primarily of [[Religious broadcasting|religious networks]], along with other secular television networks which the service considered to be family-oriented. Carrying around 30 channels in its lineup, Sky Angel reached around 115,000 subscribers, mostly within the [[Central United States]].&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6523982.html|title='Christ-Centered' IPTV Service to Offer NFL Network|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes-skyangel&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tiny TV Broadcaster That Cable And Internet Giants Are Trying To Kill|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2012/08/23/the-tiny-tv-broadcaster-that-cable-and-internet-giants-are-trying-to-kill/|work=Forbes|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mc-spread"/&gt;

After the company declined to invest close to $400 million in manufacturing a replacement for the aging EchoStar III satellite, Sky Angel partnered with [[NeuLion]] in 2007 to develop a new [[Over-the-top content|over-the-top]] [[IPTV]]-based platform for the service. The new IPTV service would offer additional features such as an increased channel capacity, support for [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]s, and the ability for Sky Angel to offer [[Internet television|internet]] and [[mobile television]] services in the future.&lt;ref name=forbes-skyangel/&gt;&lt;ref name="mc-spread"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/telco-tv/sky-angel-spread-iptv-wings-neulion/127630|title=Sky Angel to Spread IPTV Wings via NeuLion|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Sky Angel launched its "Sky Angel 2.0" platform, offering services featuring religious channels delivered via set-top boxes, and "Faith Everywhere", which added web streaming of its lineup through an [[iPad]] app. Sky Angel also introduced a new spin-off service known as FAVE TV ("Family and Values Entertainment"){{emdash}}a secular service which aimed to carry "mainstream" and "family-friendly" television channels.&lt;ref name=forbes-skyangel/&gt;&lt;ref name=skyangel-favepr&gt;{{cite web|title=Sky Angel Launches Sky Angel 2.0 and Creates New Television Service, FAVE TV, With the Help of NeuLion's TV Everywhere Technology|url=http://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/sky-angel-launches-sky-angel-152949069.html|publisher=NeuLion press release|accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the Faith Everywhere service became available through an app for [[Roku]] [[digital media player]]s.&lt;ref name=mc-skyangelroku&gt;{{cite web|title=Sky Angel’s ‘Faith Everywhere’ Package Runs $14.95 Per Month on the Streaming Platform|url=http://www.multichannel.com/distribution/roku-tunes-sky-angel/143653|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2014, Sky Angel suspended its television services; in an FCC complaint, the company detailed that it had been unable to offer a competitive service to its subscribers because content providers (including in particular, [[#Carriage disputes|Discovery Communications]]) had refused to allow the provider to "acquire programming in a fair and nondiscriminatory way".&lt;ref name=fcc-shutdown&gt;{{cite web|title=SUPPLEMENTAL COMMENTS OF SKY ANGEL U.S., LLC|url=http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=7521313509|publisher=FCC|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=recode-fcceffort&gt;{{cite web|title=FCC Launches Effort to Help Online Video Providers Compete With Cable Guys|url=https://www.recode.net/2014/12/19/11633938/fcc-launches-effort-to-help-online-video-providers-compete-with-cable|website=Re/code|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming and services==
Sky Angel previously offered two programming packages for its IPTV service: the base "Faith Package", which consisted of primarily faith-based broadcasters (including various Evangelical Protestant and [[Roman Catholic]] broadcasters, and accompanying video on demand services)&lt;ref name="Catholic"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=11794 |title= Sky Angel IPTV service includes five Catholic channels |accessdate= 2008-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the "Family Values Pack" added a selection of secular cable networks, including general entertainment, news, and sports. Sky Angel also offered a subscription "WebTV" package, which included a selection of around 35 of the service's faith-based channels available for live streaming on the Sky Angel website, along with video on demand content.&lt;ref name="SKY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyangel.com/About/Faq.asp?ws=s&amp;x=002|004&amp;~=|title=Sky Angel: FAQ|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carriage disputes ==
Sky Angel's switch to an over-the-top IPTV service led to several major carriage disputes, which led to concerns over the definition of Sky Angel's service under the regulations of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).

In 2009, [[C-SPAN]] was pulled from Sky Angel after being on its IPTV service for 2 days. In November 2012, Sky Angel filed an [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] lawsuit against the network claiming that its owners (a consortium of major television providers) pulled its programming from Sky Angel to put the service at a disadvantage against its conventional rivals. The court dismissed the case without prejudice, believing that Sky Angel's case did not have enough evidence to justify its claims that C-SPAN's owners were trying to enforce a monopoly position. C-SPAN denied Sky Angel's arguments, and claimed the removal was for contractual reasons relating to IPTV. Sky Angel, in its filing with the court, showed that CSPAN was already streaming its channels over the web to the public free of charge.&lt;ref name=mcn-skyangelcspan&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Dismisses Sky Angel Suit Against C-SPAN|url=http://www.multichannel.com/index.php?q=news-article/court-dismisses-sky-angel-suit-against-c-span/143639|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the company subsequently filed a second antitrust suit. The claims were rejected, with the court arguing once again that Sky Angel had produced no actual evidence of [[collusion]] among the C-SPAN consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/washington/strike-two-sky-angel-antitrust-claim-against-c-span/130154|title=Strike Two For Sky Angel Antitrust Claim Against C-SPAN|website=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, [[Discovery Communications]] announced that it would pull its channels from Sky Angel in response to unspecified concerns surrounding how its programming was delivered. In response, Sky Angel filed a [[Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act|program access]] complaint with the [[Federal Communications Commission]], alleging that Discovery was discriminating against the service by allowing other major cable providers to offer access to its programming over the internet (either through a [[TV Everywhere]] service, or through [[Dish Network]]'s [[Slingbox]]-based set-top boxes). The FCC denied Sky Angel's request for a standstill on the case, but the FCC Media Bureau began to dispute whether Sky Angel qualified as a "[[multichannel video programming distributor]]" (MVPD) under the regulations because it does not have a physical "transmission path" in its infrastructure. The Commission, along with allies such as [[Google]], acknowledged that making any ruling on whether an over-the-top service qualifies as an MVPD may have a major effect on the [[internet video]] industry as a whole.&lt;ref name=forbes-skyangel/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcn-skyangelcomplaint&gt;{{cite web|title=Sky Angel Files Program Access Complaint Against Discovery|url=http://www.multichannel.com/internet-video/sky-angel-files-program-access-complaint-against-discovery/131059|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcn-bedeviled&gt;{{cite web|title=Bedeviled By Sky Angel Decision|url=http://www.multichannel.com/content/bedeviled-sky-angel-decision|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcn-fearandloathing&gt;{{cite web|title=Fear and Loathing Over The Top|url=http://www.multichannel.com/content/fear-and-loathing-over-top|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8239">The imitation of [[natural sounds]] in various cultures is a diverse phenomenon and can fill in various functions. In several instances, it is related to the belief system ([[yoik]]s of the [[Sami people|Sami]],&lt;ref name=shamyoik&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 56, 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spell&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ykt&gt;[http://www.uit.no/ssweb/dok/Somby/Ande/95.htm Somby 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080325110925/http://www.uit.no/ssweb/dok/Somby/Ande/95.htm |date=2008-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yoikbel&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 74&lt;/ref&gt; some other shamanic songs and rituals,&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=calf&gt;Hoppál 2005: 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bear&gt;[http://haldjas.folklore.ee/~aado/tent.htm Lintrop]&lt;/ref&gt; [[overtone singing]] of some cultures). It may serve also such practical goals as luring in the hunt;&lt;ref name=natt/&gt; or entertainment ([[katajjaq]]s of [[Inuit]]).&lt;ref name=natt/&gt;&lt;ref name=desch/&gt;

Among some peoples of the [[Altai-Sayan region]], including [[Tofalar|Tofa]], the ability to mimic sounds of the environment includes hunting calls, and is present also in a traditional singing tradition preserved only by some old people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Song ond sound mimesis|publisher=Foundation for Endangered Languages |url=http://www.ogmios.org/164.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fields ==
=== Shamanism ===
{{Main|Imitation of sounds in shamanism}}
[[Shamanism]] in various cultures shows great diversity.&lt;ref name=div&gt;Hoppál 2005: 15&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, the music or songs related to shamanistic practice may mimic natural sounds, sometimes with [[onomatopoiea]].&lt;ref name=onom&gt;[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf  Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entertainment ===

The intention to mimic natural sounds is not necessarily linked to shamanistic beliefs or practice alone. [[Katajjaq]] (a "genre" of [[Inuit music|music of some Inuit groups]]) is a game played by women, for entertainment. In some instances, [[natural sounds]] (mostly those of animals, e.g. geese) are imitated.&lt;ref name=natt&gt;Nattiez: 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=desch&gt;[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm Deschênes 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Luring animals ===

The kind of [[katajjaq]] mentioned above, which mimics the cry of geese, shows some similarities with the practice of the hunters to lure game.&lt;ref name=natt/&gt;

Some Eskimo peoples used a tool (shaped like a claw) to scratch the ice of the frozen sea in order to attract seals.&lt;ref&gt;Burch &amp; Forman 1988: 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birket-Smith 1969: 127&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sughra Rababi''' (1922 – 1994) was an artist from Pakistan. As a young female artist in the 1940s, she was the first woman to win the All India Painting Competition Award. A versatile painter, designer and sculptor - Rababi was truly a woman far ahead of her times.

Rababi donated most of the proceeds from sales of her art to support humanitarian causes. In recognition and memory of her artistic and charitable contributions, [[UNICEF]] created a Sughra Rababi Fund and the Mayor of San Francisco declared 19 January 1994, as Sughra Rababi Day in San Francisco.

Rababi, an accomplished Pakistani painter, did her graduate studies at the Saranagati School of Art in Karachi and her post-graduate studies at the Shantiniketan Fine Arts University in Bengal, India. Her art career spanned more than five decades and she exhibited her works in solo and group exhibitions throughout her life. Her last solo exhibition was held in 1992 in San Francisco, California. Rababi’s art was original and her style, versatile and truly her own. 
She was a prolific artist and created  landscapes, figurative and calligraphic paintings and used tempera, oil and acrylic as her mediums. Rababi was also a designer and a sculptor.

Posthumous reproductions of her art are sold to support humanitarian causes.&lt;ref&gt;'Art for a Cause' by Professor Karrar Hussain in 'The News'. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Smoldering Shades of Passion' by Marjorie Hussain in 'The Dawn'. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Spirit of Sughra Rababi' by Salwat Ali in 'The Dawn'. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Sughra Rababi' by David Douglas Duncan in 'The World of Allah'. 1982.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2683">{{About|the symphony by Howard Hanson|the symphony by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]|A Sea Symphony}}

The seventh [[symphony]] by [[Howard Hanson]], subtitled '''''A Sea Symphony''''', is a [[choral symphony]] commissioned by the [[National Music Camp]] in 1974 to commemorate its fiftieth season at [[Interlochen]], Michigan in 1977. It was first performed at the 1977 Interlochen Summer Music Camp by the International Youth Orchestra with singers made up of other students, staff and faculty. It was conducted by the composer.

Dedicated to Joseph. E. Maddy, founder of Interlochen and a close friend of Hanson, this was the last major symphonic work written by Hanson. Like [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s first symphony and the symphony for voices by [[Roy Harris]], Hanson's symphony is set to texts from ''[[Leaves of Grass]]'' by [[Walt Whitman]] describing the a voyage of ocean exploration as a metaphor of life transiting into death.

About composing the work, Hanson remarked, "I had wanted to write the piece all my life and when I finally got at it — I was eighty — I had no trouble. It came out just as if I were thirty or even twenty-five, and I had no inhibitions about it. I didn't work on it, I didn't go over it, I didn't redo it — whoosh — it came like that!"&lt;ref&gt;David Russell Williams in ''Perspectives of New Music'', Vol. 20, No. 1/2 (Autumn, 1981 - Summer, 1982), pp. 12-25,&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony is set in three movements:
*"Lo! The Unbounded Sea" (largamente);
*"The Untold Want" (Adagio);
*"Joy! Shipmate, Joy!" (Allegretto molto).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2826">[[Allan Pettersson]] wrote his '''Symphony No. 9''' in 1970.

The symphony is his last composition preceding a nine-month stay in hospital (starting September 1970);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Pettersson Bio|url=http://home.arcor.de/teoskueche/teo/apbio.htm|accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is also his longest symphony.&lt;ref&gt;the average length in the three commercial recordings so far is around 70 minutes.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is one [[movement (music)|movement]], though it divides into a number of smaller sections that follow each other with at most nominal pause but usually none.&lt;ref name="cpo"/&gt;  The notes to the cpo recording identify 17 such sections, partially for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer: "The tracks are in no way to be understood as separate movements but do represent attempts to identify breaks or turning points in the score."&lt;/ref&gt;

Much though not all of the material in the symphony is based on the ascending scale motif heard at the very beginning, played by [[bassoon]]s, [[viola]]s and [[cello]]s.&lt;ref name="cpo"&gt;Meyer, Andreas K.W., translated by Susan Marie Praeder: notes to the [[Classic Produktion Osnabrück|cpo]] recording.&lt;/ref&gt; The concluding bars of the symphony&lt;ref&gt;cpo recording, track 17, from three measures before rehearsal 208 in the score to the end - about 5 minutes&lt;/ref&gt; are described by [[Peter Ruzicka]] as a Canto whose main theme goes from violins and cellos to violas in unison, and which ends in a slow cadence into [[F major]].

Pettersson dedicated the symphony to [[Sergiu Comissiona]] and the [[Gothenburg Symphony]], who premiered it on 18 February 1971 &lt;ref name="cpo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Allan Pettersson's 9th Symphony|last=Rapoport|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Rapoport (music researcher)|jstor=944238|journal=Tempo, New Series|number=118|date=September 1976|pages=47–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had commissioned it for the 350th Anniversary of the Founding of the City of Gothenburg.&lt;ref name="cpo"/&gt;

The miniature score was published in 1989 by Nordiska Musikforlaget of Stockholm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=3334864&amp;DB=local|title=Permanent Link for Cornell Card of Score|accessdate=25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and runs to 385 pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7183">The '''Symphony in C major''', [[Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis|WWV]] 29, is the only completed [[symphony]] of [[Richard Wagner]].

== Form ==
The Symphony in C major is in four [[movement (music)|movements]]:
* I. Sostenuto e maestoso - Allegro con brio (475 [[bar (music)|bars]])
* II. Andante ma non troppo, un poco maestoso (208 bars)
* III. Allegro assai (447 bars)
* IV. Allegro molto e vivace. (442 bars).

The performance time is approximately 35 minutes.

The first movement is in [[sonata form]] movement prefaced by a slow introduction. The second movement is in the key of A minor; the overall shape is A + B + B + A + [[coda (music)|coda]], a strong contrast existing between the lyrical A and the signal-like B ideas. The movement begins with a motif from the coda of the first movement. The third movement is a [[scherzo]] and [[Trio (music)#Musical form|trio]] with the traditional structure A + B + A + B + A + coda. The scherzo is characterised by a dynamic rhythm, whilst the trio (''un poco meno allegro'') features a contrasting smooth melodic line. The fourth movement is structured in the same classical sonata form as the opening movement. The idea which follows the presentation of the first theme is equivocal in [[tonality]]. Wagner accelerates the tempo (''più allegro'') half way through the coda to generate increased excitement as the music moves towards its close.

== Instrumentation ==
The symphony is scored for 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s in C, 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]] in C, 2 [[trumpet]]s in C, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[timpani]] and [[String section|strings]].

== Composition ==
According to Wagner himself, in a letter to a friend, he composed the symphony in the brief space of six weeks at the beginning of the summer of 1832. The composition shows the influence of the symphonies of Beethoven (especially nos. 3, 5 and 7) and also of the late symphonies of Mozart.&lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 309.&lt;/ref&gt; The orchestration is in the style of [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]. The work shows the composer's inexperience (he was less than 20 years old when writing it), in particular in a so-called diffuseness of the first and second movements.&lt;ref&gt;Overbeeke (2012) 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|reason=one persons opinion|date=December 2017}}

Wagner also started in 1834 an incomplete symphony in E major (WWV35), of which only the first movement and part of the second movement exist.&lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early performances==
The symphony was performed in rehearsal by a student orchestra at the [[Prague Conservatory]] in November 1832, conducted by [[Bedřich Diviš Weber|Dionys Weber]], with Wagner in attendance.  It received its first public performance on 15 December, at the ''Euterpe'' music society in [[Leipzig]], conducted by Wagner's early teacher, Christian Gottlieb Müller.&lt;ref name="Deathridge 2008 180"&gt;Deathridge (2008) 180&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clara Schumann|Clara Wieck]] described the performance in a letter to her later husband [[Robert Schumann]] dated 17 December 1832:
:"Father  [ [[Friedrich Wieck]] ] went to the Euterpe hall on Saturday. Listen! Herr Wagner has got ahead of you; a symphony of his was performed, which is said to be as like as two peas to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Symphony in A major]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Newman (1976) 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second public performance was at the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus]] on 10 January 1833, as part of the annual subscription concerts.&lt;ref name="Deathridge 2008 180"/&gt; The work received another performance at [[Würzburg]] on 27 August 1833.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

The score was subsequently thought to have been lost after Wagner presented it to [[Felix Mendelssohn]] in 1836 (see below), but the parts from the Prague performance were found in [[Dresden]] in 1877 in a trunk which had been left behind by Wagner when he fled the city in 1849. The work was performed again at Christmas 1882, two months before Wagner's death, for the birthday of Wagner's wife [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]] at the [[La Fenice]] theatre  [[Venice]]; it was conducted by Wagner and by [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]].&lt;ref name="Newman 1976, 96, n"&gt;Newman (1976), 96, n.&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner made several revisions to the full score for the performance.&lt;ref&gt;Overbeeke (2012) 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent  "Essay on the Revival of Youthful Works" he wrote: "If there is anything at all in this work which shows the mark of Richard Wagner, it is the fact that it is not polluted by the hypocritical stance which was to appear later and which Germans find very difficult to get the better of, and the fact that, from the outset, he remained true to himself and was unwilling to be deflected from his proper course."

==Mendelssohn and Wagner's Symphony==
The same 1882 essay contains a passage in which Wagner implies that Mendelssohn had tried to deliberately suppress the Symphony.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Deathridge (2008), 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The score had in fact been given by Wagner to Mendelssohn as a gift, as is demonstrable from a letter written by Wagner on 11 April 1836; Wagner perhaps had a grievance that Mendelssohn had not subsequently conducted it.&lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976), 95 n.2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 Wagner told Cosima that he thought Mendelssohn had destroyed the score "perhaps because he detected in it a talent which was disagreeable to him."&lt;ref name="Newman 1976, 96, n"/&gt; This invention was of a piece with Wagner's [[antisemitic]] attitude to Mendelssohn.&lt;ref&gt;Deathridge (2008), 182-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Piano duet version==
Fragments exist of a [[piano duet]] version of the Symphony in Wagner's hand, probably prepared in 1832 or 1833. Most of the first movement is in the [[Stefan Zweig Collection]] at the [[British Library]]; other movements are at the [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington DC]].&lt;ref&gt;Searle (1999), 129-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ten women from Stralsund''''' (''in contemporary dress'') is a pencil drawing in brown ink by [[Melchior Lorck]] from about 1571.

== Description ==
The dimensions are  22.2 x 31.3 cm.

The artwork is part of a series of drawings, which is believed to have served as sketches for woodcuts to illustrate a planned book on the history of clothing. It shows ten women, who are lined up and show off outfits from the 16th century. The women take different poses, and this allows Melchior Lorck to display their clothing from different angles.

== Provenance ==
The drawing was purchased with funds from the Konsul George Jorck and Wife Emma Jorck's Foundation from the [[Evelyn collection]] at auction at [[Sotheby]]'s in March 1966. It is available now at [[National Gallery of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8924">'''Terence Albert Ladd Rees''' (24 February 1928 – 15 November 2014) was a [[microbiologist]] but was best known as a collector of material relating to the theatre and music in [[Wales]] and Britain.  He was also a published theatre historian and researcher, and, in particular, was an authority on the works of [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]] who, as [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], wrote 14 [[comic opera]]s in the late [[Victorian era]].

==Biography==
Rees was born at [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] in [[Glamorgan]], educated at the local county school, the [[University of Cardiff]] (1948–1952), and the [[University of London]] (1954–1957). He spent 1965 to 1967 as a Research Fellow at the ''Institute of Diseases of the Chest'' at [[Brompton, Kensington|Brompton]] in London, and between 1967 and 1981 he lectured in microbiology at The Institute of Laryngology and Otology at [[University College London]].  Rees later resided in [[Powys]] and in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]]. Rees was an avid researcher of theatrical topics, and his oft-cited 1978 book, ''Theatre Lighting in the Age of Gas'', has been called "(aptly) illuminating, and pleasantly non-technical."&lt;ref&gt;Trussler, Simon (ed.).

After considerable research about Gilbert and Sullivan's first collaboration, ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'', Rees developed, and in 1964 published, a version of the libretto for that work that attempts to correct the many errors noted in the surviving libretto, as part of his book ''Thespis – A Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Enigma''.&lt;ref&gt;Rees (1964), pp. 101–45&lt;/ref&gt; Rees also prepared a performance version, based on the libretto, which included a few interpolated lyrics from Gilbert's non-Sullivan operas in an attempt to replace the missing songs.  A score was supplied by Garth Morton, based on music from lesser-known Sullivan operas, and this version was premiered in 1962 at the University of London and recorded in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/thespis/thespis.pdf Annotated libretto to ''Thespis'', prepared by Ian Bond, noting Rees' additions for the performance version.] The interpolated songs do not appear in Rees' 1964 book.

"Dr Terence Rees", Obituaries, ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan News'', Vol. V, No. 7, Spring 2015, London: The Gilbert and Sullivan Society, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Rees collected a number of original Sullivan manuscripts, including the operas ''[[The Zoo]]'', ''[[The Contrabandista]]'', ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'', ''[[The Chieftain]]'', and ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'', and several major Sullivan orchestral pieces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arcadia.org/pml/pml-gs-collection-1996.html Ric Wilson website containing information about G&amp;S collections] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901093257/http://arcadia.org/pml/pml-gs-collection-1996.html |date=2007-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He purchased several of these at auction in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;Sotheby &amp; Co Catalogue, 13 June 1966&lt;/ref&gt; following the death of the widow of Arthur Sullivan's nephew [[Herbert Sullivan]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 14 June 1966, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert had inherited the scores on his uncle's death, and on his own death in 1928 they passed to his wife, who later remarried, becoming Mrs Elena M. Bashford.&lt;ref&gt;A list of the sales is found in the Gilbert and Sullivan Journal, v.9, no. 3, September 1966, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt; Rees and [[David Russell Hulme]] worked together to save a number of autograph manuscripts of the composer [[Edward German]].&lt;ref name=SASS&gt;Turnbull, Stephen. "Terence Rees", ''Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Magazine'', Issue 86, Winter 2014/15, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Zoo'' is an 1875 one-act operetta by Arthur Sullivan and [[B. C. Stephenson]], who wrote the [[libretto]] under the pseudonym Bolton Rowe. The score was believed lost until Rees located it in the 1950s in the vault at [[Coutts]] Bank, where several Sullivan manuscripts were stored. The discovery was particularly important, because Herbert Sullivan wrote in 1927 that his uncle re-used the music of ''The Zoo'' in the later operas, but this turned out to be false. After Herbert's widow died, Rees purchased the manuscript at the 1966 auction. He then arranged for a piano/vocal reduction of ''The Zoo'' to be published. Using Rees's materials, the operetta received its first modern production in 1971, was subsequently broadcast by the BBC and was recorded by the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/zoo1978.htm "The 1978 D'Oyly Carte ''Zoo''"], Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 21 September 2008, accessed 19 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Rees also discovered the libretto to [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s 1863 play ''Uncle Baby'' (Gilbert's first produced play), which he published in 1968, and in 1983 he found six of the original 1887 portraits from the original production of ''[[Ruddigore]]'' at the former Normansfield Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Rees (1984), pp. 27–31&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, Rees and Roderick Spencer published a collection of then-rarely heard Sullivan vocal selections, ''Sing With Sullivan''. These included cut numbers from ''[[Iolanthe]]'' and ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' and songs from several of Sullivan's operas with librettists other than Gilbert that were then nearly unknown.&lt;ref name=SASS/&gt; This volume did much to encourage the rehabilitation of these works.&lt;ref name=G&amp;SSoc/&gt;

In 2006, Rees donated to the [[British Library]] his collection of original manuscript scores, including ''The Zoo, The Contrabandista, The Chieftain, Haddon Hall, The Emerald Isle'', Gilbert and [[Frederic Clay]]'s ''[[Princess Toto]]'', and [[Edward German]]'s ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' and ''[[A Princess of Kensington]]'', as well as prompt books for ''Princess Toto'' and ''Haddon Hall'', among 19 volumes of materials.&lt;ref&gt;See the British Library catalogue&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 2014, aged 86.&lt;ref name=SASS/&gt;

'''''The Old Lacemaker''''' (circa 1655) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Nicolaes Maes]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of the [[Mauritshuis]].

The painting shows a woman making [[bobbin lace]] and the [[lace pillow]] she is using is the same in all the paintings Maes made of lacemakers:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1914, who wrote; "71. An Old Lace-Maker. [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm. Suppl.]] 7. An old woman with spectacles, facing the spectator, sits making lace. She wears a black 
jacket with scarlet sleeves. Over her head hangs a basket of eggs. On a dresser at the side is some crockery. " A masterly production but a little darkened by time" (Sm.).

The 1836 sale was at Christie's lot 60, and the buyer was Colemna.&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/explore/images/10631|title=Explore Nicolaes Maes|website=rkd.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 it came on the market again and the museum was able to purchase it with support from VSB Fonds Den Haag, [[Vereniging Rembrandt]], and Vrienden van het Mauritshuis.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;

'''''Sun Voyager''''' ({{lang-is|Sólfar}}) is a sculpture by {{lang|is|[[Jón Gunnar Árnason]]|italic=no}}, located next to the {{lang|is|[[Sæbraut]]|italic=no}} road in {{lang|is|[[Reykjavík]]|italic=no}}, [[Iceland]]. Sun Voyager is described as a dreamboat, or an ode to the sun. The artist intended it to convey the promise of undiscovered territory, a dream of hope, progress and freedom.

==History==
In 1986, the district association of the west part of the city funded a competition for a new outdoor sculpture to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the city of {{lang|is|Reykjavík|italic=no}}. {{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}}’s ''Sun Voyager'' won the competition, and the [[aluminium]] model ({{convert|42.5|x|88|x|36|cm|abbr=on|disp=comma}}) was presented to the city for enlargement. The full-sized Sun Voyager was eventually unveiled on {{lang|is|Sæbraut|italic=no}} on the birthday of the city of {{lang|is|Reykjavík|italic=no}}, August 18, 1990.

The work is constructed of quality [[stainless steel]] and stands on a circle of [[granite]] slabs surrounded by so-called “town-hall concrete”. It was constructed in accordance with {{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}}’s enlarged full-scale drawing of ''Sun Voyager'' and was overseen by {{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}}’s assistant, the artist {{lang|is|[[Kristinn E. Hrafnsson]]|italic=no}}. The engineering of the sculpture was supervised by the technologist, {{lang|is|[[Sigurjón Yngvason]]|italic=no}}, in close cooperation with {{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}} himself, the building itself was carried out by {{lang|is|[[Reynir Hjálmtýsson]]|italic=no}} and his assistant.

== Concept ==
In an interview published in the newspaper {{lang|is|[[Þjóðviljinn]]|italic=yes}} on June 11, 1987, {{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}} describes the genesis of the work as being part of the Scandinavian art project, [[Experimental Environment]], which conducted various artistic experiments in Iceland, [[Denmark]] and other places in the 1980s:

{{quote|In May 1985, a group of artists, members of the Scandinavian art project, Experimental Environment, gathered to take part in the {{lang|fi|Saari-Vala|italic=no}} Environmental Art Action in Bockholm, Finland. There I experienced a sense of the history of the origins of Icelanders, something which is also related in the present exhibition at the Nordic House in {{lang|is|Reykjavík|italic=no}}. &lt;ref&gt;A documentary entitled ''{{lang|is|Sól|italic=unset}} / Sun (Saari-Vala); {{lang|is|Sól Hnífar Skip|italic=unset}} / Sun Knives Ships'', 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; 

I had an uncanny feeling that I had been on this island before, when travelling on my way from [[Mongolia]] to Iceland, hundreds of years ago. 

As you know, there have been speculations that the Icelanders as a race originated in Mongolia. I have discovered the history of their [[settlement of Iceland|migration to Iceland]], which runs as follows: Many centuries ago, a mighty warlord, let’s say it was [[Alexander the Great]], was living in the centre of the known world. He dispatched his bravest and most experienced warriors, along with some women, [[scribe]]s and other followers, on an exploratory expedition to the [[cardinal direction]]s, the north, west, south, and east, in order to discover and conquer new, unknown territories. Those who headed east followed the rising sun until they reached the steppes of Mongolia. There they settled down and lived in comfort. Those scribes who accompanied the warriors were expected to document the expedition for the king. Several centuries later, when the documents written by the scribes eventually came to be examined, the people discovered that they had another fatherland in the west. They therefore decided to gather together their belongings and head back west towards the setting sun. We followed the sun for days and years, walking, riding and sailing. We enriched our experience and our determination grew in strength as our journey progressed, and we recorded everything that we saw and experienced. I remember endless [[pine]] forests, [[mountain]]s and [[waterfall]]s, lakes, islands, rivers and seas before we eventually reached the ocean. We then constructed huge ships and sailed on westwards towards the setting sun.

As a result of this vivid experience of my participation in this expedition while on the island of Bockholm in the [[Finnish archipelago]], I carved a picture of a sun ship into a granite rock by the sea. The sun ship symbolizes the promise of new, undiscovered territory. It is also being exhibited here at the Nordic House, made of aluminium.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with {{lang|is|text=[[Jón Gunnar Árnason]]. [http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=2910524 "Sól, hnífar, skip"], ''Þjóðviljinn''|italic=unset}}, 11 July 1987&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Location==

There has been some dispute about the eventual location of ''Sun Voyager'' on {{lang|is|Sæbraut|italic=no}} in {{lang|is|Reykjavík|italic=no}}. Some people have complained that the ship does not face west, towards the setting sun in accordance with the concept behind it. The original intention had been for ''Sun Voyager'' to be situated in the west part of {{lang|is|Reykjavík|italic=no}}, for obvious reasons. {{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}}’s original idea had been for the ship to be placed on {{lang|is|[[Landakot]]|italic=no}} hill, the prow facing the centre of {{lang|is|Reykjavík|italic=no}} and the [[stern]] to [[Christ the King Cathedral (Reykjavík)|Christ the King Cathedral]] ({{lang-is|Landakotskirkja|links=no}}). Another possibility was that it could be placed by the harbour in the centre of {{lang|is|Reykjavík|italic=no}} on a specially constructed base. The coastline by {{lang|is|[[Ánanaust]]|italic=no}} nonetheless eventually came to be {{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}}’s preferred location for the ship. Unfortunately, changes in the [[town planning]] for {{lang|is|Reykjavík|italic=no}} came to rule out this location. In the end, the final decision was taken (with {{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}}’s consent) that ''Sun Voyager'' should be located on {{lang|is|Sæbraut|italic=no}} on a small headland (which the artist jokingly called {{lang|is|Jónsnes}}: {{lang|is|Jón|italic=no}}’s Peninsula). {{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}} was well aware that when bolted to its platform, ''Sun Voyager'' would be facing north, but felt that that made little difference when it came down to it.

''Sun Voyager'' was built in accordance with the artist’s hand-drawn full-scale plan. Its irregular form with the ever-flowing lines and poetic movement which are a distinctive feature of so many of his works make it seem as if the ship is floating on air. It reaches out into space in such a way that the sea, the sky and the mind of the observer become part of the work as a whole. As a result, ''Sun Voyager'' has the unique quality of being able to carry each and every observer to wherever his/her mind takes him/her. Few of {{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}}’s works have a simple obvious interpretation. As he stated himself, all works of art should convey a message that transcends the work itself. It is the observer who bears the eventual responsibility for interpreting the works in his/her own way, thus becoming a participant in the overall creation of the work. {{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}}’s works frequently make such demands on the observers, giving them the opportunity to discover new truths as a result of their experience.

== Interpretations==	
It is a common misunderstanding that ''Sun Voyager'' is a [[Viking ship]]. It is quite understandable that many tourists think like this when travelling in Iceland, the land of the sagas.

{{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}} was himself very ill with [[leukaemia]] at the time that the full-scale ''Sun Voyager'' came to be constructed, and he died in April 1989, a year before it was placed in its present location. Some people have thus suggested that {{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}} conceived the work during this period, at a time when he might have been preoccupied with death, and argued that ''Sun Voyager'' should be seen as a vessel that transports souls to the realm of death. ''Sun Voyager'' was essentially envisaged as being a dreamboat, an ode to the sun symbolizing light and hope.

== Related works==
{{lang|is|Galdur|italic=yes}} ("Magic") is another outdoor sculpture that {{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}} was asked to design during this period (1988). It was planned to be situated outside the main entrance of the City Hospital in {{lang|is|Fossvogur, Reykjavík|italic=no}}. {{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}} made drawings and a model of the sculpture in a workshop he set up in an unfinished wing of the hospital during the time that he was a patient there. In an interview published in the newspaper {{lang|is|Morgunblaðið|italic=yes}} on December 4, 1988, {{lang|is|Jón Gunnar|italic=no}} said:

'''''The Wrestlers''''' is an [[oil painting]] on [[paperboard|millboard]] by English artist [[William Etty]], painted around 1840 and currently in the [[York Art Gallery]], in [[York]], England. It depicts a [[wrestling]] match between a black man and a white man, both glistening with sweat and under an intense light emphasising their curves and musculature. While little documentation of the painting exists prior to 1947, it is likely that it was painted over a period of three evenings at the [[Figure drawing|life class]] of the [[Royal Academy]].

The Royal Academy had moved to new premises in [[Trafalgar Square]] in 1837, and the studio used by the life class was cramped and hot, a fact thought to account for the sweatiness of the central figures. Etty was best known for his painting of nude or near-nude women in historical and mythological settings but had also painted men involved in various forms of combat.

In the period in which ''The Wrestlers'' was painted, sports were becoming increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical [[Hellenism (neoclassicism)|Hellenistic]] works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to [[Sociology of race and ethnic relations|race relations]]. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and it is not clear whether he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.

Although ''The Wrestlers'' was probably exhibited as part of a major retrospective of Etty's work in 1849, it then went into a private collection and was not publicly exhibited again for almost a century. In 1947 it was put on sale; with little interest from commercial galleries owing to its subject, it was bought for the bargain price of 30&amp;nbsp;[[guinea (British coin)|guineas]] by the York Art Gallery, where it remains. The painting formed a part of major exhibitions in 2002 and 2011–12.

==Background==
[[File:Etty Andromeda.jpg|right|upright|thumb|''Andromeda'' (1830s, [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]]). It fuelled Etty's notoriety for using scenes from literature and mythology as a pretext to paint nude women.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=32}}|alt=topless woman chained to a rock]]
[[William Etty]] (1787–1849), the seventh son of a [[York]] baker and miller,&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{Cite ODNB|id=8925|title=William Etty}}&lt;/ref&gt; had originally been an apprentice printer in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]],{{sfn|Gilchrist|1855|p=23}} but on completing his seven-year apprenticeship in 1805 moved to [[London]] to become an artist.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; In January 1807 he was admitted to the [[Royal Academy|Royal Academy Schools]] as a probationer,{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=20}} and in July of that year became a student of renowned portrait painter [[Thomas Lawrence]],{{sfn|Burnage|2011a|p=157}} studying under him for a year.{{sfn|Burnage|2011a|p=158}}

Strongly influenced by the works of [[Titian]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], Etty became famous for painting [[Nude (art)|&lt;!-- Normally this would be overlinking, but in this context readers are likely to want to learn more about the tradition of nude art --&gt;nude figures]] in biblical, literary and mythological settings.&lt;ref name="MAG Etty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211024806/http://www.manchestergalleries.org/salvaged/the-painting/about-the-artist/index.html|archivedate=11 February 2015|title=About the artist|publisher=Manchester Art Gallery|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became well-respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones.{{sfn|Burnage|2011c|p=198}} Many of his peers greatly admired his work, and in February 1828 he defeated [[John Constable]] by 18 votes to five to become a full [[Royal Academician]],{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=52}} at the time the highest honour available to an artist.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=135}}

Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nude figures.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=32}} While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections in England, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 [[Society for the Suppression of Vice|Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice]].{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=53}}

Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and the prurient reaction of the lower classes to these paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century.{{sfn|Smith|2001b|p=55}} Although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received,{{efn-ua|Etty's male nude portraits were primarily of mythological heroes and classical combat, genres in which the depiction of male nudity was considered acceptable in England.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|pp=32–33}}}} many critics condemned his recurrent depictions of female nudity as indecent.{{sfn|Burnage|2011d|p=32}}&lt;ref name="MAG Etty" /&gt;

==Composition==
{{Quote box|width=34em|align=right|salign=right|quote=In my time, as a Student, I have known him set three or four models together. Now, it was a group of Graces; now, a composition of two or three Gladiators. Sometimes, a dark man or tawny female was introduced, for picturesque contrast with a fair form of the same sex.|source=[[Daniel Maclise|Maclise]] on Etty's arrangement of models at the Royal Academy life class{{sfn|Gilchrist|1855|p=58}}}}
''The Wrestlers'' is an [[oil study]] from life, depicting a black and a white wrestler [[grappling]].{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=75}} Although at first glance the white wrestler appears to be dominant, the figures are in fact equally matched;{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}}{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=84}} this was unusual for the time, as it was a common belief in Britain in this period that black people were physically weaker than whites.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}} Showing the subjects under bright light, the painting is a combination of intense juxtapositions between intimacy and violence, dark and light skin, and hard and soft surfaces.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=75}} The black wrestler is naked; the white wrestler wears a [[loincloth]], although it is possible that this was added after Etty's death.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}} The intense light casts deep shadows, emphasising the curves and musculature of the wrestlers' bodies,{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=78}} as the skin of the two combatants is stretched and distorted under the pressure of the grapple.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=77}} The figures are set against a dark green curtain and a brown wall, rather than in a wrestling ring.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=79}}

The identity of the wrestlers is not known. Alison Smith, Lead Curator of British Art to 1900 at [[Tate]], speculates that the white figure may have been John Wilton of Somerset, who had possibly been the model for [[Little John]] in [[Daniel Maclise]]'s 1839 ''Robin Hood and His Merry Men Entertaining Richard the Lionheart in Sherwood Forest''.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}}{{efn-ua|"A Working Artist", writing anonymously in ''[[The Art Journal|The Art-Union]]'' in 1841, described Wilton as "a '[[Somerset|Zummurzetshire]] man' but with such a head, face, and beard, as would have rejoiced Salvator. This gentleman has for some years cultivated his mustachios and his vegetables at the same time, of both of which he has a prolific crop."&lt;ref name=LM&gt;{{cite journal|last="A Working Artist"|date=1 Sep 1841|title=Living Models|journal=The Art-Union|publisher=How and Parsons|location=London|volume=3|issue=32|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The figures glisten with sweat. Art historian Sarah Victoria Turner speculates that this is not simply for dramatic effect, but reflects the fact that after the Royal Academy's 1837 move to its new building in [[Trafalgar Square]] the studio used by the life class was a cramped and poorly ventilated room lit by [[gas lighting|gaslight]], which when crowded with students and with the lights on could become extremely hot.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=79}}

[[File:William Etty at the Life Class by William Holman Hunt YORAG R3257-1 crop.jpg|right|thumb|''William Etty at the Life Class'', [[William Holman Hunt]] (1840–1850, [[York Art Gallery]])|alt=balding man sketching a naked figure]]
''The Wrestlers'' is thought to have been painted in around 1840.{{sfn|Farr|1958|p=163}} It is likely that it was executed at the Royal Academy's [[life class]]; despite his senior status, Etty continued to attend there throughout his life. While students at the class usually worked from a single model, Etty would occasionally arrange for "a Treat", in which a group of models would be used to create an entire composition for the students to sketch (often arranged in poses derived from [[Old Master]] paintings).{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=25}} Painted on [[paperboard|millboard]], ''The Wrestlers'' was probably executed over the course of three evenings. On the first evening Etty would have drawn the models in [[chalk]] or [[charcoal]] and inked the outline; on the second evening the figures would have been painted in [[oil paint]], and on the third evening a thin [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]] would have been applied to the painting to which colour would then have been added.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=77}}{{efn-ua|As no records survive of the painting of ''The Wrestlers'' it is not certain how Etty worked, but it is well-documented that this three-day process was his usual method of working.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=77}}}}

===Subject===
Although best known for his paintings of women, Etty had also produced paintings of nude or semi-nude men engaged in combat, such as 1829's ''Benaiah''. There was a tendency among British artists in this period to attempt to illustrate the physiques of strong and well-proportioned living men, as an indication that the best of British manhood had reached or surpassed the [[Hellenism (neoclassicism)|Hellenistic ideal]] which at that time was considered the model of perfection.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}} Almost all artists, as part of their training, would be expected to draw from reproductions of classical statues in British museums, or to visit Italy and Greece to view the originals ''in situ''.{{sfn|Turner|2011|pp=80–81}} Etty, and other British artists of the day, would have been familiar with the technical issues of drawing men wrestling, as the ''[[Wrestlers (sculpture)|Uffizi Wrestlers]]'' (the ''Pancrastinae'') was one of the subjects new entrants to the Royal Academy Schools were required to draw.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}}{{efn-ua|An early drawing of the ''Uffizi Wrestlers'' survives in one of Etty's sketchbooks.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=81}}}} Etty had  also  made lengthy visits to France and Italy in 1816, 1822–24 and 1830 to view and sketch the paintings and statuary of those countries, with additional visits to Belgium in 1840 and 1841 to view the works of [[Rubens]], whom he greatly admired.{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|pp=21–26}} 
 
[[File:Benaiah by William Etty YORAG 70.JPG|right|thumb|''Benaiah'' (1829, [[York Art Gallery]])|alt=one semi-naked man preparing to stab another]]
Moreover, as the [[industrial revolution]] took hold and the prevalence of manual labour declined, there were increasing concerns that British men would become unfit and undisciplined; images of sport and combat were thought to motivate the viewer to aspire to an ideal of physical strength which people were worried was becoming lost.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=80}} Wrestling and boxing thus were popular subjects for artworks, and Etty had produced other paintings and sketches of men engaged in fights of one kind or another.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=80}}{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=76}} It had become common for artists to use boxers and soldiers as models, as they had the strength and bearing considered desirable, and the discipline to hold a pose for long periods in the studio.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}}

The motivation behind Etty's choice to pair a black and a white wrestler is not clear. Etty had painted black and [[Indian people|Indian]] subjects in the past,{{efn-ua|Etty's first critically successful painting, ''[[The Triumph of Cleopatra]]'', included black figures; he also painted portraits of black and Indian models.{{sfn|Turner|2011|pp=78–79}}}} and it was not unusual in that period for artists to use non-white models, but it was rare to show a black and a white figure embracing. It is possible that he was simply interested in the contrast between the flesh tones;{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=87}} it is documented that he would sometimes arrange models of different skin colours for that reason.{{sfn|Gilchrist|1855|p=58}} It is also possible that he saw "primitive" black men as closer in spirit or physique to the wrestlers of the classical civilisations.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=87}} Sarah Victoria Turner argues that combat was the only subject in which it would have been felt appropriate at the time to depict naked black and white figures in intimate closeness.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=78}}

1840, the year in which ''The Wrestlers'' is likely to have been painted, saw the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in London and the London exhibition of ''[[The Slave Ship]]'' and ''[[:commons:File:The Slave Trade by Auguste Francois Biard.jpg|The Slave Trade]]'', and race relations had become a major social and political issue.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=78}} While black wrestlers and boxers—often former slaves from the United States or their descendants—were not unusual in England in the period,{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=85}} and the former slave [[Tom Molineaux]] had twice challenged for the boxing world championship in 1811, they were still treated with suspicion by many members of the public.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=86}}

==Sale and exhibition==

Virtually no contemporary records or reviews of ''The Wrestlers'' exist,{{sfn|Turner|2011|pp=75–76}} and it was probably sold to a private collector either on its completion or in the sale of over 800 works found in Etty's studio following his death;{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}}{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=80}} Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty lists the painting exhibited in 1849 as "lent by C.

Wass was a noted [[engraver]] who published engravings of some of Etty's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 December 1849|title=Mr. William Etty, R.A.|journal=The Penny Illustrated News|publisher=William Strange|location=London|volume=1|issue=6|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} ''The Wrestlers'' was probably exhibited at the June 1849 [[Royal Society of Arts]] retrospective of over 130 works by Etty, shortly before his death on 13 November of that year.{{sfn|Burnage|Bertram|2011|p=27}} (Etty produced three paintings entitled ''The Wrestlers'', and it is not certain which was the one exhibited in 1849,{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}} although it is thought likely to be this one.{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=80}})

Etty died in 1849, and his work enjoyed a brief boom in popularity.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=440}} Interest in him declined over time, and by the end of the 19th century the value of all his paintings had fallen below their original levels.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=440}} Following his death, nude paintings went out of fashion very rapidly in Britain.{{sfn|Smith|1996|p=2}}

{{Quotation|An old man, semi-nude, is stepping forward while another man, seen from the back and of dark complexion, embraces his legs.

''The Wrestlers'' was sold by a private collector on 31 October 1947. Owing to its subject matter there was little interest from commercial galleries, and it was bought by [[York Civic Trust]] for the bargain price of 30&amp;nbsp;[[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (£31.50; about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|31.5|1957|r=-1}}|0}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}).{{sfn|Turner|2011|p=75}} It was immediately presented to the [[York Art Gallery]], where it remains.{{sfn|Smith|2001a|p=61}} The painting was one of five works by Etty exhibited in [[Tate Britain]]'s 2002 exhibition ''Exposed: The Victorian Nude'', and was a central component of a major retrospective of Etty's work at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12.{{sfn|Burnage|2011b|p=131}}

[[Image:Christus Sol Invictus.jpeg|thumb|Detail of the mosaic]]
The popularly named '''"Tomb of the Julii"''' (Mausoleum "M") survives in the [[Vatican Necropolis]] beneath [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. The serendipitous discovery near the [[crypt]] has a vaulted ceiling bearing a [[mosaic]] depicting [[Helios]] (Roman [[Sol Invictus]]) with an [[aureole]] riding in his chariot, within a framing of rinceaux of vine leaves, which are not given their usual pagan [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] reading in this context but are related to the True Vine imagery of [[Gospel of John]] 15.1. The mosaic is dated to the late 3rd century to early 4th century.  Other mosaics in this tomb depicting Jonah and the whale, the good shepherd carrying a lamb (the ''[[kriophoros]]'' motif), and fishermen have encouraged its interpretation as a Christian tomb.

This tomb was first discovered in 1574 AD when workmen accidentally broke through the ceiling while conducting some floor alterations in the basilica. The inside was briefly explored and documented before the opening was sealed over once more.&lt;ref&gt;The Bones of Saint Peter, John Evangelist Walsh 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''trademark''', '''trade mark''', or '''trade-mark'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;The styling of ''trademark'' as a single word is predominantly used in the United States and Philippines only, while the two-word styling ''trade mark'' is used in many other countries around the world, including the European Union and Commonwealth and ex-Commonwealth jurisdictions (although Canada officially uses "trade-mark" pursuant to the ''Trade-mark Act'', "trade mark" and "trademark" are also commonly used).&lt;/ref&gt; is a recognizable [[sign (semiotics)|sign]], [[design]], or [[expression (language)|expression]] which identifies [[Good (economics and accounting)|products]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] of a particular source from those of others,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/definitions.jsp |title= A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol, and/or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others.|accessdate=2011-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-about/t-whatis.htm |title= A trade mark is a sign which can distinguish your goods and services from those of your competitors (you may refer to your trade mark as your "brand").|accessdate=2012-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; although trademarks used to identify services are usually called [[service mark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.patentamt.de/english/trade_marks/index.html |title= Trade marks identify the goods and services of particular traders.

A trademark may be located on a [[Packaging and labeling|package]], a [[label]], a [[voucher]], or on the product itself. For the sake of [[corporate identity]], trademarks are often displayed on company buildings.

The first legislative act concerning trademarks was passed in 1266 under the reign of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], requiring all bakers to use a distinctive mark for the bread they sold.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The first modern trademark laws emerged in the late 19th century. In France the first comprehensive trademark system in the world was passed into law in 1857. The [[Trade Marks Act 1938]] of the United Kingdom changed the system, permitting registration based on "intent-to-use”, creating an examination based process, and creating an application publication system. The 1938 Act, which served as a model for similar legislation elsewhere, contained other novel concepts such as "associated trademarks", a consent to use system, a defensive mark system, and non claiming right system.

==Usage==
[[File:Counterfeit weights.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Gym weights displaying a counterfeit trademark]]

A trademark identifies the [[brand]] owner of a particular product or service&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thepolarislawfirm.com/trademark/|title=Everything You Need to Know About Trademark Law {{!}} The Polaris Law Firm|work=The Polaris Law Firm|access-date=2018-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Trademarks can be used by others under licensing agreements; for example, [[Bullyland]] obtained a license to produce [[The Smurfs (merchandising)|Smurf]] figurines; [[the Lego Group]] purchased a license from [[Lucasfilm]] in order to be allowed to launch [[Lego Star Wars]]; [[TT Toys Toys]] is a manufacturer of licensed ride-on replica cars for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.toystoys.it/en |title= TT Toys Toys is the only company in the world that can boast a vast catalogue of models developed under license of the most important car manufacturers (Ferrari, BMW, Mercedes, Porsche, Maserati, Citroen, Peugeot, Renault, etc.) |accessdate= 2013-01-02 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130218122050/http://www.toystoys.it/en |archivedate= 18 February 2013 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The unauthorized usage of trademarks by producing and trading [[counterfeit consumer goods]] is known as [[brand piracy]].

The owner of a trademark may pursue [[lawsuit|legal action]] against [[trademark infringement]]. Most countries require formal registration of a trademark as a precondition for pursuing this type of action. The United States, Canada and other countries also recognize common law trademark rights, which means action can be taken to protect an unregistered trademark if it is in use. Still, common law trademarks offer the holder, in general, less legal protection than registered trademarks.

==Designation==
A trademark may be designated by the following symbols:
*'''[[trademark symbol|™]]''' (the "[[trademark symbol]]", which is the letters "TM"  in superscript, for an [[unregistered trademark]], a mark used to promote or brand goods)
*'''[[service mark symbol|℠]]''' (which is the letters "SM" in superscript, for an unregistered [[service mark]], a mark used to promote or brand services)
*'''[[®]]''' (the letter "R" surrounded by a circle, for a registered trademark)
==Styles==
A trademark is typically a name, word, phrase, [[logo]], [[symbol]], [[design]], image, or a combination of these elements.&lt;ref name="Restatement 1995"&gt;Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 9 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a range of [[non-conventional trademark]]s comprising marks which do not fall into these standard categories, such as those based on colour, smell, or sound (like [[jingle]]s). Trademarks which are considered offensive are often rejected according to a nation's trademark law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.enquirer.com/editions/1997/06/25/bus_nike.html |title= In addition to recalling 38,000 pairs of the offensive shoes, Nike has diverted another 30,000 pairs from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Indonesia and Turkey to "less-sensitive" markets |accessdate=1997-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''trademark'' is also used informally to refer to any distinguishing attribute by which an individual is readily identified, such as the well-known characteristics of celebrities. When a trademark is used in relation to services rather than products, it may sometimes be called a [[service mark]], particularly in the [[United States trademark law|United States]].&lt;ref name="Restatement 1995"/&gt;

==Fundamental concepts==
The essential function of a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial source or origin of products or services, so a trademark, properly called, ''indicates source'' or serves as a ''badge of origin''. In other words, trademarks serve to identify a particular business as the source of goods or services. The use of a trademark in this way is known as ''trademark use''. Certain [[exclusive right]]s attach to a registered mark.

Trademark rights generally arise out of the use of, or to maintain exclusive rights over, that sign in relation to certain products or services, assuming there are no other trademark objections.

Different goods and services have been classified by the [[International (Nice) Classification of Goods and Services]] into 45 [[Trademark Classes]] (1 to 34 cover goods, and 35 to 45 cover services). The idea behind this system is to specify and limit the extension of the intellectual property right by determining which goods or services are covered by the mark, and to unify classification systems around the world.

==History==
In trademark treatises it is usually reported that [[blacksmiths]] who made [[sword]]s in the [[Roman Empire]] are thought of as being the first users of trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gary |last=Richardson |title=Brand Names Before the Industrial Revolution |work=NBER Working Paper No. 13930 |date=April 2008 |doi=10.3386/w13930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable trademarks that have been used for a long time include [[Löwenbräu]], which claims use of its lion mark since 1383.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Packard |first=Ashley |authorlink= |title=Digital Media Law |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |location= |page=162 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YcYJGlKJ4g4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=9781444318203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first trademark legislation was passed by the [[Parliament of England]] under the reign of King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] in 1266, which required all bakers to use a distinctive mark for the bread they sold.&lt;ref name="tmprotect"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tmprotect.idknet.com/eng/history.html|title=History of Trademarks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first modern trademark laws emerged in the late 19th century. In France the first comprehensive trademark system in the world was passed into law in 1857 with the "Manufacture and Goods Mark Act". In Britain, the [[Merchandise Marks Act 1862]] made it a criminal offence to imitate another's trade mark 'with intent to defraud or to enable another to defraud'. In 1875, the [[Trade Marks Registration Act 1875|Trade Marks Registration Act]] was passed which allowed formal registration of trade marks at the UK Patent Office for the first time. Registration was considered to comprise ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence of ownership of a trade mark and registration of marks began on 1 January 1876. The 1875 Act defined a registrable trade mark as 'a device, or mark, or name of an individual or firm printed in some particular and distinctive manner; or a written signature or copy of a written signature of an individual or firm; or a distinctive label or ticket'.&lt;ref name="bently 2008"&gt;Bently, Lionel, "The Making of Modern Trade Marks Law: The Construction of the Legal Concept of Trade Mark (1860-80)" in Lionel Bently, Jane C. Ginsburg &amp; Jennifer Davis (eds), ''Trade Marks and Brands: An Interdisciplinary Critique'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], [[United States Congress|Congress]] first attempted to establish a federal trademark regime in 1870. This statute purported to be an exercise of Congress' [[Copyright Clause]] powers. However, the Supreme Court struck down the 1870 statute in the ''[[Trade-Mark Cases]]'' later on in the decade. In 1881, Congress passed a new trademark act, this time pursuant to its [[Commerce Clause]] powers. Congress revised the Trademark Act in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.iip.or.jp/translation/ono/ch2.pdf|title=The History and Development of Trademark Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Lanham Act]] of 1946 updated the law and has served, with several amendments, as the primary federal law on trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;Roger W. Dyer Jr., [http://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/mlr/vol77/iss1/10 Monetary Damages under the Lanham Act: Eighth Circuit Holds Actual Confusion is Not a Prerequisite], 77 Mo. L. Rev. (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trade Marks Act 1938]] in the [[United Kingdom]] set up the first registration system based on the “intent-to-use” principle. The Act also established an application publishing procedure and expanded the rights of the trademark holder to include the barring of trademark use even in cases where confusion remained unlikely. This Act served as a model for similar legislation elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9041109382|title=Introduction to Intellectual Property: Theory and Practice|author=World Intellectual Property Organization|year=1997|publisher=Kluwer Law International|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
The two symbols associated with trademarks, ™ (the [[trademark symbol]]) and ® (the [[registered trademark symbol]]), represent the status of a mark and accordingly its level of protection. While ™ can be used with any common law usage of a mark, ® may only be used by the owner of a mark following registration with the relevant national authority, such as the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO or PTO). The proper manner to display either symbol is immediately following the mark in superscript style.

==Terminology==
[[File:Burberry pattern.svg|thumb|right|Approximate drawing of [[Burberry]] check pattern. The pattern is a registered trademark of Burberry Ltd.]]

Terms such as "mark", "[[brand]]" and "[[logo]]" are sometimes used interchangeably with "trademark". "Trademark", however, also includes any device, brand, label, name, signature, word, letter, numerical, shape of goods, packaging, colour or combination of colours, smell, sound, movement or any combination thereof which is capable of distinguishing goods and services of one business from those of others. It must be capable of graphical representation and must be applied to goods or services for which it is registered.

Specialized types of trademark include [[certification mark]]s, [[collective trademark]]s and [[defensive trademark]]s. A trademark which is popularly used to describe a product or service (rather than to distinguish the product or services from those of third parties) is sometimes known as a [[genericized trademark]]. If such a mark becomes [[synonym]]ous with that product or service to the extent that the trademark owner can no longer enforce its proprietary rights, the mark becomes generic.

A "[[trademark look]]" is an informal term for a characteristic look for a performer or character of some sort. It is usually not legally trademark protected and the term is not used in the trademark law.

==Registration==
The law considers a trademark to be a form of [[property]]. [[Wikt:proprietary|Proprietary]] [[rights]] in relation to a trademark may be established through actual use in the [[marketplace]], or through registration of the mark with the trademarks office (or "trademarks registry") of a particular [[jurisdiction]]. In some jurisdictions, trademark rights can be established through either or both means. Certain jurisdictions generally do not recognize trademarks rights arising through use. If trademark owners do not hold registrations for their marks in such jurisdictions, the extent to which they will be able to enforce their rights through [[trademark infringement]] proceedings will therefore be limited. In cases of dispute, this disparity of rights is often referred to as "first to file" as opposed to "first to use." Other countries such as Germany offer a limited amount of common law rights for unregistered marks where to gain protection, the goods or services must occupy a highly significant position in the marketplace&amp;nbsp;— where this could be 40% or more market share for sales in the particular class of goods or services.

In the United States, the registration process includes several steps. First, the trademark owner files an application to register the trademark. About three months after it is filed, the application is reviewed by an examining attorney at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The examining attorney checks for compliance with the rules of the Trademark Manual of Examination Procedure.&lt;ref name="TMEP Sec. 700"&gt;[http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/0700.htm TMEP Sec. 700] Trademark Manual.&lt;/ref&gt; This review includes procedural matters such as making sure the applicant's goods or services are identified properly. It also includes more substantive matters such as making sure the applicant's mark is not merely descriptive or likely to cause confusion with a pre-existing applied-for or registered mark.&lt;ref name="TMEP Sec. 1200"&gt;[http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/1200.htm TMEP Sec. 1200], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; If the application runs afoul of any requirement, the examining attorney will issue an office action requiring the applicant to address certain issues or refusals prior to registration of the mark. If the examining attorney approves the application, it will be "published for opposition." During this 30-day period third parties who may be affected by the registration of the trademark may step forward to file an Opposition Proceeding to stop the registration of the mark. If an Opposition proceeding is filed it institutes a case before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to determine both the validity of the grounds for the opposition as well as the ability of the applicant to register the mark at issue.&lt;ref name="TBMP Sec. 300 et seq."&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/process/appeal/tbmp_ed2_rev1.pdf TBMP Sec. 300 et seq.], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, provided that no third-party opposes the registration of the mark during the opposition period or the opposition is ultimately decided in the applicant's favor the mark will be registered in due course.

Outside of the United States the registration process is substantially similar to that found in the U.S. save for one notable exception in many countries: registration occurs prior to the opposition proceeding. In short, once an application is reviewed by an examiner and found to be entitled to registration a registration certificate is issued subject to the mark being open to opposition for a period of typically 6 months from the date of registration.

A registered trademark confers a [[bundle of rights|bundle]] of [[exclusive right]]s upon the registered owner, including the right to exclusive use of the mark in relation to the products or services for which it is registered. The law in most jurisdictions also allows the owner of a registered trademark to prevent unauthorized use of the mark in relation to products or services which are identical or "colourfully" similar to the "registered" products or services, and in certain cases, prevent use in relation to entirely dissimilar products or services. The test is always whether a consumer of the goods or services will be confused as to the identity of the source or origin. An example may be a very large multinational brand such as "Sony" where a non-electronic product such as a pair of sunglasses might be assumed to have come from Sony Corporation of Japan despite not being a class of goods that Sony has rights in.

Once trademark rights are established in a particular jurisdiction, these rights are generally only enforceable in that jurisdiction, a quality which is sometimes known as '''territoriality'''. However, there is a range of international trademark laws and systems which facilitate the protection of trademarks in more than one jurisdiction.

==Search==
In the United States the USPTO maintains a database of registered trademarks. The database is open to the public. A licensed attorney may be required to interpret the search results. As trademarks are governed by federal law, state law, and common law, a thorough search as to the availability of a mark is very important. In the United States obtaining a trademark search and relying upon the results of an opinion issued by an attorney may insulate a trademark user from being required to pay treble damages and attorney's fees in a trademark infringement case as it demonstrates that the trademark user performed [[due diligence]] and was using the mark in good faith. The USPTO internally captures more information about trademarks than what they publicly disclose on their official search website, such as the complete contents of every logo trademark filing.

Trademarks may also be searched on third-party databases such as [[LexisNexis]], [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]], and [[CompuMark]].

Within the European Union, searches have to be conducted taking into account both EU Trademarks as well as national trademarks.

Classification systems exist to help in searching for marks. One example is the "International Classification of the Figurative Elements of Marks", better known as the Vienna Classification.

==Ability to register== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Australian trade mark law]] --&gt;
In most systems, a trademark can be registered if it is able to [[Trademark distinctiveness|distinguish the goods or services]] of a party, will not confuse consumers about the relationship between one party and another, and will not otherwise deceive consumers with respect to the qualities.

===Distinctive character===
{{Main article|Trademark distinctiveness}}
A trademark may be eligible for registration, or registerable, if it performs the essential trademark function, and has distinctive character. Registerability can be understood as a continuum, with "inherently distinctive" marks at one end, "generic" and "descriptive" marks with no distinctive character at the other end, and "suggestive" and "arbitrary" marks lying between these two points. "Descriptive" marks must acquire distinctiveness through secondary meaning – [[consumers]] have come to recognize the mark as a source indicator – to be protectable. "Generic" terms are used to refer to the product or service itself and cannot be used as trademarks. (See the KitKat v Cadbury case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/16/kit-kat-unprotected-european-court-rejects-trademark-case|title=KitKat goes unprotected as European court rejects trademark case|first=Sean|last=Farrell|date=16 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Maintaining rights==

Trademarks rights must be maintained through actual lawful use of the trademark. These rights will cease if a mark is not actively used for a period of time, normally 5 years in most jurisdictions. In the case of a trademark registration, failure to actively use the mark in the lawful course of trade, or to enforce the registration in the event of infringement, may also expose the registration itself to become liable for an application for the removal from the register after a certain period of time on the grounds of "non-use".

It is not necessary for a trademark owner to take enforcement action against all infringement if it can be shown that the owner perceived the infringement to be minor and inconsequential. This is designed to prevent owners from continually being tied up in litigation for fear of cancellation. An owner can at any time commence action for infringement against a third party as long as it had not previously notified the third party of its discontent following third party use and then failed to take action within a reasonable period of time (called acquiescence). The owner can always reserve the right to take legal action until a court decides that the third party had gained notoriety which the owner 'must' have been aware of. It will be for the third party to prove their use of the mark is substantial as it is the onus of a company using a mark to check they are not infringing previously registered rights. In the US, owing to the overwhelming number of unregistered rights, trademark applicants are advised to perform searches not just of the trademark register but of local business directories and relevant trade press. Specialized search companies perform such tasks prior to application.

All jurisdictions with a mature trademark registration system provide a mechanism for removal in the event of such ''non use'', which is usually a period of either three or five years. The intention to use a trademark can be proven by a wide range of acts as shown in the "Wooly Bull" and ''[[Aston v Harlee]]'' cases.

In the U.S., failure to use a trademark for this period of time will result in ''abandonment'' of the mark, whereby any party may use the mark. An abandoned mark is not irrevocably in the [[public domain]], but may instead be re-registered by any party&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which has re-established exclusive and active use, and must be associated or linked with the original mark owner. A mark is registered in conjunction with a description of a specific type of goods, and if the party uses the mark but in conjunction with a different type of goods, the mark may still be considered abandoned, as was the case in [[Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc.]]. If a court rules that a trademark has become  "[[Generic trademark|generic]]" through common use (such that the mark no longer performs the essential trademark function and the average consumer no longer considers that exclusive rights attach to it), the corresponding registration may also be ruled invalid.

Unlike other forms of intellectual property (e.g., patents and copyrights) a registered trademark can, theoretically, last forever.  So long as a trademark's use is continuous a trademark holder may keep the mark registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by filing Section 8 Affidavit(s) of Continuous Use as well as Section 9 Applications for renewal, as required.

Specifically, once registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office the owner of a trademark is required to file a Section 8 Affidavit of Continuous Use to maintain the registration between the 5th and 6th year anniversaries of the registration of the mark or during the 6-month grace period following the 6th anniversary of the registration.&lt;ref name="TMEP Sec. 1604.04"&gt;[http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/1600.htm#_T160404 TMEP Sec. 1604.04], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, a trademark owner may concurrently opt to file a Section 15, Declaration of Incontestability. A mark declared incontestable is immune from future challenge, except in instances where the mark becomes generic, the mark is abandoned, or if the registration was acquired fraudulently. Note, if the Section 8 Affidavit is filed during the 6-month grace period additional fees to file the Affidavit with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will apply.&lt;ref name="TMEP USPTO Fee Schedule"&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/qs/ope/fee2009september15.htm#tm USPTO Fee Schedule], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to requirement above, U.S. trademark registrations are also required to be renewed on or about every 10-year anniversary of the registration of the trademark.  The procedure for 10-year renewals is somewhat different from that for the 5th-6th year renewal.  In brief, registrants are required to file both a Section 8 Affidavit of Continuous Use as well as a Section 9 Application for Renewal every ten years to maintain their registration.&lt;ref name="TMEP Sec. 1606 et seq."&gt;[http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/1600.htm#_T1606 TMEP Sec. 1606 et seq.], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcing rights==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}
The extent to which a trademark owner may prevent unauthorized use of trademarks which are the same as or similar to its trademark depends on various factors such as whether its trademark is registered, the similarity of the trademarks involved, the similarity of the products or services involved, and whether the owner's trademark is ''well known'' or, under U.S. law relating to [[trademark dilution]], ''famous''.

If a trademark has not been registered, some jurisdictions (especially [[Common Law]] countries) offer protection for the [[business]] [[reputation]] or [[goodwill (business)|goodwill]] which attaches to unregistered trademarks through the [[tort]] of [[passing off (legal term)|passing off]]. Passing off may provide a remedy in a scenario where a business has been trading under an unregistered trademark for many years, and a rival business starts using the same or a similar mark.

If a trademark has been registered, then it is much easier for the trademark owner to demonstrate its trademark rights and to enforce these rights through an infringement action&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thepolarislawfirm.com/trademark/|title=Everything You Need to Know About Trademark Law {{!}} The Polaris Law Firm|work=The Polaris Law Firm|access-date=2018-07-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Unauthorized use of a registered trademark need not be intentional in order for infringement to occur, although damages in an infringement [[lawsuit]] will generally be greater if there was an intention to deceive.

For trademarks which are considered to be well known, infringing use may occur where the use occurs in relation to products or services which are not the same as or similar to the products or services in relation to which the owner's mark is registered.
A growing area of law relating to the enforcement of trademark rights is [[secondary liability]], which allows for the imputation of liability to one who has not acted directly to infringe a trademark but whose legal responsibility may arise under the doctrines of either contributory or vicarious liability.&lt;ref&gt;See Jane Coleman, [http://www.secondarytrademarkinfringement.com/?p=95  ''Secondary Trademark Infringement: A Short Treatise on Contributory and Vicarious Infringement in Trademark''] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120913081422/http://www.secondarytrademarkinfringement.com/?p=95 |date=13 September 2012 }} (Revised, Sept. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limits and defenses to claims of infringement===
Trademark is subject to various defenses, such as abandonment, [[Tea Rose-Rectanus doctrine|limitations on geographic scope]], and fair use. In the United States, the [[fair use (U.S. trademark law)|fair use]] defence protects many of the interests in free expression related to those protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

[[File:LinuxWasch3.jpg|thumb|A product bearing "Linux" name, but not infringing [[Linux Mark Institute|the trademark owned by Linus Torvalds]], because it falls into a different category]]
Fair use may be asserted on two grounds, either that the alleged infringer is using the mark to describe accurately an aspect of its products, or that the alleged infringer is using the mark to identify the mark owner.  One of the most visible proofs that trademarks provide a limited right in the U.S. comes from the comparative advertising that is seen throughout U.S. media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2008/11/16/comparative-advertising-mac-vs-pc/ Comparative Advertising: Mac vs. PC] - "In the United States where we hold the First Amendment above reproach by any laws, there are many legitimate and legal uses of a trademark, and the right to engage in comparative advertising is among one of those legitimate uses."&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the first type is that although [[Maytag]] owns the trademark "Whisper Quiet" for its dishwashers, makers of other products may describe their goods as being "whisper quiet" so long as these products do not fall under the same category of goods the trademark is protected under.

An example of the second type is that [[Audi]] can run advertisements saying that a trade publication has rated an Audi model higher than a [[BMW]] model, since they are only using "BMW" to identify the competitor. In a related sense, an auto mechanic can truthfully advertise that he services [[Volkswagen]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Church'', 411 F.2d 350, 352 (9th Cir. 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; and a former ''[[Playboy]]'' [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate of the Year]] can identify herself as such on her website.&lt;ref&gt;''Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Welles'', 279 F.3d 796 (9th Cir. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrongful or groundless threats of infringement===
Various jurisdictions have laws which are designed to prevent trademark owners from making wrongful threats of trademark infringement action against other parties.  These laws are intended to prevent large or powerful companies from intimidating or harassing smaller companies.

Where one party makes a threat to sue another for trademark infringement, but does not have a genuine basis or intention to carry out that threat, or does not carry out the threat at all within a certain period, the threat may itself become a basis for legal action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/ukpga_19940026_en_2#pt1-pb4-l1g21 Section 21, Trade Marks Act 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this situation, the party receiving such a threat may seek from the Court a [[declaratory judgment]]; also known as a declaratory ruling.

==Other aspects==

===Public policy===
Trademark law is designed to fulfill the [[public policy]] objective of [[consumer protection]], by preventing the public from being misled as to the origin or quality of a product or service. By identifying the commercial source of products and services, trademarks facilitate identification of products and services which meet the expectations of consumers as to quality and other characteristics.

Trademarks may also serve as an incentive for manufacturers, providers or suppliers to consistently provide quality products or services to maintain their business reputation. Furthermore, if a trademark owner does not maintain [[quality control]] and adequate supervision in relation to the manufacture and provision of products or services supplied by a licensee, such "naked licensing" will eventually adversely affect the owner's rights in the trademark. For US law ''see, ex.'' ''Eva's Bridal Ltd. v. Halanick Enterprises, Inc.'' 639 F.3d 788 (7th Cir. 2011). This proposition has, however, been watered down by the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of ''Scandecor Development AB v. Scandecor Marketing AB et al.'' [2001] UKHL 21; wherein it has been held that the mere fact that a bare license (equivalent of the United States concept of a naked license) has been granted did not automatically mean that a trademark was liable to mislead.

By the same token, trademark holders must be cautious in the sale of their mark for similar reasons as apply to licensing.  When assigning an interest in a trademark, if the associated product or service is not transferred with it, then this may be an "assignment-in-gross" and could lead to a loss of rights in the trademark. It is still possible to make significant changes to the underlying goods or services during a sale without jeopardizing the trademark, but companies will often contract with the sellers to help transition the mark and goods or services to the new owners to ensure continuity of the trademark.

===Comparison with patents, designs and copyright===
{{See also|Functionality doctrine|Threshold of originality}}
While trademark law seeks to protect indications of the commercial source of products or services, [[patent]] law generally seeks to protect new and useful inventions, and registered designs law generally seeks to protect the look or appearance of a manufactured article. Trademarks, patents and designs collectively form a subset of intellectual property known as industrial property because they are often created and used in an industrial or commercial context.

By comparison, [[copyright]] law generally seeks to protect original literary, artistic and other creative works. Continued active use and re-registration can make a trademark perpetual, whereas copyright usually lasts for the duration of the author's lifespan plus 70 years for works by individuals, and some limited time after creation for works by bodies corporate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Directive harmonizing the term of copyright protection]]&lt;/ref&gt; This can lead to confusion in cases where a work passes into the [[public domain]] but the character in question remains a registered trademark.

Although intellectual property laws such as these are theoretically distinct, more than one type may afford protection to the same article. For example, the particular design of a bottle may qualify for copyright protection as a non-utilitarian [sculpture], or for trademark protection based on its shape, or the '[[trade dress]]' appearance of the bottle as a whole may be protectable. Titles and character names from books or movies may also be protectable as trademarks while the works from which they are drawn may qualify for copyright protection as a whole. Trademark protection does not apply to utilitarian features of a product such as the plastic interlocking studs on Lego bricks.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite CanLII|litigants=Kirkbi AG v. Ritvik Holdings Inc.|link=Kirkbi AG v. Ritvik Holdings Inc.|year=2005|court=scc|num=65|format=scc|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing these distinctions is necessary, but often challenging for the courts and lawyers, especially in jurisdictions where patents and copyrights pass into the [[public domain]], depending on the jurisdiction. Unlike patents and copyrights, which in theory are granted for one-off fixed terms, trademarks remain valid as long as the owner actively uses and defends them and maintains their registrations with the competent authorities. This often involves payment of a periodic renewal fee.

As a trademark must be used to maintain rights in relation to that mark, a trademark can be 'abandoned' or its registration can be cancelled or revoked if the mark is not continuously used. By comparison, patents and copyrights cannot be 'abandoned' and a patent holder or copyright owner can generally enforce their rights without taking any particular action to maintain the patent or copyright. Additionally, patent holders and copyright owners may not necessarily need to actively police their rights. However, a failure to bring a timely infringement suit or action against a known infringer may give the defendant a defense of implied consent or [[estoppel]] when suit is finally brought.

Like patents and copyrights, trademarks can be bought, sold, and transferred from one company or another. Unlike patents and copyrights, trademarks may not remain intact through this process. Where trademarks have been acquired for the purpose of marketing generic (non-distinctive) products, courts have refused to enforce them.

In 1923, the author [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] registered his fictitious character [[Tarzan]] as a trademark; even after the copyright to the Tarzan story expired, his [[Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.|company]] used ownership of the trademarks relating to the character (which unlike copyrights, do not have a limited length) to control the production of media using its imagery and [[Brand licensing|license]] the character for use in other works (such as adaptations). This practice is a precursor to the modern concept of a [[media franchise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-09/local/me-32680_1_jungle-heat|title=Law of the Jungle: Burroughs Descendants' Suit Says Adult Movie, Game Violate Trademark|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=December 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dilution=== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Libertarian perspectives on intellectual property]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Trademark dilution}}
A trademark is ''diluted'' when the use of similar or identical trademarks in other non-competing markets means that the trademark in and of itself will lose its capacity to signify a single source.  In other words, unlike ordinary trademark law, dilution protection extends to trademark uses that do not confuse consumers regarding who has made a product. Instead, dilution protection law aims to protect sufficiently strong trademarks from losing their singular association in the public mind with a particular product, perhaps imagined if the trademark were to be encountered independently of any product (e.g., just the word [[Pepsi]] spoken, or on a billboard).
Under trademark law, dilution occurs either when unauthorized use of a mark "blurs" the "distinctive nature of the mark" or "tarnishes it." Likelihood of confusion is not required. 15 U.S.C §§ 1127, 1125(c).

===Sale, transfer and licensing===
In various jurisdictions a trademark may be sold with or without the underlying [[goodwill (business)|goodwill]] which subsists in the business associated with the mark. However, this is not the case in the United States, where the courts have held that this would "be a fraud upon the public". In the U.S., trademark registration can therefore only be sold and assigned if accompanied by the sale of an underlying asset. Examples of assets whose sale would ordinarily support the assignment of a mark include the sale of the machinery used to produce the goods that bear the mark, or the sale of the corporation (or subsidiary) that produces the trademarked goods.

===Licensing===
Licensing means the trademark owner (the licensor) grants a permit to a third party (the licensee) in order to commercially use the trademark legally. It is a contract between the two, containing the scope of content and policy. The essential provisions to a trademark license identify the trademark owner and the licensee, in addition to the policy and the goods or services agreed to be licensed.

Most jurisdictions provide for the use of trademarks to be licensed to third parties. The licensor must monitor the quality of the goods being produced by the licensee to avoid the risk of trademark being deemed abandoned by the courts. A trademark license should therefore include appropriate provisions dealing with quality control, whereby the licensee provides warranties as to quality and the licensor has rights to inspection and monitoring.

===Domain names===
The advent of the [[domain name system]] has led to attempts by trademark holders to enforce their rights over domain names that are similar or identical to their existing trademarks, particularly by seeking control over the domain names at issue. As with dilution protection, enforcing trademark rights over domain name owners involves protecting a trademark outside the obvious context of its consumer market, because domain names are global and not limited by goods or service.

This conflict is easily resolved when the domain name owner actually uses the domain to compete with the trademark owner. [[Cybersquatting]], however, does not involve competition. Instead, an unlicensed user registers a domain name identical to a trademark, and offers to sell the domain to the trademark owner. [[Typosquatting|Typosquatters]]—those registering common misspellings of trademarks as domain names—have also been targeted successfully in trademark infringement suits.  "[[Gripe site]]s", on the other hand, tend to be protected as free speech, and are therefore more difficult to attack as trademark infringement.

This clash of the new technology with preexisting trademark rights resulted in several high-profile decisions as the courts of many countries tried to coherently address the issue (and not always successfully) within the framework of existing trademark law.  As the website itself was not the product being purchased, there was no actual consumer confusion, and so [[initial interest confusion]] was a concept applied instead. Initial interest confusion refers to customer confusion that creates an initial interest in a competitor's "product" (in the online context, another party's website).  Even though initial interest confusion is dispelled by the time any actual sales occur, it allows a trademark infringer to capitalize on the goodwill associated with the original mark.

Several cases have wrestled with the concept of initial interest confusion. In [[Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp.]] the court found initial interest confusion could occur when a competitor's trademarked terms were used in the [[HTML]] metatags of a website, resulting in that site appearing in the search results when a user searches on the trademarked term. In ''[[Playboy v. Netscape]]'', the court found initial interest confusion when users typed in Playboy's trademarks into a search engine, resulting in the display of search results alongside unlabeled banner ads, triggered by keywords that included Playboy's marks, that would take users to Playboy's competitors. Though users might ultimately realize upon clicking on the banner ads that they were not Playboy-affiliated, the court found that the competitor advertisers could have gained customers by appropriating Playboy's goodwill since users may be perfectly happy to browse the competitor's site instead of returning to the search results to find the Playboy sites.

In [[Lamparello v. Falwell]], however, the court clarified that a finding of initial interest confusion is contingent on financial profit from said confusion, such that, if a domain name confusingly similar to a registered trademark is used for a non-trademark related website, the site owner will not be found to have infringed where they do not seek to capitalize on the mark's goodwill for their own commercial enterprises.

In addition, courts have upheld the rights of trademark owners with regard to commercial use of domain names, even in cases where goods sold there legitimately bear the mark. In the landmark decision Creative Gifts, Inc. v. UFO, 235 F.3d 540 (10th Cir. 2000) (New Mexico), defendants had registered the domain name "Levitron.com" to sell goods bearing the trademark "Levitron" under an at-will license from the trademark owner. The 10th Circuit affirmed the rights of the trademark owner with regard to said domain name, despite arguments of [[promissory estoppel]].

Most courts particularly frowned on cybersquatting, and found that it was itself a sufficiently commercial use (i.e., "trafficking" in trademarks) to reach into the area of trademark infringement.  Most jurisdictions have since amended their trademark laws to address domain names specifically, and to provide explicit remedies against cybersquatters.

In the US, the legal situation was clarified by the [[Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act]], an amendment to the Lanham Act, which explicitly prohibited cybersquatting. It defines cybersquatting as "(occurring) when a person other than the trademark holder registers the domain name of a well-known trademark and then attempts to profit from this by either ransoming the domain name back to the trademark holder or using the domain name to divert business from the trademark holder to the domain name holder".&lt;ref&gt;Bosley Medical Institute, Inc v Bosley Medical Group, 403 F.3d 672, 680 (9th Cir. 2005)(quoting DaimlerChrysler v The Net Inc. 388 F.3d 201, 204 (6th Cir. 2004))&lt;/ref&gt; The provision states that "[a] person shall be liable in a civil action by the owner of the mark ... if, without regard to the goods or services of the person, that person (i) had a bad faith intent to profit from the mark ...; and registers, traffics in, or uses domain name [that is confusingly similar to another's mark or dilutes another's mark]".&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|15|1125}}(d)(1)(A)&lt;/ref&gt;

This international legal change has also led to the creation of [[ICANN]] [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]] (UDRP) and other dispute policies for specific countries (such as [[Nominet UK]]'s [[Dispute Resolution Service|DRS]]) which attempt to streamline the process of resolving who should own a domain name (without dealing with other infringement issues such as damages).  This is particularly desirable to trademark owners when the domain name registrant may be in another country or even anonymous.

Registrants of domain names also sometimes wish to register the domain names themselves (e.g., "XYZ.COM") as trademarks for perceived advantages, such as an extra bulwark against their domain being hijacked, and to avail themselves of such remedies as ''confusion'' or [[passing off (legal term)|passing off]] against other domain holders with confusingly similar or intentionally misspelled domain names.

As with other trademarks, the domain name will not be subject to trademark registration unless the proposed mark is actually used to identify the registrant's goods or services to the public, rather than simply being the location on the Internet where the applicant's web site appears. [[Amazon.com]] is a prime example of a protected trademark for a domain name central to the public's identification of the company and its products.

Terms which are not protectable by themselves, such as a generic term or a merely descriptive term that has not acquired secondary meaning, may become registerable when a Top-Level Domain Name (e.g. dot-COM) is appended to it. An example of such a domain name ineligible for trademark or service mark protection as a generic term, but which currently has a registered U.S. service mark, is "HEARSAY.COM".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/index.jsp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among trademark practitioners there remains a great deal of debate around trademark protection under [[ICANN]]'s proposed generic top-level domain name space expansion. [[World Trademark Review]] has been reporting on the at times fiery discussion between trademark owners and domainers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/daily/Detail.aspx?g=0332a6d5-8494-4466-a8f1-6e1de82bdafd|title=The STIckler: inside the latest trademark protection gTLD discussion - Blog - World Trademark Review|publisher=|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law==
Although there are systems which facilitate the filing, registration or enforcement of trademark rights in more than one jurisdiction on a regional or global basis, it is currently not possible to file and obtain a single trademark registration which will automatically apply around the world. Like any national law, trademark laws apply only in their applicable country or jurisdiction, a quality which is sometimes known as "territoriality".

===Territorial application===
The inherent limitations of the territorial application of trademark laws have been mitigated by various [[intellectual property]] [[treaty|treaties]], foremost amongst which is the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]]. TRIPS establishes legal compatibility between member jurisdictions by requiring the [[harmonisation of law|harmonization]] of applicable laws. For example, Article 15(1) of TRIPS provides a definition for "sign" which is used as or forms part of the definition of "trademark" in the trademark legislation of many jurisdictions around the world.

===Madrid system===
{{Main article|Madrid system}}

The major international system for facilitating the registration of trademarks in multiple jurisdictions is commonly known as the "Madrid system". Madrid provides a centrally administered system for securing trademark registrations in member jurisdictions by extending the protection of an "international registration" obtained through the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]]. This international registration is in turn based upon an application or registration obtained by a trade mark applicant in its home jurisdiction.

The primary advantage of the Madrid system is that it allows a trademark owner to obtain trademark protection in many jurisdictions by filing one application in one jurisdiction with one set of fees, and make any changes (e.g. changes of name or address) and renew registration across all applicable jurisdictions through a single administrative process. Furthermore, the "coverage" of the international registration may be extended to additional member jurisdictions at any time.

===Trademark Law Treaty===
The Trademark Law Treaty establishes a system pursuant to which member jurisdictions agree to standardize procedural aspects of the trademark registration process. It is not necessarily respective of rules within individual countries.&lt;ref&gt;Full text of the [http://alpilaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Full_text_Trademark_Law_Treaty.pdf Trademark Law Treaty.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community Trademark system===
{{Main article|European Union trade mark}}

The EU Trade Mark (EUTM) system (formerly the Community Trademark system) is the trademark system which applies in the [[European Union]], whereby registration of a trademark with the [[European Union Intellectual Property Office]] (EUIPO, formerly Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs)), leads to a registration which is effective throughout the EU as a whole. The EUTM system is therefore said to be unitary in character, in that an EUTM registration applies indivisibly across all [[European Union member states]]. However, the CTM system did not replace the national trademark registration systems; the CTM system and the national systems continue to operate in parallel to each other (see also [[Trade mark law of the European Union|European Union trade mark law]]).

Persons residing outside the EU must have professional representative to the procedures before EUIPO, while representation is recommended for EU residents.

One of the tasks of an EUTM owner is the monitoring of the later applications whether any of those is similar to his/her earlier trademark. Monitoring is not easy and usually requires professional expertise. To conduct a monitoring there is the so-called Trademark Watching service where it can be checked if someone tries to get registered marks that are similar to the existing marks.

Oppositions should be filed on the standard opposition form in any official language of the European Union, however, the substantive part of the opposition (e.g. the argumentations) can be submitted only in the language of the opposed application, that is one of the working languages of the EUIPO, e.g. English, Spanish, German.

===Well-known status===
Well-known trade mark status is commonly granted to famous international trade marks in less-developed legal jurisdictions.

Pursuant to Article 6 ''bis'' of the [[Paris Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;Paris Convention: [http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/paris/trtdocs_wo020.html#P151_21198 Article 6 bis, Paris Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; countries are empowered to grant this status to marks that the relevant authority considers are 'well known'. In addition to the standard grounds for trade mark infringement (same/similar mark applied same/similar goods or services, and a likelihood of confusion), if the mark is deemed well known it is an infringement to apply the same or a similar mark to dissimilar goods/services where there is confusion, including where it takes unfair advantage of the well-known mark or causing detriment to it.&lt;ref&gt;Hong Kong Trade Marks Ordinance section dealing with infringement: [http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/b8ad171ad6e831894825697d0028e34e?OpenDocument Cap 559, s.18]&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known trademark does not have to be registered in the jurisdiction to bring a trade mark infringement action (equivalent to bringing a [[passing off]] claim without having to show goodwill and having a lesser burden of proof).{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

===Protection of well-known marks===

Many countries protect unregistered well-known marks in accordance with their international obligations under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement). Consequently, not only big companies but also SMEs may have a good chance of establishing enough goodwill with customers so that their marks may be recognized as well-known marks and acquire protection without registration. It is, nevertheless, advisable to seek registration, taking into account that many countries provide for an extended protection of registered well-known marks against dilution (Art. 16.3 TRIPS),&lt;ref name="Paris Convention 1967"&gt;[Article 6bis of the Paris Convention (1967) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to goods or services which are not similar to those in respect of which a trademark is registered, provided that use of that trademark in relation to those goods or services would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the owner of the registered trademark and provided that the interests of the owner of the registered trademark are likely to be damaged by such use]&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., the reputation of the mark being weakened by the unauthorized use of that mark by others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/sme/en/ip_business/marks/well_known_marks.htm WIPO]&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of trademark laws merely implement obligations under Article 16.3&lt;ref name="Paris Convention 1967"/&gt; of the TRIPS Agreement and protect well-known registered trademarks only under the following conditions: 1- that the goods and services for which the other mark is used or is seeking protection are not identical with or similar to the goods for which the well-known mark acquired its reputation 2- that the use of the other mark would indicate a connection between these goods and the owner of the well-known mark, and 3 – that their interests are likely to be damaged by such use.

'''Transitional Style''' (also known as "updated classic for men", "classic with a contemporary twist", "new takes on old classics") in [[interior design]] and [[furniture design]] refers to a contemporary blend of traditional and modern styles, midway between old world traditional and the world of chrome and glass contemporary; incorporating lines that are less ornate than traditional designs, but not as severely basic as contemporary lines. As a result, transitional furniture designs are classic, timeless, and clean.

Curves combine with straight lines in a transitional style interior to deliver a look that balances both masculine and feminine attributes for a comfortable and relaxing, uncomplicated design. A lack of ornamentation and decoration with minimal accessories keeps the focus on the simplicity and sophistication of the design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hgtv.com/decorating/transitional-style/index.html  |title=HGTV, Transitional Style |publisher=Hgtv.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Color palettes are typically neutral and subtle and may be monochromatic, with color in art and accents, not upholstery and floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeportfolio.com/design-styles/style-defined-transitional.html |title=Transitional Style Defined by Lisa Frederick |date= |accessdate=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike contemporary furniture, transitional style focuses on comfort and practicality to meet the lifestyle of an active household. The scales of furniture pieces are ample but not overwhelming. Goose feather and down fill is typically used for [[upholstered]] furniture, [[wood species]] (maple, mahogany, walnut, etc.) and wood finishing is typically warm tones but can range from a natural finish to a high-gloss [[lacquer]]. Texture is important, and a multitude of fabric selections can vary from durable materials to sophisticated, plush fabrics, with tone-on-tone or small scale graphics.  A balanced mix of several textures is often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nteriordesign.lovetoknow.com/transitional_style_interior_design.html |title=Transitional Style Interior Design by Michelle Radcliffe | date= |access-date=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trina Robbins''' (born Trina Perlson, 1938)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Riesman |first1=Abraham |title=The Story of Trina Robbins, the Controversial Feminist Who Revolutionized Comic Books |url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/04/meet-trina-robbins-the-feminist-who-revolutionized-comics.html |work=Vulture |date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[People of the United States|American]] cartoonist. She was an early and influential participant in the [[underground comix]] movement, and one of the first few female artists in that movement. Both as a cartoonist and historian, Robbins has long been involved in creating outlets for and promoting female comics artists. In the 1980s, Robbins became the first woman to draw ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' comics. She is a member of the [[Will Eisner Hall of Fame]].

==Career==

=== Early work ===
Robbins was an active member of [[science fiction fandom]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Her illustrations appeared in [[science fiction fanzines]] like the [[Hugo Award|Hugo]]-[[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine|nominated]] [[Habakkuk (fanzine)|''Habakkuk'']].

=== Comics ===
Robbins' first comics were printed in the ''[[East Village Other]]''; she also contributed to the spin-off underground comic ''[[Gothic Blimp Works]]''.

In 1969, Robbins designed the costume for the [[Warren Publishing]] character [[Vampirella]], for artist [[Frank Frazetta]] in ''Vampirella'' #1 (Sept. 1969).&lt;ref name=arndt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enjolrasworld.com/Richard%20Arndt/The%20Warren%20Magazines%20Index%20Only.htm | first=Richard J.|last=Arndt|title=The Warren Magazines| publisher=EnjolrasWorld.com | date = September 22, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710194128/http://enjolrasworld.com/Richard%20Arndt/The%20Warren%20Magazines%20Index%20Only.htm| archivedate=July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She left New York for [[San Francisco]] in 1970, where she worked at the feminist [[underground newspaper]] ''It Ain't Me, Babe''. That same year she, along with fellow female artist [[Barbara "Willy" Mendes]], established the first all-woman comic book, the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[It Ain't Me, Babe (comic)|''It Ain't Me, Babe Comix'']].&lt;ref name="Krensky74"&gt;Krensky, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan79&gt;Kaplan, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; From this period on, Robbins became increasingly involved in creating outlets for and promoting female comics artists, through projects such as the [[comics anthology]] ''[[Wimmen's Comix]]'', with which she was involved for twenty years. ''Wimmen's Comix'' #1 featured Robbins' "Sandy Comes Out", the first-ever comic strip featuring an "out" [[lesbian]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Arie. ''Masters of the Comic Book Universe Revealed!''. (Chicago Review Press, 2006) {{ISBN|1-55652-633-4}}, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Robin (July 31, 1994). "Where Women Rule: The World of Lesbian Cartoons". ''The Harvard Gay &amp; Lesbian Review'' 1 (3): 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins became increasingly outspoken in her beliefs, criticizing underground comix artist [[Robert Crumb]] for the perceived misogyny of many of his comics. She said, "It's weird to me how willing people are to overlook the hideous darkness in Crumb's work&amp;nbsp;... What the hell is funny about rape and murder?"&lt;ref name="Sabin-92"&gt;Sabin, Roger (1996). "Going underground". ''Comics, Comix &amp; Graphic Novels: A History Of Comic Art''. London, United Kingdom: Phaidon Press. pp. 92. {{ISBN|0-7148-3008-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s Robbins created adaptations of [[Sax Rohmer]]'s ''Dope'' and [[Tanith Lee]]'s ''[[The Silver Metal Lover]]''. In the mid-1980s she wrote and drew ''Misty'' for the [[Marvel Comics]] children's imprint [[Star Comics]]. The short-lived series was a reinterpretation of the long-standing character [[Millie the Model]], now an adult running her own modeling agency and minding her niece Misty.

Robbins' official involvement with [[Wonder Woman]], a character she had long admired, began in 1986. At the conclusion of the first volume of the series (in conjunction with the series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''), [[DC Comics]] published a four-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] titled ''The Legend of Wonder Woman'', written by [[Kurt Busiek]] and drawn by Robbins. Robbins was the first woman to draw Wonder Woman comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ultra Nerdy |url=http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2014/11/05/trina-robbins-wonder-woman-comics/ |title=Q &amp; A with Trina Robbins – first woman to draw Wonder Woman comics (with video) &amp;#124; Vancouver Sun |publisher=Blogs.vancouversun.com |date=2014-11-05 |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series paid homage to the character's [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] roots. She also appeared as herself in ''Wonder Woman Annual 2'' (1989). In the mid-1990s, Robbins criticized artist [[Mike Deodato]]'s "[[bad girl art]]" portrayal of Wonder Woman, calling Deodato's version of the character a "barely clothed hypersexual [[pin-up girl|pinup]]."&lt;ref&gt;Trina Robbins, ''The Great Women Superheroes'' (Kitchen Sink Press, 1996) {{ISBN|0-87816-481-2}}, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, Robbins collaborated with [[Colleen Doran]] on the [[DC Comics]] graphic novel ''Wonder Woman: The Once and Future Story'', on the subject of [[spousal abuse]].

Robbins has been writing the comic book adventures of [[Honey West]], notable as being one of popular fiction's first female [[private detective]]s.

=== Writing and activism ===
In addition to her comics work, Robbins is an author of nonfiction books on the history of women in cartooning.

Her first book, co-written with [[Catherine Yronwode]], was ''Women and the Comics,'' a history of female comic-strip and comic-book creators. As one of the first books ever published on this subject, it was covered in the mainstream press, in addition to the fan press.&lt;ref&gt;"Women in the Comics: Assertive and Independent Women Make a Comeback" [[Miami Herald]] (newspaper), December 1, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Comic Books Are For Adults Too" by William Singleton, Scripps Howard News Service, Chronicle-Telegram (newspaper), January 7, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Funny How Things Change" ''Daily Herald'' (newspaper), December 28, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent Robbins volumes on women in the comics industry include ''A Century of Women Cartoonists'' (Kitchen Sink, 1993), ''The Great Women Superheroes'' (Kitchen Sink, 1997), ''From Girls to Grrrlz: A History of Women’s Comics from Teens to Zines'' (Chronicle, 1999), and ''The Great Women Cartoonists'' (Watson-Guptill, 2001). Her most recent work, ''Pretty In Ink'', published by Fantagraphics, covers the history of North American women in comics from Rose O'Neill's 1896 strip ''The Old Subscriber Calls'' to present.&lt;ref&gt;added Pretty in Ink reference&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins was a co-founder of [[Friends of Lulu]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilonsky, Robert (May 18, 2000). "Fatal femmes: Why do women in comics become Women in Refrigerators?". ''Dallas Observer''.&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit formed in 1994 to promote readership of comic books by women and the participation of women in the comic book industry.

Robbins is featured in the feminist history film ''[[She's Beautiful When She's Angry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com/women/|title=The Women|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com/the-film/ |title=The Film — She's Beautiful When She's Angry |publisher=Shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Robbins was intimately involved in the 1960s rock scene, where she was close friends with [[Jim Morrison]] and [[The Byrds]]. She is the first of the three "Ladies of the Canyon" in [[Joni Mitchell]]'s classic song from the album of the [[Ladies of the Canyon (album)|same name]].&lt;ref name=Weller293&gt;Weller, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s she ran an East Village clothing boutique called "Broccoli" and made clothes for [[Mama Cass]], [[Donovan]], [[David Crosby]] and others.&lt;ref name="hollywoodhangover1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodhangover.com/htm_files/part_eight.htm |title=Fresh Photos - Part Eight |publisher=Hollywoodhangover.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has written a memoir entitled ''Last Girl Standing'', scheduled for release in 2017 from [[Fantagraphics]].
