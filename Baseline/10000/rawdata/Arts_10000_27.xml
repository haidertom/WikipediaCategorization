[[File:A Frank Statement.png|thumb|''A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers'']]
'''''A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers'''''&amp;nbsp;was a historic first [[Tobacco advertising|advertisement]] in a campaign&amp;nbsp;run by major American&amp;nbsp;[[tobacco]]&amp;nbsp;[[Tobacco industry|companies]]&amp;nbsp;on January 4, 1954, to create doubt by disputing recent scientific studies linking smoking&amp;nbsp;[[cigarettes]]&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;[[lung cancer]] and other dangerous&amp;nbsp;[[Health effects of tobacco|health effects]].&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tobacco.org/Documents/dd/ddfrankstatement.html|title=Daily Doc: The "Frank Statement" of 1954|last=|first=|date=2017-11-07|website=www.tobacco.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaching an estimated 43 million people through more than 400 newspapers throughout the United States, ''A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers'' and subsequent advertisements were designed by public relations firm [[Hill &amp; Knowlton]] to [[Social engineering (political science)|socially engineer]] the public's perceptions of tobacco and to instill doubt about scientific research linking disease and smoking.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/900540359|title=Up in smoke : from legislation to litigation in tobacco politics|last=Martha|first=Derthick|publisher=CQ Press|year=|isbn=1452202230|edition=Third|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=33–41|oclc=900540359}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of ''A Frank Statement'' and tobacco advertisements that still exist today, the tobacco industry continues to expand its markets by avoiding health concerns and portraying its products in a positive light.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236761/|title=TOBACCO ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION|last=Youths|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Preventing Nicotine Addiction in Children and|last2=Lynch|first2=Barbara S.|last3=Bonnie|first3=Richard J.|date=1994|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

Reports of a link between tobacco and lung cancer emerged as early as 1912, but until the 1950s, the evidence was circumstantial since smoking was so pervasive in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thun|first=Michael J|date=2005|title=When truth is unwelcome : the first reports on smoking and lung cancer : Public Health Classics|url=http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/73130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, hoping to find the cause of the significant surge in lung cancer incidence in the US and England, [[Richard Doll|Dr. Richard Doll]] and [[Austin Bradford Hill|Professor Bradford Hill]] conducted a [[case-control study]] in which [[lung cancer]], other cancer, and non-cancer patients from twenty London-area hospitals were interviewed about their smoking habits. The study, published in the ''[[The BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'', found that the lung cancer patients were more likely to be heavier smokers than the other cancer and non-cancer control patients.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doll|first=Richard|last2=Hill|first2=A. Bradford|date=1950-09-30|title=Smoking and Carcinoma of the Lung|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=2|issue=4682|pages=739–748|issn=0007-1447|pmc=2038856|pmid=14772469|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4682.739}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results revealed to the medical community that a link between smoking and lung cancer may exist. Smoking was so prevalent that before these results were published, the increase in lung cancer incidence was attributed to the growing presence of automobiles, roads, and factories in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/ep/ep713_history/EP713_History8.html|title=Epidemiology of Chronic Diseases|last=LaMorte|first=Wayne W.|date=October 18, 2017|website=sphweb.bumc.bu.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wynder and Graham Figure 3.png|thumb|Wynder and Graham's study found that lung cancer patients were more likely to be heavier smokers than the other cancer and non-cancer control patients.]]
In 1950, [[Ernst Wynder|Dr. Ernst Wynder]] and [[Evarts Ambrose Graham]] published a study in the [[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]] in which they interviewed 684 people with proven cases of lung cancer about their smoking habits. The study found that heavy and sustained usage of tobacco, especially in the form of cigarettes, increased the likelihood of developing of lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wynder|first=Ernest L.|last2=Graham|first2=Evarts A.|date=1985-05-24|title=Tobacco Smoking as a Possible Etiologic Factor in Bronchiogenic Carcinoma: A Study of Six Hundred and Eighty-Four Proved Cases|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/398680|journal=JAMA|volume=253|issue=20|pages=2986–2994|doi=10.1001/jama.1985.03350440064033|issn=0098-7484|pmc=2623809}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, to study the biological likelihood of cancer being linked to smoking, [[Ernst Wynder|Wynder]] published an animal study in the US journal ''[[Cancer Research (journal)|Cancer Research]]'' that found that tobacco tar was [[carcinogen]]ic when applied to the skin of mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/795182557|title=Drugs-- without the hot air : minimising the harms of legal and illegal drugs|last=Nutt|first=David|date=2012|publisher=UIT|year=|isbn=1906860165|location=Cambridge, England|pages=201–202|oclc=795182557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The&amp;nbsp;December 1952 issue of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' featured an article, titled ''Cancer by the Carton,'' that discussed these recent studies on the link between smoking and lung cancer. The article presented to the public the studies' conclusion that tobacco causes lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/bcm92f00/pdf|title=Cancer by the Carton|last=Norr|first=Roy|date=December 1952|website=legacy.library.ucsf.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;As a result, the article provoked a health scare, which resulted in a small drop in consumption, and a fall in stock prices.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

In 1954, Doll and Hill published another article in the ''British Medical Journal'' releasing the results of the&amp;nbsp;[[British Doctors Study]],&lt;nowiki/&gt;which revealed a significant pattern of increased death from lung cancer as the amount of tobacco smoked increased.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doll|first=Richard|last2=Hill|first2=A. Bradford|date=1954-06-26|title=The Mortality of Doctors in Relation to Their Smoking Habits|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=4877|pages=1451–1455|issn=0007-1447|pmc=2085438|pmid=13160495|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.4877.1451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, which were the immediate post-war years and the beginning of the [[Atomic Age|nuclear age]], science was very highly regarded by the public, so the accumulating scientific evidence linking tobacco to lung cancer posed a major threat to the tobacco companies' public image.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Allan M.|date=January 2012|title=Inventing Conflicts of Interest: A History of Tobacco Industry Tactics|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=102|issue=1|pages=63–71|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2011.300292|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3490543|pmid=22095331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social engineering ==
With mounting evidence of a link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer, tobacco companies faced a dilemma of whether to admit to or deny the health risks of smoking. In order to preserve their industry, the tobacco companies opted to completely deny health risks. Instead, the tobacco companies crafted a strategy that, through creative advertising and marketing, would manipulate the cultural context surrounding their product from one that regarded the product unfavorably to one that held the product in high esteem. This strategy is known as [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]].&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

On December 15, 1953, led by Paul Hahn, the head of [[American Tobacco Company|American Tobacco]], the six major tobacco companies ([[American Tobacco Company|American Tobacco Co.]], [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]], [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]], [[Benson &amp; Hedges]], [[U.S. Tobacco Company|U.S. Tobacco Co.]], and Brown &amp; Williamson) met with public relations company [[Hill &amp; Knowlton]] in New York City to create an advertisement that would assuage the public's fears and create a false sense of security in order to regain the public's confidence in the tobacco industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-09-18/magazine/tm-40179_1_tobacco-industry|title=Tobacco's Pr Campaign :  The Cigarette Papers|last=Goodman|first=Michael J.|date=1994-09-18|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill and Knowlton's president, [[John W. Hill]], realized that simply denying the health risks would not be enough to convince the public. Instead, a more effective method would be to create a major scientific controversy in which the scientifically established link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer would appear not to be conclusively known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tobaccotactics.org/index.php?title=Hill_%26_Knowlton|title=Hill &amp; Knowlton|last=University of Bath|first=|date=October 17, 2012|website=www.TobaccoTactics.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tobacco companies fought against the emerging science by producing their own science, which suggested that existing science was incomplete and that the industry was not motivated by self-interest.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; With the creation of the [[Tobacco Institute|Tobacco Industry Research Committee]], headed by accomplished scientist [[C. C. Little|C.C. Little]], the tobacco companies manufactured doubt and turned scientific findings into a topic of debate. The recruitment of credentialed scientists like Little who were skeptics was a crucial aspect of the tobacco companies' social engineering plan to establish credibility against [[Tobacco control|anti-smoking reports]]. By amplifying the voices of a few skeptical scientists, the industry created an illusion that the larger scientific community had not reached a conclusive agreement on the link between smoking and cancer.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

Internal documents released through [[whistleblower]]s and [[Lawsuit|litigation]], such as the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]], reveal that while advertisements like ''A Frank Statement'' made tobacco companies appear to be responsible and concerned for the health of their consumers, in reality, they were deceiving the public into believing that smoking did not have health risks. The whole project was aimed at protecting the tobacco companies' images of glamour and all-American individualism at the cost of the public's health.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bates, Clive, and Andy Rowell. "[http://www.who.int/tobacco/media/en/TobaccoExplained.pdf Tobacco Explained]" (PDF). World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims==
''A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers'' claims:
# That medical research of recent years indicates many possible causes of lung cancer.
# That there is no agreement among the authorities regarding what the cause is.
# That there is no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the causes.
# That statistics purporting to link cigarette smoking with the disease could apply with equal force to any one of many other aspects of modern life. Indeed, the validity of the statistics themselves is questioned by numerous scientists.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;
The claims made in ''A Frank Statement'' were largely false as:
# Recent medical research had indicated that while lung cancer does have many possible causes, smoking is by far the leading cause in many different types of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM195204032461405|title=Some Practical Aspects of Cancer Prevention|last=Wynder|first=Ernest L.|date=April 3, 1952|website=The New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|doi=10.1056/nejm195204032461405|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Most scientists, except for skeptics hired by the tobacco companies, agreed that cigarette smoking is linked to lung cancer incidence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Multiple studies have shown a clear link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
# The studies linking cigarette smoking to lung cancer controlled for the "many other aspects of modern life" to show that cigarette smoking is the main cause.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Many of the "numerous scientists" who questioned the validity of the statistics were under the payroll of the tobacco companies.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

==Promises==
The advertisement also made several promises on behalf of the tobacco industry which were later disputed by the scientific community. In ''A Frank Statement,'' the tobacco companies stated that they believed that their products were safe; however, in a 2002 assessment of the promises made by the advertisement, it was concluded that some tobacco industry scientists believed that there was a [[Causality|causal relationship]] between tobacco and cancer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummings|first=K. M.|last2=Morley|first2=C. P.|last3=Hyland|first3=A.|date=March 2002|title=Failed promises of the cigarette industry and its effect on consumer misperceptions about the health risks of smoking|journal=Tobacco Control|volume=11 Suppl 1|pages=I110–117|doi=10.1136/tc.11.suppl_1.i110|issn=0964-4563|pmc=1766060|pmid=11893821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research was undertaken to find a safer cigarette, but tobacco companies realized that they could not produce a safer cigarette because doing so would mean admitting that current cigarettes were not safe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, the industry responded to the growing public concern by marketing their cigarettes as having [[Cigarette filter|filters]], milder smoke, and lower tar and [[Nicotine dependence|nicotine]] content; however, they did not acknowledge a causal link with cancer until 1999.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''A Frank Statement'' also pledged "aid and assistance to the research effort into all phases of tobacco use and health," and announced the establishment of the [[Tobacco Institute|Tobacco Industry Research Committee]] (TIRC) to work towards that goal.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Much of the TIRC funded research was not directly connected to smoking as it focused mainly on cancer basics, such as [[immunology]], [[genetics]], [[cell biology]], [[pharmacology]], and [[virology]], rather than cancer's connection to smoking.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Neither the TIRC nor its successor, the Council for Tobacco Research, ever acknowledged a proven link between smoking and serious and/or life-threatening illness. When research did find a link between smoking and cancer, however, the findings were rarely reported to the public.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite the irrelevance of much of the TIRC funded research to the health effects of smoking, the tobacco industry continued to publicize its funding of the TIRC to reassure the public.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In reality, the TIRC was created as a public relations measure for the purposes of discrediting independent science and portraying the tobacco companies as transparent and concerned for the well-being of their customers.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

Finally, the advertisement promised that the tobacco companies "always have and always will cooperate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the public health."&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; According to Cummings, Morley, and Hyland, "there is abundant evidence that the tobacco industry went to great lengths to undermine tobacco control efforts of the public health community."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An example of this is a memo from the vice-president of the [[Tobacco Institute]] in which the industry's strategy was described as "creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it", and "advocating the public's right to smoke, without actually urging them to take up the practice."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By proclaiming that the health risks were not conclusively linked to smoking, the tobacco companies manipulated the situation to place all liability on the consumer rather than on themselves.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

== Impact on the public ==
Although the tobacco industry claims that their advertising is only used to convince current smokers to switch between brands and that it does not increase total cigarette consumption, research into the effects of advertising shows that it plays an essential role in projecting positive connotations of smoking cigarettes onto potential new smokers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From 1954, when Hill &amp; Knowlton first started working with the tobacco industry, to 1961, the number of cigarettes sold annually rose from  369 billion to 488 billion, and the annual per capita consumption rose from 3344 to 4025 cigarettes.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

The [[Tobacco advertising|first cigarette advertisements]] claimed that smoking cigarettes had a variety of health benefits, such as prolonged youth, thinness, and attractiveness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, as more research revealed the deceptiveness of these claims, tobacco companies began to use advertisements, like ''A Frank Statement,'' to deny that their products caused cancer. Claiming that advertisement bans would infringe on "commercial [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]," the tobacco industry has continually fought against them; however, the industry has never responded to criticism that much of its advertising, like the claims made in ''A Frank Statement,'' is deceptive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, the tobacco industry's manipulation of science as a public relations tactic is still used today in debates on a wide variety of subjects including [[global warming]], [[Genetically modified organism|food]], and [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceuticals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brownell|first=Kelly D.|last2=Warner|first2=Kenneth E.|date=March 2009|title=The perils of ignoring history: Big Tobacco played dirty and millions died. How similar is Big Food?|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=87|issue=1|pages=259–294|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00555.x|issn=1468-0009|pmc=2879177|pmid=19298423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern-day examples ==
Today, tobacco companies continue to aggressively advertise cigarettes. As cigarette consumption has declined in the United States, tobacco companies have greatly increased their advertising expenditure. In 1991, the industry spent $4.6 billion on advertising and promoting cigarette consumption,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and in 2015, tobacco companies spent $8.9 billion on advertising just in the United States.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/tobacco_industry/marketing/index.htm|title=CDC - Fact Sheet - Tobacco Industry Marketing - Smoking &amp; Tobacco Use|last=Health|first=CDC's Office on Smoking and|date=2017-11-16|website=Smoking and Tobacco Use|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco companies continue to use this money to fund social engineering techniques, such as campaigns featuring themes of social desirability and specific cultural references, to target women, children, and specific racial/ethnic communities.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, to make cigarettes appealing to African American communities, the industry has implemented campaigns that use urban culture and language while sponsoring Chinese and Vietnamese New Year festivals to target Asian Americans.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

With declining levels of smoking in the West due to [[List of smoking bans|smoking bans]] and increased education on the health risks of smoking, tobacco companies have also expanded their market into [[Developing country|developing countries]] to fulfill the industry's ever-present need for new smokers and more money. Using many of the same advertising techniques of glamour, sex, and independence, the industry has begun to target women and children in Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where government bans and health education may not be as prevalent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13920">Crusader Art is mainly viewed as a mixture of western and eastern art traditions which is due primarily to many different backgrounds of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Lucy-Anne|date=1991|title=Art and Colonialism: The Mosaics of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem (1169) and the Problem of "Crusader" Art|jstor=1291693|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|volume=45|pages=69–85|doi=10.2307/1291693}}&lt;/ref&gt; It spanned two artistic periods in Europe, the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and the [[Gothic art|Gothic]], but in the [[Crusader kingdoms]] of the [[Levant]] the Gothic style barely appeared.  The military crusaders themselves were mostly not noticeably interested in artistic matters, or sophisticated in their taste, and much of their art was destroyed in the loss of their kingdoms so that only a few pieces survive today.  Probably their most notable and influential artistic achievement was the [[Crusader castle]]s, many of which achieve a stark, massive beauty. They developed the [[Byzantine]] methods of city-fortification for stand-alone [[castle]]s far larger than any constructed before, either locally or in Europe.

The crusaders encountered a long and rich artistic tradition in the lands they conquered at the end of the 11th century and the beginning of the 12th. [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Islamic art]] (that of both the [[Arabs]] and the [[Seljuk Turks|Turks]]) were the dominant styles in the [[Crusader states]], although there were also the styles of the indigenous [[Demographics of Syria|Syrians]] and [[Armenians]]. These indigenous styles were incorporated into styles brought by the crusaders from Europe, which were themselves highly varied, stemming from [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[England]], and elsewhere. On the whole the Eastern Christian styles were more significant influences than Islamic art; the artists working in the Crusader lands are assumed to have had the same variety of backgrounds.

Crusader art, like the history of the Crusader kingdoms in general, falls clearly into two, or three, periods.  The first begins with the [[First Crusade]] which culminated in 1099 with the bloody [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|taking of Jerusalem]] and the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and other states to the north. In the second period the Kingdom of Jerusalem was now hugely reduced in size to control only a few coastal towns and the areas around them, which were gradually whittled away by the Muslims until the final [[Siege of Acre (1291)]] ended Crusader presence in the [[Levant]]. The third period of Crusader art, which is not counted as such by all sources, is often found in Cyprus in the Gothic style.&lt;ref&gt;Folda restricts himself to the art of the "[[Holy Land]]" or "Syria-Palestine", Folda, I, 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically Crusader Art falls into two categories; the artist creates art in their native style and ignore their new surroundings, or they try to copy the Byzantine style so precisely that their nationality is almost indiscernible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weitzmann|first=Kurt|date=1966|title=Icon Painting in the Crusader Kingdom|jstor=1291242|journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers|volume=20|pages=49–83|doi=10.2307/1291242}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Melisende-Psalter f9v.jpg|thumb|right|305x305px|''the Harrowing of Hell'' from the [[Melisende Psalter]]]]

== Illuminated Manuscripts ==
An illuminated manuscript is a manuscript that has some painted design on it whether it be a small picture or a border or even just initials. An example of the mixture of different styles is the [[Melisende Psalter]], an [[illuminated manuscript]]; the Psalter was commissioned by Queen [[Melisende of Jerusalem]] between 1131 and 1143 and contains many miniatures.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; It reflects her European and Armenian heritage, and is also influenced by Byzantine and Islamic techniques. The [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]] was an important centre where a school of manuscript and [[icon]] painting that blended European and local influences emerged. Unfortunately many of the manuscripts were destroyed.  Artists who can be identified on stylistic grounds as originating in [[France]] and [[Italy]] ([[Venice]] and [[Apulia]]) worked there, producing work mixing Byzantine and Western conventions, but usually with lettering in Greek. There was also a scriptorium in Acre which produced many well known manuscripts such as Missals and Arsenal bibles.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Another example of Crusader Art manuscripts would be the Last Judgement miniatures from an eleventh century Gospel book and similar Last Judgement miniatures in an Armenian Gospel book painted by T'oros Roslin in 1262.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Many of the manuscripts that are crusader style manuscripts were commissioned by King Louis IX, especially in the city of Acre.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/229033386|title=Crusader art : the art of the Crusaders in the Holy Land, 1099-1291|last=Jaroslav.|first=Folda,|date=2008|publisher=Lund Humphries|isbn=9780853319955|location=Aldershot|oclc=229033386}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of an illuminated manuscript that was commissioned by King Louis IX and is a result of crusader art is the frontispiece of Proverbs 1 in the Arsenal Bible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This manuscript shows Solomon wearing the traditional insignia and clothing of a Byzantine emperor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This illumination is a mixture of the Gothic and Franco-Byzantine Crusader styles, and also showcases French architecture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More manuscripts done in a similar style to the Arsenal Bible include a few Missals, and a Psalter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Most of the significant surviving illuminated manuscripts were produced in the 13th century, about half in the last forty years of the Latin kingdom; to what extent this is an accident of survival is unclear.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Mosaics, Frescoes and Panel Paintings==
[[File:Israel Abu Ghosh BW 4.JPG|thumb|left|Frescos at [[Abu Ghosh]].]]Another example of the mixture of styles is the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in Jerusalem, the renovation and rebuilding of which was completed in 1149; however only fragments of the large programme of [[mosaic]]s now survive. A mosaic is a type of art that uses of glass shards, tiles or small pebbles in order to create a picture. Some icons in wall painting and mosaic survive from the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref&gt;Folda, I, 28&lt;/ref&gt;  A very well known Crusader Art mosaic is the Torcello mosaic of the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Hospitaller]] church at [[Abu Ghosh]], apparently then regarded as the biblical [[Emmaus]], was abandoned in 1187 but has good remains of [[fresco]]s. A fresco is a type of mural that was painted on a freshly plastered wall. An example of a Crusader Art Fresco would be the Last Judgement fresco in Vladimir which has been dated to the end of the twelfth century.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Another example of some Crusader Art frescoes are the frescoes at Lagoudhera on the island of Cyprus.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Panel paintings are paintings that were on a flat piece of wood which made moving them around possible. Some examples of panel paintings would include the panels containing busts of John the Baptist and Saint Andrew, which has a face that is so detailed with highlights and sharp lines that it seems almost ornamental when compared to other examples of Crusader Art.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Another example would be the diptych of King Andrew the Third of Hungary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A painting with many examples of Crusader Art would be an iconostasis beam that contains: Virgin of the Crucifixion, the Pentecost and Birth of Christ combined with the Adoration of the Magi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Sculpture==
[[File:Church of the Annunciation Crusaders Capital 200704.JPG|thumb|left|Capital from the [[Basilica of the Annunciation|Church of the Annunciation]] in [[Nazareth]] - (?) one of those buried in 1187]]
Figurative [[monumental sculpture]] in [[relief]] was, some earlier Armenian work apart, not part of local Christian traditions, so the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] sculpture of Europe, especially France, was much the largest influence.  Discussion of the varied styles by art historians typically involves only various areas in Europe, mostly in France.  Many elements were re-used in later buildings, and have now re-appeared, often badly damaged. Original work has survived at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, whose carved [[lintel]]s are now in the [[Rockefeller Museum]] in the city, and was removed from the destroyed Church of Santa Maria Latina nearby.

Another major pilgrimage basilica, the [[Basilica of the Annunciation|Church of the Annunciation]] in [[Nazareth]], was just nearing the completion of a major rebuilding in 1187. Saladin in fact left the Christians in place and does not seem to have damaged the building. However the church was seriously damaged in the next major upheaval in the area, the invasion in 1267 by the [[Mamluk]] ruler [[Baybars]], and the sculptures remaining from the church all suffered.  In 1908 five extra capitals were excavated, having, it is presumed, been buried in 1187 soon after they were made but before they were put in place, when news of Saladin's approach reached the town.  These are in excellent condition, and some of the most famous sculptures of the Crusader period.&lt;ref&gt;Folda, I, 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation is rather different with decorative sculpture, where local influence is much stronger.  The beautifully carved and complex decoration on the arches and cornices over the doors into the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is unlike anything in France from this period and reflects local development of Syrian late Roman styles; some parts are probably re-used Roman material.  The neighbouring capitals, "based on [[Justinian the Great|Justinianic]] models, are probably the work of local Christian sculptors working for the Latins".&lt;ref&gt;Setton and Hazard, 270&lt;/ref&gt;

==The End of Crusader Art==

After the rapid collapse of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] in 1187, which must have destroyed a great part of the artwork the crusaders produced,&lt;ref&gt;discussed in detail at Folda, I, 23-28&lt;/ref&gt; they were mostly confined to a few cities on the [[Mediterranean]] coast until [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] was conquered in 1291. Their artistic output did not cease during the 13th century, and shows further influences from the art of the [[Mamluk]]s and [[Mongols]].

In Cyprus, the Lusignan kingdom continued to produce work, including the Gothic cathedrals of [[Famagusta]] ([[Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque]]) and [[Nicosia]] ([[Haydarpasha Mosque]]/Saint Catherine and [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Selimiye Mosque]]/Saint Sophia Cathedral), all later used as [[mosque]]s and relatively well-preserved (minus their figurative sculpture).

== Influences on Europe ==
There was also crusade-related art produced back in Europe, from the many illuminated crusade chronicles such as the [[Old French]] translation of [[William of Tyre]], to architecture such as the round churches built by the [[Knights Templar]] in the style of the Holy Sepulchre, and the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris built to accommodate relics brought back from the East.  Luxurious printed textiles began to be produced in Europe at around the end of the Crusades, and may well have been another influence. In general, it is often not possible to say with certainty whether influences or new types of objects arriving in Europe at this period did so via Islamic Spain, the Byzantine world, or the Crusader states. Historians tend to discount the importance of the Crusader States in this regard, despite the very well developed Italian trading networks there. European [[castle]]-building was certainly decisively influenced by the crusaders.

[[File:William Morris design for Trellis wallpaper 1862.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|[[William Morris]] design for "Trellis" wallpaper, 1862]]
The '''Arts and Crafts movement''' was an international movement in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920, emerging in Japan (the [[Mingei]] movement) in the 1920s. It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms, and often used medieval, romantic, or folk styles of decoration. It advocated economic and social reform and was essentially anti-industrial.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moses N. Ikiugu and Elizabeth A.

King, ''Silk and Empire''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and influences==
===Design reform===
The Arts and Crafts movement emerged from the attempt to reform design and decoration in mid 19th century Britain. It was a reaction against a perceived decline in standards that the reformers associated with machinery and factory production. Their critique was sharpened by the items they saw in [[the Great Exhibition of 1851]], which they considered to be excessively ornate, artificial and ignorant of the qualities of the materials used.


The art historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] has said that exhibits in the Great Exhibition showed "ignorance of that basic need in creating patterns, the integrity of the surface" and "vulgarity in detail".&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; Design reform began with the organisers of the Exhibition itself, [[Henry Cole]] (1808–1882), [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]] (1809–1874), [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]] (1820–1877) and [[Richard Redgrave]] (1804–1888),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/w/wallpaper-design-reform/ V&amp;A, "Wallpaper Design Reform"]&lt;/ref&gt; who deprecated excessive ornament and impractical and badly made things.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} The organisers were "unanimous in their condemnation of the exhibits."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=20}} Owen Jones, for example, complained that "the architect, the upholsterer, the paper-stainer, the weaver, the calico-printer, and the potter" produce "in art novelty without beauty, or beauty without intelligence."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=20}} From these criticisms of the contemporary state of manufactured goods emerged several publications which set out what the writers considered to be the correct principles of design. Richard Redgrave's ''Supplementary Report on Design'' (1852) analysed the principles of design and ornament and pleaded for "more logic in the application of decoration."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} Other works followed in a similar vein: Wyatt's ''Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century'' (1853), [[Gottfried Semper]]'s ''Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst'' ("Science, Industry and Art") (1852), [[Ralph Wornum]]'s ''Analysis of Ornament'' (1856), Redgrave's ''Manual of Design'' (1876) and Jones's ''Grammar of Ornament'' (1856).{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} The ''Grammar of Ornament'' was particularly influential, liberally distributed as a student prize and running into nine reprints by 1910.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}}

Jones declared that "Ornament ... must be secondary to the thing decorated", that there must be "fitness in the ornament to the thing ornamented", and that wallpapers and carpets must not have any patterns "suggestive of anything but a level or plain".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Nikolaus Pevsner, ''Pioneers of Modern Design''&lt;/ref&gt; Where a fabric or wallpaper in the Great Exhibition might be decorated with a natural motif made to look as real as possible, these writers advocated flat and simplified natural motifs. Redgrave insisted that "style" demanded sound construction before ornamentation, and a proper awareness of the quality of materials used. "''Utility'' must have precedence over ornamentation."{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=22}}

[[File:Kelmscott Press - The Nature of Gothic by John Ruskin (first page).jpg|thumb|upright|''The Nature of Gothic'' by John Ruskin, printed by William Morris at the Kelmscott Press in 1892 in his [[Golden Type]] inspired by the 15th century printer [[Nicolas Jenson]]. This chapter from ''The Stones of Venice'' was a sort of manifesto for the Arts and Crafts movement.]]

However, the design reformers of the mid 19th century did not go as far as the designers of the Arts and Crafts Movement: they were more concerned with ornamentation than construction, they had an incomplete understanding of methods of manufacture,{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=22}} and they did not criticise industrial methods as such. By contrast, the Arts and Crafts movement was as much a movement of social reform as design reform and its leading practitioners did not separate the two.

===A. W. N. Pugin===
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
[[File:The Grange, Ramsgate 1.jpg|thumb|right|Pugin's house, "The Grange", in Ramsgate, 1843. Its simplified Gothic style, adapted to domestic building, helped shape the architecture of the Arts and Crafts Movement.]]

Some of the ideas of the movement were anticipated by [[A.W.N. Pugin]] (1812–1852), a leader in the [[Gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival in architecture]]. For example, he, like the Arts and Crafts artists, advocated truth to material, structure and function.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A /&gt; Pugin articulated the tendency of social critics to compare the faults of modern society (such as the sprawling growth of cities and the treatment of the poor) unfavorably with the Middle Ages,&lt;ref name=hill&gt;Rosemary Hill, ''God's Architect: Pugin and the Building of Romantic Britain'', London: Allen Lane, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; a tendency that became routine with Ruskin, Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. His book ''Contrasts'' (1836) drew examples of bad modern buildings and town planning in contrast with good medieval examples, and his biographer [[Rosemary Hill]] notes that in it he "reached conclusions, almost in passing, about the importance of craftsmaship and tradition in architecture that it would take the rest of the century and the combined efforts of Ruskin and Morris to work out in detail." She describes the spare furnishings he specified for a building in 1841—"rush chairs, oak tables"—as "the Arts and Crafts interior in embryo."&lt;ref name=hill /&gt;

===John Ruskin===
{{expand section|date=December 2014}}
The Arts and Crafts philosophy derived in large measure from [[John Ruskin]]'s social criticism, which related the moral and social health of a nation to the qualities of its architecture and to the nature of work. Ruskin (1819–1900) considered the sort of mechanized production and division of labour that had been created in the [[industrial revolution]] to be "servile labour" and he thought that a healthy and moral society required independent workers who designed the things they made. His followers favoured craft production over industrial manufacture and were concerned about the loss of traditional skills, but they were arguably more troubled by the effects of the [[factory system]] than by machinery itself&lt;ref name=sarsby&gt;Jacqueline Sarsby" Alfred Powell: Idealism and Realism in the Cotswolds", ''Journal of Design History'', Vol. 10, No. 4, pp. 375-397&lt;/ref&gt; and William Morris's idea of "handicraft" was essentially work without any division of labour rather than work without any sort of machinery.&lt;ref name=pye&gt;David Pye, ''The Nature and Art of Workmanship'', Cambridge University Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Morris===
[[File:William Morris age 53.jpg|thumb|upright|William Morris, the main influence on the Arts and Crafts Movement]]
[[William Morris]] (1834–1896), the towering figure in late 19th century design, was the main influence on the Arts and Crafts movement. The aesthetic and social vision of the Arts and Crafts movement derived from ideas he developed in the 1850s with a group of students at the [[University of Oxford]], who combined a love of [[Romantic literature]] with a commitment to social reform.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|pp=96-97}} By 1855 they had discovered Ruskin and, believing there to be a contrast between the barbarity of contemporary art and the painters preceding [[Raphael]] (1483-1530), they formed themselves into the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] to pursue their artistic aims. The [[medieval]]ism of [[Mallory]]'s ''[[Morte d'Arthur]]'' set the standard for their early style.{{sfn|Wildman|1998|p=49}} In [[Edward Burne-Jones]]' words, they intended to "wage Holy warfare against the age".{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=97}}

[[File:The Red House, Bexleyheath.JPG|thumb|William Morris's [[Red House (London)|Red House]] in London designed by Philip Webb. Completed 1860, it is one of the most significant buildings of the Arts and Crafts Movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/red-house#Overview National Trust, "Iconic Arts and Crafts home of William Morris"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Morris began experimenting with various crafts and designing [[furniture]] and [[interior design|interiors]].{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}} He was personally involved in manufacture as well as design,{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}} which was to be the hallmark of the Arts and Crafts movement. Ruskin had argued that the separation of the intellectual act of design from the manual act of physical creation was both socially and aesthetically damaging; Morris further developed this idea, insisting that no work should be carried out in his workshops before he had personally mastered the appropriate techniques and materials, arguing that "without dignified, creative human occupation people became disconnected from life".{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}}

[[File:Morris and Company Weaving at Merton Abbey.jpg|thumb|The weaving shed in Morris &amp; Co's factory at [[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]], which opened in the 1880s]]

In 1861 Morris began making furniture and decorative objects commercially, modeling his designs on medieval styles and using bold forms and strong colors. His patterns were based on flora and fauna  and his products were inspired by the vernacular or domestic traditions of the British countryside. In order to display the beauty of the materials and the work of the craftsman, some were deliberately left unfinished, creating a rustic appearance. Truth to materials, structure and function became characteristic of the Arts and Crafts movement.

Unlike their counterparts in the United States, most Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain had strong, slightly incoherent, negative feelings about machinery. They thought of 'the craftsman' as free, creative, and working with his hands, 'the machine' as soulless, repetitive, and inhuman. These contrasting images derive in part from John Ruskin's (1819-1900) ''The Stones of Venice'', an architectural history of Venice that contains a powerful denunciation of modern industrialism to which Arts and Crafts designers returned again and again. Distrust for the machine lay behind the many little workshops that turned their backs on the industrial world around 1900, using preindustrial techniques to create what they called 'crafts.'

===Critique of industry===
William Morris shared Ruskin's critique of industrial society and at one time or another attacked the modern factory, the use of machinery, the division of labour, capitalism and the loss of traditional craft methods. But his attitude to machinery was inconsistent. He said at one point that production by machinery was "altogether an evil",&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; but at others he was willing to commission work from manufacturers who were able to meet his standards with the aid of machines;&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Shankland, "William Morris - Designer", in Asa Briggs (ed.) ''William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980 {{ISBN|0-14-020521-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he said that, in a "true society", where neither luxuries nor cheap trash were made, machinery could be improved and used to reduce the hours of labour.&lt;ref&gt;William Morris, "Useful Work versus Useless Toil", in Asa Briggs (ed.) ''William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980 {{ISBN|0-14-020521-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiona MacCarthy says that "unlike later zealots like [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], William Morris had no practical objections to the use of machinery ''per se'' so long as the machines produced the quality he needed."{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|p=351}}

Morris insisted that the artist should be a craftsman-designer working by hand&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; and advocated a society of free craftspeople, such as he believed had existed during the Middle Ages. "Because craftsmen took pleasure in their work", he wrote, "the Middle Ages was a period of greatness the art of the common people. ... The treasures in our museums now are only the common utensils used in households of that age, when hundreds of medieval churches—each one a masterpiece—were built by unsophisticated peasants."&lt;ref name=mingei/&gt; Medieval art was the model for much Arts and Crafts design and medieval life, literature and building was idealised by the movement.

Morris's followers also had differing views about machinery and the factory system. [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C.&amp;nbsp;R. Ashbee]], for example, a central figure in the Arts and Crafts Movement, said in 1888, that, "We do not reject the machine, we welcome it. But we would desire to see it mastered."&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashbee, C.&amp;nbsp;R., ''A Few Chapters on Workshop Construction and Citizenship'', London, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; After unsuccessfully pitting his Guild and School of Handicraft guild against modern methods of manufacture, he acknowledged that "Modern civilization rests on machinery",&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt; but he continued to criticize the deleterious effects of what he called "mechanism", saying that "the production of certain mechanical commodities is as bad for the national health as is the production of slave-grown cane or child-sweated wares."&lt;ref&gt;"C.&amp;nbsp;R. Ashbee, ''Should We Stop Teaching Art?'', New York and London: Garland, 1978, p.12 (Facsimile of the 1911 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Arthur Smith Benson]], on the other hand, had no qualms about adapting the Arts and Crafts style to metalwork produced under industrial conditions. (See quotation box.)

Morris and his followers believed the division of labour on which modern industry depended was undesirable, but the extent to which every design should be carried out by the designer was a matter for debate and disagreement. Not all Arts and Crafts artists carried out every stage in the making of goods themselves, and it was only in the twentieth century that that became essential to the definition of craftsmanship. Although Morris was famous for getting hands-on experience himself of many crafts (including weaving, dying, printing, calligraphy and embroidery), he did not regard the separation of designer and executant in his factory as problematic. Walter Crane, a close political associate of Morris's, took an unsympathetic view of the division of labour on both moral and artistic grounds, and strongly advocated that designing and making should come from the same hand. Lewis Foreman Day, a friend and contemporary of Crane's, as unstinting as Crane in his admiration of Morris, disagreed strongly with Crane. He thought that the separation of design and execution was not only inevitable in the modern world, but also that only that sort of specialisation allowed the best in design and the best in making.&lt;ref&gt;[https://marshallcolman.blogspot.co.uk/2017/06/designer-and-executant-argument-between.html Designer and Executant: An Argument Between Walter Crane and Lewis Foreman Day]&lt;/ref&gt;  Few of the founders of the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]] insisted that the designer should also be the maker. Peter Floud, writing in the 1950s, said that "The founders of the Society ... never executed their own designs, but invariably turned them over to commercial firms."&lt;ref name=floud&gt;Peter Floud, "The crafts then and now", ''The Studio'', 1953, p.127&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that the designer should be the maker and the maker the designer derived "not from Morris or early Arts and Crafts teaching, but rather from the second-generation elaboration doctrine worked out in the first decade of [the twentieth] century by men such as [[W. R. Lethaby]]".&lt;ref name=floud/&gt;

===Socialism===
Many of the Arts and Crafts Movement designers were socialists, including Morris, [[T. J. Cobden Sanderson]], [[Walter Crane]], C.R.Ashbee, [[Philip Webb]], [[Charles Joseph Faulkner|Charles Faulkner]] and [[A.H.Mackmurdo]].{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=109}} In the early 1880s Morris was spending more of his time on socialist propaganda than on designing and making.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=640-663}} Ashbee established a community of craftsmen, the Guild of Handicraft, in east London, later moving to [[Chipping Campden]].&lt;ref name=crawford/&gt; Those adherents who were not socialists, for example, [[Alfred Hoare Powell]],&lt;ref name=sarsby/&gt; advocated a more humane and personal relationship between employer and employee. [[Lewis Foreman Day]], a very successful and influential Arts and Crafts designer, was not a socialist either, despite his long friendship with Crane.

===Association with other reform movements===
{{expand section|date=November 2017}}
In Britain the movement was associated with [[dress reform]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/victorian-dress-at-v-and-a/ V&amp;A, "Victorian Dress at the V&amp;A"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[ruralism]], the [[garden city movement]]&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014&gt;Fiona MacCarthy, ''Anarchy and Beauty: William Morris and his Legacy 1860-1960'', London: National Portrait Gallery, 2014 {{ISBN|978 185514 484 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cecil Sharp|the folk-song revival]]. All were linked, in some degree, by the ideal of "the Simple Life".&lt;ref&gt;Fiona McCarthy. ''The Simple Life'', Lund Humphries, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; In continental Europe the movement was associated with the preservation of national traditions in building, the applied arts, domestic design and costume.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Development==
Morris's designs quickly became popular, attracting interest when his company's work was exhibited at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] in London. Much of Morris &amp; Co's early work was for churches and Morris won important interior design commissions at [[St James's Palace]] and the [[South Kensington Museum]] (now the Victoria and Albert Museum). Later his work became popular with the middle and upper classes, despite his wish to create a democratic art, and by the end of the 19th century, Arts and Crafts design in houses and domestic interiors was the dominant style in Britain, copied in products made by conventional industrial methods.

The spread of Arts and Crafts ideas during the late 19th and early 20th centuries resulted in the establishment of many associations and craft communities, although Morris had little to do with them because of his preoccupation with socialism at the time. A hundred and thirty Arts and Crafts organisations were formed in Britain, most between 1895 and 1905.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=602|}}

In 1881, [[Eglantyne Louisa Jebb]], [[Mary Fraser Tytler]] and others initiated the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]] to encourage the working classes, especially those in rural areas, to take up handicrafts under supervision, not for profit, but in order to provide them with useful occupations and to improve their taste. By 1889 it had 450 classes, 1,000 teachers and 5,000 students.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=120}}

In 1882, architect [[A.H.Mackmurdo]] formed the [[Century Guild of Artists|Century Guild]], a partnership of designers including [[Selwyn Image]], [[Herbert Horne]], Clement Heaton and [[Benjamin Creswick]].{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=591}}{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=115}}

In 1884, the [[Art Workers Guild]] was initiated by five young architects, [[William Lethaby]], [[Edward Schroeder Prior|Edward Prior]], [[Ernest Newton]], Mervyn Macartney and [[Gerald C. Horsley]], with the goal of bringing together fine and applied arts and raising the status of the latter. It was directed originally by [[George Blackall Simonds]]. By 1890 the Guild had 150 members, representing the increasing number of practitioners of the Arts and Crafts style.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=593}} It still exists.

The London department store [[Liberty &amp; Co.]], founded in 1875, was a prominent retailer of goods in the style and of the "[[artistic dress]]" favoured by followers of the Arts and Crafts movement.

In 1887 the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]], which gave its name to the movement, was formed with [[Walter Crane]] as president, holding its first exhibition in the [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]], London, in November 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Linda, ''William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement: A Sourcebook'', New York, Portland House, 1989 {{ISBN|0-517-69260-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first show of contemporary decorative arts in London since the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]'s Winter Exhibition of 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chestofbooks.com/arts/essays/Theoretical-Practical-Critical-Ideals/Of-The-Arts-And-Crafts-Movement-Part-4.html |title=Crane, Walter, "Of the Arts and Crafts Movement", in '&amp;#39;Ideals In Art: Papers Theoretical Practical Critical'&amp;#39;, George Bell &amp; Sons, 1905 |publisher=Chestofbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morris &amp; Co.]] was well represented in the exhibition with furniture, fabrics, carpets and embroideries. [[Edward Burne-Jones]] observed, "here for the first time one can measure a bit the change that has happened in the last twenty years".{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=596}} The society still exists as the Society of Designer Craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societyofdesignercraftsmen.org.uk/ |title=Society of Designer Craftsmen |publisher=Society of Designer Craftsmen |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C.R.Ashbee]], a major late practitioner of the style in England, founded the [[Guild and School of Handicraft]] in the East End of London. The guild was a craft co-operative modelled on the medieval guilds and intended to give working men satisfaction in their craftsmanship. Skilled craftsmen, working on the principles of Ruskin and Morris, were to produce hand-crafted goods and manage a school for apprentices. The idea was greeted with enthusiasm by almost everyone except Morris, who was by now involved with promoting [[socialism]] and thought Ashbee's scheme trivial. From 1888 to 1902 the guild prospered, employing about 50 men. In 1902 Ashbee relocated the guild out of London to begin an experimental community in [[Chipping Campden]] in the [[Cotswolds]]. The guild's work is characterized by plain surfaces of hammered silver, flowing wirework and colored stones in simple settings. Ashbee designed jewellery and silver tableware. The guild flourished at Chipping Camden but did not prosper and was liquidated in 1908. Some craftsmen stayed, contributing to the tradition of modern craftsmanship in the area.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Ashbee.htm |title=Utopia Britannica |publisher=Utopia Britannica |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtbarn.org.uk/home |title=Court Barn Museum |publisher=Courtbarn.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C.F.A. Voysey]] (1857–1941) was an Arts and Crafts architect who also designed fabrics, tiles, ceramics, furniture and metalwork.  His style combined simplicity with sophistication. His wallpapers and textiles, featuring stylised bird and plant forms in bold outlines with flat colors, were used widely.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A/&gt;

Morris's thought influenced the [[distributism]] of [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter, Joseph Nuttgens, London Review of Books, 13 May 2010 p 4&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the nineteenth century, Arts and Crafts ideals had influenced architecture, painting, sculpture, graphics, illustration, book making and photography, domestic design and the decorative arts, including furniture and woodwork, stained glass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cormack|first1=Peter|title=Arts and Crafts Stained Glass|date=2015|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0-300-20970-9|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt; leatherwork, lacemaking, embroidery, rug making and weaving, jewelry and metalwork, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]ing and ceramics.&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt; By 1910, there was a fashion for "Arts and Crafts" and all things hand-made. There was a proliferation of amateur handicrafts of variable quality&lt;ref&gt;"Arts and Crafts", ''Journal of the Royal Society of Arts'', Vol. 56, No. 2918, 23 October 1908, pp. 1023-1024&lt;/ref&gt; and of incompetent imitators who caused the public to regard Arts and Crafts as "something less, instead of more, competent and fit for purpose than an ordinary mass produced article."&lt;ref&gt;[[Noel Rooke]], "The Craftsman and Education for Industry", in ''Four Papers Read by Members of the Arts &amp; Crafts Exhibition Society'', London: Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society held eleven exhibitions between 1888 and 1916. By the outbreak of war in 1914 it was in decline and faced a crisis. Its 1912 exhibition had been a financial failure.&lt;ref name=harrod&gt;Tania Harrod, ''The Crafts in Britain in the 20th Century'', Yale University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-300-07780-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While designers in continental Europe were making innovations in design and alliances with industry through initiatives such as the [[Deutsche Werkbund]] and new initiatives were being taken in Britain by the [[Omega Workshops]] and the [[Design in Industries Association]], the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, now under the control of an old guard, was withdrawing from commerce and collaboration with manufacturers into purist handwork and what Tania Harrod describes as "decommoditisation"&lt;ref name=harrod/&gt; Its rejection of a commercial role has been seen as a turning point in its fortunes.&lt;ref name=harrod/&gt; Nikolaus Pevsner in his book ''Pioneers of Modern Design'' presents the Arts and Crafts Movement as design radicals who influenced the modern movement, but failed to change and were eventually superseded by it.&lt;ref name=pevsner/&gt;

===Later influences===
The British artist potter [[Bernard Leach]] brought to England many ideas he had developed in Japan with the social critic [[Yanagi Soetsu]] about the moral and social value of simple crafts; both were enthusiastic readers of Ruskin. Leach was an active propagandist for these ideas, which struck a chord with practitioners of the crafts in the inter-war years, and he expounded them in ''A Potter's Book'', published in 1940, which denounced industrial society in terms as vehement as those of Ruskin and Morris. Thus the Arts and Crafts philosophy was perpetuated among British craft workers in the 1950s and 1960s, long after the demise of the Arts and Crafts movement and at the high tide of Modernism. British [[Utility furniture]] of the 1940s also derived from Arts and Crafts principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/crd_desref.html Designing Britain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515141802/http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/crd_desref.html |date=May 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its main promoters, [[Sydney Gordon Russell|Gordon Russell]], chairman of the Utility Furniture Design Panel, was imbued with Arts and Crafts ideas. He manufactured furniture in the Cotswold Hills, a region of Arts and Crafts furniture-making since Ashbee, and he was a member of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. William Morris's biographer, [[Fiona MacCarthy]], detected the Arts and Crafts philosophy even behind the [[Festival of Britain]] (1951), the work of the designer [[Terence Conran]] (b. 1931)&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014/&gt; and the founding of the British [[Crafts Council]] in the 1970s.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=603}}

The movement spread to Ireland, representing an important time for the nation's cultural development, a visual counterpart to the literary revival of the same time&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Gordon Bowe, ''The Irish Arts and Crafts Movement (1886-1925)'', Irish Arts Review Yearbook, 1990-91, pp. 172-185&lt;/ref&gt; and was a publication of Irish nationalism. The Arts and Crafts use of stained glass was popular in Ireland, with [[Harry Clarke]] the best-known artist and also with [[Evie Hone]]. The architecture of the style is represented by the [[Honan Chapel]] (1916) in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in the grounds of [[University College Cork]]. Other architects practicing in Ireland included Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] (Heywood House in Co. Laois, Lambay Island and the [[Irish National War Memorial Gardens]] in Dublin) and Frederick 'Pa' Hicks ([[Malahide Castle]] estate buildings and round tower). Irish Celtic motifs were popular with the movement in silvercraft, carpet design, book illustrations and hand-carved furniture.

===Scotland===

The beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by [[James Ballantine]] (1808–77). His major works included the great west window of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and the scheme for [[St. Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by [[Daniel Cottier]] (1838–91), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. His key works included the ''Baptism of Christ'' in [[Paisley Abbey]], (c. 1880). His followers included Stephen Adam and his son of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The Glasgow-born designer and theorist [[Christopher Dresser]] (1834–1904) was one of the first, and most important, independent designers, a pivotal figure in the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and a major contributor to the allied [[Anglo-Japanese]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lyons, ''Christopher Dresser: The People Designer - 1834–1904'' (Antique Collectors' Club, 2005), {{ISBN|1851494553}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement had an "extraordinary flowering" in Scotland where it was represented by the development of the '[[Glasgow Style]]' which was based on the talent of the [[Glasgow School of Art]].  Celtic revival took hold here, and motifs such as the Glasgow rose became popularised. [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] and the Glasgow School of Art were to influence others worldwide.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dublin"&gt;Nicola Gordon Bowe and Elizabeth Cumming, ''The Arts And Crafts Movements in Dublin and Edinburgh''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental Europe===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}

In continental Europe, the revival and preservation of national styles was an important motive of Arts and Crafts designers; for example, in Germany, after unification in 1871 under the encouragement of the ''Bund für Heimatschutz'' (1897)&lt;ref&gt;Ákos Moravánszky, ''Competing visions: aesthetic invention and social imagination in Central European Architecture 1867-1918'', Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Vereinigte Werkstätten für Kunst im Handwerk'' founded in 1898 by Karl Schmidt; and in Hungary [[Károly Kós]] revived the vernacular style of [[Transylvania]]n building. In central Europe, where several diverse nationalities lived under powerful empires (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia), the discovery of the vernacular was associated with the assertion of national pride and the striving for independence, and, whereas for Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain the ideal style was to be found in the medieval, in central Europe it was sought in remote peasant villages.&lt;ref&gt;Andrej Szczerski, "Central Europe", in Karen Livingstone and Linda Parry (eds.), ''International Arts and Crafts'', London: V&amp;A Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Till en liten vira.jpg|thumb|The Swedish artists [[Carl Larsson]] and [[Karin Bergöö Larsson]] were inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement when designing their home.]]
Widely exhibited in Europe, the Arts and Crafts style's simplicity inspired designers like [[Henry van de Velde]] and styles such as [[Art Nouveau]], the Dutch [[De Stijl]] group, [[Vienna Secession]], and eventually the [[Bauhaus]] style. Pevsner regarded the style as a prelude to [[Modernism]], which used simple forms without ornamentation.&lt;ref name="pevsner" &gt;Nikolaus Pevsner, ''Pioneers of Modern Design'', Yale University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0-300-10571-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Arts and Crafts activity in continental Europe was in [[Belgium]] in about 1890, where the English style inspired artists and architects including can de Velde, [[Gabriel Van Dievoet]], [[Gustave Serrurier-Bovy]] and a group known as ''[[La Libre Esthétique]]'' (Free Aesthetic).

Arts and Crafts products were admired in Austria and Germany in the early 20th century, and under their inspiration design moved rapidly forward while it stagnated in Britain.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=183}} The [[Wiener Werkstätte]], founded in 1903 by [[Josef Hoffmann]] and [[Koloman Moser]], was influenced by the Arts and Crafts principles of the "unity of the arts" and the hand-made. The [[Deutscher Werkbund]] (German Association of Craftsmen) was formed in 1907 as an association of artists, architects, designers, and industrialists to improve the global competitiveness of German businesses and became an important element in the development of [[modern architecture]] and industrial design through its advocacy of standardized production. However, its leading members, van de Velde and [[Hermann Muthesius]], had conflicting opinions about standardization. Muthesius believed that it was essential were Germany to become a leading nation in trade and culture. Van de Velde, representing a more traditional Arts and Crafts attitude, believed that artists would forever "protest against the imposition of orders or standardization," and that "The artist ... will never, of his own accord, submit to a discipline which imposes on him a canon or a type." {{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=189}}

In Finland, an idealistic artists' colony in [[Helsinki]] was designed by [[Herman Gesellius]], [[Armas Lindgren]] and [[Eliel Saarinen]],&lt;ref name="grove"/&gt; who worked in the [[National Romantic style]], akin to the British [[Gothic Revival]].

In [[Hungary]], under the influence of Ruskin and Morris, a group of artists and architects, including [[Károly Kós]], [[Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch]] and Ede Toroczkai Wigand, discovered the [[folk art]] and vernacular architecture of [[Transylvania]]. Many of Kós's buildings, including those in the [[Budapest Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden|Budapest zoo]] and the [[Wekerle estate]] in the same city, show this influence.&lt;ref&gt;Széleky András, ''Kós Károly'', Budapest, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia, [[Viktor Hartmann]], [[Viktor Vasnetsov]], [[Yelena Polenova]] and other artists associated with [[Abramtsevo Colony]] sought to revive the quality of medieval Russian [[decorative arts]] quite independently from the movement in Great Britain.

In Iceland, [[Sölvi Helgason]]'s work shows Arts and Crafts influence.

In the United States, the Arts and Crafts style initiated a variety of attempts to reinterpret European Arts and Crafts ideals for Americans. These included the "Craftsman"-style architecture, furniture, and other decorative arts such as designs promoted by [[Gustav Stickley]] in his magazine, ''The Craftsman'' and designs produced on the Roycroft campus as publicized in Elbert Hubbard's ''The Fra''.  Both men used their magazines as a vehicle to promote the goods produced with the Craftsman workshop in Eastwood, NY and Elbert Hubbard's [[Roycroft]] campus in [[East Aurora, NY]]. A host of imitators of Stickley's furniture (the designs of which are often mislabelled the "[[American Craftsman|Mission Style]]") included three companies established by his brothers.

The terms ''[[American Craftsman]]'' or ''Craftsman style'' are often used to denote the style of architecture, interior design, and decorative arts that prevailed between the dominant eras of [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] in the USA, or approximately the period from 1910 to 1925.  The movement was particularly notable for the professional opportunities it opened up for women as artisans, designers and entrepreneurs who founded and ran, or were employed by, such successful enterprises as the [[Kalo Shops]], [[Rookwood Pottery]], and [[Tiffany Studios]]. In Canada, the term ''Arts and Crafts'' predominates, but ''Craftsman'' is also recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/acam/hd_acam.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art: Monica Obniski, "The Arts and Crafts Movement in America" |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=1972-02-20 |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Europeans tried to recreate the virtuous crafts being replaced by industrialisation, Americans tried to establish a new type of virtue to replace heroic craft production: well-decorated middle-class homes. They claimed that the simple but refined aesthetics of Arts and Crafts decorative arts would ennoble the new experience of industrial consumerism, making individuals more rational and society more harmonious. The American Arts and Crafts movement was the aesthetic counterpart of its contemporary political philosophy, [[progressivism]]. Characteristically, when the Arts and Crafts Society began in October 1897 in Chicago, it was at [[Hull House]], one of the first American [[settlement house]]s for social reform.&lt;ref name="Obniski"&gt;Obniski.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arts and Crafts ideals disseminated in America through journal and newspaper writing were supplemented by societies that sponsored lectures.&lt;ref name="Obniski"/&gt; The first was organized in Boston in the late 1890s, when a group of influential architects, designers, and educators determined to bring to America the design reforms begun in Britain by William Morris; they met to organize an exhibition of contemporary craft objects. The first meeting was held on January 4, 1897, at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] (MFA) in Boston to organize an exhibition of contemporary crafts. When craftsmen, consumers, and manufacturers realised the aesthetic and technical potential of the applied arts, the process of design reform in Boston started. Present at this meeting were General Charles Loring, Chairman of the Trustees of the MFA; [[William Sturgis Bigelow]] and [[Denman Ross]], collectors, writers and MFA trustees; Ross Turner, painter; [[Sylvester Baxter]], art critic for the ''Boston Transcript''; Howard Baker, [[Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, Jr.|A.W. Longfellow Jr.]]; and Ralph Clipson Sturgis, architect.

The first American Arts and Crafts Exhibition began on April 5, 1897, at [[Copley Hall, Boston]]{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} featuring more than 1000 objects made by 160 craftsmen, half of whom were women. Some of the advocates of the exhibit were Langford Warren, founder of Harvard's School of Architecture; Mrs. Richard Morris Hunt; Arthur Astor Carey and Edwin Mead, social reformers; and [[Will H. Bradley]], graphic designer. The success of this exhibition resulted in the incorporation of The Society of Arts and Crafts (SAC), on June 28, 1897, with a mandate to "develop and encourage higher standards in the handicrafts." The 21 founders claimed to be interested in more than sales, and emphasized encouragement of artists to produce work with the best quality of workmanship and design. This mandate was soon expanded into a credo, possibly written by the SAC's first president, [[Charles Eliot Norton]], which read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This Society was incorporated for the purpose of promoting artistic work in all branches of handicraft. It hopes to bring Designers and Workmen into mutually helpful relations, and to encourage workmen to execute designs of their own. It endeavors to stimulate in workmen an appreciation of the dignity and value of good design; to counteract the popular impatience of Law and Form, and the desire for over-ornamentation and specious originality. It will insist upon the necessity of sobriety and restraint, or ordered arrangement, of due regard for the relation between the form of an object and its use, and of harmony and fitness in the decoration put upon it.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, Beverly Kay. ''The Craftsman and the Critic: Defining Usefulness and Beauty in the Arts and Crafts-era Boston.'' University of Massachusetts Press, 2009. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also influential were the [[Roycroft]] community initiated by [[Elbert Hubbard]] in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and [[East Aurora, New York]], [[Joseph Marbella]],  utopian communities like [[Byrdcliffe Colony]] in [[Woodstock, New York]], and [[Rose Valley, Pennsylvania]], developments such as [[Mountain Lakes, New Jersey]], featuring clusters of bungalow and chateau homes built by Herbert J. Hapgood, and the contemporary studio craft style. [[Studio pottery]]—exemplified by the [[Grueby Faience Company]], [[Newcomb Pottery]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Marblehead Pottery]], [[Teco pottery]], [[Overbeck Sisters|Overbeck]] and [[Rookwood pottery]] and [[Mary Chase Perry Stratton]]'s [[Pewabic Pottery]] in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], as well as the art [[tile]]s made by [[Ernest A. Batchelder]] in [[Pasadena, California]], and idiosyncratic furniture of [[Charles Rohlfs]] all demonstrate the influence of Arts and Crafts.

====Architecture and Art====
The "[[Prairie School]]" of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[George Washington Maher]] and other architects in Chicago, the [[Country Day School movement]], the [[bungalow]] and [[ultimate bungalow]] style of houses popularized by [[Greene and Greene]], [[Julia Morgan]], and [[Bernard Maybeck]] are some examples of the American Arts and Crafts and [[American Craftsman]] style of architecture. Restored and landmark-protected examples are still present in America, especially in California in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], and the sections of other towns originally developed during the era and not experiencing post-war urban renewal. [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]], Prairie School, and the '[[California bungalow]]' styles of residential building remain popular in the United States today.

As theoreticians, educators, and prolific artists in mediums from printmaking to pottery and pastel, two of the most influential figures were [[Arthur Wesley Dow]] (1857-1922) on the East Coast and [[Pedro Joseph de Lemos]] (1882-1954) in California.  Dow, who taught at [[Columbia University]] and founded the Ipswich Summer School of Art, published in 1899 his landmark ''Composition'', which distilled into a distinctly American approach the essence of Japanese composition, combining into a decorative harmonious amalgam three elements: simplicity of line, "notan" (the balance of light and dark areas), and symmetry of color.&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Nancy E. and Jessie Poesch| title=Arthur Wesley Dow and American arts &amp; crafts| date=1999|publisher=Harry N. Abrams, Inc.| location=New York, NY|isbn=0810942178|pages=55–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His purpose was to create objects that were finely crafted and beautifully rendered.  His student de Lemos, who became head of the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], Director of the [[Stanford University]] Museum and Art Gallery, and Editor-in-Chief of the ''School Arts Magazine'', expanded and substantially revised Dow's ideas in over 150 monographs and articles for art schools in the United States and Britain.&lt;ref name="edwardsrw"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=Pedro de Lemos, Lasting Impressions: Works on Paper| date=2015|publisher=Davis Publications Inc.| location=Worcester, Mass.|isbn=9781615284054|pages=4–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his many unorthodox teachings was his belief that manufactured products could express "the sublime beauty" and that great insight was to be found in the abstract "design forms" of pre-Columbian civilizations.

===Asia===
In Japan, [[Yanagi Sōetsu]], creator of the [[Mingei]] movement which promoted folk art from the 1920s onwards, was influenced by the writings of Morris and Ruskin.&lt;ref name=mingei&gt;Elisabeth Frolet, Nick Pearce, Soetsu Yanagi and Sori Yanagi, ''Mingei: The Living Tradition in Japanese Arts'', Japan Folk Crafts Museum/Glasgow Museums, Japan: Kodashani International, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Arts and Crafts movement in Europe, Mingei sought to preserve traditional crafts in the face of modernising industry.

The movement ... represents in some sense a revolt against the hard mechanical conventional life and its insensibility to beauty (quite another thing to ornament). It is a protest against that so-called industrial progress which produces shoddy wares, the cheapness of which is paid for by the lives of their producers and the degradation of their users. It is a protest against the turning of men into machines, against artificial distinctions in art, and against making the immediate market value, or possibility of profit, the chief test of artistic merit. It also advances the claim of all and each to the common possession of beauty in things common and familiar, and would awaken the sense of this beauty, deadened and depressed as it now too often is, either on the one hand by luxurious superfluities, or on the other by the absence of the commonest necessities and the gnawing anxiety for the means of livelihood; not to speak of the everyday uglinesses to which we have accustomed our eyes, confused by the flood of false taste, or darkened by the hurried life of modern towns in which huge aggregations of humanity exist, equally removed from both art and nature and their kindly and refining influences.

Many of the leaders of the Arts and Crafts movement were trained as architects (e.g. William Morris, A. H. Mackmurdo, C. R. Ashbee, W. R. Lethaby) and it was on building that the movement had its most visible and lasting influence.

[[Red House (London)|Red House]], in [[Bexleyheath]], London, designed for Morris in 1859 by architect [[Philip Webb]], exemplifies the early Arts and Crafts style, with its well-proportioned solid forms, wide porches, steep roof, pointed window arches, brick fireplaces and wooden fittings.  Webb rejected classical and other revivals of historical styles based on grand buildings, and based his design on British [[vernacular architecture]], expressing the texture of ordinary materials, such as stone and tiles, with an asymmetrical and picturesque building composition.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/british_galleries/bg_styles/Style09a/index.html |title=Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The London suburb of [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]], built mainly in the 1880s and 1890s, has about 360 Arts and Crafts style houses and was once famous for its [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic]] residents. Several [[Almshouse]]s were built in the Arts and Crafts style, for example, [[Whiteley Village]], Surrey, built between 1914 and 1917, with over 280 buildings, and the [[Dyers Almshouses]], Sussex, built between 1939 and 1971. [[Letchworth Garden City]], the first garden city, was inspired by Arts and Crafts ideals.&lt;ref name=maccarthy2014/&gt; The first houses were designed by [[Richard Barry Parker|Barry Parker]] and [[Raymond Unwin]] in the [[vernacular]] style popularized by the movement and the town became associated with high-mindedness and simple living. The sandal-making workshop set up by [[Edward Carpenter]] moved from Yorkshire to Letchworth Garden City and [[George Orwell]]'s jibe about "every fruit-juice drinker, nudist, sandal-wearer, sex-maniac, Quaker, 'Nature Cure' quack, pacifist, and feminist in England" going to a socialist conference in Letchworth has become famous.&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, ''The Road to Wigan Pier''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Garden design==
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
[[Gertrude Jekyll]] applied Arts and Crafts principles to garden design. She worked with the English architect, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]], for whose projects she created numerous landscapes, and who designed her home ''[[Munstead Wood]]'', near Godalming in Surrey.&lt;ref&gt;Tankard, Judith B. and Martin A. Wood. Gertrude Jekyll at Munstead Wood. Bramley Books, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Jekyll created the gardens for ''Bishopsbarns'',&lt;ref name="HEBishopsbarns"&gt;{{NHLE|num=1256793 |desc=Bishopsbarns|accessdate=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the home of York architect [[Walter Brierley]], an exponent of the Arts and Crafts movement and known as the "Lutyens of the North".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/goddards-house-and-garden/documents/download-the-goddards-the-art-of-design-leaflet.pdf |title=The Art of Design |website=www.nationaltrust.org.uk| accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The garden for Brierley's final project, ''[[Goddards House and Garden|Goddards]]'' in York, was the work of George Dillistone, a gardener who worked with Lutyens and Jekyll at ''[[Castle Drogo]]''.&lt;ref name="HE1000452"&gt;{{NHLE|num=1000452 |desc=Castle Drogo park and garden|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''Goddards'' the garden incorporated a number of features that reflected the arts and crafts style of the house, such as the use of hedges and [[herbaceous border]]s to divide the garden into a series of outdoor rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/goddards-house-and-garden/features/the-gardens-at-goddards- |title=The Gardens at Goddards|website=www.nationaltrust.org.uk| accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable Arts and Crafts garden is ''[[Hidcote Manor Garden]]'' designed by [[Lawrence Johnston]] which is also laid out in a series of outdoor rooms and where, like ''Goddards'', the landscaping becomes less formal further away from the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hidcote/features/the-garden-at-hidcote |title=The Garden at Hidcote|website=www.nationaltrust.org.uk| accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of Arts and Crafts gardens include ''[[Hestercombe House|Hestercombe Gardens]]'', ''[[Lytes Cary|Lytes Cary Manor]]'' and the gardens of some of the architectural examples of arts and crafts buildings (listed above).

==Art education==
Morris's ideas were adopted by the [[New Education Movement]] in the late 1880s, which incorporated handicraft teaching in schools at Abbotsholme (1889) and [[Bedales]] (1892), and his influence has been noted in the social experiments of [[Dartington Hall]] during the mid-20th century.{{sfn|MacCarthy 1994|p=603}}

Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain were critical of the government system of art education based on design in the abstract with little teaching of practical craft. This lack of craft training also caused concern in industrial and official circles, and in 1884 a Royal Commission (accepting the advice of William Morris) recommended that art education should pay more attention to the suitability of design to the material in which it was to be executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morrissociety.org/publications/JWMS/AU94.11.1.HarveyPress.pdf Charles Harvey and Jon Press, "William Morris and the Royal Commission on Technical Instruction", ''Journal of the William Morris Society''  11.1, August 1994, pp. 31-34] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105132211/http://www.morrissociety.org/publications/JWMS/AU94.11.1.HarveyPress.pdf |date=2015-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first school to make this change was the [[Birmingham Art School|Birmingham School of Arts and Crafts]], which "led the way in introducing executed design to the teaching of art and design nationally (working in the material for which the design was intended rather than designing on paper). In his external examiner's report of 1889, Walter Crane praised Birmingham School of Art in that it 'considered design in relationship to materials and usage.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://fineart.ac.uk/institutions.php?idinst=9 "Birmingham Institute of Art and Design" fineart.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Under the direction of Edward Taylor, its headmaster from 1877 to 1903, and with the help of [[Henry Payne (artist)|Henry Payne]] and [[Joseph Southall]], the Birmingham School became a leading Arts-and-Crafts centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Everitt|first=Sian|title=Keeper of Archives|url=http://fineart.ac.uk/institutions.php?idinst=9|work=Birmingham Institute of Art and Design|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other local authority schools also began to introduce more practical teaching of crafts, and by the 1890s Arts and Crafts ideals were being disseminated by members of the Art Workers Guild into art schools throughout the country. Members of the Guild held influential positions: Walter Crane was director of the [[Manchester School of Art]] and subsequently the [[Royal College of Art]]; F.M. Simpson, [[Robert Anning Bell]] and C.J.Allen were respectively professor of architecture, instructor in painting and design, and instructor in sculpture at [[Liverpool School of Art]]; Robert Catterson-Smith, the headmaster of the Birmingham Art School from 1902-1920, was also an AWG member; [[W. R. Lethaby]] and [[George Frampton]] were inspectors and advisors to the [[London County Council]]'s (LCC) education board and in 1896, largely as a result of their work, the LCC set up the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]] and made them joint principals.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt; Until the formation of the Bauhaus in Germany, the Central School was regarded as the most progressive art school in Europe.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=179}} Shortly after its foundation, the [[Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts]] was set up on Arts and Crafts lines by the local borough council.

As head of the Royal College of Art in 1898, Crane tried to reform it along more practical lines, but resigned after a year, defeated by the bureaucracy of the [[Board of Education]], who then appointed Augustus Spencer to implement his plan. Spencer brought in Lethaby to head its school of design and several members of the Art Workers' Guild as teachers.&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;Stuart Macdonald, ''The History and Philosophy of Art Education'', London: University of London Press, 1970.  {{ISBN|0 340 09420 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years after reform, a committee of inquiry reviewed the RCA and found that it was still not adequately training students for industry.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Departmental Committee on the Royal College of Art'', HMSO, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; In the debate that followed the publication of the committee's report, C.R.Ashbee published a highly critical essay, ''Should We Stop Teaching Art'', in which he called for the system of art education to be completely dismantled and for the crafts to be learned in state-subsidised workshops instead.&lt;ref&gt;C.R.Ashbee, ''Should We Stop Teaching Art?'', 1911&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Foreman Day]], an important figure in the Arts and Crafts movement, took a different view in his dissenting report to the committee of inquiry, arguing for greater emphasis on principles of design against the growing orthodoxy of teaching design by direct working in materials. Nevertheless, the Arts and Crafts ethos thoroughly pervaded British art schools and persisted, in the view of the historian of art education, Stuart MacDonald, until after the Second World War.&lt;ref name=macdonald/&gt;

'''Bartolomeo Bimbi''' (15 May 1648 &amp;ndash; 1729) was a [[Florence|Florentine]] painter of [[still lifes]], commissioned by his patrons including [[Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo III, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] to paint large canvases of flora and fauna for the Medici Villa dell'Ambrogiana and della Topaia, now conserved in the [[Pitti Palace]] and the Museo Botanico dell'Universita. 

==Life and Work==
Son of Nicolò, he was born in [[Settignano]] on May 15, 1648; in about 1661 he entered the workshop of [[Lorenzo Lippi]], where he remained until the death of the master (1665); then he joined [[Onorio Marinari]] as his apprentice. After a trip to Rome with Cardinal [[Leopoldo de' Medici]], he began working for the Florentine court and aristocracy. Although his training made him suitable for figure painting, Bimbi is known almost exclusively for his activity as a painter of still lifes and portraits. 

Bimbi died in Florence on 14 January 1729.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trkulja|first1=Silvia Meloni|title=- Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 10 (1968)|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/bartolomeo-bimbi_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|website=Treccani|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He partly was following the tradition of [[Jacopo Ligozzi]] in documenting the botanical collections of the Medici. He was a pupil of [[Lorenzo Lippi]] and [[Onorio Marinari]]. Others claim he was a pupil of [[Angelo Gori]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first= Maria|last= Farquhar| year=1855| title= Biographical catalogue of the principal Italian painters|  editor = [[Ralph Nicholson Wornum]] | page = 26| publisher=  Woodfall &amp; Kinder, Angel Court, Skinner Street, London; Digitized by Googlebooks from Oxford University copy on Jun 27, 2006| id= | url= https://books.google.com/books?q=intitle:Wornum+intitle:principal+intitle:painters | authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Blam''''' (sometimes '''''Blam!''''') is a 1962  painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] falling within the [[pop art]] idiom. It is one of his military comic book derivatives and was one of the works presented at his first solo exhibition. The work is in the collection at the [[Yale University Art Gallery]].

==History==
[[File:Blam source.jpg|thumb|left|The source for ''Blam'' was All American Men of War #89 (January–February 1962)]]
The painting is based on [[Russ Heath]]'s art in the [[comic book]] ''[[All-American Men of War]]'' issue #89 (January-February 1962), published by [[DC Comics|National Periodical Publications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://image-duplicator.com/main.php?work_id=0213&amp;year=1964&amp;decade=60|title=Ohhh&amp;nbsp;... Alright&amp;nbsp;... |accessdate=May 20, 2012|publisher=Lichtenstein Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting depicts a pilot ejecting from an exploding plane.&lt;ref name=PAACH/&gt;  The same issue was the inspiration for several other Lichtenstein paintings, ''[[Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!]]'', ''[[Brattata]]'', ''[[Whaam!]]'' and ''Tex!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4381129|title=High &amp; Low: Modern Art &amp; Popular Culture: Searching High and Low|author= Armstrong,  Matthew|volume=2|issue=6|date=Autumn 1990|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]|pages=4–8, 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The graphite pencil sketch, ''[[Jet Pilot (Roy Lichtenstein)|Jet Pilot]]'' was also from that issue.&lt;ref name="ID 3163"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://image-duplicator.com/main.php?work_id=3163&amp;year=1962&amp;decade=60# | title = Jet Pilot | accessdate = June 24, 2013 | publisher = LichtensteinFoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lichtenstein had his first solo show at The [[Leo Castelli Gallery]] in February 1962, it sold out before opening.  ''Blam'' sold for $1000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1962}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), according to one source,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Mural With Blue Brushstroke|author=Tomkins, Calvin|isbn=0-8109-2356-4|page=25|date=1988|publisher=[[Harry N.

==Details==
[[File:Roy Lichtenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Lichtenstein in 1967]]
Lichtenstein began his war imagery efforts with single frame pictures such as ''Blam''.&lt;ref name=PAACH&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: A Continuing History|author=Livingstone, Marco|publisher=[[Harry N. Abrams]]|isbn=0-8109-3707-7|date=1990|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blam'' uses quintessential war imagery. Although the text is limited to one four-letter word, the narrative is unnecessary owing to the eminent realism presented.  The canvas is loaded with images surrounding the focal figure, of the aircraft under attack.&lt;ref name=RLDW&gt;{{cite book|title= Roy Lichtenstein|author=Waldman, Diane|date=1993|publisher=[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]|page=95|isbn=0-89207-108-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is regarded, along with ''Takka Takka'' as "successful in their combination of brilliant color and narrative situation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|author=Alloway, Lawrence|isbn=0-89659-331-2|publisher=[[Abbeville Press]]|date=1983|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blam'' is a jest with the viewer that uses an exclamation without narrative context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gardner's Art Through The Ages|edition=tenth|publisher=[[Harcourt Brace College Publishers]]|author=Tansey, Richard G. and Fred S. Kleiner|page=1116|isbn=0-15-501141-3|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Blang'' (1962) and ''Varoom'' (1963), ''Blam'''s [[onomatopoeia]] explodes "like a violent central sun over the entire composition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lichtenstein|editor=Boatto, Alberto and Giordano Falzoni|edition=International|publisher=Fantazaria|page=56|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein has revised the original source so that the aircraft and its explosion are the joint foci from which the painting radiates. Unlike the original, which had substantive narrative content, Lichtenstein's version has more formality and a linear pattern, but a more simplified surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Pop Art|author=Alloway, Lawrence|date=1974|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc.]]|isbn=0-02-627700-X|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Carabinieri Command for the Protection of Cultural Heritage''''', better known as the '''Carabinieri T.P.C.''', is the branch of the Italian Carabinieri responsible for combatting art and antiquities crimes.&lt;ref name="Introduzione"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sm8tn |title=The Carabinieri Art Quad |publisher=BBC |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Il Nucleo Tutela Patrimonio Artistico'' was founded by General Arnaldo Ferrara on 3 May 1969. It was the first specialist police force in the world in this sector, predating the [[UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property]] of 1970. On 5 March 1992 the force was renamed ''Comando Carabinieri per la Tutela del Patrimonio Culturale''.&lt;ref name="Introduzione"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Cittadino/Informazioni/Tutela/Patrimonio+Culturale/default.htm |title=Comando Carabinieri Tutela Patrimonio Culturale - Introduzione |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministero della Difesa]] |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The force has four sections: archaeology, antique dealing, fakes, and contemporary art. It is led by a colonel and headquartered in Rome, with twelve regional offices. It functions in coordination with the ''[[Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali]]''.&lt;ref name="Introduzione"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Articolazione"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Cittadino/Informazioni/Tutela/Patrimonio+Culturale/02_TPC.htm |title=Comando Carabinieri Tutela Patrimonio Culturale - Articolazione |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministero della Difesa]] |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The force investigates clandestine excavations, the theft and illicit trade in works of art, damage to monuments and archaeological zones, the illegal export of cultural property, and fakes. It is involved in the monitoring and control of archaeological sites, and the activities of art and antique dealers, junk shops, and restorers. The force is also involved in forensic analysis; the development and promotion of educational materials; advising overseas ministries, police forces and customs bodies; international peacekeeping missions; and the protection and recovery of cultural property in disaster zones.&lt;ref name="Compiti"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Cittadino/Informazioni/Tutela/Patrimonio+Culturale/03_TPC.htm |title=Comando Carabinieri Tutela Patrimonio Culturale - Compiti |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministero della Difesa]] |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partners==
The force works internationally with organisations including [[UNESCO]], [[UNIDROIT]], [[ICOMOS]], [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]], and [[INTERPOL]].

==Results==
In 2009 some 39,584 looted antiquities and 19,043 other works were recovered, valued at €165 million. In 2008 works valued at €183 million were recovered. Improved international collaboration, site security, and databases saw a drop of 14.5% in stolen Italian works between the two years, while the number of illegal archaeological excavations discovered fell from 238 in 2008 to 58 in 2009.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=35634 |title=Italian Authorities Recover Euro165 Million in Stolen Art, Relics |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 137 items relating to the [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Medici case]] were returned from Switzerland, recovered from the Zurich-based restorers Fritz Burki &amp; Son, who had worked on the [[Euphronios krater]].

'''''Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc.''''' 861 F. Supp. 303 ([[S.D.N.Y.]] 1994), ''rev'd'' 71 F.3d 77 ([[2d Cir.]] 1995), ''[[Certiorari|cert.]] denied'' 116 S. Ct. 1824 (1996). 

==Overview==
This an early case of authors attempting to exercise their moral rights under the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]] (VARA). VARA was passed in 1990 and added several [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] for artists in the U.S., including the right of authors to prevent mutilation of their works.

==Facts==
The Plaintiffs John Carter, John Swing, and John Veronis (artists) created art and sculpture work together in [[New York City]] under the name "Jx3". 474431 Associates was the owner of a former [[Macy's]] warehouse at 47-44 31st Street, in the [[Long Island City]] section of Queens, New York. 474431 Associates leased this building to 47-44 31st Street Associates, L.P. and from February 1, 1990 to June, 1993, SIG Management Company ["SIG"] managed the property as "The Factory Building" and marketed it as a mall.

On December 16, 1991, the artists entered into a contract with SIG "to design, create and install sculpture and other permanent installations" in the building. The artists had "full authority in design, color, and style" of the artwork they installed. The artists created multiple ecological themed sculptures along with a mosaic on the floor made of recycled light bulbs. SIG could direct the location and installation of the artwork within the building. SIG agreed to pay the artists one thousand dollars a week for at least forty hours of work. The artists retained copyright in their work, but SIG was to receive 50% of all proceeds from the exploitation of the art.

On March 31, 1994, Helmsley-Spear, Inc. assumed the management of the property. Helmsley-Spear's representatives forbade the artists from installing any further artwork, and stated that they were going to remove the completed art from the building. The artists believed that this was a mutilation of their artwork under [[Visual Artists Rights Act]] and filed a lawsuit to enjoin the defendants from taking such actions.

==District Court==

The District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Second District, granted the artists an injunction under VARA prohibiting removal of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc. |vol=861 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=303 |pinpoint= |court=S.D.N.Y. |date=1994 |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/861/303/2261919/ |accessdate=2017-09-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That decision was appealed to the [[Second Circuit]] Court of Appeals.

==Circuit Court==
The Second Circuit found that the sculpture was a [[work for hire|work made for hire]] and vacated the injunction. In coming to this conclusion, it applied the 13-factor test from ''[[Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid]]'', 490 U.S. 730, for determining if a work is created as a "work made for hire" or if the artist was working as "independent contractor".

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a [[point group]], for every point (x, y, z) in the [[unit cell]] there is an indistinguishable point (-x, -y, -z). Such point groups are also said to have ''inversion'' symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fu|first1=Liang|last2=Kane|first2=C.|title=Topological insulators with inversion symmetry|journal=Physical Review B|volume=76|issue=4|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.76.045302|arxiv = cond-mat/0611341 |bibcode = 2007PhRvB..76d5302F }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Point reflection]] is a similar term used in geometry.
Crystals with an inversion center cannot display certain properties, such as the [[piezoelectric effect]].

The following [[Space group#Table of space groups in 3 dimensions|space groups]] have inversion symmetry: the triclinic space group 2, the monoclinic 10-15, the orthorhombic 47-74, the tetragonal 83-88 and 123-142, the trigonal 147, 148 and 162-167, the hexagonal 175, 176 and 191-194, the cubic 200-206 and 221-230.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cockcroft|first1=Jeremy Karl|title=The 230 3-Dimensional Space Groups|url=http://pd.chem.ucl.ac.uk/pdnn/symm3/allsgp.htm|publisher=Birkbeck College, University of London|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Point groups lacking an inversion center ('''non-centrosymmetric''') can be ''[[Polar point group|polar]]'', ''[[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]]'' , both or neither. 

A ''[[Polar point group|polar]]'' [[point group]] is one whose symmetry operations leave more than one common point unmoved. A polar point group has no unique origin because each of those unmoved points can be chosen as one. The unmoved points collectively make one or more unique anisotropic axes. Polar point groups in crystal include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. 

A ''[[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]]'' (often also called enantiomorphic) [[point group]] is one containing only proper (often called "pure") rotation symmetry. No inversion, reflection, roto-inversion or roto-reflection (i.e., improper rotation) [[symmetry]] exists in such point group. Chiral [[point group]]s in crystal include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, and 432.  [[Chirality (chemistry)|Chiral molecules]] such as [[proteins]] crystallize in chiral [[point group]]s.

Non-centrosymmetric point groups in crystal 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 are both polar and chiral.

Non-centrosymmetric point groups in crystal -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m are neither polar nor chiral. On the other hand, polar and chiral point groups must be non-centrosymmetric.

'''Cleavage''' is the exposed area between a woman’s [[breasts]] lying over the [[Human sternum|sternum]], and refers ''only'' to what is visible with clothing (or dense, nontransparent [[body art]]) that includes a low-cut [[neckline]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Erin ; Nichols, Elizabeth Gackstetter. [https://books.google.com/books?id=VAUmDwAAQBAJ Beauty around the World: A Cultural Encyclopedia]. Santa Barbara, CA: [[ABC-CLIO]], 2017, p. 81, {{ISBN|978-1-61069-944-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, display of cleavage is considered aesthetic or erotic, and may be associated with garments with low necklines that expose or highlight cleavage, such as [[ball gown]]s, [[evening gown]]s, lingerie, and [[swimwear]]. In these cultures women have, throughout history, sought to enhance their [[physical attractiveness]] and femininity, within the context of changing fashions and cultural-specific [[Norm (social)|norms]] of [[modesty]] of the time and place. The methods practised in appropriate contexts have included the accentuation and partial display of breasts, including cleavage. In some cultures any display of cleavage may be culturally [[taboo]] (e.g. ''juyub'' in Islam,) illegal or otherwise socially disapproved.

The [[Anatomical terminology|anatomical term]] for the area that constitutes a cleavage is [[intermammary cleft]], intermammary sulcus or sulcus intermammarius.

[[Décolletage]] is the upper part of a woman's torso, between her waist and neck, comprising her neck, shoulders, back and chest, that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing. However, the term is most commonly applied to a neckline that reveals or emphasizes cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Barnhart|editor1-first=Robert K.|title=Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-270084-1|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the side of the breasts are uncovered, it is known as "side cleavage", "sidewinders" or "sideboob".&lt;ref name="Dun"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunlap|first1=Elizabeth|title=The glossary: can't pronounce the ingredient, the makeup artist's name, or even the product?

Gabriele Hackworthy, fashion director at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', said, "The look is unlikely to fade fast, with [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]] and [[Roberto Cavalli]] both pushing the silhouette next season."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Imogen|first1=Fox|title=The side cleavage: a new trend is born|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2012/may/29/side-cleavage-new-trend-born|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff writer|title=Trend Watch: The Side Cleavage|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-style/news/trend-watch-the-side-cleavage-2011276|website=Us Weekly|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lower part of the breasts is uncovered, it is called "underboob".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/16/thailand-warns-underboob-trend-breaks-computer-laws|title=Thailand warns women who post 'underboob' photos face five years in jail|last=Reuters|date=2015-03-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-style/news/kylie-jenner-works-underboob-in-skintight-jumpsuit-photos-w208727|title=Kylie Jenner's Underboob Is Out of Control in This Jumpsuit|work=Us Weekly|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Dress code|Breast fetishism}}

Many people in [[Western culture]], both male and female, consider breasts an important female [[secondary sex characteristic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html |title=Secondary Characteristics |work=hu-berlin.de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927075821/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an important aspect of femininity. [[Décolletage]] that exposes cleavage is used by many women to enhance their [[physical attractiveness|physical]] and [[sexual attractiveness]] and to improve their sense of femininity. Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine [[flirting]] or [[seduction]], as much as for its aesthetic or erotic effect. Most men derive [[erotic pleasure]] from seeing a woman's cleavage,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, Alfred C.]] et al. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]''.

When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or exposed by a low neckline it can draw attention.&lt;ref name="scoop"&gt;Dr. Ted Eisenberg and Joyce K.

Displaying cleavage or any part of female breast may be considered inappropriate or even prohibited by [[dress code]]s in some settings, such as workplaces, churches, and schools, while in some spaces showing as much cleavage as possible can be permissible or even encouraged. The exposure of [[nipple]]s or [[areolae]] is almost always considered immodest and in some instances is viewed as [[lewd]] or [[indecent exposure|indecent]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;D.

=== Theories ===
{{See also|Evolutionary psychology}}

The cleavage area between the breasts is perhaps the epicentre and stimulation of interest{{Clarify|reason=interest in what?|date=November 2018}}. Breast and [[buttock cleavage]]s, sharing a similarity between their appearances, are considered sexual in some cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Asa Berger, ''Media and Society: A Critical Perspective'', page 194, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4422-1780-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; British [[zoologist]] and [[ethologist]] [[Desmond Morris]] theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks.&lt;ref&gt;Morris (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; Swelling of the anterior is a sign of mating-readiness in ape species. Among humans the female genitalia is regressed and the upright posture reduces visibility of the buttocks, but the breasts are significantly enlarged. Theorists{{Who|date=November 2018}} hypothesize that with these evolutionary changes, the measure of mating-readiness and attractiveness in females has shifted from swagging buttocks to the pendulous shape of breasts and cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Curtis, ''Steal This Book Too!'', page 287, Authorhouse, May 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-4184-1875-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] theorize that humans' permanently enlarged breasts, in contrast to other primates' breasts, which only enlarge during [[ovulation]], allowed females to "solicit male attention and investment even when they are not really fertile",&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Charles B. and Krebs, Dennis (eds.) "How Mate Choice Shaped Human Nature", ''Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology: Ideas, Issues, and Applications'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; though Morris notes that in recent years there has been a trend toward reversing breast augmentations.&lt;ref&gt;Morris (1997) pp. 236,240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris (2004), pp. 156-159&lt;/ref&gt; According to social historian David Kunzle, waist confinement and décolletage are the primary [[sexualization]] devices of Western costume.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, Jennifer. ''The Face of Fashion'', page 122, Routledge, 1993, {{ISBN|0-203-40942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the 21st century, some of the attention given to cleavage and breasts started to shift to buttocks, especially in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Boye De Mente, ''The Origins of Human Violence'', page 61, Cultural-Insight Books, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-4528-5846-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antiquity ===
In 2600 BCE, princess [[Nofret]] of the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt]] was depicted in a V-neck gown with a plunging neckline that exposed ample cleavage. In 1600 BCE, [[Snake Goddess]] figurines were sculpted in [[Minos]] with open dress-fronts, revealing entire breasts.&lt;ref name=olson&gt;James S.

Décolletage was often a feature of the dress of the late Middle Ages. This continued through the [[Victorian period]]. Gowns that exposed a woman's neck and top of her chest were very common and uncontroversial in Europe from at least the 11th century until the Victorian period in the 19th century. Ball or evening gowns especially featured low square décolletage designed to display and emphasize cleavage.&lt;ref name="Gernsheimpp"&gt;Gernsheim, Alison. ''Victorian and Edwardian Fashion.

In the 14th century, necklines were lowered, clothes were tightened and breasts were once again flaunted. In 1450, [[Agnès Sorel]], mistress to [[Charles VII of France]], is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with [[toplessness|fully bared breasts]] in the French court.&lt;ref name="histoire_mode"&gt;Monique Canellas-Zimmer, ''Histoires de mode'', Les Dossiers d'Aquitaine – 2005, {{ISBN|9782846221191}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed included [[Simonetta Vespucci]], whose [[Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci (Piero di Cosimo)|portrait with exposed breasts]] was painted by [[Piero di Cosimo]] in c.1480.

In many European societies between the Renaissance and the 19th century, wearing low-cut dresses that exposed breasts was more acceptable than today; with a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders being considered to be more risqué than exposed breasts.&lt;ref&gt;Cunnington, C.

During the 16th century, women's fashions with exposed breasts were common in society, from queens to common prostitutes, and emulated by all classes. [[Anne of Brittany]] has also been painted wearing a dress with a square neckline. Low square décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] and [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], wife of [[Charles I of England]], were depicted with fully bared breasts; and architect [[Inigo Jones]] designed a [[masque]] costume for Henrietta Maria that fully revealed both of her breasts.&lt;ref name="Nigel Llewellyn 1660" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsandevents.warwick.ac.uk/index.cfm?page=pressrelease&amp;id=1858 |title=Historian Reveals Janet Jackson's 'Accidental' Exposing of Her Breast was the Height of Fashion in the 1600s|date=5 May 2004|publisher=University of Warwick |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040803155530/http://www.newsandevents.warwick.ac.uk/index.cfm?page=pressrelease&amp;id=1858 |archivedate = 3 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1795–1820 in fashion|fashions of the period 1795–1820]], many women wore dresses that bared necks, bosoms and shoulders. [[Anne of Austria]] was known for wearing, along with female members of her court, very tight [[bodice]] and [[corset]]s that forced breasts together to make deeper cleavages, very low necklines that exposed breasts visible almost in entirety above the [[areola]] and pendants lying on the cleavage to highlight it.&lt;ref name=olson /&gt;

=== Modern period ===
[[Image:Sargent MadameX.jpeg|thumb|This portrait by [[John Singer Sargent]] of [[Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau]] depicting her cleavage caused considerable controversy when it was displayed at the 1884 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] art exhibition in Paris.]]

During the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] period, social attitudes required women to cover their bosom in public. For ordinary wear, high collars were the norm. Towards the end of the Victorian period (end 19th century) the full collar was the fashion, though some décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions (see [[1880s in fashion]]).

During the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], there was a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift to be offered from mother to child. In [[Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy]]'s 1771 play ''The True Mother'' (''La Vraie Mère''), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: "Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts – the respectable treasures of nature – as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Schama, Simon]]. ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', p. 147. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1989. {{ISBN|0-394-55948-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a century later, also in France, a man from the provinces who attended a Court ball at the [[Tuileries]] in [[Paris]] in 1855 was deeply shocked by the décolleté dresses and is said to have exclaimed in disgust: "I haven't seen anything like that since I was weaned!"&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884 ''[[Portrait of Madame X]]'', a portrait painting by [[John Singer Sargent]] of American-born Paris socialite, [[Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau]], was criticized&lt;ref name="Elaine Kilmurray 1998, p. 114"&gt;Richard Ormand and Elaine Kilmurray, ''Sargent: The Early Portraits'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998, p. 114, {{ISBN|0-300-07245-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for depicting her in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and her right shoulder strap fallen off her shoulder. The controversy was so great that he reworked the painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder, and Sargent left Paris for London in 1884.&lt;ref name="Fairbrother 2001 139, Note 4"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fairbrother |first=Trevor |title=John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist |year=2001 |isbn= 978-0-300-08744-4 |page=139, Note 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=g&amp;p=a&amp;a=i&amp;ID=424 "Sargent's Portraits"], an article including a mention of the scandal caused by the portrayal of cleavage in [[John Singer Sargent]]'s "[[Portrait of Madame X]]".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, a single pad made of rubber or a "bust form" was advertised that was to be worn inside the front of the bodice to make cleavage virtually undetectable.&lt;ref&gt;Sherrie A. Inness, ''Delinquents and Debutantes: Twentieth-century American Girls' Cultures'', page 117, New York University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-8147-3765-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clergymen all over the world became shocked when dresses to be worn with modest round or V-shaped necklines became fashionable around 1913. In the [[German Empire]], for example, all [[Roman Catholic]] bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking the new fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage, while exposure of the leg became more accepted in Western societies during [[World War I]] and remained so for nearly half a century.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Kim K. P.; Torntore, Susan J. and Eicher, Joanne Bubolz. ''Fashion foundations'', p. 716, Berg Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85973-619-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century===
In 1953, Hollywood film ''[[The French Line]]'' was found objectionable under the [[Hays Code]] because of [[Jane Russell]]'s "breast shots in bathtub, cleavage and breast exposure" while some of her décollete gowns were thought "...intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme decolletage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doherty|first=Thomas|title=Hollywood's Censor: Joseph I. Breen and the Production Code Administration|year=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-14358-5|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But other actresses defied the then standards. For example, [[Gina Lollobrigida]] raised eyebrows with her famous low-cut dress in 1960, and other celebrities, performers and models followed suit, and the public was not far behind. Low-cut styles of various depths are now common in many situations. During the 1950s, Hollywood and the fashion industry successfully promoted large cloven bustlines (and [[falsies]]). In the late 1960s, erogenous attention began to shift from the large bust to the trim lower torso, reasserting the need to diet, especially as new clothing fashions — brief, sheer, and close fitting — prohibited heavy reliance on foundation lingerie. Legs were relatively less emphasized as elements of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Mazur, "U.S. trends in feminine beauty and overadaptation", ''Journal of Sex Research'', pp. 281-303, Volume 22, Issue 3, 1986, The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, Pennsylvania, USA. DOI: 10.1080/00224498609551309&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1960s onward, however, changes in fashions were towards increasing displays of cleavage in films and television, with Jane Russell and [[Elizabeth Taylor]] being the biggest stars who led the fashion,&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Baker, ''Fashions of a Decade'', page 51, Infobase Publishing, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-4381-1891-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in everyday life low-cut dress styles became very common, even for casual wear.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Koestenbaum, ''Cleavage: essays on sex, stars, and aesthetics'', page 125, Ballantine Books, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-345-43460-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wonderbra was created in 1964 by Louise Poirier for Canadelle, a Canadian lingerie company. It had 54 design elements that lift and support the bustline while creating a deep plunge and push-together effect.

The ideal of breasts and cleavage has also evolved in the later half of the 20th century, with shapes enhanced by use of a variety of [[#Cleavage enhancement|methods and techniques]]. In the 1950s the preferred shape was pointy, echoing the [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] look of the times; in the 1960s it was elegantly sloped in alignment with [[Hippie chic]] of the times; and from the 1990s a buffed, pumped and engorged look has become the preference.&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Gill, ''To America with Love'', page 113, Simon and Schuster, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-4165-9621-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

21st century women's fashions, especially at formal occasions, has increasingly included low-cut dress designs which expose cleavage. Such dress designs have been most noticeable at various awards presentations, such as those seen at the 2016 [[Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-style/red-carpet/it-was-all-about-cleavage-on-the-oscars-red-carpet-this-year/news-story/3e8b2386e2b8a2474f07963b25f589f5 |title=It was all about cleavage on the Oscars red carpet this year |publisher=News.com.au |date=2016-03-01 |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Zoe |url=http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/news/features/2016/02/cleavage-controversy-at-the-sag-awards |title=Susan Sarandon and Sarah Silverman's cleavage cause controversy at the SAG awards |work=Glamour |location=UK |date=2016-02-06 |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such low-cut dresses still attract comment, though less controversy. It was also noticeable in the 2013 film ''[[American Hustle]]'', as well as in films which expose cleavage in a low-cut bra or swimsuit.

Display of cleavage can still be controversial. In the United States, in two separate incidents in 2007, [[Southwest Airlines]] crews asked travelers to modify their clothing, to wear sweaters or to leave the airplane because the crew did not consider the amount of cleavage displayed acceptable.&lt;ref name="Woman told she was too Hot to Fly"&gt;NBC News.

== Cleavage enhancement ==
{{Main|Cleavage enhancement}}
Various methods have been used by women in history to enhance their [[physical attractiveness]] and femininity including the accentuation and display of breasts within the context of fashions and norms of modesty of the time and place.

[[Corset]]s that enhanced cleavage were introduced in the mid-16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Condra, Jill. ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through World History,'' page 152, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, {{ISBN|0-313-33664-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 18th century, cleavage-enhancing corsets grew more dramatic in pushing the breasts upward.&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Catherine. ''Fashioning Gothic Bodies,'' page 28, Manchester University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7190-6401-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tight lacing of corsets worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries emphasized both cleavage and the size of the bust and hips. Especially evening or ball gowns were designed to display and emphasize the décolletage.&lt;ref name="Gernsheimpp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesmondMorris"/&gt;

When corsets became unfashionable, [[brassiere]]s and padding helped to project, display and emphasize the breasts. In 1893, New Yorker Marie Tucek was granted a patent for a "breast supporter," described as a modification of the corset, and was very similar to a modern [[push-up bra]] designed to support the breasts. It consisted of a plate made of metal, cardboard or other stiff material shaped to fit against the torso under the breasts, following the contour of the breasts. It was covered with silk, canvas or other cloth, which extended above the plate to form a pocket for each breast. The plate curved around the torso and ended near the armpits.&lt;ref name="Tucek"&gt;{{cite news |last=Riordan |first=Teresa |title=Patents; In bra technology, an incremental improvement can translate into comfort |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/28/business/patents-in-bra-technology-an-incremental-improvement-can-translate-into-comfort.html?sec=technology&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=2009-04-21 |date=2002-10-28 |publisher=The New York Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gHMwNkFs?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/28/business/patents-in-bra-technology-an-incremental-improvement-can-translate-into-comfort.html?sec=technology&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate=2009-04-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference | number = 494397  | y = 1893 | m = 03 | d = 28 | inventor = Marie Tucek | title = Breast Supporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the underwire bra started in the 1930s,&lt;ref name="Napoleon"&gt;{{cite book | last = Napoleon | first = Anthony | title = Awakening Beauty: An Illustrated Look at Mankind's Love and Hatred of Beauty | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AyJLqNcfM3IC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=history+underwire+bra | accessdate = 2009-04-21 | edition = Illustrated | year = 2003 | publisher = Virtual Bookworm Publishing | isbn  = 978-1-58939-378-3 | pages = 31, 130–131 | chapter = Wardrobe}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it did not gain widespread popularity until the 1950s, when the end of [[World War II]] freed metal for domestic use.&lt;ref name="Kanner"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kanner | first = Bernice | title = The Bra's not for Burning | journal = [[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]] | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KdgBAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA29&amp;dq=history+underwire+bra+1938 | accessdate = 2009-04-21 | volume = 16 | issue = 49 | date = 1983-12-12 | issn = 0028-7369 | pages = 26–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seigel"&gt;{{cite news | last = Seigel | first = Jessica | title = The Cups Runneth Over | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/13/opinion/the-cups-runneth-over.html?pagewanted=all | accessdate = 2013-05-09 | date = 2004-02-13 | publisher = ''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aviator and filmmaker [[Howard Hughes]] designed a prototype for an aerodynamic underwire bra for [[Jane Russell]] when filming ''[[The Outlaw]]'' in 1941. According to Hughes, the resultant amount was "the length of the actual cleavage is five and one-quarter inches."&lt;ref name=divide /&gt; Several brassiere manufacturers, among them [[Wonderbra]] and [[Victoria's Secret]], produce push-up and other types of bras that enhance cleavage. [[Frederick's of Hollywood]] introduced a design called Hollywood Extreme Cleavage Bra that helped give the impression of a spherical cleavage like augmented breasts that was popularized by stars like [[Pamela Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;Jene Luciani, ''The Bra Book'', pp=103, 140, BenBella Books Inc., 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-935251-92-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taping ===
Many women, such as beauty pageant participants and [[transgender]] people, create cleavage by using tape underneath and across their breast, bending forward, tightly pulling them together and up.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Banet-Weiser, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BsZHUu3gmV0C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=breast+cleavage+taping&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9Ys9VLOkI4KVuASCvICYAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=breast%20cleavage%20taping&amp;f=false The Most Beautiful Girl in the World: Beauty Pageants and National Identity],'' page 73, University of California Press, (1999) {{ISBN|978-0-520-21789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apaige&gt;Andy Paige, ''Style on a Shoestring,'' page 24, McGraw Hill Professional, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-07-159506-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;IV2"&gt;JoAnn Roberts, ''Art and Illusion: A Guide to Crossdressing'' (Vol. 2), Creative Design Services, 1994, {{ISBN|1-880715-08-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of tape used include surgical micropore tape and athletic tape. Some also use a strip of [[moleskin]] under the breasts with tape at the ends to hold it in place. Use of the wrong techniques or tape with too strong an adhesive can cause injuries such as rashes, blisters and skin being torn off.&lt;ref name=apaige /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;IV2" /&gt;

=== Surgery ===
{{Main|Breast augmentation}}

Bigger breasts are easier to push together to accent the hollow between them.&lt;ref name="scoop"/&gt; Some flat-chested women feel self-conscious about their small breasts and want to improve their sexual attractiveness by seeking [[breast augmentation]].&lt;ref name=brett&gt;{{cite news|last=Brett|first=Samantha|title=The Great Cleavage Conundrum: should men look if it's on display?|url=http://www.northernargus.com.au/blogs/national-comment/the-great-cleavage-conundrum-should-men-look-if-its-on-display/2459026.aspx?storypage=0|accessdate=17 February 2012|newspaper=Northern Argus|date=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic surgeon Gerard H. Pitman says, "you can't have cleavage with an A cup. You have to be at least a B or a C."&lt;ref name=divide /&gt; A similar statement was made for non-surgical cleavage enhancement as well (i.e. lingerie manufacturers [[Frederick's of Hollywood]] promises "high-rise cleavage to small busts" and Curvees in Etam claims to give girls with a B cup an "exciting C cup cleavage").&lt;ref name=anxiety&gt;Kristina Roberts Ellis, ''Bodies of Thought, Sites of Anxiety'', pages 82-83, ProQuest, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-549-98382-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast surgery for emplacing [[breast implant]]s can be done for three purposes:

# primary reconstruction to replace breast tissues damaged by [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] ([[blunt trauma|blunt]], [[penetrating trauma|penetrating]], [[blast injury|blast]]), disease (breast cancer) and failed anatomic development ([[tuberous breast]] deformity).
# revision and reconstruction to revise (correct) the outcome of a previous breast reconstruction surgery.
# primary augmentation to aesthetically augment the size, form and feel of the [[breast]]s.

For [[breast reconstruction]] and for the augmentation and enhancement of the aesthetics — size, shape, and texture — of a woman's breasts, there are two types of breast implant devices in practice: saline implants filled with sterile [[saline (medicine)|saline solution]] and silicone implants filled with viscous [[silicone]] gel.

If a surgeon attempts to create or increase cleavage by loosening the medial borders of the breasts, it could result in [[symmastia]], a confluence of the breast tissue of both breasts across the midline anterior to the [[Human sternum|sternum]], creating a lack of defined cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;Iliana E. Sweis, ''Outsmarting Mother Nature,'' page 163, ABC-CLIO, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-313-38614-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procedures are generally followed during [[breast reconstruction]] to preserve a natural cleavage of breasts.&lt;ref&gt;Jay R. Harris, Marc E. Lippman, C. Kent Osborne and Monica Morrow, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GLc8xYe239kC&amp;pg=PT1448&amp;lpg=PT1448&amp;dq=intermammary+succulus+pathology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zb2PvcRnK1&amp;sig=AkGgy-yKvAl3pgJSsUB4nENhuXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iLhVVKfFA8TguQT7s4CYAg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Diseases of the Breast],'' Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4511-4870-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exercise ===
Regular exercise of the muscles and fibres of the pectoral complex, which lies just under the fatty tissues of the breast, helps prevent droopiness and can create the illusion of larger and firmer breasts and an enhanced cleavage.&lt;ref name=bmars&gt;Brigitte Mars, ''Beauty by Nature'', page 136, Book Publishing Company, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-57067-193-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Lydon, ''Look Hot, Live Long'', page 198, Basic Health Publications, Inc., 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-59120-024-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joyce L.

=== Make up ===
Making cleavage appear deeper and the breasts look fuller alongside the cleavage with makeup is achieved using [[shading]] effects. The middle of the cleavage is made to look deeper by using a darker makeup colour than the base colour of the skin, while the most prominent areas of the breasts (either side of the cleavage) are made to look larger or more protruding by the use of a paler colour.&lt;ref&gt;''Art and Illusion: A Guide to Crossdressing'' Third Edition, Vol. 2 – Fashion &amp; Style", JoAnn Roberts, Creative Design Services, 1994, {{ISBN|1-880715-08-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Making Faces", Kevyn Aucoin, Prion Books Limited, 1997, {{ISBN|1-85375-355-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}

The '''''Death of the Virgin''''' acquired in 1944 by the [[Legion of Honor (museum)|Legion of Honor Art Museum]] in [[San Francisco]] is an oil painting on a panel created sometime in the late fifteenth century in [[Swabia]], [[Germany]] by an unknown artist, portraying the [[Virgin Mary]] surrounded by the [[twelve apostles]]. The [[Death of the Virgin|subject]] has been painted by several other anonymous [[Master of the Death of the Virgin (disambiguation)|masters of the Death of the Virgin]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;.

==Art style==
The painting contains many key religious figures, as religious works were the most popular during the Middle Ages. Religious paintings would often be done as works of patronage to a church, especially during the early Middle Ages. Towards the end of the fifteenth century, however, it was common for works of art to include more aspects of secular life and create a more human connection to the painting. The fact that Mary is elderly as she would be at that point in her life is historically accurate.  All apostles are present at the scene of her death, but neither Jesus Christ nor any angels appear in the work. 
 
==Symbols in the work==
The artwork contains a few symbols in it. One of the symbols is the candle which the Virgin Mary can be seen holding. This is often a sign of the fact that Mary is still alive in the work. In other works the candle may be out, signifying she has passed. Around her bed are the twelve apostles, who appear to be in a kind of funerary ritual, as one can be seen reading from a book, another is sprinkling her with water, and another is holding incense. The bed also has a step, making it so that the viewer does not seem to out of complete reach of the Virgin Mary. Mary is also dying in a house or room, which has more in common with a fifteenth century home than a fifth century one. 
 
==The Background of the story==
The Death of the Virgin is inspired by a legend which originated in the fifth century, as it is nowhere to be found in any book from the Bible.  The legend is also known as the [[Dormition of Theotokos]] (“the one who gave birth to God”), and originated mostly likely in the [[Byzantine]] world, working its way westward into Europe.  In the legend, Mary is visited by an angel, sometimes [[Gabriel]], informing her that she will die soon.  She is granted a wish in which she asks to be united with all twelve apostles when she dies.  As such, the apostles are miraculously transported from all over the world to the place where the Virgin Mary is dying.  Those who are dead are also transported, some appearing on clouds.  The artist of the work has chosen to represent this aspect of the story, as all the apostles appear.  However, the author’s choice to be more realistic has led to the fact that no angels are present at the scene.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2981">The '''female epic''' is a concept in [[literary criticism]] that seeks to expand generic boundaries by identifying ways in which women authors have adapted the masculine epic tradition to express their own heroic visions.

Historically, [[Epic poetry|epic]] literature has been considered an exclusively male domain, to the extent that "epic and masculinity appear to be almost coterminous." &lt;ref name="appanglo1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Schweizer | first = Bernard | title = Approaches to the Anglo and American Female Epic, 1621-1982 | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-7546-5486-9 |page =1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] to [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', the epic canon has been defined by works authored by men, and the characteristic subject matter and diction of the epic have carried connotations of masculinity. Recently, however, [[feminist]] literary critics have identified a number of texts written by women which, they argue, deserve to be considered epics, as they have many of the required qualities: emphasis on [[hero]]ism, [[Nation-building|nation building]], religious authority, a strong [[quest]] motif, and significant length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schweizer | first = Bernard | title = Rebecca West: Heroism, Rebellion, and the Female Epic | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-313-32360-7 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these texts post-date Milton's ''Paradise Lost'' &amp;ndash; conventionally considered to be the last authentic epic in the Western tradition &amp;ndash;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fowler | first = Alastair | title =Kinds of Literature: An Introduction to the Theory of Genres and Modes| page = 167 | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they are by default "modern epics".
However, argue these critics, this is by no means a contradiction. The epic remains an authentic and vital literary genre, and one to which women have made valuable contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizer (2006), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The breadth of these studies is indicated by the essays in [[Bernard Schweizer]]'s ''Approaches to the Anglo and American Female Epic, 1621-1982'' (2006), which features studies of, among others, [[Lady Mary Wroth]]’s ''The Countesse of Montgomeries Urania'', [[Mary Tighe]]’s ''Psyche'', [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]’s ''[[Aurora Leigh]]'', [[Sharon Doubiago]]’s ''Hard Country'', and [[Rebecca West]]’s ''[[Black Lamb and Grey Falcon]]''.

'''Figure/Ground''' is an open-source, para-academic, inter-disciplinary website which publishes in-depth interviews with scholars, researchers, and university professors, as well as artists, filmmakers, and creators of every stripe. Figure/Ground was a finalist in 2012 [[Canadian Online Publishing Awards]] and the 2013 [[Edublog Award]]s, and received the 2012 [[New Canadian Weblog Award]] (education category) as well as the 2013 [[John Culkin Award]] for outstanding praxis by the [[Media Ecology Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards|url=http://figureground.org/support-us/|website=Figure/Ground|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Figure/Ground began as a personal blog founded by [[Laureano Ralón]] in 2009. It claims to contain one of the largest collections of scholarly interviews on the web, with numerous volunteer collaborators ranging from senior undergraduates to PhD candidates. 

==Mission==
According to the About page in the website: 

Figure/Ground sits on the edges of the academy and the art world; our aim is to bring the voices of academics and artists out of their specialized domains of practice and give them a venue for speaking frankly to the public at large.
Conversation is one of the most basic forms of human communication, yet the interview is a deeply undervalued genre within academic discourse. The majority of [[peer-reviewed journal]]s in the humanities and social sciences publish mostly essays and book reviews. In an age of digital interactive media, we believe the interview genre can serve as a powerful pedagogic tool and as a primary source for the production of new knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://figureground.org/about-fg/|website=Figure/Ground|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local TV station [[CHCH]] introduced Canadians to ''[[Smith &amp; Smith]]'', which featured [[Steve Smith (comedian)|Steve]] and [[Morag Smith]] (the former better known from his stint as [[The Red Green Show|Red Green]]). ''[[The Hilarious House of Frightenstein]]'' was a Canadian children's television series which was also produced by [[CHCH]] in 1971. It was syndicated to television stations across Canada and the [[United States]], and occasionally still appears today in some TV markets.

==Film studios==
January 2014 saw the official opening of a new 4000 sq ft film, TV and web series production studio delivering a full service option for the independent filmmaker. Operated by Digital Canaries as one of its 2 Hamilton locations [http://www.digitalcanaries.com/studio ]  and located at 270 Sherman Ave North.  In July 2015, Digital Canaries Studios moved to 520 Burlington St. E., a 66,000 sq ft facility of studio spaces, standing sets, green screens, props and wardrobe department.

In March 2008, a brand new [[film studio]] opened up on 525 [[Parkdale Avenue (Hamilton, Ontario)|Parkdale Avenue North]] called, ''Steel Work Studios''. It was supposed to be a full service film studio with 13 departments to meet the needs of the TV and film industry which included a talent agency for Extra's and talent called, 'Cast In Steel.'.&lt;ref name=STEELWORKS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://steelworkstudios.com/ |title= STEEL WORK STUDIOS- 525 Parkdale Avenue North |accessdate=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group involved with Steel Work Studios were very optimistic about the studio noting that in 2007 [[TV]] and film was a $1-billion industry in Ontario and 40% of that was in Hamilton, Ontario.&lt;ref name=STEELWORKS2&gt;{{cite web|url= http://thespec.com/article/341720|title= (www.thespec.com) Hollywood dreams on Parkdale North - New studio aims at share of $1 billion Ontario business (March 2008) |accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later the facility closed down and no official word was given for its closure.

In recent years there has been talk of converting the {{convert|500000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility on [[Victoria Avenue (Hamilton, Ontario)|Victoria Avenue North]] that was one time home of the [[Otis Elevator Company]] and [[Studebaker]] plant into a Mega-Film Studio. In 2004 a group of local [[investors]] were ready to open up the $30-million facility named ''Hamilton Film Studios'' but pulled out two months after it opened up. One of the main reasons was they overestimated the appeal of the site, in that the interior had too many support beams, making the space impractical for productions requiring wide, uninterrupted expanses.&lt;ref name=HAMFILMS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbackonline.ca/articles/magazine/20040621/studio.html |title= (www.playbackonline.ca) Hamilton studio closes doors (June 2004) |accessdate=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the NUVO Network opened its 150,000 square foot facility consisting of 
three state-of-the-art media production studios, podcasting facilities, recording and vlogging studios, alongside editing suites, office spaces, and events venue. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.wireservice.ca/index.php?module=News&amp;func=display&amp;sid=23992&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6346">'''George Sheringham''' (13 November 1884 – 11 November 1937), was a British painter and theatre designer. One of the first recipients of the [[Royal Designers for Industry]] distinction in 1937, he is remembered for his work for the [[D’Oyly Carte Opera Company]].

==Life and career==
Sheringham was born in London, the son of an [[Anglican]] clergyman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=SHERINGHAM, Rev. Harry Alsager|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=1598|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1598}} Rev. Sheringham was the father of George and Hugh, the Angling Editor for [[The Field (magazine)|''The Field'']].&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at the King’s School, [[Gloucester]], the [[Slade School]] of Art (1899–1901), and the [[Sorbonne]], Paris (1904–06).

===Painter and illustrator===
He first exhibited in Paris and later in Venice, Brussels, and Berlin. His one-man exhibitions included one in Paris in 1905, in London at the Ryder Gallery the same year, one in [[Melbourne]], one in New York and seven more in London.&lt;ref name=Who&gt;Who Was Who, A &amp; C Black, London, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; He exhibited with the International Society from 1922.&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999999&amp;artistid=1937&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio Profile from the Tate Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though best known as a stage designer and decorative artist, Sheringham also illustrated books by [[Max Beerbohm]] (including ''[[The Happy Hypocrite]]'' (1915)) and [[Edmond Rostand]] (''La Princesse Lointaine'', 1919).&lt;ref&gt;[http://livre-rare-book.com/cgi-bin/lrbcgi?RB=BOOK&amp;rf=25047lrbCHA-6805 Information about the illustrations for ''La Princesse Lointaine'', 1919]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1917, he illustrated ''Canadian Wonder Tales'' by Cyrus MacMillan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=macmillan&amp;book=wonder&amp;story=_front&amp;PHPSESSID=2a79e0a17f6bf990f295a65a29d0e5d3 ''Canadian Wonder Tales'', 1917]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1921, he collaborated with his brother Hugh on a book about fishing, ''The Book of the Fly Rod''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alibris.com/booksearch?qwork=768312&amp;matches=29&amp;author=Sheringham%2C+George&amp;browse=1&amp;cm_re=works*listing*title ''The Book of the Fly Rod'']  See also ''[[The Times]]'', 12 November 1937&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote ''Drawing in Pen and Pencil'' (1922), with James Laver, ''Design in the Theatre'' (1927).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrisbeetles.com/pictures/artists/Sheringham_George/Sheringham_George.htm Profile at the Chris Beetles website]&lt;/ref&gt; and with Rupert Mason and R.

The '''Gundestrup cauldron''' is a richly decorated [[silversmithery|silver vessel]], thought to date from between 200 BC and 300 AD,&lt;ref name="Nielsen"&gt;Nielsen, S; Andersen, J; Baker, J; Christensen, C; Glastrup, J; et al.

The [[cauldron]] is the largest known example of [[European Iron Age]] silver work (diameter: {{convert|69|cm|in|abbr=on}};  height: {{convert|42|cm|in|abbr=on}}). It was found dismantled, with the other pieces stacked inside the base, in 1891 in a [[peat bog]] near the hamlet of Gundestrup in the [[Aars]] parish of [[Himmerland]], [[Denmark]] ({{coord|56|49|N|9|33|E|}}).&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"&gt;Bergquist, A K &amp; Taylor, T F (1987), “The origin of the Gundestrup cauldron”, ''Antiquity 61'': 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, Timothy (1992), “The Gundestrup cauldron”, ''Scientific American, 266'': 84-89. {{ISSN|0036-8733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"&gt;Olmsted, Garrett S (1979), “The Gundestrup cauldron : its archaeological context, the style and iconography of its portrayed motifs and their narration of a Gaulish version of Táin Bó Cúailnge”, ''Collection Latomus 162'' [Latomus: Bruxelle 1979]. {{ISBN|2-87031-102-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now usually on display in the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]], with replicas at other museums; during 2015-16 it was in the UK on a travelling exhibition called ''The Celts''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland/whats-on/celts/ Exhibition page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112064611/http://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland/whats-on/celts |date=2016-01-12 }}, [[National Museum of Scotland]], 10 Mar - 25 Sep 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cauldron is not complete, and now consists of a rounded cup-shaped bottom making up the lower part of the cauldron, usually called the base plate, above which are five interior plates and seven exterior ones; a missing eighth exterior plate would be needed to encircle the cauldron, and only two sections of a rounded rim at the top of the cauldron survive.  The base plate is mostly smooth and undecorated inside and out, apart from a decorated round medallion in the centre of the interior. All the other plates are heavily decorated with [[repoussé]] work, hammered from beneath to push out the silver.  Other techniques were used to add detail, and there is extensive [[gilding]] and some use of [[inlay|inlaid]] pieces of glass for the eyes of figures.  Other pieces of fittings were found.  Altogether the weight is just under 9 kilograms.&lt;ref&gt;Koch; NMD&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the fact that the vessel was found in Denmark, it was probably not made there or nearby; it includes elements of [[Gaul]]ish and [[Thrace|Thracian]] origin in  the workmanship, [[metallurgy]], and imagery. The techniques and elements of the style of the panels relate closely to other Thracian silver, while much of the depiction, in particular of the human figures, relates to the [[Celts]], though attempts to relate the scenes closely to [[Celtic mythology]] remain controversial.  Other aspects of the [[iconography]] derive from the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;NMD; Green, 45, Sandars, 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Hospitality on a large scale was probably an obligation for Celtic elites, and although cauldrons were therefore an important item of prestige metalwork, they are usually much plainer and smaller than this.  This is an exceptionally large and elaborate object with no close parallel, except a large fragment from a bronze cauldron also found in Denmark, at [[Rynkeby]];&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 252; Megaws, 174-175; Laings, 85, and 68-69 on the even larger, but very fragmentary, Brå cauldron&lt;/ref&gt; however the exceptional [[wetland deposits in Scandinavia]] have produced a number of objects of types that were probably once common but where other examples have not survived.  It has been much discussed by scholars, and represents a fascinatingly complex demonstration of the many cross-currents in European art, as well as an unusual degree of narrative for [[Celtic art]],&lt;ref&gt;Green, 84&lt;/ref&gt; though we are unlikely ever to fully understand its original meanings.

==Discovery==
[[File:ChaudronDeGundestrup6.jpg|thumb|The central medallion of the base plate, from a replica]]
The Gundestrup cauldron was discovered by peat cutters in a small peat bog called Rævemose (near the larger [[Borremose]] bog) on 28 May 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=Iconography+of+cernunnos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p1RDghDrVJ&amp;sig=fwnvbv0_tjE5JR3O_T585-CZ5E8&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Gundestrup%20cauldron&amp;f=false|title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia. Vol. 1-|last=Koch|first=John T.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781851094400|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish government paid a large reward to the finders, who subsequently quarreled bitterly amongst themselves over its division.&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; Palaeobotanical investigations of the peat bog at the time of the discovery showed that the land had been dry when the cauldron was deposited, and the peat gradually grew over it. The manner of stacking suggested an attempt to make the cauldron inconspicuous and well-hidden.&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt; Another investigation of Rævemose was undertaken in 2002, concluding that the peat bog may have existed when the cauldron was buried.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;

The cauldron was found in a dismantled state with five long rectangular plates, seven short plates, one round plate (normally termed the "base plate"), and two fragments of tubing stacked inside the curved base.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt; In addition, there is a piece of iron from a ring originally placed inside the silver tubes along the rim of the cauldron.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt; It is assumed that there is a missing eighth plate because the circumference of the seven outer plates is smaller than the circumference of the five inner plates.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

A set of careful full-size replicas have been made. One is in the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in [[Dublin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/kingship-and-sacrifice.aspx National Museum of Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; and several are in France, including the [[Musée gallo-romain de Fourvière]] at Lyon and the [[National Archaeological Museum (France)|Musée d'archéologie nationale]] at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]].

==Reconstruction==
Since the cauldron was found in pieces, it had to be reconstructed. The traditional order of the plates was determined by [[Sophus Müller]], the first of many to analyze the cauldron. His logic uses the positions of the trace [[solder]] located at the rim of the bowl. In two cases, a puncture mark penetrating the inner and outer plates also helps to establish the order.&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt; In its final form, the plates are arranged in an alternation of female-male depictions, assuming the missing eighth plate is of a female.&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt; Not all analysts agree with Müller's ordering, however. Taylor has pointed out that aside from the two cases of puncturing, the order cannot be determined from the solder alignments. His argument is that the plates are not directly adjacent to each other, but are separated by a 2&amp;nbsp;cm gap; thus, the plates in this order cannot be read with certainty as the true narrative, supposing one exists.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

==Metallurgy==
[[File:Gundestrupkarret2.jpg|thumb|Inside panel '''A''' with the famous horned figure]]
[[File:ChaudronDeGundestrup5.jpg|thumb|Inside panel '''D''' with bull-slaying, replica]]
The Gundestrup cauldron is composed almost entirely of silver, but there is also a substantial amount of gold for the gilding, tin for the solder and glass for the figures' eyes. According to experimental evidence, the materials for the vessel were not added at the same time, so the cauldron can be considered as the work of artisans over a span of several hundred years. The quality of the repairs to the cauldron, of which there are many, is inferior to the original craftsmanship.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

Silver was not a common material in Celtic art, and certainly not on this scale. Except sometimes for small pieces of jewellery, gold or bronze were more usual for prestige metalwork.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 45&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the Gundestrup cauldron was created, silver was obtained through [[cupellation]] of lead/silver ores.&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt; By comparing the concentration of [[isotope geochemistry|lead isotopes]] with the silverwork of other cultures, it has been suggested that the silver came from multiple ore deposits, mostly from [[Celt]]ic northern [[France]] and western [[Germany]] in the pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period. The lead isotope studies also indicate that the silver for manufacturing the plates was prepared by repeatedly melting ingots and/or scrap silver. Three to six distinct batches of recycled silver may have been used in making the vessel.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt; Specifically, the circular "base plate" may have originated as a [[phalera (harness)|phalera]], and it is commonly thought to have been positioned in the bottom of the bowl as a late addition, soldered in to repair a hole.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; By an alternative theory, this phalera was not initially part of the bowl, but instead formed part of the decorations of a wooden cover.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

The gold can be sorted into two groups based on purity and separated by the concentration of silver and copper. The less pure [[gilding]], which is thicker, can be considered a later repair, as the thinner, purer inlay adheres better to the silver. The adherence of the overall gold is quite poor. The lack of mercury from the gold analysis suggests that a fire-gilding technique was not used on the Gundestrup cauldron. The gilding appears to have instead been made by mechanical means, which  explains the function of closely spaced punch marks on the gilded areas.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;

An examination of lead isotopes similar to the one used on the silver was employed for the tin. All of the samples of tin soldering are consistent in lead-isotope composition with ingots from [[Cornwall]] in western [[Great Britain|Britain]]. The tin used for soldering the plates and bowl together, as well as the glass eyes, is very uniform in its high purity.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;

Finally, the glass inlays of the Gundestrup cauldron have been determined through the use of [[X-ray fluorescence|X-ray fluorescence radiation]] to be of a soda-lime type composition. The glass contained elements that can be attributed to calcareous sand and mineral soda, typical of the east coast of the Mediterranean region. The analyses also narrowed down the production time of the glass to between the second century BC and first century AD.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;

==Flow of raw material==
[[File:Detail of Gundestrup Cauldron.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior plate '''d''']]
The workflow of the manufacturing process consisted of a few steps that required a great amount of skill. Batches of silver were melted in crucibles with the addition of copper for a subtler alloy. The melted silver was cast into flat ingots and hammered into intermediate plates.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt; For the relief work, the sheet-silver was annealed to allow shapes to be beaten into high [[repoussé]]; these rough shapes were then filled with pitch from the back to make them firm enough for further detailing with punches and tracers. The pitch was melted out, areas of pattern were gilded, and the eyes of the larger figures were inlaid with glass. The plates were probably worked in a flat form and later bent into curves to solder them together.&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;

It is generally agreed that the Gundestrup cauldron was the work of multiple silversmiths. Using scanning electron microscopy, Benner Larson has identified 15 different punches used on the plates, falling into three distinct tool sets. No individual plate has marks from more than one of these groups, and this fits with previous attempts at stylistic attribution, which identify at least three different silversmiths.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; Multiple artisans would also explain the highly variable purity and thickness of the silver.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:ChaudronDeGundestrup4.jpg|thumb|Interior plate '''B''', replica]]
The silverworking techniques used in the cauldron are unknown from the Celtic world, but are consistent with the renowned Thracian sheet-silver tradition. The scenes depicted are not distinctively Thracian, but certain elements of composition, decorative motifs, and illustrated items (such as the shoelaces on the antlered figure) identify it as Thracian work.&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

Taylor and Bergquist have postulated that the Celtic tribe known as the [[Scordisci]] commissioned the cauldron from native Thracian silversmiths. According to classical historians, the Cimbri, a Teutonic tribe, went south from the lower Elbe region and attacked the Scordisci in 118 BC. After withstanding several defeats at the hands of the Romans, the Cimbri retreated north, possibly taking with them this cauldron to settle in Himmerland, where the vessel was found.&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

Nielsen believes that the question of origin is the wrong one to ask and can produce misleading results. Because of the widespread migration of numerous ethnic groups like the Celts and Teutonic peoples and events like Roman expansion and subsequent Romanization, it is highly unlikely that only one ethnic group was responsible for the development of the Gundestrup cauldron. Instead, the make and art of the cauldron can be thought of as the product of a fusion of cultures, each inspiring and expanding upon one another. In the end, Nielsen concludes that, based on accelerator datings from beeswax found on the back of the plates, the vessel was created within the Roman Iron Age at a location somewhere in Central Europe.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Detail 2 from Gundestrupkarret.jpg|thumb|Exterior plate '''f''', with [[torc]]-wearing head]]
[[File:Gundestrupkedlen- 00054 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Detail from interior plate '''A''']]
[[File:Gundestrup C.jpg|thumb|Interior plate '''C''']]

===Base plate===
The decorated medallion on the circular base plate depicts a bull. Above the back of the bull is a female figure wielding a sword; three dogs are also portrayed, one over the bull's head and another under its hooves.  Presumably all of these figures are in combat; the third dog beneath the bull and near its tail seems to be dead, and is only faintly shown in [[engraving]], and the bull may have been brought down. Below the bull is [[Scroll (art)|scrolling]] ivy that draws from classical Greco-Roman art.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, 175-176; NMD, "The bullfight"&lt;/ref&gt;  The horns of the bull are missing, but there is a hole right through the head where they were originally fitted; they were perhaps gold.  The head of the bull rises entirely clear of the plate, and the medallion is considered the most accomplished part of the cauldron in technical and artistic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 256; Laings, 83; Koch&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exterior plates===
Each of the seven exterior plates centrally depicts a bust. Plates '''a''', '''b''', '''c''', and '''d''' show bearded male figures, and the remaining three are female.

*On plate '''a''', the bearded man holds in each hand a much smaller figure by the arm. Each of those two reach upward toward a small boar. Under the feet of the figures (on the shoulders of the larger man) are a dog on the left side and a winged horse on the right side.
*The figure on plate '''b''' holds in each hand a sea-horse or dragon.
*On plate '''c''', a male figure raises his empty fists. On his right shoulder is a man in a "boxing" position, and on his left shoulder, there is a leaping figure with a small horseman underneath.
*Plate '''d''' shows a bearded figure holding a stag by the hind quarters in each hand.
*The female figure on plate '''e''' is flanked by two smaller male busts.
*A female figure holds a bird in her upraised right hand on plate '''f'''.  Her left arm is horizontal, supporting a man and a dog lying on its back. Two birds of prey are situated on either side of her head. Her hair is being plaited by a small woman on the right.
*On plate '''g''', the female figure has her arms crossed. On her right shoulder, a scene of a man fighting a lion is shown. On her left shoulder is a leaping figure similar to the one on plate '''c'''.

===Interior plates===
*Plate '''A''' shows an antlered male figure seated in a central position, often identified as [[Cernunnos]]. In his right hand, he holds a [[torc]], and with his left hand he grips a horned serpent a little below the head. To the left is a stag with antlers that are very similar to the human/divine figure. Surrounding the scene are other canine, feline, and bovine animals, some but not all facing the human, as well as a human riding a dolphin. Between the antlers of the god is an unknown motif, possibly a plant or a tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=QSuYDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21&amp;lpg=PT21&amp;dq=replicas+of+the+Gundestrup+cauldron+are+found+in+france+and+ireland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lEeVG2t0jo&amp;sig=UFd8L8JWX6LejfCJ8QF67NrbA1g&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=replicas%20of%20the%20Gundestrup%20cauldron%20are%20found%20in%20france%20and%20ireland&amp;f=false|title=The Witch's Cauldron: The Craft, Lore &amp; Magick of Ritual Vessels|last=Zakroff|first=Laura Tempest|date=2017-05-08|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|isbn=9780738752525|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On plate '''B''', the large bust of a torc-wearing female is flanked by two six-[[spoke]]d wheels, what seem to be two elephants, and two griffins. A feline or hound is underneath the bust.
*The large bust of a bearded figure holding on to a broken wheel is at the centre of plate '''C'''. A smaller, leaping figure with a [[horned helmet]] is also holding the rim of the wheel. Under the leaping figure is a horned serpent. The group is surrounded by three [[griffin]]s facing left below, and above, two strange animals who look like [[hyena]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Green, 137&lt;/ref&gt; facing right.  The wheel's spokes are rendered asymmetrically, but judging from the lower half, the wheel may have had twelve spokes.
*Plate '''D''' depicts a bull-slaying scene, with the same composition repeated three times across the plate; the only place where such repetition appears on the cauldron.  Three large bulls are arranged in a row, facing right, and each of them is attacked by a man with a sword. A feline and a dog, both running to the left, appear respectively over and below each bull.
*On the lower half of plate '''E''', a line of [[warrior]]s bearing spears and shields march to the left with, bringing up the rear a warrior with no shield, a sword, and a boar-crested helmet. Behind him are three [[carnyx]] players. In front of this group a dog leaps up, perhaps holding them back.  Behind the dog, at the left side of the scene, a figure over twice the size of the others holds a man upside down, apparently with ease, and apparently is about to immerse him in a barrel or cauldron. On the upper half, warriors on horseback with crested helmets and spears ride away to the right, with at the right a horned serpent, fitted in above the tops of the carnyxes, who is perhaps leading them.  The two lines are below and above what appears to be a tree, still in leaf, lying sideways.  This is now most often interpreted as a scene where fallen warriors are dipped into a cauldron to be reborn into their next life, or afterlife.  This can be paralleled in later [[Welsh literature]].&lt;ref&gt;NMD, "The Gundestrup Cauldron - The Cauldron of Fate?"; Megaws, 176&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, some scholars have interpreted the cauldron's images in terms of the [[Celtic theology|Celtic]] pantheon, and [[Celtic mythology]] as it is presented in much later literature in [[Celtic languages]] from the [[British Isles]].  Others regard the latter interpretations with great suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;Koch; Megaws, 176&lt;/ref&gt; Much less controversially, there are clear parallels between details of the figures and Iron Age Celtic artefacts excavated by archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, 174-176; Koch&lt;/ref&gt;  

Other details of the iconography clearly derive from the art of the [[ancient Near East]], and there are intriguing parallels with ancient India and later [[Hindu]] deities and their stories. Scholars are mostly content to regard the former as motifs borrowed purely for their visual appeal, without carrying over anything much of their original meaning, but despite the distance some have attempted to relate the latter to wider traditions remaining from [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].

===Celtic archaeology===
Among the most specific details that are clearly Celtic are the group of [[carnyx]] players.  The carnyx war horn was known from Roman descriptions of the Celts in battle and [[Trajan's Column]], and a few pieces are known from archaeology, their number greatly increased by finds at [[Tintignac]] in France in 2004. [[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote around 60-30 BC (Histories, 5.30):
:''"Their trumpets again are of a peculiar barbarian kind; they blow into them and produce a harsh sound which suits the tumult of war''"

Another detail that is easily matched to archaeology is the [[torc]] worn by several figures, clearly of the "buffer" type, a fairly common Celtic artefact found in Western Europe, most often France, from the period the cauldron is thought to have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, 174-176; Green, 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Other details with more tentative Celtic links are the long swords carried by some figures, and the horned and antlered helmets or head-dresses and the [[boar]] crest worn on their helmet by some warriors.  These can be related to Celtic artefacts such as a helmet with a [[raptor (bird)|raptor]] crest from [[Romania]], the [[Waterloo Helmet]], [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns]] and various animal figures including boars, of uncertain function.  The shield bosses, spurs and horse harness also relate to Celtic examples.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, 174-177, 160-163; Green, 100-103&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Taranis Jupiter with wheel and thunderbolt Le Chatelet Gourzon Haute Marne.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gallo-Roman]] figure of [[Taranis]]/[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] with his wheel and thunderbolt, and carrying torcs]]
The antlered figure in plate '''A''' has been commonly identified as [[Cernunnos]], who is named (the only source for the name) on the 1st-century [[Gallo-Roman]] [[Pillar of the Boatmen]], where he is shown as an antlered figure with torcs hanging from his antlers.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 78, 135, 137, 147-148, 151&lt;/ref&gt;  Possibly the lost portion below his bust showed him seated cross-legged as the figure on the cauldron is.  Otherwise there is evidence of a [[horned god]] from several cultures. 

The figure holding the broken wheel in plate '''C''' is more tentatively thought to be [[Taranis]], the solar or thunder "wheel-god" named by [[Lucian]] and represented in a number of Iron Age images; there are also many wheels that seem to have been [[amulet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 147-149&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near East and Asia===
The many animals depicted on the cauldron include [[elephant]]s, a [[dolphin]], [[leopard]]-like felines, and various fantastic animals, as well as animals that are widespread across [[Eurasia]], such as snakes, cattle, deer, boars and birds. [[Celtic art]] often includes animals, but not often in fantastic forms with wings and aspects of different animals combined.&lt;ref&gt;Koch; Megaws, 160-163&lt;/ref&gt;  There are exceptions to this, some when motifs are clearly borrowed, as the boy riding a dolphin is borrowed from Greek art, and others that are more native, like the ram-headed horned snake who appears three times on the cauldron.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 135-139&lt;/ref&gt;  The art of [[Thrace]] often shows animals, most often powerful and fierce ones, many of which are also very common in the ancient Near East, or the [[Scythian art]] of the [[Eurasian steppe]], whose mobile owners provided a route for the very rapid transmission of motifs and objects between the civilizations of Asia and Europe.

In particular, the two figures standing in profile flanking the large head on exterior plate F, each with a bird with outstretched wings just above their head clearly resemble a common motif in ancient [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] and [[Persian art]], down to the long garments they wear.  Here the figure is usually the ruler, and the wings belong to a symbolic representation of a deity protecting him. Other plates show [[griffin]]s borrowed from Ancient Greek art of that of the Near East.  On several of the exterior plates the large heads, probably of deities, in the centre of the exterior panels, have small arms and hands, either each grasping an animal or human in a version of the common [[Master of Animals]] motif, or held up empty at the side of the head in a way suggesting inspiration from this motif.

===Celtic mythology===
Apart from Cernunnos and Taranis, discussed above, there is no consensus regarding the other figures, and many scholars reject attempts to tie them in to figures known from much later and geographically distant sources. Some Celticists have explained the elephants depicted on plate '''B''' as a reference to [[Hannibal#Overland journey to Italy|Hannibal's crossing of the Alps]].&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; 

Because of the double-headed wolfish monster attacking the two small figures of fallen men on plate '''b''', parallels can be drawn to the Welsh character [[Manawydan]] or the Irish [[Manannán]], a god of the sea and the Otherworld. Another possibility is the Gaulish version of [[Apollo]], who was not only a warrior, but one associated with springs and healing besides.&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

Olmsted relates the scenes of the cauldron to those of the [[Táin Bó Cuailnge]], where the antlered figure is [[Cú Chulainn]], the bull of the base plate is [[Donn Cuailnge]], and the female and two males of plate '''e''' are [[Medb]], [[Ailill mac Máta|Ailill]], and [[Fergus mac Róich]].  Olmsted also toys with the idea that the female figure flanked by two birds on plate '''f''' could be Medb with her pets or [[Morrígan]], the Irish war goddess who often changes into a carrion bird.&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

Both Olmsted and Taylor agree that the female of plate '''f''' might be [[Rhiannon]] of the [[Mabinogion]]. Rhiannon is famous for her birds, whose songs could "awaken the dead and lull the living to sleep". In this role, Rhiannon could be considered the Goddess of the Otherworld.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

Taylor presents a more pancultural view of the cauldron's images; he concludes that the deities and scenes portrayed on the cauldron are not specific to one culture, but many. He compares Rhiannon, whom he thinks is the figure of plate '''f''', with [[Hariti]], an ogress of [[Bactria]]n mythology. In addition, he points to the similarity between the female figure of plate '''B''' and the [[Hindu]] goddess [[Lakshmi]], whose depictions are often accompanied by elephants. Wheel gods are also cross-cultural with deities like Taranis and [[Vishnu]], a god from Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

[[File:Yuta.jpg|thumb|''Gyotaku'' print of a fish]]
'''''Gyotaku''''' (Japanese 魚拓, from gyo "fish" + taku "stone impression") is the traditional Japanese method of printing fish, a practice which dates back to the mid-1800s.  This form of [[nature printing]] was used by fishermen to record their catches, but has also become an art form of its own.

Gyotaku is a Japanese method of printmaking that traditionally utilizes fish, sea creatures or similar subjects as printing “plates” in its process. The literal translation of the word is “fish stone rubbing”.

Gyotaku, or Japanese fish printing, was originally used to record and  commemorate a fisherman’s catch. Prints were made using Sumi ink and Washi paper. It is rumored that Samurai would settle fishing competitions using Gyotaku prints. This original form of Gyotaku, as a recording method for fisherman, is still utilized today, and can be seen hanging in tackle shops in Japan and Okinawa. 

Eventually it evolved into an art form with three different approaches: 
*Chokusetsu-ho, or the direct style, is the most similar to the original methodology. The fish is cleaned, prepped, supported, and then inked. At this point, dampened Washi (“rice” paper ) is applied to the fish, and an image is created by careful hand rubbing or pressing.

*Kansetsu-ho, or indirect printing, is a more painstaking process, and yields very delicate and detailed images. This method involves adhering Washi Paper, silk, or other fabric to the fish using rice paste. The fish offers the detail of its relief through the silk, and the ink is applied painstakingly to the silk while adhered to the fish, with tampos (applicators made of silk wrapped around cotton).

*Tensha-ho, or transfer Gyotaku, is a lesser known and used technique.  It was developed when the objective of the printing was to create the image on a hard surface such as wood, leather, plastic or even the wall of a dwelling. These are situations when it would be impossible to apply the foundation of the work directly to the surface of the inked subject. In Tensha-ho, the subject is prepared and inked as in the direct method.  Then image is then lifted from the subject after placing and pressing a piece of nylon or polyethylene on the ink covered object. The transfer film is then lifted and carefully placed and pressed upon the target surface. In this method, the final image is not reversed as it is in the Direct method. Through the process, the image is reversed a second time, resulting in a right-oriented impression.

At times  direct prints are left in the black and white state they are printed in, with the eyes painted in afterwards, in gray-scale. This most closely approximates the original form of Gyotaku, the record of the fisherman's catch. Color is usually added to artistic version of these creations, either by using colored inks directly on the fish, or by adding color to the piece afterwards, with transparent washes of inks or color mediums. Finished works can be mounted on scrolls, wet mounted to canvas,  or mounted  to background washi paper, then matted and framed. Frequently, the work includes a red oriental seal, or “chop” and/or some Kanji calligraphy indicating the artist’s name and information, or important subject matter.

Similarly, nature prints evolved in the western world beginning as a functional process and later becoming an art form. In the earliest nature prints, inks or pigments were applied directly to the relief surface of leaves and/or other relatively flat natural subjects in order to capture images of their sizes, shapes, surface textures, and delicate vein or scale patterns. Typically both sides of a leaf were coated with ink and the leaf was then placed inside a folded sheet or between two sheets of paper. When rubbed by hand or run through a [[printing press]] a mirror image was produced of the topside and underside of the same leaf. Often the prints were done in black ink and the flowers later painted or drawn in by the artist. In other cases a flattened, dried leaf or plant was coated once with black ink and then repeatedly printed in a printing press. The initial dark print was used as a work copy or proof print. The subsequent prints, with fainter traces of ink, were hand colored to more closely resemble the appearance of the real subjects.  This methodology is generally applicable to making a print from a fish. They also used wood and carved images into that.

The direct method currently is used throughout the world to record images of a wide diversity of subjects. For example, most western fish printers utilize the direct method but apply colored inks to more closely duplicate the natural colors of their subjects. Unlike prints from plates or blocks in which identical, duplicate images can be created the direct method produces unique, one-of-a-kind prints, and can be editioned like other forms of relief printing.

As a form of art, ''Gyotaku'' is also practiced around the world.

[[File:Joseph Melling-Musée des Arts décoratifs de Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|215px|Self-portrait (date unknown)]]
'''Joseph Melling''' (27 December 1724, [[Saint-Avold]] - 23 December 1796, [[Strasbourg]]) was an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] artist who served as [[court painter]] for the [[Margraviate of Baden]] at [[Karlsruhe Palace]].

== Biography ==
He came from a long-established line of painters, etchers, architects and woodcarvers. His father came to Saint-Avold to participate in the rebuilding of a monastery and its church. He attended the [[Lateinschule]] in [[Saarlouis]] and went to Paris to complete an apprenticeship in carpentry. After that, he studied with [[Carle van Loo]] and [[François Boucher]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{NDB|17|25|26|Melling, Joseph|Rosemarie Stratmann-Döhler|123757630}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1750, he was awarded the [[Prix de Rome]] in painting for his version of [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] giving his daughter to [[Jacob]]. It is not clear if he went to Rome, but it is probable that he did some church painting with his uncle {{ill|Valentin Metzinger|sh}} in Laibach ([[Ljubljana]]).
[[File:Melling Prix de Rome.JPG|thumb|left|185px|Laban Giving his Daughter to Jacob.]]
In 1758, he joined his brother, the sculptor Christoph Melling (1716-1778), as a court painter in Karlsruhe.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; The following year, he married Josepha Lengelacher, the daughter of his brother's supervisor, the sculptor {{ill|Ignác Lengelacher|cs}}. In 1760, he completed a ceiling painting in the large marble hall of the Palace and, in 1764, decorated the altar at the Stadtkirche in [[Rastatt]]. He also served as an advisor to Countess [[Landgravine Caroline Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt|Karoline Luise]], helping her to acquire an art collection that later became the basis of the [[Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

In later years, he travelled throughout the area. In 1769, he painted a ceiling [[fresco]] and altarpieces for the monastery church in [[Friesenheim (Baden-Württemberg)|Schuttern]]. The same year, he did decorations at the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monastery in [[Baden-Baden]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; The year 1770 found him in [[Hechingen]], creating altarpieces for the [[Collegiate church|Stiftskirche]]. Two years later, he was in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]] doing a large mural for the Grand Ducal Palace.
[[File:Karoline Luise von Baden-Durlach.jpg|thumb|275px|Karoline Luise and her sons; Karl Ludwig and Friedrich.]]
For many years, he operated a drawing school in what was once the palace's [[menagerie]]. His daughter Marie Luise (1762–1799) was one of his first students. Later, she took the name "Maria Rosa" and entered [[Lichtenthal Abbey]], where she helped him paint murals in the meeting hall.

In 1774, for financial reasons, he left Karlsruhe for Strasbourg, where he founded an art school; the "Academie de déssin d’après nature".&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; He retained his contacts with the court, however and, after the death of Karoline Luise in 1783, created a catalog and directory of her collection. In 1789, during the [[French Revolution]], his school was superseded by a system of centrally-controlled state schools. Six years later, he was able to open a private school, supported by his son, the painter Joseph Ignaz Melling (1764–1817), who later operated his own art school in Rastatt.

'''Kathy Rae Huffman''' is an American curator, writer, producer, researcher, lecturer and expert for video and media art. Since the early 1980s, Huffman is said to have helped establish video and new media art, online and interactive art, installation and performance art in the visual arts world. She has curated, written about, and coordinated events for numerous international art institutes, consulted and juried for festivals and alternative arts organisations. Huffman not only introduced video and digital computer art to museum exhibitions, she also pioneered tirelessly to bring television channels and video artists together, in order to show video artworks on TV. From the early 1990s until 2014, Huffman was based in Europe, and embraced early net art and interactive online environments, a curatorial practice that continues. In 1997, she co-founded the [[Faces (online community)|Faces]] mailing list and online community for women working with art, gender and technology. Till today, Huffman is working in the USA, in Canada and in Europe.&lt;br&gt;

== Education ==
Huffman received an MFA in Exhibition Design (with distinction) from the School of Fine Art, California State University Long Beach (CSULB) in 1979 under the supervision of Stacy Dukes, with a second major in Radio/Film/Television. She also completed a two-year postgraduate certificate program in Gallery and Museum Studies from CSULB, under the guidance of Constance Glenn, in 1980. She holds a Life Membership Awarded, [[Phi Kappa Phi]] honor society.
As an art student in the 1970s, Huffman supported herself with a part-time job as 'staff artist' for the Long Beach Public Library system - one of the first institutions to acquire portable video equipment. She used the Sony Portapak to document library events. To learn more about video and its potential as a tool for artmaking, she joined the Museum Studies course at CSULB. Huffman met the video artist [[Bill Viola]] in 1976 and began to work in collaboration with him on his ambitious project, the interactive video and sound installation ''Olfaction''. It was presented at the final group exhibition 'Beyond the Artists' Hand' for the Museum Studies course. ''Olfaction'' worked perfectly for the entire exhibition; since then, Huffman has tried to match that level of achievement for every show she curated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.josephinebosma.com/web/node/80] Interview by Josephine Bosma with Kathy Rae Huffman, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, then deputy director at the Long Beach Museum of Art David Ross invited Huffman to complete her 6-month professional internship, the final requirement of the CSULB Museum Studies course. From 1977 till 1979, Huffman was Video Coordinator for the Los Angeles-based non-profit organization "Some Serious Business, Inc" (directed by Nancy Drew, Susan Martin, and Elizabeth Freeman), and she managed numerous video screening events and Southern California cable television series in collaboration with the LBMA, like the artists program 'Made for TV', organized by 'The Kitchen' (New York City){{fact|date=October 2017}}. In 1978, Huffman was assistant curator and exhibition designer for ''Streamline Moderne'', a survey of household objects, vehicles, and graphic design of the 1930s and 40’s. Curator was Stacy Dukes, at the CSULB Art Gallery.  In 1979, Huffman coordinated ''Picturephone Performance'', a live performance by Nam June Paik and numerous invited artists, between Los Angeles and New York.{{fact|date=October 2017}}&lt;br&gt;


== Professional Practice ==

=== Long Beach Museum of Art, 1979 - 1984 ===
Huffman was appointed Chief Curator at the Long Beach Museum of Art in Long Beach, California in late 1979, after she had served one year as the Video Coordinator for curator Nancy Drew. Under her direction, she established '''LBMA Video''' as a regional media art center, with fundraising for a multimedia workshop and broadcast quality post-production facility for artists at a former (and unused) police precinct in Belmont Shore (a hip, young Long Beach community). This media art center included technical services, video editing studios, a videotape and media art library, production equipment for loan, a performance space, exhibition program, and a visiting artist programme. LBMA Video collaborated with the local cable TV station to produce and present artists on TV. Most important, LBMA Video operated an open door policy, and artists from around the world used its facility. Huffman curated and produced several media art installations in the LBMA, for example by [[Gary Hill]], [[Bill Viola]], Eleanor Antin, [[Dara Birnbaum]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Ant Farm]]. Exhibitions curated and produced by Huffman (selection):

==== Hole in Space ====
Huffman curated and produced the exhibition ''Hole in Space'' at the LBMA in 1980, a groundbreaking live communication sculpture by Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz (K&amp;S). ''Hole in Space'' was the first public video chat, linking large displays on public squares in New York and Los Angeles with a satellite feed. This engineering prototype illustrated K&amp;S's vision of large screen teleconferencing. (But after that event, K&amp;S didn't do large screen teleconferencing again, instead moved to early video streaming via internet.) &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyIJJr6Ldg8]  A Hole in Space LA-NY, 1980 - the mother of all video chats.  30 minutes video documentation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecafe.com/museum/history/ksoverview2.html]  Electronic Cafe: Kit Galloway &amp; Sherrie Rabinowitz - a quarter century of pioneering artistic achievements 1975-2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==== California Video ====
As US Commissioner at the Paris Biennial, and curator of a survey of new video from California, Huffman presented the exhibition ''California Video'' as the American Selection in the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]], 1980. The exhibition toured (with a catalog) through 1982.

==== The Artist and Television ====
Huffman was West Coast segment producer for this live 3 hour television event: ''The Artist and Television'', initiated by [[Jaime Davidovich]], was a live interactive teleconference that took place in Iowa City, Los Angeles and New York City in October 1982. Artists, curators, critics and performers in all three cities interacted with each other via satellite, conducting interviews and presenting live art and musical performances. The event was broadcast nationwide through the American Television and Communications Corporation and ACSN (The Learning Channel). The issues discussed included video as art medium, and the accessibility of broadcast television for artists. The event was produced as a collaboration of the Long Beach Museum of Art, the University of California (Los Angeles), and the University of Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/artist-and-television/oclc/560771255] ''The Artist and Television'', three videotapes that document this live interactive teleconference from 1982&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most successful projects, where artists could try out live performance from three points for the first time ever: ''Atari is the New Parent'', by John Sturgeon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnsturgeon.net/archivedproject/atari-is-the-new-parent/] John Sturgeon: ''Atari is the New Parent'' - a project in the framework of ''The Artist and Television'', 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Artist and the Computer ====
Curator of the first west coast survey of the use of computers in artmaking, including workshops, demonstrations, lectures and performances at the Long Beach Museum of Art, and collaborating institutions California State University Long Beach, and University of Southern California, January–February 1983.

Huffman was event coordinator for the regional Los Angeles county initiative to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of WOMANHOUSE (since 1972) and the founding of the Southern California feminist movement. More than fifty institutions or groups participated in the month-long calendar of event. She also coordinated and co-curated HAUNTED WOMANHOUSE, a feminist performance festival on the Long Beach Museum of Art grounds, and was co-curator, with Lyn Blumenthal, of the video exhibition ''Roles Relationships and Sexuality''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nancybuchanan.net/Resume_2015.pdf] Nancy Buchanan resume&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shared Realities ====

=== Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) Boston / The CAT Fund ===

1984-1991, Huffman was Adjunct Curator at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, Massachusetts. The ICA was Boston's premiere educational and exhibition space for contemporary art. As adjunct curator, Huffman contributed exhibition concepts, community projects, and collaborations with local, regional and national media organizations.

Huffman was appointed curator/producer of [[The Contemporary Art Television Fund / The CAT Fund]], a pilot project of the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston]] and WGBH TV’s New Television Workshop, Boston’s public television station, with a mandate to create a context for artists to define television as a medium for their personal expression. Funded initially by the Massachusetts Art Council, The CAT Fund was designed to play an active role in the development of artists' TV internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.experimentaltvcenter.org/contemporary-art-television-fund] Experimental TV Center: The Contemporary Art Television Fund&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to Southern California, the east coast seemed to Huffman more theoritical and political. The ICA Boston (directed by David Ross) was a very studious environment. Beside this stronger intellectual inspiration, Huffman had the opportunity to be more involved with artists working with digital processes. She commissioned one of [[Bill Seaman]]'s early interactive computer works and presented exhibitions using digital technology. Artists commissioned for 'The CAT Fund' included (among others): Laurie Anderson, Bill Viola, Tony Oursler, Constance de Jong, Joan Jonas, Dara Birnbaum, Raul Ruiz, Marcel Odenbach, Bill Seaman, Daniel Reeves, Ken Fiengold, Chip Lord, Doug Hall, [[Ilene Segalove]], William Wegman and Michael Smith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.aec.at/media/archive/1986/182013/File_01874_AEC_FE_1986.pdf] Ars Electronica Center: Kathy Rae Huffman about the Contemporary Art Television Fund, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

As a media art specialist and communicator, her responsibilities included travel with Suzanne Mészöly (director of SCCA Network, Budapest, Hungary) to develop exchange projects between the newly formed east situated SCCA regional centers. During these early years of national independence from Soviet domination, nationalism and an eye towards the West were predominant in East European countries, which made them targets of exploitation. The SCCA‘s energy was directed towards building skills, technical connectivity, and self-confidence to work collaboratively with other East European centers, as well as with Western media organizations and individuals.

=== Collaborative and (online) communication projects ===

==== Siberian Deal ====
In this project, Huffman acted as a net activist and net artist. Siberian Deal, 1995, was a real travel and virtual internet artwork with Eva Wohlgemuth, which examined the value of objects in post-communist society. During their journey through Siberia, Wohlgemuth and Huffman filled their online cyber diary (today we would call it a weblog) with digital images, videos and text. The journey was a challenging adventure, on the physical and on the technical level, while the internet connection broke down regularly. Their audience interacted and accompanied them by email.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/tp/artikel/4/4828/1.html] Keine Angst vor 0 und 1 - Künstlerinnen erobern das Netz, by Christiane Wettig, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Siberian Deal received the first prize for Interactive Art at the ''VideoFest'' Berlin 1996  (now media art festival [[Transmediale]]). In the same year, it was presented at the ''Next 5 Minutes'' (n5m) conference in Amsterdam. The original travel report isn't online anymore.&lt;ref&gt;Siberian Deal: Snapshots of icf.de/siberian_deal are available at the [[Wayback Machine]]&lt;/ref&gt; The website was featured in numerous festivals and exhibitions, and a text by Paoli Bianchi was included in the Kunstforum International special issue II of the Art of Travel, Spring 1997. The multi-media analysis and review of the trading of objects during travels in Siberia isn't online anymore.&lt;ref&gt;Siberian Deal review: Snapshots of  t0.or.at/~siberian/vrteil.htm  are available at the Internet Archive [[Wayback Machine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Face Settings ====
The second collaborative internet artwork with Eva Wohlgemuth, 1996-1998: A project of internet communication and of cooking meetings in various international cities between women in remote European regions. Women working in various artistic and scientific disciplines met in Russia, Serbia, Spain (Basque), the United Kingdom (Scotland) and Austria. They were united in a common net strategy regionally, for information exchange, theoretical development, and artistic expression. The project initiated a female-only mailing list of media specialists of more than 100 women from twenty countries.&lt;ref&gt;Face Settings: http://thing.at/face/ isn't online anymore - a few snapshots are at the Internet Archive [[Wayback Machine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pop~TARTS ====
1996-1997, Huffman was co-author with Margarete Jahrmann (a multi-media artist from Vienna) of a regular column for the Telepolis Magazine of Net Culture, sponsored by Heise Verlag, Hannover, the largest German language publisher of technical journals (IX, CT). As tele-workers, Pop~TARTS developed a palaver type of writing, in a series of informative topics, events, and interactions, in German and English. Texts were built-up jointly, by filtering the enormous data-flow on the internet from a female perspective, and inviting reader participation. Huffman and Jahrmann looked for intersections between theory and practice of websites with a focus on women and communications projects. It started as a multimedia column with a lot of involvement by other women and generated a huge amount of data. After trying out several concepts for its structure, Pop~TARTS became a more straight forward platform for texts on events and certain topics Huffman and Jahrmann chose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/tp/] Telepolis, online newspaper by Heise Medien GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Hannover&lt;/ref&gt;

'Face Settings' and 'Pop~TARTS' were projects to build up networks and online communities, mainly among women in the media arts and media theory, and brought together offline and online communication. FACES, established in 1997, resulted after Face Settings as the online forum for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faces-l.net] FACES online forum for women in media arts and media theory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== Donations ===
Huffman has donated a significant selection of her curatorial library of books to Goldsmiths art college library (the Kathy Rae Huffman Media Art Library) in London, including catalogues and rare documentation of media and video art of the 1970s -1990s. It gives insight into the practice of media art, before internet. Most of these publications are not online - they were limited productions, not widely distributed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ica.org.uk/blog/pioneering-media-art-interview-kathy-rae-huffman] Pioneering Media Art: An Interview with Kathy Rae Huffman by Dimitra Gkitska, for the ICA London Bulletin&lt;/ref&gt;	She has placed her personal, curatorial video collection of approximately 1000 VHS titles for preservation at the North West Film Archive in Manchester, in association with the Manchester School of Art, in 2008.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="115496">{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of music biographies in Rees's ''Cyclopaedia''}}
The music articles in [[Rees's Cyclopaedia|Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'']] were written by [[Charles Burney]] (1726–1814), with additional material by [[John Farey, sr]] (1766–1826), and [[John Farey, Jr]] (1791–1851), and illustrated by 53 plates as well a numerous examples of music typset within the articles.

Charles Burney was well known as the author of a ''General History of Music'', 4 vol 1776–1789 and two travel diaries recording his Musical Tours collecting information in France and Italy, and later Germany, 1+2 vol, 1771 and 1773, as well as the ''Commemoration of Handel'', 1785 and his ''Musical Memoirs of Metastasio'', 1796. John Farey, sr was a polymath, well known today for his work as a geologist and for his investigations of the mathematics of sound, and the schemes of temperamant used in tuning musical instruments then. His son, John Farey, jr, was also polymathic in his interests. He contributed numerous drawings for the illustrations of mostly technological and scientific topics in Rees's Cyclopaedia.

Burney's music biographies range from antiquity to the first decade of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipking|first1=Lawrence|title=The Ordering of the Arts in Eighteenth-Century England|date=1970|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=318–319|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote 756 articles, and while great number of the names, such as Mozart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oldman|first1=C. B.|title=Dr Burney and Mozart|journal=Mozart Jahrbuch|date=1964|volume=1962/63|pages=75–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; were featured in his earlier writings,  others are unique to the ''Cyclopaedia''. These mainly concern minor London musicians and singers, whom Burney had known personally in his young days. Some are known through modern reference books, but others, often with only surname, only have their memory recorded in the pages of the ''Cyclopaedia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lonsdale|first1=Roger|title=Dr Charles Burney|date=1965|publisher=Oxford: The Clarendon Press|page=412|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a few cases Burney has anglicised Christian names — John Frederick Reichardt, instead of Johann Friedrich, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Rees's Cyclopaedia, vol 29&lt;/ref&gt;

In his biographies Burney mirrored the ''Lives of the Poets'' by Samuel Johnson, namely: a short summary of the subject's reputation, with a summary of his career, a list of his works and an account of his genius and his contribution to music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackerness|first1=E. D.|title=Dr Burney, Biographer|journal=Contemporary Review|date=1956|volume=CLXXXIX [189]|pages=352–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lonsdale has commented that a handful of Burney biographical articles are misplaced in the alphabetical sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Lonsdale, Roger, 'Dr Burney's 'Dictionary of Music' ',''Musicology Australia'', vol. 5, no. 1, p.&amp;nbsp; 162, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; These occur mostly under the letter A, and were missed in the early stages of writing, when Burney was trying to overtake the press, for he did not start composing the texts until the summer of 1801, when the work was already underway. One, [[Jacques Arcadelt|Jacques Arkadelt]] in Vol 2, appears twice, as Giacomo Arkadelt in Vol, 16 where he is listed in the middle of the Gs, but with a shorter article.

'''ALPHABETISATION OF ARTICLES'''

The work followed the common practice of conflating the letters I and J and U and V into single sequences. The topics included in this list therefore follow the sequence they appear in the original volumes.

'''ANNOTATION'''

The articles are annotated to [[Frank Mercer (writer on music)|Mercer]]'s edition of Burney's ''History'' (1935) and [[Percy Scholes|Scholes]]'s edition of Burney's ''Travels'' (1959). Where a page reference is given the text can be found there. Where a book is cited, but with no page, index entries were found, and Burney is presumed to have written his article using the information there. Where there is no annotation, the article must be unique to the ''Cyclopaedia''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5260">'''''Little Cherry''''' ({{zh|c=小樱桃|p=Xiǎo Yīng Táo}}) is a Chinese media franchise created by Yangshang Jun. Owned by the [[Zhengzhou]]-based Xiao Ying Tao Comics Company, it is primarily comedy [[manhua]] featuring a girl whose name is also Little Cherry. The "Xiao Ying Tao" name in the media works and the company is sometimes abbreviated '''XOYTO'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese Animation “Xoyto” Goes Overseas|url=http://www.cmmintelligence.com/media-news/2008-11-18/chinese-animation-%E2%80%9Cxoyto%E2%80%9D-goes-overseas|accessdate=2016-02-07|work=Chinese Media Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Little Cherry character was created in the late 1990s while Yangshang Jun worked for the magazine ''Comics Monthly'' (漫画月刊). The comics originally appeared in the ''[[Southern Weekly]]'' newspaper and other media, and gained popularity in few months. Yangshang exited her job for a freelance one on September 1999. On August 2000, the Zhejiang Literature and Art Publishing House published the first Little Cherry comic book volumes which initially sold out. In the next month, Yangshang registered the Zhengzhou Little Cherry Cartoon Art Co. At one point there was a circulation of 17 million comic book copies. Derivative works and products included beverages, [[Flash animation]], and toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chen|first1=Wei|title=樱桃女孩的品牌长征|url=http://finance.sina.com.cn/leadership/brandmanage/20071212/12004281807.shtml|accessdate=2017-10-11|work=Sina Finance|date=2007-12-12|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Han|first1=Xiaodou|title=“樱桃女孩”杨尚君:爱就住在我心里|url=http://www.xzbu.com/6/view-2223786.htm|accessdate=2017-10-11|work=Xzbu.com|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fan|first1=Junqiang|title=杨尚君:杨家“樱桃”初长成|url=http://www.xzbu.com/7/view-8403605.htm|accessdate=2017-10-11|work=Xzbu.com|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a 26 episode animated television series adaptation debuted on [[China Central Television|CCTV]]. The second season premiered on July 2010, in which at that time the third season was reportedly in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Xiang|first1=Chen|title=《小樱桃2》央视首播，图书出版权落入湘少社囊中|url=http://www.gmw.cn/01ds/2010-07/28/content_1206349.htm|accessdate=2016-02-07|work=Guangming Daily (China)|date=2010-07-28|language=Chinese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924094403/http://www.gmw.cn/01ds/2010-07/28/content_1206349.htm|archivedate=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the ''Little Cherry Rescue Angels'' comic received the Golden Dragon Award for best children's comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=《小樱桃·拯救天使》获中国漫画最高奖|url=http://news.163.com/12/1008/01/8D8PMCJ700014AED.html|accessdate=2016-02-07|publisher=NetEase|date=2012-10-08|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ljubljana Graphic School''' is an internationally known group of artists whose art developed with [[Ljubljana Biennial of Graphic Arts]] and local [[Academy of Fine Arts in Ljubljana]].

The informal beginnings of the Ljubljana school of graphic arts are linked to the year 1955 and the first international graphic arts exhibition (later biennial). The endeavour for high technical perfection of the graphic print mainly carried out in the techniques of [[etching]] and [[aquatint]], the precision and the aspiration for the independence of printmaking as a medium were the main features of the group.

It still is Slovenia's most successful art brands that have established themselves on the international art scene.

'''Openness''' is an overarching concept or philosophy that is characterized by an emphasis on [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and free, unrestricted access to knowledge and [[freedom of information|information]], as well as collaborative or cooperative management and [[decentralized decision-making|decision-making]] rather than a central [[authority]].&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;{{cite web|last=Peters|first=Michael|title=The Idea of Openness: Open Education and Education for Openness|url=http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=open_education_and_education_for_openness|work=The Encyclopaedia of Educational Philosophy and Theory|accessdate=1 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20140501132743/http://eepat.net/doku.php?id=open_education_and_education_for_openness|archivedate=1 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Openness can be said to be the opposite of [[secrecy]].&lt;ref name=Peters /&gt;

== In government ==
{{Main article|Open government}}
'''Open government''' is the governing [[doctrine]] which holds that citizens have the right to access the documents and proceedings of the government to allow for effective public [[Regulation|oversight]].&lt;ref name="ruma"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Lathrop |editor2-first=Laurel |editor2-last=Ruma |title= Open Government: Transparency, Collaboration and Participation in Practice |publisher= O'Reilly Media |date=February 2010  |url = https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24435672M/Open_Government |isbn= 978-0-596-80435-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Openness in government applies the idea of [[freedom of information]] to information held by authorities and holds that citizens should have the right to see the operations and activities of government at work.&lt;ref name = "Birkinshaw"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birkinshaw|first=Patrick|title=FREEDOM OF INFORMATION AND OPENNESS: FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS?|journal=Administrative Law Review|volume=58|issue=1|pages=177–218|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=ac4899af-cdac-4b67-8b67-d0f7951e70b3%40sessionmgr115&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=124&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=bth&amp;AN=20477744&amp;anchor=AN0020477744-10|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since reliable information is requisite for accountability, freedom of access to information about the government supports government accountability and helps protect other necessary rights.&lt;ref name = "Birkinshaw"/&gt;

== In creative works ==
{{Main article|Open content}}

[[Open content]] and [[free content]] both refer to creative works that lack restrictions on how people can use, modify, and distribute them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freedomdefined.org/Definition |title=Definition of Free Cultural Works |accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html |title=Free Software and Free Manuals |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |last=Stallman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Stallman |date=November 13, 2008 |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grossman"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Grossman| first = Lev| title = New Free License to Cover Content Online| work = Netly News|accessdate = 2010-01-12| date = 1998-07-18| url = http://www.time.com/time/digital/daily/0,2822,621,00.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000619122406/http://www.time.com/time/digital/daily/0,2822,621,00.html |archivedate = 2000-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The terms derive from [[open source software]] and [[free software]], similar concepts that refer specifically to software.&lt;ref name="Open Content"&gt;{{cite web

== In education ==
{{Main article|Open education}}
Open education refers to institutional practices and programmatic initiatives that broaden access to the learning and training traditionally offered through formal education systems.  By eliminating [[barriers to entry]], [[open education]] aids freedom of information by increasing accessibility.

Open Education advocates state people from all social classes worldwide have open access to high-quality education and resources. They help eliminate obstacles like high costs, outmoded materials, and legal instruments. These barriers impede collaboration among stakeholders. Cooperation is crucial to open education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-education|title=What is open education?|work=Opensource.com|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Open Education Consortium claims “Sharing is a fundamental attribute of education. Education means the sharing of knowledge, insights, and information with everybody. It is the foundation of new wisdom, ideas, talents, and understanding&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oeconsortium.org/|title=The Open Education Consortium {{!}} The Global Network for Open Education|website=www.oeconsortium.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.”Open Educational Resources refer to learning materials that educators can improve and modify with permission from their publishers or authors. Creators of OERs are allowed to include a variety of items such as lesson plans, presentation slides, lecture videos, podcasts, worksheets, maps, and images&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/access-to-knowledge/open-educational-resources/what-are-open-educational-resources-oers/|title=What are Open Educational Resources (OERs)? {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== In academia ==
{{Main article|Open access}}
[[Open access]] refers to the practice of allowing peer-reviewed research articles to be available online free of charge and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions.&lt;ref name=Suber&gt;{{cite web|last=Suber|first=Peter|title=Open Access Overview|url=http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Benefits of this approach include: accelerated discovery and progress as researchers are free to use and build on the findings of others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Case for Open Access|url=http://www.plos.org/open-access/|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving back to the public as much research is paid for with public funds,&lt;ref name=Suber2&gt;{{cite web|last=Suber|first=Peter|title=The taxpayer argument for open access|url=http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/09-04-03.htm#taxpayer|work=SPARC Open Access Newsletter, issue #65|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and greater impact for one's work due to [[open access]] articles being accessible to a bigger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harnad|first=Steven|author2=Tim Brody|title=Comparing the Impact of Open Access (OA) vs. Non-OA Articles in the Same Journals|journal=D-Lib Magazine|volume=10|url=http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/260207/1/06harnad.html|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In information technology ==
{{Main article|Code of Openness}}
Openness is a capability provided by an IT system, and it is characterized by interoperability, portability and extensibility. These capabilities are implemented using IT interfaces, standards and the [[Information technology architecture|IT architecture]]. All these are technical aspects of openness. Openness is also based on non-technical aspects, which are related to the partnership between the involved partners (IT customers, IT vendors and/or IT service providers).&lt;ref name="CPO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steven|first1=Vettermann|title=Code of Openness|url=http://www.prostep.org/en/cpo.html|website=CPO|publisher=ProSTEP iViP|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In psychology == 
In psychology, [[openness to experience]] is one of the domains which are used to describe human personality in the [[Five Factor Model]].

[[File:Room 95 David Vases 6747.JPG|thumb|right|The David Vases, said to be two of the best-known Chinese porcelains in the world.]]

The '''Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art''' is a collection of Chinese [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]] and related items, on permanent display in its own gallery in Room 95 at the [[British Museum]]. The Foundation's main purpose is to promote the study and teaching of [[Chinese art]] and culture. The collection consists of some 1,700 pieces of [[Song dynasty|Song]], [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]], [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasty porcelain from the 10th century to the 18th, as well as a painting, ''Scroll of Antiquities (Guwan tu)'' dating from the Yongzheng (1723–35) reign.

The collection concentrates on pieces in the "Chinese taste" rather than export wares, and on Imperial porcelain, much of it [[Jingdezhen ware]].  It includes superb examples of the rare [[Ru ware|Ru]] and [[Guan ware]]s and two important Yuan dynasty [[blue and white porcelain]] temple vases (the "David Vases"), the oldest dated [[blue and white porcelain]] pieces, from 1351.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/press_releases/2009/chinese_ceramics.aspx British Museum Press release]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Foundation also has a large library of Western and East Asian books related to Chinese art; this and archival material are housed in the library of [[SOAS, University of London|SOAS]] (School of Oriental and African Studies), University of London.

In 1950, the Collection was presented to the [[University of London]] by the collector and scholar Sir [[Percival David]], who had assembled it.

==History==
[[File:Room 95-6753.JPG|thumb|left|Two flasks with dragons, 1403–24.]]

The collection dates back to 1927 when many of the items in the [[Forbidden City]] were being sold off by [[eunuch]]s and other members of the [[Imperial Household Department]]. [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] is said to have used many items as collateral for loans from various Chinese banks in 1901. David convinced the officials to mount a display of many of the best items. When they started to come on the market, David managed to buy some forty pieces one way or the other and export them to the United States. In 1930, he again returned to China and helped with various exhibitions and produced a series of catalogues of the pieces. He also acquired more items through various dealers in [[Beijing]]. This means that many pieces were once owned by the [[Qing dynasty]] emperors and several pieces have inscriptions added by the orders of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] (1736–95).

In 1931, David's collection was displayed in the [[Dorchester Hotel]] in [[London]]. It remained there until it was evacuated to the countryside during [[World War II]]. David also created a Chair in Chinese Art and Architecture with the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], which is part of the University of London. Towards the end of his life he was determined to keep the collection together, and to this end entered negotiations with the [[University of London]]. An agreement was reached to keep the collection and the library together in a foundation attached to [[SOAS]].

The chair that David had created was also moved to SOAS. Previous holders of the chair, called the Percival David Professor of Chinese and East Asian Art, include [[William Watson (sinologist)|William Watson]], Roderick Whitfield and [[Craig Clunas]]. The current incumbent is Shane McCausland. Just before the opening of the collection, the foundation was also given a small collection of porcelain belonging to [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]]. The collection was opened to the public on 10 June 1952 in a house in [[Gordon Square]], [[Bloomsbury]].

[[File:Bloomsbury, Percival David Foundation of Chinese Art - geograph.org.uk - 670998.jpg|The former home of the Percival David Foundation in Gordon Square|thumb|right]]

The Foundation has been a generous lender to other countries. It lent many items of [[Yuan dynasty]] porcelain to [[Venice]]'s 700th-anniversary celebration of [[Marco Polo]]'s expedition. It has also sent other items to places as far away as Japan and the United States.

The Library collection was a working library and as such was open to researchers from around the world.

==Relocation==
[[File:Room 95-6752.JPG|thumb|left|Room 95, British Museum.]]

Due to a funding crisis, the [[Gordon Square]] building housing the Foundation's collection closed at the end of 2007. The ceramics collection has been loaned on a long-term basis to the [[British Museum]], where the whole collection, about 1,700 objects, is on permanent public display in a specially designed new gallery (Room 95, [[British Museum Department of Asia|British Museum]]) opened in April 2009, thanks to the generosity of Sir Joseph Hotung.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Museum]] Press release.{{where|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public gallery is part of the Sir Joseph Hotung Centre for Ceramic Studies, which will include facilities to use the collection for teaching.

''Chinese Ceramics: Highlights of the Sir Percival David Collection'', by Regina Krahl and Jessica Harrison-Hall, was published in April 2009 by the British Museum Press to coincide with the opening of the new display.

[[File:Correggio_058.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of a Man with a Book'']]
'''''Portrait of a Man with a Book''''' is an oil on canvas painting by [[Correggio]], dated to around 1522. It was bequeathed to the [[Pinacoteca del Castello Sforzesco]] in Milan (where it now hangs) in 1945 by Lydia Caprara Morando Attendolo Bolognini. It is sometimes instead attributed to [[Parmigianino]] but majority opinion is that it dates to Correggio's first mature period, which is supported by the fact that it was painted directly on top of the sketch, an informal technique suggesting it was made for a close friend of the artist.

It shows a man in a black coat and black cap three-quarter-length against a wooded background, reading from a tiny book held in his right hand, argued by [[Roberto Longhi]] to be a [[book of hours]]&lt;ref&gt;''Edizione delle opere complete'', Roberto Longhi. Author, Roberto Longhi. Publisher, Sansoni, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and by others such as Muzzi to be a ''Petrarchino'' (ie a miniature edition of [[Petrarch]]'s ''[[Il Canzoniere]]''). If it is the latter, the bee in the background may refer to poems CXC and CCCXIX of the work.

[[Image:Posterization example.jpg|thumb|300px|Example of a photograph in [[JPEG]] format (24-bit color or 16.7 million colors) before posterization, contrasting the result of saving to [[GIF]] format (256 colors). Posterization occurs across the image, but is most obvious in areas of subtle variation in tone.]]
[[Image:Lucidity I.jpg|thumb|300px|Posterized photo of a [[hibiscus]].]]

'''Posterization''' or '''posterisation''' of an image entails conversion of a continuous gradation of tone to several regions of fewer tones, with abrupt changes from one tone to another.  This was originally done with photographic processes to create [[poster]]s.  It can now be done photographically or with digital image processing, and may be deliberate or an unintended artifact of [[color quantization]].

==Cause==
The effect may be created deliberately, or happen accidentally.  For artistic effect, most [[image editing]] programs provide a posterization feature, or photographic processes may be used. 

Unwanted posterization, also known as [[color banding|banding]], may occur when the [[color depth]], sometimes called bit depth, is insufficient to accurately sample a continuous gradation of color tone. As a result, a continuous gradient appears as a series of discrete steps or bands of color — hence the name. When discussing [[fixed pixel display]]s, such as LCD and plasma televisions, this effect is referred to as false contouring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/4520-7874_1-5107912-7.html#falsecontouring |title=HDTV World Glossary |accessdate=2007-06-06 |year=2007 |publisher=CNET Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Compression artifact|compression]] in image formats such as [[JPEG]] can also result in posterization when a smooth gradient of colour or luminosity is compressed into discrete quantized blocks with stepped gradients. The result may be compounded further by an [[optical illusion]], called the [[Mach bands|Mach band illusion]], in which each band appears to have an intensity gradient in the direction opposing the overall gradient. This problem may be resolved, in part, with [[Dither#Digital photography and image processing|dithering]].

== Photographic process ==
Posterization is a process in photograph development which converts normal photographs into an image consisting of distinct, but flat, areas of different tones or colors. A posterized image often has the same general appearance, but portions of the original image that presented gradual transitions are replaced by abrupt changes in shading and gradation from one area of tone to another. Printing posterization from black and white requires density separations, which one then prints on the same piece of paper to create the whole image. Separations may be made by density or color, using different exposures. Density Separations may be created by printing three prints of the same picture, each at a different exposure time that will be combined for the final image.

== Applications ==
Typically, posterization is used for tracing [[contour lines]] and [[raster to vector|vectorizing photo-realistic images]]. This tracing process starts with 1 bit per channel and advances to 4 bits per channel. As the bits per channel increases, the number of levels of lightness a color can display increases.

A visual artist, faced with [[line art]] that has been damaged through JPEG compression, may consider posterizing the image as a first step to remove artifacts on the edges of the image.

==Posterizing time {{anchor|Temporal posterization}} ==
Temporal posterization is the [[visual effect]] of reducing the [[frame rate|number of frames]] of [[video]], while not reducing the speed at which it actually plays.  This compares to regular posterization, where the number of individual color variations is reduced, while the overall range of colors is not.  The motion effect is similar to the effect of a flashing strobe light, but without the contrast of bright and dark.  Unlike a [[Telecine|pulldown]], the unused frames are simply discarded, and it is intended to be apparent (longer than the [[persistence of vision]] that [[video]] and [[motion picture]]s normally depend on). An [[animated GIF]] often looks posterized because of its normally-low frame rate.

More formally, this is [[downsampling]] in the time dimension, as it is reducing the resolution (precision of the ''input''), not the bit rate (precision of the ''output,'' as in posterization).

The resulting stop-go motion is a temporal form of [[jaggies]]; formally, a form of [[aliasing]]. This effect may be the intention, but to reduce the frame rate without introducing this effect, one may use [[temporal anti-aliasing]], which yields [[motion blur]].

Compare with [[Slow motion#Time stretching|time stretching]], which ''adds'' frames.

'''''Orange Prince (1984)''''' is a painting by American artist [[Andy Warhol]], of [[Prince (musician)|Prince Rogers Nelson]] (1958–2016), the American singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist, actor, and director.

''Orange Prince'' ''(1984)'' is considered an important late work referencing Warhol's portraits from the early 1960s, of movie stars and celebrity icons, such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Jacqueline Kennedy]]. Art historian and Warhol expert [[Thomas E. Crow]] believes that Warhol's portrait of Prince shows much greater freedom of expression, as in the early portraits. This is especially evident when compared to Warhol's more 'factory-line' style of portraits from the 1970s onwards, which were mainly commissions.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; 

Prince did not commission the Warhol portraits, which stayed in Warhol's private collection until he died. Crow believes Warhol was fascinated by Prince, who was not in Warhol's direct circle. He says that Warhol was drawn to Prince's edgy image, which acted as inspiration for the art work:&lt;blockquote&gt;"(Warhol's) evident fascination with Prince, known for sexual frankness in his music and an androgynous style in his clothes, make-up, and hairstyle, echoed similar traits among those he famously gathered around himself in the [[The Factory|Factory]] entourage of the 1960s."&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/44T6MBA/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al__nysdce-17-02532__0032.3.pdf |title=Expert analysis of Warhol's painting of Prince (1984) |author=Thomas E. Crow |date=May 2018 |website=www.pacermonitor.com|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/andy-warhol-self-portrait-1966 |title=Self-Portrai |author=Andy Warhol |date=1966 |website=MoMALearning |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art |access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Composition ==
''Orange Prince'' uses a photograph as its source image, which depicts Prince in the burgeoning stages of his career in 1981, three years before the painting was created. The original color photograph shows Prince in a full length pose, from which Warhol isolated the head only for the portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/photographs/xx5frv/Prince-1981|title=Prince, 1981|website=www.morrisonhotelgallery.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;

The composition of ''Orange Prince'' makes direct reference to the portraits Warhol produced in the 1960s, as Crow points out in his 2018 analysis of the painting, and is similar in composition to Warhol's Marilyn series where the subject's head 'floats' in day-glo color.

According to Crow, the composition is distinct from other late portraits, the majority of which were commissions and followed a commercial formula, such as Warhol's portrait of [[Michael Jackson]] which was commissioned and created a few months before ''Orange Prince.'' As Crow says: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Warhol’s 1984 portrait (of Prince)...harked back to the independently conceived celebrity likenesses of his earlier career (from the 1960s). As Prince had not commissioned any of the paintings, Warhol could experiment with far more variations in background patterns and colors."&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The face of the subject is depicted in a neon orange color, the same as the background. The facial outline, features and hair are in black. Highlights of green and blue are woven onto the screen amongst the black line around the subject's facial features, hair and ears. The overall effect is to make the subject [[Luminescence|luminesce]], with a trade-mark Warhol flatness to the image, due partly to the very little graduation of shading.

== Prince and Andy Warhol ==
Prince and Andy Warhol were personally acquainted, as Warhol's diary entries show.&lt;ref name="1928–1987" /&gt;

On a number of occasions in the early 1980s Prince had appeared in [[Interview (magazine)|''Andy Warhol's Interview Magazine'']]. In the April 1980 edition Prince appears in a full-page photograph by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/remembering-prince|title=Remembering Prince - Interview Magazine|date=2016-04-21|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glasstire.com/2016/04/22/prince-1958-2016/|title=Prince (1958-2016) – Glasstire|website=glasstire.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol attended a number of Prince concerts in the 1980s, including one of the very earliest in New York. On December 9, 1980, Prince played [[The Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]] in New York as part of his ''[[Dirty Mind Tour]]''. The club was only half-full, but as music critic [[Nik Cohn]] reported, "Andy Warhol and his claque showed up, and so did a number of music-biz faces. Before the show, they lounged in poses of practised cool. Then Prince appeared, and cool went up in flames".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/prince-interview-quotes|title=Prince, the godfather of R&amp;B, had his fingerprints everywhere|last=Cohn|first=Nik|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the December 1981 edition of Warhol's ''Interview'' magazine Prince appears in a controversial image showing him in the shower, and a crucifix on the wall behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/prince-showers-for-controversy|title=Flashback: Prince Showers for Controversy - Interview Magazine|date=2012-09-21|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fall 1984, Warhol created ''Orange Prince''. Prince had released the ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'' album and movie that year and was well known internationally. 

On August 2, 1986, Warhol was in the front row at Prince's concert at [[Madison Square Garden]]. In his diary entry of their meeting, Warhol described sitting down at the concert "...just as Prince jumps out naked, or almost, and it's the greatest concert I've ever seen there, just so much energy and excitement."&lt;ref name="1928–1987"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Andy Warhol diaries |last=Warhol |first=Andy |editor-last=Hackett |editor-first=Pat |isbn=9781455561452 |publisher=Twelve |location=New York, NY |oclc=881024850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards at the New York dance club, [[Palladium (New York City)|The Palladium]], Warhol reported that he was very excited to be invited to an after-party hosted by Prince, and fascinated by him. Warhol described arriving at the party and seeing Prince appear in the near-empty club "...in a white coat and pink bellbottoms, like a Puerto Rican at a prom, all by himself". He also stated Prince was a gracious host who remembered the names of the many individuals in Warhol's entourage that night, and how Prince made sure he danced with everyone.

The same party was also attended by [[Billy Idol]]; seeing Prince and Idol together, Warhol observed that "Hollywood glamour girls" such as [[Jean Harlow]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] had been supplanted by "glamour boys" such as Prince and Idol—a development that Warhol found completely fascinating and "...so weird".&lt;ref name="1928–1987"/&gt;

That night, Prince agreed to appear on the December 1986 cover of Warhol's Interview magazine, which Warhol described in his diary:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We asked Prince if he would be our December cover and he said we'd have to talk to his manager and we said that we'd asked the manager and the manager said to ask him, and so they said they'd work it out. We were just shaking, it was so exciting."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Warhol's portrait of Prince was created in 1984, two years before their post-concert meeting in 1986, and remained in Warhol's own collection until he died in 1987.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; 

== Technique ==
''Orange Prince'' was created using a complex tracing and [[Screen printing|silkscreening]] process, using layers of colors of silkscreen ink on top of a hand-painted orange ground of acrylic polymer paint, applied to [[Canvas print|canvas]]. The technique was popularised by Warhol, and is synonymous with the artist from the 1960s onwards, when he produced his early portraits of [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Marlon Brando]], and other Hollywood movie stars and celebrities of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/21-days-of-andy-warhol/2013/11/andy-warhol-and-his-process.html|title=Andy Warhol &amp; His Process|last=Sotheby's|first=|date=10 Nov 2013|website=sothebys.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1989 MoMA catalogue of Warhol's work, includes a comprehensive description of Warhol's silkscreening technique, provided by the British curator and author Marco Livingstone under the title, “Do It Yourself: Notes on Warhol’s Technique.”&lt;blockquote&gt;A pencil tracing was taken from the full sized [transparent] acetate prepared for the photographic screen. Either by transferring the penciled line by pressing onto the front of the acetate or sheet of paper, or by placing a sheet of carbon paper beneath the tracing and then drawing the line one section at a time, a rough guide was established for each color area, for example, the lips and the eyelids. The colors were then brushed on by hand, often with the use of masking tape to create a clean junction between them, with the eventual imposition of the black screened image also serving to obscure any unevenness in the line. The acetates were examined by Warhol before they were made into screens, so that he could indicate by means of instructions, written and drawn with china-marking crayon, any changes to be made: for example, to increase the tonal contrast by removing areas of half-tone, thereby flattening the image. The position of the image would be established by taping the four corners of the acetate to the canvas and then tearing off the tape along the corner edges of the acetate; the fragments of tape remaining on the canvas would serve as a guide in locating the screen on top. The position of the screen would be confirmed by eye, and it would then be printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_1815_300161087.pdf |title=Andy Warhol, a retrospective : [brochure] the Museum of Modern Art, New York, February 6 to May 2, 1989 |date=1989 |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Orange Marilyn, 1962, silkscreen painting by Andy Warhol.jpeg|thumb|''Orange Marilyn'', 1962, is a silkscreen painting by Andy Warhol from the Marilyn Flavors series.

== Warhol's orange paintings ==
A number of important silkscreen works by Andy Warhol use the color orange. Some of the first silkscreen works from the 1960s use orange as the dominant color, and Warhol continued to use orange in his paintings throughout his lifetime. ''Orange Prince'' shares a compositional style to ''Orange Marilyn'', 1962. A number of orange paintings by Warhol are in museum collections around the world:

The effect of bright colors in Warhol's work is to draw renewed focus to the subject matter. In the ''Death and Disaster'' series of paintings the graphic images Warhol took from tabloid newspaper stories of the time are a stark counterpoint to the candy-color palette. Another example of this is ''Twelve Electric Chairs'' from 1964, which consists of twelve highly contrasting colored images of the electric chair, including ''Orange Little Electric Chair,'' 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/306853/death-and-death-and-death-by-warhol/|title=Death and Death and Death by Warhol|date=2016-06-22|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2017, a leading art industry newsletter, Baer Faxt, reported that Warhol’s Orange Marilyn sold in a private transaction for $250 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://assets2.pacermonitor.com/filings/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al__nysdce-17-02532__0060.1.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=FQoGZXIvYXdzEIj%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaDFbY044zFyY8bD2myiK3A68z6LvG76TbkfqGMpaaBS8m7uWWyVK5eCsEv%2FpI4Fnl7OjzcrzGEM21YaPitEAgKuEDBdDqovfp%2BV9TJ76lgbD%2FTNqp0POody5rediUNetECE2vNsLgWc2amy1ZOu3biDw4A%2FpXn1cbWZYUhTsUK3yKRcJ3RZ%2FTIpDrna9udqcgsYXSLdurozjAWQzsue5lxtWDVcBiaz9Ig4Xn3ytNO80slqq7DItFcrrxOv7Ywq6bdgx6hP0bptqayCko2tvQdUbAP2FXT6kjS8AFPpCFvmEDlv9hPDtshqNO2M%2BSHR%2F1EP3JwOoPmzaQxH%2Fg6zplJfq8jQYI8bS6hUOoftnD4ht5L1Ddg5WBajvIWXkHWLKuytWc4SC6jAOrsrBj%2FWoLyHGN6sOF1GcAMjr9axS6YqD%2Bk4shA2GTFBk1kJC%2F0CwursUeNaiJh1iyDGdKOEEe9CvwTuXAVvD6Ga7xs0FP%2Beca9hGlR%2BFuwoBqPIfkNzP98Ip%2BEshAtgoguAC%2Beh7EP99XLk4wXbGYL3HwNX%2B7Tp3jDwpJ50z%2FsW7tW3rAmh6KzBxyDdnlAlTuSSNjt%2FP4PVRcz88miwwo%2Fs2n3gU%3D&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20181019T145627Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=600&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIA5OSMEZQHIX2MTBXV%2F20181019%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=03c5bd1110bde5df7cf53549731be259c6e59561b57eab01bbe6a38e78bda18d|title=Warhol expert, Laura Paulson, on Warhol's paintings of Prince|last=Laura|first=Paulson|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prince's favorite color was orange ==
In 2017 Prince's sister, Tyka Nelson, confirmed that Prince's favorite color was ''orange'', and not purple, as assumed. Also that Prince often wore all-orange stage outfits, had orange sets for concerts and his favorite item was his custom-built orange Cloud guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/08/prince-orange-favorite-color-purple/|title=Prince’s Sister Says His Favorite Color Was Actually Orange, Not Purple|date=2017-08-29|work=Spin|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern-day icon ==
Art historian, Thomas Crow, believes Warhol depicts Prince as a "modern-day icon" in his painting, referencing religious iconographic paintings: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Warhol's portrait of Prince] returned Warhol to the origins of his art-critical credibility, that is, the flattened, emblematic, minimally descriptive manner that had characterized his first, definitive phase as an artist."&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Marilyn Diptych'', 1962, is an early example of iconography in Warhol's work, the image repeated many times to emphasise the ubiquity of celebrity and references a form of religious painting in its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/later-europe-and-americas/modernity-ap/a/warhol-marilyn-diptych|title=Warhol, Marilyn Diptych|website=Khan Academy|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marilyn "Flavors" portraits – thirteen unique paintings of Marilyn Monroe with different color backgrounds – are also amongst the first examples of Warhol's iconographic style, and graphic use of saturated block color, held by art historians to highlight a manufactured celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/andy-warhol-1928-1987-orange-marilyn-4806391-details.aspx|title=Essay by Trevor Fairbrother on the iconographic style of Warhol's portraits including the Marilyn single portrait series from 1962|last=|first=|date=|website=www.christies.com|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1=George Frei |editor2=Neil Printz |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Catalogue-Raisonn%C3%A9-Paintings-Sculptures-1961-1963/dp/0714840866/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519842007&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=andy+warhol+catalogue+raisonne |title=Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonné, Paintings and Sculptures 1961–1963 |author=Andy Warhol Foundation |date=11 Mar 2002 |publisher=Phaidon Press |isbn=9780714840864 |edition=Slp |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Robert Rosenblum was personally close to Warhol and wrote about Warhol's Catholic religious observance, which informed Rosenblum's observation about the 1962 ''Gold Marilyn'' in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art: &lt;blockquote&gt;"When Warhol took a photographic silkscreen of Marilyn Monroe’s head, set it on gold paint, and let it float high in a timeless, spaceless heaven..., he was creating, in effect, a secular saint for the 1960s that might well command as much earthly awe and veneration as, say, a Byzantine Madonna hovering for eternity on a gold mosaic ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://laurel.lso.missouri.edu:2083/iii/encore/record/C__Rb13563936__Sjoe%20rosenblum__P0%2C17__Orightresult__X1;jsessionid=4912A4D75A4FD6B390E943219B91FEC2?lang=eng&amp;suite=mobum-sso |title=Robert Rosenblum selected writings on Andy Warhol and other artists|last=Rosenblum|first=R|date=1999|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Geralyn Huxley, curator of film and video at the [[The Andy Warhol Museum|Andy Warhol Museum]] in Pittsburgh, believes Warhol's preoccupation with celebrity portraits and the style in which he depicts them, stems from the artist's religious upbringing. As a child Warhol attended a local Catholic church which featured an [[iconostasis]], a screen situated in front of the altar featuring large-scale depictions of the faces of the [[Saint]]s.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Andy-Warhol-Treasures-Geralyn-Huxley/dp/1847960049|title=Andy Warhol Treasures|last=Huxley|first=Geralyn|last2=Wrbican|first2=Matt|date=2009-05-14|publisher=Goodman Books|isbn=9781847960047|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian Jane Daggett Dillenberger, in her book ''The Religious Art of Andy Warhol'', points out that Warhol's portraits of celebrities have a strong affinity with the sacred icons at the [[St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church]] in Pittsburgh: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Andy's earliest experience of art was of religious art...for Andy, art and religion were linked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Religious-Art-Andy-Warhol/dp/082641334X |title=The Religious Art of Andy Warhol |last=Dillenberger |first=Jane Daggett |date=2001-05-10 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd. |isbn=9780826413345 |location=New York; London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his New York Times review of the 1989 Warhol retrospective exhibition at [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]], art critic Michael Brenson says that Warhol's portraits, at their best, bring together diametrically opposite values, such as sensual excess and the purity of an icon, as seen in the portrait of Prince:&lt;blockquote&gt;“[Andy Warhol's] flat images, painted in a flat tone, existing in a non-space from which past and future have been banished ... make the present seem absolute and eternal—in other words, transcendent. Part of Warhol’s achievement was to legitimize his love of secular, profane subjects by attaching to them traditional religious values. ... Warhol argues that self-effacement and sensual excess, purity and trash, the moment and eternity can exist together.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/03/arts/review-art-looking-back-at-warhol-stars-super-heroes-and-all.html|title=Review/Art; Looking Back at Warhol, Stars, Super-Heroes and All|last=Brenson|first=Michael|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Publications ==
''Orange Prince'' painting has been reproduced in books, magazines and other media, most notably as the cover of a commemorative magazine published by [[Condé Nast]] just after Prince's death in 2016.

=== ''Vanity Fair'' ===
The portrait was featured in both the November 1984 and the April 2016 editions of [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']], reproduced in color on a full page to illustrate the article entitled ''Purple Fame'', about Prince's rise to fame in the wake of his celebrated [[1984]] album and movie ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]],'' the inspiration for Warhol's portrait.

The ''Vanity Fair'' article claims that Warhol's portrait of Prince captures the recording artist "...at the height of his powers"&lt;ref name="CondeNast"&gt;{{Cite magazine|date=2016|title=The Genius of Prince|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Genius-of-Prince/dp/B01F27Q48M|magazine=Condé Nast}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the first global pieces written as a critical appreciation of the musician, coinciding with the start of the recording artist's 98-date [[Purple Rain Tour]]. ''Purple Rain'' is frequently regarded as Prince's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]; declaring that Prince had "...finally arrived", and Warhol's portrait shows Prince as a confident and celebrated musician, now on a world stage and internationally renowned.

=== ''The Genius of Prince'' ===
''Orange Prince (1984)'' was reproduced on the front cover of ''The Genius of Prince'', a commemorative magazine published in the wake of the musician's sudden death just months before. The magazine was published as a US edition by [[Condé Nast]], in June 2016, to wide acclaim and distributed internationally.&lt;ref name=CondeNast/&gt;

=== ''Andy Warhol Treasures'' ===
The portrait also features in ''Andy Warhol Treasures'', a book published in 2009 by Geralyn Huxley.&lt;ref name="Amazon" /&gt;

[[File:SolwayfirthSpaceman.jpg|thumb|Jim Templeton's photograph]]

The '''Solway Firth Spaceman''' (also known as the '''Solway Spaceman''' or the '''Cumberland Spaceman''') is a figure seen in a photograph taken in 1964 by fireman, photographer and local historian Jim Templeton (13 February 1920 – 27 November 2011).

The picture was taken on Burgh Marsh, situated near [[Burgh by Sands]], overlooking the [[Solway Firth]] in [[Cumbria]], [[England]]. Templeton claimed the photograph shows a background figure wearing a [[space suit]] and insisted that he did not see anyone present when the photograph was taken. The image was reproduced widely in contemporary newspapers&lt;ref name="Lytollis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/features/e-t-phone-cumbria-1.76788 |title=E.T.

A contemporary analysis concluded that the figure was the photographer's wife, standing with her back towards the camera, her dress appearing white due to [[overexposure]].&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

==Photograph==
On 23 May 1964, Jim Templeton, a [[firefighter]] from [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Cumberland]] (now part of [[Cumbria]]), took three photographs of his five-year-old daughter while on a day trip to Burgh Marsh.&lt;ref name="Lytollis"/&gt; Templeton said the only other people on the marshes that day were a couple of old women sitting in a car at the far end of the marsh. In a letter to the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in 2002, Templeton stated, "I took three pictures of my daughter Elizabeth in a similar pose – and was shocked when the middle picture came back from [[Kodak]] displaying what looks like a spaceman in the background."&lt;ref name="dm"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Templeton|first=James|date=13 December 2002|title=Photographer Comments on Cumberland Spaceman Picture|journal=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[DMG Media|Associated Newspapers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Templeton insists that he did not see the figure until after his photographs were developed, and analysts at Kodak confirmed that the photograph was genuine.&lt;ref name="Lytollis" /&gt;

===Explanation of the "spaceman"===
According to UFO author [[David Clarke (journalist)|David Clarke]] in 2014, the "spaceman" is most likely Templeton's wife, Annie, who was present at the time and was seen on other photographs taken that day. "I think for some reason his wife walked into the shot and he didn't see her because with that particular make of camera you could only see 70% of what was in the shot through the viewfinder", said Clarke. Annie Templeton was wearing a pale blue dress on the day in question, which was overexposed as white in the other photos; she also had dark bobbed hair. It has been argued that, when using photo software to darken the image and straighten the horizon, the figure increasingly appears to be a regular person viewed from behind.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-27391210 |title=The mystery of the Solway Spaceman |last1=Armstrong |first1=Simon |last2= |first2= |date=23 May 2014 |website=BBC News |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteanTimes&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Andy|author2=Dr. David Clarke |title=Solway Spaceman Solved?|journal=[[Fortean Times]]|date=September 2013|issue=305|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of its impact, Clarke said: "People will still be talking about it in another 50 years."&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

==Publicity==
Templeton stated, "I took the picture to the police in Carlisle who, after many doubts, examined it and stated there was nothing suspicious about it. The local newspaper, the ''Cumberland News'', picked up the story and within hours it was all over the world. The picture is certainly not a fake, and I am as bemused as anyone else as to how this figure appeared in the background. Over the four decades the photo has been in the public domain, I have had many thousands of letters from all over the world with various ideas or possibilities – most of which make little sense to me."&lt;ref name="dm"/&gt;

Templeton said that after the photograph was published he was visited by two [[Men in Black|men who said they were from the government]] who refused to show their identification and that "They said they worked for the government and that they were only identified by number."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Men+in+Black+are+real.-a061067536|title=The Men in Black are real|publisher=[[The Free Library]]|website=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=16 September 1997|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After taking the men to the site where the photos were taken, Templeton said that when he explained he had not seen the figure at the time, the men became angry and drove away, leaving him to walk home.&lt;ref name="Lytollis" /&gt; In September 1964, Templeton dismissed the two men as frauds, saying: "It all looks like a [[Practical joke|leg pull]] to me. I'm sure the men were not security agents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=4 September 1964|title=Security meeting on marsh 'a joke'|journal=The Cumberland News|publisher=[[CN Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''BBC Look North'' interview and a letter to ''The Daily Mail'', Templeton also said that a [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] missile launch at the [[Woomera Test Range]] in [[South Australia]] had been aborted because the figures of two large men were seen on the firing range. He alleged that technicians later saw his photograph in an Australian newspaper and found the figures to be exactly the same.&lt;ref name="bbclooknorth"&gt;{{cite episode |title= Jim Templeton interview|episodelink= |series= [[BBC Look North (North East and Cumbria)|BBC Look North]]|serieslink= |credits= |network= [[BBC]]|station= [[BBC One]]|airdate= 10 January 2008|season= |seriesno= |number= 1/1|minutes= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to a request from ufologists to know if the photo was of interest to the authorities, a British [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] official said that the Templeton photo was of no interest to them.&lt;ref name=News&amp;Star&gt;{{cite news|title=Government not doing enough to investigate sightings, says Cumbrian UFO expert|url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/features/government-not-doing-enough-to-investigate-sightings-says-cumbrian-ufo-expert-1.867552?referrerPath=news/updated_city_council_agrees_airport_expansion_plan|accessdate=29 August 2011|newspaper=[[News &amp; Star]]|date=13 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824164134/http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/features/government-not-doing-enough-to-investigate-sightings-says-cumbrian-ufo-expert-1.867552?referrerPath=news%2Fupdated_city_council_agrees_airport_expansion_plan|archivedate=24 August 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spaceship Earth''''' is a 350,000-pound Brazilian blue [[quartzite]] sculpture created by Finnish American artist [[Eino]].&lt;ref name='Birth'&gt;{{cite news | first=Angela | last=Hill | title=175-ton East Bay-inspired 'Earth Spaceship' needs landing pad | date=2007-03-24 | publisher=MediaNews Group, Inc. | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =Alameda Times-Star | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculpture was commissioned by Brian Maxwell of [[Powerbar]] the Maxwell Family Foundation for the late environmentalist [[David Brower]] and its name was often used by Brower referring to mankind traveling through life in a common vehicle.&lt;ref name='possible'&gt;{{cite news | first=Kristin | last=Bender | title=Artist's tribute may get a home;Berkeley Marina probable site for 'Spaceship Earth,' a memorial | date=2004-07-12 | publisher=MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =Alameda Times-Star | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the sculpture is located at [[Kennesaw State University]] adjacent to the Social Science building, the first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified building at the [[University System of Georgia]].&lt;ref name='kennesaw'&gt;{{cite news | first=Stacey | last=Moore | title=Spaceship Earth sculpture unveiled | date=2006-10-30 | publisher=[[Kennesaw State University]] | url=http://acsdevl.kennesaw.edu/access/story.asp?sto=340 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20070620001812/http://acsdevl.kennesaw.edu/access/story.asp?sto=340 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2007-06-20 | work=Access Online | accessdate=2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 175-ton chunk of rock was formed from 88 individual pieces of [[quartzite]] and bonded with specially made [[polyepoxide]].&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt;&lt;ref name='kennesaw' /&gt;  After these pieces were in place, Eino attached a life-size bronze model of the late Brower.  Additionally, 2,400 bronze pieces were added to the exterior to outline land masses on the earth.&lt;ref name='kennesaw' /&gt;

''Spaceship Earth'' was completed in August 2006 and unveiled in October.&lt;ref name='kennesaw' /&gt;  The sculpture broke apart and started spilling over just two months later.  First reports cited poor adhesive and unsound construction contributed to its demise while Eino argued that it had to have been an act of vandalism.  The sculpture was rededicated in November 2006.&lt;ref name='collapse'&gt;{{cite news | title=Earth Collapses | publisher =[[Associated Press]] | url =http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/bizarre&amp;id=5723603 | accessdate = 2009-12-31 | date = 2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

A few months before the November 2000 death of the first Executive Director [[Sierra Club]] and lifelong environmentalist David Brower, the founders of [[PowerBar]], Brian and Jennifer Maxwell,  commissioned the 175-ton tribute in his honor.&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt; It was during a morning run with photographer Galen Rowell and PowerBar's Brian Maxwell that the tribute was conceived.&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt;  Shortly after Maxwell met with his friend, environmentalist and Finnish-American artist Eino, to create such a sculpture.&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt;

Eino was sent stone samples from a rock quarry in Brazil at the start of the project and "[he] thought, oh my, this is three times harder than marble. But immediately I understood this was the right stone. It is more permanent than anything else. No pollution can hurt it. No graffiti will harm it. It was the right stone to be here for 1,000 years."&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt; Over 175 tons of Brazilian blue quartzite was shipped and stored in a parking lot while Eino and Maxwell sought to secure a home for the sculpture.&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt;  Locations in Berkeley to Washington, D.C., were proposed, but all were turned down by local art commissions or city councils.&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Halted' /&gt;  For nearly a year, Eino argued to have the sculpture placed in the streets of San Francisco, but the San Francisco Arts Commission’s Visual Arts Committee turned it down by saying it "not only had little or nothing to do with the city" but "was too big and did not represent Brower's ideals."&lt;ref name='Finding'&gt;{{cite news | first=Leah | last=Garchik | title=175-ton East Bay-inspired 'Earth Spaceship' needs landing pad | date=2003-08-13 | publisher=The Chronicle Publishing Co. | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work = The San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Home' /&gt;

Later, in 2004, Jennifer Maxwell, then the widow of Brian Maxwell, contacted the City of Berkeley to find a home for the tribute.&lt;ref name='sleepwalking'&gt;{{cite news | first=Ken | last=Coupland | title=Spaceship Earth Tries to Land A sleepwalking David Brower sculpture looks for a home | date=2004-09-15 | publisher=East Bay Express Publishing, LP | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =East Bay Express | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few members of the Berkeley Arts Commission spoke out against the sculpture's design and how it seemed to be forced on the city.  In October 2004, the commission voted 7-2 to accept the sculpture with conditions.&lt;ref name='altered'&gt;{{cite news | first=Patrick | last=Hoge | title=Panel OKs accepting altered sculpture | date=2004-10-30 | publisher=The Chronicle Publishing Co. | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work = The San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For final approval by the Civic Art Commission {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} sculpture could not be adorned with the bronze statue of Brower, and the Maxwell family had to pay the entire installation cost.&lt;ref name='Halted'&gt;{{cite news | first=Susan | last=Kuchinskas | title=Lost in Space | date=2005-08-03 | publisher=East Bay Express Publishing, LP | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =East Bay Express | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='altered' /&gt;  By 2005, with a push from the Mayor, the Civic Art Commission found nearly 30 different locations the sculpture could live.&lt;ref name='possible' /&gt;&lt;ref name='sleepwalking' /&gt; In August 2005, two Berkeley area commissions voted to consider another location.&lt;ref name='Halted' /&gt;  While negotiations were dragging on with bureaucrats in Berkeley, officials at [[Kennesaw State University]] contacted Eino and accepted the memorial.&lt;ref name='Home'&gt;{{cite news | title='Spaceship Earth' to land in Georgia | date=2005-11-04 | publisher=U.P.I. | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =UPI | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the sculpture resides at [[Kennesaw State University]], adjacent to the Social Science building.&lt;ref name='Home' /&gt; Nearly six years after its conception, Spaceship Earth was finished and unveiled on October 20, 2006.&lt;ref name='kennesaw' /&gt; In late December 2006, only three months after its installation on campus, ''Spaceship Earth'' collapsed. The sculpture was intended to be a permanent reminder to future generations to take care of their delicate planet. After the collapse, Eino attributed the disaster to vandalism, but later reports associated the collapse with poor construction. Reconstruction was to begin in February 2007 but was delayed until July and was completed by November 2007.&lt;ref name='collapse' /&gt;

'''Statuette of a Woman''' from the 6th to 5th centuries BC, is a bronze statue discovered in [[Ayrum]], [[Armenia]]. It is included in the [[History Museum of Armenia]]'s collection under the number 2225-1.

== Description ==
The figure is a miniature cast figure of a nude woman standing on the platform corner, with long legs, high hair, a flat face, and a large, straight nose. The eyes and ears are pronounced by round dimples. On her neck, she has on a thick necklace. Extended in her left hand, there is a pear-shaped jug, her right elbow is bent holding a [[drinking horn]]. Figures with forms of female deities, make use of [[temple]]s for various ritual ceremonies. The nude female statuettes were linked with the ritual belief of fertility and incorporated with the goddess [[Anahit]], who as a mother-goddess was also included in the [[Battle]], fertility, and functions of the goddess of love, being the [[gardening]], wheat, and patron goddess of [[animal]]s.

'''''The Garden''''' is [[Michael Nesmith]]'s 11th full studio album and was released in 1994. ''The Garden'' is a companion release to Nesmith's 1974 album/book, ''[[The Prison - A Book with a Soundtrack|The Prison]]''. Both ''The Garden'' and ''The Prison'' are written to have the music complement a novel included in the release (also written by Nesmith). ''The Prison'' and ''The Garden'' were re-released together on CD in 2004 by Video Ranch.

The idea is for listeners to read the novel while simultaneously listening to the recording.  Even though ''The Garden'' was released on Nesmith's record company, Rio Records, the novella/album concept was the driving force behind Nesmith's multimedia company [[Pacific Arts]].

In the liner notes, Nesmith states ''The Garden'' is not a sequel in the strictest sense of the term — meaning that there isn't a true continuation of the narrative which began in ''The Prison''. Instead, they are correlated thematically and stylistically as both are presented in a linear and consecutive approach. Each of ''The Garden's'' seven chapters are also visually enhanced, if not somewhat inspired by a series of Claude Monet paintings. There is a much more subtle connection between the prose and these unqualified masterworks, yet he is able to relate them in a contextual sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=michael nesmith|chart=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
{{Album ratings
|rev1 = [[Allmusic]]

}}&lt;!-- Automatically generated by DASHBot--&gt;

Allmusic writes "the music retains Nesmith's inimitable and signature sound, yet compared to his most concurrent effort, Tropical Campfires (1992), The Garden is exceedingly ethereal and more often than not instrumental. There are vocals that feature not only the artist, but also his children Jason — who is likewise the central character in the short story — Christian, and Jessica. The backing band also includes Christian Nesmith as well as most of the musicians the senior Nez had collaborated with on the aforementioned Tropical Campfires, most notably Desert Rose Band string man John Jorgenson (guitar/sax/bassoon/mandolin/oboe/bandurila/mandocello), Joe Chemay (bass), and John Hobbs (keyboards), as well as studio maven [[Sid Page]] (violin)".&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay Planer, Allmusic, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
According to the liner notes, the album was recorded at various times between October 1991 and September 1993 at Footprint Studios and Trax in [[Los Angeles]].  Additionally, ''The Garden'' is the first studio album Nesmith does not use a steel pedal guitar on any track.  

''The Garden'' novella features seven paintings of [[Claude Monet]] at the beginning of each chapter.

'''''The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons''''' ({{lang-fr|Les licteurs rapportent à Brutus les corps de ses fils}}) is a work in [[oil painting|oils]] by the [[France|French]] artist [[Jacques-Louis David]]. On a canvas of 146 square feet, this painting was first exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] in 1789. The subject is the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] leader [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], founder of the [[Roman Republic]], contemplating the fate of his sons. They had conspired to overthrow the republic and restore the monarchy, and Brutus himself was compelled to order their deaths. In doing so, Brutus became the heroic defender of the republic, at the cost of his own family. The painting was a bold allegory of [[civic virtue]] with immense resonance for the growing cause of [[republicanism]]. Its themes of virtue, sacrifice, and devotion to the nation sparked much controversy when it was unveiled in the politically charged era of the [[French Revolution]].

==Background==
David labored over the painting for more than two years before he considered it complete.&lt;ref name=Crow/&gt; His attachment to the motif of Brutus had been evident for years before this painting, at least since the early 1780s when he was making ''[[The Oath of the Horatii]]'' (1784). This earlier work bears a distinct connection to ''Brutus'' through the themes of duty, loyalty, and virtue.&lt;ref name=Crow/&gt; The oath itself was an element of the Brutus legend which David artistically transposed to the Horatii.&lt;ref name=Crow/&gt; Similar license was taken with the composition of ''Brutus'': the return of the sons' bodies is an episode not found in the accounts of [[Livy]] and [[Plutarch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Reception Studies |last=Hardwick |first=Lorna  |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Oxford |isbn= 0198528655 |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKYSc5RDMncC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=The%20Lictors%20Bring%20to%20Brutus%20the%20Bodies%20of%20His%20Sons&amp;pg=PA24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David's enthusiasm for the republican cause, at least at this early stage, is a matter of dispute. Many historians believe his painterly inspirations were more prosaic, drawn from standard classical history lessons and lesser events of contemporary notoriety.&lt;ref name=Donovan&gt;{{Cite book |title=Antoine Lavoisier: science, administration, and revolution |last=Donovan |first=Arthur |year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=052156672X |page=273 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0-fOasz2GUMC&amp;lpg=PA273&amp;dq=The%20Lictors%20Bring%20to%20Brutus%20the%20Bodies%20of%20His%20Sons&amp;pg=PA273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of its quick apotheosis by the public, some contemporaries questioned the personal intentions of David regarding this work, and the debate remains unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Jacques-Louis David |last=Brookner |first=Anita |authorlink=Anita Brookner |year=1980 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn=0064305074 |page=90 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Composition==
Like most of David's works, ''Brutus'' is on a large canvas. It measures {{convert|323|cm|in}} in height and {{convert|422|cm|in}} in width.&lt;ref name="Louvre"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cartelen.louvre.fr/cartelen/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=22498&amp;langue=en |title=Atlas database of exhibits: The Lictors... |author= |date=2018 |publisher=The Louvre |website= |accessdate=15 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of painting is in the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] manner. Brutus sits on a [[klismos]] on the left, alone and brooding; to the right, his wife holds their two horrified daughters, while a servant on the far right quakes in anguish.

Note Brutus' tense crossed feet in the picture, the sharp scissors that lay dead in the center of the painting, and the use of light and dark to draw a distinction between Brutus and his wife. Brutus does not even look back as his headless sons are brought into the room.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt; [[Simon Schama|Schama, Simon]]. BBC documentary series: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/powerofart/david.shtml ''The Power of Art''].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presentation==
The name is frequently rendered in English as '''''Brutus Receiving the Bodies of His Sons''''', among other variations, including '''''Brutus and His Dead Sons''''' and simply '''''Brutus'''''. The complete original name as presented to the Salon was much lengthier and more explicative. It too has been rendered in various forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/neocl_dav_brutus.html |title=Jacques-Louis David, ''The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons'' |author= |date= |publisher=Boston College Fine Arts Department |accessdate=19 January 2011 |quote=Brutus Returning Home after Having Sentenced His Sons for Plotting a Tarquinian Restoration and Conspiring against Roman Freedom; the Lictors Bring their Bodies to be Buried.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as translated from the small Salon guidebook (''livret'') offered in 1789, it reads, with poignancy in the first year of the Revolution, as: '''''Brutus, first consul, returned to his house after having condemned his two sons who had allied themselves with the Tarquins and conspired against Roman liberty; the lictors return their bodies so that they may be entombed'''''.&lt;ref name=Crow&gt;{{Cite book |title=Painters and public life in eighteenth-century Paris |last=Crow |first=Thomas E. |authorlink=Thomas E. Crow |year=1985 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, CT |isbn=0300037643 |pages=248–253 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9d00YdKSsmQC&amp;lpg=PA248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The work had tremendous resonance for the time. The Revolution had already begun, and all paintings shown at the Salon had to be approved for political acceptability. [[Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and his wife|David’s 1788 portrait]] of [[Antoine Lavoisier]] had already been refused a display because the famed chemist was a potentially divisive figure, tied as he was to the [[Ancien Régime]].&lt;ref name=Donovan/&gt; Out of similar caution, ''The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons'' was almost not shown because of concerns about inflaming pro-revolutionary passions. The public's insistence was too great, however, and the authorities were forced to give in.&lt;ref name=Donovan/&gt;

After its first exhibition, David's friend, the actor [[François-Joseph Talma]], played the title role in [[Voltaire]]'s ''Brutus'' and added in a scene in which the stage direction exactly replicated the composition of the already famous painting.&lt;ref name="Schama"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution |last=Schama |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Schama |year=1989 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |page=564 |isbn=0679726101 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Contemporaneously with David, the painter [[Angelica Kauffmann]] (1741–1807) was commissioned by Polish royalty to create a work she entitled ''Brutus Condemning His Sons to Death for Treason''. This painting, now lost, is known only by written description and a preparatory pen and ink drawing from 1788.&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;{{Cite book |title=Femininity and masculinity in eighteenth-century art and culture |author1-last=Perry |author1-first=Gillian |author2-last=Rossington |author2-first=Michael |author3-last=Roworth |author3-first=Wendy Wassyng |year=1994 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester UK |isbn=0719042283 |pages=53–54 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HciUKoMSzjoC&amp;lpg=PA55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons'' is on permanent display in [[the Louvre]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Louvre"/&gt; A study in ink and chalk from 1787 is housed in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2006.264/ |title=Study for The Lictors Bringing Brutus the Bodies of his Sons |author= |date=2018 |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |website= |accessdate=15 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mystical Nativity''''' is a painting of circa 1500–1501 by the Italian [[Renaissance]] master [[Sandro Botticelli]], in the [[National Gallery]] in London. Botticelli built up the image using [[oil]] on canvas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sandro-botticelli-mystic-nativity/*/key-facts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Featherstone, [[Hamilton Kerr Institute]], Cambridge, speaking on ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece|The Private Life of a Christmas Masterpiece]]'', BBC 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is his only signed work, and has an unusual [[iconography]] for a [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]].

The Greek inscription at the top translates as: "This picture, at the end of the year 1500, in the troubles of Italy, I Alessandro, in the half-time after the time, painted, according to the eleventh [chapter] of [[Book of Revelation|Saint John]], in the second woe of the Apocalypse, during the release of the devil for three-and-a-half years; then he shall be bound in the twelfth [chapter] and we shall see [him buried] as in this picture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG1034 National Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; Botticelli believed himself to be living during the Tribulation, possibly due to the upheavals in Europe at the time, and was predicting Christ's Millennium as stated in Biblical text.

It has been suggested that the painting may be connected with the influence of [[Girolamo Savonarola|Savonarola]], whose influence appears in a number of late paintings by Botticelli,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/pss/751506 Botticelli's ''Mystic Nativity'', Savonarola and the Millennium]" by Rab Hatfield in ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', vol.&amp;nbsp;58, 1995 {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece]]''&lt;/ref&gt; though the contents of the image may have been specified by the person commissioning it. The painting uses the medieval convention of showing the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and infant [[Jesus]] larger both than other figures, and their surroundings; this was certainly done deliberately for effect, as earlier Botticellis use correct [[Perspective (graphical)|graphical perspective]].

==Historical context and puzzling aspects==
''The Mystical Nativity'' depicts a scene of joy and celebration, of earthly and heavenly delight, with angels dancing at the top of the painting. At the top of the painting stands Sandro Botticelli's name – but also the apocalyptic and troubling words. And there are dark premonitions – the helpless child rests on a sheet that evokes the shroud in which his body will one day be wrapped, while the cave in which the scene is set calls to mind his tomb. The Kings on the left bear no gifts, but their own devotion. At the top of the painting twelve angels dressed in the colours of [[1 Corinthians 13|faith, hope and charity]] dance in a circle holding olive branches, and above them heaven opens in a great golden dome, while at the bottom of the painting three angels embrace three men, seeming to raise them up from the ground. They hold scrolls which proclaim in Latin, "peace on earth to men of goodwill". Behind them seven devils flee to the underworld, some impaled on their own weapons. In Renaissance times [[Last Judgment]] paintings showed viewers the reckoning of the damned and the saved at the time of Christ's [[Second Coming of Christ|Second Coming]]. In echoing this kind of painting the Mystical Nativity is asking us to think not only of Christ's birth but of his return.." (Jonathan Nelson, Syracuse University in Florence).

The painting emerged from the city of Florence in a time when the fanatical preacher Savonarola held the city in its grip. He had arrived in Florence in 1490 but had been repelled by the artistic glory and enormous wealth that so impressed the world. He preached that this was a corrupt and vice-ridden place. A great scourge was approaching – and then his words had assumed a terrifying reality: the [[Italian War of 1494–1498]]. In 1494 a huge French army invaded Italy and {{FORMATNUM:10000}} troops entered Florence so that the Florentines feared the King of France meant to sack the city. Savonarola stepped into the political vacuum, he met with the French king and persuaded him to leave Florence peacefully. In their gratitude and relief the Florentines increasingly saw the friar as a [[prophet]] and his preaching attracted huge crowds to [[Florence Cathedral]]. Savonarola claimed that Florence could become the new Jerusalem if the citizens would repent and abandon their sinful luxuries – and that included much of their art. His beliefs were made real as groups of evangelical youths went on to the streets to encourage people to part with their luxuries, their lewd pictures, and books, their vanities, combs, mirrors. Botticelli may well have seen his own paintings [[Bonfire of the Vanities|fed to the flames]]. Yet the artist might not have objected because, like much of the city, he too had come under the sway of Savonarola. It seems that a sermon preached by Savonarola bears directly upon the Mystical Nativity.
[[File:Santa Maria del Fiore.jpg|thumb|left|Savonarola's preaching attracted huge crowds to [[Florence Cathedral]] – like much of the city, Botticelli had come under his sway.]]
In one sermon Savonarola preached he set forth a vision that had come to him in which he saw an extraordinary heavenly crown. At its base were twelve hearts with twelve ribbons wrapped around them and written on these in Latin were the unique mystical qualities or privileges of the Virgin Mary – she is 'mother of her father', 'daughter of her son', 'bride of God' etc. Though much of the writing on the ribbons held by the dancing angels is now invisible to the naked eye, [[infra-red reflectography]] has shown that the original words on the angels ribbons correspond exactly to Savonarola's 12 privileges of the Virgin. In his sermon, preached on [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption Day]], Savonarola went on to explore the 11th and 12th chapters of the [[Book of Revelation]] – the precise chapters mentioned in the painting's inscription. He connected the glory of Mary with the imminent coming of the power of Christ on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Rab Hatfield, Syracuse University in Florence, speaking on ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece|The Private Life of a Christmas Masterpiece]]'', BBC TV 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Girolamo Savonarola.jpg|thumb|upright|In one sermon [[Savonarola]] preached, he set forth a vision that had come to him in which he saw an extraordinary heavenly crown. At its base were twelve hearts with twelve ribbons wrapped around them and written on these were the unique mystical qualities or privileges of the Virgin Mary.]]
For years Savonarola held Florence in his hand but his hard line charismatic rule made him powerful political enemies. He was challenged to prove his holiness by walking through fire and when he refused the tide of opinion turned against him. He was arrested, and under torture confessed to being a false prophet. On 23 May 1498 he was hanged with two of his leading lieutenants, their bodies burnt and their ashes scattered in the river [[Arno]]. Some see the figures of the three men at the bottom of the painting as representatives of the three executed holy men, raised up and restored to grace – but persecution not peace awaited Savonarola's followers and it was in an atmosphere of oppression that Botticelli set out to create the ''Mystical Nativity''.

The painting is on canvas – normally he would have used wood panel – perhaps for a painting with a dangerous message, canvas had the advantage that it could be rolled up and hidden. With his canvas prepared he would sketch a detailed design on paper, then he transferred this to canvas. He drew on many sources – the dancing angels echo his own three graces of ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'', the scurrying devil was inspired by a German woodcut. X-rays show that very little of the original design changed – only an angel's wing was adjusted and trees added over the roof of the stable. Botticelli was now ready to build up the image using tempera paint – the canvas was an experimental medium. To create the heavenly dome Botticelli called on the goldsmith's craft he had learned as a boy. "The symbolism of the gold is to do with the unchanging, untarnished nature of heaven – gold doesn't decay, it doesn't darken like silver. Botticelli would have used an adhesive layer made of oil mixed with [[resin]] – not burnished, the gold just patted down on to the surface, following the surface irregularities of the canvas – a glitter, intricate, it would have helped the jewel like quality of the painting – it would have drawn the eye upwards from the Nativity into Heaven. Faith, hope and charity, [the angels clothed in] white, green and red – but the copper based green pigment has discoloured with time, to bronze. Originally it would have been vibrant." &lt;ref&gt;Rupert Featherstone, speaking on ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece]]'', BBC TV December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate of the painting==
[[File:Rossetti-golden head.jpg|thumb|left|Rossetti was interested in figures locked in embrace; cf. the embracing figures at the bottom of the ''Mystical Nativity''.]]
Botticelli died in 1510. The ''Mystical Nativity'' remained hidden for another three centuries. Rome at the end of the 18th century was very different to Renaissance Florence – except for the presence of French invaders. Many foreigners left, but not a young Englishman, [[William Young Ottley]]. He was an art lover, and wealthy with a slave plantation in the Caribbean. He bought up many paintings cheaply. At the [[Villa Aldobrandini]] he saw a small, unknown work, Botticelli's ''Mystical Nativity''. Botticelli was then in obscurity.

It arrived in London where Ottley's house became in effect a private museum of Italian masterpieces. After Ottley's death [[William Fuller Maitland]] of Stansted picked up the painting at an auction for £80. When he loaned it to the [[Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857]], it was now on open display. The exhibition's newspaper the ''Art Treasures Examiner'' printed a new engraving of it.
[[File:Edward Burne-Jones The Golden Stairs.jpg|thumb|upright|"All those little toes that are climbing down the stairs – you can see the fascination with the patterns of the toes that are circling in the angels of the ''Mystical Nativity'' ... The ''Mystical Nativity'' worked a particular magic on members of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] circle." [[Edward Burne-Jones]]'s ''The Golden Stairs''&lt;ref&gt;[[Suzanne Fagence Cooper]], speaking on ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece|Private Life of a Christmas Masterpiece]]''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the moment Botticelli's art is shown in Manchester there's a real change in opinion about his work and certainly by the late 1870s, 1880s Botticelli becomes a real cult figure – somebody the artists who aspire to be on the cutting edge of the art world are looking to...[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] both adapted elements of it for their own work. Burne-Jones copied some of Botticelli's illustrations for [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' into his own sketchbooks. Rossetti demonstrated his affection for Botticelli's work by buying his portrait of ''[[Portrait of a Lady known as Esmeralda Brandini|Smeralda Bandinelli]]'' in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Fagence Cooper, speaking on the BBC programme ''[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece]]'' and ''Pre-Raphaelite Art in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A]]'', V&amp;A Publications 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Ruskin]] helped to give the painting its name; after seeing it in London he referred to Botticelli's 'mystic symbolism'. When Maitland died the [[National Gallery]] in London stepped in. According to [[Nicholas Penny]] the Gallery "was concerned to buy works from the earlier Renaissance – previously it had been its top priority to buy masterpieces which there would be no controversy about at all. There was an element of avant-garde excitement about buying pictures like this in the 19th century." The Gallery had to find £1500, being nearly 20 times what it had fetched just thirty years earlier.

{{nihongo|'''''The Seashell Game'''''|貝おほひ|''Kai Ōi''}} is a 1672 [[anthology]] compiled by Japanese poet [[Matsuo Bashō]], in which each [[haiku]] is followed by [[literary criticism|critical commentary]] he made as referee for a haiku contest.&lt;ref name="jestice"&gt;Jestice, Phyllis G. (2004). ''Holy people of the world: a cross-cultural encyclopedia.'' ABC-CLIO, {{ISBN|978-1-57607-355-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is Bashō's earliest known book, and the only book he published in his own name.&lt;ref name="ueda"&gt;Ueda, Makoto (1970). ''Twayne's World Authors Series.'' Twayne Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ueda2"&gt;Ueda, Makoto (1982). ''Matsuo Bashō''. Kodansha, {{ISBN|0-87011-553-7}} p148&lt;/ref&gt; The work contains 60 haiku by 36 poets, including two by Bashō himself.&lt;ref name="ueda3"&gt;Ueda, Makoto (1992). ''Bashō and his Interpreters''. Stanford University Press, {{ISBN|0-8047-2526-8}} p29&lt;/ref&gt;

The format is based on a [[List of traditional children's games|children's game]] where two seashells were placed side by side and compared. Bashō compares pairs of haiku by different authors in the same manner in the book. According to scholar [[Sam Hamill]], ''The Seashell Game'' shows Bashō "to be witty, deeply knowledgeable, and rather light-hearted."&lt;ref name="Hamill"&gt;Hamill, Sam (2008). ''A poet's work: the other side of poetry.'' Carnegie Mellon University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-88748-225-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Bashō compares the following pair of verses on the topic of colourful autumn leaves:

:How like it is to
:A midwife's right hand–
:Crimson maple leaf!
:—''Sanboku''

:"I haven't crimsoned.
:Come and look!" So says the dew
:On an oak branch
:—''Dasoku''

In his commentary, Bashō declares that the first poem "ranks thousands of leagues" above the second.&lt;ref name="ueda2" /&gt;

'''''Thrilling Adventures''''' was a monthly American [[pulp magazine]] published from 1931 to 1943.&lt;ref name=ah&gt;Doug Ellis, John Locke, John Gunnison, ''The Adventure House Guide to the Pulps''. Adventure House, 2000,  {{ISBN|1886937451}} (p. 270).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Thrilling Adventures'' was created in 1931 by editor [[Leo Margulies]]&lt;ref name=pfest&gt;{{cite news|title=Leo Margulies at 115!|url=http://www.pulpfest.com/2015/06/leo-margulies-at-115/|accessdate=13 December 2015|work=Pulpfest|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was patterned after the pulp [[Adventure (magazine)|''Adventure'']]. It was one of 16 pulps that Margulies founded that incorporated the adjective "Thrilling" in the title. (The company that published the ''Thrilling'' titles eventually changed its name to [[Thrilling Publications]].)&lt;ref name=pfest/&gt; The first edition of ''Thrilling Adventures'' was published in December 1931.

''Thrilling Adventures'' published fictional stories, mostly of the adventure and sports genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Dinan|title=Sports in the Pulp Magazines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LvwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55|accessdate=13 December 2015|date=1 September 1998|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-1-4766-0767-2|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued as a monthly until 1943, when it was reduced to a bimonthly, and the final issue was the November 1943 edition.&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt; A total of 139 issues were published during its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thrilling Adventures|url=http://www.pulpmags.org/thrilling_page.html|work=The Pulp Magazines Project|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|a French canvas fabric|the French netting fabric|Tulle (netting)}}
&lt;!--Toilet can be misspelled as "toile"--&gt;
[[Image:Toile de jouy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A photo of toile de jouy fabric on a French reproduction style chair.]]
'''Toile''' is a fabric, from the [[French language|French]] word meaning "linen cloth" or "canvas", particularly cloth or canvas for painting on. The word "toile" can refer to the fabric itself, a test garment (generally) sewn from the same material, or a type of repeated surface decoration (traditionally) printed on the same fabric. The term entered the [[English language]] around the 12th century.&lt;ref name="OEDtoile"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'': "toile"; earliest citation from 1561.  Also spelled ''toyl'' / ''toyle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Middle English]] toile, from [[French language|French]] ''toile'' ("cloth"), from [[Old French]] ''teile'', from [[Latin]] ''tela'' ("web"), from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*(s)teg'' ("to cover") (see [[wiktionary:Appendix:List of Proto-Indo-European roots|List of Proto-Indo-European roots]] in [[Wiktionary]]).

==Uses==

===Test garment===
In Australian and British terminology, a "toile" is a version of a garment made by a fashion designer or [[dressmaker]] to test a [[pattern (sewing)|pattern]]. They are usually made in cheap material, as multiple toiles may be made in the process of perfecting a design. Toiles are sometimes referred to as "[[muslin]]s" in the United States, named for the cheap, unbleached cotton fabric available in different weights.

===Toile de Jouy===
"Toile de Jouy", sometimes abbreviated to simply "toile", is a type of decorating pattern consisting of a white or off-white background on which a repeated pattern depicting a fairly complex scene, generally of a pastoral theme such as a couple having a picnic by a lake or an arrangement of flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = toile de Jouy | work = Art &amp;amp; Architecture Thesaurus | publisher = The J. Paul Getty Trust | date =  | url = http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=Toiles&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300231747 | doi = | accessdate = April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern portion consists of a single color, most often black, dark red, or blue.  Greens, browns, and magenta toile patterns are less common, but not unheard of.  Toile is most associated with fabrics (curtains and upholstery in particular, especially chintz), though toile wallpaper is also popular. Toile can also be used on teapots, beddings, clothing, etc.  In upper-class (primarily American, but also northern European) society, toile is often seen on dresses or aprons used at such events as country-themed garden parties or tea parties.

Toiles were originally produced in Ireland in the mid-18th Century and quickly became popular in Britain and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fabricmuseum.org/American_Toile.html |title=American Toile |publisher=Fabricmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term, Toile de Jouy, originated in [[France]] in the late 18th century. In the [[French language]], the phrase literally means "cloth from [[Jouy-en-Josas]]", a town in the south-west suburbs of [[Paris]].

Although it has been continuously produced since then, it experienced a marked upsurge in popularity around the year 2000.  Previously only a decorating design, designers have been recently experimenting with toile-patterned apparel as well, although toile-patterned shirts were widely worn in the 1970s.

Toiles were very popular during the [[Thirteen Colonies|Colonial Era in the United States]] and are highly associated with preservationist towns and historical areas such as  [[Colonial Williamsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.org |title=Colonial Williamsburg Official History Site |publisher=History.org |date=2009-11-05 |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Williamsburg saw a repopularization in the 1930s, so did toiles, as they did again in the 1970s in celebration of the [[United States Bicentennial]]. Since then many other companies have subverted to using toile in their designs an example being [[Timorous Beasties]].

'''Toquepala Caves''' are located near [[Toquepala mine]], about {{Convert|154|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city of [[Tacna]], in the extreme southeast of [[Peru]]. They are notable for a number of rock paintings. The best known of them is the cave named ''Abrigo del Diablo'' ("Devil's rock face").

== Geography ==
Situated in the western [[Andes]], they are in the [[Moquegua Region]] of the [[Osmore River]]. Located at an elevation of {{Convert|2200|m|abbr=on}} ({{Convert|2800|m|abbr=on}} is also mentioned in another source{{Sfn|Aldenderfer|1998|pp=56–57}}), they are two small caves each {{Convert|15|x|5|m|abbr=on}} in size, with a depth of {{Convert|5|m|abbr=on}}. The two Toquepala Caves in the high Sierra are located near the [[Quebrada Cimarron]] or along the Rio Locumba, which is a dry stream flowing from the Sierra to the desert.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt; The best known of the caves is "Abrigo del Diablo".{{sfn|Whitley|2001|p=712}}

== History ==
The caves were seasonally occupied.{{sfn|Dillehay|2008|p=180}} The art attained its peak when the [[Collawa]] ethnic group lived here during the [[Paleolithic]] or [[Stone Age]] period.&lt;ref name="Ruiz1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gonzalo de Reparaz Ruiz|title=Guide to Peru: Handbook for Travelers with Compact Tourist Atlas of Peru|page=221|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkZKAAAAYAAJ|year=1970|publisher=Ediciones de Arte Rep}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological research in the region revolved around the [[Asana]] site, as well as the Middle Horizon (500-1000AD) and the lower valley pre-Hispanic sites.{{Sfn|Rice|2011|p=67}} Important archaic caves discovered in the [[Osmore River]] Basin were the Toquepala Caves. This cave became famous after [[copper]] was found in the valley and South Peru Copper Corporation started exploration of the [[Cuajone]] mines.{{Sfn|Aldenderfer|1998|pp=56–57}} The cave was studied in 1963 at the initiative of South Peru Copper Corporation. They found a large cache of artifacts during their mining operations and funded the study of the paintings in the caves by archeologists from Lima.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt;) The team was led by Jorge C. Muelle, Director of the [[Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia del Perú]] which resulted in the discovery of the rupestral art (drawings inscribed on rocks in the caves).{{Sfn|Aldenderfer|1998|pp=56–57}}

The detailed exploration of the caves was undertaken by Roger Ravines of the Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia del Perú in 1965.{{Sfn|Aldenderfer|1998|pp=56–57}} Excavations from a pit dug to a depth of {{Convert|1.8|m}} was subject to radio carbon testing. The investigations revealed [[Aceramic|pre-ceramic]] habitation of the caves dated to 7,650 BC (10,000 BC is also mentioned). In one pit, remnants of paints along with brush wood were found at the same depth. He published his findings in 1965.{{Sfn|Aldenderfer|1998|p=56-57}} During the investigations, a fence was erected around the caves to prevent intruders from vandalizing the rock paintings. In spite of this measure there were incidents of surreptitious entry to the caves in which some of the rock paintings were damaged. Since then stronger security fencing has been arranged.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt;

== Features ==
The caves have rock art of gatherer-hunters who are inferred to have lived in the caves about 10,000 years ago.  There are more than 50 rock paintings drawn by the inhabitants of the caves of the Palaeolithic age of which 30 were studied.  These scenes depict armed men hunting the  [[guanaco]] cameloid and Andean religious symbols. The figures drawn are of animals, predominantly guanacos (cameloids). The scene depicted is of hunting by the humans who are corralling and killing a group of guanacos. The humans are in a posture of attacking the animals with [[axe]], [[lance]]s, and [[spear thrower]]s. However, bow and arrow are not part of these scenes of rock art.&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/fieldmuseumofnat53chic/fieldmuseumofnat53chic_djvu.txt|title=Field Museum of Natural History Bulletin|accessdate=6 July 2013|publisher=Archive organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitley2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=David S.

'''Translation criticism''' is  the systematic study, [[evaluation]], and [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of different aspects of translated works.&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sid.ir/en/ViewPaper.asp?ID=44700&amp;varStr=3.14159265358979;TAQIYEH%20M.H.;TRANSLATION%20STUDIES;Fall%202005;3;11;53;61|title=What is translation criticism?|accessdate=21 April 2013|publisher=Scientific Information Database|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227142628/http://www.sid.ir/en/ViewPaper.asp?ID=44700&amp;varStr=3.14159265358979;TAQIYEH%20M.H.;TRANSLATION%20STUDIES;Fall%202005;3;11;53;61|archivedate=27 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[interdisciplinary]] academic field closely related to [[literary criticism]] and [[translation theory]]. It includes marking of student translations, and reviews of published translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cw.routledge.com/textbooks/translationstudies/data/samples/9780415584890.pdf  |publisher=Routledge |title=Translation Studies |accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept itself of "translation criticism" has the following meanings:
# Quality assessment of the [[target text]], especially of its semantic and pragmatic equivalence regarding the [[source text]].
# Assessment of the proceeding followed by the translator in order to translate the text.
# Part of translation science dealing basically with:
* nature and aims of translation criticism,
* considering the problems of translation criticism,
* defining valid criteria and proceedings for criticizing translation regarding its aims.&lt;ref name="zierer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/obra/la-critica-de-la-traduccion/ |last=Zierer |first=Ernesto |title=Translation Criticism |publisher=[[Instituto Cervantes]] |year=2012|accessdate=20 August 2017}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
One of the goals of translation criticism is to raise awareness of the delicacy involved in translation and to explore whether the translator has achieved their goals or not. Whether or not translation criticism should be considered a separate field of inquiry from [[translation theory]] is a matter of some controversy.&lt;ref name="zierer"/&gt;

The translation professionals and laymen who engage in [[literary translation]] inevitably face the issue of translation quality. Translation criticism has several open issues, such as the name for the practice of evaluating translations, and the criteria for evaluation, each of which merits a detailed study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.nbuv.gov.ua/portal/natural/nvvnu/filolog_mov/2010_9/R4/Shpak.pdf|title=Toward Translation Criticism|author=Y. L. Shpak|accessdate=21 April 2013}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A literary text may be explored as a translation, not primarily to judge it, but to understand where the text stands in relation to its original by examining the interpretative potential that results from the translational choices that have been made. When comparing different translations from a same original text, the results of the analyses should be used to construct a hypothesis about each translation: criteria such as "divergent similarity", "relative divergence", "radical divergence" and "adaptation" are important for such an analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benjamins.com/#catalog/books/btl.95/main |title=An Approach to Translation Criticism|author=[[Lance Hewson]]|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very influential author in the field was [[Antoine Berman]], who claimed that there may be many different methods for translation criticism as there are many translation theories; therefore he entitled a model of his own as an analytical path, which can be modulated according to the specific objectives of each analyst and adapted to all standardized text types. He further insists that every translator shall develop first a [[translation project]], prior to the translation process itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/258112/EVALUATION_OF_THE_TRANSLATION_OF_VIRGINIA_WOOLFS_THE_DUCHESS_AND_THE_JEWELER_BY_ALEV_BULUT|title=Berman's approach to translation criticism in a given example|accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a debatable subject it can be said that translation criticism is required. For instance, in Turkey, since the establishment of the Translation Bureau in 1940, the Turkish literary system has been extensively enriched by translations from various languages and the translation activity has been evaluated by writers, translators and critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hewlett-Clarke|first1=Daniel|title=Translation Criticism|url=https://dhctranslations.com/translation-articles/|website=dhctranslations.com|publisher=Daniel Hewlett-Clarke|accessdate=16 January 2015}} See [https://dhctranslations.com/translation-articles/systemic-translation-criticism "A Systemic Analysis of Two Turkish Translations of Hemingway's The Old man and the Sea"].&lt;/ref&gt;A methodology for descriptive translation studies was put forward by Gideon Toury. In it he suggests that translators should constantly take decisions during the translation process. In short, scholars working within this paradigm have claimed that translations should be described in accordance with the target norms that are valid at a specific time and place and compared with their original ones in order to produce an objective translation criticism supported by translation theories (Toury 1980: 73).

A '''Wildenstein Index Number''' refers to an item in a numerical system published in catalogues by [[Daniel Wildenstein]], a scholar of [[Impressionism]], who published [[Catalogue raisonné|catalogues raisonnés]] of artists such as [[Claude Monet]], [[Édouard Manet]] and [[Paul Gauguin]] through his family business, Wildenstein &amp; Company. In these catalogues, each painting by an [[artist]] was assigned a unique number. These index numbers are now used throughout the art world, in art texts, and on art websites to uniquely identify specific [[work of art|works of art]] by specific artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artofmonet.com/Home_Page.htm|accessdate=October 9, 2007|publisher=artofmonet.com|title=Series and Themes (Home Page)  - Grain Stacks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TUM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Lemonedes, Heather, Lynn Federle Orr and David Steel, ''Monet in Normandy,'' Rizzoli International Publications, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-8478-2842-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example is the ''{{Lang|fr|Monet: Catalogue Raisonné}}'' ({{ISBN|978-3-8228-8559-8}}), which is a four volume set published in 1996 with 2,580 illustrations in 1,540 pages. In this set, volume I is a [[biography]] and volumes II-IV contain a chronological listing of Monet's work; that is to say, volume II contains Wildenstein Index #1 produced in 1858 through #968 produced in 1885. The catalogue is produced with text in [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]], and [[German language|German]]. The original version of this set was a five-volume black-and-white edition that has become [[collectible]] at costs of approximately U.S.$10,000 because it was originally only available to large [[museum]]s or major [[universities]]' art departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/3822885592|accessdate=October 9, 2007|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.|title=Monet: Catalogue Raisonné [BOX SET] (Hardcover)|author=Wildenstein, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original black-and-white version was published in 1974 in four volumes and had a 1991 supplementary volume of additional paintings as well as drawings and pastels.  The 1996 revised edition in multiple languages does not include pastels, drawings, letters or footnotes from the original edition. Thus, the original is the most valuable resource for scholars.&lt;ref name=TUM&gt;Ganz, James A. and Richard Kendall, ''The Unknown Monet: Pastels and Drawings,'' 2007, Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, {{ISBN|978-0-300-11862-9}}, p. XI.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;However, this gives the foundation an effective monopoly over deciding whether a work of art is a genuine Monet, or not. This has been called into question, as the Wildensteins are free to disregard the opinions of art experts and art historians worldwide if they so choose (as discussed in the BBC programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' broadcast by the [[BBC]] on June 19, 2011 referring to the painting ''{{Lang|fr|[[Bords de la Seine à Argenteuil]]}}'').  See: {{Cite episode| title = Monet| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0125bz7| accessdate = August 4, 2011| series = Fake or Fortune? | network = [[BBC]] | airdate = June 19, 2011| number = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most of the catalogues are published with Daniel as the author, other members of the five-generation family business were also responsible for promulgating this numbering system.  Daniel's father Georges Wildenstein published catalogues raisonnés for [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0571093140|accessdate=October 9, 2007|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.|title=Chardin: catalogue raisonne|author=Wildenstein, Georges}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000J2VI3W|accessdate=October 9, 2007|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.|title=The Paintings of Fragonard: Complete Edition with a Catalogue Raisonné and 350 Illustrations|author=Wildenstein, Georges}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His son, Alec, has published a catalogue for [[Odilon Redon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/2850472468|title=Odilon Redon: Catalogue Raisonne|author=Wildenstein, Alec|publisher=Amazon.com, Inc.|accessdate=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
