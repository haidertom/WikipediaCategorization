[[File:AeroplanctonAeroplanktonMeungSurLoire2010 (2).JPG|thumb|right|Detail of the formation of a dense aeroplankton cloud at sunset, over the [[Loire river]] in France.]]
'''Aeroplankton''' (or '''aerial plankton''') are tiny lifeforms that float and drift in the air, carried by the [[Air current|current]] of the [[wind]]; they are the [[atmospheric]] [[analogy (biology)|analogue]] to oceanic [[plankton]].

Most of the living things that make up aeroplankton are very small to [[Microscope|microscopic]] in size, and many can be difficult to identify because of their tiny size. Scientists can collect them for study in traps and sweep nets from [[aircraft]], kites or balloons.&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Hardy and P. S. Milne (1938) Studies in the Distribution of Insects by Aerial Currents. Journal of Animal Ecology, 7(2):199-229&lt;/ref&gt; 

The aeroplankton comprises numerous [[Microorganism|microbes]], including [[virus]]es, about 1000 different species of [[bacteria]], around 40,000 varieties of [[Fungus|fungi]], and hundreds of species of [[protist]]s, [[algae]], [[moss]]es and [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]] that live some part of their life cycle as aeroplankton, often as [[spore]]s, [[pollen]], and wind-scattered [[seed]]s. 

A large number of small animals, mainly [[arthropod]]s (such as [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s), are also carried upwards into the atmosphere by air currents and may be found floating  several thousand feet up. [[Aphid]]s, for example, are frequently found at high altitudes.

Many species of spiders deliberately use the wind to propel themselves. The spider will find a vantage point (such as a branch, fence or surface) and, pointing its [[abdomen]] upward, eject fine threads of [[Spider silk|silk]] from its [[spinneret (spider)|spinnerets]]. At some point, the force exerted by moving air upon the silk threads is great enough to launch the spider into the air. This is called ballooning. Such [[Ballooning (spider)|ballooning spiders]] (e.g. [[Linyphiidae]]) are capable of drifting many miles away from where they started. The flexibility of their silk draglines can aid the aerodynamics of their flight, causing the spiders to drift an unpredictable and sometimes long distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leap forward for 'flying' spiders|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5174012.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 July 2014|date=12 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Amazons''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνες}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazónes}}'', singular {{lang|grc|Ἀμαζών}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazōn}}'') were a tribe of women warriors related to [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]]. [[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AresFamily.html Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica, Book 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] place them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]],&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh4110.htm Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas, states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 52]&lt;/ref&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mytilene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in [[Prometheus Bound]], places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/AeschylusPrometheus.html AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

Notable queens of the Amazons are [[Penthesilea]], who participated in the [[Trojan War]], and her sister [[Hippolyta]], whose magical girdle, given to her by her father [[Ares]], was the object of one of the [[labours of Heracles]]. [[Diodorus]] mentions that the Amazons traveled from Libya under Queen [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Amazon warriors were often depicted in battle with Greek warriors in [[amazonomachy|amazonomachies]] in classical art.

Archaeological discoveries of burial sites with female warriors on the Eurasian steppes suggest that the [[Scythian]] women may have inspired the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Worrall|title=Amazon Warriors Did Indeed Fight and Die Like Men|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141029-amazons-scythians-hunger-games-herodotus-ice-princess-tattoo-cannabis/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foreman|first1=Amanda|title=The Amazon Women: Is There Any Truth Behind the Myth?|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/amazon-women-there-any-truth-behind-myth-180950188/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[early modern period]], their name has become a term for female warriors in general. Amazons were said to have founded the cities and temples of Smyrna, Sinope, Cyme, Gryne, Ephesus, Pitania, Magnesia, Clete, Pygela, Latoreria and Amastris; according to legend, the Amazons also invented the [[cavalry]].&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria| last2=Chesler| first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title= Wonder Woman | publisher= Hole, Rinehart and Winston and Warner Books | date=1972 | isbn = 0-03-005376-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palaephatus]], who was trying to rationalize the Greek myths in his work ''On Unbelievable Tales'' or ''On Incredible Tales'' ({{lang-grc|Περὶ ἀπίστων ἱστοριῶν}}), stated that the Amazons most probably were men mistaken for women by their enemies because they wore clothing which reached their feet, tied up their hair in headbands and shaved their beards, and also, since they did not exist during his time, most probably they did nοt exist in the past either.&lt;ref&gt;Palaephatus On Unbelievable Tales&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t4EfiGQwgh4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Unbelievable Tales, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a-NmaO-kM2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans, p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The origin of the word is uncertain. It may be derived from an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[ethnonym]] ''*ha-mazan-'' "warriors", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]'s gloss {{lang|grc|"ἁμαζακάραν· πολεμεῖν. Πέρσαι"}} ("''{{transl|grc|hamazakaran}}'': 'to make war' in Persian"), where it appears together with the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] root ''*kar-'' "make" (from which [[Sanskrit]] ''[[karma]]'' is also derived).&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, ''Xenia Lidéniana'' (1912), 270ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]], ''Greek Etymological Dictionary'' (1960–1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

It may also be derived from ''{{PIE|*ṇ-mṇ-gw-jon-es}}'' "manless, without husbands" ([[privative a|''a-'' privative]] and a derivation of ''[[Man (word)|*man-]]'' also found in Slavic ''muzh'') has been proposed, an explanation deemed "unlikely" by [[Hjalmar Frisk]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsohn, [[Kuhns Zeitschrift|KZ]] 54, 278ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]] (1960–1970).&lt;/ref&gt; 19th-century scholarship also connected the term to the ethnonym [[Amazigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Cadogan Rothery, ''The Amazons'' (1910), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/ama/ama08.htm ch. 7]: "There have been some authors who trace the word Amazon from this term."&lt;/ref&gt; A further explanation proposes Iranian *''ama-janah'' "virility-killing" as source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinge|2005|pp=94–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The Hittite researcher Friedrich Cornelius assumes that there had been the land Azzi with the capital Chajasa in the area of the Thermodon-Iris Delta on the coast of the Black Sea. He brings its residents in direct relation to the Amazons, namely based on its name (woman of the land Azzi = 'Am'+ 'Azzi' = Amazon) and its customs (matriarchal custom of promiscuous sexual intercourse, even with blood relatives).

Among Classical Greeks, ''amazon'' was given a [[False etymology|folk etymology]] as originating from ''{{transl|grc|a-}}'' ({{lang|grc|ἀ-}}) and ''{{transl|grc|mazos}}'' ({{lang|grc|μαζός}}), "without [[breast]]", connected with an [[etiology|etiological]] tradition once claimed by [[Justin (historian)|Marcus Justinus]] who alleged that Amazons had their right [[mastectomy|breast cut off]] or [[breast ironing|burnt out]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justinus']] "Historiae Phillippicae ex Trogo Pompeio", Liber II, 4: "Virgines (...) armis, equis, venationibus exercebant, inustis infantum dexterioribus mammis, ne sagittarum iactus impediantur; unde dictae Amazones." "They exercised the virgins on weapon-wielding, horse-riding and hunting, and burned the children's right breasts, so that arrow-throwing wouldn't be impeded; and for such reason, they were called Amazons."&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication of such a practice in ancient works of art,&lt;ref name=Mayor&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-amazons-lives--legends-of-warrior-women-across-the-ancient-world-by-adrienne-mayor-book-review-9799090.html|title=The Amazons: Lives &amp; Legends of Warrior Women Across the Ancient World by Adrienne Mayor, book review|last=Haynes|first=Natalie|date=16 October 2014|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Amazons are always represented with both breasts, although one is frequently covered.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amazons|volume=1|pages=790–791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt; Adrienne Mayor suggests the origin of this myth was due to the word's etymology.&lt;ref name=Mayor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adrienne Mayor, Start the Week, Radio Four|date= 6 April 2015|time= 21:30 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05plghp|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greeks also used some [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktona}}'') ("killers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("against men") and Aeschylus, in his work ''Prometheus Bound'', used ''styganor'' ({{lang|grc|στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men").&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0009%3Acard%3D696 Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Amazon Anıtı (2).jpg|thumb|upleft|Amazons monument in [[Samsun]], [[Turkey]].]]

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] placed them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]] and [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]].&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Herodotus also mentions that some Amazons lived at Scythia because after the Greeks defeated the Amazons in battle, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them, then these Amazons landed at Scythian lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D110%3Asection%3D1 Herodotus Histories]&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo writes that the original home of the Amazons was in Themiscyra and the plains about Thermodon and the mountains that lie above them, but were later driven out of these places, and during his time they were said to live in the mountains above [[Caucasian Albania]] (not to be confused with the modern [[Albania]]), but he also states that some others, among them [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], say that after Themiscyra, the Amazons traveled and lived on the borders of the Gargarians, in the northerly foothills of those parts of the [[Caucasian Mountains]] which are called Ceraunian.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/11E*.html STRABO, GEOGRAPHY, Book XI, Chapter 5] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"/&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mitylene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt; According to [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], the Amazons lived in and about the Tanais ({{lang-grc-gre|Τάναϊς}}) river (modern [[Don River (Russia)|Don river]]), formerly called the Amazonian or Amazon ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνιος}}) river, because the Amazons bathed themselves therein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0400%3Achapter%3D14 Pseudo-Plutarch-XIV, TANAIS]&lt;/ref&gt; The Amazons later moved to [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]] (speculated to be modern [[Terme]], though no ruins exist) on the River [[Thermodon]] (the Terme river in northern Turkey).
[[Plutarch]] mentions that the campaign(s) of [[Heracles]] and [[Theseus]] against the Amazons was at [[Euxine Sea]] (modern Black Sea).&lt;ref name="uchicago2"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/theseus*.html Plutarch, The Parallel Lives, The Life of Theseus]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

[[File:Amazon trousers BM VaseB673.jpg|thumb|upright|Amazon wearing trousers and carrying a shield with an attached patterned cloth and a quiver. [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic white-ground [[alabastron]], {{circa|470 BC}}, [[British Museum]], London.]]
The Amazons were supposed to have founded many towns, amongst them [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]], [[Myrina (Aeolis)|Myrina]], [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], [[Paphos]], [[Mitylene]].&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; At [[Patmos]] there was a place called Amazonium.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stadiasm. Mar. Mag. p. 488, ed. Hoffmann&lt;/ref&gt; Also, on the island of [[Lemnos]], there was another Myrina.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; The cities of Myrina had this name after the amazon [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]].

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that at Thermodon the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==

Greeks also used other [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktonα}}'') ("killers/slayers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("equivalent to men") and Aeschylus used the ''Styganor'' ({{lang|grc|Στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men")&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; in his work [[Prometheus Bound]].

[[Herodotus]] stated that in the Scythian language they were called ''Oiorpata'', ''oior'' meaning "man", and ''pata'' meaning "to slay".&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;

==Mythology==
In some versions of the myth, no men were permitted to have sexual encounters or reside in Amazon country; but once a year, in order to prevent their race from dying out, they visited the [[Gargareans]], a neighbouring tribe.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Strabo]], giving credits to [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], mentions that at his time the Amazons were believed to live on the borders of the [[Gargareans]]. There were two special months in the spring in which they would go up into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the Gargareans. The Gargareans also, in accordance with an ancient custom, would go there to offer sacrifice with the Amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children. They did this in secrecy and darkness, any Gargareans at random with any Amazon, and after making them pregnant they would send them away. Any females that were born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but the males would be taken to the Gargareans to be brought up; and each Gargarean to whom a child is brought would adopt the child as his own, regarding the child as his son because of his uncertainty.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt; He also stated that the Gargareans went up from Themiscyra into this region with the Amazons, then, in company with some Thracians and Euboeans who had wandered thus far, waged war against them. They later ended the war against the Amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children, and that each people should live independent of the other.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
In addition, he states that the right breasts of all Amazons are seared when they are infants, so that they can easily use their right arm for every needed purpose, and especially that of throwing the javelin and use the bow.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;

Herodotus mentions that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"/&gt; According to him, the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001"/&gt; Also, he mention that on an island, the Queens of the Amazons, Otrere ({{lang|grc|Ὀτρηρή}}) and Antiope ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιόπη}}), built a marble temple of Ares. On this desert island there were ravening birds, which in countless numbers haunt it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo17.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 380-390]&lt;/ref&gt; The island mentioned is the [[Aretias]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D13 Pliny the Elder, The Natural History-Book VI-Chapter 13.5]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argonauts]] passed by Themiscyra on their journey to [[Colchis]].

The King [[Iobates]] sent [[Bellerophon]] against Amazons, hoping that they would kill him, but Bellerophon killed them all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' vi. 186, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] ''On [[Lycophron]]'' 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DO.%3Apoem%3D13 Pindar, Olympian 13:89]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons appear in [[Greek art]] of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] and in connection with several Greek legends. The tomb of [[Myrine]] is mentioned in the ''Iliad''; later interpretation made of her an Amazon: according to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' Book ii.45-46; book iii.52-55&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Diodorus, the Amazons under the rule of Queen Myrina, invaded the lands of the [[Atlantis|Atlantians]]. Amazons defeated the army of the Atlantian city of Cerne, treated the captives savagely, killed all the men, led into slavery the children and women, and razed the city. When the terrible fate of the inhabitants of Cerne became known among the other Atlantians, they were struck with terror, surrendered their cities on terms of capitulation and announced that they would do whatever should be commanded them. Queen Myrina bearing herself honourably towards the Atlantians, established friendship with them and founded a city to bear her name in place of the city of Cerne which had been razed; and in it she settled both the captives and any native who so desired. Atlantians presented her with magnificent presents and by public decree voted to her notable honours, and she in return accepted their courtesy and in addition promised that she would show kindness to their nation. Diodorus also mentions that the Amazons of Queen Myrina used the skins of gigantic snakes, from Libya, to protect themselves at battle. Later Queen Myrine led her Amazons to victory against the [[Gorgons]]. After the battle against the Gorgons, Myrina accorded a funeral to her fallen comrades on three pyres and raised up three great heaps of earth as tombs, which are called "Amazon Mounds" ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνων σωρούς}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the [[Labours of Hercules|tasks imposed upon Hercules]] by [[Eurystheus]] was to obtain possession of the [[girdle]] of the Amazonian queen [[Hippolyta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' ii. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' iv. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] xi. 244&lt;/ref&gt; He was accompanied by his friend [[Theseus]], who carried off the princess [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], sister of Hippolyta, an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of [[Attica]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' i. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' 26-28&lt;/ref&gt; in which Antiope perished fighting by the side of Theseus.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In some versions, however, Theseus marries Hippolyta and in others, he marries Antiope and she does not die; by this marriage with the Amazon Theseus had a son [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]]. 
In another version of this myth, Theseus made this voyage on his own account, after the time of Heracles.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;
The battle between the Athenians and Amazons is often commemorated in an entire genre of art, [[amazonomachy]], in marble [[bas-relief]]s such as from the [[Parthenon]] or the sculptures of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]].
[[File:Johann Georg Platzer - Thalestris im Lager Alexander des Großen.jpg|left|thumb|300px|''[[Thalestris]], Queen of the Amazons, visits [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]]]

[[Plutarch]], in his work [[Parallel Lives]]-The Life of Theseus, mentions that Bion said that the Amazons, were naturally friendly to men, and did not fly from Theseus when he touched upon their coasts.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;

Amazons attacked the [[Phrygia]]ns, who were assisted by [[Priam]], then a young man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' iii. 189&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, however, towards the end of the [[Trojan War]], his old opponents took his side against the Greeks under their queen [[Penthesilea]] "of [[Thrace|Thracian]] birth", who was slain by [[Achilles]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Aethiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''Iliad''. The epic, by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], is lost: only references to it survive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] i. 699&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]] ii.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 490&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' v. 11. § 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]] ''Her.'' xix. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The god [[Dionysus]] and his entourage fought the amazons at [[Ephesus]], the Amazons fled to [[Samos]], but Dionysus pursued them and at Samos he killed a great number of them on a spot which was, from that occurrence, called Panaema ({{lang|grc|Πάναιμα}}), which means blood-soaked field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rboWBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0216%3Asection%3D56 Plutarch, Quaestiones Graecae, Question 56]&lt;/ref&gt; In another myth Dionysus united with the Amazons to fight against [[Cronus]] and the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3E*.html DIODORUS SICULUS LIBRARY OF HISTORY, Book III, 74]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|island of Leuke]], at the mouth of the [[Danube]], where the ashes of Achilles had been deposited by [[Thetis]]. The ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses, that they threw and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retire. [[Pompey]] is said to have found them in the army of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

They are heard of in the time of Alexander, when some of the king's biographers make mention of Amazon Queen [[Thalestris]] visiting him and becoming a mother by him (the story is known from the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Greek [[Alexander Romance]], [http://www.attalus.org/translate/alexander3c.html#25 3.25-26]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, several other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded [[secondary source]], [[Plutarch]]. In his writing he makes mention of a moment when Alexander's secondary naval commander, [[Onesicritus]], was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King [[Lysimachus]] of [[Thrace]] who was on the original expedition: the king smiled at him and said "And where was I, then?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/6-7.html#46 Chapter 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman writer [[Virgil]]'s characterization of the [[Volsci]]an warrior maiden [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' borrows heavily from the myth of the Amazons.

[[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]'' ({{circa|560}}), purporting to give the earliest history of the [[Goths]], relates that the Goths' ancestors, descendants of [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]], originally dwelt within Scythia, on the [[Sea of Azov]] between the [[Dnieper]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don Rivers]]. After a few centuries, following an incident where the Goths' women successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe, while the menfolk were off campaigning against Pharaoh [[Vesosis]], the women formed their own army under [[Marpesia]] and crossed the Don, invading Asia. Her sister [[Lampedo]] remained in Europe to guard the homeland. They procreated with men once a year. These Amazons conquered Armenia, Syria, and all of Asia Minor, even reaching [[Ionia]] and [[Aeolis|Aeolia]], holding this vast territory for 100 years. Jordanes also mentions that they fought with Hercules, and in the Trojan War, and that a smaller contingent of them endured in the Caucasus Mountains until the time of Alexander. He mentions by name the Queens Menalippe, Hippolyta, and Penthesilea.

In the Grottaferrata Version of ''[[Digenes Akritas]]'', the twelfth century medieval epic of Basil, the Greek-Syrian knight of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] frontier, the hero battles with and kills the female warrior Maximo.

* She was descended from some Amazons.
* Taken by Alexander from the Brahmans.&lt;ref&gt;''Digenis Akritas: the Two-Blood Border Lord'', translated by Denison B. Hull, 1972, Ohio University Press, G-vi, 385-387, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several (conflicting) lists of names of Amazons.
* [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'' I&lt;/ref&gt; lists the attendant warriors of Penthesilea: "Clonie was there, Polemusa, Derinoe, Evandre, and [[Antandre]], and [[Bremusa]], [[Hippothoe]], dark-eyed Harmothoe, [[Alcibie]], Derimacheia, Antibrote, and Thermodosa glorying with the spear."
* [[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' IV. 16&lt;/ref&gt; lists twelve Amazons who challenged Heracles to single combat during his quest for Hippolyta's girdle and died against him one by one: [[Aella (Amazon)|Aella]], Philippis, Prothoe, Eriboea, [[Celaeno]], Eurybia, [[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]], Deianeira, [[Asteria (mythology)|Asteria]], Marpe, Tecmessa, Alcippe. After Alcippe's death, a group attack followed. Diodorus also mentions [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]] as a queen of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another list of Amazons' names is found in [[Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 163&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Hippolyta]], [[Otrera]], [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]] and [[Penthesilea]], it attests the following names: Ocyale, Dioxippe, Iphinome, Xanthe, [[Hippothoe]], Laomache, [[Glauce]], [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]], Theseis, Clymene, Polydora.
* Yet another different set of names is found in [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]]' ''Argonautica'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/ValeriusFlaccus1.html Argonautica]'', 6. 370-377&lt;/ref&gt; he mentions Euryale, Harpe, Lyce, Menippe and Thoe. Of these Lyce also appears in a fragment preserved in the ''[[Latin Anthology]]'' where she is said to have killed the hero Clonus of [[Moesia]], son of Doryclus, with her javelin.&lt;ref name="Latin Anthology" /&gt;
* [[John Tzetzes]] in ''Posthomerica''&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]], ''Posthomerica'', 176-183&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the Amazons who fell at [[Troy]]: Hippothoe, Antianeira, Toxophone, Toxoanassa, Gortyessa, Iodoce, Pharetre, Andro, Ioxeia, Oïstrophe, Androdaïxa, Aspidocharme, Enchesimargos, Cnemis, Thorece, Chalcaor, Eurylophe, Hecate, Anchimache, Andromache the queen. Concerning Antianeira and Andromache, see below; for almost all the other names on the list, this is a unique attestation.
* [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] provides an alternate list of the Amazons who fell against Heracles, describing them as "the most prominent" of their people: Tralla, Isocrateia, Thiba, Palla, Coea (Koia), Coenia (Koinia).&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. ''Thibaïs''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] gives the same list minus the last two names.&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on [[Dionysius Periegetes]], 828&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stephanus and Eustathius write of these Amazons in connection with the placename Thibais, which they report to have been derived from Thiba's name.

Other names of Amazons from various sources include:

* [[Aegea]], queen of the Amazons who was thought by some to have been the [[eponym]] of the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], s. v. ''Aegeum Mare''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainia, presumably accompanied [[Penthesilea]] to the [[Trojan War]], killed by [[Achilles]]; known only from an Attic terracotta relief fragment.&lt;ref&gt;New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 42.11.33, c. 600. ''LIMC'', "Achilleus" no. 720*.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Amastris, who was believed to be the [[eponym]] of the city previously known as Kromna,&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]] in [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v.

''Kynna''. Stephanus does not write out the Amazon's name, simply stating that the town Cynna could have been named "after one of the Amazons".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ephesos, a [[Lydia]]n Amazon, after whom the city of [[Ephesus]] was thought to have been named; she was also said to have been the first to honor [[Artemis]] and to have surnamed the goddess ''Ephesia''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'' 402. 8, under ''Ephesos''&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter Amazo was thought of as the eponym of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v.

===Hero cults===
According to ancient sources ([[Plutarch]], [[Theseus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:BiDerPMT15YJ:classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/theseus.html+Amazon+statues+in+Scotussa&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4 |title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; Theseus by Plutarch |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]), Amazon tombs could be found frequently throughout what was once known as the ancient Greek world. Some are found in [[Megara]], [[Athens]], [[Chaeronea]], [[Chalcis]], [[Thessaly]] at [[Skotousa]], in [[Cynoscephalae (Thessaly)|Cynoscephalae]], and statues of Amazons are all over Greece. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], quoting [[Ephorus]], mention that the tomb of the amazon Anaea ({{lang|grc|Ἀναία}}) was at the city of [[Söke|Anaea]] ({{lang|grc|Ἄναια}}), which also has this name after the amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mary Bennett| first = Florence | title = Religious Cults Associated With the Amazons| url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm| publisher = Forgotten Books |date= December 2007 | isbn = 978-1605063867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At both Chalcis and Athens, [[Plutarch]] tells us that there was an Amazoneum or shrine of Amazons that implied the presence of both tombs and cult. At the entrance of Athens there was a monument to the Amazon [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D2 Pausanias, Description of Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; On the day before the Thesea at Athens there were annual sacrifices to the Amazons. In historical times Greek maidens of [[Ephesus]] performed an annual circular dance with weapons and shields that had been established by [[Hippolyta]] and her Amazons. They had initially set up wooden statues of [[Artemis]], a ''bretas'' ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ({{floruit|{{circa|AD 160}}}}): ''Description of Greece'', Book I: Attica).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/pausanias-bk1.html |title=Ancient History Sourcebook: Pausanias: Description of Greece, Book I: Attica |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In art===
[[File:Gladiatrix relief.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[female gladiator]]s with their names ''Amazonia and Achillea''.]]

In works of art, battles between Amazons and Greeks are placed on the same level as – and often associated with – battles of Greeks and [[centaur]]s. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called ''pelta'', and in early art a helmet. The model in the Greek mind had apparently been the goddess [[Athena]]. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly [[Iran|Persian]] – that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the ''kidaris''. They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
This depiction of Amazons demonstrates just how closely, in the Greek mind, the Amazons were linked to the Scythians. Their manner of dress has been noted to bear a striking similarity to the traditional dress of nomadic peoples from the Crimea to Mongolia.&lt;ref name="amaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous_seasons/case_amazon/clues.html |title=SECRETS OF THE DEAD . Amazon Warrior Women. Clues and Evidence |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazons were described by Herodotus as wearing trousers and having tall stiff caps.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The double-sided axe was the most emblematic of their weapons.&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"/&gt; Amazons can also be identified in vase paintings by the fact that they are wearing one earring. The battle between Theseus and the Amazons ([[Amazonomachy]]) is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the [[Temple of Apollo at Bassae]], now in the [[British Museum]]), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at [[Athens]] it was represented on the shield of the statue of [[Athena Parthenos]], on wall-paintings in the [[Theseum]] and in the ''[[Stoa Poikile]]''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; There were also three standard [[Amazon statue types]].

Later in the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]], as Amazon myth evolved, artists started to depict warrior women in a new light. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] was often thought of as an Amazon-like warrior during her reign and was sometimes depicted as such.&lt;!-- really? Examples? --&gt; Though, as explained in ''Divinia Viagro'' by Winfried Schleiner, Celeste T. Wright "has given a detailed account of the bad press Amazons had in the Renaissance (with respect to their unwomanly conduct and Scythian cruelty). She notes that she has not found any Elizabethans comparing the queen directly to an Amazon, and suggests that they might have hesitated to do so because of the association of Amazons with enfranchisement of women, which was considered contemptible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Divina Virago": Queen Elizabeth as an Amazon|jstor = 4173965|journal = Studies in Philology|date = 1978-04-01|pages = 163–180|volume = 75|issue = 2|first = Winfried|last = Schleiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan Brueghel]] depicted the Battle of the Amazons around 1598, showing many attributes of Renaissance-styled paintings. Amazons also appear in the [[Rococo]] period in another painting titled ''Battle of the Amazons'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]. As a part of the Romantic period revival, German artist [[Anselm Feuerbach]] painted the Amazons as well. His paintings “engendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = German masters of the nineteenth century : paintings and drawings from the Federal Republic of Germany / The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York :: Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications|url = http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/71300|website = libmma.contentdm.oclc.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

==In historiography==
[[File:S03 06 01 020 image 2552.jpg|thumbnail|Amazon in combat, infl. Polyclitus, Rome. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
[[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men". Moreover, said Herodotus, "No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle". In the story related by Herodotus, a group of Amazons was blown across the [[Sea of Azov|Maeotian Lake]] (the [[Sea of Azov]]) into [[Scythia]] near the cliff region (today's southeastern [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]). After learning the Scythian language, they agreed to marry Scythian men, on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of Scythian women. According to Herodotus, this band moved toward the northeast, settling beyond the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] ([[Don River (Russia)|Don]]) river, and became the ancestors of the [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]]. According to Herodotus, the [[Sarmatians]] fought with the Scythians against [[Darius the Great]] in the 5th century BC.

Hippocrates describes them as: "They have no right breasts...for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&amp;query=Hipp.%20Aer.%2017&amp;getid=2|title=Perseus Under Philologic: Hipp. Aer. 17|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. Caesar reminded the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders ([[Strabo]] 5.504; Nicholas Damascenus). [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. [[Pliny the Elder]] records some surprising facts pointing to the valley of the [[Terme River]] as possibly being their home: a mountain named for them (the modern Mason Dagi), as well as a settlement Amazonium; Herodotus (VI.86) first mentions their capital [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]], which Pliny locates near the Terme.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]] VI.3.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philostratus]] places the Amazons in the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] places them east of [[Tanais]], as neighbouring the [[Alans]]. [[Procopius]] places them in the Caucasus. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' III, chapter 52) mentioned that besides [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] Amazons existed much older race (at that time entirely disappeared) of Amazons from western [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], and retells their mythological story which includes [[Atlantis]] and Greek mythology.

Although Strabo shows skepticism as to their historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]] embraces the account of Pliny. Under [[Aurelianus]], captured [[Goths|Gothic]] women were identified as Amazons ([[Claudian]]us). The account of [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] was influential, and was used as a source by [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. A. Ukert]], ''Die Amazonen'', Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1849), 63..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance literature==
[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dahomey Amazons]] were so named by Western observers due to their similarity to the mythical Amazons]]

Amazons continued to be discussed by authors of the European Renaissance, and with the [[Age of Exploration]], they were located in ever more remote areas. In 1542, [[Francisco de Orellana]] reached the [[Amazon River]] (''Amazonas'' in Spanish), naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have encountered and fought on the [[Nhamundá River]], a tributary of the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;It has been suggested that what Orellana actually engaged was an especially warlike tribe of Native Americans whose warrior men had long hair and thus appeared to him as women. See Theobaldo Miranda Santos, ''Lendas e mitos do Brasil'' ("Brazil's legends and myths"), Companhia Editora Nacional, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon (''Amazônia'' in Portuguese, ''Amazonía'' in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Walter Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Ukert (1849), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Famous medieval traveller [[John Mandeville]] mentions them in his book:

{{quote|Beside the land of Chaldea is the land of Amazonia, that is the land of Feminye. And in that realm is all woman and no man; not as some may say, that men may not live there, but for because that the women will not suffer no men amongst them to be their sovereigns.&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', Dover publications, Mineola, New York, 2006, cap. XVII, p. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Medieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the [[Corded Ware culture|battle-axe]]. This is probably related to the ''[[sagaris]]'', an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also [[Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan]]). [[Paulus Hector Mair]] expresses astonishment that such a "manly weapon" should have been invented by a "tribe of women", but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, [[Johannes Aventinus]].

[[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power. The Amazons and Queen Hippolyta are also referenced in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' in "[[The Knight's Tale]]".

==Historical background==
[[Classics|Classicist]] Peter Walcot wrote, "Wherever the Amazons are located by the Greeks, whether it is somewhere along the Black Sea in the distant north-east, or in Libya in the furthest south, it is always beyond the confines of [[Civilization|the civilized world]]. The Amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience."&lt;ref&gt;P. Walcot, "Greek Attitudes towards Women: The Mythological Evidence" ''Greece &amp; Rome''2nd Series 31.1 (April 1984, pp. 37-47) p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the Amazons of Greek historiography, the most obvious candidates being historical [[Scythia]] and [[Sarmatia]] in line with the account by [[Herodotus]], but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of Asia Minor or even [[Minoan Crete]].

==Archaeology==
===Scythians and Sarmatians===
Speculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials, pointing to the possibility that some Sarmatian women may have participated in battle. These findings have led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend in [[Greek mythology]] may have been "inspired by real warrior women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Lyn Webster Wilde, "Did the Amazons really exist?" '&amp;#39;Diotima'&amp;#39; |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of high-ranking warrior women comes from [[kurgan]]s in southern Ukraine and Russia.
David Anthony notes, "About 20% of [[Scythians|Scythian]]-[[Sarmatian]] 'warrior graves' on the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and lower [[Volga river|Volga]] contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress, a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons."&lt;ref name="anthonyd"&gt;{{cite book| last = Anthony| first = David W.| title = The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World| url = https://books.google.com/?id=mTxQmQEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 0-691-05887-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amazone Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2342.jpg|thumb|Mounted Amazon in [[Scythia]]n costume, on an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure vase, {{circa}}420 BC]]
Up to 25% of military burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Diotima |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya points out that when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-[[hegemony]] in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Before modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under [[kurgan]]s in the region of [[Altai Mountains]] and Sarmatia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/9701/abstracts/sarmatians.html "Warrior Women of Eurasia"], Archaeology Magazine (Abstract) Volume 50 Number 1, January/February 1997 Retrieved 7/10/08.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;In a recent excavation of [[Sarmatian]] sites by Dr. Jeannine Davis-Kimball,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} a tomb was found wherein female warriors were buried.&lt;/ref&gt; giving concrete form at last to the Greek tales, the origin of the Amazon story had been the subject of speculation among classics scholars. In the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] speculation ranged along the following lines:

{{quote|While some regard the Amazons as a purely mythical people, others assume an historical foundation for them. The deities worshipped by them were [[Ares]] (who is consistently assigned to them as a god of war, and as a god of [[Thrace|Thracian]] and generally northern origin) and [[Artemis]], not the usual Greek goddess of that name, but an Asiatic deity in some respects her equivalent. It is conjectured that the Amazons were originally the temple-servants and priestesses (''hierodulae'') of this goddess; and that the removal of the breast corresponded with the self-mutilation of the god [[Attis]] and the [[galli]], Roman priests of [[Cybele|Rhea Cybele]]. Another theory is that, as the knowledge of geography extended, travellers brought back reports of tribes ruled entirely by women, who carried out the duties which elsewhere were regarded as peculiar to man, in whom alone the rights of nobility and inheritance were vested, and who had the supreme control of affairs. Hence arose the belief in the Amazons as a nation of female warriors, organized and governed entirely by women. According to J. Viirtheim (''De Ajacis'' origine, 1907), the Amazons were of Greek origin [...] It has been suggested that the fact of the conquest of the Amazons being assigned to the two famous heroes of Greek mythology, Heracles and Theseus [...] shows that they were mythical illustrations of the dangers which beset the Greeks on the coasts of Asia Minor; rather perhaps, it may be intended to represent the conflict between the Greek culture of the colonies on the [[Black Sea|Euxine]] and the barbarism of the native inhabitants.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;}}

===Minoan Crete===
[[File:Departure of the Amazons MET DP318355.jpg|thumb|''Departure of the Amazons'', by [[Claude Deruet]], 1620]]

When [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] archeology was still in its infancy, nevertheless, a theory raised in an essay regarding the Amazons contributed by [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] and [[John Myres]] to [[Robert Ranulph Marett]]'s ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1908),&lt;ref&gt;L.R. Farnell and J.L. Myres, "Herodotus and anthropology" in [[Robert Ranulph Marett|Robert R. Marett]] ''Anthropology and the Classics'' 1908, pp. 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt; placed their possible origins in Minoan civilization, drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures. According to Myres,&lt;ref&gt;(pp.&amp;nbsp;153 ff)&lt;/ref&gt; the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in Minoan culture. &lt;!--The following is a "hard sell" for an outdated idea: "The theory that the Amazons originally represented Minoan Crete's women has a strong case based on what [[archeologists]] and historians have been discovering about Minoan culture. Out of all the ancient civilizations which are so far known to archaeologists and historians the Minoans seem to fit most of the aspects that classical Greeks and later scholars have come to associate with the Amazonian culture."--&gt;

==Modern legacy==

[[File:Juliusz Kossak - Amazonka.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juliusz Kossak]] "An Amazon"]]
[[Francisco de Orellana]] gave the [[Amazon river]] its name after reporting pitched battles with tribes of female warriors, whom he likened to the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Samsun]] in modern-day [[Turkey]] features a recently constructed "Amazon Village" museum, created to bring attention to the legacy of the Amazons and to generate both academic interest and popular tourism.&lt;ref name="todayszaman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |title=Village of Amazons to be recreated in Samsun park - Today's Zaman, your gateway to Turkish daily news |publisher=Todayszaman.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214800/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival is also held every year in the [[Terme]] district of [[Samsun Province]] to celebrate the Amazons.&lt;ref name="todayszaman" /&gt;

In Greece, female [[equestrians]] are also called "Amazons" ({{lang-el|Αμαζόνες}}).

Amazons became an important subject of the fine arts around 1900, especially in the work of the Munich painter and sculptor [[Franz Stuck]] (1863-1928). 

In Nazi-Germany open air events called "Nacht der Amazonen" ([[Night of the Amazons]]) were performed at [[Nymphenburg Palace]] in [[Munich]] between 1936 and 1939. These revues with bare-breasted girls presented an allegedly emancipated female role as part of the „new race“ intended to be realized by racial fanatics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18953">'''Animal welfare science''' is the scientific study of the welfare of animals as pets, in zoos, laboratories, on farms and in the wild.  Although [[animal welfare]] has been of great concern for many thousands of years in religion and culture, the investigation of animal welfare using rigorous [[scientific method]]s is a relatively recent development. The world's first Professor of Animal Welfare Science, [[Donald Broom]], was appointed by [[Cambridge University]] (UK) in 1986.

==Historical legislation and guidelines==
Early legislation which formed the impetus for assessing animal welfare and the subsequent development of animal welfare science include the [[Ireland]] Parliament (Thomas Wentworth) ''"[[An Act against Plowing by the Tayle, and pulling the Wooll off living Sheep]]"'', 1635, and the Massachusetts Colony ([[Nathaniel Ward]]) ''"Off the Bruite Creatures"'' Liberty 92 and 93 in the ''"[[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]]"'' of 1641.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animalrightshistory.org/animal-rights-law/renaissance-legislation/1635-ireland-act-horses-sheep.htm |title=Animal Rights History |accessdate=8 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001083518/http://www.animalrightshistory.org/animal-rights-law/renaissance-legislation/1635-ireland-act-horses-sheep.htm |archivedate=1 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Martin (Irish politician)|Richard Martin]]'s act, the ''"[[Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822]]"'' is often considered to be the precursor of modern relevant legislation.  One of the first national laws to protect animals was the UK ''"[[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835]]"'' followed by the ''"[[Protection of Animals Act 1911]]"''. In the US it was many years until there was a National law to protect animals—the ''"[[Animal Welfare Act of 1966]]"''—although there were a number of states that passed anti-cruelty laws between 1828 and 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/AWA2007/intro.shtml |title=AWIC |accessdate=8 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302102008/http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/AWA2007/intro.shtml |archivedate=2 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In India, animals are protected by the ''"[[The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act,1960|Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960]]"''.  In the UK, the ''"[[Animal Welfare Act 2006]]"'' consolidated many different forms of animal welfare legislation.

Animal welfare science can be considered as the assessment of welfare. The first publication to include the term "assessment" appears to be a 1965 appendix by [[William Homan Thorpe]] entitled ''The assessment of pain and distress in animals''.&lt;ref name="Thorpe, (1965)"&gt;Thorpe, W.H., (1965).  The assessment of pain and distress in animals. Appendix III in the report of the technical committee to enquire into the welfare of animals kept under intensive husbandry conditions, F.W.R. Brambell (chairman). H.M.S.O., London&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed 20 years later by a highly influential paper on assessing pain and distress in laboratory animals by Morton and Griffiths.&lt;ref name="Morton and Griffiths, (1985)"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Morton D.B. |author2=Griffiths P.H.M. | year = 1985 | title = Guidelines on the recognition of pain, distress and discomfort in experimental animals and an hypothesis for assessment | url = | journal = Veterinary Record | volume = 116 | issue = | pages = 431–436 | doi=10.1136/vr.116.16.431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of assessment==

Animal welfare science uses a variety of [[Ethology|behavioural]] or [[Physiology|physiological]] measures or indicators. Integrated approaches to assess animal welfare include risk analysis and semantic modelling{{clarify|date=April 2014}} of animal welfare.&lt;ref name = "Bracke et al., 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bracke M.B.M. |author2=Edwards S.A. |author3=Metz J.H.M. |author4=Noordhuizen J.P.T.M. |author5=Algers B. | year = 2008 | title = Synthesis of semantic modelling and risk analysis methodology applied to animal welfare | url = | journal = Animal | volume = 2 | issue = 7| pages = 1061–1072 | doi = 10.1017/S1751731108002139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisations==
Organisations interested in animal welfare science were set up before the subject became recognised as a science.  The [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (RSPCA) was founded in 1824 by a group of twenty-two reformers led by [[Richard Martin ("Humanity Dick")|Richard Martin]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] (who would thereby earn the nickname ''Humanity Dick''), [[William Wilberforce]] MP and the [[Reverend]] [[Arthur Broome]]. The [[Universities Federation for Animal Welfare]] (UFAW) history can be traced to the founding in 1926 of the University of London Animal Welfare Society (ULAWS) by Major Charles Hume. The name was changed to the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare in 1938, reflecting the increasingly wide range of people and institutions involved.

More recent organisations involved in animal welfare science include the Scientists Center for Animal Welfare (SCAW) and university departments specialising in this branch of science including the Animal Welfare and Anthrozoology Center at [[Cambridge University]], the Animal Welfare Science Centre at [[The University of Melbourne]] in [[Australia]] and the Animal Welfare Science and Bioethics Centre at [[Massey University]] in [[New Zealand]].

Although not limited to animal welfare science, many members of the [[International Society for Applied Ethology]] work and publish research in this subject.

==Journals, articles and books==
Veterinary journals carrying articles on animal welfare have been published for many years, for example, the ''Veterinary Record'' has been published weekly since 1888.  Peer-reviewed scientific journals have been launched more recently, e.g. ''Applied Animal Behaviour Science'' in 1974, ''Animal Welfare'' in 1992, the ''Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science'' in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalsandsociety.org/jaaws/|title=JAAWS|accessdate=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Frontiers in Veterinary Science—Animal Behavior and Welfare'' in 2014.

Many books on animal welfare science have been written, for example those by Professor [[Marian Stamp Dawkins]],&lt;ref name="Dawkins, (1980)"&gt;Dawkins, M.S., (1980). ''Animal Suffering: The Science of Animal Welfare''. Chapman and Hall, London&lt;/ref&gt; Professor David Fraser,&lt;ref name="Fraser, (2008)"&gt;Fraser, D., (2008) ''Understanding Animal Welfare: The Science In Its Cultural Context''.

(2009)"&gt;Mellor, D., Patterson-Kane, E. and Stafford, K.J., (2009).  ''The Sciences of Animal Welfare''.  UFAW/Wiley-Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
In 2011 in an article on the history of animal welfare science, [[Donald Broom]] wrote "The numbers of animal welfare scientists is increasing rapidly. The subject is now being taught in all European countries and the number of university courses on animal welfare in Brazil has increased from one to over 60 in 15 years. The diversity of animal welfare science is increasing and the expansion is likely to continue. The decision by the American Veterinary Medical Association to promote the teaching of the subject in all American veterinary schools will have a substantial effect."&lt;ref name="Broom, (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Broom D.M. | year = 2011 | title = A History of Animal Welfare Science | url = | journal = Acta Biotheoretica | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 121–137 | doi = 10.1007/s10441-011-9123-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1892, '''The Bibliographical Society''' is the senior [[learned society]] dealing with the study of the [[book]] and its [[History of books|history]] in the United Kingdom.

The Society holds a monthly lecture between October and May, usually on the third Tuesday of the month at [[University College London]].

The first fifty years of the Bibliographical Society were documented in the book ''The Bibliographical Society, 1892–1942: Studies in Retrospect''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bibliographical Society, 1892–1942: Studies in Retrospect'' (London, 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Book Encompassed'', a volume of essays marking the Society's centenary was published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davison, ed., ''The Book Encompassed: Studies in Twentieth-century Bibliography'' (Cambridge, 1992) {{ISBN|978-0-521-41878-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The objectives of the Society are:

* to promote and encourage study and research in the fields of:
**   historical, analytical, descriptive and textual [[bibliography]]
**   the [[history of printing]], [[publishing]], [[bookselling]], [[bookbinding]] and [[Book collecting|collecting]]
* to hold [[meetings]] at which papers are read and discussed
* to print and publish a [[Academic journal|journal]] (''The Library'') and books concerned with bibliography
* to maintain a bibliographical [[library]]
* from time to time to award a [[medal]] for services to bibliography
* to support bibliographical research by awarding [[Grant (money)|grants and bursaries]]

==Library and archives==
The Society's library was housed at [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Hall]] in the [[City of London]] but moved to [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] in January 2007 where it is now available alongside the resources of the [[Senate House Libraries]].

The Society's [[archive]] is housed at the [[Bodleian Library]] and may be used by scholars and members of the Society.

==Publications==
The Society has published a journal since 1893, originally entitled ''Transactions of the Bibliographical Society''. In 1920 it took over publication of ''The Library'' (issued since 1889) and adopted that as the main title of the ''Transactions''. (''The Library'' was founded in 1889 by [[John Young Walker MacAlister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=MacAlister, John Y. W.|journal=Who's Who|year=1916|pages= 1389|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3453981;view=1up;seq=1429}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The different series of the ''Transactions'' and ''The Library'' are:

*''Transactions of the Bibliographical Society'', vol. 1–15 (1893–1919)
*''The Library'', vol. 1–10 (1889–1898)
*''The Library'', Second/New series, vol. 1–10 (1900–1910)
*''The Library'', Third series, vol. 1–10 (1910–1919)
*''The Library'', Fourth series, vol. 1–26 (1920–1946)
*''The Library'', Fifth series, vol. 1–33 (1946–1978)
*''The Library'', Sixth series, vol. 1–21 (1979–1999)
*''The Library'', Seventh series, vol. 1– (2000– )

''The Library'' ({{ISSN|0024-2160}}; {{ISSN search link|1744-8581}}) is a quarterly journal and is issued free to members who also receive a copy of all books published by the Society.

==Gold medal==
The Society occasionally awards a [[gold]] medal for distinguished services to bibliography to individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the development of the subject and the furtherance of the Society's aims.

'''Biological determinism of human gender roles''' is the view that human sexuality is [[genetic determinism|controlled by an individual's genes]] or some component of their [[physiology]]. This is an aspect of [[biological determinism]], the wider view that human behaviour is determined by biological factors. Both views regard the contribution of learning and other environmental factors in a person's development as being over-stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Taylor A. | editor-first1 = Verta | editor-last2 = Rupp | editor-first2 = Leila J. | editor-last3 = Whittier | editor-first3 = Nancy | title = Feminist frontiers | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=o6WMkQEACAAJ | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 2012 | edition = 9th | isbn = 9780078026621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Naiman | first = Joanne | title = How societies work: class, power, and change | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=diypPAAACAAJ | publisher = Fernwood Publishing | location = Halifax, Winnipeg | year = 2012 | edition = 5th | isbn = 9781552664810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Of human gender roles==

===Gender assignment===
Lynda Birke's ''In Pursuit of Difference'' argues that the discipline of human biology often presents "clear-cut differences"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Birke | first = Lynda | chapter = In pursuit of difference: scientific studies of women and men | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KgcpAAAAYAAJ | title = Feminism and the biological body | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780813528236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; between sexes with regards to chromosomes, genetics, and inheritance. However, while obvious physical differences between males and females exist and develop during puberty, hormonal differences are "not absolute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Laurie|first=Timothy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-03/laurie-bigotry-or-biology/6514156|title=Bigotry or biology: the hard choice for an opponent of marriage equality | work = [[The Drum (TV program)|The Drum]]|publisher=[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]] | location = Australia|date=3 June 2015|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a broad range of reproductive anatomy that doesn't necessarily fit the "gender definition" of male or female. According to the [[Intersex Society of North America]], "a person may be born with mosaic genetics", differing in their chromosomal configuration.&lt;ref name="isna.org"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Home page | url = http://www.isna.org | website = isna.org | publisher = [[Intersex Society of North America]] |access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homosexuality===
{{main|Biology and sexual orientation|Neuroscience and sexual orientation}}

Though scientists are unsure as to whether [[homosexuality]] can be attributed to biological or social factors, [[LGBT]] rights activists have used the theories of biological determinism to support their cause. This has become a frequent point of dissension between [[pro-gay]] individuals and [[anti-gay]] individuals. Due to the fact that a single cause has not been determined as the cause of homosexuality, many scholars theorize that a combination of biological and social causes determine one's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Abramson | first1 = Paul R. | last2 = Pinkerton | first2 = Steven D. | author-link1 = Paul R. Abramson | chapter = Introduction: Nature, nurture, and in-between | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5SUFxfft7zMC&amp;pg=PA4 | title = Sexual nature, sexual culture | page = 4 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780226001821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gay rights advocates]] believe that proving that homosexuality has a definite biological basis will prove it to be an unchangeable characteristic, thus allowing homosexuals to be protected under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brookey | first = Robert Alan | title = Bio-rhetoric, background beliefs and the biology of homosexuality | journal = [[Argumentation and Advocacy]] | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 171&amp;ndash;183 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/00028533.2001.11951668 | date = 2001 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/00028533.2001.11951668 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; One area of research that has been a valuable tool for gay rights activists has been [[Dean Hamer]]'s work studying the "[[Biology and sexual orientation#Chromosome linkage studies|gay gene]]". Another researcher who worked with Hamer in finding evidence for biological influence in male homosexuality was [[Simon LeVay]], a neuroscientist. In 1991, LeVay published an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' that detailed the difference in [[hypothalamic structure]]s between homosexual and heterosexual men. His findings in studying the [[INAH 3|INAH-3]] implied that "sexual orientation has a biological substrate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Spanier | first = Bonnie | title = Biological determinism and homosexuality | journal = [[NWSA Journal]], special issue: Sexual Orientation | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;71 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | date = Spring 1995 | jstor = 4316378 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though his research showed that there was a biological basis in sexual orientation, LeVay cautioned against people interpreting his article to say that he found that homosexuality is genetic, emphasizing that he did not "locate a gay center in the brain—[as] INAH3 is less likely to be the sole gay nucleus of the brain than part of a chain of nuclei engaged in men and women's sexual behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nimmons|first=David|title=Sex and the brain|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1994/mar/sexandthebrain346/?searchterm=levay#.UpLnSGRDuqw|work=[[Discover Magazine]]|date=March 1994 | access-date =9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He merely hoped that his work would serve as a catalyst in working towards finding more evidence that homosexuality is at least partly genetic.

===Social construction===
{{main|Social construction of gender}}
{{POV check|section|date=April 2017|talk=Social construction}}

[[Richard Lewontin]], [[Steven Rose]], and [[Leon Kamin]] were interested in the way that biological determinism was present in science. They wanted to figure out how much of it was true, and how much of it was socially constructed according to certain beliefs and societal norms and determined gender roles within society. In their book ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'' they explore the possibilities of biological determinism. In their studies, they found some very interesting evidence that points to the fact that biological determinism in science is actually greatly affected by certain norms and tendencies within society. According to them, biological determinism is more constructed by society than by anything else. In a study that was performed on girls who were relatively "[[masculinity|masculinized]]", biological determinists [[John Money]] and [[Anke Ehrhardt]] looked for ways to describe femininity that fit into the common definition of it, such as clothing preference or using makeup. Although these scientists believed that they were providing evidence to support their definitions of femininity within nature, they fell into the trap of labeling these girls according to Western social standards. As Lewontin points out, this experiment not only embraces the stereotypes that already existed, but it also "ignores the existence of societies in which women wear pants, or in which men wear skirts, or in which men enjoy and appropriate jewelry to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = The determined patriarchy | chapterurl = https://athens.indymedia.org/media/upload/2016/09/06/Steven_Rose_Richard_Lewontin_Leon_J._Kamin-Not_In_Our_Genes__Biology_Ideology_and_Human_Nature__-Penguin_Books_Ltd_1990.pdf | last1 = Lewontin | first1 = Richard C. | last2 = Rose | first2 = Steven | last3 = Kamin | first3 = Leon J. | author-link1 = Richard Lewontin | title = Not in our genes: biology, ideology, and human nature | pages = 132&amp;ndash;163 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York | year = 1984 | isbn = 9780140226058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin realize that biological determinism is clouded and, can in fact, be shaped according to the standards and norms of the society one lives in. Therefore, they choose to take a different approach. They decide to look at numbers and statistics instead of simple social experiments which can be easily misinterpreted. When they look at the numbers and statistics of men and women over the years, they discover that the differences between men and women are no longer as pronounced as they had been in the past. All of a sudden, there are more women in the work place holding higher ranking jobs. More women are excelling in areas that used to be male dominant, such as sports. And, even biologically, women are beginning to catch up to men in height while men are beginning to catch up in life expectancy. However, these changes are mostly visible in numbers and statistics, and social differences between men and women are still easily observed. Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin argue, however, that these differences are imposed by society itself.

The [[Anne Fausto-Sterling#The Standard Model|standard model]] for the difference between sex/gender states that there is a clear-cut dichotomy between males &amp; females, with no overlap. [[Margaret W. Rossiter]]’s article “Women’s Work in Science” discusses how in the 1880s women were introduced to the science field and hired, but although employed they were still segregated from men in the science field.&lt;ref name="Rossiter"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rossiter | first = Margaret W. | title = "Women's Work" in Science, 1880-1910 | journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 381&amp;ndash;398 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | doi = 10.2307/230118 | jstor = 230118 | date = September 1980 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/230118 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rossiter, segregation started because it was apparent that men and women worked differently and had different "talents" to offer in the field of science.&lt;ref name="Rossiter" /&gt; To add to this, women in the 1880s got paid less than the male worker in the science field. Women got paid an average of "two hundred dollars less" than their male coworkers yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jardins | first = Julie | chapter = To embrace or decline marriage and family: Annie Jump Cannon and the women of the Harvard Observatory, 1880-1940 | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HULGDNDSenYC&amp;pg=PA92 | title = The Madame Curie complex: the hidden history of women in science | page = 92 | publisher = Feminist Press at the City University of New York | location = New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781558616134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this norm there is a historically constructed viewpoint of "average", meaning that society holds the idea that one must be either male or female, feminine or masculine. [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]]'s article "''[[Sexing the Body|Of Gender and Genitals]]''" discusses how this standard model shapes doctors' ideas about gender and what is socially acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fausto-Sterling | first = Anne | author-link = Anne Fausto-Sterling | chapter = Of gender and genitals: the use and abuse of the modern intersexual | chapterurl = https://libcom.org/files/Fausto-Sterling%20-%20Sexing%20the%20Body.pdf | title = Sexing the body | pages = 44&amp;ndash;77 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | isbn = 9780465077144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that (according to the standard model) "Bodies in the "normal" range are culturally intelligible as males or females, but the rules for living as male or female are strict", meaning that people are culturally "trained" in believing that there is a sexual binary and anything outside of those confines is rejected.

'''Business analysis''' is a research [[List of academic disciplines|discipline]]&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen B Hass, Richard Vander Horst, Kimi Ziemski (2008). ''From Analyst to Leader: Elevating the Role of the Business Analyst'' Management Concepts, 2008. {{ISBN|1-56726-213-9}}. p94: "As the discipline of business analysis becomes professionalized"&lt;/ref&gt; of identifying [[business needs]] and determining solutions to business problems. Solutions often include a software-systems development component, but may also consist of process improvement, organizational change or strategic planning and policy development. The person who carries out this task is called a [[business analyst]] or BA.&lt;ref&gt;

Business analysts do not work solely on developing software systems. Those who attempt to do so run the risk of developing an incomplete solution.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.bcs.org/upload/pdf/business-analysis2.pdf Alternaltive definition of Business Analysis] from [[British Computer Society|BCS]] [[ISEB]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are different role definitions, depending upon the organization, there does seem to be an area of common ground where most
[[business analyst]]s work. The responsibilities appear to be:

* To investigate business systems, taking a holistic view of the situation. This may include examining elements of the organisation structures and staff development issues as well as current processes and IT systems.
* To evaluate actions to improve the operation of a business system. Again, this may require an examination of organisational structure and staff development needs, to ensure that they are in line with any proposed process redesign and IT system development.
* To document the business requirements for the IT system support using appropriate documentation standards.

In line with this, the core business analyst role could be defined as an internal consultancy role that has the responsibility for investigating business situations, identifying and evaluating options for improving business systems, defining requirements and ensuring the effective use of information systems in meeting the needs of the business.

==Sub-disciplines==
Business analysis as a discipline includes [[requirements analysis]], sometimes also called requirements engineering. It focuses on ensuring the changes made to an organisation are aligned with its strategic goals. These changes include changes to strategies, structures, policies, business rules, processes, and information systems.

Examples of business analysis include:

===Enterprise analysis or company analysis===
Focuses on understanding the needs of the business as a whole, its strategic direction, and identifying initiatives that will allow a business to meet those strategic goals. It also includes:

* Creating and maintaining the [[business architecture]]
* Conducting [[Feasibility study|feasibility studies]]
* Identifying new [[Business opportunity|business opportunities]]
* Scoping and defining new business opportunities
* Preparing the [[business case]]
* Conducting the initial [[risk assessment]]

===Requirements planning and management===
Involves planning the requirements development process, determining which requirements are the highest priority for implementation, and managing change.

===Requirements elicitation===
Describes techniques for collecting requirements from [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s in a project. Techniques for requirements elicitation include:

* [[Brainstorming]]
* [[Content analysis|Document analysis]]
* [[Focus group]]
* [[User interface|Interface]] analysis
* [[Interviews/Questionnaire]] 
* [[Workshops]]
* [[Reverse engineering]]
* [[Statistical survey|Surveys]]
* User [[task analysis]]
* [[Business process mapping|Process mapping]]
* Observation/[[job shadowing]]
* [[Design thinking]]

===Requirements analysis and documentation===
Describes how to develop and specify requirements in enough detail to allow them to be successfully implemented by a project team.

====Analysis====
The major forms of analysis are:

* [[Architecture analysis and design language|Architecture analysis]]
* [[Business process]] analysis
* [[Object-oriented analysis and design|Object-oriented analysis]]
* [[Structured analysis]]
* [[Data warehouse]] analysis, storage and databases analysis

====Documentation====
Requirements documentation can take several forms:

* Textual – for example, stories that summarize specific information
* [[Traceability matrix|Matrix]] – for example, a table of requirements with priorities
* [[Use case diagram|Diagrams]] – for example, how data flows from one structure to the other
* [[Website wireframe|Wireframe]] – for example, how elements are required in a website,
* Models – for example, [[Wire-frame model|3-D models]] that describes a character in a computer game

===Requirements communication===
Describes techniques for ensuring that stakeholders have a shared understanding of the requirements and how they will be implemented.

===Solution assessment and validation===
Describes how the business analyst can perform correctness of a proposed solution, how to support the implementation of a solution, and how to assess possible shortcomings in the implementation.

==Techniques==
There are a number of generic business techniques that a business analyst will use when facilitating business change.

Some of these techniques include:

===PESTLE===
{{main|PESTLE}}
This is used to  perform an external [[environmental analysis]] by examining the many different external factors affecting an organization.

The six attributes of [[PESTLE]]:
:Political (current and potential influences from political pressures)
:[[Economic]] (the local, national and world economy impact)
:[[Sociological]] (the ways in which a society can affect an organization)
:[[Technological]] (the effect of new and emerging technology)
:Legal (the effect of national and world legislation)
:Environmental (the local, national and world environmental issues)

===Heptalysis===
This is used to perform an in-depth analysis of early stage businesses/ventures on seven important categories:&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Market opportunity]]
:[[Product breakdown structure|Product]]/solution
:[[Execution plan]]
:Financial engine
:[[Human capital]]
:Potential return
:Margin of safety

===STEER===
It is an analysis that puts into consideration – the following
: Socio-cultural
: Technological
: Economic
: Ecological
: Regulatory Factors

===MOST===
This is used to perform an internal environmental analysis by defining the attributes of MOST to ensure that the project you are working on is aligned to each of the four attributes.

The four attributes of MOST are:&lt;ref&gt;

:
:[[Mission statement|Mission]] (where the business intends to go)
:[[Goal|Objectives]] (the key goals which will help achieve the mission)
:[[Strategies]] (options for moving forward)
:[[Tactic (method)|Tactic]]s (how strategies are put into action)

===SWOT===
SWOT is used to help focus activities into areas of strength and where the greatest opportunities lie. This is used to identify the dangers that take the form of weaknesses and both internal and external threats.

The four attributes of [[SWOT analysis]] are:
:[[Values in Action Inventory of Strengths|Strengths]] – What are the advantages? What is currently done well? (e.g. key area of best-performing activities of your [[company]])
:Weaknesses – What should be improved? What is there to overcome? (e.g. key area where you are performing unsatisfactorily)
:Opportunities – What good opportunities face the [[organization]]? (e.g. key area where your competitors are performing poorly)
:[[Threats]] – What obstacles does the organization face? (e.g. key area where your competitor will perform well)

===CATWOE===
This is used to prompt thinking about what the business is trying to achieve. Business perspectives help the business analyst to consider the impact of any proposed solution on the people involved.

There are six elements of CATWOE:&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Customers – Who are the beneficiaries of the highest level business process and how does the issue affect them?
:Actors – Who is involved in the situation, who will be involved in implementing solutions and what will impact their success?
:Transformation Process – What processes or systems are affected by the issue?
:World View – What is the big picture and what are the wider impacts of the issue?
:Owner – Who owns the process or situation being investigated and what role will they play in the solution?
:Environmental Constraints – What are the constraints and limitations that will impact the solution and its success?

===de Bono's Six Thinking Hats===
This is often used in a [[brainstorming]] session to generate and analyse [[ideas]] and options. It is useful to encourage specific types of thinking and can be a convenient and symbolic way to request someone to "switch gears". It involves restricting the group to only thinking in specific ways – giving ideas &amp; analysis in the "mood" of the time. Also known as the [[Six Thinking Hats]].
:White: Pure facts, logical.
:Green: Creative.
:Yellow: Bright, optimistic, positive. 
:Black: Negative, devil’s advocate. 
:Red: Emotional. 
:Blue: Cold, control.
Not all colors / moods have to be used.

===Five Whys===
[[5 Whys|Five Whys]] is used to get to the root of what is really happening in a single instance. For each answer given a further 'why' is asked.

===MoSCoW===
This is used to prioritize requirements by allocating an appropriate priority, gauging it against the validity of the requirement itself and its priority against other requirements.

[[MoSCoW]] comprises:
:Must have – or else delivery will be a failure
:Should have – otherwise will have to adopt a workaround
:Could have – to increase delivery satisfaction
:Won't have this time – useful to the exclude requirements from this delivery timeframe

===VPEC-T===
{{main|VPEC-T}}

This technique is used when analyzing the expectations of multiple parties having different views of a system in which they all have an interest in common, but have different priorities and different responsibilities.
:Values – constitute the objectives, beliefs and concerns of all parties participating. They may be financial, social, tangible and intangible
:Policies – constraints that govern what may be done and the manner in which it may be done
:Events – real-world proceedings that stimulate activity
:Content – the meaningful portion of the documents, conversations, messages, etc. that are produced and used by all aspects of business activity
:Trust – between users of the system and their right to access and change information within it

===SCRS===

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the analysis should flow from the high-level business strategy to the solution, through the current state and the requirements. SCRS stands for:

:Strategy
:Current State
:Requirements
:Solution

===Business Analysis Canvas===
The Business Analysis Canvas is a tool that enables Business Analyst to quickly present a high level view of the activities that will be completed as part of the business analysis work allocation. The Business Analysis Canvas is broken into several sections. 
: Project Objective
: Stakeholder
: Deliverable
: Impact to Target Operating Model
: Communication Approach
: Responsibilities
: Scheduling
: Key Dates

The Canvas has activities and questions the Business analyst can ask the organization to help build out the content. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.batimes.com/articles/business-analysis-canvas-roadmap-to-effective-ba-excellence.html#&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles of business analysts==
As the scope of business analysis is very wide, there has been a tendency for business analysts to specialize in one of the three sets of activities which constitute the scope of business analysis, the primary role for business analysts is to identify business needs and provide solutions to business problems these are done as being a part of following set of activities.

; Strategist
: Organizations need to focus on strategic matters on a more or less continuous basis in the modern business world. Business analysts, serving this need, are well-versed in analyzing the strategic profile of the organization and its environment, advising [[senior management]] on suitable [[policy|policies]], and the effects of policy decisions.

; Architect
: Organizations may need to introduce change to solve business problems which may have been identified by the strategic analysis, referred to above. Business analysts contribute by analyzing objectives, processes and resources, and suggesting ways by which re-design ([[Business process reengineering|BPR]]), or improvements (BPI) could be made. Particular skills of this type of analyst are "soft skills", such as knowledge of the business, [[requirements engineering]], [[stakeholder analysis]], and some "hard skills", such as [[business process modeling]]. Although the role requires an awareness of technology and its uses, it is not an [[Information Technology|IT]]-focused role.

: Three elements are essential to this aspect of the business analysis effort: the redesign of core business processes; the application of enabling technologies to support the new core processes; and the management of [[organizational change]]. This aspect of business analysis is also called "business process improvement" (BPI), or "[[Business process reengineering|reengineering]]".

; IT-systems analyst
: There is the need to align IT development with the business system as a whole. A long-standing problem in business is how to get the best [[return on investment|return]] from IT [[investment]]s, which are generally very expensive and of critical, often strategic, importance. IT departments, aware of the problem, often create a business analyst role to better understand and define the requirements for their IT systems. Although there may be some overlap with the developer and testing roles, the focus is always on the IT part of the [[change management (people)|change process]], and generally this type of business analyst gets involved only when a case for change has already been made and decided upon.

In any case, the term "analyst" is lately considered somewhat misleading, insofar as analysts (i.e. problem investigators) also do design work (solution definers).

The key responsibility areas of a business analyst are to collate the client's software requirements, understand them, and analyze them further from a business perspective. A business analyst is required to collaborate with and assist the business and assist them.&lt;ref&gt;http://businessanalystmentor.com/2009/06/29/why-should-you-become-a-business-analyst/
http://news.dice.com/2013/06/13/5-steps-to-becoming-a-business-analyst/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function within the organizational structure==
The role of business analysis can exist in a variety of structures within an organizational framework.  Because business analysts typically act as a liaison between the business and technology functions of a company, the role can be often successful either aligned to a line of business, within IT, or sometimes both.&lt;ref&gt;IRM, https://irm.com.au/ba-training-roadmap/&lt;/ref&gt;

; Business alignment
: When business analysts work at the business side, they are often subject matter experts for a specific line of business. These business analysts typically work solely on project work for a particular business, pulling in business analysts from other areas for cross-functional projects.  In this case, there are usually business systems analysts on the IT side to focus on more technical requirements.

; IT alignment
: In many cases, business analysts work solely within IT and they focus on both business and systems requirements for a project, consulting with various subject matter experts (SMEs) to ensure thorough understanding.  Depending on the [[organizational structure]], business analysts may be aligned to a specific development lab or they might be grouped together in a resource pool and allocated to various projects based on availability and expertise.  The former builds specific subject matter expertise while the latter provides the ability to acquire cross-functional knowledge.

; Practice management
: In a large organizations, there are centers of excellence or practice management groups who define frameworks and monitor the standards throughout the process of implementing the change in order to maintain the quality of change and reduce the risk of changes to organization. Some organizations may have independent centers of excellence for individual streams such as project management, business analysis or quality assurance. 

A practice management team provides a framework by which all business analysts in an organization conduct their work, usually consisting of processes, [[Procedure (business)|procedures]], templates and best practices. In addition to providing guidelines and deliverables, it also provides a forum to focus on continuous improvement of the business analysis function.

==Goals==
Ultimately, business analysis wants to achieve the following outcomes:
* Create solutions
* Give enough tools for robust project management
* Improve efficiency and reduce waste
* Provide essential documentation, such as [[project initiation document]]s

One way to assess these goals is to measure the [[return on investment]] (ROI) for all projects. According to [[Forrester Research]], more than $100 billion is spent annually in the U.S. on custom and internally developed software projects.  For all of these software development projects, keeping accurate data is important and business leaders are constantly asking for the return or ROI on a proposed project or at the conclusion of an active project. However, asking for the ROI without sufficient data of where value is created or destroyed may result in inaccurate projections.

===Reduce waste and complete projects on time===
{{see also|Project cancellation}}
Project delays are costly in several ways:

* Project costs – For every month of delay, the project team costs and expenses continue to accumulate. When a large part of the development team has been outsourced, the costs will start to add up quickly and are very visible if contracted on a time and materials basis (T&amp;M). Fixed price contracts with external parties limit this risk.  For internal resources, the costs of delays are not as readily apparent, unless time spent by resources is being tracked against the project, as labor costs are essentially ‘fixed’ costs.
* Opportunity costs – Opportunity costs come in two types – lost revenue and unrealized expense reductions. Some projects are specifically undertaken with the purpose of driving new or additional revenues to the bottom line.  For every month of delay, a company foregoes a month of this new revenue stream.  The purpose of other projects is to improve efficiencies and reduce costs.  Again, each month of failure postpones the realization of these expense reductions by another month.  In the vast majority of cases, these opportunities are never captured or analyzed, resulting in misleading ROI calculations.  Of the two opportunity costs, the lost revenue is the most egregious – and the effects are greater and longer lasting.

On a lot of projects (particularly larger ones) the project manager is the one responsible for ensuring that a project is completed on time. The BA's job is more to ensure that if a project is not completed on time then at least the highest priority requirements are met.

===Document the right requirements===
Business analysts want to make sure that they define the requirements in a way that meets the business needs, for example, in IT applications the requirements need to meet end-users' needs. Essentially, they want to define the right application.  This means that they must document the right requirements through listening carefully to ‘customer’ feedback,  and by delivering a complete set of clear requirements to the technical architects and coders who will write the program.  If a [[business analyst]] has limited tools or skills to help him elicit the right requirements, then the chances are fairly high that he will end up documenting requirements that will not be used or that will need to be re-written – resulting in rework as discussed below.  The time wasted to document unnecessary requirements not only impacts the business analyst, it also impacts the rest of the [[development cycle]].  Coders need to generate application code to perform these unnecessary requirements and testers need to make sure that the wanted features actually work as documented and coded. Experts estimate that 10% to 40% of the features in new software applications are unnecessary or go unused.  Being able to reduce the amount of these extra features by even one-third can result in significant savings. An approach of minimalism or "Keep it Simple" and minimum technology supports a reduced cost number for the end result and on going [[Preventive maintenance|maintenance]] of the implemented solution.

===Improve project efficiency===
Efficiency can be achieved in two ways: by reducing rework and by shortening project length.

Rework is a common industry headache and it has become so common at many organizations that it is often built into project budgets and time lines. It generally refers to extra work needed in a project to fix errors due to incomplete or missing requirements and can impact the entire software development process from definition to coding and testing. The need for rework can be reduced by ensuring that the requirements gathering and definition processes are thorough and by ensuring that the business and technical members of a project are involved in these processes from an early stage.

Shortening project length presents two potential benefits. For every month that a project can be shortened, project resource costs can be diverted to other projects. This can lead to savings on the current project and lead to earlier start times of future projects (thus increasing revenue potential).

==Business analysis qualifications==
An aspiring business analyst can opt for academic or professional education.

In 2006, research carried out by CPOM resulted in the press report "Secret rivers found in Antarctic".  The survey used the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[ERS-2]] satellite radar to measure a region in [[East Antarctica]] with some of the oldest, thickest ice on the continent. The survey revealed synchronous changes in ice surface height (both rise and falls) at locations hundreds of kilometres apart. According to CPOM Director, [[Duncan Wingham]], the only conceivable mechanism for the observations was the movement of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4908292.stm |author= Helen Briggs |title= Secret rivers found in Antarctic |publisher= BBC News |date= 19 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

===Literature===
*[[Oedipus|Oedipus's]] downfall is directly linked to arrogance: ''[[Oedipus Rex]]''
*Macbeth suffers from [[hubris]], leading to the murder of [[Duncan I of Scotland]]; he later becomes [[paranoia|paranoid]], leading him to order the deaths of [[Banquo]] and the family of [[Macduff (Macbeth)|Macduff]]: ''[[Macbeth]]''
*[[Hamlet]] is indecisive and self-doubting, which thwarts him in avenging his father's murder.
*[[Victor Frankenstein]] suffers from excessive curiosity and irresponsibility, leading to the creation of the [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] that destroys his life: ''[[Frankenstein]]''
*[[Sigurd]] has a vulnerable spot on his back, where a linden leaf fell as he was bathing in dragon's blood: ''[[Volsunga saga]]'' 
*[[Agamemnon]] acts in greed when he takes [[Briseis]] away from [[Achilles]], losing the warrior's support in the [[Trojan War]]: ''[[The Iliad]]''. Achilles's own flaw was his own arrogance.
*[[Odysseus|Odysseus's]] flaw was an extreme [[Hubris (Ancient Greece)|hubris]] which led him to dishonor the god [[Poseidon]]. (''[[The Odyssey]]'')
*[[Cyrano De Bergerac]], despite his many accomplishments, suffers from self-doubt because of his huge nose which keeps him from pursuing the woman he loves.
*[[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] suffers from extreme depression, as well as extreme boredom due to his huge yet mostly inactive mind: ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''
*[[Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle's]] extreme [[thanatophobia]] eventually transformed him into the vile Lord Voldemort in his pursuit for [[immortality]]. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Harry Potter]]'s worst flaws, as stated by Rowling, are "anger and occasional arrogance." However, within the text, it is implied his flaw might be his heroic desire to save people. (''[[Harry Potter]]'')
*[[Percy Jackson]] has a fatal flaw of excessive personal loyalty, while his girlfriend Annabeth Chase shares the flaw of the legendary Odysseus: hubris. (''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'')
*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''
*In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, [[Jacen Solo|Jacen Solo's]] eventual downfall is linked to his placing the weight of the galaxy on his shoulder in his desire for peace.

===Film===
*In ''[[Rocky]]'', [[Rocky Balboa]] thinks of himself as a loser who cannot go the distance in the boxing ring.
*[[Anakin Skywalker]]'s anger and fear of losing his wife [[Padme Amidala|Padme]] eventually consumes him, leading to his transformation into [[Darth Vader]]. Whereas his mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] compassion and love for his student blinded him to the path Skywalker was taking. (''[[Star Wars]]'')
*In ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Rick thinks of himself as an unfeeling cynic who denies the pain and disappointment from a failed love affair with Ilsa.
*In ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', the detective played by [[James Stewart]] is afraid of heights and has to climb a tower.
*[[Captain Hook]] is obsessed with ''[[Peter Pan]]''
*[[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]], as a replicant, is powerful, but has a very short lifespan: ''[[Blade Runner]]''
*[[Oskar Schindler]] in the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' must overcome his greedy nature and find compassion to sacrifice in order to save his workers

===Television===
*[[B. A. Baracus]] is afraid of flying: ''[[The A-Team]]''
*[[Homer Simpson]] is an alcoholic, not too bright and prone to reckless choices: ''[[The Simpsons]]''
*[[Philip J. Fry]] (usually) has a severe lack of intelligence: ''[[Futurama]]''
*[[Londo Mollari]] yearns to return to the "glory days" of the [[Centauri Republic]]: ''[[Babylon 5]]''
*[[Mr. Spock]] relies heavily on logic and suppresses his more human emotions: ''[[Star Trek]]''
*[[Drake Mallard|Darkwing Duck/Drake Mallard]] has a big ego. ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''
*[[Peter Griffin]] is extremely impulsive and causes many problems for his family and friends: ''[[Family Guy]]''
*[[Zuko]] makes misguided decisions in an effort to gain his cruel father's acceptance: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Aang]] is too carefree and initially attempts to run from his responsibilities rather than face them: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''
*[[Dean Winchester]] relies on family and is devastated when he loses them or they betray his trust: ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''
*[[The Tenth Doctor]] is constantly trying to help and save the lives of others, and sometimes does things out of anger that have dire consequences later: ''[[Doctor Who]]''
*[[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin's]] greatest character flaw was his greed, losing even those who love him over his mad desire for power. He shares this flaw with his former student and lover [[Cora Mills|Cora]]. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') 
*[[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena's]] envy of her younger half-sister [[Regina Mills]] eventually transformed her into the infamous [[Wicked Witch of the West]] as she planned to reverse time and supplant Regina. Even after this plan was thwarted, her envy remained a great character flaw throughout her time on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*After the death of her fiance Daniel Colter, [[Regina Mills|Regina]] suffered a mental breakdown and became consumed with anger, which Rumplestiltskin was able to use to shape her into the Evil Queen who would cast his Dark Curse. Anger, as a fatal flaw, is one she shares with [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Killian Jones]] whose own anger transformed him into vengeful [[Captain Hook]]; however, Hook did not share Regina's mental instability. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*The main character flaw of the protagonist of the series, [[Emma Swan]], are her tendency to mistrust other people, which leads her to put up emotional barriers to protect herself and run when things get difficult. Her overcoming this flaw is a major story arc on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')

===Gaming===
* In [[Warhammer 40,000]], the Primarch Lorgar Aurelian is extremely devout and reveres his "father", the Emperor of Mankind, as a god. The Emperor envisages a human civilization free of the shackles of religion and dogma and chastises Lorgar and his legion for worshipping him. Hurt and depressed by the humiliation of his father's rebuke, Lorgar and the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] of the XVII Legion (the "Word Bearers") search for another purpose to sustain them, and in doing so become the first legion to fall under the malicious influence of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]]. Their devotion to Chaos sees them instigate the devastating civil war known as the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]], the events of which led to the current dystopian setting of Warhammer 40,000.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Liquid's jealousy of Solid Snake's "dominant genes" and his desire to be the better of the two sets much of the story in motion, leading to Liquid's eventual downfall.
*In the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] acts brutally and violently out of anger and desire for revenge, with devastating consequences on his only life and the world around him.

'''Common descent''' describes how, in [[evolutionary biology]], a group of [[organism]]s share a [[most recent common ancestor]].

Common ancestry between organisms of different [[species]] arises during [[speciation]], in which new species are established from a single ancestral population. Organisms which share a more-recent common ancestor are more closely related.

Universal common descent through an [[evolution]]ary process was first proposed by the English [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Charles Darwin]] in the concluding sentence of his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'':

{{quote|There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.&lt;ref name="origin_490"&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
{{See also|History of evolutionary thought}}

In the 1740s, the French [[mathematician]] [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] made the first known suggestion that all organisms had a common ancestor, and had diverged through random variation and [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Crombie |Hoskin |1970 |pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OOgzAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=Maupertuis+%22for+the+first+time%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Maupertuis%20%22for%20the%20first%20time%22&amp;f=false 62–63]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Treasure |1985 |p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Essai de cosmologie'' (1750), Maupertuis noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;May we not say that, in the fortuitous combination of the productions of Nature, since only those creatures ''could'' survive in whose organizations a certain degree of adaptation was present, there is nothing extraordinary in the fact that such adaptation is actually found in all these species which now exist? Chance, one might say, turned out a vast number of individuals; a small proportion of these were organized in such a manner that the animals' organs could satisfy their needs. A much greater number showed neither adaptation nor order; these last have all perished.... Thus the species which we see today are but a small part of all those that a blind destiny has produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Harris |1981 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Fkqg3TIkBJwC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=Essai+de+Cosmologie+%22blind+destiny%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Essai%20de%20Cosmologie%20%22blind%20destiny%22&amp;f=false 107]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1790, the philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] wrote in ''Kritik der Urteilskraft'' (''[[Critique of Judgement]]'') that the similarity{{efn|Now called [[Homology (biology)|homology]].}} of animal forms implies a common original type, and thus a common parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Kant |1987 |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=y5wQD-ioaUUC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=Critique+of+Judgment+%22original+mother%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 304]}}: "Despite all the variety among these forms, they seem to have been produced according to a common archetype, and this analogy among them reinforces our suspicion that they are actually akin, produced by a common original mother."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1794, Charles Darwin's grandfather, [[Erasmus Darwin]], asked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]ould it be too bold to imagine, that in the great length of time, since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the history of mankind, would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which {{Smallcaps |the great First Cause}} endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts attended with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions, and associations; and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down those improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end?&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Darwin |1818 |p=397 [§&amp;nbsp;39.4.8]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]]'s views about common descent, as expressed in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', were that it was probable that there was only one progenitor for all life forms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Darwin |1859 |p=484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Common descent was widely accepted amongst the [[scientific community]] after Darwin's publication.&lt;ref&gt;Krogh, David. (2005). ''Biology: A Guide to the Natural World''. Pearson/Prentice Hall. p. 323. {{ISBN|978-0321946768}} "Descent with modification was accepted by most scientists not long after publication of Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection'' in 1859. Scientists accepted it because it explained so many facets of the living world."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, [[Vernon Lyman Kellogg|Vernon Kellogg]] commented that "practically no naturalists of position and recognized attainment doubt the theory of descent."&lt;ref&gt;[[Vernon Lyman Kellogg|Kellogg, Vernon L]]. (1907). [https://archive.org/stream/darwinismtodaydi00kell#page/3/mode/2up ''Darwinism To-Day'']. Henry Holt and Company. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, biologist [[T. Ryan Gregory]] noted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No reliable observation has ever been found to contradict the general notion of common descent. It should come as no surprise, then, that the scientific community at large has accepted evolutionary descent as a historical reality since Darwin’s time and considers it among the most reliably established and fundamentally important facts in all of science.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, T. Ryan. (2008). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-007-0001-z ''Evolution as Fact, Theory, and Path'']. ''Evolution: Education and Outreach'' 1 (1): 46–52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Evidence==
{{further|Evidence of common descent}}

===Common biochemistry===

All known forms of life are based on the same fundamental biochemical organization: genetic information encoded in [[DNA]], transcribed into [[RNA]], through the effect of [[protein]]- and RNA-[[enzyme]]s, then translated into proteins by (highly similar) [[ribosome]]s, with [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]] and others as energy sources.

The [[genetic code]] (the "translation table" according to which DNA information is translated into [[amino acid]]s, and hence proteins) is nearly identical for all known lifeforms, from [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] to [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s. The universality of this code is generally regarded by biologists as definitive evidence in favor of universal common descent.&lt;ref name=Knight/&gt;

The way that [[Genetic code|codon]]s (DNA triplets) are mapped to [[amino acid]]s seems to be strongly optimised. Richard Egel argues that in particular the [[hydrophobic]] (non-polar) side-chains are well organised, suggesting that these enabled the earliest organisms to create [[peptide]]s with water-repelling regions able to support the essential electron exchange ([[redox]]) reactions for energy transfer.&lt;ref name=Egel&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Egel |first1=Richard |title=Primal Eukaryogenesis: On the Communal Nature of Precellular States, Ancestral to Modern Life |journal=Life |date=March 2012 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=170–212 |doi=10.3390/life2010170 |pmc=4187143 |pmid=25382122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selectively neutral similarities===

Similarities which have no adaptive relevance cannot be explained by [[convergent evolution]], and therefore they provide compelling support for universal common descent. Such evidence has come from two areas: [[amino acid]] sequences and DNA sequences. Proteins with the same three-dimensional structure need not have identical amino acid sequences; any irrelevant similarity between the sequences is evidence for common descent. In certain cases, there are several [[Genetic code|codon]]s (DNA triplets) that code redundantly for the same amino acid. Since many species use the same codon at the same place to specify an amino acid that can be represented by more than one codon, that is evidence for their sharing a recent common ancestor. Had the amino acid sequences come from different ancestors, they would have been coded for by any of the redundant codons, and since the correct amino acids would already have been in place, [[natural selection]] would not have driven any change in the codons, however much time was available. [[Genetic drift]] could change the codons, but it would be extremely unlikely to make all the redundant codons in a whole sequence match exactly across multiple lineages. Similarly, shared nucleotide sequences, especially where these are apparently neutral such as the positioning of [[intron]]s and [[pseudogene]]s, provide strong evidence of common ancestry.&lt;ref name="Sharma2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharma |first=N. S. |title=Continuity And Evolution Of Animals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7Q47fvCfLIC&amp;pg=PA32 |year=2005 |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=978-81-8293-018-6 |pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other similarities===

Biologists often{{quantify|date=March 2018}} point to the universality of many aspects of cellular life as supportive evidence to the more compelling evidence listed above. These similarities include the energy carrier [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), and the fact that all amino acids found in proteins are [[Chirality (chemistry)#In biology|left-handed]]. It is, however, possible that these similarities resulted because of the [[Laws of science|laws of physics and chemistry]] - rather than through universal common descent - and therefore resulted in convergent evolution. In contrast, there is evidence for homology of the central subunits of [[ATPase#Transmembrane ATP synthases|Transmembrane ATPases]] throughout all living organisms, especially how the rotating elements are bound to the membrane. This supports the assumption of a LUCA as a cellular organism, although primordial membranes may have been semipermeable and evolved later to the membranes of modern bacteria, and on a second path to those of modern archaea also.&lt;ref&gt;

===Phylogenetic trees===
{{PhylomapB|size=300px|caption=A [[phylogenetic tree]] based on [[ribosomal RNA]] genes implies a single origin for all life.}}
{{Main |Phylogenetic tree}}
{{See also |Tree of life (biology)}}

Another important piece of evidence is from detailed phylogenetic trees (i.e., "genealogic trees" of species) mapping out the proposed divisions and common ancestors of all living species. In 2010, Douglas L. Theobald published a statistical analysis of available genetic data,&lt;ref name="theobald" /&gt; mapping them to phylogenetic trees, that gave "strong quantitative support, by a formal test, for the unity of life."&lt;ref name="steel" /&gt;

Traditionally, these trees have been built using morphological methods, such as appearance, [[embryology]], etc. Recently, it has been possible to construct these trees using molecular data, based on similarities and differences between genetic and protein sequences. All these methods produce essentially similar results, even though most [[genetic variation]] has no influence over external morphology. That phylogenetic trees based on different types of information agree with each other is strong evidence of a real underlying common descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html#independent_convergence |title=Prediction 1.3: Consilience of independent phylogenies |last=Theobald |first=Douglas L. |work=29+ Evidences for Macroevolution: The Scientific Case for Common Descent |version=Version 2.89 |publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive|The TalkOrigins Foundation]] |accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential objections==

[[File:Tree Of Life (with horizontal gene transfer).svg|thumb|2005 [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] shows many [[horizontal gene transfer]]s, implying multiple possible origins.]]

===Gene exchange clouds phylogenetic analysis===
{{further|Horizontal gene transfer}}

Theobald noted that substantial [[horizontal gene transfer]] could have occurred during early evolution. Bacteria today remain capable of gene exchange between distantly-related lineages. This weakens the basic assumption of phylogenetic analysis, that similarity of genomes implies common ancestry, because sufficient gene exchange would allow lineages to share much of their genome whether or not they [[monophyly|shared an ancestor (monophyly)]]. This has led to questions about the single ancestry of life.&lt;ref name="theobald" /&gt; However, biologists consider it very unlikely that completely unrelated proto-organisms could have exchanged genes, as their different coding mechanisms would have resulted only in garble rather than functioning systems. Later, however, many organisms all derived from a single ancestor could readily have shared genes that all worked in the same way, and it appears that they have.&lt;ref name="theobald" /&gt;

===Convergent evolution===
{{further|Convergent evolution}}

If early organisms had been driven by the same environmental conditions to [[Convergent evolution|evolve similar biochemistry convergently]], they might independently have acquired similar genetic sequences. Theobald's "formal test" was accordingly criticised by Takahiro Yonezawa and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yonezawa |first1=Takahiro |last2=Hasegawa |first2=Masami |title=Was the universal common ancestry proved? |date=16 December 2010 |journal=Nature |volume=468 |issue=7326 |page=E9 |doi=10.1038/nature09482 |pmid=21164432|bibcode=2010Natur.468E...9Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; for not including consideration of convergence. They argued that Theobald's test was insufficient to distinguish between the competing hypotheses. Theobald has defended his method against this claim, arguing that his tests distinguish between phylogenetic structure and mere sequence similarity. Therefore, Theobald argued, his results show that "real universally [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] proteins are [[sequence homology|homologous]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Theobald |first=Douglas L. |date=16 December 2010 |title=Theobald reply |journal=Nature |volume=468 |issue=7326 |page=E10 |doi=10.1038/nature09483|bibcode=2010Natur.468E..10T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Theobald |first=Douglas L. |date=24 November 2011 |title=On universal common ancestry, sequence similarity, and phylogenetic structure: The sins of P-values and the virtues of Bayesian evidence |journal=Biology Direct |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=60 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-6-60 |pmc=3314578 |pmid=22114984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comparative politics''' is a field in [[political science]], characterized by an [[empiricism|empirical]] approach based on the ''[[comparative method]]''. In other words, comparative politics is the study of the domestic politics, political institutions, and conflicts of countries. It often involves comparisons among countries and through time within single countries, emphasizing key patterns of similarity and difference. [[Arend Lijphart]] argues that comparative politics does not have a ''substantive'' focus in itself, but rather a ''methodological'' one: it focuses on "the ''how'' but does not specify the ''what'' of the analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lijphart|first=Arend|year=1971|title=Comparative politics and the comparative method|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=65|issue=3|pages=682–693|jstor=1955513|doi=10.2307/1955513}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, comparative politics is not defined by the object of its study, but rather by the method it applies to study political phenomena. [[Peter Mair]] and [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]] advance a slightly different definition, arguing that comparative politics is defined by a combination of a ''substantive'' focus on the study of countries' political systems and a ''method'' of identifying and explaining similarities and differences between these countries using common concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mair|first=Peter|title=A New Handbook of Political Science|editor=Goodin, Robert E.|editor2=Klingemann, Hans-Dieter|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1996|pages=309–335|chapter=Comparative politics: An introduction to comparative.overview|isbn=0-19-829471-9|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oso/414665/1998/00000001/00000001/art00016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606215002/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oso/414665/1998/00000001/00000001/art00016|archivedate=2011-06-06|df=|access-date=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Richard|year=1991|title=Comparing forms of comparative analysis|journal=Political Studies|volume=39|issue=3|pages=446–462|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119347508/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1991.tb01622.x|last2=MacKenzie|first2=W. J. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose states that, on his definition: "The focus is explicitly or implicitly upon more than one country, thus following familiar political science usage in excluding within-nation comparison. Methodologically, comparison is distinguished by its use of concepts that are applicable in more than one country."&lt;ref name="Rose"/&gt;

When applied to specific fields of study, comparative politics may be referred to by other names, such as for example '''comparative government''' (the comparative study of forms of [[government]]) or '''comparative foreign policy''' (comparing the [[foreign policy|foreign policies]] of different States in order to establish general empirical connections between the characteristics of the State and the characteristics of its foreign policy).

Sometimes, especially in the United States, the term "comparative politics" is used to refer to "the politics of foreign countries." This usage of the term, however, is often considered incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkin, J. [2002 (1995)] "Comparative Methods", in Marsh, D. and G. Stoker (ed.) ''Theory and Methods in Political Science'', Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 249–250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vanBiezen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Biezen|first=Ingrid|authorlink=Ingrid van Biezen|author2=Caramani, Daniele|year=2006|title=(Non)comparative politics in Britain|journal=Politics|volume=26|issue=1|pages=29–37|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118602277/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9256.2006.00248.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Comparative political science" as a general term for an area of study, as opposed to a methodology of study, can be seen as redundant. The political only shows as political when either an overt or tacit comparison is being made.  A study of a single political entity, whether a society, subculture or period, would show the political as simple brute reality without comparison with another society, subculture, or period.

The highest award in the discipline of Comparative Politics is the [[Karl Deutsch]] award, awarded by the [[International Political Science Association]]. So far, it has been given to [[Juan Linz]] (2003), [[Charles Tilly]] (2006), [[Giovanni Sartori]] (2009), and [[Alfred Stepan]] (2012).

==Methodology==
The comparative method is – together with the [[experiment|experimental method]], the [[statistics|statistical method]] and the [[case study]] approach – one of the four fundamental [[scientific method]]s which can be used to test the validity of theoretical propositions, often with the use of empirical data i.e. to establish relationships among two or more empirical variables or concepts while all other variables are held constant.&lt;ref&gt;Lijphart, A. (1971), cit., p. 683&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the comparative method is generally used when neither the experimental nor the statistical method can be employed: on the one hand, experiments can only rarely be conducted in political science;&lt;ref&gt;Hopkin, J. [2002 (1995)], cit., p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand the statistical method implies the mathematical manipulation of quantitative data about a large number of cases, while sometimes political research must be conducted by analyzing the behavior of qualitative variables in a small number of cases.&lt;ref&gt;As Lijphart points out in the article cited above, the experimental and statistical methods share the same logic as the comparative method: they all imply a comparison between cases which differ on the variable which is being studied, while remaining identical on all the other possible variables.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Comparative strategies===
Two major strategies are used in comparative research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://poli.haifa.ac.il/~levi/mlogic.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822123557/http://poli.haifa.ac.il/~levi/mlogic.html |archivedate=2007-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Most Similar Systems Design]]/[[Mill's Method of Difference]]: it consists in comparing very similar cases which only differ in the ''dependent variable'', on the assumption that this would make it easier to find those ''independent variables'' which explain the presence/absence of the dependent variable. Most Similar Systems Design, or MSSD, is very helpful since it compares similar objects, it keeps many otherwise confusing and irrelevant variables in the research constant. In a basic sense, MSSD starts out with similar variables between subjects and tries to figure out why the outcome is different between the subjects.  The main shortcoming that is said about this method is that when comparing countries, since there are such a limited number of them, all potential factors of explanation can never be kept altogether constant.  As such, despite many possibilities of variables, there are only a limited number of cases to apply them to.  There are two methods of applying MSSD, the first being a stricter application and the second being a more loose application. The stricter application implies that a researcher would choose various countries that have a number of similar variables, also called control variables, and would only differ from each other by one single independent variable.  The looser application uses the same general concept, but the researcher chooses countries that have similar characteristics but those characteristics are not strictly matched to a set of control variables.  Because of the complications of so many variables but not enough cases, a second method was devolved to be used in conjunction with MSSD.&lt;ref name="Anckar, Carsten 2008"&gt;Anckar, Carsten.

* [[Most Different Systems Design]]/[[Mill's Method of Similarity]]: it consists in comparing very different cases, all of which however have in common the same ''dependent variable'', so that any other circumstance which is present in all the cases can be regarded as the ''independent variable''.  Most Different Systems Design, or MDSD,  differs from MSSD with focus and the fact that it does not take a strict variable application.  MDSD uses differences between countries instead of similarities between countries as variables because social scientists have found that differences between countries do not explain their possible similarities if they have any.  A more basic idea of MDSD is it takes subjects with different variables within them and tries to figure out why the outcomes between them are similar in the end.  When using MDSD as a comparative research method, scientists look at changing interactions between systems in countries and then after all data is collected, the results are compared between the different systems. If the results obtained from this research differ between each other, the researcher must move up to the system level and switch to the MSSD method.  When using MSSD as a comparative research approach, there is the independent and depend variable that get introduced, specifically the dependent variable being something that is common in all the research subjects and the independent variable which would be the differing characteristic between the research subjects.  MSSD is more precise and strict at finding the differing point along with similarities, but MDSD does not have so many variables and only focuses on finding one similarity or difference between a wide selection of systems.&lt;ref name="Anckar, Carsten 2008"/&gt;

==Some major works in comparative politics==
*[[Aristotle]]
: In his work ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|The Politics]]'', Aristotle compares different "constitutions", by introducing a famous typology based on two criteria: the number of rulers (one, few, many) and the nature of the political regime (good or corrupt). Thus he distinguishes six different kinds of "constitutions": monarchy, aristocracy, and polity (good types), versus tyranny, oligarchy and democracy (corrupt types).
*[[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]]
: In their work, ''The Civic Culture'', Almond and Verba embark on the first major cross-national survey of attitudes to determine the role of political culture in maintaining the stability of democratic regimes.
*[[Robert A. Dahl]]
: ''Polyarchy''
*[[Montesquieu]]
: ''The Spirit of the Laws''
*[[Barrington Moore]]
: In ''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World'' (1966) Moore compares revolutions in countries like England, Russia and Japan (among others).  His thesis is that mass-led revolutions dispossess the landed elite and result in Communism, and that revolutions by the elite result in Fascism.  It is thus only revolutions by the bourgeoisie that result in democratic governance.  For the outlier case of India, practices of the Mogul Empire, British Imperial rule and the Caste System are cited.

Skopcol's purpose is to find possible similarities which might help explain the phenomenon of political revolution. From this point of view, this work represents a good example of a research conducted according to the Most Different Systems Design.

The '''conservation and restoration of photographic plates''' is the process of caring for and maintaining [[photographic plates]] in order to preserve their materials and content. It covers the necessary measures that can be taken by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]], [[curators]], [[Collection manager|collections managers]], and other museum professionals to conserve the material unique to photographic plate processes. This practice includes understanding the composition and agents of deterioration of photographic plates, as well as the [[preventive conservation]] and [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|interventive conservation]] measures that can be taken to increase their longevity. 

__TOC__

==History==

===Composition===

The term [[photographic plates]] refers to a type of [[photograph]] that consists of an image bound to a [[glass]] support. Glass plates emerged as a common support medium for photographic negatives in the mid-nineteenth century. In general, [[Black and White Photography|black-and-white]] photographic negatives are made up of fine silver particles, (or color dyes for color negatives), which are embedded in a thin layer called a [[Binder (material)|binder]]. Combined with the image substance, these two elements make-up what is called the [[emulsion]]. This emulsion layer sits upon what is called the support, which can be paper, metal, film, or as in the case of photographic plates, [[glass]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important part of the photographic process, "fixing," is used to wash the silver particles that are not part of the image, which then produces a stable negative image. This negative image can then be used over many years to produce paper positives. Glass plates as a form of support were popular in use between 1851 and the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Somerset Photography|title=Glass Negatives|url=http://www.somersetphotography.com/glass_negatives.htm|website=History of Photography|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Processes===

[[File:Early wet plate collodion portrait of lady -1 (4984137358).jpg|thumb|Early wet plate collodion portrait of lady]]
* '''Collodion glass plate negative:''' This process was invented by the Englishman [[Frederick Scott Archer]] in 1851. While the first process to take advantage of glass plates was an [[albumen]], it was quite laborious and quickly surpassed by the [[collodion]] glass plate negative in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paris Photo|title=Collodion Glass Plate Negative|url=https://www.parisphoto.com/en/Glossary/Collodion-Glass-Plate-Negative/|website=Paris Photo|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collodion photographic process was a wet place process, which meant that the glass plate itself had to be wet while it was exposed and throughout processing. This required a portable darkroom to be taken wherever a photographer went in order to successfully produce a negative image. During the process, the collodion was the binder which was poured onto the glass plate before being exposed. The glass plate was then [[developed]], [[Fixer (photography)|fixed]], [[Washing (photography)|washed]], and protected with a [[varnish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Gelatin dry plate negative:''' This process was invented by [[Richard Leach Maddox]] in 1871, but it was not commonly used until 1878 when the process became commercially successful. Because of the advances this process made in photography, it soon replaced the [[wet plate process]] in the 1880s. The collodion binder formerly used was replaced by [[gelatin]] which already contained the light-sensitive silver salts. This meant that the emulsion was already present and did not have to be painted on the glass plate right before exposure - which now only took less than one second. Because of this advancement, photographers did not have to carry their portable darkroom, but could develop later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1878 when further improvements were made to the gelatin emulsion, gelatin glass plates began being mass produced by companies such as Wratten &amp; Wainright, Keystone Dry Plate Works, and notably the [[Eastman Dry Plate Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Valverde|first1=Maria Fernanda|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Processes|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|website=Image Permanence Institute|publisher=Advanced Residency Program in Photograph Conservation|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the advanced use and production of photographic glass plates until around 1925 and the development of the modern photography industry.

==Agents of deterioration== 

[[Photographic plates]] face certain challenges to their preservation. In order to protect against deterioration or damage, [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] seek to identify the agents that threaten the various materials that make-up photographic glass plates. The primary agents of deterioration include the following:

===Relative humidity &amp; temperature===

[[Relative humidity]] (RH) and [[temperature]] are two of the most serious threats to photographic plates and can determine their longevity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other cultural collections, an overall high temperature in combination with high humidity can lead to mold growth as well as attract [[pest (organism)|pest]]s. Heat is also a danger to collections because it is an element that accelerates any type of chemical deterioration that occurs, specifically in photographic materials. 

Photographic plates face significant structural and chemical challenges unique to their makeup - Fluctuations in RH can strain the adhesion of the [[gelatin]] to the glass plate as changes can cause the gelatin to expand and contract as well as cause [[emulsion]] to crack or separate along the edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, on a gelatin dry plate, high humidity can cause [[mold]] to grow on the emulsion and cause the plates to stick together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casella|first1=Luisa|title=Gelatin Dry-plate|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Gelatin_Dry-plate|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the relative humidity can cause deterioration of other elements as well such as the silver, [[varnish]], and glass support. Decreasing the RH will cause deterioration by leading to the flaking of the [[Binder (material)|binder]] and [[dehydration]] of the glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light===

Photographic plates, along with all photographic materials, are very sensitive to light. Extensive and ongoing exposure to light can cause significant deterioration that is irreversible. [[Sunlight]] is the most damaging type of light, but indoor lighting and any other [[UV light|UV lighting]] all pose a serious threat to photographic plates causing [[fading]] and [[yellowing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NEDCC Staff|title=5.3 Care of Photographs|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.3-care-of-photographs|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Light]] is especially threatening to [[Color photography|color photographic materials]] since it accelerates the fading of the color dyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Northeast Document Conservation Center|title=Storing Photograph Collections|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-5/5-storing-photograph-collections|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not uncommon for photographic plates to be hand-painted in order to produce color images. Exposure to light of colored glass slides could deteriorate and lead to discoloration of the [[pigments]].

===Air pollution===

[[Air pollution]] can pose a threat to photographic plates through poor [[air quality]] and [[dirt]] that can damage the materials. This can include [[dust]], gaseous pollution from an urban environment, and dirt particulate. Air pollution can cause fading of photographic materials as well as damage the surface of the image by causing an [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]]. Other sources of air pollution include "photocopying machines, construction materials, paint fumes, cardboard, carpets, and janitorial supplies," as well as other types of outdated or obsolete media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NEDCC Staff|title=5.3 Care of Photographs|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.3-care-of-photographs|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Material/chemical===

The glass composition of photographic plates can be a factor of deterioration. Due to poor quality or an [[Inherent_vice_(library_and_archival_science)|inherent vice]], "sick glass" can occur. Environmental conditions are usually linked to the increase or presence of this [[glass corrosion]]. The effect of "sick glass" can be weeping and [[crizzling]] which can be caused by excessive [[alkali]] present and a lack of [[stabilizers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeping involves droplets forming on the glass that appear as small crystals. This type of deterioration is especially threatening for cased photographs because the cover glass could be corroded and damage the photographic image underneath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McElhone|first1=John P.|title=Cased photographs: Including Daguerreotypes, Ambrotypes (Collodion Positives), and Tintypes|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Cased_Photographs|website=AIC Wiki|publisher=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corrosion of the glass plate support can also damage the image layer by causing the lifting of the binder and varnish layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bahnemann|first1=Greta|title=The Preservation of Glass Plate Negatives|url=https://www.webjunction.org/documents/webjunction/The_Preservation_of_Glass_Plate_Negatives.html|website=Web Junction|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The other chemical components of glass plate negatives can also be threatening agents of deterioration. For instance, the silver image layer could possibly undergo [[Oxidation|oxidative deterioration]] which can lead to fading and discoloration. Additionally, the collodion binder itself is made up of [[cellulose nitrate]] which is known to be a flammable compound. While this is very dangerous as a film support, it is not thought to be as threatening in the binder. Most of these agents of deterioration are the result of poor chemical processing, but they are usually exacerbated by poor environmental and storage conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bahnemann|first1=Greta|title=The Preservation of Glass Plate Negatives|url=https://www.webjunction.org/documents/webjunction/The_Preservation_of_Glass_Plate_Negatives.html|website=Web Junction|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avdella, izgorena, 1905.jpg|thumb|Broken glass plate - Avdella, izgorena, 1905]]

===Physical===

Glass plates are rather stable dimensionally, but they are also very fragile and [[brittle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because glass is brittle, it is highly susceptible to [[breakage]], [[Fracture|cracks]], and [[fractures]]. This can be caused by human error including dropping or bumping the glass plate, or it can be caused by failure of storage equipment, housing, shelves, etc. which may lead to an impact to the glass. 

Types of breakage:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* Impact break - point of impact and surrounding radiating arcs
* Cracks - run perpendicular to applied stress
* Blind cracks - breaks do not carry through the whole shard of glass

Certain types of breakage and stress states affect the image layer and binder in different ways.

==Preventive conservation== 

===Environment===

Environmental controls are a crucial part of the preservation of photographic glass plates. [[Relative humidity]] (RH), [[temperature]], and [[light]] play a large role in keeping the multiple materials in photographic glass plates maintained. The following regulatory measures are taken for their preservation:

* For photographic glass plates, the temperature is kept cool at around 65°F approximately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Northeast Document Conservation Center|title=Storing Photograph Collections|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-5/5-storing-photograph-collections|website=NEDCC|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* RH levels are normally kept between 30-40%. If RH goes below 30%, the image binder of the glass plate will [[dehydrate]]. If RH goes above 40%, the glass will begin [[hydrate|hydrating]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For cased glass plate photographs, such as [[ambrotypes]], RH levels are kept between 40-50% and temperature between 65-68°F. These levels differ because of the case and its risk for [[embrittlement]], [[brass]] mat, and glass deterioration. 
* Fluctuations, also called “cycling,” in RH and temperature are sought to be avoided. Environmental fluctuations can contribute to [[mold growth]], chemical deterioration including discoloration and [[yellowing]], as well as deterioration of the emulsion. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Library of Congress|title=Care, Handling, and Storage of Photographs|url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/photolea.html#Structure|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Photographic glass plates, especially [[Negative (photography)|negatives]], are preserved in dark enclosures due to their risk of deterioration when exposed to light, particularly [[UV light|UV]] and [[sunlight]]. If displayed, spot-lighting, which is uneven heating to the photographic plate, is avoided. Light levels are kept below 50 [[lux]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handling===

Photographic glass plates are handled carefully to avoid physical or chemical deterioration and damage – the following aids in their preservation through proper handling: 

* To prevent fingerprints, non-vinyl plastic gloves are worn when handling – either [[Latex]] or [[Nitrile]]. [[Cotton]] gloves are not recommended by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] due to the possibility of glass easily slipping from the cotton material. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When handling, a glass plate is not held by one edge or corner, rather it is held by two opposite edges and always with two hands. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Archives|title=How Do I House Glass Plate Negatives?|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/glass-plate-negatives.html|website=National Archives|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When laying the glass plate on a flat surface, it is always placed with the [[emulsion]] side up. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Archives|title=How Do I House Glass Plate Negatives?|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/glass-plate-negatives.html|website=National Archives|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Glass plates are never stacked or have any pressure placed upon them. The sleeve or enclosure is labeled before placing the glass plate inside. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Archives|title=How Do I House Glass Plate Negatives?|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/glass-plate-negatives.html|website=National Archives|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since glass plates are fragile and brittle, duplicates are created if a glass plate is used often for [[Photo printing|printing]]. This helps to minimize the threat of breakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage=== 

Storage and housing of photographic glass plates is an important part of their preservation. [[Museums]] and other [[cultural institutions]] take the following measures to ensure their glass plates are properly housed: 

* Photographic glass plates are housed in four-flap enclosures, emulsion side up. These four-flap buffered enclosures prevent a glass plate from being pulled in and out and further deteriorating the image through flaking and [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasions]]. Rather, the four-flap enclosure allows the glass plate to be accessed by unfolding the flaps without having to pull the plate across any surface or material. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The photographic glass plates are stored vertically on the long side of the plate in [[acid]]- and [[lignin]]-free storage boxes. The glass plates are not packed too tightly and are sought not to rub against each other. Each one is usually separated individually with stiffeners made of acid-free folder stock or acid-free cardboard in order to support the plates. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaylord Archival|title=Caring for Glass Plate Negatives|url=http://www.gaylord.com/resources/glass-plate-negative-storage|website=Gaylord Archival|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Photographic glass plates stored in a partially filled box will have spacers, most likely [[acid-free]] [[Corrugated fiberboard|corrugated]] [[paperboard]], inserted in order to prevent significant bumping or moving. 
* Glass plates that are larger than 10” x 12” are stored in legal size boxes that are partially filled to prevent a too heavy weight. The extra space in the box is filled with board or spacers to avoid shifting and jostling. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Storage boxes consisting of photographic glass plates are stored on a lower shelf, specifically below four feet. This helps to prevent someone from lifting them down from above his or her head. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each storage box of photographic glass plates is labeled with words such as “Heavy,” “Handle with Care,” “Caution: Contains Glass Negatives,” so that everyone knows to be extra careful when lifting the box off a shelf. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gaylord Archival|title=Caring for Glass Plate Negatives|url=http://www.gaylord.com/resources/glass-plate-negative-storage|website=Gaylord Archival|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Storage of broken photographic plates====
 
Broken or cracked glass plates are stored in a special manner, separate from other photographic plates and in the following ways:

* Broken glass plates are not stacked but stored flat.
* Photographic glass plates that are cracked or have binder damage are stored on sink-mats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Northeast Document Conservation Center|title=Storing Photograph Collections|url=https://www.nedcc.org/preservation101/session-5/5-storing-photograph-collections|website=NEDCC|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with minor flaking are still housed in the four-flap enclosure that is labeled appropriately describing the damage. Glass plates with extensive flaking are stored on sink-mats horizontally and placed in a storage box with a label that reads “Caution: Broken glass.

* Broken glass plate shards are often “sandwiched” in between two pieces of buffered board and then placed inside the four-flap enclosure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Archives|title=How Do I House Glass Plate Negatives?|url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/storage/glass-plate-negatives.html|website=National Archives|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[American Institute for Conservation|AIC]] advises that form-fit support should be created for broken glass shards by cutting out two pieces of 4-ply [[mat board]] that fit to each shard. Then, these pieces are glued to each side of the buffered board with either [[wheat starch paste]] or 3M #415 double-stick tape. By placing each shard in between the form-fit support, this will help to prevent further damage. These broken shards are then placed in individual four-flap enclosures and stored flat with appropriate labeling that warns of their broken condition. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another method of storing broken shards is to place them on sink-mats. If this method is used, each piece is separated with paperboard spacers to prevent the pieces from touching. These paperboard spacers are sometimes attached with [[adhesives]] to the mat so that physical damage does not occur to the shards. They are stored horizontally and placed in a storage box with a label that reads “Caution: Broken glass. Carry Horizontally.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintenance/housekeeping===

Maintenance/[[housekeeping]] of photographic plates requires minimal intervention: 

* For their preservation, light cleaning is carried out occasionally by removing dust with a soft brush. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hendriks|first1=Klaus B.|last2=Iraci|first2=Joe|title=Care of Black-and-White Photographic Glass Plate Negatives - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 16/2|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/care-black-white-photographic-negatives-glass-plate.html|website=Government of Canada|publisher=Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

* [[Conservator-restorer|Conservators]] also keep the surrounding collections area clean of [[dust]], [[pest (organism)|pest]]s, and any other debris that may attract pests. Also, food and drink is not permitted in the storage area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|title=Caring for Your Treasures|url=https://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/photographs#.WsLQ8MPwbIU|website=AIC|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent deterioration from [[air pollutants]], it is helpful for conservators to have the air entering the storage area [[filtered]] and purified, windows closed, [[obsolete]]/outdated media minimized, and enclosures and cabinets used to protect collection objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NEDCC Staff|title=5.3 Care of Photographs|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.3-care-of-photographs|website=NEDCC|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation treatment==

Broken or cracked glass plates make up a large portion of those in need of [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation treatment]]. There are various actions taken in reassembling and restoring these plates using the following materials and methods: 

'''[[Adhesives]]:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (There is no one ideal adhesive to be used)
* [[Paraloid B-72]] - A solution of 50-70% B-72 in a solvent with added [[silica]] is used to reassemble glass plate fragments. It takes 1-2 hours to dry. One issue with this adhesive is that it creates "snowflakes" in between the pieces making an invisible reassembly impossible.
* [[Epoxy resin]] - This adhesive is thought to be very strong and has low shrinkage. An issue with this method is that it yellows over time and is not advisable to be used on glass plates with a collodion binder. This is due to the potential damage to the collodion binder of the reversibility method. 
* [[Cyanoacrylates]] - This adhesive bonds strongly with [[alkaline]] surfaces but is very brittle and only used for temporary repairs.

'''Application:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Wicking]] - This is used by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] to apply the adhesive to the glass with a wooden or glass applicator. A [[capillary]] tube or bottle is used to put the appropriate amount of adhesive on the glass shard without excess. 

'''Backing material:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Silpat™ sheet - This is made of [[silicone]] and [[fibreglass]]; textured and provides air pockets to prevent damage from capillary application; it does not create trauma for the [[emulsion]] side of the glass. 
* Secondary support is used for glass plates broken into many pieces or over 5 x 7 inches in size - A second piece of glass is used with silicone as a material to be inserted as a barrier layer.

'''Repair methods &amp; techniques:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitman|first1=Katharine|title=Preservation of Glass in Photographic Materials|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/PMG_Preservation_of_Glass_in_Photographic_Materials|website=AIC Wiki|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[PhotoShop |PhotoShop Software]] assembly - Virtually assembling broken glass shards through Photoshop by scanning or photographing all pieces is used by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]]. This helps to avoid further damage and deterioration of the glass plate photograph. 
* Inclined assembly - This method involves applying an adhesive to the glass shard interfaces and assembling them on an inclined surface covered with [[Mylar]] or Silpat™. The glass shards are reassembled either by direct application, which involves applying the adhesive directly to the shard interface and attaching it to its corresponding piece; or they are assembled through wicking where the adhesive is applied to the shard interface through capillary action. 
* Vertical assembly - This method is used because of the manner in which the glass shards fit back together, which is the most accurate vertically. This also helps to protect the side of the binder layer. When assembling the pieces vertically, pressure sensitive plastic tape or sticky wax is used to hold the pieces together. The adhesive is not applied until all of the pieces are assembled - this helps to recognize any misalignment before they are adhered together. As the last step, the adhesive is applied through wicking. 
* Light-line - This is often used to insure all of the pieces are aligned. A light-line creates a straight line of light that allows a [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] to see any misalignment by producing a crooked line. Once the pieces are aligned, the light-line will be straight again.

'''The Glass Plate Negative Project at the Heritage Conservation Centre'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tay|first1=Jam Meng|title=The Glass Plate Negative Project at the Heritage Conservation Centre|url=http://resources.conservation-us.org/pmgtopics/2013-volume-fifteen/17-T15_Tay.pdf|website=AIC|publisher=The American Institute for Conservation of Historic &amp; Artistic Works|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The vertical assembly method along with a light-line is used in [http://resources.conservation-us.org/pmgtopics/2013-volume-fifteen/17-T15_Tay.pdf The Glass Plate Negative Project at the Heritage Conservation Centre] as outlined in the [[case study]]. This study shows how [[conservators]] deal with other conservation issues as well including accretions and residue. 
* For instance, while the plates were considered structurally stable, they may have needed surface cleaning. This was completed by using [[Cotton swab|swab]]s dampened with water/ethanol solutions in order to reduce [[stain]]s or do away with any left tape residue.
* Pressure sensitive labels were removed mechanically. 
* [[Conservator-restorer|Conservators]] used Whatman lens tissues to wipe off any other residue marks.

It is different from the main [[vascular cambium]], which is the ring between the wood ([[xylem]]) on the inside (top) and the red bast ([[phloem]]) outside it.]]
'''Cork cambium ''' (pl. '''cambia''' or '''cambiums''') is a [[biological tissue|tissue]] found in many vascular plants as part of the [[epidermis]]. The cork cambium is a lateral [[meristem]] and is responsible for secondary growth that replaces the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] in [[root]]s and [[Plant stem|stem]]s. It is found in woody and many herbaceous [[dicot]]s, [[gymnosperm]]s and some [[monocot]]s (monocots usually lack secondary growth). It is one of the plant's meristems – the series of tissues consisting of embryonic disk (incompletely differentiated) cells from which the plant grows. It is one of the many layers of [[Bark (botany)|bark]], between the cork and primary [[phloem]]. The function of cork cambium is to produce the [[cork (tissue)|cork]], a tough protective material.&lt;ref name=Junikka&gt;Junikka, L. (1994) "Macroscopic bark terminology". ''IAWA Journal'' 15(1): 3–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trockenbrodt&gt;Trockenbrodt, M. (1990) "Survey and discussion of the terminology used in bark anatomy". ''IAWA Bulletin, New Series'' 11: 141–166&lt;/ref&gt;

Synonyms for cork cambium are '''bark cambium''', '''pericambium''' and '''phellogen'''. Phellogen is defined as the meristematic cell layer responsible for the development of the periderm. Cells that grow inwards from there are termed ''phelloderm'', and cells that develop outwards are termed ''phellem'' or cork (note similarity with [[vascular cambium]]). The [[periderm]] thus consists of three different layers:&lt;ref name=Junikka/&gt;&lt;ref name=Trockenbrodt/&gt;
* phelloderm – inside of cork cambium; composed of living parenchyma cells
* phellogen (cork cambium) – meristem that gives rise to periderm 
* phellem (cork) – dead at maturity; air-filled protective tissue on the outside

Growth and development of cork cambium is very variable between different species, and is also highly dependent on age and growth conditions, as can be observed from the different surfaces of bark, which may be smooth, fissured, tesselated, scaly, or flaking off.

== Economic importance ==
[[File:1-Arraiolos-0050.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Quercus suber]]'' (cork oak) bark, Portugal]]

Commercial [[Cork (material)|cork]] is derived from the bark of the [[cork oak]] ''(Quercus suber).'' Cork has many uses including wine bottle stoppers, bulletin boards, coasters, hot pads to protect tables from hot pans, insulation, sealing for lids, flooring, gaskets for engines, fishing bobbers, handles for fishing rods and tennis rackets, etc. It is also a high strength-to-weight/cost ablative material for aerodynamic prototypes in wind tunnels, as well as satellite launch vehicle payload fairings, reentry surfaces, and compression joints in thrust-vectored solid rocket motor nozzles.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Many types of bark are used as [[mulch]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8235">'''Cytotoxicity''' is the quality of being [[toxicity|toxic]] to [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. Examples of toxic agents are an [[immune cell]] or some types of [[venom]], e.g. from the [[Bitis arietans|puff adder]] (''Bitis arietans'') or [[brown recluse spider]] (''Loxosceles reclusa'').

==Cell physiology==
Treating cells with the cytotoxic compound can result in a variety of cell fates. The cells may undergo [[necrosis]], in which they lose membrane integrity and die rapidly as a result of [[cell lysis]]. The cells can stop actively growing and dividing (a decrease in cell viability), or the cells can activate a genetic program of controlled cell death ([[apoptosis]]).

Cells undergoing necrosis typically exhibit rapid swelling, lose membrane integrity, shut down metabolism and release their contents into the environment. Cells that undergo rapid necrosis in vitro do not have sufficient time or energy to activate apoptotic machinery and will not express apoptotic markers. Apoptosis is characterized by well defined cytological and molecular events including a change in the [[refractive index]] of the cell, cytoplasmic shrinkage, nuclear condensation and cleavage of DNA into regularly sized fragments. Cells in culture that are undergoing apoptosis eventually undergo secondary necrosis. They will shut down metabolism, lose membrane integrity and lyse.&lt;ref name=riss1&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riss TL, Moravec RA |title=Use of multiple assay endpoints to investigate the effects of incubation time, dose of toxin, and plating density in cell-based cytotoxicity assays |journal=Assay Drug Dev Technol |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=51–62 |date=February 2004 |pmid=15090210 |doi=10.1089/154065804322966315 |url=|last2=Moravec }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==

Cytotoxicity assays are widely used by the pharmaceutical industry to screen for cytotoxicity in compound libraries. Researchers can either look for cytotoxic compounds, if they are interested in developing a therapeutic that targets rapidly dividing cancer cells, for instance; or they can screen "hits" from initial high-throughput drug screens for unwanted cytotoxic effects before investing in their development as a pharmaceutical.

Assessing cell membrane integrity is one of the most common ways to measure cell viability and cytotoxic effects. Compounds that have cytotoxic effects often compromise cell membrane integrity. Vital dyes, such as [[trypan blue]] or [[propidium iodide]] are normally excluded from the inside of healthy cells; however, if the cell membrane has been compromised, they freely cross the membrane and stain intracellular components.&lt;ref name="riss1"/&gt; Alternatively, membrane integrity can be assessed by monitoring the passage of substances that are normally sequestered inside cells to the outside. One molecule, [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH), is commonly measured using [[LDH assay]]. LDH reduces NAD to NADH which elicits a colour change by interaction with a specific probe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Decker T, Lohmann-Matthes ML |title=A quick and simple method for the quantitation of lactate dehydrogenase release in measurements of cellular cytotoxicity and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity |journal=J. Immunol. Methods |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=61–9 |date=November 1988 |pmid=3192948 |doi= 10.1016/0022-1759(88)90310-9|url=|last2=Lohmann-Matthes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protease biomarkers have been identified that allow researchers to measure relative numbers of live and dead cells within the same cell population. The live-cell protease is only active in cells that have a healthy cell membrane, and loses activity once the cell is compromised and the protease is exposed to the external environment. The dead-cell protease cannot cross the cell membrane, and can only be measured in culture media after cells have lost their membrane integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Niles AL, Moravec RA, Eric Hesselberth P, Scurria MA, Daily WJ, Riss TL  |title=A homogeneous assay to measure live and dead cells in the same sample by detecting different protease markers |journal=Anal. Biochem. |volume=366 |issue=2 |pages=197–206 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17512890 |doi=10.1016/j.ab.2007.04.007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytotoxicity can also be monitored using the 3-(4, 5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide ([[MTT assay|MTT]]) or with 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT), which yields a water-soluble product, or the MTS assay. This assay measures the reducing potential of the cell using a colorimetric reaction. Viable cells will reduce the MTS reagent to a colored [[formazan]] product. A similar redox-based assay has also been developed using the fluorescent dye, [[resazurin]]. In addition to using dyes to indicate the redox potential of cells in order to monitor their viability, researchers have developed assays that use [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] content as a marker of viability.&lt;ref name=riss1/&gt; Such ATP-based assays include bioluminescent assays in which ATP is the limiting reagent for the [[luciferase]] reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fan F, Wood KV |title=Bioluminescent assays for high-throughput screening |journal=Assay Drug Dev Technol |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=127–36 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17355205 |doi=10.1089/adt.2006.053 |url=|last2=Wood }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytotoxicity can also be measured by the [[sulforhodamine B]] (SRB) assay, WST assay and [[clonogenic assay]].

Suitable assays can be combined and performed sequentially on the same cells in order to reduce assay-specific false positive or false negative results. A possible combination is LDH-XTT-NR (Neutral red assay)-SRB  which is also available in a kit format.

A label-free approach to follow the cytotoxic response of adherent animal cells in real-time is based on electric impedance measurements when the cells are grown on gold-film electrodes. This technology is referred to as [[electric cell-substrate impedance sensing]] (ECIS). Label-free real-time techniques provide the kinetics of the cytotoxic response rather than just a snapshot like many colorimetric endpoint assays.

==Prediction==
A highly important topic is the prediction of cytotoxicity of chemical compounds based on 
previous measurements, i.e. in-silico testing.&lt;ref name="Reisfeld2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 13677480| year = 2003| author1 = Dearden| first1 = J. C.| title = In silico prediction of drug toxicity| journal = Journal of computer-aided molecular design| volume = 17| issue = 2–4| pages = 119–27| doi=10.1023/A:1025361621494}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For this purpose many
[[QSAR]] and [[virtual screening]] methods have been suggested. An independent comparison
of these methods has been done within the "Toxicology in the 21st century" project.&lt;ref name="TOX21"&gt;"Toxicology in the 21st century Data Challenge" https://tripod.nih.gov/tox21/challenge/leaderboard.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==In cancer==
[[Chemotherapy]] as a treatment of [[cancer]] often relies on the ability of cytotoxic agents to kill or damage cells which are reproducing; this preferentially targets rapidly dividing cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;Ramin Zibaseresht, Photoactivated Cytotoxins, University of Canterbury, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemotherapy Principles|url=http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/002995-pdf.pdf|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immune system==

''[[Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]]'' (''ADCC'') describes the cell-killing ability of certain [[lymphocyte]]s, which requires the target cell being marked by an [[antibody]]. ''Lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity'', on the other hand, does not have to be mediated by antibodies; nor does ''[[complement-dependent cytotoxicity]]'' (''CDC''), which is mediated by the [[complement system]].

Three groups of cytotoxic [[lymphocyte]]s are distinguished:
* [[Cytotoxic T cell]]s
* [[Natural killer cell]]s
* [[Natural killer T cell]]s

'''Digital artifact''' in information science, is any undesired or unintended alteration in data introduced in a digital process by an involved technique and/or technology. In anthropology and archeology a digital artifact is an artifact that is of a digital nature or creation. For example, a gif is such an artifact.  

Digital artifact can be of any content types including text, audio, video, image, animation or a combination. 

== Information science ==
In information science, digital artifacts result from:
*Hardware malfunction: In computer graphics, [[visual artifact]]s may be generated whenever a hardware component such as the processor, memory chip, cabling malfunctions, etc., corrupts data. Examples of malfunctions include physical damage, overheating, insufficient voltage and [[GPU]] [[overclocking]]. Common types of hardware artifacts are [[Texture mapping|texture]] corruption and [[T-vertices]] in 3D graphics, and [[pixelization]] in MPEG compressed video.
*Software malfunction: Artifacts may be caused by algorithm flaws such as decoding/encoding audio or video, or a poor pseudo-random number generator that would introduce artifacts distinguishable from the desired noise into statistical models.
*[[Compression artifact|Compression]]: Controlled amounts of unwanted information may be generated as a result of the use of [[lossy compression]] techniques. One example is the artifacts seen in [[JPEG]] and [[MPEG]] compression algorithms that produce [[compression artifact|compression artifacts]].
*[[Aliasing]]: Digital imprecision generated in the process of converting analog information into digital space is due to the limited granularity of digital numbering space. In computer graphics, aliasing is seen as [[pixelation]].
*[[Rolling shutter]], the line scanning of an object that is moving too fast for the image sensor to capture a unitary image.
*[[Error diffusion]]: poorly-weighted kernel coefficients result in undesirable visual artifacts.

'''Dyadic developmental psychotherapy''' is a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] treatment method for families that have children with symptoms of [[emotional disorder]]s, including [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]] and disorders of [[Attachment disorder|attachment]].&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman, A. 2008 pp.329-337"&gt;Becker-Weidman, A., &amp; Hughes, D., (2008) "Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: An evidence-based treatment for children with complex trauma and disorders of attachment," Child &amp; Adolescent Social Work, 13, pp.329-337&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally developed by Daniel Hughes as an intervention for children whose emotional distress resulted from earlier separation from familiar caregivers.&lt;ref name="hughes2003"&gt;Hughes, D.

Dyadic developmental therapy principally involves creating a "playful, accepting, curious, and empathic" environment in which the therapist attunes to the child's "subjective experiences" and reflects this back to the child by means of eye contact, facial expressions, gestures and movements, voice tone, timing and touch, "co-regulates" emotional affect and "co-constructs" an alternative autobiographical narrative with the child. Dyadic developmental psychotherapy also makes use of [[Cognitive therapy|cognitive-behavioral]] strategies. The "dyad" referred to must eventually be the parent-child dyad. The active presence of the primary caregiver is preferred but not required.&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

A study by Arthur Becker-Weidman in 2006, which suggested that dyadic developmental therapy is more effective than the "usual treatment methods" for [[reactive attachment disorder]] and [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]],&lt;ref name="bw1"&gt;Becker-Weidman. ''Treatment for Children with Trauma-Attachment Disorders: Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy'', Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal. 23(2), April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bw3"&gt;Becker-Weidman, A., (2006b). Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: a multi year follow-up. in Sturt, S., (ed) New Developments in Child Abuse Research. NY: Nova&lt;/ref&gt; has been criticised by the [[American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children]] (APSAC). According to the APSAC Taskforce Report and Reply, dyadic developmental psychotherapy does not meet the criteria for designation as "evidence based" nor provide a basis for conclusions about "usual treatment methods".&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al." &gt;Chaffin, M. et al.

Saunders  Reply to Letters  Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 381 {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292636}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 research synthesis described the approach as a "supported and acceptable" treatment,&lt;ref name= "Craven"&gt;Craven &amp; Lee, (2006), "Therapeutic Interventions for Foster Children: A systematic Research Synthesis," Research on Social Work Practice, Vol. 16, #3, May 2006, pp. 287-304&lt;/ref&gt; but this conclusion has also proved controversial.&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"/&gt; A 2013 review of research recommended caution about this method of therapy, arguing that it has "no support for claims of effectiveness at any level of evidence" and a questionable theoretical basis.&lt;ref name="mercer2014"&gt;Mercer, Jean (2014). "Examining Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy as a Treatment for Adopted and Foster Children: A Review of Research and Theory", ''Research on Social Work Practice November'', 24(6), pp. 715-724.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical basis==

Dyadic developmental psychotherapy is based on the theory that maltreated infants not only frequently have [[Attachment in children|disorganized attachments]] but also, as they mature, are likely to develop rigid self-reliance that becomes a compulsive need to control all aspects of their environment. Hughes cites Lyons-Ruth &amp; Jacobvitz (1999) in support of this theory. Caregivers are seen as a source of fear with the result that children endeavour to control their caregivers through manipulation, overcompliance, intimidation or role reversal in order to keep themselves safe. Such children may also suffer intrusive memories secondary to trauma and as a result may be reluctant or unwilling to participate in treatment. It is anticipated that such children will try to actively avoid the exposure involved in developing a therapeutic relationship and will resist being directed into areas of shame and trauma. Hughes proposes that an attachment based treatment may be more effective for such foster and adoptive children than traditional treatment and parenting interventions.&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

It is stated that once an infant's safety needs are met (by attachment) they become more able to focus on learning and responding to the social and emotional needs of caregivers. (Schore, 2003ab). Hughes posits that this 'affective attunement', described by Stern (1985) is crucial in the development of both a secure attachment as well as a positive, integrated sense of self. Attunement is a primarily a non-verbal mode of communication between infant and carer, and synchrony in the degree of arousal being expressed, as well as empathy for the child's internal experience. Hughes states "Whether it is a motivational system separate from attachment as is suggested by Stern (2004), or a central aspect of a secure attachment dyad, it remains vital in the child's overall development."&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

The therapy attempts to replicate this or fill in the gaps in a maltreated child's experience.

==Methods==

Firstly the therapist becomes 'non-verbally attuned' with the child's affective state. The therapist then attempts to explore 'themes' with the child whilst remaining attuned. Whilst this is done, the therapist then 'co-regulates' (helps the child to manage) the child's emerging affective states with 'matched vitality affect', and develops secondary affective/mental representations of them which is co-constructed with the child for purposes of integration (the therapist tries to help the child gain a coherent narrative about their experiences and an awareness of the positive aspects of themselves). According to Hughes "The therapist allows the subjective experience of the child to impact the therapist. The therapist can then truly enter into that experience and from there express her/his own subjective experience.  As the therapist holds both subjective experiences, the child experiences both.  As the child senses both, the child begins to integrate them and re-experience the event in a way that will facilitate its integration and resolution."&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt; In the anticipated frequent disruptions, due to the child's traumatic and shaming experiences, the therapist accepts and works with these and then 'repairs' the relationship.

The aim is for the child to be able to construct a new and coherent autobiography that enables the child to be in touch with their inner feelings. "As the therapist gives expression to the child's subjective narrative, s/he is continuously integrating the child's nonverbal responsiveness to the dialogue, modifying it spontaneously in a manner congruent with the child's expressions. The dialogue is likely to have more emotional meaning for the child if the therapist, periodically, speaks for the child in the first person with the child's own words." (Hughes 2004 p18)&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt; The active presence of one of the child's primary caregivers is considered to greatly enhance psychological treatment. However Hughes considers that attachment based treatment can be undertaken with just the therapist.(Hughes 2004 p25)&lt;ref name="hughes2004"/&gt;

==Controversy==
DDP has been criticised for the lack of a comprehensive manual or full case studies to provide details of the process. Its theoretical basis has also been questioned.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; Although non-verbal communication, communicative mismatch and repair, playful interactions and the relationship between the parents' attachment status and that of a toddler are all well documented and important for early healthy emotional development, Hughes and Becker-Weidman are described as making "a real logical jump" in assuming that the same events can be deliberately recapitulated in order to correct the emotional condition of an older child.&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"&gt;Pignotti, M., &amp; Mercer, J. (2007). Holding Therapy and Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy are not supported and acceptable social work interventions: A systematic research synthesis revisited.   Research on Social Work Practice, 17 (4),  pp. 513–519.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarities to certain [[attachment therapy]] practices have also provoked controversy.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; It has been suggested that the therapy appears to use age regression and holding techniques—features of attachment therapy not congruent with [[attachment theory]].&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"/&gt; Becker-Weidman cites Daniel Hughes's 1997 book "Facilitating Developmental Attachment", which contains sections on the use of age regression and holding therapy, as a source document for dyadic developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="bw1"/&gt; The advocacy group [[Advocates for Children in Therapy]] include dyadic developmental psychotherapy in their list of "attachment therapies by another name", and continue to list Hughes as a proponent of attachment therapy, citing statements of his that appear to endorse [[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrenintherapy.org/proponents/hughes.html Advocates for Children in Therapy - Daniel Hughes].&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they cite material from Hughes's website about the use of physical contact in therapy as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"To be effective, the child must be engaged by the therapist at the level of preverbal attunement rather than in a setting of rational discussions.  The therapy must also involve a great deal of physical contact between the child and the therapist and parent.  During much of the most intense therapeutic work, the child is being touched or held by the therapist or parent.  His intense emotions are received, accepted, and integrated into the self."&lt;ref name="Hughes 1997"&gt;Daniel A. Hughes (1997). [https://web.archive.org/web/20070205224739/http://danielahughes.homestead.com/fdaintro.html Facilitating Developmental Attachment: The Road to Emotional Recovery and Behavioral Change in Foster and Adopted Children]. Publisher Jason Aronson Inc. Retrieved 30 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The APSAC Taskforce report on attachment disorder, reactive attachment disorder and attachment therapy, published in 2006, places Hughes and Becker-Weidman within the attachment therapy paradigm and indeed specifically cites Becker-Weidman for, amongst other things, the use of age regression, though not for coercive or restraining practices (p.&amp;nbsp;79). They also describe DDP as an attachment therapy in their November 2006 Reply to Letters.&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply"&gt;Mark Chaffin, Rochelle Hanson and Benjamin E. Saunders | Reply to Letters | Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 381 | {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292636}} "Dr. Becker-Weidman is cited three times in the body of the report, none of which refer to coercive techniques. The first citation references his Web site's assertion that traditional therapies are either ineffective or harmful (p. 78). The second citation references his recommendation that children be encouraged to regress to an earlier age as part of treatment (p. 79). The third citation references his assertions, which we believe are unsupported, about practicing an evidence-based treatment (p. 85)."&lt;/ref&gt; Becker-Weidman had stated in his letter to the Taskforce that it was essential to treat a child at its developmental rather than chronological level, but the Taskforce in its November 2006 Reply to Letters disagreed (p.&amp;nbsp;382).&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply2"&gt;Mark Chaffin, Rochelle Hanson and Benjamin E. Saunders | Reply to Letters | Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 381 | {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman Letter"&gt;Arthur Becker-Weidman, Letter to the Editor, Child Maltreat 2006; 11; 379, {{doi|10.1177/1077559506292632}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taskforce in their ''Reply to Letters'' describe Hughes as "a leading [[Attachment therapy|attachment therapist]]" and cite Hughes (together with Kelly and Popper) as examples of attachment therapists who have more recently developed their practices away from the more concerning attachment therapy techniques (p.&amp;nbsp;383).&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply3"&gt;"Hughes went on to describe how his own practice of attachment therapy has changed during the years, specifically in terms of less emphasis on parental victory in power struggles, less use of holding techniques, and rejection of cathartic or dysregulated ventilation of past trauma in favor of approaches that sound very similar to well-supported gradual exposure techniques. Along with this, he offered some discussion of how he came to reconsider some of his own past attachment therapy practices."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kansas University/SRS ''Best Practices Report'' (2004) considered that dyadic developmental psychotherapy as described by Becker-Weidman, appeared to be somewhat different from that as described by Hughes. They state that in 2004 Becker-Weidman's claim that dyadic developmental psychotherapy was "evidence based" cited studies on [[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]] by Myeroff, Randolph and Levy from the Attachment Center at Evergreen.&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman/Kansas"&gt;Becker-Weidmann, A. (3/7/2004). Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy, retrieved
3/20/2004 from http://www.center4familydevelop.com/developmentalpsych.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uta et al."&gt;Uta M. Walter, U., M. and Petr, C. Best Practices in Children's Mental Health: "Reactive Attachment Disorder: Concepts, Treatment and Research" Produced by the University of Kansas School of Social Welfare in conjunction with Kansas Social Rehabilitation Services pp 10-18&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' model is described as more clearly incorporating researched concerns about 'pushing' children to revisit trauma (as this can re-traumatize victims) and as having integrated established principles of trauma treatment into his approach. Avoiding dysregulation is described by Hughes as a primary treatment goal.&lt;ref name="Uta et al."/&gt;

Prior and Glaser state that Hughes's therapy 'reads' as good therapy for abused and neglected children, though with 'little application of attachment theory', but do not include it in their section on attachment therapy.&lt;ref name="Prior 2006"&gt;Prior, V., and Glaser, D. (2006). ''Understanding Attachment and Attachment Disorders: Theory, Evidence and Practice'', Jessica Kingsley Publishers, Child and adolescent mental health series. | p268 | {{ISBN|1-84310-245-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trowell, while admiring Hughes's clinical skills, stated that "Parents and carers need their own specific parent work and the children and young people need specific work tailored to their needs ... parents with their own unmet attachment needs from childhood may significantly inhibit their ability to speak frankly with, and feel supported by professionals aiming to help their children".&lt;ref&gt;Trowell, J. (2004). Reflections on 'an attachment-based treatment of maltreated children and young people'. Attachment &amp; Human Development, 6(3), 279-283&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the use of facial expressions in attempts at attunement, Trowell noted, "although the therapist may look and feel sad, the young person may see this as a provocation-- either hit out or the therapist may be perceived to be triumphant (the facial expression may be misread)" (p.&amp;nbsp;281). Trowell emphasized the value of many of Hughes's ideas for clinical work, but she concluded that "There is a need for caution. Experienced, well-trained clinicians can, with supervision, take these ideas forward into their clinical practice. But the ideas in [Hughes's 2004 paper] do not provide a sufficient basis for a treatment manual, and are not to be followed uncritically."

==Evidence==
Two research reports by Becker-Weidman, the second being a four-year follow-up of the first, are the only empirical examination of dyadic developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; They reported DDP to be an effective treatment for children with [[Complex post-traumatic stress disorder|complex trauma]] who met the [[DSM IV]] criteria for [[reactive attachment disorder]].&lt;ref name="bw1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bw3"/&gt; The first report concluded that children who received dyadic developmental psychotherapy had clinically and statistically significant improvements in their functioning as measured by the [[Child Behavior Checklist]], while the children in the control group showed no change one year after treatment ended.  The study also used the [[Attachment therapy|Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire]] as a measure,&lt;ref name="bw1"/&gt; which has not been empirically validated for reactive attachment disorder.&lt;ref name="mercer2015" /&gt; Statistical comparisons were performed using multiple [[t-test]]s rather than an [[analysis of variance]]; this has been criticized because t-tests increase the chance of finding any significant differences.&lt;ref name="mercer2015"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mercer J | year = 2015 | title = Revisiting an Article About Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy: The Life Cycle of a Woozle | journal = Child and Adolescent Social Work Journal | doi  = 10.1007/s10560-015-0399-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment group comprised thirty-four subjects whose cases were closed in 2000/01. This was compared to a "usual care group" of thirty subjects, who were treated elsewhere. The published reports on this work do not specify the nature of "usual care" or clarify why the "usual care" group, who were assessed at Becker-Weidman's clinic, did not have treatment there. Treatment consisted of an average of 23 sessions over eleven months.  The findings continued for an average of 1.1 years after treatment ended for children between the ages of six and fifteen years.  There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 1.3 years after the evaluation was completed.

In the follow-up study the results from the original study were maintained an average of 3.9 years after treatment ended. There were no changes in the usual care-group subjects, who were re-tested an average of 3.3 years after the evaluation was completed.

Becker-Weidman's first study was considered by the APSAC Taskforce in their November 2006 Reply to Letters following their main report on attachment therapy.&lt;ref name="Chaffin Reply2"/&gt; The Taskforce had in their original report criticised Becker-Weidman for claiming an evidence base to his therapy, and indeed for claiming to be the only evidence based therapy, where the Taskforce considered no evidence base existed.&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al."/&gt; Becker-Weidman responded to this with an open letter citing his study.&lt;ref name="Letter to the Editor"&gt;Arthur Becker-Weidman | Letter to the Editor | Child Maltreat 2006 No 11 | p379 | 
&lt;/ref&gt; The Taskforce examined the (2006) study, criticized the methodology and stated that although the study was an important first step towards learning the facts about DDP outcomes, it fell far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based.&lt;ref name="Reply p3"&gt;"In our estimation, DDP still does not meet criteria as an evidence-based treatment, although the published findings do raise hopes that DDP may be promising. Examining the study, it shares many of the same limitations noted in the Task Force's evaluation of the Myeroff study (p. 85). For example, the study used a small convenience sample, participants were self-selected into treatment versus comparison conditions, the age range of participants was very broad (5-16), there was no direct statistical analysis of differential group change over time, outcome data were not collected by blind or impartial reporters, and the study utilized completer only rather than intent-to-treat methods. Of course, no study is without limitations; however, the fact remains that a single study with these sorts of major limitations, although a first step, is far short of the criteria that must be met before designating a treatment as evidence based. In general, we believe that designating a treatment as evidence based is a job for an independent treatment review panel (e.g., American Psychological Association, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], Office for Victims of Crime Task Force, Cochrane Collaborative, etc.) applying accepted and established scientific review criteria. None has listed DDP as meeting accepted criteria. Thus, it is our opinion that practitioners should not characterize or advertise DDP as an evidence-based practice at this time." Reply to Letters p3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the Taskforce report and Reply to Letters, Craven &amp; Lee (2006) undertook a literature review of 18 studies of interventions used for foster children and classified them under the controversial Saunders, Berliner, &amp; Hanson (2004) system.&lt;ref name= "Craven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saunders 2004"&gt;Saunders, B.E., Berliner, L., &amp; Hanson, R.F.

Evidence-based practice and policy: Choices ahead. Research on Social Work Practice, 16, pp338-357&lt;/ref&gt; They considered only two therapies aimed at treating disorders of attachment, each of which was represented by a single study: dyadic developmental psychotherapy and holding therapy.&lt;ref name="Becker-Weidman 2004"&gt;Becker-Weidman, A. (2004). Dyadic developmental psychotherapy: An effective treatment for children with trauma-attachment disorders. Retrieved 10 May 2005 from http://www.Center4familyDevelop.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Myeroff&gt;Myeroff et al. (1999)Comparative effectiveness of holding therapy with aggressive children. Child Psychiatry and Human Development, 29, 303-313&lt;/ref&gt; They placed both in Category 3 as "supported and acceptable". This classification means that the evidence basis is weak, but that there is no evidence of harm done by the treatment. The Craven &amp; Lee classification report has been criticized as unduly favourable.&lt;ref name="Pignotti &amp; Mercer"/&gt; This critique noted the absence of a comprehensive manual giving details of the dyadic developmental psychotherapy intervention—one of the necessary criteria for assessment using the Saunders et al. guidelines, and one without which no outcome study can be placed in any of the available categories. Craven and Lee rebutted this paper in a reply that concentrated on holding therapy rather than dyadic developmental psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="Craven &amp; Lee 2007"&gt;Lee, R.E., &amp; Craven, P. (2007). Reply to Pignotti and Mercer: Holding Therapy and Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy are not supported and acceptable social work interventions.  Research on Social Work Practice, 17(4),  pp 520-521.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears from the reports that attachment therapy techniques may have been used in addition to standard DDP. The therapist in Becker-Weidman's study instructed parents to use the "[[Attachment therapy#Parenting techniques|attachment parenting methods]]" of two authors who are described by Jean Mercer as advocating "coercive and intimidating approaches to children in treatment", specifically physical restraint and withholding of food and drink. Because of this deviation from the modern presentation of DDP, Mercer argues that the study cannot be considered a test of DDP in its current form.&lt;ref name="mercer2014" /&gt; Mercer cites Becker-Weidman's research as an example of the [[Woozle effect]], in which "flawed, limited, or exaggerated data" is uncritically repeated and republished until it achieves popular acceptance.&lt;ref name="mercer2015" /&gt;

Emotional regulation is a complex process that involves [[Initiation|initiating]], inhibiting, or modulating one's state or [[Behavior#Psychology|behavior]] in a given situation{{spaced ndash}}for example the subjective experience (feelings), cognitive responses (thoughts), emotion-related physiological responses (for example heart rate or hormonal activity), and emotion-related behavior (bodily actions or expressions). Functionally, emotional regulation can also refer to processes such as the tendency to focus one's attention to a task and the ability to suppress inappropriate behavior under instruction. Emotional regulation is a highly significant function in human life.

Every day, people are continually exposed to a wide variety of potentially arousing [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. Inappropriate, extreme or unchecked emotional reactions to such stimuli could impede functional fit within society; therefore, people must engage in some form of emotion regulation almost all of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Koole, S. L. (2009). The psychology of emotion regulation: An integrative review. (23 ed., Vol. 1, pp. 4-41). Psychology Press. Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699930802619031&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, [[emotional dysregulation]] has been defined as difficulties in controlling the influence of emotional [[arousal]] on the organization and quality of thoughts, actions, and interactions. Individuals who are emotionally dysregulated exhibit patterns of responding in which there is a mismatch between their goals, responses, and/or modes of expression, and the demands of the [[social environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Cassano | first2 = M. | last3 = Perry-Parrish | first3 = C. | last4 = Stegall | first4 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Emotion regulation in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 155–168 | doi=10.1097/00004703-200604000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there is a significant association between emotion dysregulation and symptoms of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], [[Eating disorder|eating pathology]], and [[substance abuse]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Aldao, A., Nolen-Hoeksema, S., &amp; Schweizer, S.

==Theory==

===Process model===
The process model of emotion regulation is based upon the modal model of emotion. The modal model of emotion suggests that the emotion generation process occurs in a particular sequence over time. This sequence occurs as follows:
#Situation: the sequence begins with a situation (real or imagined) that is emotionally relevant.
#[[Attention]]: attention is directed towards the emotional situation.
#[[Cognitive appraisal|Appraisal]]: the emotional situation is evaluated and interpreted.
#Response: an emotional response is generated, giving rise to loosely coordinated changes in experiential, behavioral, and physiological response systems.
Because an emotional response (4.) can cause changes to a situation (1.), this model involves a feedback loop from (4.) Response to (1.) Situation. This feedback loop suggests that the emotion generation process can occur recursively, is ongoing, and dynamic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gross, J. J. &amp; Thompson, R. A. (2007). Emotion regulation: Conceptual foundations. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 3-24). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process model contends that each of these four points in the emotion generation process can be subjected to regulation. From this conceptualization, the process model posits five different families of emotion regulation that correspond to the regulation of a particular point in the emotion generation process. They occur in the following order:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = J. J. | year = 1998 | title = The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 271–299 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Situation selection
#Situation modification
#Attentional deployment
#Cognitive change
#Response modulation
The process model also divides these emotion regulation strategies into two categories: antecedent-focused and response-focused. Antecedent-focused strategies (i.e., situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, and cognitive change) occur before an emotional response is fully generated. Response-focused strategies (i.e., response modulation) occur after an emotional response is fully generated.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = J. J. | year = 1998 | title = Antecedent- and response-focused emotion regulation: Divergent consequences for experience, expression, and physiology | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 224–237 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.1.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==

===Situation selection===
Situation selection involves choosing to avoid or approach an emotionally relevant situation. If a person selects to avoid or disengage from an emotionally relevant situation, he or she is decreasing the likelihood of experiencing an emotion. Alternatively, if a person selects to approach or engage with an emotionally relevant situation, he or she is increasing the likelihood of experiencing an emotion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Typical examples of situation selection may be seen interpersonally, such as when a parent removes his or her child from an emotionally unpleasant situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fox | first1 = N. A. | last2 = Calkins | first2 = S. D. | year = 2003 | title = The development of self-control of emotion: Intrinsic and extrinsic influences | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 7–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of situation selection may also be seen in psychopathology. For example, avoidance of social situations to regulate emotions is particularly pronounced for those with [[social anxiety disorder]]&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = A. | last2 = Papageorgiou | first2 = C. | year = 1998 | title = Social phobia: Effects of external attention on anxiety, negative beliefs, and perspective taking | url = | journal = Behavior Therapy | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 357–370 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(98)80037-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[avoidant personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Effective situation selection is not always an easy task. For instance, humans display difficulties [[Affective forecasting|predicting their emotional responses]] to future events. Therefore, they may have trouble making accurate and appropriate decisions about which emotionally relevant situations to approach or to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;Loewenstein, G. (2007). Affect regulation and affective forecasting. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation ''(pp.180-203). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation modification===
Situation modification involves efforts to modify a situation so as to change its emotional impact.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Situation modification refers specifically to altering one's external, physical environment. Altering one's "internal" environment to regulate emotion is called cognitive change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Examples of situation modification may include injecting humor into a speech to elicit laughter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofmann | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Gerlach | first2 = A. L. | last3 = Wender | first3 = A. | last4 = Roth | first4 = W T. | year = 1997 | title = Speech disturbances and gaze behavior during public speaking in subtypes of social phobia | url = | journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders | volume = 11 | issue = 6| pages = 573–585 | doi=10.1016/s0887-6185(97)00040-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or extending the physical distance between oneself and another person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edelmann | first1 = R.

===Attentional deployment===
Attentional deployment involves directing one's attention towards or away from an emotional situation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Distraction====
[[Distraction]], an example of attentional deployment, is an early selection strategy, which involves diverting one's attention away from an emotional stimulus and towards other content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheppes | first1 = G. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2011 | title = Is timing everything?

This is because distraction easily filters out high-intensity emotional content, which would otherwise be relatively difficult to appraise and process.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheppes | first1 = G. | last2 = Scheibe | first2 = S. | last3 = Suri | first3 = G. | last4 = Gross | first4 = J.

====Rumination====
[[Rumination (psychology)|Rumination]], an example of attentional deployment,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; is defined as the passive and repetitive focusing of one's attention on one's symptoms of distress and the causes and consequences of these symptoms. Rumination is generally considered to be a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy, as it tends to exacerbate emotional distress. It has also been implicated in a host of disorders including [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nolen-Hoeksema | first1 = S. | last2 = Wisco | first2 = B. E. | last3 = Lyubomirsky | first3 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Rethinking rumination | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 400–424 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00088.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Worry====
[[Worry]], an example of attentional deployment,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; involves directing attention to thoughts and images concerned with potentially negative events in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borkovec | first1 = T. D. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. | last3 = Pruzinsky | first3 = T. | last4 = DePree | first4 = J. A. | year = 1983 | title = Preliminary exploration of worry: Some characteristics and processes | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 9–16 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(83)90121-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By focusing on these events, worrying serves to aid in the downregulation of intense negative emotion and physiological activity.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; While worry may sometimes involve problem solving, incessant worry is generally considered maladaptive, being a common feature of [[anxiety disorders]], particularly [[generalized anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borkovec | first1 = T. D. | last2 = Inz | first2 = J. | year = 1990 | title = The nature of worry in generalized anxiety disorder: A predominance of thought activity | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 153–158 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(90)90027-g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thought suppression====
[[Thought suppression]], an example of attentional deployment, involves efforts to redirect one's attention from specific thoughts and mental images to other content so as to modify one's emotional state.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Campbell-Sills, L. &amp; Barlow, D. H. (2007). Incorporating emotion regulation into conceptualizations and treatments of anxiety and mood disorders. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 542-559). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although thought suppression may provide temporary relief from undesirable thoughts, it may ironically end up spurring the production of even more unwanted thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Zanakos | first2 = S. | year = 1994 | title = Chronic thought suppression | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 615–640 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1994.tb00311.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy is generally considered maladaptive, being most associated with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Cognitive change===
Cognitive change involves changing how one appraises a situation so as to alter its emotional meaning.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Reappraisal====
Reappraisal, an example of cognitive change, is a late selection strategy, which involves reinterpreting the meaning of an event so as to alter its emotional impact.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, this might involve reinterpreting an event by broadening one's perspective to see "the bigger picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schartau | first1 = P. E. | last2 = Dalgleish | first2 = T. | last3 = Dunn | first3 = B.

As opposed to distraction, individuals show a relative preference to engage in reappraisal when facing stimuli of low negative emotional intensity because these stimuli are relatively easy to appraise and process.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Reappraisal is generally considered to be an adaptive emotion-regulation strategy. Compared to suppression, which is correlated negatively with many psychological disorders,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; reappraisal can be associated with better interpersonal outcomes, and can be positively related to wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gross, James |author2=John, Oliver |title=Individual differences in two emotion regulation processes: Implications for affect, relationships, and well-being|pmid=12916575|url=http://doi.apa.org/journals/psp/85/2/348.pdf|year=2003|volume=85|issue=2|pages=348–62|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.348}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some researchers argue that context is important when evaluating the adaptiveness of a strategy, suggesting that in some contexts reappraisal may be maladaptive.&lt;ref name="Tamir, M. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tamir | first1 = M | year = 2009 | title = What do people want to feel and why?

====Distancing====
Distancing, an example of cognitive change, involves taking on an independent, third-person perspective when evaluating an emotional event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ochsner | first1 = K. N. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2008 | title = Cognitive emotion regulation: Insights from social, cognitive, affective neuroscience | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 153–158 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00566.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distancing has been shown to be an adaptive form of self-reflection, facilitating the emotional processing of negatively valenced stimuli,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayduk | first1 = O. | last2 = Kross | first2 = E. | year = 2009 | title = Asking why from a distance facilitates emotional processing: A reanalysis of Wimalaweera and Moulds (2008) | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 88–92 | doi=10.1016/j.brat.2008.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing emotional and cardiovascular reactivity to negative stimuli, and increasing problem-solving behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayduk | first1 = O. | last2 = Kross | first2 = E. | year = 2010 | title = From a distance: Implications of spontaneous self-distancing for adaptive self-reflection | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 5| pages = 809–829 | doi=10.1037/a0019205 | pmid=20438226 | pmc=2881638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Humor====
[[Humor]], an example of cognitive change, has been shown to be an effective emotion regulation strategy. Specifically, positive, good-natured humor has been shown to effectively upregulate positive emotion and downregulate negative emotion. On the other hand, negative, mean-spirited humor is less effective in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Samson | first1 = A. C. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2012 | title = Humour as emotion regulation: The differential consequences of negative versus positive humour | url = | journal = Cognition and Emotion | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 375–384 | doi=10.1080/02699931.2011.585069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response modulation===
Response modulation involves attempts to directly influence experiential, behavioral, and physiological response systems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Expressive suppression====
[[Expressive Suppression|Expressive suppression]], an example of response modulation, involves inhibiting emotional expressions. It has been shown to effectively reduce facial expressivity, subjective feelings of positive emotion, heart rate, and [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic activation]]. However, the research is mixed regarding whether this strategy is effective for downregulating negative emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dan-Glauser | first1 = E. S. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2011 | title = The temporal dynamics of two response-focused forms of emotion regulation: Experiential, expressive, and autonomic consequences | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 1309–1322 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2011.01191.x| pmc = 3136552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that expressive suppression may have negative social consequences, correlating with reduced personal connections and greater difficulties forming relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Egloff | first2 = B. | last3 = Wlhelm | first3 = F. H. | last4 = Smith | first4 = N. C. | last5 = Erickson | first5 = E. A. | last6 = Gross | first6 = J. J. | year = 2003 | title = The social consequences of expressive suppression | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 48–67 | doi = 10.1037/1528-3542.3.1.48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expressive suppression is generally considered to be a maladaptive emotion-regulation strategy. Compared to reappraisal, it is correlated positively with many psychological disorders,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; associated with worse interpersonal outcomes, is negatively related to wellbeing,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and requires the mobilization of a relatively substantial amount of cognitive resources.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Jane|title=The Cognitive Consequences of Concealing Feelings|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2004|volume=13|issue=4|pages=131–134|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00291.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some researchers argue that context is important when evaluating the adaptiveness of a strategy, suggesting that in some contexts suppression may be adaptive.&lt;ref name="Tamir, M. 2009"/&gt;

====Drug use====
[[Drug]] use, an example of response modulation, can be a way to alter emotion-associated physiological responses. For example, [[Ethanol|alcohol]] can produce [[sedative]] and [[anxiolytic]] effects&lt;ref&gt;Sher, K. J. &amp; Grekin, E. R. (2007). Alcohol and affect regulation. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 560-580). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[beta blockers]] can affect sympathetic activation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Exercise====
[[Exercise]], an example of response modulation, can be used to downregulate the physiological and experiential effects of negative emotions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Regular physical activity has also been shown to reduce emotional distress and improve emotional control.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oaten|first=Megan|author2=Cheng, Ken|title=Longitudinal gains in self-regulation from regular physical exercise|journal=British Journal of Health Psychology|year=2006|volume=11|issue=4|pages=717–733|doi=10.1348/135910706X96481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sleep====
[[Sleep]] plays a role in emotion regulation, although stress and worry can also interfere with sleep. Studies have shown that sleep, specifically [[REM sleep]], down-regulates reactivity of the [[amygdala]], a brain structure known to be involved in the processing of emotions, in response to previous emotional experiences.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=Matthew P. |date=March 2009 |title=The Role of Sleep in Cognition and Emotion |url=http://walkerlab.berkeley.edu/reprints/Walker_NYAS_2009.pdf |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1156 |pages=168–197 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04416.x |access-date=25 November 2015 |pmid=19338508}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the flip side, [[sleep deprivation]] is associated with greater emotional reactivity or overreaction to negative and stressful stimuli. This is a result of both increased amygdala activity and a disconnect between the amygdala and the [[prefrontal cortex]], which regulates the amygdala through inhibition, together resulting in an overactive emotional brain.&lt;ref name="walker"/&gt; Due to the subsequent lack of emotional control, sleep deprivation may be associated with depression, [[impulsivity]], and mood swings. Additionally, there is some evidence that sleep deprivation may reduce emotional reactivity to positive stimuli and events and impair [[emotion recognition]] in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beattie |first=Louise |last2=Kyle |first2=Simon D. |last3=Espie |first3=Colin A. |last4=Biello |first4=Stephany M. |date=December 2015 |title=Social interactions, emotion and sleep: A systematic review and research agenda |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079214001579 |journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews |volume=24 |pages=83–100 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2014.12.005 |access-date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotion-regulation strategies are taught, and emotion-regulation problems are treated, in a variety of approaches to [[counseling]] and [[psychotherapy]], including [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), [[emotion-focused therapy]] (EFT), and [[mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]] (MBCT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berking |first1=Matthias |authorlink1=Matthias Berking |last2=Wupperman |first2=Peggilee |last3=Reichardt |first3=Alexander |last4=Pejic |first4=Tanja |last5=Dippel |first5=Alexandra |last6=Znoj |first6=Hansjörg |date=November 2008 |title=Emotion-regulation skills as a treatment target in psychotherapy |journal=[[Behaviour Research and Therapy]] |volume=46 |issue=11 |pages=1230–1237 |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2008.08.005 |pmid=18835479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kring |editor1-first=Ann M. |editor2-last=Sloan |editor2-first=Denise M. |date=2010 |title=Emotion Regulation and Psychopathology: A Transdiagnostic Approach to Etiology and Treatment |location=New York |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |isbn=9781606234501 |oclc=319318901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental process==

===Infancy===
Intrinsic emotion-regulation efforts during [[infancy]] are believed to be guided primarily by innate physiological response systems.&lt;ref&gt;Derryberr, D., &amp; Rothbart, M. K. (2001). Early temperament and emotional development. In A. F. Kalverboer &amp; A. Gramsbergen (Eds.), ''Handbook of Brain and Behavior in Human Development'' (pp. 967-988). Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; These systems usually manifest as an approach towards and an avoidance of pleasant or unpleasant stimuli. At three months, infants can engage in self-soothing behaviors like sucking and can reflexively respond to and signal feelings of distress.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Rothbart, M., Ziaie, H., &amp; O'Boyle, C. (1992). Self-regulation and emotion in infancy. In N. Eisenberg, &amp; R. Fabes (Eds.), ''Emotion and Its Regulation in Early Development'' (pp. 7-23). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass/Pfeiffer.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, infants have been observed attempting to suppress anger or sadness by knitting their brow or compressing their lips.&lt;ref name="Malatesta et. al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malatesta|first=C.Z.|author2=Grigoryev, P. |author3=Lamb, C. |author4=Albin, M. |author5=Culver, C. |title=Emotional socialization and expressive development in preterm and full-term infants|journal=Child Development|year=1986|volume=57|pages=316–330|doi=10.2307/1130587|pmid=3956316|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between three and six months, basic [[Motor skills|motor functioning]] and attentional mechanisms begin to play a role in emotion regulation, allowing infants to more effectively approach or avoid emotionally relevant situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kochanska | first1 = G. | last2 = Coy | first2 = K.

Extrinsic emotion-regulation efforts by caregivers, including situation selection, modification, and distraction, are particularly important for infants.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Calkins, S. D., &amp; Hill, A. (2007). Caregiver influence on emerging emotion regulation: Biological and environmental transactions in early development. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 229-248). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotion regulation strategies employed by caregivers to attenuate distress or to upregulate positive affect in infants can impact the infants' emotional and behavioral development, teaching them particular strategies and methods of regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Sroufe, L. A. (1996). ''Emotional development: The organization of emotional life in the early years''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The type of [[Attachment styles|attachment style]] between caregiver and infant can therefore play a meaningful role in the regulatory strategies infants may learn to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kochanska | first1 = G | year = 2001 | title = Emotional development in children with different attachment histories: The first three years | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 474–490 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent evidence supports the idea that maternal singing has a positive effect on affect regulation in infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trehub | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Ghazban | first2 = N. | last3 = Corbeil | first3 = M. | year = 2015 | title = Musical affect regulation in infancy | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1337 | issue = 1| pages = 186–192 | doi=10.1111/nyas.12622 | pmid=25773634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing play-songs, such as "The Wheels on the Bus" or "She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain" have a visible affect-regulatory consequence of prolonged positive affect and even alleviation of distress. In addition to proven facilitation of social bonding, when combined with movement and/or rhythmic touch, maternal singing for affect regulation has possible applications for infants in the NICU and for adult caregivers with serious personality or adjustment difficulties.

===Toddler-hood===
By the end of the first year, [[toddler]]s begin to adopt new strategies to decrease negative arousal. These strategies can include rocking themselves, chewing on objects, or moving away from things that upset them.&lt;ref name="Kopp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopp|first=C.B.|title=Regulation of distress and negative emotions|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1989|volume=25|pages=343–354|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.25.3.343|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At two years, toddlers become more capable of actively employing emotion regulation strategies.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; They can apply certain emotion regulation tactics to influence various emotional states.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Additionally, maturation of brain functioning and language and motor skills permits toddlers to manage their emotional responses and levels of arousal more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rueda, M. R., Posner, M. I., &amp; Rothbart, M. K. (2004). Attentional control and self-regulation. In R. F. Baumeister &amp; K. D. Vohs (Eds.),'' Handbook of self-regulation: Research, theory, and applications ''(pp. 283-300). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extrinsic emotion regulation remains important to emotional development in toddlerhood. Toddlers can learn ways from their caregivers to control their emotions and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kopp | first1 = C. | year = 1989 | title = Regulation of distress and negative emotions: A developmental view | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 243–254 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.25.3.343}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, caregivers help teach self-regulation methods by distracting children from unpleasant events (like a [[vaccination]] shot) or helping them understand frightening events.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=R.A.|title=Emotional regulation: A theme in search of definition|journal=Monographs of Society for Research in Child Development|year=1994|volume=59|pages=2–3|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5834.1994.tb01276.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===
Emotion-regulation knowledge becomes more substantial during childhood. For example, children aged six to ten begin to understand [[display rules]]. They come to appreciate the contexts in which certain emotional expressions are socially most appropriate and therefore ought to be regulated. For example, children may understand that upon receiving a gift they should display a smile, irrespective of their actual feelings about the gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = P. L. | year = 1983 | title = Children's understanding of the link between situation and emotion | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1016/0022-0965(83)90048-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During childhood, there is also a trend towards the use of more cognitive emotion regulation strategies, taking the place of more basic distraction, approach, and avoidance tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Stegge, H. &amp; Terwog, M. M. (2007). Awareness and regulation of emotion in typical and atypical development. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 269-286). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the development of emotion dysregulation in children, one robust finding suggests that children who are frequently exposed to negative emotion at home will be more likely to display, and have difficulties regulating, high levels of negative emotion.&lt;ref name="Caspi et. al, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caspi|first=A.|author2=Moffitt, T.E. |author3=Morgan, J. |author4=Rutter, M. |author5=Taylor, A. |author6=Arseneault, L. |author7=Tully, L. |author8=Jacobs, C. |author9=Kim-Cohen, J. |author10=Polo-Tomas, M. |title=Maternal expressed emotion predicts children's antisocial behaviour problems: Using monozygotic-twin differences to identify environmental effects on behavioural development|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2004|volume=40|pages=149–161|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.2.149|pmid=14979757|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenberg, Zhou &amp; Koller, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=N.|author2=Zhou, Q. |author3=Koller, S. |title=Brazilian adolescents' prosocial moral judgement and behaviour: Relations to sympathy, perspective-taking, gender-role orientation, and demographic characteristics|journal=Child Development|year=2001|volume=72|pages=518–534|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00294|pmid=11333082|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maughan &amp; Cicchetti"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maughan|first=A.|author2=Cicchetti, D.|title=Impact of child maltreatment and interadult violence on children's emotional regulation abilities and socioemotional adjustements|journal=Child Development|year=2002|volume=73|pages=1525–1542|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00488|pmid=12361317|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valiente, Eisenberg &amp; Spinrad, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valiente|first=C.|author2=Fabes, R.A. |author3=Eisenberg, N. |author4=Spinrad, T.L. |title=The relations of parental expressivity and support to children's coping with daily stress|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|year=2004|volume=18|pages=97–106|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.18.1.97|pmid=14992613|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence===
[[Adolescence|Adolescents]] show a marked increase in their capacities to regulate their emotions, and emotion-regulation decision making becomes more complex, depending on multiple factors. In particular, the significance of interpersonal outcomes increases for adolescents. When regulating their emotions, adolescents are therefore likely to take into account their social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Cassano | first2 = M. | last3 = Perry-Parrish | first3 = C. | last4 = Stegall | first4 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Emotion regulation in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 155–168 | doi=10.1097/00004703-200604000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, adolescents show a tendency to display more emotion if they expect a sympathetic response from their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Garber | first2 = J. | year = 1996 | title = Display rules for anger, sadness, and pain: it depends on who is watching | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 957–973 | doi=10.2307/1131873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, spontaneous use of cognitive emotion-regulation strategies increases during adolescence, which is evidenced both by self-report data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garnefski | first1 = N. | last2 = Kraaij | first2 = V. | year = 2006 | title = Relationships between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and depressive symptoms: A comparative study of five specific samples | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 1659–1669 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2005.12.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and neural markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luna | first1 = B. | last2 = Padmanabhan | first2 = A. | last3 = O'Hearn | first3 = K. | year = 2010 | title = What has fMRI told us about the development of cognitive control through adolescence? | url = | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 101–113 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandc.2009.08.005 | pmc = 2815087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adulthood===
Social losses increase and health tends to decrease as people age. As people get older their motivation to seek emotional meaning in life through social ties tends to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carstensen | first1 = L. A.

==Overview of perspectives==

===Neuropsychological perspective===

====Affective====
As people age, their [[affect (psychology)|affect]]{{spaced ndash}}the way they react to emotions{{spaced ndash}}changes, either positively or negatively. Studies show that positive affect increases as a person grows from adolescence to their mid 70s. Negative affect, on the other hand, decreases until the mid 70s. Studies also show that emotions differ in adulthood, particularly affect (positive or negative). Although some studies found that affect decreases{{Clarify|reason=Becomes less positive / more negative or rather becomes less extreme, i.e., less positive or less negative as applicable?|date=February 2017}} with age, some have concluded that adults in their middle age experience more positive affect and less negative affect than younger adults. Positive affect was also higher for men than women while the negative affect was higher for women than it was for men and also for single people. A reason that older people{{spaced ndash}}middle adulthood{{spaced ndash}}might have less negative affect is because they have overcome, "the trials and vicissitudes of youth, they may increasingly experience a more pleasant balance of affect, at least up until their mid-70s". Positive affect might rise during middle age but towards the later years of life{{spaced ndash}}the 70s{{spaced ndash}}it begins to decline while negative affect also does the same. This might be due to failing health, reaching the end of their lives and the death of friends and relatives.&lt;ref name="Labouvie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Labouvie-Vief|first=Gisela|title=Dynamic Integration:Affect, Cognition and the Self in Adulthood|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=December 2003|volume=12|issue=6|pages=201–206|doi=10.1046/j.0963-7214.2003.01262.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to [[Reference range|baseline]] levels of positive and negative affect, studies have found individual differences in the time-course of emotional responses to [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. The [[Time|temporal]] dynamics of emotional regulation, also known as affective [[chronometry]], include two key variables in the emotional response process: rise time to peak emotional response, and recovery time to baseline levels of emotion.&lt;ref name="Davidson, R. J. 1998 pp. 307-330"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davidson, R. J. |title= Affective Style and Affective Disorders: Perspectives from Affective Neuroscience|journal= Cognition and Emotion|volume= 12|year=1998|pages=307–330|doi=10.1080/026999398379628|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of affective chronometry typically separate positive and negative affect into distinct categories, as previous research has shown (despite some correlation) the ability of humans to experience changes in these categories independently of one another.&lt;ref&gt;Ruef, Anna Marie; Levenson, Robert W. Coan, James A. (Ed); Allen, John J. B. (Ed) "Continuous measurement of emotion: The affect rating dial" (2007). Handbook of emotion elicitation and assessment. Series in affective science., New York, NY, US: Oxford University Press, pp. 287–297.&lt;/ref&gt; Affective chronometry research has been conducted on clinical populations with [[anxiety]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], and [[personality disorders]], but is also utilized as a measurement to test the effectiveness of different therapeutic techniques (including [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] training) on [[emotional dysregulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geschwind N.|pmid=21767001|year=2011|last2=Peeters|first2=F|last3=Drukker|first3=M|last4=Van Os|first4=J|last5=Wichers|first5=M|title=Mindfulness training increases momentary positive emotions and reward experience in adults vulnerable to depression: A randomized controlled trial|volume=79|issue=5|pages=618–28|doi=10.1037/a0024595|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neurological====
The development of functional [[magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance]] imaging has allowed for the study of emotion regulation on a biological level. Specifically, research over the last decade strongly suggests that there is a neural basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = DW | last2 = Dewitt | first2 = M | last3 = Hudgens-Haney | first3 = ME | last4 = Schaeffer | first4 = DJ | last5 = Ball | first5 = BH | last6 = Schwarz | first6 = NF | last7 = Hussein | first7 = AA | last8 = Smart | first8 = LM | last9 = Sabatinelli | first9 = D | year = 2014 | title = Emotion regulation: Quantitative meta-analysis of functional activation and deactivation | url = | journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 202–211 | doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficient evidence has correlated emotion regulation to particular patterns of prefrontal activation. These regions include the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]al prefrontal cortex, the ventromedial [[prefrontal cortex]], and the [[dorsolateral]] prefrontal cortex. Two additional brain structures that have been found to contribute are the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex. Each of these structures are involved in various facets of emotion regulation and irregularities in one or more regions and/or interconnections among them are affiliated with failures of emotion regulation. An implication to these findings is that individual differences in prefrontal activation predict the ability to perform various tasks in aspects of emotion regulation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Putnam | first2 = K.M. | last3 = Larson | first3 = C.L. | year = 2000 | title = Dysfunction in the neural circuitry of emotion regulation: A possible prelude to violence | url = | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = | pages = 591–594 | doi=10.1126/science.289.5479.591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological===
People intuitively mimic [[facial expressions]]; it is a fundamental part of healthy functioning. Similarities across cultures in regards to [[nonverbal communication]] has prompted the debate that it is in fact a [[universal language]].&lt;ref name="Elfenbein, H. A. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elfenbein | first1 = H. A. | last2 = Ambady | first2 = N. | year = 2002 | title = On the universality and cultural specificity of emotion recognition: a meta-analysis | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 2| pages = 203–235 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.203 | pmid=11931516}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be argued that emotional regulation plays a key role in the ability to emit the correct responses in social situations. Humans have control over facial expressions both [[conscious mind|consciously]] and [[unconscious mind|unconsciously]]: an intrinsic emotion program is generated as the result of a transaction with the world, which immediately results in an emotional response and usually a facial reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ekman | first1 = P. | last2 = Friesen | first2 = W. V. | last3 = Ancoli | first3 = S. | year = 1980 | title = Facial signs of emotional experience | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 1125–1134 | doi=10.1037/h0077722}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a well documented [[phenomenon]] that emotions have an effect on facial expression, but recent research has provided evidence that the opposite may also be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Izard | first1 = C. E. | year = 1990 | title = Facial expressions and the regulation of emotions | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 487–498 | pmid = 2182826 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.3.487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion would give rise to the belief that a person may not only control his emotion but in fact influence them as well. Emotional regulation focuses on providing the appropriate emotion in the appropriate circumstances. Some theories allude to the thought that each emotion serves a specific purpose in coordinating [[organism]]ic needs with [[Environmental psychology|environmental]] demands (cole 1994). This skill, although apparent throughout all nationalities,&lt;ref name="Elfenbein, H. A. 2002"/&gt; has been shown to vary in successful application at different age groups. In experiments done comparing younger and older adults to the same unpleasant stimuli, older adults were able to regulate their emotional reactions in a way that seemed to avoid negative confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charles | first1 = S. T. | last2 = Carstensen | first2 = L. L. | year = 2008 | title = Unpleasant situations elicit different emotional responses in younger and older adults | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 495–504 | doi = 10.1037/a0013284 | pmc = 2677442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings support the theory that with time people develop a better ability to regulate their emotions. This ability found in adults seems to better allow individuals to react in what would be considered a more appropriate manner in some social situations, permitting them to avoid adverse situations that could be seen as detrimental.

====Expressive regulation (in solitary conditions)====
In solitary conditions, emotional regulation can include a minimization-miniaturization effect, in which common outward expressive patterns are replaced with toned down versions of expression. Unlike other situations, in which physical expression (and its regulation) serve a social purpose (i.e. conforming to [[display rules]] or revealing emotion to outsiders), solitary conditions require no reason for emotions to be outwardly expressed (although intense levels of emotion can bring out noticeable expression anyway). The idea behind this is that as people get older, they learn that the purpose of outward expression (to appeal to other people), is not necessary in situations in which there is no one to appeal to.&lt;ref name="Holodynski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holodynski|first=Manfred|title=The Miniaturization of Expression in the Development of Emotional Self-Regulation|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2004|volume=40|issue=1|pages=16–28|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.1.16|pmid=14700461}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the level of emotional expression can be lower in these solitary situations.

===Stress===
According to Yu. V. Scherbatykh, emotional stress in situations like school examinations can be reduced by engaging in self-regulating activities prior to the task being performed. To study the influence of [[Self-control|self-regulation]] on mental and [[physiological]] processes under exam stress, Shcerbatykh conducted a test with an experimental group of 28 students (of both sexes) and a control group of 102 students (also of both sexes).&lt;ref name=Scherbatykh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shcherbatykh|first=Yu. V.|title=Self-Regulation of Autonomic Homeostasis in Emotional Stress|journal=Human Physiology|year=2000|volume=26|issue=5|pages=641–642|url=http://www.no-stress.ru/stress/stress_science/emotional_stress_regulation.html|doi=10.1007/BF02760382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the moments before the examination, [[situational]] stress levels were raised in both groups from what they were in quiet states. In the experimental group, participants engaged in three self-regulating techniques (concentration on respiration, general body relaxation, and the creation of a mental image of successfully passing the examination). During the examination, the anxiety levels of the experimental group were lower than that of the control group. Also, the percent of unsatisfactory marks in the experimental group was 1.7 times less than in the control group. From this data, Scherbatykh concluded that the application of self-regulating actions before examinations helps to significantly reduce levels of emotional strain, which can help lead to better performance results.&lt;ref name=Scherbatykh /&gt;

===Decision making===
Identification of our emotional self-regulating process can facilitate in the decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Miclea, M. |author2=Miu, A. |pmid=20364902|title=Emotion Regulation and Decision Making Under Risk and Uncertainty|year=2010|volume=10|issue=2|pages=257–65|doi=10.1037/a0018489|journal=Emotion (Washington, D.C.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current literature on emotion regulation identifies that humans characteristically make efforts in controlling emotion experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gross, J. J.|pmid=12212647|url=http://sprweb.org/articles/Gross02.pdf|year=2002|title=Emotion regulation: Affective, cognitive, and social consequences|volume=39|issue=3|pages=281–91|journal=Psychophysiology|doi=10.1017/s0048577201393198}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is then a possibility that our present state emotions can be altered by emotional regulation strategies resulting in the possibility that different regulation strategies could have different decision implications.

==Effects of low self regulation==
With a failure in emotional regulation there is a rise in [[psychosocial]] and emotional dysfunctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bandura, A. |author2=Caprara, G. V. |author3=Barbaranelli, C. |author4=Gerbino, M. |author5=Pastorelli, C. |title=Role of Affective Self-Regulatory Efficacy in Diverse Spheres of Psychosocial Functioning|pmid=12795389 |jstor=3696228|year=2003|volume=74|issue=3|pages=769–82|journal=Child Development|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00567}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused by traumatic experiences due to an inability to regulate emotions. These traumatic experiences typically happen in grade school and are sometimes associated with [[bullying]]. Children who can't properly self-regulate express their volatile emotions in a variety of ways, including screaming if they don't have their way, lashing out with their fists, or bullying other children. Such behaviors often elicit negative reactions from the social environment, which, in turn, can exacerbate or maintain the original regulation problems over time, a process termed cumulative continuity. These children are more likely to have conflict-based relationships with their teachers and other children. This can lead to more severe problems such as an impaired ability to adjust to school and predicts school dropout many years later. Children who fail to properly self-regulate grow as teenagers with more emerging problems. Their peers begin to notice this "immaturity", and these children are often excluded from social groups and teased and harassed by their peers. This "immaturity" certainly causes some teenagers to become social outcasts in their respective social groups, causing them to lash out in angry and potentially violent ways. Being teased or being an outcast during the teenage years is especially damaging and could lead to a dysfunctional future,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} which is why it is recommended to foster emotional self-regulation in children as early as possible.

'''Endogenous regeneration''' in the brain is the ability of cells to engage in the repair and [[Regeneration (biology)#Humans|regeneration]] process.  While the brain has a limited capacity for regeneration, [[Endogeny|endogenous]] neural [[stem cell]]s, as well as numerous pro-regenerative molecules, can participate in replacing and repairing damaged or diseased [[neuron]]s and [[Neuroglia|glial cells]].  Another benefit that can be achieved by using endogenous regeneration could be avoiding an [[Immune system|immune]] response from the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Odelberg S. J. |year=2002 |title=Indus regeneration in mammals|journal= Cell &amp; Developmental Biology |volume=13 |pages=335–343. |doi=10.1016/s1084-9521(02)00089-7 |pmid= 12324215 |issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neural stem cells in the adult brain==
During the early development of a human, [[Nervous system|neural]] stem cells lie in the [[Germ layer|germinal layer]] of the developing brain, [[Ventricular system|ventricular]] and [[subventricular zone]]s.  In brain development, [[Multipotent#Multipotency|multipotent]] stem cells (those that can generate different types of cells) are present in these regions, and all of these cells differentiate into neural cell forms, such as [[neurons]], [[oligodendrocytes]] and [[astrocytes]].  A long-held belief states that the multipotency of neural stem cells would be lost in the adult human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Doetsch F, Isabelle C, Lim DA |year=1999 |title=Subventricular Zone Astrocytes Are Neural Stem Cells in the Adult Mammalian Brain |journal=Cell |volume=97 |pages=703–716|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80783-7|pmid=10380923|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is only ''[[in vitro]]'', using [[neurosphere]] and adherent [[monolayer]] cultures, stem cells that can be found in the adult mammalian brain that have shown mutipotent capacity, while the ''[[in vivo]]'' study is not convincing.  Therefore, the term "neural progenitor" is used instead of "stem cell" to describe limited regeneration ability in the adult brain stem cell.&lt;ref name='zhao'&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhao, C. |author2=Deng, W. |author3=Gage, F. H. |year=2008 |title=Mechanisms and functional implications of adult neurogenesis |journal= Cell |volume=132 |pages=645–660 |doi= 10.1016/j.cell.2008.01.033 |pmid=18295581|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neural stem cells]] (NSC) reside in the [[subventricular zone]] (SVZ) of the adult human brain and the [[dentate gyrus]] of the adult mammalian [[hippocampus]].  Newly formed neurons from these regions participate in learning, memory, [[olfaction]] and mood modulation.&lt;ref name='zhao' /&gt;  It has not been definitively determined whether or not these stem cells are multipotents.  NSC from the hippocampus of rodents, which can differentiate into dentate [[granule cell]]s, have developed into many cell types when studied in culture.&lt;ref name='ming'&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Guo-li Ming H. S. |year=2005 |title=Adult Neurogenesis in the Mammalian Central Nervous System |journal=Annu. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=28|pages=223–250. |doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.28.051804.101459 |pmid=16022595}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another ''in vivo'' study, using NSCs in the postnatal SVZ, showed that the stem cell is restricted to developing into different neuronal sub-type cells in the [[olfactory bulb]].  It is believed that the various spatial location niches regulate the differentiation of the neural stem cell.&lt;ref name='development'&gt;{{cite journal| author=Duan, X. |author2=Kang, E. |author3=Liu, C. Y. |author4=Ming, G. L. |author5=Song, H. |year=2008|title= Development of neural stem cell in the adult brain |journal= Curr Opin Neurobiol |volume=18 | issue = 1 |pages=108–115 |doi= 10.1016/j.conb.2008.04.001|pmc=2464621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurogenesis in the central nervous system==
{{main|neuroregeneration}}

[[Santiago Ramon y Cajal]], a neuroscience pioneer, concluded that the generation of neurons occurs only in the [[Prenatal development|prenatal]] phase of human development, not after birth.  This theory had long been the fundamental principle of [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref name='ming' /&gt;  However, in the mid-20th century, evidence of adult mammalian [[neurogenesis]] was found in rodent hippocampus and other region of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Altman J. |title=Autoradiographic and histological studies of postnatal neurogenesis. II. A longitudinal investigation of the kinetics, migration and transformation of cells incorporating tritiated thymidine in infant rats, with special reference to postnatal neurogenesis in some brain regions | year=1966 |journal=J. Comp. Neurol. |pages=431–74 |doi=10.1002/cne.901280404 |volume=128 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the intact adult mammalian brain, [[neuroregeneration]] maintains the function and structure of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS).  The most adult stem cells in the brain are found in the subventricular zone at the lateral walls of the lateral ventricle.  Another region where neurogenesis takes place in the adult brain is the [[subgranular zone]] (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus.  While the exact mechanism that maintains functional NSCs in these regions is still unknown, NSCs have shown an ability to restore neurons and glia in response to certain [[Pathology|pathological]] conditions.  However, so far, this regeneration by NSCs is insufficient to restore the full function and structure of an injured brain.  However, endogenous neuroregeneration, unlike using embryonic stem cell implantation, is anticipated to treat damaged CNS without immunogenesis or [[Carcinogenesis|tumorigenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ninette Amariglio A. H. |author2=Bernd W, Scheithauer |author3=Yoram Cohen |year=2009 |title=Donor-Derived Brain Tumor Following Neural Stem Cell Transplantation in an Ataxia Telangiectasia Patient|journal= PLOS Medicine |volume=6 | issue = 2 |pages= 221–231 |url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000029 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurogenesis in subgranular zone==
[[Progenitor cells]] in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus migrate to the nearby location and differentiate into granule cells. As a part of the [[limbic system]], new neurons of the hippocampus maintain the function of controlling mood, learning and memory.  In the dentate gyrus, [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/putative putative] stem cells, called type 1 cells, proliferate into type 2 and type 3 cells, which are transiently amplifying, lineage-determined progenitor cells.  Type 1 cells in the hippocampus are multipotent ''in vitro''.  However, although there is evidence that both new neurons and glia are generated in the hippocampus ''in vivo'', no exact relationship of neurogenesis to type 1 cells is shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gerd Kempermann |author2=Sebastian Jessberger |author3=Barbara Steiner |author4=Golo Kronenberg |title=Milestones of neuronal development in the adult hippocampus |journal = Trends in Neurosciences |volume = 27 | issue = 8 | year = 2004|doi=10.1016/j.tins.2004.05.013|url=http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences//retrieve/pii/S0166223604001675_returnURL=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166223604001675?showall=true |pages=447–452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hippocampus, newly formed neurons contribute only a small portion to the entire neuron population.  These new neurons have different [[electrophysiology]] compared to the rest of the existing neurons.  This may be evidence that generating new neurons in the SGZ is part of learning and memorizing activity of mammals.  Several studies have been performed to explain the relationship between neruogenesis and learning.  In the case of learning, that related to the hippocampal function, a significantly increased number of neurons are generated in the SGZ and survival of the new neurons is increased if they are required for retention of memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bendetta Leuner |author2=Sabrina Mendolia-Loffredo |author3=Yevgenia Kozorovitskiy |author4=Deanna Samburg |author5=Elizabeth Gould |author6=Tracey J. Shors |title = Learning Enhances the Survival of New Neurons beyond the Time when the Hippocampus Is Required for Memory |year =2004 |journal = The Journal of Neuroscience |volume =24 | issue = 34 |pages = 7477–7481|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/34/7477.full.pdf |doi=10.1523/jneurosci.0204-04.2004 |pmid=15329394 |pmc=3279157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Elizabeth Gould |author2=Anna Beylin |author3=Patima Tanapat |author4=Alison Reeves |author5=Tracey J. Shors |title = Learning enhances adult neurogenesis in the Hippocampal formation  |year = 1999 |journal= Nature  |volume= 2 |pages= 260–265|url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v2/n3/full/nn0399_260.html |issue=3 |doi=10.1038/6365 |pmid=10195219}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to learning and memorizing, neurogenesis in the SGZ is also affected by mood and emotion.  With constant, inescapable stress, which usually results in emotional depression, there is a significant decrease in neurogensis, the effect of which can be reversed by treatment with [[fluoxetine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Fluoxetine Treatment | year = 2003 |journal = Neuropsychopharmacology |volume = 28 |pages = 1562–1571 |doi=10.1038/sj.npp.1300234 |issue=9 |title = Cell Proliferation in Adult Hippocampus is Decreased by Inescapable Stress: Reversal by Fluoxetine Treatment |pmid = 12838272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurogenesis in subventricular zone==
The largest NSC population in the brain is found in the SVZ.  The SVZ is considered a micro-environment called a "stem cell niche" that retains the NSC's capacity of self-renewing and multipotency.  Basic [[fibroblast]] growth factor (FGF2), [[hepatocyte growth factor]] (HGF), [[Notch-1]], [[sonic hedgehog]] (SHH), [[Noggin (protein)|noggin]], [[ciliary neurotrophic factor]] (CNTF), and a soluble carbohydrate-binding protein, [[Galectin-1]], are reported as factors that maintain such properties of NSC in stem cell niche.  Like stem cells in SGZ, progenitor cells in SVZ also differentiate into neurons and form an intermediate cell called a transiently amplifying cell (TAC).  A recent study revealed that [[beta-catenin]] signaling, Wnt β-catenin, regulates the differentiation of TAC.&lt;ref name='gene'&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Naoko Kaneko |author2=Eisuke Kako |author3=Kazunobu Sawamoto |title=Prospects and Limitations of Using Endogenous Neural Stem Cells for Brain Regeneration |year =2011 |journal = Genes |volume = 2 |pages = 107–130 |doi = 10.3390/genes2010107 | issue =4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NSCs in the SVZ have a distinct capacity to migrate into the olfactory bulb in the anterior tip of the [[Cerebrum|telencephalon]]
by a pathway called the [[rostral migratory stream]] (RMS).  This migration is unique to new neurons in the SVZ that embryonic neurogenesis and nerogenesis at other region of the brain are not able to perform.  Another unique neurogensis in the SVZ is neurogenesis by astrocytes.  A study done by Doetsch (1999) showed that astrocytes in the SVZ can be dedifferentiate and differentiate into neurons in the olfactory bulb.  Among four types of cells in the SVZ (migrating neuroblasts, immature precursors, astrocytes, and [[ependyma]]l cells), migrating neuroblasts and immature precursors are silenced with the anti-[[Mitosis|mitotic]] agent and astrocytes are infected with a [[retrovirus]].  In the result, neurons that have the retrovirus are found in the olfactory bulb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Doetsch, F. |author2=Isabelle, C. |author3=Lim, D. A. |title=Subventricular Zone Astrocytes Are Neural Stem Cells in the Adult Mammalian Brain |year=1999 |journal = Cell |pages= 703–716 |volume=97 |doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80783-7 |pmid = 10380923 |issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors affecting neurogenesis==
Neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain is affected by various factors, including exercise, [[stroke]], brain [[Insult (medical)|insult]] and pharmacological treatments.  For example, [[kainic acid]]-induced seizures, antidepressant ([[fluoxetine]]), [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[GABA]] and growth factors ([[fibroblast growth factors]] (FGFs), [[epidermal growth factor]] (EGF), [[neuregulins]] (NRGs), [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF), and [[pigment epithelium-derived factor]] (PEDF) induce formation of neuroblasts.  The final destination of NSCs is determined by "niche" signals.  [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt]] signaling drives NSCs to the formation of new neurons in the SGZ, whereas bone [[Morphogenesis|morphogenic]] proteins (BMPs) promote NSC differentiation into glia cells in the SVZ.&lt;ref name='development' /&gt;

However, in the case of brain injury, neurogenesis seems insufficient to repair damaged neurons.  Thus, Cajal's theory was accepted for a long time.  In actuality, in the intercranial physiological condition, many neurogenesis inhibitors are present (for example, [[axon]] growth-inhibitory [[ligand]]s expressed in [[oligodendrocytes]], [[myelin]], NG2-glia, and reactive astrocytes in the lesion and degenerating tracts, and fibroblasts in scar tissue).  The inhibitory ligands bind to [[growth cone]] receptors on a damaged neuron, which causes repulsion and collapse of the growth cone in the damaged regions.  Among inhibitory factors, oligodendrocyte and myelin-derived inhibitory ligands are membrane-bound, meaning that, in the case of injury, those factors are not upregulated or overexpressed, rather it is from direct contact between intact or degraded myelin (or oligodendrocytes) and newly forming neurons.

Nevertheless, with scar formation, many cell types in the brain release growth-inhibitory ligands such as [[basal lamina]] components, inhibitory axon guidance molecules and [[chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=AXEL SANDVIG |author2=MARTIN BERRY |author3=LEE B. BARRETT |author4=ARTHUR BUTT |author5=AND ANN LOGAN |title=Myelin-, Reactive Glia-, and Scar-Derived CNS Axon Growth Inhibitors:Expression, Receptor Signaling, and Correlation with Axon Regeneration |journal =GLIA |year=2004 |volume =46 |pages=225–251 | doi= 10.1002/glia.10315 | pmid= 15048847 | issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Inhibitory action of such factors may be a protection of the brain from inflammation.  Okano and Sawamoto used an astrocyte-selective conditional [[Stat3]]-deficient mice model to examine the role of reactive astrocytes.  The result was increased widespread [[CD11b]]-positive inflammatory cell invasion and [[Demyelinating disease|demyelination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hideyuki Okano |author2=Kazunobu Sawamoto |title=Neural stem cells: involvement in adult neurogenesis and CNS repair |year=2012 |journal = Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B |volume=363 |pages=2111–2122 |doi =10.1098/rstb.2008.2264 | issue =1500 | pmid =18339601 | pmc =2610183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Brain damage itself can induce endogenous regeneration.  Many studies have proven endogenous regeneration as a possible treatment of brain damage.  However, the inhibitory reaction of the surrounding tissue of damaged region must be overcome before the treatment produces significant improvement.

===Traumatic brain injury===
In the study of the endogenous regeneration of the brain done by Scharff and co-researchers, damaged neurons in a songbird brain are regenerated with the same neuronal types where regeneration occurs (in the case of the study, the hippocampus).  However, in places where normal regeneration of the neuron does not occur, there was no replacement of damaged neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Scharff C, Kirn JR, Grossman M, Macklis JD, Nottebohm F |title =Targeted neuronal death affects neuronal replacement and vocal behavior in adult songbirds |journal=Neuron |year =2002|pages =481–492 |volume=25 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80910-1 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, recovering brain function after a brain injury was supposed to have limitations.  However, a current study revealed that neurons are repaired to some degree after damage, from the SVZ.

The migrating ability of progenitor cells in the SVZ form chain-like structures and laterally move progenitor cells towards the injured region. Along with progenitor cells, thin astrocytic processes and blood vessels also play an important role in the migration of neuroblasts, suggesting that the blood vessels may act as a scaffold.  Other factors that contribute of the migration are [[Slit (gene family)|slit proteins]] (produced at the [[choroid plexus]]) and their gradient (generated by the flow of [[cerebrospinal fluid]]).  However, only 0.2% of new neurons survived and functioned in this study.  Enhancing neurogenesis can be done by injecting growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF).  However, enhanced neurogenesis also have the possibility of [[epilepsy]] resulting in prolonged seizures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Okano H, Sakaguchi M, Ohki K, Suzuki N, Sawamoto K |title=Regeneration of the central nervous system using endogenous repair mechanisms |year=2007 |journal =J Neurochem |pages=1459–1465 |volume=102 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.04674.x |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parkinson's Disease===
Although endogenous regeneration methods are showing some promising evidence in treating [[brain ischemia]], the current body of knowledge regarding promoting and inhibiting endogenous regeneration is not sufficient to treat [[Parkinson's disease]].  Both extrinsic and intrinsic modulation of pathological and physiological stimulation prevent the progenitor cell from differentiating into [[dopamine]] cells.  Further research must be done to understand factors that affect progenitor cell differentiation in order to treat Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Andreas Hermann |author2=Alexander Storch |title=Endogenous Regeneration in Parkinson's Disease: Do We Need Orthotopic Dopaminergic Neurogenesis? |year=2008 |journal=Stem Cells |volume=26 |pages=2749–2752 |doi=10.1634/stemcells.2008-0567 |issue=11 |pmid=18719222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the difficulties in replacing compromised dopamine neurons through endogenous sources, recent work suggests that pharmacological activation of endogenous [[neural stem cell]]s or neural precursor cells results in powerful neuronal rescue and motor skill improvements through a signal [[Transduction (biophysics)|transduction]] pathway that involves the [[phosphorylation]] of [[STAT3]] on the [[serine]] residue and subsequent Hes3 expression increase ([[Hes3 signaling axis|STAT3-Ser/Hes3 Signaling Axis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Androutsellis-Theotokis A, Rueger MA, Park DM |title=Targeting neural precursors in the adult brain rescues injured dopamine neurons |journal=Proc.

'''Framingham State University''' is a [[public university]] in [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]], [[Massachusetts]].  It offers [[undergraduate]] programs in a range of subjects, including art, biology, and communication arts, and [[Graduate school|graduate]] programs, including [[MBA]], [[MEd]], and [[Master's degree|MS]].

==History==
[[File:Cyrus Peirce 1790-1860.jpg|thumb|[[Cyrus Peirce]], first president]]
As the first secretary of the newly created Board of Education in [[Massachusetts]], [[Horace Mann]] instituted school reforms that included the creation of an experimental [[normal school]], the first one in the [[United States]], in [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], in July 1839. [[Cyrus Peirce]] was its first principal or president.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.framingham.edu/henry-whittemore-library/curriculum-library-archives-and-special-collections/150-years-in-framingham/our-history.html Framingham State College – 150 Years in Framingham&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620132902/http://www.framingham.edu/henry-whittemore-library/curriculum-library-archives-and-special-collections/150-years-in-framingham/our-history.html |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second normal school was opened in September 1839 in West Barre (the school later moved to Westfield) followed by [[Bridgewater State College]] the next year. Growth forced the first normal school's relocation to [[West Newton, Massachusetts|West Newton]] in 1843, followed in 1853 by a move to the present site on Bare Hill in Framingham.

In 1922, the Framingham Normal School granted its first [[Bachelor of Science]] in Education degrees in conjunction with a four-year study program. Ten years later, with degreed teachers becoming the norm, the normal schools were renamed State Teachers Colleges.  The name was changed in 1960 to the State College at Framingham when [[Bachelor of Arts]] degrees were added. At present, [[Master's degree|Masters']] of Education, Arts, and Science degrees are granted as well. In 2007, the college began offering the Master's of Business Administration (MBA) degree. In October 2010, seven of the state colleges became state universities, unaffiliated with the [[University of Massachusetts]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/legis/186history/h04864.htm Bill Details – H4864&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The measure was signed into law by Massachusetts Governor [[Deval Patrick]] on July 28, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.fsc.edu/fscnews/index.cfm?detail=818 Public Relations – News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salemstate.edu/about/10414.php Salem State University: University Designation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002323/http://www.salemstate.edu/about/10414.php |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French '''Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission''' or '''CEA''' ([[French language|French]]: [[:fr:Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives|Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives]]), is a [[France|French]] public government-funded research organisation in the areas of energy, defense and security, information technologies and health technologies. The CEA maintains a cross-disciplinary culture of engineers and researchers, building on the synergies between fundamental and technological research.

CEA is headed by a board headed by the general administrator (currently François Jacq since April 20, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cea.fr/presse/Pages/actualites-communiques/institutionnel/nomination-francois-jacq-administrateur-general-cea.aspx|title=François Jacq est nommé Administrateur général du CEA}}&lt;/ref&gt;), advised by the high-commissioner for atomic energy (currently [[Yves Bréchet]]). The missions of the CEA are equivalent to those of the [[United States Department of Energy]]. Its yearly budget amounts to 4.7 billion euros and its permanent staff is slightly under 16,000 persons.&lt;ref name=CEA-website/&gt; It owns [[Areva]].

CEA was created in 1945; since then, the successive high-commissioners have been [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]], [[Francis Perrin]], [[Jacques Yvon]], [[Jean Teillac]], [[Raoul Dautry]], [[René Pellat]], [[Bernard Bigot]], and [[Daniel Verwaerde]].

It conducts fundamental and applied research into many areas, including the design of [[nuclear reactor]]s, the manufacturing of [[integrated circuits]], the use of [[radionucleide]]s for curing illnesses, [[seismology]] and [[tsunami]] propagation, the safety of [[computer|computerized systems]], etc.

The '''Ghent-Bruges School''' is a manner or movement of [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]] from about 1475 to about 1550 that developed in southern Netherlands, now Belgium. The term was first used in 1891 by Joseph Destree, author of ''Recherches sur les elumineurs flamands'' and art historian [[Paul Durrieu]].&lt;ref name="Turner p. 118"&gt;Jane Turner. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6BIXXNwEOv8C&amp;pg=PA118 The Grove Dictionary of Art: From renaissance to impressionism : styles and movements in western art 1400-1900]''. St. Martin's Press; 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-312-22975-7}}. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

It replaced the "courtly style" of about 1440 to 1474 during the southern Netherlands reigns of [[Philip the Good]] and [[Charles the Bold]]. That mid-15th-century style consisted of works in primary colors of "wooden, clumsily painted stock figures".&lt;ref name="Turner p. 118" /&gt; 

The Ghent-Bruges School style created illuminated manuscripts with realistic images of people, including half- and full-length portraits, colorful landscapes and the use of bright and pastel colors.&lt;ref name="Turner p. 118" /&gt;

'''Global Engineering Education''' is a field of study that focuses on the impact of [[globalization]] on the [[engineering industry]].

== History ==
Over the past decade or so educators and researchers have made an effort to transform engineering education in light of global trends in the profession.  In 1985, the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] issued a study that spotlighted the need for universities to graduate engineers with professional skills.&lt;ref&gt;Engineering Education and Practice in the United States: Foundations of our Techno-Economic Future. 1985, National Research Council: Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; This message was reinforced through a 1994 joint report published by the Engineering Deans Council and [[ASEE]]&lt;ref&gt;Dowell, E., E. Baum, and J. McTague, Green Report: Engineering Education for a Changing World. American Soc. for Engineering Education, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; that stated, “Today, engineering colleges … must educate their students to work as part of teams, communicate well, and understand the economic, social, environmental and international context of their professional activities.”

== Definitions ==

===Global Competency===
[[Global competency]] is essential for engineers from any country who now compete in an international market for engineering know-how.  No longer is [[cultural sensitivity]] needed only for [[product design]] destined for diverse markets. Increasingly, successful entry into the engineering profession requires significant intercultural skills in order to join efficient and productive collaborations with diverse engineering colleagues. Those colleagues may be encountered “virtually” at a distance, in person at an international site, or next door in the office of a [[multinational corporation]]. Outsourcing is increasing, not only for products but also for processes, including highly technical engineering work. Projects are distributed across sites and effective collaboration requires professionals who can work productively with colleagues who are very different from themselves.&lt;ref&gt;B. I. Allert, D. L. Atkinson, E. A. Groll, E. D. Hirleman, [http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=ojgee Making the Case for Global Engineering: Building Foreign Language Collaborations for Designing, Implementing, and Assessing Programs]. Online Journal for Global Engineering Education, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resources ==
[[IEEE Education Society]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/edsoc/ The Education Society]&lt;/ref&gt; belongs to the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and its major objective is to strive a global leader in engineering education. The organization of education engineering worldwide conferences as they are the EDUCON and the FIE - Frontiers in Education Conference with an open view of all the publications included there as well the integration of engineering educator leaders along all the world in the Administration Committee allows a world integration of different views and perspectives. Newly publication IEEE-RITA (Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologías del Aprendizaje - Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologías de Aprendizagem - Latin-American Learning Technologies Journal) incorporates a new vision of technology and engineering education in Spanish and Portuguese languages.&lt;ref&gt;R.

The '''Israel Association for Automatic Control''' (IAAC) is a national member organization of the [[International Federation of Automatic Control]] (IFAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifac-control.org/about/structure/nmolist?id=IL |title=List of National Member Organisations - ISRAEL |publisher=[[International Federation of Automatic Control]] |accessdate={{Format date|2013|2|23}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; IAAC was one of the first member organizations of IFAC, and was founded in the early sixties by [[control system]] researchers from the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]], and from [[Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd.]]

The mission of IAAC is the advancement of science, applications, and education in the area of automatic control, with an emphasis of the needs of [[Israel]]. To meet this goal, IAAC pro-actively organizes conferences, lectures, courses, and workshops; promotes information exchange between the various organizations involved in automatic control; promotes co-operations between organizations involved in automatic control in Israel and abroad.

The '''Donald E. Knuth Prize''' is a prize for outstanding contributions to the foundations of [[computer science]], named after [[Donald Knuth|Donald E. Knuth]].

==History==
The Knuth Prize has been awarded since 1996 and includes an award of $5000. The prize is awarded by [[ACM SIGACT]] and by [[IEEE Computer Society]]'s Technical Committee on the Mathematical Foundations of Computing. Prizes are awarded in alternation at the ACM [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]] and at the IEEE [[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]], which are among the most prestigious conferences in [[theoretical computer science]].

In contrast with the [[Gödel Prize]], which recognizes outstanding papers, the Knuth Prize is awarded to individuals for their overall impact in the field.

==Winners==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10087">In [[computability theory]], an '''[[undecidable problem]]''' is a type of [[computational problem]] that requires a yes/no answer, but where there cannot possibly be any computer program that always gives the correct answer; that is, any possible program would sometimes give the wrong answer or run forever without giving any answer. More formally, an undecidable problem is a problem whose language is not a [[recursive set]]; see the article [[Decidable language]].  There are [[uncountable set|uncountably]] many undecidable problems, so the list below is necessarily incomplete. Though undecidable languages are not recursive languages, they may be [[subset]]s of [[Alan Turing|Turing]] recognizable languages: i.e., such undecidable languages may be recursively enumerable.

Many, if not most, undecidable problems in mathematics can be posed as [[word problem (mathematics)|word problems]]: determining when two distinct strings of symbols (encoding some mathematical concept or object) represent the same object or not.

For undecidability in axiomatic mathematics, see [[List of statements undecidable in ZFC]].

==Problems in [[logic]]==
* Hilbert's [[Entscheidungsproblem]].
* [[Type inference]] and [[type checking]] for the second-order [[lambda calculus]] (or equivalent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = J. B. | last = Wells | title = Typability and type checking in the second-order lambda-calculus are equivalent and undecidable | citeseerx = 10.1.1.31.3590 | journal = Tech. Rep. 93-011 | publisher = Comput. Sci. Dept., Boston Univ. | year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Determining whether a first-order sentence in the [[logic of graphs]] can be realized by a finite undirected graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Trahtenbrot | first = B. A. | authorlink = Boris Trakhtenbrot | journal = Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR (N.S.) | mr = 0033784 | pages = 569–572 | title = The impossibility of an algorithm for the decision problem for finite domains | volume = 70 | year = 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Trakhtenbrot's theorem]] - Finite satisfiability is undecidable.
* Satisfiability of first order [[Horn clause]]s

==Problems about [[abstract machine]]s==

* The [[halting problem]] (determining whether a [[Turing machine]] halts on a given input) and the [[mortality (computability theory)|mortality problem]] (determining whether it halts for every starting configuration).
* Determining whether a Turing machine is a [[Busy beaver#Non-computability of Σ|busy beaver champion]] (i.e., is the longest-running among halting Turing machines with the same number of states).
* [[Rice's theorem]] states that for all nontrivial properties of partial functions, it is undecidable whether a given machine computes a partial function with that property.
* The halting problem for a [[Minsky machine]]: a finite-state automaton with no inputs and two counters that can be incremented, decremented, and tested for zero.
* Universality of a Nondeterministic [[Pushdown automaton]]: determining whether all words are accepted.

==Problems about [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]==

* The [[mortal matrix problem]]: determining, given a finite set of ''n'' × ''n'' matrices with integer entries, whether they can be multiplied in some order, possibly with repetition, to yield the [[zero matrix]]. This is known to be undecidable for a set of six or more 3 × 3 matrices, or a set of two 15 × 15 matrices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1404.0644|last1=Cassaigne|first1=Julien|title=Tighter Undecidability Bounds for Matrix Mortality, Zero-in-the-Corner Problems, and More|last2=Halava|first2=Vesa|last3=Harju|first3=Tero|last4=Nicolas|first4=Francois|class=cs.DM|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Determining whether a finite set of upper triangular 3 × 3 matrices with nonnegative integer entries generates a free [[semigroup]].
* Determining whether two finitely generated subsemigroups of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''Z''') have a common element.

==Problems in [[combinatorial group theory]]==

* The [[word problem for groups]].
* The [[conjugacy problem]].
* The [[group isomorphism problem]].

==Problems in [[topology]]==

* Determining whether two finite [[simplicial complex]]es are [[homeomorphic]].
* Determining whether a finite [[simplicial complex]] is (homeomorphic to) a [[manifold]].
* Determining whether the [[fundamental group]] of a finite simplicial complex is trivial.

==Problems in analysis==
* For functions in certain classes, the problem of determining: whether two functions are equal, known as the zero-equivalence problem (see [[Richardson's theorem]]);&lt;ref&gt;Keith O. Geddes, Stephen R. Czapor, George Labahn, ''Algorithms for Computer Algebra'', {{isbn|0585332479}}, 2007, p. 81ff&lt;/ref&gt; the zeroes of a function; whether the indefinite integral of a function is also in the class.&lt;ref name="stall"/&gt; Of course, some subclasses of these problems are decidable. For example, there is an effective decision procedure for the elementary integration of any function which belongs to a field of transcendental elementary functions, the [[Risch algorithm]].) 
* "The problem of deciding whether the definite contour multiple integral of an elementary meromorphic function is zero over an everywhere real analytic manifold on which it is analytic", a consequence of the [[Matiyasevich's theorem|MRDP theorem]] resolving [[Hilbert's tenth problem]].&lt;ref name="stall"&gt;Stallworth, Daniel T. and Fred W. Roush [http://www.ams.org/proc/1997-125-07/S0002-9939-97-03822-7/S0002-9939-97-03822-7.pdf An Undecidable Property of Definite Integrals] ''Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society'' Volume 125, Number 7, July 1997, Pages 2147-2148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other problems==
* The [[Post correspondence problem]].
* The problem of determining if a given set of [[Wang tile]]s can tile the plane.
* The problem whether a [[tag system]] halts.
* The problem of determining the [[Kolmogorov complexity]] of a string.
* [[Hilbert's tenth problem]]: the problem of deciding whether a Diophantine equation (multivariable polynomial equation) has a solution in integers.
* Determining if a [[context-free grammar]] generates all possible strings, or if it is ambiguous.
* Given two context-free grammars, determining whether they generate the same set of strings, or whether one generates a subset of the strings generated by the other, or whether there is any string at all that both generate.
* Determining whether a given initial point with rational coordinates is periodic, or whether it lies in the basin of attraction of a given open set, in a piecewise-linear iterated map in two dimensions, or in a piecewise-linear flow in three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Unpredictability and undecidability in dynamical systems|url=http://www.seas.gwu.edu/~simhaweb/iisc/Moore.pdf|first=Cristopher|last=Moore|authorlink=Cristopher Moore|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=64|issue=20|year=1990|pages=2354–2357|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.64.2354|pmid=10041691|bibcode=1990PhRvL..64.2354M}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maritime Archaeology Trust''' (formerly the '''Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology''') is a [[charitable trust]] that researches and excavates maritime archaeology and heritage in [[Great Britain]]. Historically, their core activities were focused around [[Hampshire]], the [[Isle of Wight]] and the [[Solent]], but now they work in other parts of the country and on international projects.

==History==
The discovery of the wreck of [[HMS Pomone (1805)|HMS ''Pomone'']] at [[The Needles]] in 1969 led the [[Isle of Wight Council]] to fund and organise a team to research and excavate the site.&lt;ref name=M52&gt;Medland, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; As more wrecks were discovered in the following decades, the '''Isle of Wight Maritime Heritage Project''' was formed. The project originally focused on the [[Yarmouth Roads Wreck|Yarmouth Roads Protected Wreck Site]] but also began to identify [[Mesolithic]] sites on the seabed of the [[Solent]].&lt;ref name=Sparks3&gt;Sparks, Momber &amp; Satchell, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BA32&gt;British Archaeology, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;  When central government funds were withdrawn, the project was re-organised as the '''Isle of Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology''' in 1990. The Trust managed the excavation of several sites and became the [[licensee]] for many of them.&lt;ref name=M52/&gt;  In 1991, with support from [[Hampshire County Council]], the Trust's scope expanded and it became the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology.&lt;ref name=Sparks3/&gt;&lt;ref name=BA32/&gt; In 2013, it became the Maritime Archaeology Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimearchaeologytrust.org/mat|title=HWTMA is MAT|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
The charity has since investigated a great deal of maritime archaeology around the Solent, including shipwrecks, submerged landscapes and inter-tidal foreshore sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimearchaeologytrust.org/research|title=Archaeological Research|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also conducted projects as far away as [[Gibraltar]] and the [[Farasan Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimearchaeologytrust.org/sublocation|title=Submerged prehistory|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bouldnor Cliff===
In 1999 divers from the Trust discovered the Mesolithic settlement site of [[Bouldnor Cliff]]. The site is offshore of [[Bouldnor]] on the Isle of Wight and about 11 metres below the surface of the Solent.&lt;ref&gt;British Archaeology, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Attention was first drawn to the site when divers observed a lobster discarding worked flint tools from its burrow.&lt;ref name=BA32/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCAtlantis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/6928293.stm|title=Fight on to save Stone Age Atlantis|publisher=BBC|date=8 August 2007 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, regular fieldwork has revealed that Bouldnor was almost certainly a settlement site approximately 8,000 years ago (6,000 BC), at a time when lower sea levels meant that the Solent was an extensive river valley. Work done so far has revealed that the technology of Mesolithic settlers was probably 2,000 years ahead of what had previously been believed.&lt;ref name=BBCAtlantis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Diving into the Past| newspaper =Isle of Wight County Press | pages =14 | date=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forton Lake===
Between 2006 and 2009, the Trust ran a joint community archaeology project at [[Forton Lake]], with the [[Nautical Archaeology Society]], cataloguing the wide range of [[hulk (medieval ship type)|hulk]]s there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nauticalarchaeologysociety.org/projects/forton.php|title=Forton Lake|publisher=Nautical Archaeology Society|date=|accessdate=31 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425123831/http://www.nauticalarchaeologysociety.org/projects/forton.php|archivedate=25 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was designed to raise local awareness and foster a sense of local pride and ownership amongst nearby residents in [[Gosport]].&lt;ref&gt;Forton Lake, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centaur Tanks===
In a joint project with [[Southsea Sub Aqua Club]], the Trust has investigated two [[Centaur tank]]s from a capsized [[Landing Craft Tank]] in the Solent, as part of a case study to see if land based legislation can be used to protect maritime archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isle of Wight's sunken World War II tanks studied |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-14322864 |publisher=BBC |date= 28 July 2011 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Mystery Wreck===
The Trust investigated a 'mystery wreck' on [[Horse Tail Sands]] in the Solent between 2003 and 2011. It was not until 2011 that the Trust was able to confirm the vessel's identity as the ''Flower of Ugie'', a 19th-century [[barque]]. As well as fully recording the vessel's remains, the Trust replicated the process of wreck research and identification in a teaching pack for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.solentforum.org/resources/pdf/solnews/S%20News%20issue%2030%20web.pdf|title=Mystery Shipwreck Solved|publisher=Solent Forum|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissemination and education==
The Trust runs an active outreach and schools programme and operates a "Maritime Bus" to make maritime archaeology more accessible to the general public. The bus attends regular events in the south coast, including school, community and other public events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schools.hwtma.org.uk/maritimebus|title= The Maritime Bus|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamblevalley.com/home/great-outdoors/heritage.php|title=Hamble Valley; History and Heritage|publisher=The Marketing Collective|accessdate=31 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218165816/http://www.hamblevalley.com/home/great-outdoors/heritage.php|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust also runs the [[Sunken Secrets]] exhibition at [[Fort Victoria (Isle of Wight)|Fort Victoria]] on the Isle of Wight.&lt;ref&gt;Burdett &amp; Insole, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Trust was awarded a [[Europa Nostra]] award for [[Europa Nostra#Categories|Category 4: Education, Training and Awareness Raising]], for "raising the profile of maritime heritage and archaeology", recognising the numerous ways in which the Trust teaches audiences of all types about maritime heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.europanostra.org/projects/64/|title=Raising Awareness of Maritime Cultural Heritage - Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology|publisher=Europa Nostra|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maritime Archaeology Limited==
In 2004, the Trust formed '''Maritime Archaeology Ltd''' as a commercial trading arm in order to provide archaeological contractual services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimearchaeology.co.uk/about-maritime-archaeology/|title=About Maritime Archaeology Ltd.|publisher=Maritime Archaeology Limited|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5521">[[Karl Marx]] wrote a number of notebooks on the [[history of technology]] which so far remain unpublished. Their whereabouts&lt;ref&gt;Amy E. Wendling [2009] Karl Marx on Technology &amp; Alienation. Palgrave Macmillan &lt;/ref&gt; were for a long time unknown but in the past they were read and discussed by [[Marxist]] researchers. 

==History==
[[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] lists Marx's collection of material on technology as one of Marx's "specialisms" in correspondence outlining their mutual division of intellectual labour.&lt;ref name=MarxEngels&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Marx | first1 =Karl | last2 = Engels | first2 = Friedrich | author-link1 = Karl Marx | author-link2 = Friedrich Engels | title = Letters on 'Capital | publisher = New Park | year = 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Marx directly refers to the notebooks in his letter to Engels of January 28, 1863 where he says &lt;blockquote&gt;… I have re-read my notebooks (extracts) on technology, and am attending a practical (only experimental) course for workers on the same by Professor Willis (in Jermyn Street, the Institute for Geology, where Huxley also gave his lectures)… While re-reading the technological-historical excerpts, I came to the conclusion that , apart from the invention of gun-powder, the compass and printing - these necessary pre-requisites for bourgeois development - from the 16th to the mid-18th centuries, i.e. the period of the development of manufacture from craftsmanship until really large-scale industry, the two material foundations on which were based the preparations for mechanised industry within manufacturing were the ''clock'' and the mill … &lt;ref name=MarxEngels /&gt;{{rp|82-84}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Across his writing Marx makes frequent reference to his interest in technological developments, and these mentions are complemented by generic statements such as the need for a critical history of technology in the major footnote at the beginning of the chapter on "Machinery and Large Scale Industry" in ''[[Capital, Volume I]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Marx | first =Karl | author-link = Karl Marx | contribution = Machinery and Large Scale Industry | editor-last = Marx | editor-first = Karl | editor-link = Karl Marx | title = Capital | page = 493–494 | publisher = Penguin | location = London | year = 1971 | title-link =Capital, Volume I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

“A critical history of technology would show how little any of the inventions of the 18th century are the work of a single individual. Hitherto there is no such book. Darwin has interested us in the history of Nature's Technology, i.e., in the formation of the organs of plants and animals, which organs serve as instruments of production for sustaining life. Does not the history of the productive organs of man, of organs that are the material basis of all social organisation, deserve equal attention? And would not such a history be easier to compile, since, as Vico says, human history differs from natural history in this, that we have made the former, but not the latter? Technology discloses man's mode of dealing with Nature, the process of production by which, he sustains his life, and thereby also lays bare the mode of formation of his social relations, and of the mental conceptions that flow from them.” (MECW Vol 35.375)&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl &amp; Engels, Frederick Collected Works Volume 35. Progress Publishers, Lawrence &amp; Wishart&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==
[[György Lukács]] studied these notebooks while they existed in the archives in [[Moscow]], and appears to refer to them in a 1925 article later published in English translation in the ''[[New Left Review]]'' criticizing what he saw as [[Bukharin]]'s undue technicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Brewster | first = Ben | title = Introduction to Lukács on Bukharin | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = I | issue = 39 | date = September–October 1966 | url = http://newleftreview.org/I/39/ben-brewster-introduction-to-lukacs-on-bukharin | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lukács added a commentary on the methodological importance of this critique to the preface to the new edition (1967) of the English Merlin 1971 translation of ''History and Class Consciousness''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Lukács | first = György | author-link = György Lukács | contribution = Preface | editor-last = Lukács | editor-first = György | editor-link = György Lukács | title = History and Class Consciousness | page = xxxiii | publisher = Merlin | location = London | year = 1971 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Nathan Rosenberg]] published an essay on "Marx as a student of technology" in his ''Inside the Black Box''&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Rosenberg [1982] inside the Black Box: Technology and economics. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and Amy E. Wendling published a book on the notebooks entitled ''Karl Marx on Technology and Alienation'' (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Amy E. Wendling [2009] ''Karl Marx on Technology and Alienation''.
&lt;/ref&gt;. Lucia Pradella in her study of Marx's London Notebooks&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Pradella [2015] ‘Globalisation and the Critique of Political Economy: New Insights from Marx’s writings’.

'''Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services''' ('''MBMS''') is a [[point-to-multipoint]] interface specification for existing and upcoming [[3GPP]] [[cellular network]]s, which is designed to provide efficient delivery of [[broadcast]] and [[multicast]] [[service (economics)|service]]s, both within a cell as well as within the [[core network]]. For broadcast transmission across multiple cells, it defines transmission via [[single-frequency network]] configurations. The specification is referred to as Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (eMBMS) when transmissions are delivered through an [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE (Long Term Evolution)]] network. eMBMS is also known as LTE Broadcast.

Target applications include [[mobile TV]] and radio broadcasting, live streaming video services, as well as file delivery and emergency alerts.

Questions remain whether the technology is an optimization tool for the operator or if an operator can generate new revenues with it. Several studies have been published on the domain identifying both cost savings and new revenues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expway.com/wp-content/uploads/White-Paper-14-LTE-Broadcast-Use-Cases-final.pdf An Analysis of 14 Different LTE Broadcast Business Cases]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deployments ==
In 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2414062,00.asp Verizon Eyes Broadcast Over LTE for Super Bowl 2014] By Chloe Albanesius, PC Magazine, January 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Verizon]] announced that it would launch eMBMS services in 2014, over its nationwide (United States) [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] networks. [[AT&amp;T]] subsequently announced plans to use the 700&amp;nbsp;MHz Lower D and E Block licenses it acquired in 2011 from [[Qualcomm]] for an LTE Broadcast service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/att-use-lower-700-mhz-d-and-e-block-spectrum-lte-broadcast/2013-09-24#ixzz2p5gWKi16 AT&amp;T to use Lower 700 MHz D and E Block spectrum for LTE Broadcast] By Phil Goldstein, FierceWireless, September 24, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Several major operators worldwide have been lining-up to deploy and test the technology. The frontrunners being Verizon in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verizonwireless.com/news/article/2014/05/verizon-wireless-lte-multicast.html Verizon Delivers LTE Multicast Over Commercial 4G LTE Network in Indy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[KT Corporation|Kt]] and [[Jio|Reliance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tele.net.in/view-point/item/15556-rjil-to-invest-in-lte-broadcast-technology-says-market-status-report-by-gsa RJIL to invest in LTE broadcast technology]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Asia]], and recently [[EE Limited|EE]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.totaltele.com/view.aspx?ID=490119]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vodafone]] in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thebroadcastbridge.com/content/entry/3206/europe-charges-ahead-with-lte-broadcast-trials]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Korea’s Kt launched the first commercial LTE Broadcast service.&lt;ref&gt;http://telecoms.com/217182/koreas-kt-launches-lte-broadcast-service/&lt;/ref&gt; The solution includes Kt’s internally developed eMBMS Bearer Service, and [[Samsung]] mobile devices fitted with the Expway Middleware as the eMBMS User Service.

In February 2014, Verizon demonstrated the potential of LTE Broadcast during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]], using [[Samsung Galaxy Note 3]]s, fitted with Expway's eMBMS User Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-uses-super-bowl-to-show-off-lte-broadcast-video/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, [[Nokia]] demonstrated the use of LTE Broadcast to replace Traditional Digital TV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsn.com/news-events/press-room/press-releases/nokia-networks-first-to-trial-lte-for-national-tv-broadcasting Nokia Networks first to trial LTE for national TV broadcasting]&lt;/ref&gt; This use case remains controversial as some study are doubting about the capability of LTE Broadcast to address this use case efficiently in its current version.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/techreports/tr027.pdf Delivery of Broadcast Content over LTE]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in July 2014, [[BBC Research &amp; Development]] and EE demonstrated LTE Broadcast during the [[2014 Commonwealth Games|XX Commonwealth Games]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland using equipment from Huawei and Qualcomm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2014-07-bbc-research-development-to-demonstrate-4g-broadcast-for-commonwealth-games BBC Research &amp; Development to Demonstrate 4G Broadcast for Commonwealth Games] by Andrew Murphy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techworld.com/news/networking/bbc-huawei-ee-unveil-4g-broadcasting-trial-at-commonwealth-games-3531478/ BBC, Huawei and EE unveil 4G broadcasting trial at Commonwealth Games] by Antony Savvas.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Ericsson and Polkomtel successfully tested LTE Broadcast technology by streaming the opening game of the 2014 World Volleyball Championship to hundreds of guests at Warsaw’s National Stadium in Poland on August 30.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ericsson.com/news/1852728&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, BBC Research &amp; Development and EE demonstrated LTE Broadcast during the [[FA Cup]] final in the [[U.K.]]
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2015-05-4g-broadcast-trial-wembley-2015-fa-cup-final 4G Broadcast technology trial at Wembley 2015 FA Cup Final] by Chris Nokes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltveurope.net/375521/ee-and-bbc-trial-4g-broadcast-at-fa-cup-final/ EE and BBC trial 4G broadcast at FA Cup Final].&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Verizon demonstrated eMBMS by broadcasting [[INDYCAR]] races.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.strategyanalytics.com/strategy-analytics/blogs/components/rf-wireless/rf-and-wireless/2015/09/01/lte-broadcast-launches-in-the-us#.VwVminUrKAo&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Verizon commercially launched their [[Go90]] eMBMS service. Go90 offers both On-Demand and LiveTV, in both Unicast and Broadcast, and supports more than 10 different LTE Broadcast mobile devices.
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/10/01/verizon-launches-go90-mobile-video-service/73138654/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[
https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/01/verizons-mobile-video-service-go90-launches-to-public/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnet.com/news/verizon-launches-free-mobile-tv-service-go90/&lt;/ref&gt; Verizon ceased operating the go90 service on July 31, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/go90-shutting-down-verizon-1202860864/&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, [[Akamai Technologies|Akamai]] demonstrated with Expway, delivery of video streams across LTE networks with live on the fly switching from unicast to broadcast, at [[Mobile World Congress]] 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/news/press/2016-press/akamai-showcases-mobile-innovation-at-mobile-world-congress-2016.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, Verizon, [[Telstra]], KT and EE launched the LTE Broadcast Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/story/verizon-telstra-kt-and-ee-launch-lte-broadcast-alliance/2016-04-27|title=Verizon, Telstra, kt and EE launch LTE-Broadcast Alliance  {{!}} FierceWireless|last=Alleven|first=Monica|date=April 27, 2016|website=www.fiercewireless.com|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828085736/https://www.fiercewireless.com/tech/verizon-telstra-kt-and-ee-launch-lte-broadcast-alliance|archive-date=August 28, 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite many technology trials and demonstrations, as of September 2018 there are no commercial deployments of 3G MBMS or 4G eMBMS anywhere in the world.

== Competing technologies ==
Main competing technologies of MBMS include [[DVB-H]]/[[DVB-T]], [[DVB-SH]], [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]], ESM-[[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]], and [[MediaFLO]]. However, due to spectrum scarcity and the cost of building new broadcast infrastructure some of these technologies may not be viable. MediaFLO has been deployed commercially in the US by Verizon Wireless through their relationship with MediaFLO USA, Inc. (a subsidiary of Qualcomm) however the service was shut down in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[MediaFLO]]&lt;/ref&gt; DMB and DVB-H trials have been ongoing for more than a year now, like those during the football 2006 championships in Germany.

Huawei's proprietary CMB is a precursor to the Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service. It was specified in [[3GPP]] R6 and is using existing [[UMTS]] infrastructure. Huawei says that CMB is based on existing UMTS infrastructure and real time streaming application protocol.

The most significant competition is from services that stream individual video feeds to users over uni-cast data connections. While less efficient in certain situations, particularly the traditional case where everyone watches the same stream simultaneously, the user convenience of individual streaming has taken over the vast majority of the mobile media streaming market.

== Technical description ==
The MBMS feature is split into the MBMS Bearer Service and the MBMS User Service and has been defined to be offered over both [[UTRAN]] (i.e. [[WCDMA]], TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA) and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] (where it is often referred to as eMBMS). The MBMS Bearer Service includes a Unicast and a Broadcast Mode. MBMS Operation On-Demand (MOOD) allows dynamic switching between Unicast and Broadcast over LTE, based on configured triggers. The MBMS Bearer Service uses IP multicast addresses for the IP flows. The advantage of the MBMS Bearer Service compared to unicast bearer services (interactive, streaming, etc.) is that the transmission resources in the [[Core network|core]] and [[Radio access network|radio]] networks are shared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ericsson.com/res/thecompany/docs/publications/ericsson_review/2013/er-lte-broadcast.pdf Delivering content with LTE broadcast] By Thorsten Lohmar, Michael Slssingar, Vera Kenehan and Stif Puustinen, Ericsson Review, February 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; One MBMS packet flow is replicated by [[GGSN]], SGSN and RNCs. MBMS may use an advanced counting scheme to decide, whether or not zero, one or more dedicated (i.e. unicast) radio channels lead to a more efficient system usage than one common (i.e. broadcast) radio channel.

* UTRAN MBMS offers up to 256 kbit/s per MBMS Bearer Service and between 800 kbit/s and 1.7 Mbit/s per cell/band. The actual cell capacity depends on the [[User equipment|UE]] capabilities.
* GERAN MBMS offers between 32 kbit/s and 128 kbit/s. Up to 4 GSM timeslots may be used for one MBMS bearer in the downlink direction. The actual data rate per Traffic Slot depends on network dimensioning.

The MBMS User Service is basically the MBMS Service Layer and offers two different data Delivery Methods:

* The '''Streaming Delivery Method''' can be used for continuous transmissions like mobile television services. An application layer [[Forward error correction|FEC]] code may be used To increase the transmission reliability.
* The '''Download Delivery Method''' is intended for “download and play” services. A '''File Repair''' service may be offered to compensate for unreliable delivery.

MBMS has been standardized in various groups of [[3GPP]] (Third Generation Partnership Project), and the first phase standards are found in [[UMTS]] release 6. As Release 6 was functionally frozen by the 3rd quarter of 2004, practical network implementations may be expected by the end of 2007, and the first functional mobile terminals supporting MBMS are estimated to be available by also end of 2007.

eMBMS has been standardized in various groups of 3GPP as part of LTE release 9.  The [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] version of MBMS, referred to as [[Multicast-broadcast single-frequency network]] (MBSFN), supports broadcast only services and is based on a Single Frequency Network (SFN) based [[OFDM]] waveform and so is functional similar to other broadcast solutions such as DVB-H, -SH and -NGH.

'''Music education for young children''' is an educational program introducing children in a playful manner to [[singing]], [[Speech communication|speech]], [[music]], motion and [[organology]]. It is a subarea of [[music education]].

== Benefits ==
There are many benefits that [[music]] provides for children as they continue to grow.  The benefits that young children acquire through music include [[social skills]], [[emotional self-regulation|emotional self-regulating]] abilities, cognitive benefits, and physical benefits.  Socially, children have the opportunity to learn how to take turns and play with others while still playing individually, for example a band of little players each playing their instrument but yet looking at the big picture of playing with a group of little friends as well.  Music also allows a smooth transitioning throughout daily activities, whether it be at home or in a classroom setting children get the idea of the following activity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Allowing children to play with others, including adults or older siblings also gives them a boost of [[self-esteem]].  Also, different songs show children the different words used for [[emotion]]s and body awareness, as well as extending their vocabulary in general.  Additionally, by extending children’s vocabulary they can also learn of different cultural music and languages, for some the benefit to integrate home within their care-giving setting.  Cognitive benefits also include learning how to count, recognizing sequencing and patterns, [[phonemic awareness]], memorizing different songs for different experiences, and simply memorizing songs and their pace and tone.  Physically, children’s all around [[Gross motor skill|gross]] and [[fine motor skill]]s grow rapidly by learning how to move their body to music, moving their bodies to actions of a song, and as they grow by learning how to hold and play an instrument.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.naeyc.org/files/yc/file/201003/ParlakianWeb0310.pdf|title = Beyond Twinkle, Twinkle Using Music with Infants and Toddlers|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = communityplaythings.com - Learning Through Music: The Support of Brain Research|url = http://www.communityplaythings.com/resources/articles/2006/learning-through-music-the-support-of-brain-research|website = www.communityplaythings.com|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms and activities ==
Music education for young children is offered privately through classes and music organizations or integrated into educations private and public schools. Activities and classes can start as early as prenatally or newborn &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suzuki Prenatal and Baby Years|url=http://www.suzukiece.com/pages/prenatal_and_baby.htm|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in private education, music programs are often integrated in as early as preschool. Early childhood music education in public school settings widely varies, but music programs have been established in some schools starting in kindergarten even in remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Juneau, Alaska Music Matters|url=http://juneaumusicmatters.blogspot.ca|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most early childhood music education is accomplished through parent or teacher guided interactive play. Prenatal activities can include singing and playing music so that it can be heard in the womb and continued on with newborns. From birth, children can listen to music and observe other children in music classes and participate in tactile and parent assisted activities. With parental assistance, infants can partake in body movement and rhythm exercises to sung songs and recorded music and through play. As these children develop independent motor skills, they progress to doing these activities on their own. Infants and toddlers are often encouraged to sing and explore rhythm through body movements and percussion instruments such as egg shakers, drums, and xylophones. As young children progress, activities can include concepts that introduce counting, solfege, and notation. Some programs then allow for young children to shift easily into more formalized dance and instrumental instruction starting at a very early age.

==Pedagogies of early childhood music education==

Several pedagogies exist which promote specific methods of training young children in music including [[Orff Schulwerk|Orff]], [[Kodály]], [[Dalcroze]], and the [[Suzuki Method]] are among the most widely recognized of these methods. Many of these pedagogies share commonalities such as music and rhythm development through body movements, folk songs, aural training, and belief that music literacy from an early age is beneficial. Each is known for particular characteristics, such as in [[Dalcroze Eurhythmics]] the use of lifelong body movement and expression through music and private instrumental instruction as early as age two in the Suzuki Method. institutions and teachers often use a combination of these pedagogies even if they might be affiliated with only one.

==World music==
Studies done on children who have had a musical background, have shown that it increases brain function as well as brain stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|website = brainvolts.northwestern.edu|title = Musicians’ Enhanced Neural Differentiation of Speech Sounds Arises Early in Life: Developmental Evidence from Ages 3 to 30|date = |accessdate = |url=http://www.brainvolts.northwestern.edu/documents/Cereb.%20Cortex-2013-Strait-cercor_bht103.pdf |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When children are exposed to music from other countries and cultures, they are able to learn about the instrument while at the same time being educated about a different part of the world.

[[File:Universal South Building.JPG|thumb|NICHCY headquarters in the [[Adams Morgan, Washington, D.C.|Adams Morgan]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
'''National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities (NICHCY''', an acronym derived from its original name, '''National Information Center for Handicapped Children and Youth''') operated as a national centralized information resource on disabilities and special education for children and youth ages birth through 21 years, sponsored by the [[U.S. Department of Education]]. It did so by collecting, organizing and disseminating current, accurate, research-based information about childhood disability and special education. The Center also disseminated information about the  [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the nation's special education law]] and the [[NCLB|No Child Left Behind Act, the nation's general education law]].  NICHCY  focused on research, information dissemination, and providing quality information on teaching and learning.

NICHCY was de-funded by the U.S. Department of Education in 2013. Its website will continue to be available until September 2014, and its resources have been moved to [http://www.parentcenterhub.org/resources/ Center for Parent Information and Resources]. The original NICHCY website carries a short message about the decommissioning of the site following the de-funding of the organization. Here is the text of that notice:

''Regrettably, on September 30, 2013, our funding from the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) at the U.S. Department of Education ended. Our website will remain available until September 2014. Note that the new Center for Parent Information and Resources will be the new home of NICHCY resources. Visit their Resource Library at http://www.parentcenterhub.org/resources/''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the National Dissemination Center|url=http://nichcy.org/about|website=http://nichcy.org/|publisher=The National Dissemination Center|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NICHCY responded to over 2,500 requests for information each year from families, professionals, advocates, government agencies, journalists, and others concerned with issues affecting children and youth with disabilities.

NICHCY’S Research Center connected stakeholders to the knowledge base the field of special education has accumulated over years of investigation and practice.  Approximately 5,000 unique users visited the Research Center’s web site each week to find the latest research news, briefs, and analysis on effective educational practices for children with disabilities.

NICHCY's services, publications, and Web site were available in both English and Spanish. On the [http://www.parentcenterhub.org/resources/ Center for Parent Information and Resources] web site, information is available on: 
* Services for infants and toddlers with disabilities (Early intervention)
* The special education process and IEPs (individualized education programs)
* Fact sheets on disabilities ([[ADHD|Attention Deficit Disorder]], [[Autism|Autism/PDD]], [[Cerebral palsy|Cerebral Palsy]], [[Deaf|Deafness/Hearing Loss]], [[Down syndrome|Down Syndrome]], [[Serious Emotional Disturbance|Emotional Disturbance]], [[Epilepsy]], [[Learning disability|Learning Disabilities]], [[Mental retardation|Mental Retardation]], Severe and/or Multiple Disabilities, Speech-Language Impairments, [[Spina bifida|Spina Bifida]], [[Traumatic brain injury|Traumatic Brain Injury]], and [[Visual impairments|Visual Impairments]])

The '''Nuova Accademia di Belle Arti''', "New Academy of Fine Arts", also known as '''NABA''', is a privately run university in [[Milan]], [[Lombardy]], Italy. It has approximately 3000 students,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naba.it/why-choose-naba/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom are from abroad; it participates in the [[Erasmus Programme]].

==History==

NABA was founded in Milan in 1980.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1994 the Nuova Accademia received one of the forty "Ambrogino" certificates of civic merit awarded each year by the [[Comune]] of Milan.&lt;ref name=ambrogio&gt;[http://www.comune.milano.it/dseserver/ambrogini/attach/elenco%20CIVICHE%20BENEMERENZE_storiche.pdf Benemerenze Civiche (elenco aggiornato all'anno 2011)] (in Italian). Accessed May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 NABA also began hosting a “node”, or center linked to the [[University of Plymouth]]’s Planetary-Collegium research platform,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/273 Planetary-Collegium]&lt;/ref&gt; offering various PhD programs in the arts and technology.

NABA was bought by Bastogi Spa of Milan in 2002. In December 2009 Bastogi sold it to [[Laureate Education]] of [[Baltimore]], Maryland, for €22 million.&lt;ref name=bastogi&gt;[http://www.bastogi.com/it/storia/ Storia]. Bastogi Spa. (in Italian) "History". Accessed May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rep&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2010/01/13/le-scuole-gioiello-del-design-vendute-un.html Le scuole gioiello del design vendute a un colosso americano] ''La Repubblica'', 13 January 2010. (in Italian) "Precious schools of design sold to an American colossus". Accessed May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation and International Programs==

NABA is listed by the [[Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca]], the Italian ministry of education, as a "legally recognized academy" in the AFAM classification of schools of music, art and dance that are considered equivalent to a traditional university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afam.miur.it/argomenti/istituzioni/accademie-di-belle-arti-legalmente-riconosciute.aspx/ AFAM, Alta Formazione Artistica, Musicale e Coreutica: Accademie di belle arti legalmente riconosciute].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9525">[[Image:Venus Flytrap showing trigger hairs.jpg|thumb|The [[Venus flytrap]] is one of a very small group of plants that are capable of rapid movement.]]

'''Rapid plant movement''' encompasses [[plant movements|movement in plant structures]] occurring over a very short period, usually under one second. For example, the [[Venus flytrap]] closes its trap in about 100 [[millisecond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Forterre, Y., J.M. Skotheim, J. Dumais &amp; L. Mahadevan 2005. {{cite web|url= //www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/dumais/Publications/Nature2005.pdf |title=How the Venus flytrap snaps. }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(318&amp;nbsp;KB)}} ''Nature'' '''433''': 421–425. {{doi|10.1038/nature03185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[dogwood bunchberry]]'s [[flower]] opens its [[petal]]s and fires [[pollen]] in less than 0.5 milliseconds. The record is currently held by the [[white mulberry]] tree, with flower movement taking 25 microseconds, as pollen is catapulted from the stamens at velocities in excess of half the [[speed of sound]]—near the theoretical physical limits for movements in plants.&lt;ref name=mulberry&gt;Taylor, P.E., G. Card, J. House, M. H. Dickinson &amp; R.C. Flagan 2006. High-speed pollen release in the white mulberry tree, ''Morus alba'' L.. ''Sexual Plant Reproduction'' '''19'''(1): 19–24. {{DOI|10.1007/s00497-005-0018-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These rapid plant movements differ from the more common, but much slower "growth-movements" of plants, called '''[[tropism]]s'''. Tropisms encompass movements that lead to physical, permanent alterations of the plant while rapid plant movements are usually reversible or occur at over a shorter span of time.

A variety of mechanisms are utilized by plants in order to achieve these fast movements. Extremely fast movements such as the explosive spore dispersal techniques of ''Sphagnum'' mosses may involve increasing internal pressure via dehydration, causing a sudden propulsion of spores up or through the rapid opening of the "flower" opening triggered by insect pollination. Fast movement can also be expressed in predatory plants, where the mechanical stimulation of insect movement creates an electrical action potential and a release of elastic energy within the plant tissues. This release can be seen in the closing of a Venus flytrap, the curling of sundew leaves, and in the trapdoor action and suction of bladderworts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poppinga|first=Simon|last2=Weisskopf|first2=Carmen|last3=Westermeier|first3=Anna Sophia|last4=Masselter|first4=Tom|last5=Speck|first5=Thomas|date=2016-01-01|title=Fastest predators in the plant kingdom: functional morphology and biomechanics of suction traps found in the largest genus of carnivorous plants|url=https://academic.oup.com/aobpla/article/doi/10.1093/aobpla/plv140/2609493/Fastest-predators-in-the-plant-kingdom-functional|journal=AoB PLANTS|volume=8|doi=10.1093/aobpla/plv140|pmc=4717191|pmid=26602984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slower movement such as the folding of ''[[Mimosa pudica]]'' leaves may depend on reversible, but drastic or uneven changes in water pressure in the plant tissues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martone|first=Patrick T.|last2=Boller|first2=Michael|last3=Burgert|first3=Ingo|last4=Dumais|first4=Jacques|last5=Edwards|first5=Joan|last6=Mach|first6=Katharine|last7=Rowe|first7=Nick|last8=Rueggeberg|first8=Markus|last9=Seidel|first9=Robin|date=2010-11-01|title=Mechanics without Muscle: Biomechanical Inspiration from the Plant World|url=https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/50/5/888/644877/Mechanics-without-Muscle-Biomechanical-Inspiration|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=50|issue=5|pages=888–907|doi=10.1093/icb/icq122|issn=1540-7063}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is controlled by the fluctuation of ions in and out of the cell, and the osmotic response of water to the ion flux.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forterre|first=Yoël|date=2013-11-01|title=Slow, fast and furious: understanding the physics of plant movements|url=https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/64/15/4745/462045/Slow-fast-and-furious-understanding-the-physics-of|journal=Journal of Experimental Botany|volume=64|issue=15|pages=4745–4760|doi=10.1093/jxb/ert230|issn=0022-0957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rational emotive behavior therapy''' ('''REBT'''), previously called '''rational therapy''' and '''rational emotive therapy''', is an active-directive, [[philosophy|philosophically]] and [[empirical]]ly based [[psychotherapy]], the aim of which is to resolve [[emotion]]al and [[behavior]]al problems and disturbances and to help people to lead happier and more fulfilling lives.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A. (1994) Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy:  Comprehensive Method of Treating Human Disturbances : Revised and Updated. New York, NY: Citadel Press&lt;/ref&gt; REBT was created and developed by the [[United States|American]] [[psychotherapist]] and [[psychologist]] [[Albert Ellis]], who was inspired by many of the teachings of [[Asia]]n, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and modern philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A. (2004) Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy: It Works for Me—It Can Work for You. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, J., &amp;d Vernon, A. (2010) Albert Ellis: Evolution of a Revolution: Selections from the Writings of Albert Ellis, Ph.D. Fort Lee, NJ: Barricade Books.&lt;/ref&gt; REBT is the first form of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) and was first expounded by Ellis in the mid-1950s; development continued until his death in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, A.

Sarasota, FL: Professional Resource Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis became synonymous with the highly influential therapy. [[Psychology Today]] noted, "No individual — not even Freud himself — has had a greater impact on modern psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, R. (2001). "The Prince of Reason". Psychology Today.&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) is both a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] system of theory and practices and a school of thought established by [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]]. Ellis first presented his ideas at a conference of the American Psychological Association in 1956&lt;ref&gt;[ELLIS, A. Rational Psychotherapy. Paper read at Amer. Psychol. Ass. Chicago, August, 1956. Also J. gen. Psychol., in press]&lt;/ref&gt; then published a seminal article in 1957 entitled "Rational psychotherapy and individual psychology", in which he set the foundation for what he was calling Rational Therapy (RT) and carefully responded to questions from [[Rudolf Dreikurs]] and others about the similarities and differences with [[Alfred Adler]]'s [[Individual psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-about-psychology.com/rational-psychotherapy.html Rational Psychotherapy and Individual Psychology.] Ellis, Albert. 1957.  Journal of Individual Psychology 13: 38-44.&lt;/ref&gt; This was around a decade before psychiatrist [[Aaron Beck]] first set forth his "[[cognitive therapy]]", after Ellis had contacted him in the mid 1960s. Ellis' own approach was renamed to ''Rational Emotive Therapy'' in 1959, then to the current term in 1992.

Precursors of certain fundamental aspects of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy have been identified in ancient philosophical traditions, particularly [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Robertson, D | title=The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy| year=2010| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1-85575-756-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first major book on rational therapy, Ellis wrote that the central principle of his approach, that people are rarely emotionally affected by external events but rather by their thinking about such events, "was originally discovered and stated by the ancient Stoic philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Ellis, A. | title=Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy| year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis illustrates this with a quote from the [[Enchiridion of Epictetus|''Enchiridion'']] of [[Epictetus]]: "Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of them."  Ellis noted that [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] expressed a similar thought in ''[[Hamlet]]'': "There's nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so."&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Albert  (1962) Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis also acknowledges early 20th century therapists, particularly [[Paul Charles Dubois]], though he only read his work several years after developing his therapy.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Theoretical assumptions &lt;!--This section is linked from [[Cognitive therapy]]: do not rename without including an anchor to previous name ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt; ==
{{See also|Cognitive therapy#Cognitive model}}
A fundamental premise of REBT is humans do not get emotionally disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but by how they construct their views of these circumstances through their language, evaluative beliefs, meanings and philosophies about the world, themselves and others.&lt;ref name="ellis1"&gt;Ellis, Albert (2001). Overcoming Destructive Beliefs, Feelings, and Behaviors: New Directions for Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy. [[Prometheus Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been attributed as far back as the Roman philosopher [[Epictetus]], who is often cited as utilizing similar ideas in antiquity.&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getselfhelp.co.uk/epictetus.htm|title=Quotes for Therapy|author=|date=|website=www.getselfhelp.co.uk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In REBT, clients usually learn and begin to apply this premise by learning the ''A-B-C''-''D-E-F'' model of [[psychological]] disturbance and change. The A-B-C model states that it is not an ''A'', ''a''dversity (or ''a''ctivating event) that cause disturbed and dysfunctional emotional and behavioral ''C''s, ''c''onsequences, but also what people ''B'', irrationally ''b''elieve about the ''A'', ''a''dversity. ''A'', ''a''dversity can be an external situation, or a thought, a feeling or other kind of internal event, and it can refer to an event in the past, present, or future.&lt;ref name="dryden1"&gt;Dryden W., &amp; Neenan M. (2003). Essential Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the following letters represent the following meanings in this model

A-	The adversity

B-	The developed belief in the person of the A Adversity

C-	The consequences but the consequences of that person's Beliefs ie B

D-	The person's disputes of A B and C. In latter thought.

E-	The effective new philosophy or belief that develops in that person through the occurrence of D in their minds of A and B

F-	The developed feelings of ones self either at point and after point C or at point after point E.


The ''B''s, irrational beliefs that are most important in the ''A-B-C'' model are explicit and implicit philosophical meanings and assumptions about events, personal desires, and preferences. The ''B''s, ''b''eliefs that are most significant are highly evaluative and consist of interrelated and integrated cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects and dimensions. According to REBT, if a person's evaluative ''B'', ''b''elief about the ''A'', ''a''ctivating event is rigid, absolutistic, fictional and dysfunctional, the ''C'', the emotional and behavioral ''c''onsequence, is likely to be self-defeating and destructive. Alternatively, if a person's belief is preferential, flexible and constructive, the ''C'', the emotional and behavioral ''c''onsequence is likely to be self-helping and constructive.

Through REBT, by understanding the role of their mediating, evaluative and philosophically based illogical, unrealistic and self-defeating meanings, interpretations and assumptions in disturbance, individuals can learn to identify them, then go to ''D'', ''d''isputing and questioning the evidence for them. At ''E, e''ffective new philosophy, they can recognize and reinforce the notion no evidence exists for any psychopathological ''must'', ''ought'' or ''should'' and distinguish them from healthy constructs, and subscribe to more constructive and self-helping philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Albert. (1994). Reason and Emotion In Psychotherapy, Revised and Updated. Secaucus, NJ: Carol Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt; This new reasonable perspective leads to ''F'', new ''f''eelings and behaviors appropriate to the ''A'' they are addressing in the exercise.

The REBT framework assumes that humans have both innate rational (meaning self-helping, socially helping, and constructive) and irrational (meaning self-defeating, socially defeating, and unhelpful) tendencies and leanings. REBT claims that people to a large degree consciously and unconsciously construct emotional difficulties such as [[self-blame]], [[self-pity]], clinical anger, hurt, guilt, shame, [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[anxiety]], and behaviors and behavior tendencies like [[procrastination]], compulsiveness, avoidance, [[Substance dependence|addiction]] and [[Social withdrawal|withdrawal]] by the means of their irrational and self-defeating thinking, [[emotion|emoting]] and behaving.&lt;ref name="ellis3"&gt;Ellis, A. (2001). Feeling better, getting better, staying better. Impact Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; REBT is then applied as an [[education]]al process in which the therapist often active-directively teaches the client how to identify irrational and self-defeating beliefs and philosophies which in nature are rigid, extreme, unrealistic, illogical and absolutist, and then to forcefully and actively question and dispute them and replace them with more rational and self-helping ones. By using different cognitive, emotive and behavioral [[Methodology|methods]] and activities, the client, together with help from the therapist and in [[Homework in psychotherapy|homework]] exercises, can gain a more rational, self-helping and constructive rational way of thinking, emoting and behaving. One of the main [[Goal|objective]]s in REBT is to show the client that whenever unpleasant and unfortunate activating events occur in people's lives, they have a [[choice]] of making themselves feel healthily and self-helpingly sorry, disappointed, frustrated, and annoyed, or making themselves feel unhealthily and self-defeatingly horrified, terrified, panicked, depressed, self-hating and self-pitying.&lt;ref name="ellis2"&gt;Ellis, Albert (2003). Early theories and practices of rational emotive behavior theory and how they have been augmented and revised during the last three decades. Journal of Rational-Emotive &amp; Cognitive-Behavior Therapy, 21(3/4)&lt;/ref&gt; By attaining and ingraining a more rational and self-constructive philosophy of themselves, others and the world, people often are more likely to behave and [[emotion|emote]] in more life-serving and adaptive ways.

Albert Ellis&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt; posits three major insights of REBT:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Insight 1''' – People seeing and accepting the reality that their emotional disturbances at point C are only partially caused by the activating events or adversities at point A that precede C. Although A contributes to C, and although disturbed Cs (such as feelings of [[panic]] and [[clinical depression|depression]]) are much more likely to follow strong negative As (such as being assaulted or raped), than they are to follow weak As (such as being disliked by a stranger), the main or more direct cores of extreme and dysfunctional emotional disturbances (Cs) are people’s irrational beliefs — the "absolutistic" (inflexible) "musts" and their accompanying inferences and attributions that people strongly believe about the activating event.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Insight 2''' – No matter how, when, and why people acquire self-defeating or irrational beliefs (i.e. beliefs that are the main cause of their dysfunctional emotional-behavioral consequences), if they are disturbed in the present, they tend to keep holding these irrational beliefs and continue upsetting themselves with these thoughts. They do so not because they held them in the past, but because they still actively hold them in the present (often unconsciously), while continuing to reaffirm their beliefs and act as if they are still valid. In their minds and hearts, the troubled people still follow the core "musturbatory" philosophies they adopted or invented long ago, or ones they recently accepted or constructed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Insight 3''' – No matter how well they have gained insights 1 and 2, insight alone rarely enables people to undo their emotional disturbances. They may feel better when they know, or think they know, how they became disturbed, because insights can feel useful and curative. But it is unlikely that people will actually get better and stay better unless they have and apply insight 3, which is that ''there is usually no way to get better and stay better except by continual work and practice in looking for and finding one’s core irrational beliefs''; actively, energetically, and scientifically disputing them; replacing one’s absolute "musts" (rigid requirements about how things should be) with more flexible ''preferences''; changing one's unhealthy feelings to healthy, self-helping emotions; and firmly acting against one’s dysfunctional [[fears]] and [[compulsive behavior|compulsions]]. Only by a combined cognitive, emotive, and behavioral, as well as a quite persistent and forceful attack on one's serious emotional problems, is one likely to significantly ameliorate or remove them, and keep them removed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Insight 4 – That in order for point D to occur in ones life often circumstances need to occur or transpire in order for the dispute in ones self and ones own emotions to happen. This way the dispute is reinforced by actions taken by the self if the action is strong enough. However if this is not executed by others with the person in affect not aware of what is going on the situation could become dangerous or life threatening by the person being treated.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding cognitive-affective-behavioral [[cognitive processes|process]]es in mental functioning and dysfunctioning, originator Albert Ellis explains:&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"REBT assumes that human thinking, emotion, and action are not really separate or disparate processes, but that they all significantly overlap and are rarely experienced in a pure state. Much of what we call emotion is nothing more nor less than a certain kind — a biased, prejudiced, or strongly evaluative kind — of thought. But emotions and behaviors significantly influence and affect thinking, just as thinking influences emotions and behaviors. Evaluating is a fundamental characteristic of human [[organisms]] and seems to work in a kind of closed [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] with a [[feedback mechanism]]: First, [[perception]] [[bias]]es response, and then response tends to bias subsequent perception. Also, prior perceptions appear to bias subsequent [[perception]]s, and prior responses appear to bias subsequent responses. What we call feelings almost always have a pronounced evaluating or appraisal element."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

REBT then generally proposes that many of these self-defeating cognitive, emotive and behavioral tendencies are both innately [[biology|biological]] and [[indoctrination|indoctrinated]] early in and during life, and further grow stronger as a person continually revisits, clings and acts on them. Ellis alludes to similarities between REBT and the [[general semantics]] when explaining the role of irrational beliefs in self-defeating tendencies, citing [[Alfred Korzybski]] as a significant modern influence on this thinking.&lt;ref&gt;"REBT particularly follows Korzybski in this respect..." Albert Ellis in ''The Albert Ellis reader: A guide to well-being using rational emotive behavior therapy'', p. 306. [https://books.google.com/books?id=LorJYkPSQOwC&amp;vq Google Books preview] retrieved August 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

REBT differs from other clinical approaches like [[psychoanalysis]] in that it places little emphasis on exploring the past, but instead focuses on changing the current evaluations and philosophical thinking-emoting and behaving in relation to themselves, others and the conditions under which people live.

== Psychological dysfunction ==
One of the main pillars of REBT is that irrational and dysfunctional ways and patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving are contributing to much, though hardly all, human disturbance and emotional and behavioral self-defeatism and social defeatism. REBT generally teaches that when people turn flexible preferences, desires and wishes into grandiose, absolutistic and fatalistic dictates, this tends to contribute to disturbance and upset. These dysfunctional patterns are examples of [[cognitive distortions]].

===Core beliefs that disturb humans===
Albert Ellis has suggested three core beliefs or philosophies that humans tend to disturb themselves through:&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ''"I absolutely MUST, under practically all conditions and at all times, perform well (or outstandingly well) and win the approval (or complete love) of significant others. If I fail in these important—and sacred—respects, that is awful and I am a bad, incompetent, unworthy person, who will probably always fail and deserves to suffer."''
| ''"Other people with whom I relate or associate, absolutely MUST, under practically all conditions and at all times, treat me nicely, considerately and fairly. Otherwise, it is terrible and they are rotten, bad, unworthy people who will always treat me badly and do not deserve a good life and should be severely punished for acting so abominably to me."''
| ''"The conditions under which I live absolutely MUST, at practically all times, be favorable, safe, hassle-free, and quickly and easily enjoyable, and if they are not that way it's awful and horrible and I can't bear it. I can't ever enjoy myself at all. My life is impossible and hardly worth living."''
|-
| Holding this belief when faced with adversity tends to contribute to feelings of [[anxiety]], [[panic]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], and worthlessness.
| Holding this belief when faced with adversity tends to contribute to feelings of anger, rage, fury, and vindictiveness.
| Holding this belief when faced with adversity tends to contribute to [[frustration]] and discomfort, [[Toleration|intolerance]], self-pity, [[anger]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and to behaviors such as [[procrastination]], [[avoidance coping|avoidance]], addictive behaviors and inaction.
|}

===Rigid demands that humans make===
REBT commonly posits that at the core of irrational beliefs there often are explicit or implicit rigid demands and commands, and that extreme [[derivative]]s like awfulizing, frustration [[Toleration|intolerance]], people [[deprecation]] and over-generalizations are accompanied by these.&lt;ref name="dryden1"/&gt; According to REBT the core dysfunctional philosophies in a person's evaluative emotional and behavioral belief system, are also very likely to contribute to unrealistic, arbitrary and crooked inferences and distortions in thinking. REBT therefore first teaches that when people in an insensible and devout way overuse absolutistic, [[dogma]]tic and rigid "shoulds", "musts", and "oughts", they tend to disturb and upset themselves.

===Over-generalization===
Further REBT generally posits that disturbed evaluations to a large degree occur through over-generalization, wherein people exaggerate and globalize events or traits, usually unwanted events or traits or behavior, out of context, while almost always ignoring the positive events or traits or behaviors. For example, awfulizing is partly [[mind|mental]] [[magnification]] of the importance of an unwanted situation to a [[Disaster|catastrophe]] or [[Horror and terror|horror]], elevating the rating of something from bad to worse than it should be, to beyond totally bad, worse than bad to the intolerable and to a "[[holocaust]]". The same exaggeration and overgeneralizing occurs with human rating, wherein humans come to be arbitrarily and [[axiom]]atically [[definition|defined]] by their [[perceive]]d flaws or misdeeds. Frustration intolerance then occurs when a person perceives something to be too difficult, painful or tedious, and by doing so exaggerates these qualities beyond one's ability to cope with them.

===Secondary disturbances===
Essential to REBT theory is also the concept of secondary disturbances which people sometimes construct on top of their primary disturbance. As Ellis emphasizes:&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''Because of their self-consciousness and their ability to think about their thinking, they can very easily disturb themselves about their disturbances and can also disturb themselves about their ineffective attempts to overcome their emotional disturbances.''"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Mental wellness ==
As would be expected, REBT argues that [[mind|mental]] wellness and [[mental health]] to a large degree results from an adequate amount of self-helping, flexible, logico-empirical ways of thinking, emoting and behaving.&lt;ref name="ellis3"/&gt; When a perceived undesired and stressful activating event occurs, and the individual is interpreting, evaluating and reacting to the situation rationally and self-helpingly, then the resulting consequence is, according to REBT, likely to be more healthy, constructive and functional. This does not by any means mean that a relatively un-disturbed person never experiences negative feelings, but REBT does hope to keep debilitating and un-healthy emotions and subsequent self-defeating behavior to a minimum. To do this, REBT generally promotes a flexible, un-dogmatic, self-helping and efficient belief system and constructive life philosophy about adversities and human desires and preferences.

REBT clearly acknowledges that people, in addition to disturbing themselves, also are innately [[Constructivism (psychological school)|constructivists]]. Because they largely upset themselves with their beliefs, emotions and behaviors, they can be helped to, in a [[multimodal therapy|multimodal]] manner, dispute and question these and develop a more workable, more self-helping set of constructs.

REBT generally teaches and promotes:
* That the concepts and philosophies of life of unconditional self-acceptance, other-acceptance, and life-acceptance are effective philosophies of life in achieving mental wellness and [[mental health]].
* That human beings are inherently fallible and imperfect and that they are better served by accepting their and other human being's totality and humanity, while at the same time they may not like some of their behaviors and characteristics. That they are better off not measuring their entire self or their "being" and give up the narrow, grandiose and ultimately destructive notion to give themselves any global rating or report card. This is partly because all humans are continually evolving and are far too complex to accurately rate; all humans do both self-defeating / socially defeating and self-helping / socially helping deeds, and have both beneficial and un-beneficial attributes and traits at certain times and in certain conditions. REBT holds that [[idea]]s and feelings about self-worth are largely definitional and are not empirically confirmable or [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]].
* That people had better accept life with its hassles and difficulties not always in accordance with their wants, while trying to change what they can change and live as elegantly as possible with what they cannot change.

==REBT intervention==
As explained, REBT is a therapeutic system of both theory and practice; generally one of the goals of REBT is to help clients see the ways in which they have learned how they often needlessly upset themselves, teach them how to "un-upset" themselves and then how to [[empowerment|empower]] themselves to lead happier and more fulfilling lives.&lt;ref name="ellis1"/&gt; The emphasis in therapy is generally to establish a successful collaborative therapeutic working alliance based on the REBT educational model. Although REBT teaches that the therapist or counsellor is better served by demonstrating unconditional other-acceptance or unconditional positive regard, the therapist is not necessarily always encouraged to build a warm and caring relationship with the client. The tasks of the therapist or counselor include understanding the client’s concerns from his point of reference and work as a facilitator, teacher and encourager.

In traditional REBT, the client together with the therapist, in a structured active-directive manner, often work through a set of target problems and establish a set of therapeutic goals. In these target problems, situational dysfunctional emotions, behaviors and beliefs are [[Psychological assessment|assessed]] in regards to the client's [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and [[goal]]s. After working through these problems, the client learns to generalize insights to other relevant situations. In many cases after going through a client's different target problems, the therapist is interested in examining possible core beliefs and more deep rooted philosophical evaluations and schemas that might account for a wider array of problematic emotions and behaviors.&lt;ref name="dryden1"/&gt; Although REBT much of the time is used as a brief therapy, in deeper and more complex problems, longer therapy is promoted.

In therapy, the first step often is that the client acknowledges the problems, accepts emotional responsibility for these and has willingness and determination to change. This normally requires a considerable amount of insight, but as originator [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]]&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt; explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Humans, unlike just about all the other animals on earth, create fairly sophisticated [[languages]] which not only enable them to think about their feeling, their actions, and the results they get from doing and not doing certain things, but they also are able to think about their thinking and even [[metacognition|think about thinking about their thinking]]."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Through the therapeutic process, REBT employs a wide array of forceful and active, meaning [[multimodal therapy|multimodal]] and disputing, [[methodology|methodologies]]. Central through these methods and techniques is the intent to help the client challenge, dispute and question their destructive and self-defeating cognitions, emotions and behaviors. The methods and techniques incorporate cognitive-philosophic, emotive-evocative-dramatic, and behavioral methods for disputation of the client's irrational and self-defeating constructs and helps the client come up with more rational and self-constructive ones. REBT seeks to acknowledge that understanding and insight are not enough; in order for clients to significantly change, they need to pinpoint their irrational and self-defeating [[Philosophy of artificial intelligence|constructs]] and work forcefully and actively at changing them to more functional and self-helping ones.

REBT posits that the client must work hard to get better, and in therapy this normally includes a wide array of homework exercises in day-to-day life assigned by the therapist. The [[assignment (education)|assignment]]s may for example include [[desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]] tasks, i.e., by having the client confront the very thing he or she is afraid of. By doing so, the client is actively acting against the belief that often is contributing significantly to the disturbance.

Another factor contributing to the brevity of REBT is that the therapist seeks to empower the client to help himself through future adversities. REBT only promotes temporary solutions if more fundamental solutions are not found. An ideal successful [[collaboration]] between the REBT therapist and a client results in changes to the client's philosophical way of evaluating himself or herself, others, and his or her life, which will likely yield effective results. The client then moves toward unconditional self-acceptance, other-acceptance and life-acceptance while striving to live a more self-fulfilling and happier life.

== Efficacy ==
REBT and CBT in general have a substantial and strong [[research]] base to verify and support both their psychotherapeutic efficiency and their theoretical underpinnings. A great quantity of scientific empirical studies has proven REBT to be an effective and efficient treatment for many kinds of psychopathology, conditions and problems.&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, L. C., &amp; Woods, P. J. (1991). The efficacy of rational-emotive therapy: A quantitative review of the outcome research. Clinical Psychology Review, 11, 357–369.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="feltham"&gt;Colin Feltham (ed) (1997). Which Psychotherapy?: Leading Exponents Explain Their Differences. SAGE, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper M. (2008). Essential Research Findings in Counselling and Psychotherapy. Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; A vast amount of outcome and experimental studies support the effectiveness of REBT and CBT.&lt;ref&gt;Philosophy in Psychotherapy: [http://www.intuition.org/txt/ellis.htm Albert Ellis interview by Jeffrey Mishlove]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Psychotherapy.net: [http://www.psychotherapy.net/interview/Albert_Ellis Albert Ellis Behavioral Therapy Interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225020622/http://www.psychotherapy.net/interview/Albert_Ellis |date=2008-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, REBT randomized clinical trials have offered a positive view on the efficacy of REBT.&lt;ref name="david"&gt;David D. et al. (2005). A synopsis of rational-emotive behavior therapy: Fundamental and applied research. Journal of rational-emotive and cognitive-behavior therapy 2005, vol. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In general REBT is arguably one of the most investigated [[theory|theories]] in the field of psychotherapy and a large amount of clinical experience and a substantial body of modern psychological research have validated and substantiated many of REBTs theoretical assumptions on [[Personality psychology|personality]] and psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="feltham"/&gt;&lt;ref name="david"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"&gt;Ellis A., Abrams M. &amp; Abrams L. (2008). Theories of Personality. Sage Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations and critique ==
{{See also|Cognitive behavioral therapy#Criticisms|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}
The clinical research on REBT has been criticized both from within and by others. For instance, originator [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] has on occasions emphasized the difficulty and complexity of measuring psychotherapeutic effectiveness, because many studies only tend to [[Psychometrics|measure]] whether clients merely feel better after therapy instead of them getting better and staying better.&lt;ref name="ellis3"/&gt; Ellis has also criticized studies for having limited focus primarily to [[cognitive restructuring]] aspects, as opposed to the combination of cognitive, emotive and behavioral aspects of REBT.&lt;ref name="feltham"/&gt; As REBT has been subject to criticisms during its existence, especially in its early years, REBT theorists have a long history of publishing and addressing those concerns. It has also been argued by Ellis and by other clinicians that REBT theory on numerous occasions has been misunderstood and misconstrued both in research and in general.&lt;ref name="david"/&gt;

Some have criticized REBT for being harsh, formulaic and failing to address deep underlying problems.&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; REBT theorists have argued in reply that a careful study of REBT shows that it is both philosophically deep, humanistic and individualized collaboratively working on the basis of the client’s point of reference.&lt;ref name="ellis1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; They have further argued that REBT utilizes an integrated and interrelated methodology of cognitive, emotive-experiential and behavioral interventions.&lt;ref name="ellis1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="feltham"/&gt; Others have questioned REBTs view of rationality, both radical constructivists who have claimed that reason and logic are subjective properties and those who believe that reason can be objectively determined.&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; REBT theorists have argued in reply that REBT raises objections to clients' irrational choices and conclusions as a working hypothesis and through collaborative efforts demonstrate the irrationality on practical, functional and social consensual grounds.&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; In 1998 when asked what the main criticism on REBT was, Albert Ellis replied that it was the claim that it was too rational and not dealing sufficiently enough with emotions. He repudiated the claim by saying that REBT on the contrary emphasizes that thinking, feeling, and behaving are interrelated and integrated, and that it includes a vast amount of both emotional and behavioural methods in addition to cognitive ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ask Dr. Ellis Achieve (1996–2001). Albert Ellis Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis has himself in very direct terms criticized opposing approaches such as [[psychoanalysis]], [[transpersonal psychology]] and abreactive psychotherapies in addition to on several occasions questioning some of the [[doctrine]]s in certain religious systems, [[spiritualism]] and [[mysticism]]. Many, including REBT practitioners, have warned against [[dogma]]tizing and sanctifying REBT as a supposedly perfect psychological [[panacea]]. Prominent REBTers have promoted the importance of high quality and programmatic research, including originator Ellis, a self-proclaimed "passionate skeptic". He has on many occasions been open to challenges and acknowledged errors and inefficiencies in his approach and concurrently revised his theories and practices.&lt;ref name="ellis2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abrams"/&gt; In general, with regard to cognitive-behavioral psychotherapies' [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]]s, others have pointed out that as about 30–40% of people are still unresponsive to interventions, that REBT could be a platform of reinvigorating empirical studies on the effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral models of psychopathology and human functioning.&lt;ref name="david"/&gt;

REBT has been developed, revised and augmented through the years as understanding and knowledge of psychology and psychotherapy have progressed. This includes its theoretical concepts, practices and methodology. The teaching of scientific thinking, reasonableness and [[Dogma|un-dogmatism]] has been inherent in REBT as an approach, and these ways of thinking are an inextricable part of REBT's [[empiricism|empirical]] and [[skepticism|skeptical]] nature.

==Applications and interfaces==
Applications and interfaces of REBT are used with a broad range of clinical problems in traditional psychotherapeutic settings such as individual-, [[Group psychotherapy|group]]- and [[family therapy]]. It is used as a general treatment for a vast number of different conditions and psychological problems normally associated with [[psychotherapy]].

In addition, REBT is used with non-clinical problems and problems of living through [[counselling]], consultation and coaching settings dealing with problems including relationships, social skills, career changes, [[stress management]], assertiveness training, grief, problems with aging, money, weight control etc.

REBT also has many interfaces and applications through self-help resources, phone and internet counseling, workshops &amp; seminars, workplace and educational programmes, etc. This includes Rational Emotive Education (REE) where REBT is applied in education settings, Rational Effectiveness Training in business and work-settings and [[SMART Recovery]] (Self Management And Recovery Training) in supporting those in addiction recovery, in addition to a wide variety of specialized treatment strategies and applications.

'''Rhizoids''' are protuberances that extend from the lower [[epidermis (botany)|epidermal cells]] of [[bryophyte]]s and [[algae]]. They are similar in structure and function to the [[root hair]]s of [[vascular plant|vascular]] [[land plants]]. Similar structures are formed by some [[fungi]]. Rhizoids may be unicellular or multicellular.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, R.L. 1987. ''Seaweeds of the British Isles. Volume 3 Fucophyceae (Phaeophyceae)'' British Museum (Natural History){{ISBN|0-565-00992-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Root]]s are multicellular [[organ (anatomy)#Plants|organs]] composed of multiple tissues that collectively carry out a common function.

Plants originated in aquatic environments and gradually migrated to land during their long course of evolution. In water or near it, plants could absorb water from their surroundings, with no need for any special absorbing organ or tissue. Additionally, in the primitive states of plant development, tissue differentiation and division of labor was minimal, thus the requirement for specialized water absorbing tissue was not required. Once plants colonized land however, they required specialized tissues to absorb water efficiently, and also to anchor themselves to the land.

Rhizoids absorb water by capillary action, in which water moves up between threads of rhizoids and not through each of them as it does in roots.

In [[fungi]], rhizoids are small branching [[hyphae]] that grow downwards from the [[stolon]]s that anchor the fungus to the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]], where they release digestive [[enzyme]]s and absorb digested organic material. That is why fungí are called [[heterotrophs]] by absorption.
In land plants, rhizoids are [[trichome]]s that anchor the [[plant]] to the ground. In the [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], they are absent or unicellular, but multicelled in [[moss]]es. In [[vascular plant]]s they are often called [[Trichome#Root hairs|root hairs]], and may be unicellular or multicellular.

In certain [[algae]], there is an extensive rhizoidal system that allows the alga to anchor itself to a sandy substrate from which it can absorb nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304377009001302 | doi=10.1016/j.aquabot.2009.10.012 | volume=92 | title=Comparative phosphate acquisition in giant-celled rhizophytic algae (Bryopsidales, Chlorophyta): Fleshy vs. calcified forms | year=2010 | journal=Aquatic Botany | pages=157–160 | last1 = Demes | first1 = Kyle W. | last2 = Littler | first2 = Mark M. | last3 = Littler | first3 = Diane S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microscopic free-floating species, however, do not have rhizoids at all.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, G.M.1955.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10571">In [[behavioral psychology]], '''stimulus control''' is a phenomenon that occurs when an organism behaves in one way in the presence of a given [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] and another way in its absence. Any stimulus that modifies behavior in this manner is referred to as a ''[[wikt:discriminative stimulus|discriminative stimulus]]''.  ''Stimulus control of behavior'' occurs when the performance of a particular behavior is controlled by the presence or absence of a discriminative stimulus. For example, the presence of a [[stop sign]] (a discriminative stimulus) at a traffic  intersection increases the probability that "braking" behavior will occur.

Some theorists believe that all behavior is under some form of stimulus control.&lt;ref name = Baum&gt;{{cite book|last=Baum|first=William M.|title=Understanding behaviorism : Behavior, culture, and evolution.|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Pub.|location=Malden, MA|isbn=140511262X|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the analysis of [[B. F. Skinner]],&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Burrhus Frederick (1957). Verbal Behavior. Acton, MA: Copley Publishing Group. {{ISBN|1-58390-021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Verbal Behavior|verbal behavior]] is a complicated assortment of behaviors with a variety of controlling stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skinner|first=B.F.|title=Verbal behavior|year=1992|publisher=Copley|location=Acton, Mass.|isbn=1583900217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The controlling effects of stimuli are seen in quite diverse situations and in many aspects of behavior.  For example, a stimulus presented at one time may control responses emitted immediately or at a later time; two stimuli may control the same behavior; a single stimulus may trigger behavior A at one time and behavior B at another; a stimulus may control behavior only in the presence of another stimulus, and so on. These sorts of control are brought about by a variety of methods and they play a large role in systematic accounts of behavioral processes.&lt;ref&gt;Catania, A. C. "Learning" 3rd ed, 1992, Prentice Hall, Englewoood Cliffs, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

In simple, practical situations, for example if one were training a dog using operant conditioning, optimal stimulus control might be described as follows: 
* The behavior occurs immediately when the discriminative stimulus is given.
* The behavior never occurs in the absence of the stimulus.
* The behavior never occurs in response to some other stimulus.
* No other behavior occurs in response to this stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pryor | first = Karen | title = Don't Shoot the Dog! | publisher = Ringpress Books Ltd | location = City | year = 2002 | isbn = 1-86054-238-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishing stimulus control through operant conditioning==
{{main|Operant conditioning}}

===Discrimination training===
Operant stimulus control is typically established by discrimination training.  For example, to make a light control a pigeon's pecks on a button, reinforcement only occurs following a peck to the button.  Over a series of trials the pecking response becomes more probable in the presence of the light and less probable in its absence, and the light is said to become a discriminative stimulus or S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watanabe|first=S|author2=Sakamoto, K. |author3=Wakita, M. |title=Pigeons’ discrimination of paintings by Monet and Picasso|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|year=1994|volume=63|issue=2|pages=165–174|doi=10.1901/jeab.1995.63-165|pmid=16812755|pmc=1334394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually any stimulus that the animal can perceive may become a discriminative stimulus, and many different schedules of reinforcement may be used to establish stimulus control. For example, a green light might be associated with a VR 10 schedule and a red light associated with a FI 20-sec schedule, in which case the green light will control a higher rate of response than the red light.

===Generalization===
After a discriminative stimulus is established, similar stimuli are found to evoke the controlled response. This is called ''stimulus generalization''. As the stimulus becomes less and less similar to the original discriminative stimulus, response strength declines; measurements of the response thus describe a ''generalization gradient''.

An experiment by Hanson (1959)&lt;ref name = Hanson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanson|first=H. M.|title=Effects of discrimination training on stimulus generalization|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1959|volume=58|pages=321–334|doi=10.1037/h0042606}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an early, influential example of the many experiments that have explored the generalization phenomenon. First a group of pigeons was reinforced for pecking a disc illuminated by a light of 550&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength, and never reinforced otherwise. Reinforcement was then stopped, and a series of different wavelength lights was presented one at a time. The data were displayed as a generalization gradient: the more the wavelength differed from the trained stimulus, the fewer responses were produced.&lt;ref name="Hanson"/&gt;

Many factors modulate the generalization process. One is illustrated by the remainder of Hanson's study, which examined the effects of discrimination training on the shape of the generalization gradient. Birds were reinforced for pecking at a 550&amp;nbsp;nm light, which looks yellowish-green to human observers. The birds were not reinforced when they saw a wavelength more toward the red end of the spectrum. Each of four groups saw a single unreinforced wavelength, either 555 , 560, 570, or 590&amp;nbsp;nm, in addition to the reinforced 550 wavelength. The birds were then tested as before, with a range of unreinforced wavelengths. This procedure yielded sharper generalization gradients than did the simple generalization procedure used in the first procedure. In addition, however, Hansen's experiment showed a new phenomenon, called the "peak shift".  That is, the peak of the test gradients shifted away from the S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;, such that the birds responded more often to a wavelength they had never seen before than to the reinforced S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;. An earlier theory involving inhibitory and excitatory gradients partially explained the results,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spence|first=K. W.|title=The differential response in animals to stimuli varying in a single dimension|journal=Psychological Review|year=1937|volume=44|pages=430–444|doi=10.1037/h0062885}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more detailed quantitative model of the effect was proposed by Blough (1975).&lt;ref&gt;Blough, D. S. "Steady state data and a quantitative model of operant generalization and discrimination" Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Process, 1975, 104, 3-21.)&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories have been proposed, including the idea that the peak shift is an example of relational control; that is, the discrimination was perceived as a choice between the "greener" of two stimuli, and when a still greener stimulus was offered the pigeons responded even more rapidly to that than to the originally reinforced stimulus.&lt;ref name = Rachlin&gt;{{cite book|last=Rachlin|first=Howard|title=Introduction to modern behaviorism|year=1991|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=New York|isbn=0716721767|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Matching to sample ==

In a typical matching-to-sample task, a stimulus is presented in one location (the "sample"), and the subject chooses a stimulus in another location that matches the sample in some way (e.g., shape or color).&lt;ref&gt;Blough, D. S. "Delayed matching in the pigeon" Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 1959, 2, 151-160&lt;/ref&gt; In the related "oddity" matching procedure,  the subject responds to a comparison stimulus that does not match the sample. These are called "conditional" discrimination tasks because which stimulus is responded to depends or is "conditional" on the sample stimulus.

The matching-to-sample procedure has been used to study a very wide range of problems.  Of particular note is the "delayed matching to sample" variation, which has often been used to study [[short-term memory]] in animals.  In this variation, the subject is exposed to the sample stimulus, and then the sample is removed and a time interval, the "delay", elapses before the choice stimuli appear.  To make a correct choice the subject has to retain information about the sample across the delay.  The length of the delay, the nature of the stimuli, events during the delay, and many other factors have been found to influence performance on this task.&lt;ref&gt;Bouton, M. E.  "Learning and Behavior: A Contemporary Synthesis" (second edition) Sunderland MA: Sinauer&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cannabinoids ==
[[Psychoactive drug|Psychoactive]] [[cannabinoid]]s from the [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] plant ([[Cannabinoid#Phytocannabinoids|phytocannabinoids]]), from the body ([[Cannabinoid#Endocannabinoids|endocannabinoids]]), and from the research lab ([[Cannabinoid#Synthetic cannabinoids|synthetic cannabinoids]]) produce their discriminative stimulus effects by stimulation of [[Cannabinoid receptor type 1|CB1 receptors]] in the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wiley|first=Jenny L.|last2=Owens|first2=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4196">A '''sudden ionospheric disturbance''' ('''SID''') is an abnormally high '''ionization/[[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]'''  density in the [[D region]] of the [[ionosphere]] caused by a [[solar flare]]. The SID results in a sudden increase in radio-wave absorption that is most severe in the upper [[medium frequency]] (MF) and lower [[high frequency]] (HF) ranges, and as a result often interrupts or interferes with [[telecommunication]]s systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Standard 1037C]] ''Glossary of Telecommunications Terms'', http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/fs-1037c.htm, retrieved 2011 Dec 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The ''Dellinger effect'', or sometimes ''Mögel–Dellinger effect'', is another name for a sudden ionospheric disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect was discovered by [[John Howard Dellinger]] around 1935 and also described by the German physicist [[Hans Mögel]] (1900-1944) in 1930.  The fadeouts are characterized by sudden onset and a recovery that takes minutes or hours.

==Cause==
When a solar flare occurs on the [[Sun]] a blast of intense [[ultraviolet]] and [[x-ray]] radiation hits the dayside of the Earth after a propagation time of about 8 minutes. This high energy [[radiation]] is absorbed by atmospheric particles, raising them to excited states and knocking [[electron]]s free in the process of [[photoionization]]. The low altitude ionospheric layers ([[D region]] and [[E region]]) immediately increase in density over the entire dayside. The ionospheric disturbance enhances VLF radio propagation. Scientists on the ground can use this enhancement to detect solar flares; by monitoring the signal strength of a distant VLF transmitter, sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) are recorded and indicate when solar flares have taken place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aavso.org/observing/programs/solar/sid.shtml AAVSO: SIDs - Sudden Ionospheric Disturbances&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The small geomagnetic effect in the lower ionosphere appears as a small hook on magnetic records and is therefore called "geomagnetic crochet effect" or "sudden field effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Bartels, J | author2=Bartels, J., (editor.) | author3=SpringerLink (Online service) | title=Geophysik III | publication-date=1967 | publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg | page=362 | isbn=978-3-642-46082-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on radio waves==
Short wave radio waves (in the [[High frequency|HF]] range) are absorbed by the increased particles in the low altitude [[ionosphere]] causing a complete blackout of radio communications. This is called a [[short wave]] [[fading]]. These fadeouts last for a few minutes to a few hours and are most severe in the equatorial regions where the Sun is most directly overhead. The ionospheric disturbance enhances long wave ([[Very low frequency|VLF]]) radio propagation. SIDs are observed and recorded by monitoring the signal strength of a distant VLF [[transmitter]].
A whole array of sub-classes of SIDs exist, detectable by different techniques at various wavelengths: the SPA (Sudden Phase Anomaly), SFD (Sudden Frequency Deviation), SCNA (Sudden Cosmic Noise Absorption), SEA (Sudden Enhancement of Atmospherics), etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7288">Germany has an [[air pollution]] control [[regulation]] titled "Technical Instructions on Air Quality Control" (''Technische Anleitung zur Reinhaltung der Luft'') and commonly referred to as the '''''TA Luft'''''.&lt;ref name="TA Luft"&gt;[http://www.bmub.bund.de/fileadmin/Daten_BMU/Download_PDF/Luft/taluft_engl.pdf Complete text of the TA Luft]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first version of the ''TA Luft'' was established in 1964. It has subsequently been revised in 1974, 1983, 1988 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030123190721/http://www.inece.org/1stvol2/Ubing%20&amp;%20Krop.htm History of the TA Luft]&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the ''TA Luft'' have been adopted by other countries as well.

In 1974, 10 years after the ''TA Luft'' was first established, the [[German government]] enacted the "Federal Pollution Control Act" (''Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz''). It also has subsequently been amended a number of times, the last of which was in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmu.de/files/pdfs/allgemein/application/pdf/bimschengl.pdf Complete text of the Federal Air Pollution Control Act] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911214827/http://www.bmu.de/files/pdfs/allgemein/application/pdf/bimschengl.pdf |date=2006-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the first version of the ''TA Luft'' existed 10 years before the enactment of the "Federal Pollution Control Act", it is often called the "First General Administrative Regulation" pertaining to the "Federal Pollution Control Act".

The German government created the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and [[Nuclear safety|Nuclear Safety]] (''Bundesministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit'') in June, 1986&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmu.de/english/the_ministry/tasks/the_ministry/doc/3261.php Web site of the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is now responsible for implementing the ''TA Luft'' regulation under the "Federal Air Pollution Control Act".

==Overview==
The TA Luft is a comprehensive air pollution control regulation that includes:
* A discussion of the scope of the TA Luft application, which is to review applications for licenses to construct and operate new industrial facilities (or altered existing facilities) and to determine whether the proposed new or altered facilities will comply with the requirements of the TA Luft and the requirements of other air pollutant emission regulations promulgated under the ''Federal Pollution Control Act''.
* Air pollutant emission limits for [[dust]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]], [[hydrofluoric acid]] and other gaseous [[inorganic]] [[fluorine]] compounds, [[arsenic]] and inorganic arsenic compounds, [[lead]] and inorganic lead compounds, [[cadmium]] and inorganic cadmium compounds, [[nickel]] and inorganic nickel compounds, [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and inorganic mercury compounds, [[thallium]] and inorganic thallium compounds, [[ammonia]] from farming and livestock breeding operations, inorganic gases and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]], [[Organic chemistry|organic]] substances and others.
* Emission limits may also be set for hazardous, toxic, carcinogenic or mutagenic substances as part of the TA Luft review procedures.
* Other limits or requirements related to stack heights (for flue gases or other process vents) and for storing, loading or working with liquid or solid substances. 
* Various requirements for sampling measuring and monitoring emissions.
* Listing of the industries subject to the requirements of the TA Luft, such as [[mining]], [[power plant|electric power generation]], [[glass]] and ceramics, [[steel]], [[aluminum]] and other metals, [[chemical plant]]s, [[oil refinery|oil refining]], plastics, food, and others.
*Annex 3 is devoted to guidelines on: how the [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]] required during the TA Luft review is to be performed, and the acceptable type of dispersion model to be used. In essence, the modeling must be in accordance with the [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]] Guidelines 3782 Parts 1 and 2, 3783 Part 8, 3784 Part 2, and 3945 Part 3.&lt;ref name="VDI"&gt;[http://www.vdi.de/vdi/english/index.php The VDI web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The full text of the TA Luft is available on the Internet.&lt;ref name="TA Luft"/&gt;

==AUSTAL2000==
[[AUSTAL2000]] is an [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion model]] for simulating the dispersion of air pollutants in the ambient [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. It was developed by Ingenieurbüro Janicke&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austal2000.de/en/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; in Dunum, Germany under contract to the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety. Although not named in the TA Luft, it is the reference dispersion model accepted as being in compliance with the requirements of Annex 3 of the TA Luft and the pertinent VDI Guidelines.

It simulates the dispersion of air pollutants by utilizing a [[random walk]] process ([[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Lagrangian simulation model]]) and it has capabilities for [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|building effects]], complex terrain, [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|pollutant plume]] depletion by [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|wet or dry deposition]], and first order chemical reactions. It is available for download on the Internet free of cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austal2000.de/en/downloads.html Austal2000 download web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Austal2000G is a similar model for simulating the dispersion of odours and it was also developed by Ingenieurbüro Janicke. The development of Austal 2000G was financed by three German states: Niedersachsen, Nordrhein-Westfalen and Baden-Württemberg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11833">'''Tissue stress''' (tissue adaptive syndrome) is an unspecific adaptive reaction universal for all tissues of adult organism which forms in tissue as a response to various external influences. The latter are tissue cells’ damage, overload of their specialized functions or regulatory influences.

==Tissue stress mechanism==
According to tissue adaptive syndrome (TAS) concept, this adaptive mechanism (see adaptation) comes into effect in damaged tissue (see [[Tissue (biology)]]) as a result of concurrence of two events. The first one is accumulation of TAS effectors in tissue ([[comuton]]s, [[chalone (protein)|chalone]]s, and [[contactin]]s), which possess a unique feature of tissue specificity in their action on homologous tissue cells without species specificity. The second one is increase in sensitivity of damaged cells to these regulators, as it was demonstrated on the example of comuton. These effectors cause tissuespecific self-damage of homologous cells via disturbance of their ion homeostasis and energy-production processes. As a result, unspecific reaction to damage (CURD) is activated in the cells. This universal physiological reaction plays a role of TAS executive mechanism. Thus, the adaptive function of tissue stress is brought into action using such CURD properties as increase of cell unspecific resistance, as well as influence on the rate of cell metabolic processes. It is obvious that in the case of TAS these changes have to be tissuespecific, since they are initiated by way of cell self-damage under tissuespecific influence of TAS effectors.

As is well known the CURD consists of two phases. In the process of a slight damage of the cell the phase of metabolism stimulation is forming in it. When the cell is slightly damaged, it begins to form the phase of metabolism stimulation. Strong damaging influences initiate the CURD phase of metabolism inhibition in the cell.

According to the TAS concept, the protective effect of the tissue stress is realized in the case of forming of CURD metabolism stimulation phase by TAS effectors as a result of acceleration of reparative processes in the damaged cell. In the process of forming of CURD phase of metabolism inhibition by the above effectors the protective influence of tissue stress develops a result of cell reactivity decrease in response to the external damaging influences.

==The place of the tissue stress in line of the unspecific adaptive reactions==
The main feature of the tissue stress is its formation with participation of the tissuespecific effectors of intratissue intercellular interactions – comutons, chalones and contactins, which are produced by the cells of a tissue under a stressor’s influence. This distinguishes the tissue stress from the general adaptive syndrome, which is realized via hormones – effectors of interorgan interactions (see [[Stress (biological)]]). Regional (local) stress forms with participation of not one but several tissues making up an organ or a body part. This is why it can be believed that regional stress-reaction is realized with the participation of effectors of intraorgan intertissue interactions. Finally, the cell stress is realized via intracellular mechanisms, without any participation of intercellular interactions. In the latter case the CURD formation and synthesis of heat shock proteins act as “self-defense” mechanism of the cell.

Another distinctive feature of tissue stress is the principle of formation of its executive mechanism, the CURD, via tissuespecific self-damage of homologous tissue cells. Despite the fact that TAS, just as the cell stress, is realized via CURD, the TAS has a variety of features which distinguish it from the cell stress, the key one being the tissue-selectivity of CURD initiation under TAS effectors influence. In addition, under cell stress the cell protection is realized with CURD participation only via “passive” mechanism. It consists in the formation of the protective phase of this physiological reaction. Meanwhile, under tissue stress, its protective function may be carried out both the “passive” and “active” CURD-induced mechanisms. Thus, the cell stress mechanism is just one of the two instruments with which TAS protects the cells of homologous tissue. The third difference between tissue and cell stresses lies in ability of the former not only to increase but also to decrease the unspecific resistance of the cells. Meanwhile, the cell stress concept considers only the first possibility.

At the present moment, two physiological functions of tissue stress, which are realized in the process of participation of its adaptive mechanism, can be considered. One of them is expressed in an increase of cell specialized functions stability in the conditions of prolonged functional load. Another tissue stress function is to regulate homologous tissue cell mass in various physiological conditions.

==Tissue stress function on homologous tissue cells specialized functions stability improvement==
It is well known that only some part of tissue functional units participate in its cells specialized functions realization (Barcroft, 1937). Because of universality of this phenomenon it was named “the law of intermittent activity of functioning structures” (Kryshanovskii, 1973; Kryshanovskii, 1974). According to this law, functional units of actively functioning tissue (or cells) form two populations where one is in “intensive functioning” state and the other one – is in “resting” state.
Thereat the “rest” is not a passive state since there active reparation of cellular structures occurs damaged in the course of specialized functions performing by cells. “Intermittent” pattern of tissue cells specialized functions realization is that the cells pass from one population to another when the tissue is in intensive functioning mode. In such a way the cells damaged in consequence of intensive functioning gain an offing to recover in “resting” population. Meanwhile, recovered cells pass from the “resting” population into “intensively functioning” one. It is safe to say that such organization of tissue functioning favors stability of its cells functions performance. Yet, the mechanisms which regulate cells passage from one population to another on intratissue level are unknown.

Considering the law of “intermittent activity of functioning structures” one can talk about two results of the TAS mechanism action on the cells of actively functioning tissue. In conditions where the TAS effector (effectors) forms CURD phase of metabolism stimulation one should expect an acceleration of reparative processes in the cells of “resting” population. Obviously that will promote accelerated recovery of such cells and their pass to intensively functioning cell population. In case if TAS mechanism forms the CURD phase of metabolism inhibition in intensively functioning cells population this will lead to cell signaling inhibition and promote cells “autonomy” from other external influences. Such autonomy may provoke an inhibition of cell’s specialized functions in mentioned population in case if they are stimulated by external regulatory influences. An inhibition of cells specialized functions by the TAS mechanism may promote defense of intensively functioning cells from self-damage and also their pass into the “resting” state. Thus, the properties of tissue stress executive mechanism – CURD – allow it to raise tissue functions stability in conditions of continuous intensive activity in many ways.

==Tissue stress function on regulation of homologous tissue cell mass==
According to the TAS concept, tissue stress possess the ability to regulate the cell mass of homologous tissue via executive mechanism described above – the CURD. As in the case of cells specialized functions regulation there are two ways of tissue-specific control of homologous tissue cell mass. These are cells unspecific resistance modulation and influencing the speed of physiological processes occurring in the cell.

Tissue stress mechanism able to control tissue cell mass influencing both its mitotic and apoptotic (see [[Apoptosis]]) activities tissue-specifically. In case if TAS effectors form CURD phase of metabolism stimulation one should expect acceleration of proliferative (see [[cell growth|Proliferation]]) pool cells passage through mitotic cycle (MC). Herewith there will be also an acceleration of cells maturation and ageing. This will provoke an increase of both mitotic and apoptotic activity in tissue. On the contrary, formation of CURD phase of metabolism protective inhibition should result in opposite results – an inhibition of all mentioned processes and, as a result, to inhibition of both mitotic and apoptotic activities. One cannot exclude the possibility that tissue stress mechanism considered able to regulate apoptosis through inhibition of its energy-dependent stage. As concerns the modulation of cells unspecific resistance by tissue stress mechanism, this property of CURD allows to regulate cells entrance into MC as well as their entrance into apoptosis.

Regulation of tissue cell mass by the TAS mechanism can be carried out in two physiological regimes – ether by formation of “conservative” or “dynamic” phase of this adaptive reaction. TAS conservative phase is forming under the influence of “weak” unspecific external damaging or “load” influences on cells specialized functions. Here tissue stress provides intratissue adaptation by preservation of the existing cell population in the tissue. It is achieved by raise of cells unspecific resistance under the influence of tissue-specific self-damage of cells by TAS effectors. This prevents entrance of postmitotic cells both into MC and apoptosis. The TAS dynamic phase forms under “strong” external unspecific damaging or “loading” influences on cells specialized functions. According to TAS concept in dynamic phase of tissue stress a summation of damaging influence of stressor (stressors) with cells self-damage by TAS effectors occurs. This leads to stimulation of proliferation (see [[cell growth|Proliferation]]) and to an increase of apoptotic activity (see [[Apoptosis]]) simultaneously. Thus, in above case adaptive function of tissue stress realizes by replacement of damaged, dying cells by descendents of cells more resistant to stressor(s) influence.

As is clear from the foregoing according the TAS concept tissue stress mechanism effect on homologous tissue cells is multifarious. It may protect them against the unspecific damaging influences as well as to increase stability of tissue specialized functions in the conditions of prolonged intensive functional activity. Simultaneously, the same mechanism performs intratissue control of cell mass of homologous tissue.

==History==
Prior to founding Woodbine Manufacturing Company, Delbert Brown manufactured farming equipment as Brown Manufacturing Company. After inventing what was then one of the first trenching machines, Brown Manufacturing Company was sold to [[Omaha Steel Works]]. Three years later, Brown founded Woodbine Manufacturing Company and began the Tommy Gate brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.omaha.com/money/iowa-maker-of-lift-gates-meets-demand-with-help-of/article_7d6b8b6d-1daa-5efd-b2f5-180811e25268.html |author=Cole Epley |title=Iowa Maker of Lift Gates Meets Demand With Help of Night Crew |publisher=The Omaha World-Herald |date=April 21, 2015 |accessdate=September 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
[[File:Tommy_Gate_Factory_2014.png|265px|thumb|right|The Tommy Gate factory circa 2014.]]
The Woodbine manufacturing facility was initially built in 1965 to occupy 70,000 square feet of production space. It expanded in 1980 to 90,000 and once again in 2000 when it grew to 140,000.

The '''Department of Computer Science''' is one of nine departments in the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]] [[UP College of Engineering|College of Engineering]].

==Academic programs==
The Department of Computer Science administers the four-year bachelor of science in computer science program and the master of science in computer science program. As of AY 2009-2010, the department had 553 undergraduate and 89 graduate students mentored by 27 faculty members, seven of whom are PhD degree holders.

===Undergraduate===
The bachelor of science in computer science program is designed to equip the student with knowledge of the fundamental concepts and a reasonable mastery of the basic tools and techniques in computer science. The undergraduate program incorporates the core material, which is universally accepted as common to computer science undergraduate programs ([[computer programming]], computer organization, [[computer system]]s, [[data structures]] and [[algorithms]], file processing, and [[programming languages]]). Underpinning the software orientation of the program are the subjects on [[database systems]], [[software engineering]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[computer networks]] and special problems (primarily, software projects).

===Graduate===
The master of science in computer science program aims to provide the student with both breadth and depth of knowledge in the concepts and techniques related to the design, programming, and application of computing systems.

The doctor of philosophy in computer science program aims to develop computer scientists who are armed with methods, tools and techniques from both theoretical and systems aspects of computing. They should be able to formulate computing problems and develop new and innovative technology as novel solutions to address those problems. The graduates gain expertise to independently contribute to research and development (R&amp;D) in a specialized area of computer science. The program prepares graduates for professional and research careers in industry, government or academe.

==History==
The Department of Computer Science is the youngest department of the college. Its beginnings can be traced to the mid-1970s with the insititution of the master of engineering in computer science (Mengg CS) program. This was jointly administered by three departments: the Department of Engineering Sciences (ES) and the Department of Electrical Engineering (EE), and the Department of Mathematics, of the College of Science. Led by the Department of Engineering Sciences, the Mengg CS program continued in the early 1980s until it was replaced by the bachelor in computer science (BCS) program.

As with the master's program, the BCS program was also a joint undertaking of the ES, EE, and Mathematics departments. An initial batch of 35 shiftees from more than 200 applicants from various colleges in the UPD were admitted into the program in the second semester of AY 1982-1983. Of the 35, 32 finished the course, 12 with Latin honors. In this first batch of computer science graduates was the 1986 engineering class valedictorian.

In August 1988, the BOR approved the renaming of the ES Department to 'Department of Engineering and Computer Sciences (ECS)' to reflect the expertise available in the department. Three years later, in August 1991, the ECS was split into two independent departments - taking ES back to its original name (Department of Engineering Sciences) and establishing the Department of Computer Science (DCS). The new department took full responsibility of offering the BCS program, which was subsequently renamed "bachelor of science in computer science program".

In May 1995, twenty years after the institution of the pioneering, but now defunct, MEngg CS program, the BOR approved the institution of a new master of science in computer science (MSCS) program. Furthermore, in 2010, the BOR approved the institution of a doctor of philosophy in computer science (PhD CS) program. Both the BSCS and the graduate programs continue to attract some of the best students in UP Diliman.

As of the end of the seconds semester of AY 2009-2010, the BCS/BSCS program had produced a total of 1191 graduates, 224 with Latin honors: 161 ''cum laude'', 59 ''magna cum laude'' and 4 ''summa cum laude''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12088">'''Wastewater quality indicators''' are [[laboratory]] test [[methodology|methodologies]] to assess suitability of [[wastewater]] for disposal or re-use.  Tests selected and desired test results vary with the intended use or discharge location.  Tests measure physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the waste water.

==Physical characteristics==

===Temperature===
Aquatic organisms cannot survive outside of specific temperature ranges.  [[Irrigation]] runoff and [[water cooling]] of [[power station]]s may elevate temperatures above the acceptable range for some species. Elevated temperature can also cause an [[algae bloom]] which reduces oxygen levels. (''See'' [[thermal pollution]].) '''[[Temperature]]''' may be measured with a calibrated [[thermometer]].&lt;ref name="Franson"&gt;Franson, Mary Ann ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' 14th edition (1975) APHA, AWWA &amp; WPCF {{ISBN|0-87553-078-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|125-126}}

===Solids===
Solid material in wastewater may be dissolved, suspended, or settled.  '''[[Total dissolved solids]]''' or TDS (sometimes called filterable residue) is measured as the mass of residue remaining when a measured volume of [[filter (chemistry)|filtered]] water is [[evaporate]]d.  The mass of dried solids remaining on the filter is called '''[[total suspended solids]]''' (TSS) or nonfiltrable residue.  '''[[Settling#Settleable solids analysis|Settleable solids]]''' are measured as the visible volume accumulated at the bottom of an Imhoff cone after water has settled for one hour.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|89-98}} '''[[Turbidity]]''' is a measure of the light scattering ability of suspended matter in the water.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|131-137}} '''[[Salinity]]''' measures water [[density]] or [[conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] changes caused by dissolved materials.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|99-100}}

==Chemical characteristics==
Virtually any chemical may be found in water, but routine testing is commonly limited to a few [[chemical element]]s of unique significance.

===Hydrogen===
Water ionizes into [[hydronium]] (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O) [[cation]]s and [[hydroxyl]] (OH) [[anion]]s.  The concentration of ionized [[hydrogen]] (as protonated water) is expressed as '''[[pH]]'''.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|406-407}}

===Oxygen===
Most aquatic habitats are occupied by [[fish]] or other animals requiring certain minimum dissolved [[oxygen]] concentrations to survive.  '''[[Dissolved oxygen]]''' concentrations may be measured directly in wastewater, but the amount of oxygen potentially required by other chemicals in the wastewater is termed as oxygen demand.  Dissolved or suspended [[Redox|oxidizable]] organic material in wastewater will be used as a food source.  Finely divided material is readily available to microorganisms whose populations will increase to digest the amount of food available.  Digestion of this food requires oxygen, so the oxygen content of the water will ultimately be decreased by the amount required to digest the dissolved or suspended food.  Oxygen concentrations may fall below the minimum required by aquatic animals if the rate of oxygen utilization exceeds replacement by atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Charles R. &amp; Horne, Alexander J. ''Limnology'' (1983) McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-023651-8}} p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

Basically, the reaction for biochemical oxidation may be written as:

:Oxidizable material + bacteria + nutrient + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + oxidized [[Inorganic chemistry|inorganics]] such as NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

Oxygen consumption by reducing chemicals such as sulfides and nitrites is typified as follows:

:S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

:NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + ½ O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Since all natural waterways contain bacteria and nutrient, almost any waste compounds introduced into such waterways will initiate biochemical reactions (such as shown above).  Those biochemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the '''[[biochemical oxygen demand]]''' (BOD).

Oxidizable chemicals (such as reducing chemicals) introduced into a natural water will similarly initiate chemical reactions (such as shown above).  Those chemical reactions create what is measured in the laboratory as the '''[[chemical oxygen demand]]''' (COD).

Both the BOD and COD tests are a measure of the relative oxygen-depletion effect of a waste contaminant.  Both have been widely adopted as a measure of pollution effect. The BOD test measures the oxygen demand of [[biodegradation|biodegradable]] pollutants whereas the COD test measures the oxygen demand of biodegradable pollutants plus the oxygen demand of non-biodegradable oxidizable pollutants.

The so-called 5-day BOD measures the amount of oxygen consumed by biochemical oxidation of waste contaminants in a 5-day period. The total amount of oxygen consumed when the biochemical reaction is allowed to proceed to completion is called the Ultimate BOD. Because the Ultimate BOD is so time consuming, the 5-day BOD has been almost universally adopted as a measure of relative pollution effect.

There are also many different COD tests of which the 4-hour COD is probably the most common.

There is no generalized correlation between the 5-day BOD and the ultimate BOD. Similarly there is no generalized correlation between BOD and COD. It is possible to develop such correlations for specific waste contaminants in a specific wastewater stream but such correlations cannot be generalized for use with any other waste contaminants or wastewater streams. This is because the composition of any wastewater stream is different. As an example an effluent consisting of a solution of simple [[sugar]]s that might discharge from a [[confectionery]] factory is likely to have organic components that degrade very quickly. In such a case, the 5 day BOD and the ultimate BOD would be very similar since there would be very little organic material left after 5 days. However a final effluent of a sewage treatment works serving a large industrialised area might have a discharge where the ultimate BOD was much greater than the 5 day BOD because much of the easily degraded material would have been removed in the sewage treatment process and many industrial processes discharge difficult to degrade organic molecules.

The laboratory test procedures for the determining the above oxygen demands are detailed in many standard texts. American versions include the "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater."&lt;ref&gt;Clescerl, Leonore S.(Editor), Greenberg, Arnold E.(Editor), Eaton, Andrew D. (Editor). ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' (20th ed.) American Public Health Association, Washington, DC. {{ISBN|0-87553-235-7}}. This publication is also available on CD-ROM and [http://www.standardmethods.org/ online] by subscription.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nitrogen===
[[Nitrogen]] is an important nutrient for plant and animal growth.  Atmospheric nitrogen is less biologically available than dissolved nitrogen in the form of [[ammonia]] and [[nitrate]]s.  Availability of dissolved nitrogen may contribute to [[algal bloom]]s.  Ammonia and organic forms of nitrogen are often measured as '''[[Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen]]''', and analysis for inorganic forms of nitrogen may be performed for more accurate estimates of total nitrogen content.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|406-407}}

===Phosphates===
;Total Phosphorus and Phosphate, PO{{su|b=4|p=−3}}
Phosphates enter the water ways through both non-point sources and point sources. Non-point source (NPS) pollution refers to water pollution from diffuse sources. Nonpoint source pollution can be contrasted with point source pollution, where discharges occur to a body of water at a single location. The non-point sources of phosphates include: natural decomposition of rocks and minerals, storm water runoff, agricultural runoff, erosion and sedimentation, atmospheric deposition, and direct input by animals/wildlife; whereas: point sources may include: waste water treatment plants and permitted industrial discharges. In general, the non-point source pollution typically is significantly higher than the point sources of pollution. Therefore, the key to sound management is to limit the input from both point and non-point sources of phosphate. High concentration of phosphate in water bodies is an indication of pollution and largely responsible for [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCutheon et al., 1983{{Full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phosphates are not toxic to people or animals unless they are present in very high levels. Digestive problems could occur from extremely high levels of phosphate.

The following criteria for total phosphorus were recommended by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].
# No more than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/L for streams which do not empty into reservoirs,
# No more than 0.05&amp;nbsp;mg/L for streams discharging into reservoirs, and
# No more than 0.025&amp;nbsp;mg/L for reservoirs.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA (1984){{Full citation needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phosphorus''' is normally low (&lt; 1&amp;nbsp;mg/l) in clean potable water sources and usually not regulated;&lt;ref&gt;Nduka et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (1984){{Full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chlorine===
[[Chlorine]] has been widely used for [[bleach]]ing, as a [[disinfectant]], and for [[biofouling]] prevention in [[water cooling]] systems.  Remaining concentrations of oxidizing [[hypochlorous acid]] and [[hypochlorite]] ions may be measured as '''chlorine residual''' to estimate effectiveness of disinfection or to demonstrate safety for discharge to aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|309-315}}

==Biological characteristics==
Water may be tested by a '''[[bioassay]]''' comparing survival of an aquatic test species in the wastewater in comparison to water from some other source.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|685-689}} Water may also be evaluated to determine the approximate biological population of the wastewater.  [[Pathogen]]ic micro-organisms using water as a means of moving from one host to another may be present in [[sewage]].  '''[[Coliform index]]''' measures the population of an organism commonly found in the intestines of warm-blooded animals as an indicator of the possible presence of other intestinal pathogens.&lt;ref name="Franson"/&gt;{{rp|875-877}}

This article is about the role played by '''women in the military in the Americas''', particularly in the [[History of women in the United States|United States]] and [[History of women in Canada|Canada]] from the First World War to modern times.

==Brazil==

The first participation of a woman in combat occurred in 1823. Maria Quitéria de Jesus fought for the maintenance of the independence of Brazil, and is considered the first woman to enlist in a military unit.
However, it was not until 1943, during World War II, that women officially entered the Brazilian Army. They included 73 nurses, 67 of them registered nurses and six air transport specialists. They served in four different hospitals in the US Army.  All volunteered for the mission and were the first women to join the active service of the Brazilian armed forces. After the war, as well as the rest of the FEB, the nurses, most have been awarded, they won the official patent and licensed the active military service.

In 1992, the School of Army Administration (Salvador - BA) enrolled the first group of 49 women, by conducting tender. And in 1996, Maria Quitéria de Jesus, the Paladina of Independence, was recognized in the army ranks, as Patron of Table Complementary Brazilian Army officers. The Army established the Military Female Volunteer for Medical, Dental, Pharmaceutical, Veterinary and top-level Nurses (MFDV) in 1996. At that time, they entered the first class of 290 female volunteers to provide military service in healthcare. This merger took place in all twelve military regions of the country. 

In 1997 the Military Institute of Engineering—IME (Rio de Janeiro—RJ) enrolled the first group of 10 women students to be included in Table Military Engineers (QEM). In the same year the School of the Army Health—Essex (Rio de Janeiro RJ) enrolled and graduated the first group of medical officers, dentists, pharmaceutical, veterinary and top-level nurses in the framework of the Army Health.

In 1998, the Army established the Stage Technical Service for higher education professionals than healthcare. At that time, he entered the first class of 519 women lawyers, administrators of businesses, accountants, teachers, computer analysts, engineers, architects, journalists, and other areas of human and exact sciences, serving the needs of Official Temporary Technical (OTT) of Institution. In 2001 the Army Health School allowed the enrollment of women to participate in the public tender for the filling of vacancies in the Health Sergeant Course, which started to operate in 2002.

==Canada==

[[File:CWAC mechanic, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Private Lowry, [[Canadian Women's Army Corps|CWAC]], tightening up the springs on the front of her vehicle, Chelsea &amp; Cricklewood Garage, England, 7 July 1944.]]

During the First World War, over 2,300 women served overseas in the Canadian Army Medical Corps. Canadian women were also organized into possible uniformed home guard units, undertaking military training in [[paramilitary]] groups. During the Second World War, 5,000 women of the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps again served overseas, however they were not permitted to serve on combat warships or in combat teams. The Canadian Army Women's Corps was created during the Second World War, as was the Royal Canadian Air Force (Women's Division). As well, 45,000 women served as support staff in every theatre of the conflict, driving heavy equipment, rigging parachutes, and performing clerical work, telephone operation, laundry duties and cooking. Some 5,000 women performed similar occupations during Canada’s part in the [[Korean War]] of 1950–1953.

In 1965 the Canadian government decided to allow a maximum of 1,500 women to serve directly in all three branches of its armed forces, and the former "women's services" were disbanded. In 1970 the government created a set of rules for the armed forces designed to encourage equal opportunities. These included the standardization of enlistment criteria, equal pay and pensions, and allowing women to enroll in all aspects of the Canadian armed forces and making it possible for women to reach any rank. In 1974 the first woman, Major Wendy Clay, earned her pilot's wings in the newly integrated [[Canadian Forces]], and four years later the first woman qualified for the Canadian skydiving demonstration team, the Skyhawks.

Between 1979 and 1985 the role of women expanded further, with military colleges allowing women to enroll. 1981 saw the first female navigator and helicopter pilot, and in 1982 laws were passed ending all discrimination in employment, and combat related roles in the Canadian armed forces were opened for women, with no restrictions in place, with the exception of the submarine service. In 1986 further laws were created to the same effect. The following years saw Canada’s first female infantry soldier, first female gunner, and a female [[Brigadier-General]].

In 1990 the Ministers Advisory Board on Women in the Canadian Forces was created, and in 1994 Wendy Clay was promoted to [[Major-General]]. In 2000 Major [[Micky Colton]] became the first female to log 5,000 flying hours in a [[C-130 Hercules]]. Women were permitted to serve on board Canadian submarines in 2002 with the acquisition of the [[Upholder/Victoria-class submarine|''Victoria''-class submarine]]. Master Seaman Colleen Beattie became the first female submariner in 2003.

Canadian women have also become clearance divers, and commanded large infantry units and Canadian warships.

On May 17, 2006 [[Captain (Canadian army and air force)|Captain]] [[Nichola Goddard]] became the first Canadian woman killed in combat during operations in [[Afghanistan]].

==United States==
[[File:080930-110605 - SGT Lisa Morales awaits turn.jpg|thumb|Two female U.S. Army soldiers in September 2008.]]
One of the first American woman soldiers was [[Deborah Sampson]] of [[Massachusetts]]. She enlisted as a [[Continental Army]] soldier under the name of "Robert Shurtliff". She served for three years in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and was wounded twice; she cut a musket ball out of her own thigh so no doctor would find out she was a woman. Finally, at the end of the hostilities her secret was discovered—even so, [[George Washington]] gave her an [[honorable discharge]]. She later lectured on her experiences and became a champion of [[women's rights]]. Another female soldier in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] was  [[Anna Maria Lane]] of [[Virginia]], who enlisted with her husband in 1776 and fought in several battles, including the [[Battle of Germantown]]. &lt;ref&gt;T [https://books.google.com/books?id=drE50WEN1WUC&amp;q=Anna+Maria+Lane#v=snippet&amp;q=Anna%20Maria%20Lane&amp;f=false endrich, Lisa Frank, An Encyclopedia of American Women at War: From the Home Front to the Battlefields, Volume 1 ABC-CLIO, 2013, p 350-51]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treadway, Sandra Gioia. “Anna Maria Lane: An Uncommon Soldier of the American Revolution.” Virginia Cavalcade 37, no. 3 (1988): 134–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]], about 250 women have been found to have enlisted, counting both sides, and specialists believe that the total is higher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.mtsu.edu/tps/Women_and_the_Civil_War.pdf Women and the Civil War], Middle Tennessee State U and Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeAnne Blanton. [https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1993/spring/women-in-the-civil-war-1.html Women Soldiers of the Civil War]. ''Prologue Magazine'' 25:1, Spring 1993&lt;/ref&gt; It was not generally a crime to for a woman to enlist, but it was considered improper and women only signed up claiming to be men.  For example, [[Sarah Rosetta Wakeman]] enlisted under the alias of Private Lyons Wakeman. She served in the 153rd Regiment, New York State Volunteers. Her complete letters describing her experiences as a female soldier in the Union Army are reproduced in the book, ''An Uncommon Soldier: The Civil War Letters of Sarah Rosetta Wakeman, alias Pvt. Lyons Wakeman, 153rd Regiment, New York State Volunteers, 1862–1864''.&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, Sarah Rosetta, and Lauren M. Cook. 1994.

A letter written by Annie Oakley to President [[William McKinley]] on April 5, 1898 may represent the earliest documentary proof of a political move towards recognizing a woman's right to serve in the United States military. [[Annie Oakley]], sharpshooter and star in the [[Buffalo Bill]] Show, wrote a letter to President William McKinley on April 5, 1898 "offering the government the services of a company of 50 'lady sharpshooters' who would provide their own arms and ammunition should war break out with Spain."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/recover/example-02.html Letter to President William McKinley from Annie Oakley]. The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (NARA). Retrieved January 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Oakley's offer was not accepted for the [[Spanish–American War]].

In World War I, the first American women enlisted into the regular armed forces were 13,000 women admitted into active duty in the Navy and Marines and a much smaller number admitted into the Coast Guard. The Yeoman (F) recruits and women Marines primarily served in clerical positions. They received the same benefits and responsibilities as men, including identical pay (US$28.75 per month), and were treated as veterans after the war. These women were quickly demobilized when hostilities ceased, and aside from the Nurse Corps the soldiery became once again exclusively male.

[[Women's Army Corps|The Woman's Army Auxiliary Corps]] was established in the United States in 1942. However, political pressures stalled attempts to create more roles for women in the American Armed Forces. Women saw combat during [[World War II]], first as nurses in the [[Pearl Harbor]] attacks on December 7, 1941. The [[WAVES|Woman's Naval Reserve]] and [[United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve|Marine Corps Women’s Reserve]] were also created during this conflict. In July 1943 a bill was signed removing 'auxiliary' from the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, making it an official part of the regular army. In 1944 WACs arrived in the Pacific and landed in Normandy on [[D-Day]]. During the war, 67 Army nurses and 16 [[United States Navy Nurse Corps|Navy nurses]] were captured and spent three years as Japanese prisoners of war. There were 350,000 American women who served during World War Two and 16 were killed in action; in total, they gained over 1,500 medals, citations and commendations.

[[Virginia Hall]], serving with the Office of Strategic Services, received the second-highest US combat award, the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], for action behind enemy lines in France. Hall, who had one artificial leg, landed clandestinely in occupied territory aboard a British [[Motor Torpedo Boat]].

After World War Two, demobilization led to the vast majority of serving women being returned to civilian life. Law 625, [[Women's Armed Services Integration Act|The Women's Armed Services Act]] of 1948, was signed by [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]], allowing women to serve in the armed forces in fully integrated units during peace time, with only the WAC remaining a separate female unit. During the [[Korean War]] of 1950–1953 many women served in the [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]]s, with women serving in Korea numbering 120,000 during the conflict.
[[File:A1C Gonzalez, 377th SFS - Kirtland AFB.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Airman 1st Class, Ashley Gonzalez of the United States Air force.]]
Records regarding American women serving in the [[Vietnam War]] are vague. However, it is recorded that 600 women served in the country as part of the Air Force, along with 500 members of the WAC, and over 6,000 medical personnel and support staff.

The [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Corps]] began accepting female missile technicians in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redstone.army.mil/history/women_chron/chron1970s.html |title=The Women of Redstone Arsenal |publisher=United States Army |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and female crewmembers and officers were accepted into [[Field Artillery Branch (United States)|Field Artillery]] missile units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Busse |first=Charlane |date=July 1978 |title=First women join Pershing training |journal=[[Field Artillery (magazine)|Field Artillery Journal]] |publisher=[[United States Army Field Artillery School]] |page=40 |url=http://sill-www.army.mil/famag/1978/JUL_AUG_1978/JUL_AUG_1978_PAGES_40_43.pdf |accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=November 1978 |title=The Journal interviews: 1LT Elizabeth A.

In 1974, the first six women aviators earned their wings as [[United States Navy|Navy]] pilots: [[Jane Skiles O'Dea]], [[Barbara Allen Rainey]], [[Rosemary Bryant Mariner]], [[Judith Neuffer|Judith Ann Neuffer]], Ana Marie Fuqua, and Joellen Drag Oslund.

America’s involvement in [[Grenada]] in 1983 saw over 200 women serving; however, none of these took part in direct combat. Some women, such as Lt Col [[Eileen Collins]] or Lt Celeste Hayes, flew transport aircraft carrying wounded or assault teams, however they were not deemed to have been in direct combat. Several hundred women took part in operations in [[Panama]] in 1989, in non-combat roles.

On December 20, 1989, Capt Linda L. Bray, 29, became the first woman to command American soldiers in battle, during the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]]. She was assigned to lead a force of 30 men and women MPs to capture a kennel holding guard dogs that was defended by elements of the Panamanian Defense force. From a command center about a half-mile from the kennel she ordered her troops to fire warning shots. The Panamanians returned fire until threatened by artillery attack, fleeing into nearby woods. Bray advanced to the kennel to try to stop them, using the cover of a ditch to reach the building. No enemy dead were found, but a cache of weapons was recovered.

The 1991 [[Gulf War]] brought greater media attention to the role of women in the American armed forces. A senior woman pilot at the time, Colonel Kelly Hamilton, commented that "[t]he conflict was an awakening for the people in the US. They suddenly realised there were a lot of women in the military." Over 40,000 women served in almost every role the armed forces had to offer. They were not permitted to participate in deliberate ground engagements. Many came under fire, however, and there are many reports of women engaging enemy forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://userpages.aug.com/captbarb/femvetsds.html Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm: Women Were There!]&lt;/ref&gt; One example is that of the USS Mount HOOD, AE-29, Pacific Fleet ammunitions carrier in Battle Group Bravo. The Mt. Hood's sister ship, which was all male, was grounded after hitting a mine. The Mt. Hood, regardless of having at least 32 women on board, the first women to board that class of vessel in the USN, filled in. The women aboard the USS Mt. Hood, AE-29, may be the enlisted Navy's very first CONGRESSIONALLY RECOGNIZED females ordered to combat in a Congressionally declared war. That is not to say that they were the first females in combat because, as above illustrates, women have fought the front lines, whether they were afforded official Congressional recognition for their service or not. At any rate, this small ship tackled her duties and from the women leaders aboard came the first African-American female Admiral in the history of the United States Navy, Admiral and second in command of the United States Navy as Vice Chief of Naval Operations: Admiral Michelle Howard.&lt;ref&gt;MM3 Dorothy D. Meindok, Esq./ USS Mount Hood AE-29 sailor&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, women can serve on American combat ships, including in command roles, and on submarines.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/29/us-navy-submarines-women US navy lifts ban on women submariners (''The Guardian'' (UK), 29 April 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; They are not permitted to participate in special forces programs such as [[Navy SEALs]]. Women enlisted soldiers are barred from serving in Infantry, Special Forces, however female enlisted members and officers can hold staff positions in every branch of the Army except infantry and armor. Women can however serve on the staffs of infantry and armor units at Division level and above, and be members of Special Operations Forces. Women can fly military aircraft and make up 2% of all pilots in the U.S. military. Although Army regulations ban women from infantry assignments, some females are detailed to accompany male infantry units to handle searches of Iraqi women.

[[File:JessicaLynch02.jpeg|left|thumb|[[Jessica Lynch]] after being rescued in 2003]]
The case ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'', in which the Supreme Court ordered that the Virginia Military Institute allow women to register as cadets, gave women soldiers a weapon against laws which (quoting J. Ruth Bader Ginsburg) “[deny] to women, simply because they are women, full citizenship stature—equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society.”

During [[Battle of Nasiriyah]] in 2003, American soldiers [[Shoshana Johnson]], the first African-American and first Hispanic female prisoner of war, and [[Jessica Lynch]] were captured while serving in Iraq. In the same action, [[Lori Piestewa]], a U.S. soldier, died after driving her Humvee through enemy fire in an attempt to escape an ambush, earning a Purple Heart. She had just rescued Jessica Lynch, whose vehicle had crashed.

Also in 2003, Major [[Kim Campbell (pilot)|Kim Campbell]] was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for landing her combat damaged [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] with no hydraulic control and only one functional engine after being struck by hostile fire over [[Baghdad]].

In a recent scandal, U.S Army Reservists [[Lynndie England]] and [[Sabrina Harman]] were convicted by [[court martial]] of [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|cruelty and maltreatment of prisoners]] at [[Abu Ghraib prison]].

[[File:Leigh Ann Hester medal.jpg|thumb|upright|SGT [[Leigh Ann Hester]], awarded the [[Silver Star]] for direct combat]]
SGT Leigh Ann Hester became the first woman to receive the Silver Star, the third-highest US decoration for valor, for direct participation in combat. Female medical personnel had been awarded the same medal, but not for actual combat. She was a team leader of [[Raven 42]], a [[Military Police]] squad that broke up an ambush roughly three to four times its strength. Specialist Ashley Pullen received the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]]. The squad leader, SSG Timothy Nein, had originally received the Silver Star, but his award was later upgraded to the Distinguished Service Cross. SGT Jason Mike, the unit's medic, also received the Silver Star.
