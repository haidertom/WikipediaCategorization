'''Adaptive management''' ('''AM'''), also known as '''adaptive resource management''' ('''ARM''') or '''adaptive environmental assessment and management''' ('''AEAM'''), is a structured, [[iteration|iterative]] process of robust [[decision making]] in the face of [[uncertainty]], with an aim to reducing uncertainty over time via [[system monitoring]]. In this way, decision making simultaneously meets one or more [[resource management]] objectives and, either passively or actively, accrues information needed to improve future management. Adaptive management is a tool which should be used not only to change a system, but also to learn about the system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adaptive Environmental Assessment and Management|last=Holling|first=C.S.|publisher=John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons|year=1978|isbn=9781932846072|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because adaptive management is based on a learning process, it improves long-run management outcomes. The challenge in using the adaptive management approach lies in finding the correct balance between gaining knowledge to improve management in the future and achieving the best short-term outcome based on current knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EMxPZu99B_MC#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false|title=Adaptive Environmental Management: A Practitioner's Guide|last=Allan|first=Catherine|last2=Stankey|first2=George Henry|date=2009-06-05|publisher=Springer Science &amp;amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402096327|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has more recently been employed in implementing [[international development]] programs.

==Objectives==
There are a number of scientific and social processes which are vital components of adaptive management, including:
* Management is linked to appropriate temporal and spatial scales
* Management retains a focus on [[statistical power]] and controls
* Use of computer models to build synthesis and an embodied ecological consensus
* Use of embodied ecological consensus to evaluate strategic alternatives
* Communication of alternatives to political arena for negotiation of a selection

The achievement of these objectives requires an open management process which seeks to include past, present and future [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. Adaptive management needs to at least maintain [[Glasnost|political openness]], but usually aims to create it. Adaptive management must therefore be a [[scientific]] and social process. It must focus on the development of new [[institutions]] and institutional strategies in balance with [[scientific hypothesis]] and experimental frameworks (resilliance.org).

Adaptive management can proceed as either passive or active adaptive management, depending on how learning takes place. Passive adaptive management values learning only insofar as it improves decision outcomes (i.e. passively), as measured by the specified utility function. In contrast, active adaptive management explicitly incorporates learning as part of the objective function, and hence, decisions which improve learning are valued over those which do not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adaptive management of renewable resources|last=1944-|first=Walters, Carl J.|date=1986-01-01|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0029479704|oclc=13184654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, as new knowledge is gained, the models are updated and optimal management strategies are derived accordingly. Thus, while learning occurs in both cases, it is treated differently. Often, deriving actively adaptive policies is technically very difficult, which prevents it being more commonly applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carey|first=Gemma|last2=Crammond|first2=Brad|last3=Malbon|first3=Eleanor|last4=Carey|first4=Nic|date=2015-09-18|title=Adaptive Policies for Reducing Inequalities in the Social Determinants of Health|journal=International Journal of Health Policy and Management|volume=4|issue=11|pages=763–767|doi=10.15171/ijhpm.2015.170|issn=2322-5939|pmc=4629702|pmid=26673337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Key features of both passive and active adaptive management are:
*Iterative decision-making (evaluating results and adjusting actions on the basis of what has been learned)
*[[Feedback]] between monitoring and decisions (learning)
*Explicit characterization of system uncertainty through multi-model inference
*[[Bayesian inference]]
*Embracing [[risk]] and uncertainty as a way of building understanding

However, a number of process failures related to information feedback can prevent effective adaptive management decision making:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L|first=Elzinga, Caryl|last2=W|first2=Salzer, Daniel|last3=W|first3=Willoughby, John|date=1998-01-01|title=Measuring &amp; Monitering Plant Populations|journal=U.s. Bureau of Land Management Papers|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usblmpub/17/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[data collection]] is never completely implemented
* data are collected but not analyzed
* [[data analysis|data are analyzed]] but results are inconclusive
* data are analyzed and are interesting, but are not presented to decision makers
* data are analyzed and presented, but are not used for decision-making because of internal or external factors

==History==
The use of adaptive management techniques can be traced back to peoples from ancient civilisations. For example, the [[Yap]] people of Micronesia have been using adaptive management techniques to sustain high [[population density|population densities]] in the face of resource scarcity for thousands of years (Falanruw 1984). In using these techniques, the Yap people have altered their environment creating, for example, coastal [[mangrove]] depressions and [[seagrass]] meadows to support fishing and termite resistant wood (Stankey and Shinder 1997).

The origin of the adaptive management concept can be traced back to ideas of [[scientific management]] pioneered by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] in the early 1900s (Haber 1964). While the term "adaptive management" evolved in natural resource management workshops through decision makers, managers and scientists focussing on building simulation models to uncover key assumptions and uncertainties (Bormann ''et al.'' 1999)&lt;!-- ### This sentence is incomplete. Managagers and sci. did what? --&gt;

Two ecologists at The [[University of British Columbia]], [[C. S. Holling|C.S. Holling]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and C.J Walters&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; further developed the adaptive management approach as they distinguished between passive and active adaptive management practice. [[Kai Lee]], notable Princeton physicist, expanded upon the approach in the late 1970s and early 1980s while pursuing a post-doctorate degree at UC [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. The approach was further developed at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], while C.S. Holling was director of the Institute. In 1992, Hilbourne described three learning models for federal land managers, around which adaptive management approaches could be developed, these are reactive, passive and active.

Adaptive management has probably been most frequently applied in Yap, [[Australia]] and [[North America]], initially applied in [[fishery]] management, but received more broad application in the 1990s and 2000s. One of the most successful applications of adaptive management has been in the area of waterfowl harvest management in North America, most notably for the [[mallard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nichols|first=James D.|last2=Johnson|first2=Fred A.|last3=Williams|first3=Byron K.|last4=Boomer|first4=G. Scott|date=2015-06-01|title=On formally integrating science and policy: walking the walk|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=52|issue=3|pages=539–543|doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12406|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptive management in a conservation project and program context can trace its roots back to at least the early 1990s, with the establishment of the Biodiversity Support Program (BSP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwildlife.org/bsp/index.html Biodiversity Support Program]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1989.  BSP was a [http://www.usaid.gov/ USAID]-funded consortium of WWF&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwildlife.org/ WWF]&lt;/ref&gt; The Nature Conservancy (TNC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnc.org/ The Nature Conservancy]&lt;/ref&gt; and World Resources Institute (WRI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wri.org/ World Resources Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Its Analysis and Adaptive Management Program sought to understand the conditions under which certain conservation strategies were most effective and to identify lessons learned across conservation projects.  When BSP ended in 2001, TNC and Foundations of Success&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fosonline.org/ Foundations of Success]&lt;/ref&gt; (FOS, a non-profit which grew out of BSP) continued to actively work in promoting adaptive management for conservation projects and programs.  The approaches used included Conservation by Design&lt;ref&gt;[http://conserveonline.org/workspaces/cbdgateway/ Conservation by Design]&lt;/ref&gt; (TNC) and Measures of Success&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandpress.org/ip/books/book/islandpress/M/bo3559851.html Measures of Success]&lt;/ref&gt; (FOS).

In 2004, the Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationmeasures.org/ Conservation Measures Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt; – which includes several former BSP members – developed a common set of standards and guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.conservationmeasures.org/initiatives/standards-for-project-management/ | title=Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; for applying adaptive management to conservation projects and programs.

==Use in environmental practices==
Applying adaptive management in a conservation project or program involves the integration of project/program design, management, and monitoring to systematically test assumptions in order to adapt and learn. The three components of adaptive management in environmental practice are:

*''Testing assumptions'' is about systematically trying different actions to achieve a desired outcome. It is not, however, a random trial-and-error process.  Rather, it involves using knowledge about the specific site to pick the best known strategy, laying out the assumptions behind how that strategy will work, and then collecting monitoring data to determine if the assumptions hold true.
*''Adaptation'' involves changing assumptions and interventions to respond to new or different information obtained through monitoring and project experience.
*''Learning'' is about explicitly documenting a team's planning and implementation processes and its successes and failures for internal learning as well as learning across the conservation community.  This learning enables conservation practitioners to design and manage projects better and avoid some of the perils others have encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stankey|first=George H.|last2=Clark|first2=Roger N.|last3=Bormann|first3=Bernard T.|last4=Stankey|first4=George H.|last5=Clark|first5=Roger N.|last6=Bormann|first6=Bernard T.|title=Adaptive management of natural resources: theory, concepts, and management institutions.|url=https://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/20657/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning about a managed system is only useful in cases where management decisions are repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rout|first=Tracy M.|last2=Hauser|first2=Cindy E.|last3=Possingham|first3=Hugh P.|date=2009-03-01|title=Optimal adaptive management for the translocation of a threatened species|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=515–526|doi=10.1890/07-1989.1|issn=1939-5582|pmid=19323207|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:181588/UQ181588_OA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to environmental projects and programs==
[[Image:CMP Cycle - 2008-02-20.jpg|thumb|Figure 1: CMP Adaptive Management Cycle]]

''Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationmeasures.org/initiatives/standards-for-project-management ''Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation'']&lt;/ref&gt; lays out five main steps to an adaptive management project cycle (see Figure 1).  The ''Open Standards'' represent a compilation and adaptation of best practices and guidelines across several fields and across several organizations within the conservation community.  Since the release of the initial ''Open Standards'' (updated in 2007 and 2013), thousands of project teams from conservation organizations (e.g., TNC, Rare, and WWF), local conservation groups, and donors alike have begun applying these ''Open Standards'' to their work.  In addition, several CMP members have developed training materials and courses to help apply the Standards.

Some recent write-ups of adaptive management in conservation include:  wildlife protection (SWAP, 2008), forests ecosystem protection (CMER, 2010), coastal protection and restoration (LACPR, 2009), natural resource management (water, land and soil), species conservation especially, fish conservation from [[overfishing]] (FOS, 2007) and [[climate change]] (DFG, 2010). In addition, some other examples follow:
 
*In 2006–2007, FOS worked with The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) to develop an evaluation system help NFWF gauge impact across the various coral reef habitat and species conservation projects;
*In 2007, FOS worked with the Ocean Conservancy (OC) to evaluate the effectiveness of this Scorecard in helping to end overfishing in domestic fisheries.
*Between 1999–2004, FOS worked for WWF's Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy (AREAS) Program to ensure that Asian elephants and rhinos thrive in secure habitats within their historical range and in harmony with people.
*The Department of Fish and Game (DFG) is developing and implementing adaptation strategies to help protect, restore and manage fish and wildlife, with the understanding that some level of climate change will occur and that it will have profound effects on ecosystems in the United States.
*The Adaptive Management program was created by CMR to provide science-based recommendations and technical information to assist the Forest Practices Board. In April 2010, the Forest Practices Adaptive Management Annual Science Conference was held in Washington.
*In 2009, The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration (LACPR) Technical Report has been developed by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE) according to adaptive management process.
*Since 2009, the Kenya Wildlife Service has been managing its marine protected areas using adaptive management in an ongoing process of learning through the  Science for Active Management (SAM)&lt;ref&gt;[http://sam4wio.weebly.com Science for Active Management]&lt;/ref&gt; Program.

==In international development==

The concept of adaptive management is not restricted to natural resources or ecosystem management, as similar concepts have been applied to [[international development]] programming.&lt;ref&gt;"2 Adaptive Management Theories, Frameworks, and Practices." National Research Council. 2004. Adaptive Management for Water Resources Project Planning.  Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rondinell, D. A. (1993) Development Projects as Policy Experiments: an adaptive approach to development administration, 2nd ed, Routledge, London and New York&lt;/ref&gt; This has often been a recognition to the "wicked" nature of many development challenges and the limits of traditional planning processes.&lt;ref&gt;Webber, M. and Rittel, H. (1973), "Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning", Policy Sciences, vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 155-169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramalingam, B., Laric, M. and Primrose, J. (2014) 'From Best Practice to Best Fit: Understanding and Navigating Wicked Problems in International Development'. Working Paper. London: ODI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Head, B. and Alford, J. (2008) "Wicked Problems: The Implications for Public Management", 12th Annual Conference International Research Society for Public Management, Vol. Panel on Public Management in Practice, 26–28 March 2008, Brisbane.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the principal changes facing international development organizations is the need to be more flexible, adaptable and focused on learning.&lt;ref&gt;S. Smith and A. Young, "Adapting to change: becoming a learning organization as a relief and development agency," in IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, vol. 52, no. 4, pp. 329-345, Dec. 2009. {{doi|10.1109/TPC.2009.2034240}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in international development approaches such as Doing Development Differently, Politically Informed Programming and Problem Driven Iterative Adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, M., Pritchett, L. and Woolcock, M. (2015) Doing problem driven work. Working Paper 30. Cambridge, MA: Center for International Development at [[Harvard University]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, D. and Unsworth, S.

(2014) Problem-driven political economy analysis: The World Bank's experience. Washington DC: [[World Bank]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent example of the use of adaptive management by international development donors is the planned Global Learning for Adaptive Management (GLAM) programme to support adaptive management in [[Department for International Development]] and [[USAID]]. The program is establishing a centre for learning about adaptive management to support the utilization and accessibility of adaptive management.&lt;ref&gt;Funds for NGOs.

Retrieved April 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of tools used to operationalize adaptive management in programs, such as [[learning agenda]]s.

Collaborating, learning and adapting (CLA) is a concept related to the operationalizing of adaptive management in international development that describes a specific way of designing, implementing, adapting and evaluating programs.&lt;ref&gt;Altschuld, J. W., &amp; Watkins, R. (2015). Needs assessment: trends and a view toward the future. New Directions for Evaluation, Number 144.

Becoming a knowledge-sharing organization: a handbook for scaling up solutions through knowledge capturing and sharing. Washington, D.C.: [[World Bank Group]]. http://hdl.handle.net/10986/25320&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} CLA involves three concepts:
#collaborating intentionally with stakeholders to share knowledge and reduce duplication of effort,
#learning systematically by drawing on evidence from a variety of sources and taking the time to reflect on implementation, and
#adapting strategically based on applied learning. CLA practices have tangible benefits; for instance, a recent study recently found that companies "which apply more data-driven and adaptive leadership practices perform better" when examined against those which focus less on those practices.&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, P., Tse, M., Khan, Z. and Rao-Nicholson, R.

CLA integrates three closely connected concepts within the organizational theory literature: namely collaborating, learning and adapting. There is evidence of the benefits of collaborating internally within an organization and externally with organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://usaidlearninglab.org/library/literature-review-evidence-base-collaborating,-learning,-and-adapting|title=Literature review of the evidence base for collaborating, learning, and adapting|last=Lab|first=Learning|date=2016-08-11|work=USAID Learning Lab|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the production and transmission of knowledge—both [[explicit knowledge]] and [[tacit knowledge]]—occurs through collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;For example: Polanyi, Michael (1966), The tacit dimension. Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence for the importance of collaboration among individuals and groups for innovation, knowledge production, and diffusion—for example, the benefits of staff interacting with one another and transmitting knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Kip, and Schaefer, Alan (2014).

==Use in other practices as a tool for sustainability==
Adaptive management as a systematic process for improving environmental management policies and practices is the traditional application however, the adaptive management framework can also be applied to other sectors seeking [[sustainability]] solutions such as business and community development. Adaptive management as a strategy emphasizes the need to change with the environment and to learn from doing. Adaptive management applied to ecosystems makes overt sense when considering ever changing environmental conditions.  The flexibility and constant learning of an adaptive management approach is also a logical application for organizations seeking sustainability methodologies.
Businesses pursuing sustainability strategies would employ an adaptive management framework to ensure that the organization is prepared for the unexpected and geared for change. By applying an adaptive management approach the business begins to function as an integrated system adjusting and learning from a multi-faceted network of influences not just environmental but also, economic and social (Dunphy, Griffths, &amp; Benn, 2007). The goal of any sustainable organization guided by adaptive management principals must be to engage in active learning to direct change towards sustainability (Verine, 2008). This "learning to manage by managing to learn" (Bormann BT, 1993) will be at the core of a sustainable business strategy.

Sustainable community development requires recognition of the relationship between environment, economics and social instruments within the community. An adaptive management approach to creating sustainable community policy and practice also emphasizes the connection and confluence of those elements. Looking into the cultural mechanisms which contribute to a community value system often highlights the  parallel to adaptive management practices, "with [an] emphasis on feedback learning, and its treatment of uncertainty and unpredictability" (Berkes, Colding, &amp; Folke, 2000). Often this is the result of indigenous knowledge and historical decisions of societies deeply rooted in ecological practices (Berkes, Colding, &amp; Folke, 2000).  By applying an adaptive management approach to community development the resulting systems can develop built in sustainable practice as  explained by the Environmental Advisory Council (2002), "active adaptive management views policy as a set of experiments designed to reveal processes that build or sustain resilience. It requires, and facilitates, a social context with flexible and open institutions and multi-level governance systems that allow for learning and increase adaptive capacity without foreclosing future development options" (p.&amp;nbsp;1121).

In an ever-changing world, adaptive management appeals to many practices seeking sustainable solutions by offering a framework for decision making that proposes to support a sustainable future which, "conserves and nurtures the diversity—of species, of human opportunity, of learning institutions and of economic options"(The Environmental Advisory Council, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;1121).

== Effectiveness ==
It is difficult to test the effectiveness of adaptive management in comparison to other management approaches. One challenge is that once a system is managed using one approach it is difficult to determine how another approach would have performed in exactly the same situation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Ellner|first2=Stephen P.|date=2016-07-01|title=Human judgment vs. quantitative models for the management of ecological resources|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1553–1565|doi=10.1890/15-1295|pmid=27755756|issn=1939-5582}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study tested the effectiveness of formal passive adaptive management in comparison to human intuition by having natural resource management students make decisions about how to harvest a hypothetical fish population in an online computer game. The students on average performed poorly in comparison to the computer programs implementing passive adaptive management.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://psmag.com/sometimes-even-bad-models-make-better-decisions-than-people-4956bade3990#.cnenr5clc|title=Sometimes, Even Bad Models Make Better Decisions Than People|last=Standard|first=Pacific|date=2016-03-11|newspaper=Pacific Standard|access-date=2016-12-22}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{BibleHistory}}
The '''Anchor Bible project''', consisting of a commentary series, Bible dictionary, and reference library, is a [[scholarly]] and [[Commerce|commercial]] co-venture begun in 1956, when individual volumes in the [[List of biblical commentaries|commentary]] series began production. Having initiated a new era of cooperation among scholars in biblical research, over 1,000 scholars—representing [[Jewish]], [[Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Protestant]], [[Muslim]], [[secular]], and other traditions—have now contributed to the project. Their works offer discussions that reflect a range of viewpoints across a wide [[theological]] spectrum. The Anchor Bible project continues to produce volumes that keep readers current on recent scholarship and are grounded in analysis. The works bring advances in science and technology to bear on biblical materials, making [[historical criticism|historical]] and [[textual criticism|linguistic knowledge]] related to the interpretation of the biblical record available to experts and students alike. As of 2005, more than 120 volumes had been published, each edited by [[David Noel Freedman]], General Editor and published by Doubleday (part of Random House, Inc.), Freedman died in 2008. Since then [[John J. Collins]] has served as the General Editor. In 2007, [[Yale University Press]] purchased the '''Anchor Bible Series'''. Yale now publishes backlist titles and new titles as the '''Anchor Yale Bible Series'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.yupnet.org/2007/09/25/breaking-news-y/ "Yale University Press Acquires Anchor Bible Series from Doubleday"], Yale University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/SeriesPage.asp?Series=143 "The Anchor Yale Bible Series"], Yale University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Anchor Bible Commentary Series''==
The ''Anchor Bible Commentary Series'', created under the guidance of [[William Foxwell Albright]] (1891–1971), comprises a translation and [[exegesis]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[New Testament]] and the Intertestamental Books (the [[Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Deuterocanon]]/the Protestant [[Apocrypha]]; not the books called by Catholics and Orthodox "Apocrypha", which are widely called by Protestants "[[Pseudepigrapha]]"). For each biblical book, the series includes an original translation (with annotations, including alternative translations) of ancient texts, using modern knowledge of the ancient languages; overviews of the historical, critical, and literary evolution of the text; an outline of major themes and topics; a verse-by-verse commentary; treatment of competing scholarly theories; historical background; and photographs, illustrations, and maps of artifacts and places associated with biblical figures and sites. Lengthy or complex biblical books are covered in more than one volume.

A work in progress, as of 2006, the series has produced over 80 volumes, some of which are updates of earlier works. The series is 99% complete; the second half of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] was released in early December 2006, and the remaining volumes are in production. Others such as II Chronicles and Revelation are under contract.

==''Anchor Bible Dictionary''==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[New Testament]] --&gt;
[[File:Anchor Bible Dictionary.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The ABD]]
The ''Anchor Bible Dictionary'' contains more than 6,000 entries from 800 international scholars. It has illustrations and line-art throughout, and is also available for download from [[Logos Bible Software]] or [[Accordance]] Bible Software. The "Dictionary" includes articles on the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], early Jewish-Christian relations, the historical Jesus, sociological and literary methods of biblical criticism, feminist hermeneutics, and numerous entries on archaeological sites, as well as bibliographies with citations listed individually at the end of each article.

==''Anchor Bible Reference Library''==

The ''Anchor Bible Reference Library'' is an open-ended series composed of more than thirty separate volumes with information about anthropology, archaeology, ecology, geography, history, languages, literature, philosophy, religions, and theology, among others.

==Works in the ''Anchor Yale Bible commentary series''==

Works in the ''Anchor Yale Bible commentary series'' include:

The '''Centre of Planning and Economic Research''' (KEPE) was established in 1959 as a research unit, under the title "Centre for Economic Research", to study the challenges faced by the [[Greek economy]] and encourage economic research in Greece and further cooperation with other scientific institutions.

In 1964, KEPE acquired its present name and organizational structure along with the additional charges of preparing [[development plans]], analyzing contemporary developments in the Greek economy, engaging in short and medium-term forecasts, formulating proposals for development policies and training young economists in the fields of planning and economic development.

Today, KEPE is a leading economics [[research institute]] in Greece. It focuses on applied research projects concerning the Greek economy, and provides expert advice to the Greek government on economic and social policy issues.

KEPE is governed by a board of directors appointed by the Minister for Development and Competitiveness. 
Research Fellows at KEPE concentrate on four areas of empirical research: (a) [[macroeconomic]] analysis and projections, (b) [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] and [[monetary policy]], (c) human resources and social policies, and (d) [[sectoral analysis]] and policy.

The Centre's research output includes publications in the following series:
*Studies, i.e., monographs which investigate specific economic issues through the application of modern analytical methods.
*Reports, i.e., works which analyse in a systematic manner sectoral, regional, or national economic issues.
*Discussion Papers, i.e., papers on ongoing research projects.
*Research collaborations, i.e., research projects prepared in cooperation with other research institutes.
*A four-monthly review, entitled Greek Economic Outlook.
*A monthly review, entitled Greek Economy.

Apart from the above publications, KEPE has is very active in the production of unpublished studies, reports and position papers assigned by ministries or other bodies, aimed at supporting economic policy decisions.

KEPE runs a specialised [[research library]], with a rich collection of Greek and international books and journals in economics and social sciences at large. In addition, KEPE is in contact with similar foreign institutions, and exchanges publications, views and information on current economic developments and research methods.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kepe.gr&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Codarts University for the Arts''' ({{lang-nl|Codarts hogeschool voor de kunsten}}) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[vocational university]] in [[Rotterdam]] that teaches music, dance and circus. It was established in its present location in 2000.

==History==

Codarts can trace its origins to the  Rotterdam Conservatorium voor Muziek (Rotterdam Conservatory of Music), popularly known as the Conservatorium Holthaus after its director, Jos Holthaus (1879-1943).&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;
In 1930 the alternative Rotterdamsch Toonkunst Conservatorium (Rotterdam Musical Arts Conservatory) was founded with the composer [[Willem Pijper]] as director.&lt;ref name=Historici/&gt;
The Rotterdamse Dansschool (Rotterdam Dance School) was established in 1931 by [[Corrie Hartong]] as director and the German dancer [[Gertrud Leistikow]] as a teacher.&lt;ref name=Historici/&gt;  
At first the dance school was part of the Conservatorium Holthaus.&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;
In 1935 the dance school transferred to Pijper's conservatory.  
Hartong remained as director. She was to stay in this position until 1961, and continued to teach until 1967.&lt;ref name=Historici/&gt;

[[World War II]] broke out in 1939 and the Netherlands were invaded in May 1940. On 14 May 1940 the buildings of the dance school and the main building of Pijper's conservatory were destroyed by bombs.  It was decided to merge Pijper's and Holthaus's conservatories into one building on Mathenesserlaan, where Holthaus had a branch.
Soon they moved again to a big old house that had somehow been spared, totally surrounded by rubble, and managed to continue day classes and early evening classes before curfew throughout the remainder of the war.
Until Holthaus died in 1943 the combined conservatory had two directors.&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;

The Rotterdamse Dansschool was renamed the Rotterdamse Dansacademie (Rotterdam Dance Academy) in 1954.  In 1986 the Conservatory and Dance Academy became the Hogeschool voor Muziek en Theater Rotterdam (Rotterdam University of Music and Theatre).&lt;ref name=Bloeme/&gt;
The school moved into its present modern building next to the [[De Doelen|Doelen]] concert hall in 2000 under the name Codarts - hogeschool voor de kunsten (Codarts - University of the Arts).&lt;ref name=Hoogstad/&gt;
The Circus arts program was launched in September 2006.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;

==Schools==
[[File:Codarts Big Band, conducted by Ilja Reijngoud.jpg|thumb|Codarts Big Band, conducted by [[Ilja Reijngoud]], at the [[North Sea Jazz Festival]], July 2008]]
Codarts has three divisions: the Rotterdam Conservatory, Rotterdam Dance Academy, and Rotterdam Circus Arts.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;

The Rotterdam Conservatory is one of the largest conservatories in the Netherlands, with over 900 pupils.
It offers courses through which students may obtain a bachelor's degree in any of several disciplines: Music Theater, Pop, Jazz, Composition/arranging, Music Production, Argentinean tango, Indian music, Flamenco, Latin/Latin jazz/Brazilian, Turkish music, Classical music, and Music in Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The school puts on public performances, at times using the adjacent [[De Doelen]] concert hall.
Thus in April 2011 guest conductor [[Arie van Beek]] led the Codarts Orchestra and Codarts Chamber Choir in a performance in the Jurriaanse Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In September 2011 the Codarts Ensemble performed a program that explored the boundary between classical music and jazz, 
with works by Stravinsky, Gershwin, Shostakovich, Antheil and Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Codarts Ensemble played again at De Doelen in March 2012 with the Codarts Chamber Choir, performing a major work by [[Arthur Honegger]].
They were conducted by [[Wiecher Mandemaker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Dance Academy teaches dancers and arranges for students to appear in performances and tours.
Codarts helps students gain practical experience with internships with noted dance companies, and participates in student exchange programs with other European and American dance schools.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;
In May 2011 the Rotterdam Dance Academy performed at the [[Venice Biennale]] with a show called ''Talent on the Move''.
The program included works by established choreographers such as  [[Jiří Kylián]], [[Nacho Duato]] and [[Mauro Bigonzetti]] and by younger artists including graduates of the academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Circus Arts school began offering a bachelor's course in September 2006, training students for careers in [[Contemporary circus|contemporary]] and traditional circus, in [[variety show]]s and in local or street theater.&lt;ref name=selfgeneral/&gt;
Circus students learn dance and drama as well as a wide range of circus techniques to prepare for a professional career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Havo voor Muziek en Dans]] (High School for Music and Dance) provides a secondary school education in which music and dance are part of the daily curriculum. It is co-located in the Codarts building and Codarts teachers teach the music and dance classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Building==
[[File:CodartsRotterdam2017.jpg|thumb|Codarts Rotterdam]]
The building abuts the 1966 [[De Doelen]] concert and conference building, home of the [[Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was built as part of an overall plan for an extension to De Doelen defined in 1993 by Jan Hoogstad.
A new building site beside the Kruisplein was created by reducing the size of Karel Doormanstraat, and this was used for the Doelen extension and the Codarts building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=DE DOELEN |work=Mimoa
 |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The building was developed by the architectural firm of [[Jan Hoogstad|Ector Hoogstad]], and was completed in 2000.
The plinth is mainly used for commercial purposes.
The building is relatively high to accommodate all the demands of the school, and has a total floor space of {{convert|10500|m2}}.
Visually, the Codarts building appears to reach over the end of the conference center.&lt;ref name=Hoogstad/&gt;

The building's steel skeleton supports a "box in box" design for the interior spaces, including several tall spaces with variable lighting.
A long escalator connects the entrance lobby to the fifth floor.
This is the main floor for Codarts, holding the restaurant, library and several performance rooms, and opening onto a terrace on the roof of the Doelen extension.
Codarts occupies classrooms and offices below this floor.  
The conservatory is above it and the large dance studios are at the top of the building.
The building is clad in brick to give an appearance consistent with nearby apartment buildings.&lt;ref name=Hoogstad/&gt;

==Notable alumni==
* [[Henk van der Vliet]] (1950), Dutch composer and flautist
* [[Willemijn Verkaik#cite note-Nieuws-1|Willemijn Verkaik]], Dutch theatre actress, best known for playing Elphaba from the musical [[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]] in the Netherlands, Germany, New York and London.
* [[San Holo]], Dutch record producer and DJ.

{{Rights}}
The '''cultural rights''' movement has provoked attention to protect the rights of groups of people, or their [[culture]], in similar fashion to the manner in which the [[human rights]] movement has brought attention to the needs of individuals throughout the world.

==Protecting a culture==
Cultural Rights are rights related to art and culture, both understood in a large sense. The objective of these rights is to guarantee that people and communities have an access to culture and can participate in the culture of their selection. Cultural rights are human rights that aim at assuring the enjoyment of culture and its components in conditions of equality, human dignity and non-discrimination. They are rights related to themes such as [[linguistic rights|language]]; cultural and artistic production; participation in cultural life; cultural heritage; intellectual property rights; [[cultural diversity|author’s rights]]; [[minority group|minorities]] and access to culture, among others. Focusing less on the preservation of cultures as an end in itself and more on the realization of "ecological" relations between cultural groups as a condition for equitable interactions and the potential for organic cultural change, Meyjes proposes the interchangeable terms cultural justice &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|1999|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2012|p=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ethno-cultural justice&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Meyjes|2012|pp=12, 381ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[intercultural justice]] — which he defines as the principle of maximally accommodating the culturally-specific values and practices of minority groups and their members, in the form of rights, within the overall legal, regulatory, or policy limits of the institution, community, or society concerned (also see [[universalization]]).

==Ethnic Groups Cultural preservation==
Cultural rights of groups focus on such things as religious and ethnic minorities and indigenous societies that are in danger of disappearing. Cultural rights include a group’s ability to preserve its way of life, such as child rearing, continuation of [[language]], and security of its economic base in the nation, which it is located. The related notion of indigenous '''''intellectual property rights''''' (IPR) has arisen in attempt to conserve each society’s culture base and essentially prevent [[ethnocide]].

The cultural rights movement has been popularized because much traditional cultural knowledge has commercial value, like ethno-medicine, cosmetics, cultivated plants, foods, [[folklore]], arts, crafts, songs, dances, costumes, and [[rituals]]. Studying ancient cultures may reveal evidence about the history of the human race and shed more light on our origin and successive cultural development. However, the study, sharing and commercialization of such cultural aspects can be hard to achieve without infringing upon the cultural rights of those who are a part of that culture.

Cultural rights should be taken into consideration also by local policies. In that sense, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]], the first document with worldwide mission that advocates establishing the groundwork of an undertaking by cities and local governments for cultural development, includes as cultural rights as one of the principles and states: “''Local governments recognize that cultural rights are an integral part of human rights, taking as their reference the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948)''”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agenda21culture.net Agenda 21 for culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural anthropology==
"Cultural rights are vested not in individuals but in groups, such as religious and ethnic [[minority group|minorities]] and [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] societies." All cultures are brought up differently, therefore cultural rights include a group's ability to preserve its culture, to raise its children in the ways it forebears, to continue its language, and to not be deprived of its economic base by the nation in which it is located." Anthropologists sometimes choose not to study some cultures beliefs and rights, because they believe that it may cause misbehavior, and they choose not to turn against different diversities of cultures. Although anthropologists sometimes do turn away from studying different cultures they still depend a lot on what they study at different archaeological sites.

DHSI has an International Advisory Board.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dhsi.org/bios.php|title=DHSI Administration and Operation Team|last=|first=|date=|website=dhsi.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both the past and present, major overarching themes of DHSI have included collaboration, interdisciplinarity, and the creation and cultivation of a larger Digital Humanities community beyond the structure of the typical academic environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bialkowski, Voytek, Rebecca Niles, Alan Galey (2011-04/05).

DHSI's course offerings run parallel to the DHSI Conference &amp; Colloquium, formerly known as the DHSI Colloquium. Founded in 2009 by Diane Jakacki and Cara                Leitch, the event invited graduate-only submissions until 2011.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dhsicolloquium.org/about|title=DHSI Colloquium: About|last=|first=|date=|website=DHSI Colloquium|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O’Sullivan|first=James|last2=Galvin|first2=Mary|last3=Jakacki|first3=Diane|date=2016|title=Introduction to the Digital Humanities Summer Institute Colloquium Special Issue|url=http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/1/000241/000241.html|journal=Digital Humanities Quarterly|volume=10|issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
DHSI started in 2001 at [[Vancouver Island University]]. The inaugural DHSI event included lead speakers Susan Hockey, Nancy Ide, Willard McCarty, and [[John Unsworth]], and there were some 35 participants in attendance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2004, DHSI moved to the University of Victoria, where it currently resides.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bialkowski, Voytek, Rebecca Niles, Alan Galey (2011-04/05).

''Faculty of Information Quarterly'' 3(3), 20. Retrieved 2014-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that, as of 2012, there were approximately 1,800 alumni of the institute, with a large portion returning over a period of multiple years to take further courses.&lt;ref&gt;Pannapacker, William (2012-07-22).

'''Direct trade''' is a form of [[procurement|sourcing]] practiced by certain [[coffee roaster]]s and [[chocolate maker]]s who build direct relationships with the farmers and processors who sell them coffee or cocoa beans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/dining/12coff.html|title=To Burundi and Beyond for Coffee’s Holy Grail|last=Meehan|first=Peter|date=2007-09-12|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single set of direct trade standards, and specific trade practices vary as a reflection of business and ethical priorities of the roaster or maker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lexiconoffood.com/labeling-and-certification/direct-trade|title=Direct Trade|work=Lexicon of Food|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, however, direct trade practitioners view their model as one of mutually-beneficial and transparent trade relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethicalcoffee.net/direct.html|title=What is Direct Trade coffee?|website=www.ethicalcoffee.net|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some advocates explicitly define direct trade as an alternative to [[fairtrade certification]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lexiconoffood.com/image/direct-vs-fair-trade-coffee|title=Contrasting Direct Trade and Fair Trade Coffee|date=2014-10-02|work=Lexicon of Food|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they seek to address perceived limitations of [[fair trade]] by:

'''Fair Trade''' practices -- such as those certified by Fairtrade International -- are designed to promote ethical trading standards to the benefit of the poorest of coffee producers in developing countries, providing opportunities for assistance with infrastructural growth, access to credit and financing to the farmers, and ensure ethical labor regulations for certified farms. Many studies have found that Fair Trade has brought stabilization to the world coffee market, as well as improved many coffee producing farms world wide&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ingenbleek, P., &amp; Reinders, T.|first=|date=2013|title=The development of a market for sustainable coffee in The Netherlands: Rethinking the contribution of Fair Trade|url=|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=113 (3).|pages=461-474|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the efficacy of Fair Trade practices have become under a wide range of criticism ranging from less than advertised, to beneficial to large plantations but detrimental to the smallest of farms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruben, R., &amp; Fort.|first=|date=2011|title=The impact of Fair Trade certification for coffee farmers in Peru.|url=|journal=World Development.|volume=40 (3)|pages=570-582|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, unethical disbursement of profits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griffiths, P.|first=|date=July 2011|title=Ethical objections to Fairtrade.|url=|journal=Journal of Business Ethics.|volume=105 (3)|pages=357|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and even claims of a corrupt tool for marketing and profit causing death and destruction to coffee producers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole, N., &amp; Brown, K.|first=|date=2014|title=The problem with Fair Trade coffee.|url=|journal=Contexts, ,13 (1)|volume=13 (1)|pages=13 (1)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A study from 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruben, R., &amp; Zuniga, G.|first=|date=2011|title=How standards compete : Comparative impact of coffee certification schemes in Northern Nicaragua.|url=|journal=Supply Chain Management: An International Journal|volume=16(2)|pages=98-109.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that Fair Trade strategies have a greater impact on the overall infrastructure development of growing coffee farms, and direct trades models show to have a greater impact on increased wages, and an overall improved quality of life, reported by the farmers included in the study. 

While such practices are common among self-identified direct trade coffee roasters and chocolate makers, there is no single definition of direct trade nor set of common standards. A lack of third-party accountability is a frequent criticism leveled by direct trade critics, which include former proponents frustrated by what they perceive as a trend of large, marketing-savvy roasters "who bombard consumers with the term despite not offering any clear definition of its meaning, any evidence of an actual direct trade scheme or the slightest shred of transparency regarding sourcing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycoffeenews.com/2017/05/10/direct-trade-is-dead-long-live-its-founding-principles/|title=Direct Trade is Dead, Long Live its Founding Principles|date=2017-05-10|website=Daily Coffee News by Roast Magazine|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fiber roll''' is a temporary [[erosion control]] and [[sediment control]] device used on [[construction]] sites to protect [[water quality]] in nearby streams, rivers, lakes and seas from sediment erosion. It is made of [[straw]], [[coconut]] fiber or similar material formed into a tubular roll.

==Installation==
Each horizontal contour level row of fiber rolls is installed on slopes, ending with one at the base of the slope, below an active construction area before [[soil]] disturbance (earth moving) begins. The space between  each row of fiber roll is dependent on the steepness of the slope.  The steeper the slope, the more rows of evenly spaced horizontal contour level fiber rolls are used. Each fiber roll is installed on a horizontal contour level in shallow trenches 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) deep and fastened to the ground with wooden stakes.

Properly installed fiber rolls are effective at trapping [[sediment]], generally more effectively than [[straw bale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casqa.org California Stormwater Quality Association.] Menlo Park, CA.
[http://www.cabmphandbooks.com/Documents/Construction/SE-5.pdf "California Stormwater BMP Handbook: Fiber Rolls."] Fact Sheet No. SE-5. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. EPA.

Water passes through a fiber roll while leaving behind the sediment on the uphill side of the roll, thereby reducing sediment [[erosion]].

==Limitations==
Fiber Rolls have several limitations to their uses:&lt;ref name="Fiber Rolls"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiber Rolls|url=http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=factsheet_results&amp;view=specific&amp;bmp=121|work=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|accessdate=14 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214224255/http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=factsheet_results&amp;view=specific&amp;bmp=121|archivedate=14 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Fiber rolls may be difficult to move once they become saturated with water.
*Fiber rolls should not be used on very steep land that is prone to mudslides, landslides or creep.
*If fiber rolls are not properly staked into the ground, they may be carried away by high flows.

The discipline of '''forensic epidemiology (FE)''' is a hybrid of principles and practices common to both [[forensic medicine]] and [[epidemiology]]. FE is directed at filling the gap between clinical judgment and epidemiologic data for determinations of causality in civil [[lawsuits]] and criminal prosecution and defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Michael|last2=Zeegers|first2=Maurice|title=Forensic Epidemiology: Principles and Practices|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780124045842|url=http://store.elsevier.com/product.jsp?isbn=9780124045842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koehler|first=Steven A.|last2=Freeman|first2=Michael D.|date=2014-06-01|title=Forensic epidemiology: a method for investigating and quantifying specific causation|journal=Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology|volume=10|issue=2|pages=217–222|doi=10.1007/s12024-013-9513-8|issn=1556-2891|pmid=24272789}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Michael D.|last2=Rossignol|first2=Annette M.|last3=Hand|first3=Michael L.|date=2009-02-01|title=Applied forensic epidemiology: the Bayesian evaluation of forensic evidence in vehicular homicide investigation|journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine|volume=16|issue=2|pages=83–92|doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2008.08.017|issn=1752-928X|pmid=19135003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Michael D.|last2=Rossignol|first2=Annette M.|last3=Hand|first3=Michael L.|date=2008-07-01|title=Forensic Epidemiology: a systematic approach to probabilistic determinations in disputed matters|journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine|volume=15|issue=5|pages=281–290|doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2007.12.009|issn=1752-928X|pmid=18511002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic epidemiologists formulate [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] probabilistic conclusions about the type and quantity of causal association between an antecedent harmful exposure and an injury or disease outcome in both populations and individuals. The conclusions resulting from an FE analysis can support legal decision-making regarding guilt or innocence in criminal actions, and provide an evidentiary support for findings of [[causation (law)|causal association]] in civil actions.

Applications of forensic epidemiologic principles are found in a wide variety of types of civil litigation, including cases of medical negligence, toxic or mass tort, pharmaceutical adverse events, medical device and consumer product failures, traffic crash-related injury and death, person identification and life expectancy.

== History of FE ==
The term Forensic Epidemiology was first associated with the investigation of bioterrorism in 1999, and coined by Dr. Ken Alibek, the former chief deputy of the Soviet bioweapons program. The scope of FE at that time was confined to the investigation of epidemics that were potentially man-made. After the US Anthrax attacks of 2001 the CDC defined forensic epidemiology as a means of investigating possible acts of bioterrorism.

At the present time FE is more widely known and described as the systematic application of epidemiology to disputed issues of causation that are decided in (primarily) civil, but also criminal courts. The use of epidemiologic data and analysis as a basis for assessing general causation in US courts, particularly in toxic tort cases, has been described for more than 30 years, beginning with the investigation of the alleged relationship between exposure to the Swine Flu vaccine in 1976 and subsequent cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome.[http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/SciMan3D12.pdf/$file/SciMan3D12.pdf]

More recently FE has also been described as an evidence-based method of quantifying the probability of specific causation in individuals. The approach is particularly helpful when a clinical differential diagnosis approach to causation is disputed. Examples covering a wide variety of applications of FE are listed below under Examples of Investigative Questions Addressed by Forensic Epidemiologists.

== FE Methods and Principles ==

=== Comparative Risk Ratio ===
The metric of a case-specific FE analysis of cause is the comparative risk ratio (CRR).  The CRR is a unique metric to FE; it allows for the comparison of probabilities applicable to the investigated circumstances of an individual injury or disease.  Because a CRR is based on the unique circumstances surrounding the injury or disease of an individual, it may or may not be derived from a population-based [[relative risk]] (RR) or [[odds ratio]] (OR). An example of an RR analysis that could be used as a CRR  is as follows: for an unbelted driver who was seriously injured in a traffic crash, an important causal question might be what role the failure to use a seat belt played in causing his injury. A relevant RR analysis would consist of the examination of the frequency of serious injury in 1000 randomly selected unbelted drivers exposed to a 20&amp;nbsp;mph frontal collision versus the frequency of serious injury in 1000 randomly selected restrained drivers exposed to the same collision severity and type. If the frequency of serious injury in the group exposed to the presumptive hazard (failure to use a seat belt) was 0.15 and the frequency in the unexposed (belted) group was 0.05, then the CRR would be the same thing as the RR of 0.15/0.05. The RR design of the analysis dictates that the populations that the numerator and denominator of the CRR  are substantially similar in all respects, with the exception of the exposure to the investigated hazard, which was the failure to use a seat belt in the example.

In some instances encountered in a legal setting, however, the numerator and denominator risk must be derived from dissimilar populations in order to fit the circumstances of an investigated injury or disease. In such a case the CRR cannot be derived from either an RR or OR. An example of such a situation occurs when the numerator is a per event risk, and the denominator is a per-time risk (also known as a cumulative risk). An example of this type of analysis would be the investigation of a pulmonary embolism (PE) that occurred a week after a patient sustained a lower extremity fracture in a traffic crash. Such complications often result from blood clots forming in the legs and then traveling to the lungs. If the patient had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities prior to the crash, then a CRR might consist of the comparison between the risk of a PE following a lower extremity fracture (a per event rate) and  the 1-week risk of PE in a patient with DVT (a time-dependent probability).

Another example of a CRR based on dissimilar populations is when there are only a limited number of potential causes to be compared. An example is the investigation of the cause of an adverse reaction in a person who took two different drugs at the same time, both of which could have caused the reaction (and which, for the example, do not interact with each other). In such a situation, the CRR applicable to the unique circumstances experienced by the individual could be estimated by comparing the adverse reaction rate for the two drugs.

=== Attributable Proportion Under the Exposed ===
The attributable proportion under the exposed (AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; ) is an indication of the proportion of patients who were exposed to the potential cause and got sick because of this exposure. It can only be used if the RR &gt;1 and can be calculated by [(RR-1)/RR X 100%]. When the CRR is based on an RR, these formulae also apply to the CRR. The result of the analysis, given as an RR, CRR, or AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; , meets the legal standard of what is “''[[Legal burden of proof|more likely true than not]]'',”  when the RR or CRR is &gt;2.0 (with a 95% confidence interval lower boundary of &gt;1.0), or the AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is &gt;50%. The AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is also known as the "''Probability of Causation'' (PC)" a term that is defined in the US Code of Federal Regulations ([https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/pdfs/42cfr81/42cfr81.pdf Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 85 / Thursday, May 2, 2002 / Rules and Regulations p. 22297]) and elsewhere.

=== Causal Methodology ===
Analysis of causation, particularly for injury or other conditions with a relatively short latency period between exposure and outcome, is accomplished using a 3-step approach, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Michael D.|last2=Centeno|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Kohles|first3=Sean S.|date=2009-10-01|title=A systematic approach to clinical determinations of causation in symptomatic spinal disk injury following motor vehicle crash trauma|journal=PM &amp; R: the journal of injury, function, and rehabilitation|volume=1|issue=10|pages=951–956|doi=10.1016/j.pmrj.2009.07.009|issn=|pmid=19854423|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Plausibility: This first step addresses whether it is biologically ''possible'' for the injury event to have caused the condition (a.k.a. general causation), and follows a special application of the viewpoints set forth by Hill (see below). A finding of plausibility is unrelated to the ''frequency'' of the injury, because even if the injury occurs in only 1 in 100 or fewer cases of exposure to the event, it is still ''plausibly'' caused by the event. Plausibility is a relatively low hurdle to clear in a causal analysis, and is largely satisfied by the lack of evidence of ''implausibility'' of the relationship. Plausibility is often, but not necessarily, established with epidemiologic data or information.
# Temporality: This second step examines the clinical and other evidence of the timing between the onset of the symptoms of injury and the injury event, and must be satisfied to assess specific causation. First, it must be established that the sequence of the injury and the event is appropriate; the symptoms cannot be identically present prior to the event. Further, the onset of the symptoms of injury cannot be either too latent or insufficiently latent, depending on the nature of the exposure and outcome.
# Lack of a more probable alternative explanation: This final step examines the probability of the injury condition occurring at the same point in time in the individual, given what is known about the individual from the review of medical records and other evidence, but in the absence of the injury event (a.k.a. differential diagnosis). First, evidence of competing injury events must be evaluated, and compared for risk (often via analysis of epidemiologic data). Then, the likelihood of the condition occurring spontaneously must be assessed, given the known history of the individual.

==== United States Case Law on Injury Causation Methodology ====
The 3-step methodology was challenged in United States District Court for the District of Colorado in ''Etherton v Auto-Owners Insurance Company.''[https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/colorado/codce/1:2010cv00892/118960/145] The defendant challenged, among other things, the reliability and fit of the methods described by the expert. After an extensive examination and discussion of the 3-step process used by the expert, the Court found that the methodology appropriately fit the specific facts of the case, and that a population-based (epidemiologic) approach was an appropriate part of the causal methodology. The Court denied the Defendant’s motion to strike the expert’s testimony in the order, which was entered on 3/3l/l4.

The Defendant appealed the ruling from the District Court, and in July 2016, the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the 3-step causal methodology as generally accepted and well established for assessing injury causation, under the [[Daubert standard]].  See ''Etherton v. Auto-Owners Insurance Company'', No. 14-1164 (10th Cir, 7/l9/l6)[https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/14/14-1164.pdf].

==== The Hill Viewpoints ====
[[Biological plausibility|Plausibility]] of an investigated association can be assessed in an FE investigation, in part, via application of the [[Bradford Hill criteria|Hill criteria]], named for a 1965 publication by Sir Austin Bradford-Hill, in which he described nine “viewpoints” by which an association described in an epidemiologic study could be assessed for causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=A. B.|date=1965-05-01|title=THE ENVIRONMENT AND DISEASE: ASSOCIATION OR CAUSATION?|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=58|pages=295–300|issn=0035-9157|pmc=1898525|pmid=14283879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill declined to call his viewpoints “criteria”  lest they be considered a checklist for assessing causation. The term “ Hill criteria”  is used widely in the literature, however, and for convenience is used in the present discussion. Of the nine criteria, there are seven that have utility for assessing the plausibility of an investigated specific causal relationship, as follows:
* Coherence: A causal conclusion should not contradict present substantive knowledge. It should “ make sense”  given current knowledge
* Analogy: The results of a previously described causal relationship may be translatable to the circumstances of a current investigation
* Consistency: The repeated observation of the investigated relationship in different circumstances or across a number of studies lends strength to a causal inference
* Specificity: The degree to which the exposure is associated with a particular outcome
* Biological plausibility: The extent to which the observed association can be explained by known scientific principles
* Experiment: In some cases there may be evidence from randomized experiments (''i.e.'', drug trials)
* Dose response: The probability, frequency, or severity of the outcome increases with increased amount of exposure
[[File:Assessing the role of a confounder.png|thumb|The triangular relationship between exposure, outcome, and confounder. When investigating whether there is a causal relationship between an exposure and outcome of interest, the influence of extraneous variables needs to be taken into account. A confounder is defined as a concurrent cause of the outcome under investigation that is related to, but not a consequence of, the exposure of interest.]]
Subsequent authors have added the feature of [[Challenge–dechallenge–rechallenge|Challenge/ Dechallenge/ Rechallenge]] for circumstances when the exposure is repeated over time and there is the ability to observe the associated outcome response, as might occur with an adverse reaction to a medication. Additional considerations when assessing an association are the potential impact of [[confounding]] and [[Bias of an estimator|bias]] in the data, which can obscure a true relationship. Confounding refers to a situation in which an association between an exposure and outcome is all or partly the result of a factor that affects the outcome but is unaffected by the exposure. Bias refers to a form of error that may threaten the validity of a study by producing results that are systematically different from the true results. Two main categories of bias in epidemiologic studies are [[selection bias]], which occurs when study subjects are selected as a result of another unmeasured variable that is associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest; and [[Information bias (epidemiology)|information bias]], which is systematic error in the assessment of a variable. While useful when assessing a previously unexplored association, there is no combination or minimal number of these criteria that must be met in order to conclude that a plausible relationship exists between a known exposure and an observed outcome.

In many FE investigations there is no need for a causal plausibility analysis if a general causal relationship is well established. In large part, plausibility of a relationship is entertained once implausibility has been rejected. The two remaining Hill criteria are temporality  and strength of association. While both criteria have utility in assessing specific causation, temporality is the feature of an association that must be present, at least with regard to sequence (''i.e.'', the exposure must precede the outcome), in order to consider a relationship causal. Temporal proximity can also be useful in some specific causation evaluations, as the closer the investigated exposure and the outcome are in time the less opportunity there is for an intervening cause to act. Another feature of temporality that may have a role in a specific causation evaluation is latency. An outcome may occur too soon or too long after an exposure to be considered causally related. As an example, some food borne illnesses must incubate for hours or days after ingestion, and thus an illness that begins directly following a meal, and which is later found to be caused by a food borne microorganism that requires &gt;12 h incubation, was not caused by the investigated meal, even if an investigation were to reveal the microorganism in the ingested food. Strength of association is the criterion that is used in general causation to assess the impact of the exposure on the population, and is often quantified in terms of RR. In a specific causation evaluation the strength of the association between the exposure and the outcome is quantified by the CRR, as described above.
[[File:Contingency table of test accuracy metrics.png|thumb|A contingency table, also called a crosstabulation, of possible test outcomes, and the associated equations for evaluating test accuracy.]]

=== Test Accuracy ===
Test accuracy investigation is a standard practice in clinical epidemiology. In this setting, a diagnostic test is scrutinized to determine by various measures how often a test result is correct. In FE the same principles are used to evaluate the accuracy of proposed tests leading to conclusions that are central to fact finder determinations of guilt or innocence in criminal investigations, and of causality in civil matters. The utility of a test is highly dependent on its accuracy, which is determined by a measure of how often a positive or negative test result truly represents the actual status that is being tested. For any test or criterion there are typically four possible results: (1) a true positive (TP), in which the test correctly identifies tested subjects with the condition of interest; (2) a true negative (TN), in which the test correctly identifies test subjects who do not have the condition of interest; (3) a false positive (FP), in which the test is positive even though condition is not present, and; (4) a false negative (FN) in which the test is negative even though the condition is present. Fig. 3.19 is a contingency table illustrating the relationships between test results and condition presence, as well as the following test accuracy parameters:
* [[Sensitivity and specificity|Sensitivity]] (the rate at which the test is positive when the condition is present) TP/(TP + FN)
* [[Sensitivity and specificity|Specificity]] (the rate at which the test is negative when the condition is absent) TN/(TN + FP)
* [[Positive and negative predictive values|Positive predictive value]] (the rate at which the condition is present when the test is positive) TP/(TP + FP)
* [[Positive and negative predictive values|Negative predictive value]] (the rate at which the condition is absent when the test is negative) TN/(TN + FN)

=== Bayesian Reasoning ===
Probability is used to characterize the degree of belief in the truth of an assertion. The basis for such a belief can be a physical system that produces outcomes at a rate that is uniform over time, such as a gaming device like a roulette wheel or a die. With such a system, the observer does not influence the outcome; a fair six-sided die that is rolled enough times will land on any one of its sides 1/6th of the time. An assertion of a probability based in a physical system is easily tested with sufficient randomized experimentation. Conversely, the basis for a high degree of belief in an asserted claim may be a personally held perspective that cannot be tested. This does not mean that the assertion is any less true than one that can be tested. As an example, one might truthfully assert that “if I eat a banana there is a high probability that it will make me nauseous” based upon experience unknown to anyone but one’s self. It is difficult to test such assertions, which are evaluated through collateral evidence of plausibility and analogy, often based on similar personal experience. In forensic settings, assertions of belief are often characterized as probabilities, that is, ''what is most likely'', for a given set of facts. For circumstances in which a variety of conditions exist that may modify or “ condition”  the probability of a particular outcome or scenario, a method of quantifying the relationship between the modifying conditions and the probability of the outcome employs [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian reasoning]], named for [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes’ Theorem]] or Law upon which the approach is based. Most simply stated, Bayes’ Law allows for a more precise quantification of the uncertainty in a given probability. As applied in a forensic setting, Bayes’ Law tells us what we want to know given what we do know. Although Bayes’  Law is known in forensic sciences primarily for its application to DNA evidence, a number of authors have described the use of Bayesian reasoning for other applications in forensic medicine, including identification and age estimation.

=== Post-test Probability and Positive Predictive Value ===
The [[Pre- and post-test probability|post-test probability]] is a highly useful Bayesian equation that allows for the calculation of the probability that a condition is present when the test is positive, conditioned by the pretest prevalence of the condition of interest. This equation is given in box to the right:
[[File:Post-test probability.png|thumb|Post-test probability equation]]
The equation results in a positive predictive value for a given pre-event or pretest prevalence. In a circumstance in which the pretest prevalence is considered “indifferent” the prevalence and (1-prevalence) values cancel out, and the calculation is a simplified to a positive predictive value.

'''The Great American Songbook Foundation''' is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the music of the [[Great American Songbook]]. Located on the campus of the Center for the Performing Arts in [[Carmel, Indiana]], the Songbook Foundation's administrative offices are located on the Gallery level of the [[The Palladium at the Center for Performing Arts|Palladium]], a 1600-seat concert hall that opened in January 2011. The organization was previously known as the Michael Feinstein Foundation for the Education and Preservation of the Great American Songbook and the Michael Feinstein Great American Songbook Initiative; in July 2014, the organization's board of directors voted to change its name to the Great American Songbook Foundation.

== History and operation ==
[[File:The Palladium.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Palladium at the Center for the Performing Arts]]
[[Michael Feinstein|Michael Feinstein's]] lifetime interest in, and immense knowledge of, the music of the [[Great American Songbook]] led him to found the organization in 2007. Upon Feinstein's appointment as Artistic Director of [[The Palladium at the Center for Performing Arts|the Center for the Performing Arts]] in 2009, the organization committed to locating its headquarters and archives on the Center's campus in Carmel, Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Handelman, "Behind the Scenes: Feinstein Works to Preserve Classic Music", ''Herald-Tribune'' Sunday, March 31, 2013, retrieved from http://arts.heraldtribune.com/2013-03-31/featured/behind-the-scenes-feinstein-works-to-preserve-classic-music/.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great American Songbook Foundation's administrative headquarters houses a reference library, study and listening rooms for researchers, archival storage space, and the Songbook Exhibit Gallery, an exhibit space featuring rotating interactive presentations about the music, its creators and the performers of the Great American Songbook.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Henning, "A Cultural Conversation with Michael Feinstein: Saving the Songbook", ''Wall Street Journal'', Feb. 2, 2012, retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/919205138&lt;/ref&gt; The long-term goal of the Great American Songbook Foundation is to construct a free-standing museum on the campus of the Center with additional exhibit, instructional, and programming space.

The Great American Songbook Foundation is staffed by four full-time employees. They are assisted by a volunteer group of docents who serve as guides for the Songbook Exhibit Gallery and a team of collections assistants who assist the archivist with the Songbook Foundation's ongoing preservation efforts. The Songbook Foundation's national board of directors currently has twenty-two members.

== Education and outreach ==
The Great American Songbook Foundation offers a variety of programs about the history and significance of the Great American Songbook that are accessible to the public and appeal to music enthusiasts of all ages.

=== Songbook Exhibit Gallery ===
[[File:Songbook Gallery- Blast From the Past.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Songbook Exhibit Gallery is located in the Foundation's administrative headquarters in Carmel, Indiana.]]
The Songbook Exhibit Gallery features rotating exhibits and welcomes over 3500 visitors each year. These rotating exhibits provide guests with a view of the Songbook that is both educational and entertaining, and helps them to place the music of this era in context with the significant events and major cultural shifts that occurred in the United States during the twentieth century. The Songbook Foundation offers corresponding educational programs and guided tours for school groups, civic and professional organizations, and members of the general public. The Songbook Gallery is open Monday through Friday from 10:00am to 4:00pm, and one hour before all Jazz and Songbook Series performances at the Palladium.

Since 2011, the Songbook Foundation has presented the following exhibits: "The Great American Songbook" (2011), "G.I.

The exhibit now on display is "Ella Sings the Songbook", celebrating [[Ella Fitzgerald]]'s 100th birthday and commemorating her more than fifty-year career, much of which was spent performing music from the Great American Songbook.  In particular, the exhibit highlights the series of eight albums of Songbook music sung by Ella under the direction of [[Norman Granz]] and issued by [[Verve Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/01/19/ella-fitzgerald-centennial-carmel-indiana-palladium-songbook-verve-feinstein/96776082/|title=Carmel exhibit celebrates Ella Fitzgerald centennial|last=Lindquist|first=David|date=January 19, 2017|newspaper=Indianapolis Star|access-date=2017-02-22|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These exhibits focus on different time periods, styles, and artists.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Handelman, "Behind the Scenes", 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the interactive display which houses clips and short biographies of over four decades of singers and songwriters,  artifacts from the Songbook Archives that relate to the music and musicians being highlighted in the Songbook Gallery exhibits are displayed.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Grossberg, "Archive Promotes Classic American Songs", ''The Columbus Dispatch'' Sunday April 21, 2013, retrieved from http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/travel/2013/04/21/1-archive-promotes-classic-american-songs.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Great American Songbook Foundation partnered with four other institutions to form the Exhibit Alliance, a group of organizations that presented concurrent exhibits on the 1960s. The Exhibit Alliance continues to grow and now includes the Great American Songbook Foundation, the [[Indiana Historical Society]], the [[Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library]], the [[Indianapolis Public Library]], the Carmel-Clay Historical Society and the Carmel-Clay Public Library.

=== Songbook Academy® Summer Intensive ===
[[File:2014 Songbook Academy.jpg|thumbnail|left|Songbook Academy founder [[Michael Feinstein]] and Grammy-winner [[Cheryl Bentyne]] of [[The Manhattan Transfer]] coaching participants in the 2014 Songbook Academy]]
The Songbook Academy Summer Intensive, formerly known as the High School Vocal Academy and Competition, originated in 2009 and is held annually in July. The program is "the only vocal competition based solely on music from Broadway, Hollywood musicals and the Tin Pan Alley era."&lt;ref&gt;Joel Henning, "A Cultural Conversation", 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past several years, the scope and visibility of the program has grown significantly. The competition initially involved only Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and Ohio; Iowa and Wisconsin were added the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Henning, "A Cultural Conversation", 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Chris Lewis, an educator and musician, joined as director, and four additional states were added.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Henning, "A Cultural Conversation", 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the number of states doubled to twenty-two.&lt;ref&gt;"High School Vocalists Compete at Songbook Finals", ''Current in Fishers'', July 17, 2013, retrieved from http://currentinfishers.com/high-school-vocalists-compete-at-songbook-finals.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Songbook Academy continued expanding its national reach in 2014 with the addition of nine states, for a total of thirty-one states and six regional competition events.

Following the 2014 Songbook Academy, the regional component of the audition process was eliminated; in 2015, forty young singers were invited to Carmel for the Songbook Academy week (previously, only the top two winners from each region were invited). Judges and mentors for 2017 included program founder [[Michael Feinstein]], broadway actress and singer [[Eden Espinosa]], jazz singer and educator Ly Wilder, television writer and producer [[Marc Cherry]], and internationally renowned soprano [[Sylvia McNair]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecenterfortheperformingarts.org/Great-American-Songbook-Inititative/Annual-Competition/2013-Judges Thecenterfortheperformingarts.org Retrieved 21 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In past years, prominent artists including [[Laura Osnes]], [[Jarrod Spector]], [[Sandi Patty]], [[Jane Monheit]], [[Janis Siegel]], and Jim Caruso have served as mentors for the program. The Songbook Academy accepts applications from high school students in all forty-eight contiguous states. The week culminates in a mainstage performance at the Palladium where three participants receive the following awards: the Songbook Inspiration Award, the Songbook Celebration Award, and the title of Great American Songbook Youth Ambassador.

Recent Songbook Academy finalists have performed in major venues in Las Vegas, Pasadena, New York City, Costa Mesa, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and with Michael Feinstein in his appearances throughout the nation. Julia Goodwin, the winner in 2013, was featured with [[Darren Criss]], [[Kelli O'Hara]], and [[Aaron Tveit]] on Feinstein's ''New Years Eve at the Rainbow Room'' special, which was nationally broadcast on [[PBS]] in 2014. In September 2015, Nick Ziobro, Julia Goodwin, Maddie Baillio, and Lucas DeBard performed with the American Pops Orchestra on the Millennium Stage at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]]. These singers also joined Feinstein onstage at New York City's [[Carnegie Hall]] in February 2016. In June 2016, Maddie Baillio was cast as Tracy Turnblad in NBC's production of ''Hairspray Live!''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.playbill.com/article/see-who-hairspray-live-chose-as-the-new-tracy-turnblad&lt;/ref&gt; On July 23, 2016, seventeen year old Finn Sagal of La Canada Flintridge, California was named the 2017 Songbook Youth Ambassador at the conclusion of the Songbook Academy Finals, which is held annually at the Palladium in [[Carmel, Indiana]].

=== Songbook Hall of Fame ===
[[File:Songbook Hall of Fame exhibit- landscape.JPG|thumbnail|right|The Great American Songbook Hall of Fame exhibit is housed in the Shiel Sexton Songbook Lounge at The Palladium.]]
The Great American Songbook Hall of Fame is a tribute to people who have contributed to the genre, memorializing composers, performers, and lyricists who have added to the history of the Songbook.&lt;ref&gt;"Songbook Hall of Fame Names 2013 Honorees", ''The Indianapolis Recorder'' May 14, 2013, retrieved from http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/aroundtown/article_76b47d2a-bcb9-11e2-bd51-0019bb2963f4.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Artists are nominated and selected based on the following criteria:
* Artists who made a significant contribution to the Golden Age of American popular music, typically defined as the period from the early years of the Twentieth century through the 1960s;
* Living songwriters, both lyricists and composers, who have made a significant impact on American pop culture by creating the most beloved songs from the American popular songbook; and
* Artists, songwriters and/or performers who continues to create the soundtrack of our lives by writing and/or performing music that will become the pop standards of tomorrow."&lt;ref&gt;"Songbook Hall of Fame Names 2013 Honorees", 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, the Center for the Performing Arts hosts the Songbook Celebration Gala, a black-tie event that celebrates the lives and careers of the artists who have been selected for induction into the Great American Songbook Hall of Fame. Nominees (or their representatives, in the case of posthumous award winners) are invited to Carmel where they are honored with tribute performances celebrating their achievements. Tribute performers at past Songbook Celebration Gala events include [[Jimmy Smits]], [[Andrea McArdle]], [[Jessica Sanchez]], [[Laura Osnes]], [[Karen Ziemba]], [[Chris Mann (singer)|Chris Mann]], and [[Kristin Chenoweth]].

Great American Songbook Hall of Fame Inductees include [[Alan Bergman|Alan]] &amp; [[Marilyn Bergman]], [[Barry Manilow]], and [[Cole Porter]] (2012); [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Rita Moreno]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Jimmy Webb]] (2013); [[Nat King Cole]], [[Shirley Jones]], [[Johnny Mathis]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]] (2014); [[George Gershwin|George]] &amp; [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Chita Rivera]], and [[Steve Lawrence]] &amp; [[Eydie Gormé]] (2015); and [[Hoagy Carmichael]], [[Diahann Carroll]], and [[Dionne Warwick]] (2016). The 2017 class, consisting of [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Mitzi Gaynor]], and [[Ray Gilbert]], was inducted into the Songbook Hall of Fame on Saturday, September 30 at the annual Songbook Celebration Gala and Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecenterfortheperformingarts.org/Songbook-Celebration&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GRAMMY Museum Cultural Affiliation ===
In July 2017, the Los Angeles-based [[GRAMMY Museum]] announced that the Great American Songbook Foundation has been designated as a Cultural Affiliate, joining four other institutions worldwide: the [[Bob Marley Museum]] in Kingston, Jamaica; the [[Woody Guthrie Center]] in Tulsa, OH; [[The Beatles Story]] in Liverpool, UK; and the [[National Blues Museum]] in St. Louis, MO.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indystar.com/story/entertainment/arts/2017/07/19/grammy-museum-adds-carmels-great-american-songbook-foundation-elite-group/491631001/&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship will allow collaboration between the organizations on exhibits and educational and research programs, among other amenities.

=== Perfect Harmony Music Program ===
Founded in 2015, the Foundation's Perfect Harmony program offers music experiences to people with Alzheimer's, dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases. This new program was launched in collaboration with the Greater Indiana Chapter of the [[Alzheimer's Association]].

Music can enliven the brain and bring joy to people of all abilities, even those with memory problems. The healing power of music is becoming increasingly apparent in numerous studies, as well as in varied practical applications. A comprehensive article in the March/April 2015 issue of Scientific American Mind, "The Healing Power of Music," describes the results of research, along with specific examples of music's impact on the brain. The greatest benefits from music therapy– cognitive, emotional and social– come from intentional engagement with music.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.musicianbrain.com/papers/Thompson_Schlaug_Healing-Power-of-Music_SciAmMind.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During the science-based Perfect Harmony program, participants and caregivers are involved in social singing with Songbook music. As a group, people share experiences related to memorable songs and the monthly theme. Reading lyrics, actively singing together, listening to songs, engaging in short discussion, and fun and games with rhythm, movement, and instruments, increases mood, memory, and overall quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alzheimers.net/2014-07-21/why-music-boosts-brain-activity-in-dementia-patients/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Songbook Film Series ===
The Great American Songbook Foundation partnered with Indianapolis-based Heartland Film and the Center for the Performing Arts to present classic movie musicals to the public, cultivating a new generation of movie lovers. Some screenings included guest speakers, who enlightened audiences on the nature and creation of the movies shown.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Disis, "Heartland Pictures Launches the Great American Songbook Movie Series at the Palladium", Indianapolis Star Sept. 27, 2012, retrieved from http://www.indystar.com/article/20120927/
THINGSTODO04/209280311/Heartland-launches-Great-American-Songbook-Movie-Series-Palladium.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Songbook Film Series is currently on hiatus.''

== Archives, library, and preservation ==
[[File:Songbook Archives.jpg|thumbnail|right|A group of high school students tours the Songbook Archives, which are adjacent to the Foundation's administrative headquarters.]]

The Songbook Archives serves as a repository for the papers of significant Songbook figures including [[Meredith Willson]], [[Hy Zaret]], and [[Gus Kahn]], as well as special collections covering such artists as [[The Andrews Sisters]] in the following formats: sheet music, photos, scrapbooks, posters, LPs, 45s, music magazines, books, lacquer discs, personal papers, theatre playbills, film, video, analog tape, and recordings. Many of these items are currently approaching one hundred years of age. A finite window of time exists to preserve these materials through digitization.

The Foundation's non-circulating library houses a wide variety of reference materials. In addition, students, teachers and researchers from around the world visit the Foundation's website to view and research selections from the Archives, which contains over one hundred collections, 35,000 pieces of sheet music, and 3000 reference books.

Items housed in the Foundation's Archives include:

:* 7000 audio recordings in thirteen different formats, including [[Rudy Vallée]]'s radio transcription discs dating from 1932
:* [[Meredith Willson]]'s personal papers, scripts, and recordings, including [[The Music Man]] and [[The Unsinkable Molly Brown (musical)|The Unsinkable Molly Brown]]
:* Musical orchestrations from [[Bob Hope|Bob]] and [[Dolores Hope]]'s decades of live performances across the globe
:* The piano which was used by composer [[Richard A. Whiting]] to write "[[Hooray for Hollywood]]"
:* [[Hy Zaret]]'s original lyrics for "[[Unchained Melody]]", one of the twentieth century's most frequently recorded songs

{{Anthropology}}
'''Historical anthropology''' is a [[historiographical]] movement which applies methodologies and objectives from [[Social Anthropology|Social]] and [[Cultural Anthropology]] to the study of historical societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. Ten Dyke, 'Anthropology, Historical' in Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, ed. by Kelly Boyd (Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999), pp. 37--40 (p. 37).&lt;/ref&gt; Like most such movements, it is understood in different ways by different scholars, and to some may be synonymous with the [[history of mentalities]], [[cultural history]], [[ethnohistory]], [[microhistory]], [[People's history|history from below]] or ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]''. Anthropologists whose work has been particularly inspirational to historical anthropology include [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Clifford Geertz]], [[Arnold van Gennep]], [[Jack Goody]], [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Victor Turner]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"&gt;Elizabeth A. Ten Dyke, 'Anthropology, Historical' in Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, ed. by Kelly Boyd (Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999), pp. 37--40 (p. 38).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] has contrasted historical anthropology with [[Social History]], finding that historical anthropology tends to focus on qualitative rather than quantitative data, smaller communities, and symbolic aspects of culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt; Thus it reflects a turn away, in the 1960s, in [[Marxist historiography]] from 'the orthodox Marxist approach to human behaviour in which actors are seen as motivated in the first instance by economics, and only secondarily by culture or ideology', in the work of historians such as [[E. P. Thompson]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt;

Historical anthropology was rooted in the [[Annales School]], associated with a succession of major historians such as [[Fernand Braudel]], [[Jacques Le Goff]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] and [[Pierre Nora]], along with researchers from elsewhere on the Continent such as [[Carlo Ginzburg]]. The label ''historical anthropology'' has been actively promoted by some recent Annales School historians, such as [[Jean-Claude Schmitt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Claude Schmitt |url=https://cem.revues.org/8862 |title=Anthropologie historique |publisher=Cem.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://acrh.revues.org/1926 |title=L’anthropologie historique de l’Occident médiéval. Un parcours |publisher=Acrh.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1929 by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]], the review [[Annales. Histoire, Sciences sociales]] is still among the most influential French publications for research in historical anthropology.

Historical anthropology has been open to similar criticisms to anthropology: 'as [[Bernard Cohn (anthropologist)|Bernard Cohn]] and [[John Comaroff|John]] and [[Jean Comaroff]] have observed, studies in which societies were represented in this way were often partial, biased, and unwitting handmaidens to the domination of non-Western peoples by Europeans and Americans'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt; But since the Second World War, increasingly reflexive approaches have led to sophisticated developments of the field, and the banner of 'historical anthropology' has often attracted Anglo-American historians in ways that the Annales School did not: key figures have been [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Jay O'Brien (anthropologist)|Jay O'Brien]], [[William Roseberry]], [[Marshall Sahlins]], [[Jane Schneider]], [[Peter Schneider (historian)|Peter Schneider]], [[Eric Wolf]], [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]], and people from elsewhere in the world such as [[Aaron Gurevich]].

'''Hogging''' or '''sweat hogging''' refers to the practice of groups of men who target [[overweight]] or [[obese]] women, typically for sexual encounters. Unlike [[fat fetishism|fat fetishists]], men who participate in hogging are not necessarily sexually attracted to obese women's bodies; they aim to take advantage of a female's [[stereotype|stereotypical]] low [[self-esteem]] or to derive amusement for themselves and their friends by engaging in sexual activities with women who are overweight.

== Practice ==
The social practice can be undertaken as an individual or group activity, and often includes excessive [[Alcohol intoxication|alcohol consumption]], [[emotional detachment]], and degradation of the woman. Hogging does not always include [[sexual intercourse]], and often other sexual activities are the end goal. Participation sometimes includes making bets among male peers, as well as humiliating the woman involved.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web

== Criticism ==
Hogging has been described as a form of [[misogyny]], and as part of culturally-sanctioned abuse of women in the [[United States]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|title="Knocking off a Fat Girl:" An Exploration of Hogging, Male Sexuality, and Neutralizations|date=|url=|year=2006|last1=Gailey|last2=Prohaska|first1=Jeannine|first2=Ariane|authorlink1=|authorlink2=|journal=[[Deviant Behavior (journal)|Deviant Behavior]]|volume=27|issue=1|pages=31–49|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the activity has also been observed in Australia.&lt;ref name="McShaneWilliams2007"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWas8uhuEZIC&amp;pg=PA90|title=Youth Violence and Delinquency &amp;#91;Three Volumes&amp;#93;|author1=Marilyn D.

Williams|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-08204-7|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donna Jarrell, lecturer at [[Ohio State University]] and author of ''What Are You Looking At?: the First Fat Fiction Anthology,'' described hogging as a "sad" practice, saying that it reveals how "our attraction or our revulsion to fat has a lot to do with our culture". She commented that the fat [[Social stigma|stigma]] is so extreme that even men who are genuinely attracted to overweight women cannot admit or discuss their feelings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The practice has also been suggested as a manifestation of [[hypermasculinity]], in which men who do not fit into normative expectations of manhood exhibit insecurity, defensiveness, and sexual aggression to make up for their incapacity to meet masculine standards. In this manner, hogging is described as a form of [[sexual predation]] in which sex is an act of conquest, not intimacy.&lt;ref name="McShaneWilliams2007" /&gt;

'''Human systems engineering''' ('''HSE''') is a field based on [[systems theory]] intended as a structured approach to influence the intangible reality in organizations in a desirable direction. HSE claims to turn complexity into an advantage, to ease innovation processes in organizations and to master problems rooted in negative emotions and lack of motivation. It is taught in a Master of Advanced Studies program of the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland (HES-SO) as a complementary and postgraduate program for students who have already achieved a bachelor level or an MBA.

Recently, after the crisis of the Swiss banking system due to [[whistle blowing]] and to the stealing and selling to intelligence services of sensitive data by bank personnel, numerous articles featured "human risks" as a major problem in organisations. According to [[:de:Lutz von Rosenstiel]]&lt;ref&gt;von Rosenstiel L., Nerdinger F., Spiess E., Was morgen alles anders läuft, Econ Verlag 1991&lt;/ref&gt; the "lack of meaning" and conflicts between personal and organisational values systems is becoming increasingly a problem; people have not any more the feeling to "belong" to an organization if every relation is to be seen as a commercial interaction. [[Chris Argyris]] sees the same problem from the point of view of learning interactions between the organization and personnel, where the organization expects from its personnel to learn in order to fulfil jobs, but the organization is not prepared to learn from its personnel through [[double-loop learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Argyris C., Organizational Learning II. Theory, Method and Practice, Addison-Wesley Pub. Co, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

To handle these issues, in HSE, the organization is seen as a living system according to [[Living systems#Miller's living systems theory|J.G. Millers theory of open and self organizing systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller J.G., ''Living Systems'', McGraw-Hill, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In HSE, the 3 systemic levels "individual", "group" and "organization" are considered as main entities and targets to influence, whereas the levels "society" and "supranational system" supply the criteria for a positive insertion of the organization in its environment. This approach is intended to help managers to understand the organization as a complex and organic system where functional relations, hierarchy and processes are only the visible and tangible part of the "iceberg". HSE claims the invisible part is as important as the tangible and structural aspects of the organizations. HSE sees the invisible as the unconscious part of both the individual and the organization as a collective entity. [[Fritjof Capra]] describes the subtle interactions between the tangible and the invisible in one of his books.&lt;ref&gt;Capra F., The Hidden Connections: A Science for Sustainable Living,Doubleday 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

From an epistemological point of view HSE refers explicitly to [[Edgar Morin]]'s proposal to link sciences and practices &lt;ref&gt;Morin E., Relier les connaissances – Le défi du XXIe siècle, Ed. Seuil 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Jean Piaget]]'s concept of "[[transdisciplinarity]]".

As a result of the program, human risks and the resources deriving from a positive interaction are now better understood.&lt;ref&gt;Dubouloz C., Le bonheur des collaborateurs est un facteur décisif du succès, in Le Temps, 29.04.2005,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloch E. Entreprises: gros protentiels pour les biens intangibles, in AGEFI 04.07.2005,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bodard Senn J., Maîtriser les facteurs humains, in Swiss Engineering, 12–2003,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stöcklin V., L'entreprise, un système vivant, in 24 heures, 20.11.2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baillod G., Le secret des processus humains, in Bilan, 1–2005&lt;/ref&gt; As in a part of the Swiss academic system  ([[Fachhochschule|University of Applied Sciences]]) Master Thesis' include applications of contents and learned skills, HSE is becoming increasingly popular amongst private or public organizations when resolving problems on the intangible side becomes critical for survival or for success. Further, 7 cohorts of students who achieved their master's degree "teach the gospel" in and around Switzerland. 

HSE was first launched in French in 2002 at the University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland and in 2004 at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences in German language.

The program was founded in 2002 by two professors of the university:
* Prof. [[Christa Muth]] PhD,&lt;ref&gt;Dorier R, Muth C., Comment utiliser la complexité – Outils, attitudes et compétences à développer, jobindex media ag, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; who did several years research in organizational psychosociology and was developer of the Leonardo 3.4.5 methodology for strategy analysis in relation with team-members thought patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardo345.com Leonardo 3.4.5]&lt;/ref&gt; Muth was the main conceptor of HSE.
* Prof. Marie-France Bourdais, specialist in communication and coaching, joined the team at an early stage and contributed her experience in using [[Neuro-linguistic-programming]] for modelling human and business processes.

Recently [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] started using the term "Human Systems Engineering" in its Engineering Systems Division, putting the focus on how people and organizations, conceive, develop and handle technological systems. Specialised courses focus on topics such as "The Human Side of Technology" or more human risk oriented courses as for example "Managing Nuclear Technology".

A similar program exists in Canada: [[Human Systems Intervention]].

[[File:Kirikane tools 2.JPG|thumb|''Kirikane'' tools]]
{{nihongo|'''''Kirikane'''''|截金}} is a Japanese decorative technique used for [[Buddhist]] [[statues]] and [[paintings]], using [[gold leaf]], [[silver]] leaf, [[platinum]] leaf cut into [[wikt:line|line]]s, [[diamonds]] and [[triangles]].

==History==
Kirikane was imported from China during the [[Tang dynasty]](618–907). The oldest examples is Tamamushino Zushi at [[Horyuji Temple]]. Kirikane flourished primarily in the 11th century and continued until the 13th or 14th century. After that, however, Kirikane almost disappeared, due to the overall decline of Buddhist art. 

==Technique==
1) Two pieces of leaf (gold or silver, platinum) are heated over an [[Wood ash|ash]]-banked fire and bonded together. An additional bonding is then done to further strengthen the leaf and add thickness.

2) The bonded leaf is cut with [[bamboo]] [[knife]] on a [[deer]]-skin-covered table.

3) The bonded leaf is affixed with glue(seaweed glue, funori and hide glue, nikawa) to the object to be decorated.

{{Buddhism}}
The '''Kurkihar hoard''' represents a rare set of 226 bronzes, mostly Buddhist, dating to between the 9th and 12th centuries CE, which were found in  Kurkihar near [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] in the Indian state of [[Bihar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jais/hd_jais.htm Guy, The "Påala-Sena" Schools of Sculpture, Volume 10 of Studies in South Asian Culture,  The "Pala-Sena" Schools of Sculpture, Susan L. Huntington  Brill Archive, 1984, p. 141]&lt;/ref&gt; The village of Kurkihar is situated about 5&amp;nbsp;km. north-east of Wazirgunj, and 27 km east from [[Gaya, India|Gaya]]. The inscriptions found suggest that Kurkihar was once a well known international pilgrimage center.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bhaskar.com/news/BIH-PAT-HMU-buddhist-archaeological-site-kurkihar-5620721-PHO.html जिद धरोहर बचाने की : गया के कुर्किहार के घर-घर में है धरोहर, विदेशों से था संबंध,  Bhaskar News,  Jun 13, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

These include a gilded [[Avalokiteshvara]] image from 12th century, referred to as being resplendent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkativeman.com/gilt-bronze-statue-bodhisattva-avalokiteshvara/  Resplendent Sculpture of Avalokiteshvara from Kurkihar (Bihar, India) from 12th Century, January 10, 2017, Ellen Kaufman]&lt;/ref&gt;

The monastery where the bronzes were found was named Apanakain in an [[Prajnaparamita#A.E1.B9.A3.E1.B9.ADas.C4.81hasrik.C4.81_Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81|Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita]] manuscript now in  [[LACM]].&lt;ref&gt;A Forgotten Monastery of Ancient Bihar, Pal, Pratapaditya, South Asian studies, Vol:4 No:1 Date: 1988 Pages:83-88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==

Major Kittoe in 1847, he visited the place twice and on the second visit to the village, spent four days collecting "ten cart-loads of images; all Buddhist and the Tamrika period". A great portion of this collection is preserved in the Indian Museum Kolkata.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bhpromo.org.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=71  KURKIHAR, -The remnants of an artistic age, 10 December 2009 20:10]&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham visited Kurkihar in 1861-62 and again in 1879-80. He mentions that the site was about 600 feet square and about 25 feet high. He mentioned having seen here not only numerous Buddhist images, large and small, but a large number of votive stupas. He says there were in his time "row after row of Chaityas extending north to south for several hundred feet".

In 1930 a hoard of 226 bronzes and five other objects was found at Kurkihar, which were unearthed from the main mound. These included  Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Stupas, Bells and ritual objects. Today, these objects are displayed in special room in the Patna Museum.

Of the 87 images, 81 were Buddhist and 6 Brahmanical. They were all found in one spot, with the smaller images enclosed in earthen jars.&lt;ref&gt;S.K. Sarasvati and K.C. Sarkar, Kurkihar, Gaya and Bodh-Gaya, Rajshahi, 1936, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; They were found about 25 feet below the surface of the main mound,  when someone was digging for bricks.

==Major images ==

The Sonnery Kurkihar Buddha was sold for US$ 2,806,390 on 3 Oct 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/24028/lot/16/  THE SONNERY KURKIHAR BUDDHA]&lt;/ref&gt; It is roughly contemporaneous with the Atisha period in Tibet (1st half of the 11th century), which initiated a two-century period when Indian bronzes were collected by Tibetans and served as the models of  their own early styles. The Sonnery Kurkihar Buddha may have been one such image that travelled to Tibet during the [[History_of_Tibet#Tibetan_Renaissance_.2810th-12th_century.29|Tibetan Renaissance]] period.

In 2005, for an exhibition in Australia, two of the three statues representing India were from Kurkihar, they were valued at US $30 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livehindustan.com/news/Gaya/article1-Kurkihar-neglected-Buddhist-site-lies-in-increased-prized-sculptures-653651.html  उपेक्षित है कुर्किहार बौद्ध स्थल, बढ़ में छिपी है बेशकीमती मूर्तियां, Live Hindustan, 4 जनवरी, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscriptions==
Cunningham has written: "I procured several short but interesting inscriptions at Kurkihar. The name of Sakala is mentioned in several of them, and also Kerala in Dakshinades. The age of these inscriptions, judging from the shapes of the letters, must be about A.D. 800 to 1000"&lt;ref&gt;[https://silentpagesindia.blogspot.in/2013/09/visit-to-kurkihar-in-august-2013.html   An ancient legendary site yet to be fully explored and understood, 28th September 2013, Vikas Vaibhav]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ninety three inscriptions have been found on the bronzes.&lt;ref&gt;Banerji-Sastri, "Ninety-three Inscriptions on the Kurkihar Bronzes,  Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, XXVI, 3 (1940), 236-251. &lt;/ref&gt; The Kurkihar inscriptions refer to Devapala (810–c. 850), Rajyapala (908–940), Mahipala (988–c. 1036) and Vigrahapala III (1054–1072), ranging from 9th century to 1074 AD.  The name of the monastery was apparently named Apanaka, which is mentioned in several inscriptions. The monastery was apparently very popular among the visitors from [[Kanchi]] in South India.

The names, places of origin and ranks of the donors for 9-12th century have been analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jocbs.org/index.php/jocbs/article/download/100/120 The socieo-economic dimensions of dedicatory inscriptions, B.N. Prasad, JOBS.2074(7):116-152]&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution is 9th century:14, 10th: 21, 11th: 25, and 12th: 10.

==Manuscript==
A circa 1100-1125 manuscript of [[Prajnaparamita#A.E1.B9.A3.E1.B9.ADas.C4.81hasrik.C4.81_Praj.C3.B1.C4.81p.C4.81ramit.C4.81|Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita]]  now in  [[LACM]].&lt;ref&gt;A Forgotten Monastery of Ancient Bihar, Pal, Pratapaditya, South Asian studies, Vol:4 No:1 Date: 1988 Pages:83-88&lt;/ref&gt; was copied in this monastery during the rule of [[Ramapala]].

==Significance==

Kurkihar was apparently a major pilgrimage center located midway between [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] and [[Rajgriha]] and as well an artistic center of brass and stone sculpting. The inscriptions found  refer to donors not only from distant place in India like Sakala in Punjab, and Kerala, Conjeevaram or Kanchi in the south, but also from Bali Islands, Malaya as well as  other countries. The inscriptions  refer to a number of kings, mostly of the Pala dynasty.

==Comparison with Nalanda bronzes==
[[File:043 Buddha Teaching, Nalanda (9218609395).jpg|thumb|Buddha Teaching, [[Nalanda]] ]]

Kurkihar bronzes have been compared with the bronzes from nearby Nalanda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qCQVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=nalanda+bronzes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZG8OgVa2md&amp;sig=v10TTanrXBuxy8Cs4mxUGYNck34&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix87zom6bXAhXH4IMKHULFDUoQ6AEISTAM#v=onepage&amp;q=kurkihar&amp;f=false The Bronzes of Nalanda and Hindu-javanese Art, A.J. Bernet Kampers, Brill Archive, 1933, p. 19-64]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that Nalanda sculptors may have settled in Kurkihar&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xLA3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=nalanda+kurkihar+bronzes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qmgax54DUI&amp;sig=de0NKi94XGa4OX_BGvrFAh_yzgw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3rfWWsabXAhVi_4MKHZLEB1EQ6AEIRTAK#v=onepage&amp;q=nalanda%20kurkihar%20bronzes&amp;f=false The "Påala-Sena" Schools of Sculpture,Volume 10 of The "Pala-Sena" Schools of Sculpture, Susan L. Huntington, Brill Archive, 1984  p. 5-153]&lt;/ref&gt; Kurkihar bronzes data from 10th to 12th cent while Nalanda bronzes cover the period from 7th to 9th cent. nalanda bronzes are reddish whereas Kurkihar bronzes are more yellow.

==Museums==

Most of the Kurkihar bronzes are in the [[Patna Museum]]. The Hindu temple situated in the north-eastern portion of the village was visited by Cunningham in 1861 where a number of images, both Buddhist and Hindu images,  dated to the 10th - 11th Century AD, have been preserved here.

==Patna Museum theft==

On Sept 26, 2006, 18 bronze images from Kurkihar were stolen from the Patna Museum. The thieves entered through a window by cutting the cutting bars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/18-statues-figurines-of-pala-period-stolen-from-patna-museum/418634   18 statues, figurines of Pala period stolen from Patna museum, Outlook, Sept 26, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The images were later recovered from a gang  including a Vinod Yadav in Nalanda district, and Shahid Warsi of Kolkata. A [[Manjushri]] image was not recovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6038510.stm Priceless Indian statue recovered, BBC,  10 October 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9010">'''Law and religion''' is the interdisciplinary study of relationships between [[law]], especially [[public law]], and [[religion]]. Voge Magazine reports that during the late 1900, a new law and religion approach emerged that progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the [[Journal of Law and Religion]], was first published that year. The ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' began publication in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge University Press [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ecclesiastical-law-journal/all-issues]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rutgers Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in 1999.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.lawandreligion.com/ its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' was founded in England in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;It also sponsors OJLR Summer Academy in Law and Religion 2014, at St Hugh's College, Oxford. see [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. For example, the Brigham Young University law school in 2000 created  "The International Center for Law and Religion Studies." It has an international mission and its annual symposium (which began in 1993) has brought to campus over 1000 scholars, human rights activists, judges from supreme courts, and government ministers dealing with religious affairs from more than 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.iclrs.org/index.php?contentId=433&amp;linkId=156&amp;pageId=1  its website] accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2012, major law and religion organizations in the U.S. included  500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles, according to Emory Law Professor [[John Witte, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research topics==
Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. For example, ''The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion'' seeks to cover:
:social, legal and political issues involving the relationship between law and religion in society; comparative law perspectives on the relationship between religion and state institutions; developments regarding human and constitutional rights to freedom of religion or belief; considerations of the relationship between religious and secular legal systems; empirical work on the place of religion in society; and other salient areas where law and religion interact (e.g., theology, legal and political theory, legal history, philosophy, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://ojlr.oxfordjournals.org/ its website], accessed 2/22/14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics of interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997) &lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008) &lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Elizabeth Mayer, "Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East," ''American Journal of Comparative Law'' (1987) 35#1 pp. 127-184 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/840165 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Asian ancestral religions, occult altercations, pagan Rome and any realm in which religious beliefs form the basis of or contradict governmental law.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Christianity, studies range from textual analysis of early Christians' relationship with Jewish Law, the effect of law on the Protestant Reformation, and modern day issues like homosexual unions, the ordination of women to the diaconate and priesthood, and consciences objectors to war.  

Important studies have appeared regarding [[secularization]].&lt;ref&gt;Silvio Ferrari, "Law and Religion in a Secular World: A European Perspective," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp 355-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Palomino, "Legal dimensions of secularism: challenges and problems," ''Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice'' (2012) vol 2 pp 208-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular the issue of wearing religion symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Karima Bennoune, "Secularism and human rights: A contextual analysis of headscarves, religious expression, and women's equality under international law," ''Columbia Journal of Transnational Law,'' 45 (2006): 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National studies==
===Thailand===
In Thailand, the constitutional monarchy that was established in the 1930s integrated traditional Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion with modern methods of public administration and legal authority. The result was the formation of a unique [[civic religion]] based on the three-way formula of nation, religion, and kingship. This new tradition has evolved and provides a framework for both the symbolic discourse as well as practical actions in modern Thai legal culture.&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Reynolds, "Dhamma in Dispute: The Interactions of Religion and Law in Thailand," ''Law &amp; Society Review'' (1994) 28#3 pp 433-451&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PriestleyHistoryLectures.jpg|right|thumb|Title page from [[Joseph Priestley]]'s ''Lectures'']]

'''''Lectures on History and General Policy''''' (1788) is the published version of a set of lectures on history and government given by the 18th-century British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]] to the students of [[Warrington Academy]].

The ''Lectures'' cover an array of topics—"forms of government, the feudal system, the rise of corporations, law, agriculture, commerce, the arts, finance and taxation, colonies, manners, population, war and peace"—demonstrating how all-encompassing Priestley believed the study of history to be.&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley offers a version of history in which all events are "an exhibition of the ways of God;" studying history and nature, according to Priestley, "leads us to the knowledge of his perfections and of his will."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in McLachlan, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding history thus allows one to comprehend the natural laws God established and the perfection towards which they allow the world to tend. This [[Millennialism|millennial]] outlook is tied together with Priestley's belief in scientific progress and the improvement of the human race. Priestley maintained that each age improves upon the previous and studying history allows people to see and participate in that progress.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley's millennial conception of history was in direct contrast to the two dominant historical paradigms of the time: [[Edward Gibbon]]'s decline narrative found in the ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' and [[David Hume]]'s cyclical narrative found in his ''[[History of England (Hume)|History of England]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical underpinning of Priestley's [[millennialism|millennial]] view of history was [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley's]] theory of association laid out in ''[[Observations on Man]]'' (1749). Hartley's [[Association of Ideas|associationism]], an expansion of [[John Locke]]'s theories in ''[[Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690, postulated that the human mind operated according to natural laws and that the most important law for the formation of the self was "associationism." For Hartley, associationism was a physical process: vibrations in the physical world travelled through the nerves attached to people's sense organs and ended up in their brains. The brain connected the vibrations of whatever sensory input it was receiving with whatever feelings or ideas that the brain was simultaneously "thinking." These "associations" were impossible to avoid, formed as they were simply by experiencing the world; they were also the foundation of a person's character. Locke famously warns against letting "a foolish maid" convince a child that "goblins and sprites" are associated with the darkness, for "darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other."&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. Ed. [[Roger Woolhouse]]. New York: Penguin Books (1997), 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Associationism provided the scientific basis for Priestley's belief that man is "perfectible" and served as the foundation for all of his pedagogical innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 87; 93; Sheps, 137-9; 147-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Priestley viewed education as one of the primary forces shaping a person's character as well as the basis of morality, he, unusually for his time, promoted the education of women. Alluding to the language of Locke's ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'', he wrote: "certainly, the minds of women are capable of the same improvement, and the same furniture, as those of men."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Watts, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that if women were to care for children and be intellectually stimulating companions for their husbands, they had to be well-educated. Although Priestley advocated education for middle-class women, he did not extend this logic to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley also presented a method for historical research and was one of the first to argue for the primacy of original documents in the study of history. He contended that much could be learned from "material evidence" of former civilisations, such as "ancient coins, medals and inscriptions," as well as "exchequer rolls, public and private ledger books, letters, diaries, monetary, financial and exchange systems, systems of fortifications and city plans . . . [in addition to] ballads and works of fiction."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 254-5; McLachlan, 256; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lectures'' was well received and was employed by many educational institutions, such as the Dissenting academy at Hackney,&lt;!-- Is New College at Hackney the same as [[Homerton College, Cambridge]]? --&gt; [[Brown University|Brown]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 259; Sheps, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Annual Review of Anthropology'', ''37'', 53-73&lt;/ref&gt; designed to study the diversity of life history strategies used by different organisms throughout the world, as well as the causes and results of the variation in their life cycles.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Flatt, T., &amp; Heyland, A. (Eds.). (2011). Mechanisms of Life History Evolution : The Genetics and Physiology of Life History Traits and Trade-Offs. Oxford, GB: OUP Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a theory of biological [[evolution]] that seeks to explain aspects of organisms' anatomy and behavior by reference to the way that their life histories—including their reproductive development and behaviors, life span and post-reproductive behavior—have been shaped by [[natural selection]]. A life history strategy is the "age- and stage-specific patterns"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and timing of events that make up an organism's life, such as birth, weaning, maturation, death, etc.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Ahlström, T. (2011). Life‐history theory, past human populations and climatic perturbations. ''International Journal of Osteoarchaeology'', ''21''(4), 407-419.&lt;/ref&gt; These events, notably [[juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] development, age of [[sexual maturity]], first reproduction, number of offspring and level of [[parental investment]], [[senescence]] and death, depend on the physical and ecological environment of the organism.

The theory was developed in the 1950s&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Stearns, S. (1992). ''The Evolution of Life Histories''. Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to answer questions about topics such as organism size, age of maturation, number of offspring, life span, and many others.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Hochberg, Z. (2011). Evo-Devo of Child Growth : Treatise on Child Growth and Human Evolution (1). Hoboken, US: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to study these topics, life history strategies must be identified, and then models are constructed to study their effects. Finally, predictions about the importance and role of the strategies are made,&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Stearns, S. (1976). Life-History Tactics: A Review of the Ideas. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology,'' ''51''(1), 3-47. {{jstor|2825234}}&lt;/ref&gt; and scientists use these predictions to understand how evolution affects the ordering and length of life history events in an organism's life, particularly the lifespan and period of reproduction.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Hill, K., &amp; Kaplan, H. (1999). Life history traits in humans: Theory and empirical studies. ''Annual Review Of Anthropology'', ''28''(1), 397.&lt;/ref&gt; Life history theory draws on an evolutionary foundation, and studies the effects of natural selection on organisms, both throughout their lifetime and across generations.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Bolger, D. (Ed.). (2012). Wiley Blackwell Companions to Anthropology Ser. : A Companion to Gender Prehistory (1). Somerset, US: Wiley-Blackwell. &lt;/ref&gt; It also uses measures of [[evolutionary fitness]] to determine if organisms are able to maximize or optimize this fitness,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Preston, S. D., Kringelbach, M. L., &amp; Knutson, B. (2014). The Interdisciplinary Science of Consumption. Cambridge, US: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; by allocating resources to a range of different demands throughout the organism's life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It serves as a method to investigate further the "many layers of complexity of organisms and their worlds".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Morbeck, M., Galloway, A., &amp; Zihlman, A. ''The Evolving Female : A Life-history Perspective''. (1997). Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisms have evolved a great variety of life histories, from [[Pacific salmon]], which produce thousands of eggs at one time and then die, to human beings, who produce a few offspring over the course of decades.  The theory depends on principles of [[evolutionary biology]] and [[ecology]] and is widely used in other areas of science.

== Brief history of field ==
Life history theory is seen as a branch of [[evolutionary ecology]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and is used in a variety of different fields. Beginning in the 1950s, [[mathematical analysis]] became an important aspect of research regarding LHT.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Roff, D. (2002). ''Life History Evolution''. Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main focuses that have developed over time: genetic and [[phenotypic]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but there has been a recent movement towards combining these two approaches.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Life cycle ==
All organisms follow a specific sequence in their development,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; beginning with [[gestation]] and ending with death, which is known as the life cycle. Events in between usually include [[birth]], [[childhood]], [[developmental biology|maturation]], [[reproduction]], and [[senescence]], and together these comprise the life history strategy of that organism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The major events in this [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] are usually shaped by the demographic qualities of the organism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Some are more obvious shifts than others, and may be marked by physical changes—for example, [[tooth eruption|teeth erupting]] in young children.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Some events may have little variation between individuals in a species, such as length of gestation, but other events may show a lot of variation between individuals,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; such as age at first reproduction.

Life cycles can be divided into two major stages: growth and reproduction. These two cannot take place at the same time, so once reproduction has begun, growth usually ends.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This shift is important because it can also affect other aspects of an organism's life, such as the organization of its group or its [[social interaction]]s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Each species has its own pattern and timing for these events, often known as its [[ontogeny]], and the variety produced by this is what LHT studies.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Hawkes K., ed''. The Evolution of Human Life History''. (2006). Santa Fe : Oxford: School of American Research ; James Currey. Gen ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution then works upon these stages to ensure that an organism adapts to its environment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, a human, between being born and reaching [[adulthood]], will pass through an assortment of life stages, which include: birth, infancy, [[weaning]], childhood and growth, [[adolescence]], [[sexual maturation]], and reproduction.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; All of these are defined in a specific biological way, which is not necessarily the same as the way that they are commonly used.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Darwinian fitness ==
In the context of evolution, fitness is determined by the number of descendents an organism produces over the course of its life. The main elements are survivorship and reproductive rate.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This means that the organism's traits and gene are carried on into future generations, and contribute to  evolutionary "success". The process of adaptation contributes to this "success" by impacting rates of survival and reproduction,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; which in turn establishes an organism's level of Darwinian fitness.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In life history theory, evolution works on the life stages of organisms and creates adaptation—this process establishes fitness.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Life history traits ==
There are seven traits that are traditionally recognized as important in life history theory.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The trait that is seen as the most important for any given organism is the one where a change in that trait creates the most significant difference in that organism's level of fitness. In this sense, an organism's fitness is determined by its changing life history traits.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The way in which evolutionary forces act on these life history traits serves to limit the genetic variability and heritability of the life history strategies,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; although there are still large varieties that exist in the world.

=== List of traits ===
# size at birth
# growth pattern
# age and size at maturity
# number, size, and sex ratio of offspring
# age- and size-specific reproductive investments
# age- and size-specific mortality schedules
# length of life

== Life history strategies ==
Combinations of these life history traits and life events create the life history strategies. As an example, Winemiller and Rose, as cited by Lartillot &amp; Delsuc, propose three types of life history strategies in the fish they study: opportunistic, periodic, and equilibrium.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Lartillot, N., &amp; Delsuc, F. (2012). JOINT RECONSTRUCTION OF DIVERGENCE TIMES AND LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION IN PLACENTAL MAMMALS USING A PHYLOGENETIC COVARIANCE MODEL. ''Evolution,'' ''66''(6), 1773-1787.{{jstor|41503481}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of strategies are defined by the body size of the fish, age at maturation, high or low survivorship, and the type of environment they are found in. So, a fish with a small body size, a late age of maturation, and low survivorship, found in a seasonal environment, would be classified as having a periodic life strategy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The type of behaviors taking place during life events can also define life history strategies. For example, an exploitative life history strategy would be one where an organism benefits by using more resources than others, or by taking these resources from other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, J., &amp; McCrea, S. (2016). Life history theory and exploitative strategies. ''Evolutionary Psychology'', ''14''(3),&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life history characteristics ==
Life history characteristics are traits that affect the [[life table]] of an organism, and can be imagined as various investments in growth, reproduction, and survivorship.

The goal of life history theory is to understand the variation in such life history strategies. This knowledge can be used to construct models to predict what kinds of traits will be favoured in different environments. Without constraints, the highest fitness would belong to a [[Darwinian Demon]], a hypothetical organism for whom such trade-offs do not exist. The key to life history theory is that there are limited resources available, and focusing on only a few life history characteristics is necessary.

Examples of some major life history characteristics include:
* Age at first reproductive event
* Reproductive lifespan and ageing
* Number and size of offspring

Variations in these characteristics reflect different allocations of an individual's resources (i.e., time, effort, and energy expenditure) to competing life functions. For any given individual, available resources in any particular environment are finite. Time, effort, and energy used for one purpose diminishes the time, effort, and energy available for another.

For example, birds with larger broods are unable to afford more prominent [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gustafsson, L., Qvarnström, A., and Sheldon, B.C.  1995.  Trade-offs between life-history traits and a secondary sexual character in male collared flycatchers. Nature 375, 311—313&lt;/ref&gt; Life history characteristics will, in some cases, change according to the population density, since genotypes with the highest fitness at high population densities will not have the highest fitness at low population densities.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, L.D., Guo, P., and Ayala, F.J. 1991. Density dependent natural selection and trade-offs in life history traits. Science, 253: 433-435.&lt;/ref&gt; Other conditions, such as the stability of the environment, will lead to selection for certain life history traits. Experiments by [[Michael R. Rose]] and [[Brian Charlesworth]] showed that unstable environments select for flies with both shorter lifespans and higher fecundity—in unreliable conditions, it is better for an organism to breed early and abundantly than waste resources promoting its own survival.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, M. and Charlesworth, B.

Biological [[tradeoffs]] also appear to characterize the life histories of [[viruses]], including [[bacteriophages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.4161/bact.28365| pmid = 24616839| title = Tradeoffs in bacteriophage life histories| journal = Bacteriophage| volume = 4| issue = 1| pages = e28365| year = 2014| last1 = Keen | first1 = E.

=== Reproductive value and costs of reproduction ===

[[Reproductive value (population genetics)|Reproductive value]] models the tradeoffs between reproduction, growth, and survivorship. An organism's reproductive value (RV) is defined as its expected contribution to the population through both current and future reproduction:&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, R. A. 1930. The genetical theory of natural selection. Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

:RV = Current Reproduction + Residual Reproductive Value (RRV)

The residual reproductive value represents an organism's future reproduction through its investment in growth and survivorship. The cost-of-reproduction hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jasienska|first=Grazyna|date=2009-07-01|title=Reproduction and lifespan: Trade-offs, overall energy budgets, intergenerational costs, and costs neglected by research|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|language=en|volume=21|issue=4|pages=524–532|doi=10.1002/ajhb.20931|issn=1520-6300}}&lt;/ref&gt; predicts that higher investment in current reproduction hinders growth and survivorship and reduces future reproduction, while investments in growth will pay off with higher fecundity (number of offspring produced) and reproductive episodes in the future. This cost-of-reproduction tradeoff influences major life history characteristics. For example, a 2009 study by J. Creighton, N. Heflin, and M. Belk on burying beetles provided "unconfounded support" for the costs of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;J. Curtis Creighton, Nicholas D. Heflin, and Mark C. Belk. 2009. Cost of Reproduction, Resource Quality, and Terminal Investment in a Burying Beetle. The American Naturalist, 174:673–684.&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that beetles that had allocated too many resources to current reproduction also had the shortest lifespans. In their lifetimes, they also had the fewest reproductive events and offspring, reflecting how over-investment in current reproduction lowers residual reproductive value.

The related terminal investment hypothesis describes a shift to current reproduction with higher age. At early ages, RRV is typically high, and organisms should invest in growth to increase reproduction at a later age. As organisms age, this investment in growth gradually increases current reproduction. However, when an organism grows old and begins losing physiological function, mortality increases while fecundity decreases. This [[senescence]] shifts the reproduction tradeoff towards current reproduction: the effects of aging and higher risk of death make current reproduction more favorable. The burying beetle study also supported the terminal investment hypothesis: the authors found beetles that bred later in life also had increased brood sizes, reflecting greater investment in those reproductive events.&lt;ref&gt;J. Curtis Creighton, Nicholas D. Heflin, and Mark C. Belk.  2009.  Cost of Reproduction, Resource Quality, and Terminal Investment in a Burying Beetle. The American Naturalist, 174:673–684.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''r''/''K'' selection theory ===
{{Further|r/K selection theory}}

The selection pressures that determine the reproductive strategy, and therefore much of the life history, of an organism can be understood in terms of [[r/K selection theory]].  The central trade-off to life history theory is the number of offspring vs. the timing of reproduction.  Organisms that are r-selected have a high growth rate (''r'') and tend to produce a high number of offspring with minimal parental care; their lifespans also tend to be shorter.  ''r''-selected organisms are suited to life in an unstable environment, because they reproduce early and abundantly and allow for a low survival rate of offspring.  ''K''-selected organisms subsist near the carrying capacity of their environment (''K''), produce a relatively low number of offspring over a longer span of time, and have high [[parental investment]].  They are more suited to life in a stable environment in which they can rely on a long lifespan and a low mortality rate that will allow them to reproduce multiple times with a high offspring survival rate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen C. Stearns|Stearns, S.C.]]  1977.  The Evolution of Life History Traits: A Critique of the Theory and a Review of the Data.  Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics, 8: 145-171&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organisms that are very ''r''-selected are [[semelparous]], only reproducing once before they die.  Semelparous organisms may be short-lived, like annual crops.  However, some semelparous organisms are relatively long-lived, such as the African flowering plant ''[[Lobelia telekii]]'' which spends up to several decades growing an [[inflorescence]] that blooms only once before the plant dies,&lt;ref&gt;Young, Truman P.  1984.  The Comparative Demography of Semelparous Lobelia Telekii and Iteroparous Lobelia Keniensis
on Mount Kenya.  Journal of Ecology, 72: 637–650&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[periodical cicada]] which spends 17 years as a larva before emerging as an adult.  Organisms with longer lifespans are usually [[iteroparous]], reproducing more than once in a lifetime.  However, iteroparous organisms can be more ''r''-selected than ''K''-selected, such as a [[sparrow]], which gives birth to several chicks per year but lives only a few years, as compared to a [[wandering albatross]], which first reproduces at ten years old and breeds every other year during its 40-year lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, Robert E.  1977.  On the Evolution of Reproductive Strategies in Birds: Reproductive Effort.  The American Naturalist, 111: 453–478.&lt;/ref&gt;

''r''-selected organisms usually:

* mature rapidly and have an early age of first reproduction
* have a relatively short lifespan
* have a large number of offspring at a time, and few reproductive events, or are semelparous
* have a high mortality rate and a low offspring survival rate
* have minimal parental care/investment

''K''-selected organisms usually:

* mature more slowly and have a later age of first reproduction
* have a longer lifespan
* have few offspring at a time and more reproductive events spread out over a longer span of time
* have a low mortality rate and a high offspring survival rate
* have high parental investment

=== Variation ===
Variation is a major part of what LHT studies, because every organism has its own life history strategy. Differences between strategies can be minimal or great.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, one organism may have a single offspring while another may have hundreds. Some species may live for only a few hours, and some may live for decades. Some may reproduce dozens of times throughout their lifespan, and others may only reproduce one or twice.

=== Trade-offs ===
An essential component of studying life history strategies is identifying the trade-offs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/trade-offs_and_constraints/story.htm|title=105_2013_12_05_Trade-offs_1|author=|date=|website=idea.ucr.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; that take place for any given organism. Energy use in life history strategies is regulated by thermodynamics and the conservation of energy,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and the "inherent scarcity of resources",&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; so not all traits or tasks can be invested in at the same time. Thus, organisms must choose between tasks, such as growth, reproduction, and survival,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; prioritizing some and not others. For example, there is a trade-off between maximizing body size and maximizing lifespan, and between maximizing offspring size and maximizing offspring number.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This is also sometimes seen as a choice between quantity and quality of offspring.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These choices are the trade-offs that life history theory studies.

One significant trade off is between [[somatic effort]] (towards growth and maintenance of the body) and reproductive effort (towards producing offspring).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Since an organism can't put energy towards doing these simultaneously, many organisms have a period where energy is put just toward growth, followed by a period where energy is focused on reproduction, creating a separation of the two in the life cycle.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Thus, the end of the period of growth marks the beginning of the period of reproduction. Another fundamental trade-off associated with reproduction is between [[mating effort]] and [[parental effort|parenting effort]]. If an organism is focused on raising its offspring, it cannot devote that energy to pursuing a mate.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

An important trade-off in the dedication of resources to breeding has to do with predation risk: organisms that have to deal with an increased risk of predation often invest less in breeding. This is because it is not worth as much to invest a lot in breeding when the benefit of such investment is uncertain.&lt;ref name="DillonConway2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dillon|first1=Kristen G|last2=Conway|first2=Courtney J|last3=Skelhorn|first3=John|title=Nest predation risk explains variation in avian clutch size|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=29|issue=2|year=2018|pages=301–311|issn=1045-2249|doi=10.1093/beheco/arx130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These trade-offs, once identified, can then be put into models that estimate their effects on different life history strategies and answer questions about the selection pressures that exist on different life events.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Over time, there has been a shift in how these models are constructed. Instead of focusing on one trait and looking at how it changed, scientists are looking at these trade-offs as part of a larger system, with complex inputs and outcomes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Constraints ===
The idea of constraints is closely linked to the idea of trade-offs discussed above. Because organisms have a finite amount of energy, the process of trade-offs acts as a natural limit on the organism's adaptations and potential for fitness. This occurs in populations as well.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These limits can be physical, developmental, or historical, and they are imposed by the existing traits of the organism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Optimizing fitness ===
Optimizing fitness is the idea that an organism can adapt in order to achieve an "optimal" life history strategy that allows it the highest level of fitness possible. There are several methods from which to approach the study of optimality, including energetic and demographic.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Achieving optimal fitness also encompasses multiple generations, because the optimal use of energy includes both the parents and the offspring.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; For example, "optimal investment in offspring is where the decrease in total number of offspring is equaled by the increase of the number who survive".&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Optimality is important for the study of life history theory because it serves as the basis for many of the models used, which work from the assumption that [[natural selection]], as it works on a life history traits, is moving towards the most optimal group of traits and use of energy.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This base assumption, that over the course of its life span an organism is aiming for optimal energy use,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; then allows scientists to test other predictions. However, actually gaining this optimal life history strategy cannot be guaranteed for any organism.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Allocation of resources ===
An organism's allocation of resources ties into several other important concepts, such as trade-offs and optimality. The best possible allocation of resources is what allows an organism to achieve an optimal life history strategy and obtain the maximum level of fitness,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and making the best possible choices about how to allocate energy to various trade-offs contributes to this. Models of resource allocation have been developed and used to study problems such as parental involvement, the length of the learning period for children, and other developmental issues.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The allocation of resources also plays a role in variation, because the different resource allocations by different species create the variety of life history strategies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Capital and income breeding===
{{Further|Capital and income breeding}}
The division of capital and income breeding focuses on how organisms use resources to finance breeding,&lt;ref name="HoustonStephens2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Houston|first1=Alasdair I.|last2=Stephens|first2=Philip A.|last3=Boyd|first3=Ian L.|last4=Harding|first4=Karin C.|last5=McNamara|first5=John M.|title=Capital or income breeding? A theoretical model of female reproductive strategies|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=18|issue=1|year=2007|pages=241–250|issn=1465-7279|doi=10.1093/beheco/arl080}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how they time it.&lt;ref name="DrentDaan1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Drent|first1=R. H.|last2=Daan|first2=S.|title=The prudent parent: energetic adjustments in avian breeding|journal=Ardea|volume=38-90|year=1980|pages=225–252|issn=0373-2266|doi=10.5253/arde.v68.p225}}&lt;/ref&gt; In capital breeders, resources collected before breeding are used to pay for it,&lt;ref name="HoustonStephens2007"/&gt; and they breed once they reach a body-condition threshold, which decreases as the season progresses.&lt;ref name="DrentDaan1980"/&gt; Income breeders, on the other hand, breed using resources that are generated concurrently with breeding,&lt;ref name="HoustonStephens2007"/&gt; and time that using the rate of change in body-condition relative to multiple fixed thresholds.&lt;ref name="DrentDaan1980"/&gt; This distinction, though, is not necessarily a dichotomy; instead, it is a spectrum, with pure capital breeding lying on one end, and pure income breeding on the other.&lt;ref name="HoustonStephens2007"/&gt;

Capital breeding is more often seen in organisms that deal with strong seasonality. This is because when offspring value is low, yet food is abundant, building stores to breed from allows these organisms to achieve higher rates of reproduction than they otherwise would have.&lt;ref name="EjsmondVarpe2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ejsmond|first1=Maciej Jan|last2=Varpe|first2=Øystein|last3=Czarnoleski|first3=Marcin|last4=Kozłowski|first4=Jan|title=Seasonality in offspring value and trade-offs with growth explain capital breeding|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=186|issue=5|year=2015|pages=E111–E125|issn=0003-0147|doi=10.1086/683119}}&lt;/ref&gt; In less seasonal environments, income breeding is likely to be favoured because waiting to breed would not have fitness benefits.&lt;ref name="SainmontAndersen2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sainmont|first1=Julie|last2=Andersen|first2=Ken H.|last3=Varpe|first3=Øystein|last4=Visser|first4=André W.|title=Capital versus income breeding in a seasonal environment|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=184|issue=4|year=2014|pages=466–476|issn=0003-0147|doi=10.1086/677926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phenotypic plasticity ===
Phenotypic plasticity focuses on the concept that the same genotype can produce different phenotypes in response to different environments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It affects the levels of genetic variability because by serving as a source of variation and integration of fitness traits.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Determinants of life history==
Many factors can determine the evolution of an organism's life history, especially the unpredictability of the environment.  A very unpredictable environment—one in which resources, hazards, and competitors may fluctuate rapidly—selects for organisms that produce more offspring earlier in their lives, because it is never certain whether they will survive to reproduce again.  Mortality rate may be the best indicator of a species' life history:  organisms with high mortality rates—the usual result of an unpredictable environment—typically mature earlier than those species with low mortality rates, and give birth to more offspring at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Promislow, D.E.L. and P.H. Harvey. 1990.  Living fast and dying young: A comparative analysis of life-history variation among mammals.  Journal of Zoology, 220:417-437.&lt;/ref&gt;  A highly unpredictable environment can also lead to plasticity, in which individual organisms can shift along the spectrum of r-selected vs. K-selected life histories to suit the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Baird, D. G., L. R. Linton and Ronald W. Davies.  1986.  Life-History Evolution and Post-Reproductive Mortality Risk.  ''Journal of Animal Ecology'' 55: 295-302.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human life history ==
In studying humans, life history theory is used in many ways, including in [[biology]], [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[anthropology]], and other fields.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mittal, C., Griskevicius, V., Simpson, J., &amp; Kawakami, K. (2014). Sense of control under uncertainty depends on people's childhood environment: A life history theory approach. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', ''107''(4), 621-637.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, D., &amp; Rhode, P. (2013). The human polygyny index and its ecological correlates: Testing sexual selection and life history theory at the cross‐national level. ''Social Science Quarterly'', ''94''(4), 1159-1184.&lt;/ref&gt; For humans, life history strategies include all the usual factors—trade-offs, constraints, reproductive effort, etc—but also includes a culture factor that allows them to solve problems through cultural means in addition to through adaptation.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Humans also have unique traits that make them stand out from other organisms, such as a large brain, later maturity and age of first reproduction,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; a long lifespan,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Kaplan, H., Hill, K., Lancaster, J. and Hurtado, A. M. (2000), A theory of human life history evolution: Diet, intelligence, and longevity. Evol. Anthropol., 9: 156–185. {{doi|10.1002/1520-6505(2000)9:4&lt;156::AID-EVAN5&gt;3.0.CO;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a high level of reproduction, often supported by fathers and older (post-menopausal) relatives.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barton, R., Capellini, I., &amp; Stevens, C. (2011). Maternal investment life histories, and the costs of brain growth in mammals. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,'' ''108''(15), 6169-6174. {{jstor|41126625}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Isler, K., &amp; van Schaik, C. (2012). Allomaternal care, life history and brain size evolution in mammals. ''Journal of Human Evolution'', ''63''(1), 52-63.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of possible explanations for these unique traits. For example, a long juvenile period may have been adapted to support a period of learning the skills needed for successful hunting and foraging.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This period of learning may also explain the longer lifespan, as a longer amount of time over which to use those skills makes the period needed to acquire them worth it.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; [[Cooperative breeding]] and the grandmothering hypothesis have been proposed as the reasons that humans continue to live for many years after they are no longer capable of reproducing.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The large brain allows for a greater learning capacity, and the ability to engage in new behaviors and create new things.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The change in brain size may have been the result of a dietary shift—towards higher quality and difficult to obtain food sources&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;—or may have been driven by the social requirements of group living, which promoted sharing and provisioning.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Recent authors, such as Kaplan, argue that both aspects are probably important.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==Perspectives==
Life history theory has provided new perspectives in understanding many aspects of human reproductive behavior, such as the relationship between [[Income and fertility|poverty and fertility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sinding|first=Steven|title=Population, Poverty, and Economic Development|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1532/3023.full|work=Philosophical Transactions of Biological Sciences|publisher=Royal Society for Biological Sciences|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of statistical predictions have been confirmed by social data {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and there is a large body of scientific literature from studies in experimental [[animal model]]s, and [[Naturalistic observation|naturalistic studies]] among many organisms.

==Criticism==
The claim that long periods of helplessness in young would select for more parenting effort in protecting the young at the same time as high levels of predation would select for less parenting effort is criticized for assuming that absolute chronology would determine direction of selection. This criticism argues that the total amount of predation threat faced by the young has the same effective protection need effect no matter if it comes in the form of a long childhood and far between the natural enemies or a short childhood and closely spaced natural enemies, as different life speeds are subjectively the same thing for the animals and only outwardly looks different. One cited example is that small animals that have more natural enemies would face approximately the same amount of threats and need approximately the same amount of protection at the relative timescale of the animals as large animals with fewer natural enemies that grow more slowly (e.g. that many small carnivores that could not eat even a very young human child could easily eat multiple very young blind [[meerkat]]s). This criticism also argues that when a carnivore eats a batch stored together, there is no significant difference in the chance of one surviving depending on the number of young stored together, concluding that humans do not stand out from many small animals such as [[mice]] in selection for protecting helpless young.&lt;ref&gt;2014"The psychometric assessment of human life history strategy: A meta-analytic construct validation"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2015"Race, monogamy, and other lies they told you: Busting myths about human nature"&lt;/ref&gt;

There is criticism of the claim that [[menopause]] and somewhat earlier age-related declines in female fertility could coevolve with a long term dependency on monogamous male providers who preferred fertile females. This criticism argues that the longer the time the child needed parental investment relative to the lifespans of the species, the higher the percentage of children born would still need parental care when the female was no longer fertile or dramatically reduced in her fertility. These critics argue that unless male preference for fertile females and ability to switch to a new female was annulled, any need for a male provider would have selected against menopause to use her fertility to keep the provider male attracted to her, and that the theory of monogamous fathers providing for their families therefore cannot explain why menopause evolved in humans.&lt;ref&gt;2017"Reproductive Ecology and Human Evolution"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2015"Evolutionary contributions to the study of human fertility"&lt;/ref&gt;

One criticism of the notion of a trade-off between mating effort and parenting effort is that in a species in which it is common to spend much effort on something other than mating, including but not exclusive to parenting, there is less energy and time available for such for the competitors as well, meaning that species-wide reductions in the effort spent at mating does not reduce the ability of an individual to attract other mates. These critics also criticize the dichotomy between parenting effort and mating effort for missing the existence of other efforts that take time from mating, such as survival effort which would have the same species-wide effects.&lt;ref&gt;2016"Monogamy and nonmonogamy: Evolutionary considerations and treatment challenges"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2008"Myths Of Gender: Biological Theories About Women And Men, Revised Edition"&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also criticisms of size and organ trade-offs, including criticism of the claim of a trade-off between body size and longevity that cites the observation of longer lifespans in larger species, as well as criticism of the claim that big brains promoted sociality citing primate studies in which monkeys with large portions of their brains surgically removed remained socially functioning though their technical problem solving deteriorated in flexibility, computer simulations of chimpanzee social interaction showing that it requires no complex cognition, and cases of socially functioning humans with microcephalic brain sizes.&lt;ref&gt;2016"50 Great Myths of Human Evolution: Understanding Misconceptions about Our Origins"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2013"The evolution of human growth"&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Master of Chemistry''' (or '''M.Chem''') [[Academic degree|degree]] is a specific [[Masters degree|master's degree]] for courses in the field of [[Chemistry]].

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the M.Chem degree is an [[undergraduate]] award, available after pursuing a four-year course of study at a [[university]]. It is classed as a level 7 qualification in the [[National Qualifications Framework]].

In Scotland the M.Chem degree is a 5-year course.

==Structure==
In terms of course structure, M.Chem degrees have the same content that is usually seen in other degree programmes, i.e. [[lecture]]s, [[Laboratory|laboratory work]], [[coursework]] and [[exam]]s each year. There are also usually one or more substantial projects undertaken in the fourth year, which may well have [[research]] elements. At the end of the second or third years, there is usually a threshold of academic performance in examinations to be reached to allow progression into the final year. Final results are awarded on the standard [[British undergraduate degree classification]] scale.

'''Musicology''' ({{ety|gre|''μουσική'' (mousikē)|music||''-λογία'' (-logia)|study of}}) is the scholarly analysis and research-based study of [[music]]. Musicology is part of the [[humanities]]. A scholar who participates in musical research is a '''musicologist'''.&lt;ref&gt;John Haines, ''Eight Centuries of Troubadours and Trouvères: The Changing Identity of Medieval Music'' (Cambridge, 2004), '55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For broad treatments, see the entry on "musicology" in [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove's dictionary]], the entry on "Musikwissenschaft" in ''Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', and the classic approach of Adler (1885).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Guido (1885). Umfang, Methode und Ziel der Musikwissenschaft. Vierteljahresschrift für Musikwissenschaft, 1, 5-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, [[historical musicology]] (commonly termed "music history") has been the most prominent sub-discipline of musicology. In the 2010s, historical musicology is one of several large musicology sub-disciplines. Historical musicology, [[ethnomusicology]], and [[systematic musicology]] are approximately equal in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?page=whatisethnomusicol|title=What is Ethnomusicology? - Society for Ethnomusicology|website=The Society for Ethnomusicology|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnomusicology is the study of music in its cultural context. Systematic musicology includes music acoustics, the science and technology of acoustical musical instruments, and the musical implications of physiology, psychology, sociology, philosophy and computing. [[Cognitive musicology]] is the set of phenomena surrounding the computational modeling of music. In some countries, [[music education]] is a prominent sub-field of musicology, while in others it is regarded as a distinct academic field, or one more closely affiliated with [[teacher education]], [[educational research]], and related fields. Like music education, [[music therapy]] is a specialized form of applied musicology which is sometimes considered more closely affiliated with health fields, and other times regarded as part of musicology proper.

==Parent disciplines==
The parent disciplines of musicology include:
* General [[history]]
* [[Cultural studies]]
* [[Philosophy]] (particularly [[aesthetics]] and [[semiotics]])
* [[Ethnology]] and [[cultural anthropology]]
* [[Archeology]] and [[prehistory]]
* [[Psychology]] and [[sociology]]
* [[Physiology]] and [[neuroscience]]
* [[Acoustics]] and [[psychoacoustics]]
* Computer/[[information sciences]] and [[mathematics]]

Musicology also has two central, practically oriented sub-disciplines with no parent discipline: [[performance practice]] and research (sometimes viewed as a form of [[Research#Artistic research|artistic research]]), and the [[music theory|theory]], [[musical analysis|analysis]] and composition of music. The disciplinary neighbors of musicology address other forms of [[art]], [[performance]], [[ritual]] and [[communication]], including the history and theory of the visual and plastic arts and of architecture; [[linguistics]], [[literature]] and [[theater]]; religion and [[theology]]; and sport. Musical knowledge is applied in medicine, [[education]], and [[music therapy]]—which, effectively, are parent disciplines of applied musicology.

==Subdisciplines==

===Historical musicology===
{{Main|Music history}}
[[File:Beethoven opus 101 manuscript.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Historical musicology, which was traditionally the most prominent subdiscipline of musicology, studies the history of music. Central to this study is the examination of historical [[sheet music|scores]], such as this original manuscript sketch by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] for [[Piano Sonata No. 28 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 28]], Movement IV, ''Geschwind, doch nicht zu sehr und mit Entschlossenheit'' ([[Tempo|Allegro]]), in his own handwriting. The piece was completed in 1816.]]
'''Music history''' or '''historical musicology''' is concerned with the composition, performance, reception, and criticism of [[music]] over [[time]]. Historical studies of music are for example concerned with a composer's life and works, the developments of styles and genres, ''e.g.'', baroque concertos, the social function of music for a particular group of people, ''e.g.'', court music, or modes of performance at a particular place and time, ''e.g.'', Johann Sebastian Bach's choir in Leipzig. Like the comparable field of [[art history]], different branches and schools of historical musicology emphasize different types of musical works and approaches to music.  There are also national differences in various definitions of historical musicology.  In theory, "music history" could refer to the study of the history of any type or genre of music, ''e.g.'', the history of [[Music of India|Indian music]] or the history of [[Rock music|rock]]. In practice, these research topics are more often considered within [[ethnomusicology]] (see below) and "historical musicology" is typically assumed to imply Western Art music of the European tradition.

The methods of historical musicology include source studies (especially [[manuscript]] studies), [[Palaeography|paleography]], [[philology]] (especially [[textual criticism]]), style criticism, historiography (the choice of [[historical method]]), musical analysis (analysis of music to find "inner coherence"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Beard, David | author2=Gloag, Kenneth | title=Musicology: The Key Concepts | year=2005 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-31692-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[iconography]]. The application of musical analysis to further these goals is often a part of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be seen in the field of [[music theory]]. Music historians create a number of written products, ranging from journal articles describing their current research, new editions of musical works, [[Biography|biographies]] of composers and other musicians, book-length studies or university textbook chapters or entire textbooks. Music historians may examine issues in a close focus, as in the case of scholars who examine the relationship between [[word]]s and music for a given composer's [[art song]]s. On the other hand, some scholars take a broader view, and assess the place of a given type of music, such as the [[symphony]] in [[society]] using techniques drawn from other fields, such as economics, sociology, or philosophy.

''[[New musicology]]'' is a term applied since the late 1980s to a wide body of work emphasizing [[cultural studies|cultural study]], analysis, and criticism of music. Such work may be based on [[Feminism|feminist]], [[gender studies]], [[queer theory]], or [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial]] theory, or the work of [[Theodor W. Adorno]]. Although New Musicology emerged from within historical musicology, the emphasis on cultural study within the Western art music tradition places New Musicology at the junction between historical, ethnological and sociological research in music.

New musicology was a reaction against traditional historical musicology, which according to [[Susan McClary]], "fastidiously declares issues of musical signification off-limits to those engaged in legitimate scholarship." [[Charles Rosen]], however, retorts that McClary, "sets up, like so many of the 'new musicologists', a [[straw man]] to knock down, the [[dogma]] that music has no meaning, and no political or social significance."&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Rosen | first=Charles | chapter=The New Musicology&lt;!--pp.&amp;nbsp;255–272.--&gt; | title=Critical Entertainments: Music Old and New | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-674-00684-3 | page=264}} "(I doubt that anyone, except perhaps the nineteenth-century critic Hanslick, has ever really believed that, although some musicians have been goaded into proclaiming it by the sillier interpretations of music with which we are often assailed.)"&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many musicologists no longer distinguish between musicology and new musicology, since many of the scholarly concerns once associated with new musicology have now become mainstream, and they feel the term "new" no longer applies.

===Ethnomusicology===
{{Main|Ethnomusicology}}

[[Ethnomusicology]], formerly '''comparative musicology''', is the study of [[music]] in its [[cultural]] context.  It is often considered the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music. [[Jeff Todd Titon]] has called it the study of "people making music". Although it is most often concerned with the study of non-[[Western world|Western]] musics, it also includes the study of Western music from an anthropological or sociological perspective, [[cultural studies]] and [[sociology]] as well as other disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. Some ethnomusicologists primarily conduct historical studies,&lt;ref&gt;McCollum, Jonathan and Hebert, David, Eds., (2014). ''Theory and Method in Historical Ethnomusicology'' Lanham, MD: Rowman&amp;Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; but the majority are involved in long-term participant observation, or combine ethnographic and historical approaches in their fieldwork. Therefore, ethnomusiological scholarship can be characterized as featuring a substantial, intensive fieldwork component, often involving long-term residence within the community studied.
Closely related to ethnomusiology is the emerging branch of [[sociomusicology]]. For instance, Ko (2011) proposed the hypothesis of "Biliterate and Trimusical" in Hong Kong sociomusicology.&lt;ref&gt;Ko, C. K. S. (2011). ''An analysis of sociomusicology, its issues; and the music and society in Hong Kong''. Hong Kong: Ko Ka Shing. {{ISBN|978-9-881-58021-4}}. This book has been selected for inclusion in the Association for Chinese Music Research Bibliography in 2012, see [http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10524/23174].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular music studies===
 &lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Popular musicology]] --&gt;

Popular music studies, known, "misleadingly,"&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Allan, ed. (2003). ''Analyzing Popular Music'', p.&amp;nbsp;2. {{ISBN|978-0-521-77120-7}}. p.&amp;nbsp;2n2 reads: "'Popular musicology' should be read as the musicological investigation of popular music, rather than the accessible investigation of music!"&lt;/ref&gt; as ''popular musicology'', emerged in the 1980s as an increasing number of musicologists, ethnomusicologists, and other varieties of historians of American and European culture began to write about popular musics past and present. The first journal focusing on popular music studies was [https://web.archive.org/web/20080411140144/http://www.cambridge.org/journals/journal_catalogue.asp?mnemonic=pmu Popular Music], which began publication in 1981. The same year an academic society solely devoted to the topic was formed, the [http://www.iaspm.net/ International Association for the Study of Popular Music]. The Association's founding was partly motivated by the interdisciplinary agenda of popular musicology though the group has been characterized by a polarized 'musicological' and 'sociological' approach also typical of popular musicology.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music theory, analysis and composition===
{{Main|Music theory}}

'''Music theory''' is a field of study that describes the elements of [[music]] and includes the development and application of methods for composing and for analyzing music through both [[musical notation|notation]] and, on occasion, musical sound itself.  Broadly, theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music ([[Benjamin Boretz|Boretz]], 1995).  A person who studies or practices music theory is a '''music theorist'''.

Some music theorists attempt to explain the techniques composers use by establishing rules and patterns.  Others model the experience of listening to or performing music.  Though extremely diverse in their interests and commitments, many Western music theorists are united in their belief that the acts of composing, performing, and listening to music may be explicated to a high degree of detail (this, as opposed to a conception of musical expression as fundamentally ineffable except in musical sounds). Generally, works of music theory are both descriptive and prescriptive, attempting both to define practice and to influence later practice.  Thus, music theory generally lags behind practice but also points towards future exploration, composition, and performance.

Musicians study music theory to understand the structural relationships in the (nearly always notated) music. Composers study music theory to understand how to produce effects and structure their own works.  Composers may study music theory to guide their [[precompositional]] and compositional decisions.  Broadly speaking, music theory in the Western tradition focuses on [[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]], and then uses these to explain large scale structure and the creation of [[melody]].

===Music psychology===
{{Main|Music psychology|Cognitive musicology|Cognitive neuroscience of music|Music therapy}}

Music psychology applies the content and methods of all subdisciplines of [[psychology]] ([[perception]], [[cognition]], [[motivation]], etc.) to understand how music is created, perceived, responded to, and incorporated into individuals' and societies' daily lives.&lt;ref name = Tan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harré |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |pages=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary branches include [[cognitive musicology]], which emphasizes the use of computational models for human musical abilities and cognition, and the [[cognitive neuroscience of music]], which studies the way that music perception and production manifests in the brain using the methodologies of [[cognitive neuroscience]]. While aspects of the field can be highly theoretical, much of modern music psychology seeks to optimize the practices and professions of music performance, composition, education, and therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ockelford |first=Adam |chapter=Beyond music psychology |editor1-last=Hallam |editor1-first=Susan |editor2-last=Cross |editor2-first=Ian |editor3-last=Thaut |editor3-first=Michael |title=The Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology |date=2009 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-929845-7 |page=539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance practice and research===
{{Main|Authentic performance}}

Performance practice draws on many of the tools of historical musicology to answer the specific question of how music was performed in various places at various times in the past. Although previously confined to early music, recent research in performance practice has embraced questions such as how the early history of recording affected the use of [[vibrato]] in classical music, or instruments in [[Klezmer]].

Within the rubric of musicology, performance practice tends to emphasize the collection and synthesis of evidence about how music should be performed.  The important other side, learning how to sing authentically or perform a historical instrument is usually part of [[College or university school of music|conservatory]] or other performance training.  However, many top researchers in performance practice are also excellent musicians.

Music performance research (or music performance science) is strongly associated with music psychology. It aims to document and explain the psychological, physiological, sociological and cultural details of how music is actually performed (rather than how it should be performed). The approach to research tends to be systematic and empirical, and to involve the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings of music performance research can often be applied in [[music education]].

==Education and careers==
[[File:Satchmofest07JackStewartSpeaks.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Music historian Jack Stewart lectures at a conference.]]
Musicologists in tenure track professor positions typically hold a [[Ph.D]] in musicology. In the 1960s and 1970s, some musicologists obtained [[professor]] positions with an [[M.A.]] as their highest degree, but in the 2010s, the Ph.D is the [[terminal degree|standard minimum credential]] for [[tenure track]] professor positions. As part of their initial training, musicologists typically complete a [[B.Mus]] or a [[B.A.]] in music (or a related field such as history) and in many cases an [[M.A.]] in musicology. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a Ph.D, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for musicology Ph.D programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus and an M.A. in psychology). In music education, individuals may hold an [[M.Ed]] and an [[Ed.D]].

Most musicologists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in [[college]]s, [[University|universities]] or [[Music school|conservatories]]. The job market for tenure track professor positions is very competitive. Entry-level applicants must hold a completed Ph.D or the equivalent degree and applicants to more senior professor positions must have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some Ph.D-holding musicologists are only able to find insecure positions as [[sessional lecturer]]s. The job tasks of a musicologist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: she teaches undergraduate and/or graduate classes in her area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as [[Music appreciation|Music Appreciation]] or Introduction to Music History), conducts research in her area of expertise, publishes articles about her research in peer-reviewed journals, authors book chapters, books or textbooks, travels to conferences to give talks on her research and learn about research in her field, and, if her program includes a [[graduate school]], supervises M.A. and Ph.D students and gives them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some musicology professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] or [[Chairman|Chair]] of the School of Music.

==Role of women==
[[File:Rosetta Reitz.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Rosetta Reitz]] (1924–2008) was an American [[jazz]] historian who established a record label producing 18 albums of the music of the early women of jazz and the blues.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Martin, Douglas. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/arts/music/15reitz.html "Rosetta Reitz, Champion of Jazz Women, Dies at 84"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 November 2008. Accessed 19 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The vast majority of major musicologists and music historians from past generations have been men, as in the 19th century and early 20th century; women's involvement in teaching music was mainly in [[Women in music education|elementary and secondary music teaching]].&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015) When looking beyond bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "...home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "...as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations."&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. [[Carolyn Abbate]] (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at [[Princeton University]]. She has been described by the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' as "one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians".&lt;ref name=HG&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/abbate-named-university-professor/ "Abbate named University Professor"], ''Harvard Gazette'', 20 November 2013. Accessed 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Susan McClary]] (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "[[New Musicology]]" who incorporates [[feminism|feminist]] music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from [[Harvard University]]. One of her best known works is ''Feminine Endings'' (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of "purely musical" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.

The '''National Wind Tunnel Facility''' (NWTF), is an initiative in which 17 [[wind tunnels]] distributed across seven UK universities (host institutions) are made open access (for up to 25% of time) to external researchers in the UK and abroad, from both university and industry based.&lt;ref&gt;The proposal funding details on the EPSRC website: http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPanel.aspx?PanelId=1-1O6B32&lt;/ref&gt; 

NWTF is intended to be as inclusive as possible while still  supporting the best science. The scheme was announced on 9 January 2014 by [[David Willetts]], Minister for Science and Universities.&lt;ref&gt;News of the opening by the minister David Willetts: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-25668025&lt;/ref&gt; The total funding for the Facility is £13.3 million, £10.7 million coming from [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|EPSRC]] and £2.6 million from the UK Aerospace Technology Institute.&lt;ref&gt; News of the opening on the ATI website: http://www.ati.org.uk/news/uk-aerodynamics-epsrc-fund-national-wind-tunnel-facility-nwtf/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The EPSRC and ATI decided to fund the NWTF in order to match the UK talent base to world-class wind tunnel facilities. The enhanced UK capability in experimental [[aerodynamics]] is available to all UK-based researchers.  The stated aim was to create nodes of excellence attracting young researchers. Another aim was to establish a closer tie with industry, creating a pull-through environment and an intended spill-over of the collaboration and benefits to other sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Details of the project: http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/L024888/1&lt;/ref&gt;

The NWTF programme was to have a duration of five years. A mid-term review was to review the progress made during the first two and a half years. The current end date is December 2018,

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |God}}
{{Atheism sidebar |arguments}}

The '''omnipotence paradox''' is a family of [[paradox]]es that arise with some understandings of the term 'omnipotent'. The paradox arises, for example, if one assumes that an omnipotent being has no limits and is capable of realizing any outcome, even logically contradictory ideas such as creating square circles. A no-limits understanding of omnipotence such as this has been rejected by theologians from  [[Thomas Aquinas]] to contemporary philosophers of religion, such as [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|Alvin Plantinga]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=God, Freedom, and Evil|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1977|isbn=0-8028-1731-9|location=Grand Rapids, MI:|pages=Chapter 4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheological arguments based on the omnipotence paradox are sometimes described as evidence for atheism, though Christian theologians and philosophers, such as [[Norman Geisler]] and [[William Lane Craig]], contend that a no-limits understanding of omnipotence is not relevant to orthodox Christian theology.  Other possible resolutions to the paradox hinge on the definition of omnipotence applied and the nature of God regarding this application and whether or not omnipotence is directed toward God himself or outward toward his external surroundings.

The omnipotence paradox has medieval origins, dating at least to the 12th century. It was addressed by [[Averroës]]&lt;ref name="TT"&gt;[[Averroës]], ''Tahafut al-Tahafut (The Incoherence of the Incoherence)'' trans. Simon Van Den Bergh, Luzac &amp; Company 1969, sections 529–536&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name=TA/&gt; [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (before 532) has a predecessor version of the paradox, asking whether it is possible for God to "deny himself".

The most well-known version of the omnipotence paradox is the so-called ''paradox of the stone'': "Could God create a stone so heavy that even He could not lift it?"&lt;ref name="Savage, C. Wade 1967 pp. 74"&gt;Savage, C. Wade. "The Paradox of the Stone" ''Philosophical Review'', Vol. 76, No. 1 (Jan., 1967), pp. 74–79 {{doi|10.2307/2182966}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phrasing of the omnipotence paradox is vulnerable to objections based on the physical nature of [[gravity]], such as how the [[weight]] of an object depends on what the local gravitational field is. Alternative statements of the paradox that do not involve such difficulties include "If given the axioms of Euclidean geometry, can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles do not add up to 180 degrees?" and "Can God create a prison so secure that he cannot escape from it?".

==Overview==
A common modern version of the omnipotence paradox is expressed in the question: "Can [an omnipotent being] create a stone so heavy that it cannot lift it?" This question generates a dilemma. The being can either create a stone it cannot lift, or it cannot create a stone it cannot lift. If the being ''can'' create a stone that it cannot lift, then it seems that it can cease to be omnipotent. If the being ''cannot'' create a stone it cannot lift, then it seems it is already not omnipotent.&lt;ref name="Savage, C. Wade 1967 pp. 74"/&gt;

A related issue is whether the concept of 'logically possible' is different for a world in which omnipotence exists than a world in which omnipotence does not exist.

The dilemma of omnipotence is similar to another classic paradox—the [[irresistible force paradox]]: ''What would happen if an irresistible force were to meet an immovable object?'' One response to this paradox is to disallow its formulation, by saying that if a force is irresistible, then by definition there is no immovable object; or conversely, if an immovable object exists, then by definition no force can be irresistible. Some claim{{who|date=May 2015}} that the only way out of this paradox is if the irresistible force and immovable object never meet. But this is not a way out, because an object cannot in principle be immovable if a force exists that can in principle move it, regardless of whether the force and the object actually meet.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://curiosity.com/topics/the-omnipotence-paradox-has-puzzled-people-for-centuries-curiosity/|title=The Omnipotence Paradox Has Puzzled People For Centuries|website=curiosity.com|access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--If they are GUARANTEED not to meet then I don't see what the problem is.--&gt;

==Types of omnipotence==
{{Main|Omnipotence}}
[[Peter Geach]] describes and rejects four levels of omnipotence. He also defines and defends a lesser notion of the "almightiness" of God.

#"Y is '''absolutely omnipotent'''" means that "Y" can do anything that can be expressed in a string of words even if it is self-[[contradiction|contradictory]]: "Y" is not bound by the laws of logic."&lt;ref name="Geach"&gt;Geach, P. T. "Omnipotence" 1973 in Philosophy of Religion: Selected Readings, Oxford University Press, 1998, pp. 63–75&lt;/ref&gt;   
#"Y is '''omnipotent'''" means "Y can do X" is true [[if and only if]] X is a logically consistent description of a state of affairs. This position was once advocated by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name=TA&gt;[[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas, Thomas]] [[Summa Theologica]] Book 1 Question 25 article 3&lt;/ref&gt; This definition of omnipotence solves some of the paradoxes associated with omnipotence, but some modern formulations of the paradox still work against this definition. Let X = "to make something that its maker cannot lift." As [[George I. Mavrodes|Mavrodes]] points out there is nothing logically contradictory about this. A man could, for example, make a boat that he could not lift.&lt;ref name="Mavrodes"&gt;Mavrodes, George. "[http://spot.colorado.edu/~kaufmad/courses/Mavrodes.pdf Some Puzzles Concerning Omnipotence]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}" first published 1963 now in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 131–34&lt;/ref&gt;   
#"Y is '''omnipotent'''" means "Y can do X" is true if and only if "Y does X" is logically consistent. Here the idea is to exclude actions that are inconsistent for Y to do but might be consistent for others. Again sometimes it looks as if Aquinas takes this position.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aquinas]] [[Summa Theologica]] Book 1 Question 25 article 4 response #3&lt;/ref&gt; Here Mavrodes' worry about X= "to make something its maker cannot lift" is no longer a problem, because "God does X" is not logically consistent. However, this account may still have problems with moral issues like X = "tells a lie" or temporal issues like X = "brings it about that Rome was never founded."&lt;ref name = "Geach" /&gt;
#"Y is '''omnipotent'''" means whenever "Y will bring about X" is logically possible, then "Y can bring about X" is true. This sense, also does not allow the paradox of omnipotence to arise, and unlike definition #3 avoids any temporal worries about whether or not an omnipotent being could change the past. However, Geach criticizes even this sense of omnipotence as misunderstanding the nature of God's promises.&lt;ref name = "Geach" /&gt;
#"Y is '''almighty'''" means that Y is not just more powerful than any creature; no creature can compete with Y in power, even unsuccessfully.&lt;ref name="Geach" /&gt; In this account nothing like the omnipotence paradox arises, but perhaps that is because God is not taken to be in any sense omnipotent. On the other hand, [[Anselm of Canterbury]] seems to think that almightiness is one of the things that make God count as omnipotent.&lt;ref name = "amselm"&gt;[[Anselm of Canterbury]] Proslogion Chap VII in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] in his [[City of God (book)|City of God]] writes "[[God]] is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills" and thus proposes the definition that "Y is '''omnipotent'''" means "If Y wishes to do X then Y can and does do X". 
 
The notion of omnipotence can also be applied to an entity in different ways. An '''essentially omnipotent''' being is an entity that is necessarily omnipotent. In contrast, an '''accidentally omnipotent''' being is an entity that can be omnipotent for a temporary period of time, and then becomes non-omnipotent. The omnipotence paradox can be applied to each type of being differently.&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;Hoffman, Joshua, Rosenkrantz, Gary. [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2002/entries/omnipotence/ "Omnipotence"] ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2002 Edition)''. Edward N. Zalta (ed.). (Accessed on 19 April 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Philosophers, such as [[René Descartes]], argue that God is absolutely omnipotent.&lt;ref name="Descartes, Rene 1641"&gt;Descartes, Rene, 1641. ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. Cottingham, J., trans., 1996. Cambridge University Press. Latin original. Alternative English title: ''Metaphysical Meditations''. Includes six ''Objections and Replies''. A second edition published the following year, includes an additional ‘’Objection and Reply’’ and a ''Letter to Dinet''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some philosophers have considered the assumption that a being is either omnipotent or non-omnipotent to be a [[false dilemma]], as it neglects the possibility of varying degrees of omnipotence.&lt;ref name=Haeckel1&gt;[[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel, Ernst]]. ''The Riddle of the Universe.'' Harper and Brothers, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern approaches to the problem have involved [[semantics|semantic]] debates over whether language—and therefore philosophy—can meaningfully address the concept of omnipotence itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein, Ludwig.]] [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]] (6.41 and following)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed answers==

===Omnipotence doesn't mean breaking the laws of logic===

A common response from Christian philosophers, such as [[Norman Geisler]] or [[William Lane Craig]], is that the paradox assumes a wrong definition of omnipotence. Omnipotence, they say, does not mean that God can do anything ''at all'' but, rather, that he can do ''anything that's possible according to his nature.'' The distinction is important. God cannot perform logical absurdities; he cannot, for instance, make 1+1=3. Likewise, God cannot make a being greater than himself because he is, by definition, the greatest possible being. God is limited in his actions to his nature. The Bible supports this, they assert, in passages such as Hebrews 6:18, which says it is "impossible for God to lie."

Another common response to the omnipotence paradox is to try to define omnipotence to mean something weaker than absolute omnipotence, such as definition 3 or 4 above. The paradox can be resolved by simply stipulating that omnipotence does not require that the being have abilities that are logically impossible, but only be able to do anything that conforms to the laws of logic. A good example of a modern defender of this line of reasoning is George Mavrodes.&lt;ref name = "Mavrodes" /&gt; Essentially, Mavrodes argues that it is no limitation on a being's omnipotence to say that it cannot make a round square. Such a "task" is termed by him a "pseudo-task" as it is self-contradictory and inherently nonsense. [[Harry Frankfurt]]—following from Descartes—has responded to this solution with a proposal of his own: that God can create a stone impossible to lift and also lift said stone&lt;blockquote&gt;For why should God not be able to perform the task in question? To be sure, it is a task—the task of lifting a stone which He cannot lift—whose description is self-contradictory. But if God is supposed capable of performing one task whose description is self-contradictory—that of creating the problematic stone in the first place—why should He not be supposed capable of performing another—that of lifting the stone? After all, is there any greater trick in performing two logically impossible tasks than there is in performing one?&lt;ref name="frankfurt"&gt;Frankfurt, Harry. "The Logic of Omnipotence" first published in 1964 in ''[[Philosophical Review]]'' and now in ''Necessity, Volition, and Love''. [[Cambridge University Press]] November 28, 1998 pp.1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If a being is ''accidentally omnipotent'', it can resolve the paradox by creating a stone it cannot lift, thereby becoming non-omnipotent. Unlike essentially omnipotent entities, it is possible for an accidentally omnipotent being to be non-omnipotent. This raises the question, however, of whether or not the being was ever truly omnipotent, or just capable of great power.&lt;ref name="Hoffman" /&gt; On the other hand, the ability to voluntarily give up great power is often thought of as central to the notion of the Christian Incarnation.&lt;ref name="gore"&gt;Gore, Charles, "A Kenotic Theory of Incarnation" first published 1891, in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 165–68&lt;/ref&gt;

If a being is ''essentially omnipotent'', then it can also resolve the paradox (as long as we take omnipotence not to require absolute omnipotence). The omnipotent being is essentially omnipotent, and therefore it is impossible for it to be non-omnipotent. Further, the omnipotent being can do what is logically impossible—just like the accidentally omnipotent—and have no limitations except the inability to become non-omnipotent. The omnipotent being cannot create a stone it cannot lift.

The omnipotent being cannot create such a stone because its power is equal to itself—thus, removing the omnipotence, for there can only be one omnipotent being, but it nevertheless retains its omnipotence. This solution works even with definition 2—as long as we also know the being is essentially omnipotent rather than accidentally so. However, it is possible for non-omnipotent beings to compromise their own powers, which presents the paradox that non-omnipotent beings can do something (to themselves) which an essentially omnipotent being cannot do (to itself). This was essentially the position [[Augustine of Hippo]] took in his ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;For He is called omnipotent on account of His doing what He wills, not on account of His suffering what He wills not; for if that should befall Him, He would by no means be omnipotent. Wherefore, He cannot do some things for the very reason that He is omnipotent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.V.10.html|title=NPNF1-02. St. Augustine's City of God and Christian Doctrine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus Augustine argued that God could not do anything or create any situation that would, in effect, make God not God.

In a 1955 article in the philosophy journal ''Mind'', [[J. L. Mackie]] tried to resolve the paradox by distinguishing between first-order omnipotence (unlimited power to act) and second-order omnipotence (unlimited power to determine what powers to act things shall have).&lt;ref&gt;[[J. L. Mackie|Mackie, J. L.]], "Evil and Omnipotence." ''Mind'' LXIV, No, 254 (April 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; An omnipotent being with both first and second-order omnipotence at a particular time might restrict its own power to act and, henceforth, cease to be omnipotent in either sense. There has been considerable philosophical dispute since Mackie, as to the best way to formulate the paradox of omnipotence in formal logic.&lt;ref name = "TPoG"&gt;The Power of God: Readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978. Keene and Mayo disagree p. 145, Savage provides 3 formalizations p. 138–41, Cowan has a different strategy p. 147, and Walton uses a whole separate strategy p. 153–63&lt;/ref&gt;

;God and logic

: &lt;p&gt;Although the most common translation of the noun "Logos" is "Word" other translations have been used. Gordon Clark (1902–1985), a Calvinist theologian and expert on pre-Socratic philosophy, famously translated Logos as "Logic": "In the beginning was the Logic, and the Logic was with God and the Logic was God." He meant to imply by this translation that the laws of logic were derived from God and formed part of Creation, and were therefore not a secular principle imposed on the Christian world view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;p&gt;God obeys the laws of logic because God is eternally logical in the same way that God does not perform evil actions because God is eternally good. So, God, by nature logical and unable to violate the laws of logic, cannot make a boulder so heavy he cannot lift it because that would violate the [[law of non contradiction]] by creating an immovable object and an unstoppable force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises the question, similar to the [[Euthyphro Dilemma]], of where this law of logic, which God is bound to obey, comes from. According to these theologians ([[Norman Geisler]] and [[William Lane Craig]]), this law is not a law above God that he assents to but, rather, logic is an eternal part of God's nature, like his [[omniscience]] or [[omnibenevolence]].&lt;/p&gt;

===Paradox is meaningless: the question is sophistry, meaning it makes grammatical sense, but has no intelligible meaning===

Another common response is that since God is supposedly omnipotent, the phrase "could not lift" does not make sense and the paradox is meaningless.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Problem of Pain, Clive Staples Lewis, 1944 MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loving Wisdom: Christian Philosophy of Religion by Paul Copan, Chalice Press, 2007 page 46&lt;/ref&gt; This may mean that the complexity involved in rightly understanding omnipotence—contra all the logical details involved in misunderstanding it—is a function of the fact that omnipotence, like infinity, is perceived at all by contrasting reference to those complex and variable things, ''which it is not''.  An alternative meaning, however, is that a non-corporeal God cannot lift anything, but can raise it (a linguistic pedantry)—or to use the beliefs of Hindus (that there is one God, who can be manifest as several different beings) that whilst it is possible for God to do all things, it is not possible for all his incarnations to do them. As such, God could create a stone so heavy that, in one incarnation, he couldn't lift it, yet could do something that an incarnation that ''could'' lift the stone could not.

The lifting a rock paradox (''Can God lift a stone larger than he can carry?'') uses human characteristics to cover up the main skeletal structure of the question. With these assumptions made, two arguments can stem from it:

#'''Lifting''' covers up the definition of '''translation''', which means moving something from one point in space to another. With this in mind, the real question would be, "''Can God move a rock from one location in space to another that is larger than possible?''" For the rock to be unable to move from one space to another, it would have to be larger than space itself. However, it is impossible for a rock to be larger than space, as space always adjusts itself to cover the space of the rock. If the supposed rock was out of space-time dimension, then the question would not make sense—because it would be impossible to move an object from one location in space to another if there is no space to begin with, meaning the faulting is with the logic of the question and not God's capabilities.
#The words, "Lift a Stone" are used instead to substitute capability. With this in mind, essentially the question is asking if God is incapable, so the real question would be, "''Is God capable of being incapable?''" If God is capable of being incapable, it means that He is incapable, because He has the potential to not be able to do something. Conversely, if God is incapable of being incapable, then the two inabilities cancel each other out, making God have the capability to do something.

The act of killing oneself is not applicable to an omnipotent being, since, despite that such an act does involve some power, it also involves a ''lack'' of power: the human person who can kill himself is already not indestructible, and, in fact, every agent constituting his environment is more powerful in some ways than himself. In other words, all non-omnipotent agents are concretely ''synthetic'': constructed as contingencies of other, smaller, agents, meaning that they, unlike an omnipotent agent, logically can exist not only in multiple instantiation (by being constructed out of the more basic agents they are made of), but are each bound to a different location in space contra transcendent [[omnipresence]].

[[Thomas Aquinas]] asserts that the paradox arises from a misunderstanding of omnipotence. He maintains that inherent contradictions and logical impossibilities do not fall under the omnipotence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/a/aquinas/summa/FP/FP025.html#FPQ25A3THEP1 |title=Summa Theologica |publisher=Ccel.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  J. L Cowan sees this paradox as a reason to reject the concept of 'absolute' omnipotence,&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, J. L. "The Paradox of Omnipotence" first published 1962, in ''The Power of God: Readings on Omnipotence and Evil''. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 144–52&lt;/ref&gt; while others, such as [[René Descartes]], argue that God is absolutely omnipotent, despite the problem.&lt;ref name="Descartes, Rene 1641"/&gt;

[[C. S. Lewis]] argues that when talking about omnipotence, referencing "a rock so heavy that God cannot lift it" is nonsense just as much as referencing "a square circle"; that it is not logically coherent in terms of power to think that omnipotence includes the power to do the logically impossible. So asking "Can God create a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?" is just as much nonsense as asking "Can God draw a square circle?" The logical contradiction here being God's simultaneous ability and disability in lifting the rock: the statement "God can lift this rock" must have a truth value of either true or false, it cannot possess both. This is justified by observing that for the omnipotent agent to create such a stone, it must already be more powerful than itself: such a stone is too heavy for the omnipotent agent to lift, but the omnipotent agent already can create such a stone; If an omnipotent agent already is more powerful than itself, then it already is just that powerful. This means that its power to create a stone that’s too heavy for it to lift is identical to its power to lift that very stone. While this doesn’t quite make complete sense, Lewis wished to stress its implicit point: that even within the attempt to prove that the concept of omnipotence is immediately incoherent, one admits that it is immediately coherent, and that the only difference is that this attempt is forced to admit this despite that the attempt is constituted by a perfectly irrational route to its own unwilling end, with a perfectly irrational set of 'things' included in that end.

In other words, the 'limit' on what omnipotence 'can' do is not a ''limit'' on its actual agency, but an ''epistemological boundary'' without which omnipotence could not be ''identified'' (paradoxically or otherwise) in the first place. In fact, this process is merely a fancier form of the classic [[Liar Paradox]]: If I say, "I am a liar", then how can it be true if I am telling the truth therewith, and, if I am telling the truth therewith, then how can I be a liar? So, to think that omnipotence is an ''epistemological'' paradox is like failing to recognize that, when taking the statement, 'I am a liar' self-referentially, the statement is reduced to an actual failure to lie. In other words, if one maintains the supposedly 'initial' position that the necessary conception of omnipotence includes the 'power' to compromise both itself and all other identity, and if one concludes from this position that omnipotence is epistemologically incoherent, then one implicitly is asserting that one's own 'initial' position is incoherent. Therefore, the question (and therefore the perceived paradox) is meaningless.  Nonsense does not suddenly acquire sense and meaning with the addition of the two words, "God can" before it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Lewis additionally said that, "Unless something is self-evident, nothing can be proved." This implies for the debate on omnipotence that, ''as in matter, so in the human understanding of truth: it takes no true insight to destroy a perfectly integrated structure, and the effort to destroy has greater effect than an equal effort to build; so, a man is thought a fool who assumes its integrity, and thought an abomination who argues for it. It is easier to teach a fish to swim in outer space than to convince a room full of ignorant fools why it cannot be done.''

==Language and omnipotence==
The philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] is frequently interpreted as arguing that language is not up to the task of describing the kind of power an omnipotent being would have. In his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', he stays generally within the realm of [[logical positivism]] until claim 6.4—but at 6.41 and following, he argues that [[ethics]] and several other issues are "transcendental" subjects that we cannot examine with language. Wittgenstein also mentions the will, life after death, and God—arguing that, "When the answer cannot be put into words, neither can the question be put into words."&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig. proposition 6.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein's work expresses the omnipotence paradox as a problem in [[semantics]]—the study of how we give symbols meaning. (The retort "That's only semantics," is a way of saying that a statement only concerns the definitions of words, instead of anything important in the physical world.) According to the ''Tractatus,'' then, even attempting to formulate the omnipotence paradox is futile, since language cannot refer to the entities the paradox considers. The final proposition of the ''Tractatus'' gives Wittgenstein's dictum for these circumstances: "What we cannot speak of, we must pass over in silence".&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein, Ludwig. proposition 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Wittgenstein's approach to these problems is influential among other 20th century religious thinkers such as [[D. Z. Phillips]].&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;[[D. Z. Phillips]] "Philosophy, Theology and the Reality of God" in Philosophy of Religion: Selected Readings. William Rowe and William Wainwright eds. 3rd ed. 1998 Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, however, Wittgenstein wrote works often interpreted as conflicting with his positions in the ''Tractatus'',&lt;ref name="hacker"&gt;Hacker, P.M.S. Wittgenstein's Place in Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy. 1996 Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed the later Wittgenstein is mainly seen as the leading critic of the early Wittgenstein.

==Other versions of the paradox==
In the 6th century, [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] claims that a version of the omnipotence paradox constituted the dispute between Paul the Apostle and Elymas the Magician mentioned in [[Acts 13]]:8, but it is phrased in terms of a debate as to whether or not God can "deny himself" ala 2 Tim 2:13.&lt;ref name = "psd"&gt;[[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]], "Divine Names" 893B in Pseudo-Dionysius: The Complete Works. trans Colm Luibheid Paulist Press. 1987. {{ISBN|0-8091-2838-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th century, [[Anselm of Canterbury]] argues that there are many things that God cannot do, but that nonetheless he counts as omnipotent.&lt;ref name="anselm"&gt;Anselm of Canterbury Proslogion Chap. VII, in The Power of God: readings on Omnipotence and Evil. Linwood Urban and Douglass Walton eds. Oxford University Press 1978 pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Aquinas]] advanced a version of the omnipotence paradox by asking whether God could create a triangle with internal angles that did not add up to 180 degrees. As Aquinas put it in [[Summa contra Gentiles]]:

{{quotation|Since the principles of certain sciences, such as logic, geometry and arithmetic are taken only from the formal principles of things, on which the essence of the thing depends, it follows that God could not make things contrary to these principles. For example, that a genus was not predicable of the species, or that lines drawn from the centre to the circumference were not equal, or that a triangle did not have three angles equal to two right angles.&lt;ref&gt;"Cum principia quarundam scientiarum, ut logicae, geometriae et arithmeticae, sumantur ex solis principiis formalibus rerum, ex quibus essentia rei dependet, sequitur quod contraria horum principiorum Deus facere non possit: sicut quod genus non sit praedicabile de specie; vel quod lineae ductae a centro ad circumferentiam non sint aequales; aut quod triangulus rectilineus non habeat tres angulos aequales duobus rectis". Aquinas, T. ''Summa Contra Gentiles'', Book 2, Section 25. trans. Edward Buckner&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This can be done on a sphere, and not on a flat surface. The later invention of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] does not resolve this question; for one might as well ask, "If given the axioms of [[elliptic geometry|Riemannian geometry]], can an omnipotent being create a triangle whose angles ''do not'' add up to ''more'' than 180 degrees?" In either case, the real question is whether or not an omnipotent being would have the ability to evade consequences that follow logically from a system of axioms that the being created.

A version of the paradox can also be seen in non-theological contexts. A similar problem occurs when accessing legislative or [[parliamentary sovereignty]], which holds a specific legal institution to be omnipotent in legal power, and in particular such an institution's ability to regulate itself.&lt;ref&gt;Suber, P. (1990) [http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psa/sec01.htm#C ''The Paradox of Self-Amendment: A Study of Law, Logic, Omnipotence, and Change'']. Peter Lang Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sense, the classic statement of the omnipotence paradox — a rock so heavy that its omnipotent creator cannot lift it — is grounded in [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] science. After all, if we consider the stone's position relative to the sun the planet orbits around, one could hold that the stone is ''constantly'' lifted—strained though that interpretation would be in the present context. Modern physics indicates that the choice of phrasing about lifting stones should relate to acceleration; however, this does not in itself of course invalidate the fundamental concept of the generalized omnipotence paradox. However, one could easily modify the classic statement as follows: "An omnipotent being creates a [[universe]] that follows the laws of Aristotelian physics. Within this universe, can the omnipotent being create a stone so heavy that the being cannot lift it?"

[[Ethan Allen]]'s ''Reason'' addresses the topics of [[original sin]], [[theodicy]] and several others in classic [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] fashion.&lt;ref name = "allen"&gt;[[Ethan Allen|Allen, Ethan]]. [http://libertyonline.hypermall.com/allen-reason.html ''Reason: The Only Oracle of Man.''] J.P. Mendum, Cornill; 1854. Originally published 1784. (Accessed on 19 April 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In Chapter 3, section IV, he notes that "omnipotence itself" could not exempt animal life from mortality, since change and death are defining attributes of such life. He argues, "the one cannot be without the other, any more than there could be a compact number of mountains without valleys, or that I could exist and not exist at the same time, or that God should effect any other contradiction in nature." Labeled by his friends a [[Deism|Deist]], Allen accepted the notion of a divine being, though throughout ''Reason'' he argues that even a divine being must be circumscribed by logic.

In ''[[Principles of Philosophy]],'' [[Descartes]] tried refuting the existence of atoms with a variation of this argument, claiming God could not create things so indivisible that he could not divide them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2148">A '''pan-region''' is a [[geographic region]] or state’s sphere of economic, political and cultural influence extending beyond that state's borders. For example, the pan-region of the [[United States of America]] (USA) regions both bordering the USA and its close neighbors including, [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and many [[South American|South America]] other states.

==Origin of term==
The idea of pan-regions or spheres of economic and cultural influence was first developed by [[Karl Ernst Haushofer]] (8/27/1869-3/10/1946), a German General, [[Geography|geographer]] and [[Geopolitics|geo-politician]]. Pan-regions contributed to Geopolitik or the German theories of [[foreign policy]] during the interwar period (1918–1939) or the time from the end of [[World War I]] and the beginning of [[World War II]]. Haushofer’s pan-regions divided the world under three supreme leading states in [[economy]], [[politics]] and [[culture]]. Those three states included the USA who controlled [[North America]] and much of South America, [[Germany]] who controlled [[Europe]], much of [[Africa]] and [[western Asia]] and [[Japan]] who controlled central, eastern, and the islands of southern Asia. These leading states could expect their regions to develop economic and [[political alliance]] with their leading state as well as yield to [[International sanctions|sanctions]] and major cultural designations.

==Historical examples==
Historically, the world was divided into three spheres of control, however after the end of World War II, Germany and Japan’s control over their various regions have diminished with the success of other nations. For example, German control over Europe has suffered with the development of the [[Europe]]an Union and emergence of other foreign powers. Japan also is beginning to lose economic dominance over its pan-region with the emergence of a thriving [[Chinese economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Peter, and Colin Flint.

'''Peter William Geoffrey Newman AO''' (born 1945) is an environmental scientist, author and educator based in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]]. He is currently Professor of Sustainability at [[Curtin University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.curtin.edu.au/about/staff/index.cfm/p.newman Curtin University: Staff Profiles], retrieved 19 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded an Order of Australia for [[sustainable transport]] and urban design in 2014. 
He has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in Chemistry (1972, University of Western Australia) and completed post doctoral studies in [[Environmental Science]], [[Delft University of Technology|Delft University]], Dip EST, Environmental Science, 1972.

Newman has written 20 books and over 330 papers on sustainable cities and is most known for creating the term ‘[[Automobile dependency|automobile dependence]]’ in the second half of the 1980s. He was closely associated with the redevelopment of Perth's rail system from 1979 to the present, which is now seen as a model for how car dependent cities can change towards more sustainable transport. He is a Lead Author for Transport on the IPCC - [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].

==Career and influence==
Newman is best known internationally for popularizing the term ‘[[Automobile dependency|automobile dependence]]’ in the second half of the 1980s to explain how the cities of the time based on sprawling suburbs were inevitably leading to the growth in automobile use.  He led an international research project with colleague Jeff Kenworthy on transport practices and structures (original data collected on 33 global cities). The results were published in ''Cities and Automobile Dependence: An International Sourcebook'',  which introduced the concept of [[Automobile dependency|car dependence]] -  now a feature of planning literature and policy.  The two researchers later collaborated on the book ''Sustainability and Cities: Overcoming Automobile Dependence'' which was launched in the [[White House]] in 1999, as the President’s [[Commission on Sustainable Development|Council on Sustainable Development]] was moving toward a more urban focus, and more recently The End of Automobile Dependence: How Cities are Moving Beyond Car-based Planning.

In ''Cities as Sustainable Ecosystems: Principles and Practices'' written with Isabella Jennings, Newman shows how city residents can begin to reintegrate into their bioregional environment, and how cities themselves can be planned with [[ecological sustainability]] in mind. Drawing on examples from many parts of the world, the authors show how urban redevelopment in some cities has involved harvesting rainwater, greening roofs, and producing [[renewable energy]]. Other cities have biodiversity parks for endangered species, community gardens that support a connection to their foodshed, and pedestrian-friendly spaces that encourage walking and cycling.&lt;ref name=sust&gt;[http://www.sustainability.murdoch.edu.au/  Cities as Sustainable Ecosystems: Principles and Practices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021023827/http://www.sustainability.murdoch.edu.au/ |date=21 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local, State and Federal Government===
Between 1976-80 Newman has served as a local government councillor in the [[City of Fremantle]].&lt;ref name="Curtin"&gt;[http://humanities.curtin.edu.au/about/staff/index.cfm/p.newman Curtin University: ''Staff Profiles''], retrieved 6 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Newman has been a government advisor through three secondments to the Western Australian State Government. In the last secondment (2001–03), he was the Director of Sustainability Policy in the Department of Premier and Cabinet where he managed and wrote the State Sustainability Strategy: the first in the world at the state/province level.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} In 2004-2005 he was the New South Wales Sustainability Commissioner.

Between 2008 and 2014 he was a member of [[Infrastructure Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minister.infrastructure.gov.au/aa/releases/2008/May/AA043_2008.htm The Hon Anthony Albanese MP: Media Release 19 May 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303100203/http://www.minister.infrastructure.gov.au/aa/releases/2008/May/AA043_2008.htm |date=3 March 2011 }}, retrieved 19 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===
From 1989 to 2007 Newman was Director of the Institute for Sustainability and Technology Policy, [[Murdoch University]] in [[Murdoch, Western Australia]]. In 2007, Newman left Murdoch University to join Curtin University.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://campusnews.curtin.edu.au/media_centre/archives.cfm?release=2823 Sustainability experts join Curtin]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006-07 he was a [[Fulbright Scholar]] at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville.

===International advisor===
Peter Newman is member of the Global Research Network on Human Settlements Advisory Board and the Scientific Advisory Committee of the [[UNESCO]] ''SCOPE Ecopolis Project''. He is Senior Consultant at [[Jan Gehl|Gehl Architects]], Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gehlarchitects.com/?#/160161/ Gehl Architects: ''Team Members''], retrieved 6 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''political economy of communications''', news, or media, is a particular branch in [[Communication studies]] or [[media studies]] which studies the power relations ([[political economy]]) that constitute the communication of information from the [[mass media]] to its publics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Media|last=Flew|first=Terry|last2=Smith|first2=Richard|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-900550-5|location=Don Mills, ON|pages=1–26, 57–75, 275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been developed by media and political economy scholars, such as [[Dallas Walker Smythe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Melody, B.|year=1994|title=Dallas Smythe: Pioneer in the political economy of communications|editor=T.

== Influences ==

One of the most early modern works in the political economy of communications are [[Harold Innis]]' works which were compiled in the book ''[[Empire and Communications]]''. This directly inspired [[Marshall McLuhan]], a colleague of Innis at the University of Toronto, who would later be made famous for the dictum "the medium is the message". Subsequent PEC approaches have been heavily influenced by Marxist thought and democratic politics, as it questions powers of and within communications against the realization of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardy|first=Jonathan|date=2014-06-01|title=Critical political economy of communications: A mid-term review|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/mcp/2014/00000010/00000002/art00008|journal=International Journal of Media &amp; Cultural Politics|volume=10|issue=2|pages=189–202|doi=10.1386/macp.10.2.189_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marxian economics|Marxist]] Thought- The [[Ethics|moral philosophy]] of PEC dictates it to often criticize [[capitalism]] for its effect on media and democracy, which originates from the [[Critical theory (Frankfurt School|critical theory]] works of [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fuchs|first=Christan|date=2014|title=WikiLeaks and the Critique of the Political Economy|url=|journal=International Journal of Communication|volume=8|issue=1932–8036/2014FEA0002|pages=2718–2732}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common critique of critical political economy (often from the [[cultural studies]] approach) is that, like [[Marxism|Marx]], it [[Fetishism|fetishizes]] [[capitalism]] and is deterministic [[Technological determinism|technologically]] and/or [[Economic determinism|economically]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* [[Democracy|Democratic Politics]]- PEC views media and information as the ultimate democratizer of power, and thus includes social [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] as a criterion. Ultimately, this means that PEC encourages [[media reform]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and government intervention in the [[Market (economics)|marketplace.]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Main Topics of Study ==

[[File:News Corp logo 2013.svg|thumb|Logo of [[News Corp]], a mass media conglomerate and a subject of concentrated ownership. ]]
* [[Concentration of media ownership|Media ownership]]- Concentration of ownership in media industries as a result of [[Technological convergence|convergence]] and [[Conglomeration|media conglomeration]] under [[neoliberal economics]] have become a concern for media [[Diversity (business)|diversity]] and [[Democracy|democratic discourse]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Support mechanisms- [[Advertising]], [[marketing]], [[Subscription business model|subscription]], [[social media]], and [[crowdfunding]] [[revenue]]s are examples of economic support for media organizations. Such mechanisms influence what types of [[Content (media)|content]] are published or not published, the nature of the [[commodity]] (content vs. [[the audience]] vs. [[advertisers]]) and are thus relevant to PEC studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* [[Government policy]]- Policy [[Media regulation|regulates]] media and its economics in terms of ownership, affecting how [[Creative industries|media industries]] operate as well as the role of media in society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Journalism/News Media ==

As [[Journalism|journalism/news media]] is the core to the functioning of democratic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.5406/j.ctt1xcjws|title=Normative Theories of the Media: Journalism in Democratic Societies|last=Christians|first=Clifford G.|last2=Glasser|first2=Theodore L.|last3=McQuail|first3=Denis|last4=Nordenstreng|first4=Kaarle|last5=White|first5=Robert A.|date=2009-01-01|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252034237|doi=10.5406/j.ctt1xcjws|doi-broken-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEC works towards the goal of "healthy journalism."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|date=2012-10-01|title=Farewell to Journalism?|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=6|issue=5–6|pages=614–626|doi=10.1080/17512786.2012.683273|issn=1751-2786}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for democracy, the current state of news media around the world and especially that of [[Media of the United States|the United States]], falls short of the general consensus (among media scholars and democratic theory) on what is considered to be healthy [[journalism]]. This is due in part to the overwhelming amount of [[public relations]] material being posed as [[News media|news]].&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

It is in the interest of PEC that journalism instead provide a "rigorous account" of those in power, meet the information needs of all classes and people, be truthful, and act as an early warning system by providing a "wide range of informed opinions on the most important issues of our time."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== New Media ==

[[Mass media|The mass media]] are undoubtedly experiencing considerable changes in platform, technology, and economic structure (e.g., [[crowdfunding]], [[social media]]) as the [[digital era]] continues to shift people toward "[[New media|new" media]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Traditional financial configurations and business models have been destabilized by this transformation. However, new mechanisms of power have emerged from this more open system of information and news creation. The availability of information can now be skewed or influenced through "search, aggregation, and digital distribution infrastructures" (p.&amp;nbsp;493).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Picard|first=Robert G.|date=2014-09-03|title=Twilight or New Dawn of Journalism?|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=15|issue=5|pages=500–510|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2014.895530|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent Mosco's definition of political economic studies, where the "production, distribution, and consumption of resources, including communication resources” are essential, thus remains relevant even in times of [[new media]], since a new [[Network economy|(network) economy/society]] forms its ''own'' power relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The rise of the network society|last=Manuel.|first=Castells|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=9780631221401|oclc=254487176}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International encyclopedia of communication online|last=1949-|first=Donsbach, Wolfgang|last2=Association.|first2=International Communication|last3=(Firm)|first3=Wiley-Blackwell|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Wiley/Blackwell|isbn=9781405131995|oclc=271856987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://users.ipfw.edu/tankel/Syllabi/Spring%202010/COM%20330/BBarrettPoliticaleconomy.pdf|title=Approaches to Media|last=Boyd-Barrett|first=Oliver|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=186–192|chapter=The political economy approach}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30355">‘Net positive’, from '''Positive Development''' (PD) theory, is a new paradigm in [[sustainable development]] and design.  PD theory (taught and published from 2003)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2003) ‘Retrofitting: Beyond Zero Waste’, in ''KLM-UC International Conference Proceedings'', University of Canberra, ACT, Australia; Birkeland, J. (2004) ‘Building Assessment Systems: Reversing Environmental Impacts’, Nature and Society Forum, ACT, Australia, http://www.naf.org.au/naf-forum/birkeland (accessed 2005);  Birkeland, J. (2005) ‘Reversing Negative Impacts by Design’, in ''Sustainability for the ACT: the Future’s in our Hands'', Office of Sustainability, ACT, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; was first detailed in ''Positive Development'' (2008).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development: From Vicious Circles to Virtuous Cycles through Built Environment Design’'', Earthscan, London.  (A two volume book updating net positive theory is forthcoming.)&lt;/ref&gt; A net positive system/structure would ‘give back to nature and society more than it takes’ over its life cycle.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Eco-positive impacts of development must keep pace with human consumption (or ecological footprint) and offset past losses of nature, as defined in ''Positive Development'' ''(Ibid)'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ‘sustainable development’ - in the real-world context of population growth, biodiversity losses, cumulative pollution, wealth disparities and social inequities - closes off future options.  To reverse direction, development must, among other sustainability criteria, increase nature beyond pre-human conditions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;A sustainable building should aim to be better for nature/society than no building at all, as well as increase nature beyond native conditions.  A rule of reason would be applied as to whether the baseline is pre-industrial or pre-historic, depending on the location and circumstances.&lt;/ref&gt; PD develops the tools to enable net positive design and development.

== Net Positive Sustainability ==
According to PD, the original precepts of sustainability (nature preservation and equity among current/future generations)&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;These principles are common to most early definitions of sustainability and were endorsed at a national level as early as 1969 in the preamble to the National Environmental Protection Act in the United States. Among the first international documents to define sustainability was the IUCN/UNEP/WWF (1980) ''World Conservation Strategy'', re-published in 1991 as ''Caring for the Earth: A Strategy for Sustainable Living'', The World Conservation Union, United Nations Environment Program and World Wide Fund for Nature, Earthscan, London, UK.  Here it meant improving life quality within the earth’s ecological carrying capacity. See also COAG (1992) The National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development (NSESD), Council of Australian Governments, Canberra, Australia.  For historical context, see Commoner, B. (1971) ''The Closing Circle: Nature, Man And Technology'', Knopf, New York and Porritt, J. (1985) ''Seeing Green: The Politics of Ecology Explained'', Blackwell Publishers, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; require increasing future options.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Social options do not mean more consumer products but rather substantive and positive life choices which requires increasing the ecological base and public estate.&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, requires that development increase the life support system (nature).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;The idea that sustainability requires maintaining or increasing future option was discussed in Birkeland, J. (1993) ''Planning for a Sustainable Society: Institutional Reform and Social Transformation'', University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania. See also Norton, B.G. (2005) ''Sustainability: A Philosophy of Adaptive Ecosystem Management'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois for a comprehensive discussion on this point.&lt;/ref&gt; Green design always aimed for ecological restoration, social regeneration and economic revitalization.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;For a typology of green building design, see Birkeland, J. (2013) ‘Business Opportunities through Positive Development’, in ''A New Dynamic: Effective Business in a Circular Economy'', in K. Webster, J. Bleriot, and C. Johnston (Eds), Ellen MacArthur Foundation Publishing, Isle of Wight, UK, pp. 87-110.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these essentially ‘add value’ relative to ''current'' sites, buildings or practices.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;For a discussion of contemporary sustainable building design approaches, see Hes, D. and du Plessus, D. (2015) ''Designing for Hope: Pathways to Regenerative Sustainability'', Taylor &amp; Francis, New York. USA.&lt;/ref&gt; They do not increase nature in absolute terms.  Positive development is defined as structures that increase universal life quality and future options by expanding the ‘ecological base’ (ecosystems, ecological carrying capacity, biodiversity) and the ‘public estate’ (universal access to means of survival/wellbeing and social capital).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Birkeland, J.

== Terminology Clarification ==
The term net positive&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;The term also appears as ‘net-positive’ or ‘netpositive’.  A special issue was dedicated to net-positive design.  See Cole, R. (2015) ‘Net-zero and Net-positive Design: a question of value’, in ''Building Research &amp; Information'' 43(1), pp. 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; is increasingly used by green designers, developers and businesses.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;For example, see Forum for the Future, WWF, and The Climate Group (2015) ''Net Positive: A New Way of Doing Business''. Available at http://www.theclimategroup.org/what-we-do/publications/net-positive-a-new-way-of-doing-business/ Accessed June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in context, it usually means just ‘giving back’ - that is, without fixed baselines&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Benchmarks are relative to the present, so eco-restoration is seen by some as net positive, yet this does not account for past biodiversity losses and increased human consumption.&lt;/ref&gt; - by optimizing material resources, energy and stakeholder benefits, etc.  This was the aim of 20th Century green building design.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;There are a wide range of 20th Century green design books, including:  Papanek, V. (1971) ''Design for the Real World: human ecology and social change'', Pantheon Books, New York; Johnson, R. (1979) ''The Green City'', MacMillan: S. Melbourne, Australia;  Todd, N. and J. Todd (1994) ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines'', N. Atlantic Books, Berkeley, CA.; Vale, B. and R. Vale (1975) ''The Autonomous House: Design and Planning for self-''sufficiency, Thames and Hudson Ltd, London;  Wann, D. (1996) ''Deep Design: Pathways to a Liveable Future'', Island Press, Washington, DC.;  Lyle, J.T. (1994) ''Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development'', Wiley &amp; Sons, New York;  van der Ryn, S, and Cowan, D. (1996)  ''Ecological Design'', Island Press, Washington, DC.  Mackenzie, D. (1991), ''Green Design: Design for the Environment'', Lawrence King, London;  Girardet, H. (1992), ''The Gaia Atlas of Cities: New Directions for Sustainable Urban Living'', Gaia books Ltd, London; and Yeang, K. (1999) ''The Green Skyscraper: The Basis for Designing Sustainable Intensive Buildings'', Prestel Verlag, Munich, Germany [Yeang has written numerous books on green design].&lt;/ref&gt; Although environmental ethics and social justice remain central concerns in PD,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Social factors have always been a part of sustainable design paradigms, but the focus is generally on the (psychological, social, physiological, experiential, etc.) needs of building users, and less on using a building project to solve social inequities in the wider community.&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, ‘eco-positive’ is increasingly used to underscore the ecological dimension. The term ‘net’ also causes some confusion.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;See for example, Baggs, D. (2015) Buildings Alone will Never be Regenerative, in ''Sourceable - Industry News and Analysis'' https://sourceable.net/buildings-alone-will-never-be-regenerative/ June 29.  Accessed July 2015.  This claims net positive design only concerns resource balances and does not use a life cycle perspective, but this has no basis in PD literature.&lt;/ref&gt; In PD, ‘net’ means public benefits ''beyond'' neutral impacts - not just reducing the total negative impacts to zero by, for example, making tradeoffs.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;For an overview of zero energy building, see Kibert, C.J. and Fard, M.M. (2012) Differentiating among Low-energy, Low-carbon and Net Zero-energy Building Strategies for Policy Formulation, ''Building Research &amp; Information'', 40(5), pp. 625-637.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory Origins ==
PD theory built on eco-philosophies that emerged in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;See for example, Merchant, C. (1980) ''The Death of Nature: Women, ecology, and the scientific revolution'', HarperCollins, New York; Warren, K. (1997), ''Ecofeminism: Women, Culture, Nature'', Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Indiana;  Naess, A. (1989) ''Ecology, community, and lifestyle'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, UK; Warren, K. and Wells-Howe, B. (1994) ''Ecological Feminism'', Routledge, New York;  Salleh, A. (1997) ''Ecofeminism as Politics: Nature, Marx and the Postmodern'', Zed Books, London;  Shiva, V. (1988) ''Staying Alive: Women, Ecology and Development'', Zed Books, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Calling for social transformation, they deconstructed the hierarchical cultures, dualistic thought patterns and linear-reductionist analyses of modernity. PD added a positive/negative overlay to explain why these theories did not contemplate increasing nature to offset consumption. Later, sustainability was absorbed into the dominant paradigm (DP) which assumed that current institutions could resolve the problems they fostered.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;See WCED (1987) ''Our Common Future'', Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK.  This seminal report couched sustainability within the dominant economic and policy making frameworks and did not engage with the sustainability literature critical of the dominant paradigm.&lt;/ref&gt; According to PD, existing institutional and physical structures reduce future options and are thus terminal.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;''Planning for Sustainability, Ibid.'' Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development, Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis was that, by converting negative systems into positive ones, genuinely sustainable planning, decision and design frameworks would materialize.

=== Design-decision Distinction ===
The distinction between decision-making and design is central to PD.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;See Birkeland, J. (2012) ‘Design blindness in Sustainable Development: From Closed to Open Systems Design Thinking’, in ''The Journal of Urban Design'', 17(2), pp. 163-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Decision-making processes/tools divide, compare and choose.  They use bounded or ‘closed system’ thinking which excludes considerations that are difficult to quantify.  Essentially, decision methods simplify issues and options to facilitate finding the best path from the present position or desired future.  Back-casting and scenario planning, while powerful tools, presume the future can be predicted and selected.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 165-179&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods decide now how future citizens must live.  They also reduce future options by narrowing resources, adaptability, space and biodiversity over time. Sustainability therefore requires rethinking decision-making and design tools from first principles.

=== Decision-making (reducing costs) ===
The reduction of the ecological base and public estate continues, PD argues, because new sustainability goals were spliced onto the old (anti-ecological) closed system models, methods and metrics of the DP.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; Given escalating human consumption, even global depopulation and ecological regeneration would not counterbalance total negative resource flows and ecological impacts. PD maintains that closed system models created and institutionalized zero-sum decision and measurement frameworks such as cost-benefit/risk-benefit analyses.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 117-130.&lt;/ref&gt; It identifies and ‘reverses’ over a hundred systemic biases in governance, planning, decision and design frameworks by converting them into open system and design-based frameworks to facilitate eco-positive planning and design.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;Birkeland, J. (2014) ‘Positive Development and Assessment’, in ''Smart and Sustainable Built Environments'', 3(1), pp. 4-22;  Birkeland, J. (2015) ‘Planning for Positive Development’, in J. Byrne, J. Dodson and N. Sipe (Eds), ''Australian Environmental Planning: Challenges and Future Prospects'', Routledge, pp. 246-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design (multiplying benefits) ===
Whereas the internal logic of decision frameworks (choosing) tend to diminish ecosystems and land eco-productivity, eco-logical design (creating) can multiply functions and public benefits synergistically. Eco-positive design involves open systems thinking (i.e. with transparent/permeable boundaries).  For example, building rating tools are based on limits or thresholds (borders) and do not contemplate net public gains.  Perhaps because of the deeply-embedded historic elevation of rationalist decision-making over design, green building design templates and rating tools are decision-based.  Being reductionist, they encourage tradeoffs between costs and benefits or nature and society in physical development.  Hence they tend to reduce adaptability, diversity and reversibility.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;There are many critiques of green building rating tools.  Brandon, P.S., and Lombardi, P.L. (2011) ''Evaluating Sustainable Development in the Built Environment'' (2nd ed.) Chichester, West Sussex, Ames, Iowa, Wiley-Blackwell; Gu, Z., Wennersten, R., and Assefa, G. (2006) ‘Analysis of the Most Widely Used Building Environmental Assessment Methods’, ''Environmental Sciences,'' 3(3), pp. 175-192;  Birkeland, J. (2004) ‘Building Assessment Systems: Reversing Environmental Impacts’, Nature and Society Forum, ACT, [[Australia http://www.naf.org.au/naf-forum/birkeland|Australia &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.naf.org.au/naf-forum/birkeland&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] (accessed 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
Decision systems in governance (i.e. legislative, executive and judicial) resolve conflict by allocating rights and resources - not by increasing the ecological base and/or public estate.  Hence PD suggests different frameworks for environmental governance.&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;Birkeland, J. (1996) ‘The Case for a New Public Forum’, in Furnass, B., Whyte, J., Harris, J., and Baker, A. (Eds), ''Survival, Health and Wellbeing into the 21st Century'', Nature and Society Forum, pp. 111-114.  Birkeland, J. (1995) ‘Ethics-Based Planning’, ''Australian Planner'' 33(1), pp. 47-49.&lt;/ref&gt; These include a modified constitution with a new decision sphere to deal with the unique ethical dimensions of biophysical development, planning and design.&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;Birkeland, J. (1993) ‘Towards a New System of Environmental Governance’, in ''The Environmentalist'', 13(1), pp. 19-32;  Birkeland, J. (1993) ''Planning for a Sustainable Society, Ibid''; Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 220-233.&lt;/ref&gt; Given real-world political barriers to change, PD also suggests default strategies to enable incremental reform by changing institutions from within.  PD contends that gaps can be avoided in new governance and planning systems by simply reversing each ecologically terminal convention into eco-positive ones.

== Planning ==
SMARTmode (systems mapping and redesign thinking) is a PD planning process&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;''Positive Development, Ibid,'' pp. 251-173.&lt;/ref&gt; that includes two dozen environment gap analyses to highlight sustainability issues that are almost never assessed in planning or design.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2015) ‘Planning for Positive Development’, in J. Byrne, J. Dodson and N. Sipe (Eds), ''Australian Environmental Planning: Challenges and Future Prospects'', Routledge, pp. 246-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these are forensic ‘flows analyses’ that identify (local/regional) social and ecological deficits that developments could ameliorate by design.  They can be undertaken scientifically using emerging multi-dimensional digital mapping tools,&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D. and Simpson, R., eds. (2012) ''D_City: Digital Earth, Virtual Nations, Data Cities'', D_City, Sydney, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; more pragmatically by design teams,&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (1996) ‘Improving the Design Review Process’, ''CIB Commission Conference Proceedings'', RMIT, Melbourne, pp. 150-155;  Birkeland, J. (2014) ‘Systems and Social Change for Sustainable and Resilient Cities’, L. Pearson, P. Newton and P. Roberts (Eds), ''Resilient Sustainable Cities'', Routledge, UK, pp. 66-82.&lt;/ref&gt; or more subjectively in community ‘charrettes’ (aka working bees) for workshopping planning criteria and design briefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkissian, W. (2002) ‘Pros and cons of design charrettes’, in J. Birkeland (Ed) ''Design for Sustainability: A Sourcebook of Integrated Eco-logical Solutions'', Earthscan, London, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Until planners perform these analyses routinely, therefore, they can serve as design thinking exercises, guidelines and/or criteria.

== Design ==
While improved systems of governance, decision-making and planning can assist, biophysical sustainability is ultimately a design problem. To compensate for past system design errors, fundamental reforms of design methods and processes are required.  PD proposes means to reduce material flows without tradeoffs by, for example, creating mutual gains and ‘low-impact luxury’ environments.&lt;ref&gt;Aesthetics or design quality does not equal high production costs, whereas high-tech equipment usually has high [[embodied energy]].&lt;/ref&gt; PD contends that eco-positive design is already possible, partly through the integration of natural systems with building structures, spaces and surfaces (e.g. ‘[[living machines]]’,&lt;ref&gt;Todd, N.J. and Todd J. (1994) ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines'', Atlantic Books, Berkeley, California;  J. Todd (2002) ‘Living Technologies’, in Birkeland J. (Ed) ''Design for Sustainability: A sourcebook of Integrated Eco-logical Solutions'', Earthscan, London, pp. 114-117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[mycology]],&lt;ref&gt;Stamets, P. (2005) ''Mycelium Running: How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World'', Ten Speed Press, Berkeley, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘algaetecture’&lt;ref&gt;Algae Industry Magazine (2011), Algaeindustry.com. Accessed August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;). PD contributes other design concepts (e.g. ‘design for eco-services’,&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2009) ‘Design for Eco-services’, Part A - Environmental Services, ''Environment Design Guide 77'', and Part B - Building Services, ''Environmental Design Guide 78'', Canberra, Architects Institute of Australia, Canberra, Architects Institute of Australia, pp. 1-13 and pp. 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘green scaffolding’&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2014) ‘Resilient and Sustainable Buildings’, Pearson, L., Newton P., and Roberts P. (Eds), ''Resilient Sustainable Cities'', Routledge, UK, pp. 146-159.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘green space walls’,&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2008) ‘Space Frame Walls: Facilitating Positive Development’, in ''Proceedings of the 2008 World Sustainable Building Conference''. Melbourne, Australia, September 22–25.  See also www.sustainability.org.au.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘solar core’ and ‘piggyback roof,&lt;ref&gt;Paten C., Birkeland, J. and Pears A. (2005) ‘Greening the Built Environment’, in Hargroves, C. and Smith, M.H. (Eds) ''The Natural Advantage of Nations'', London, Earthscan, pp. 367-8&lt;/ref&gt; ‘playgardens’&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2002) Playgardens and Community in ''Design for Sustainability; a Sourcebook of Eco-logical Solutions,'' Earthscan, London, pp. 109-112;  Birkeland, J. (1994) ‘Ecofeminist Playgardens’, International Play Journal, Vol. 2, pp. 49-59.&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Design for Eco-services ===
The term ‘ecosystem services’ generally applies only to human benefits, which are usually valued by units (e.g. money, carbon or energy.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. et al. (1997) ‘The Value of the World’sEcosystem Services and Natural Capital’, ''Nature'', vol 387, pp. 253–260;  Heal, G. (2000) ''Nature and the Marketplace: Capturing the Value of Ecosystem Services'', Island Press, Washington, DC; Folke, C. Jansson, Å., Larsson, J. and Costanza, R. (1997) ‘Ecosystem Appropriation by Cities, Ambio Vol 26, pp. 167-172;  Daily, G. and K. Ellison (2002) ''The New Economy of Nature'', Island Press, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; PD uses the term ‘eco-services’ to include not only nature’s instrumental (pragmatic) values like ecosystem goods and services, but its intrinsic (priceless) and ‘biophilic’ values.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.O. (1993) ''The Biophilia Hypothesis'', in S. Kellert (Ed) Island Press, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; PD considers the value of nature to be ‘infinite’ as it is not only the basis of the economy, but essential to human existence itself.  To counteract the ecological footprint of existing development,&lt;ref&gt;Wackernagel, M. and Rees W. E. (1996) ''Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing the Human Impact on the Earth'', New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt; ‘surplus’ natural and social capital&lt;ref&gt;Surplus in PD means ‘giving back more than it takes’ from a life cycle and whole system perspective, not sending energy or water back to the grid or mains.&lt;/ref&gt; - assessed from fixed biophysical baselines - must be created both off-site and on-site by design.

=== Carbon-neutral Design ===
Net positive energy is barred by the laws of physics.  Moreover, calculations of ‘net energy’ seldom include the embodied energy - let alone ecological impacts incurred during resource extraction, production and transportation.  With substantial passive solar design and renewable energy, buildings can send unused energy back to the grid, but it might be used for unsustainable purposes elsewhere. Nonetheless, a building could sequester more carbon than it emits over its life cycle with substantial building-integrated vegetation, using PD design principles.  A case study (conducted by a cross-disciplinary team) showed this would within under twelve years, well under its life span.&lt;ref&gt;Renger, C., Birkeland, J. and Midmore, D. (2015) ‘Net Positive Building Carbon Sequestration: A Case Study in Brisbane’, in ''Building Research and Information: Special issue'' on net positive design 43(1), pp. 11-24. See also Birkeland, J.L. (2008) ‘Space Frame Walls: Facilitating Positive Development’, in ''Proceedings of the 2008 World Sustainable Building Conference''. Melbourne, Australia, September 22–25, http://trove.nla.gov.au/ accessed June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design Reporting ===
The PD eco-positive design reporting process (EDR)&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (1996) ‘Improving the Design Review Process’, ''CIB Commission Conference Proceedings'', RMIT, Melbourne, pp. 150-155;  Birkeland, J. (2014) ‘Systems and Social Change for Sustainable and resilient Cities’, L. Pearson, P. Newton and P. Roberts (Eds), ''Resilient Sustainable Cities'', Routledge, UK, pp. 66-82.&lt;/ref&gt; aims to avoid many shortcomings of decision-based approaches to design.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 83-96. Rating tools often give credits for things that have financial gains like energy and water savings or worker health and productivity but do not increase the ecology, let alone offset biodiversity impacts. They do not credit actual net positive impacts.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to green building rating tools, the EDR aims to uncover opportunities to create net public gains.  Design teams answer questions based on PD design criteria&lt;ref&gt;''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 257-258.&lt;/ref&gt; and SMARTmode analyses.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2015) ‘Planning for Positive Development’, in J. Byrne, J. Dodson and N. Sipe (Eds), ''Australian Environmental Planning: Challenges and Future Prospects'', Routledge, pp. 246-257;  ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 251-273.&lt;/ref&gt; This forces education, collaboration and ‘frontloading’ design (i.e. investing more in preliminary design stages).&lt;ref&gt;See Weizacker, E. van, Lovins, A. and Lovins, H. (1997) ''Factor 4: Doubling Wealth – Halving Resource Use'', Earthscan, London, UK.  Hawken, P., Lovins, A and Lovins, H. (1999) ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution'', Earthscan, London, UK.  It is a widely cited claim that design is only about one percent of the total cost of the building, yet can save fifty to ninety percent of the total operating cost of a building.&lt;/ref&gt; Exposing the research and reasoning behind decision and design concepts facilitates input from community, assessors and independent experts, and should therefore occur be undertaken in development project. Being affordable and flexible, it is also easily adapted to developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;An example EDR process was created for Bogota based on a study of cultural, economic, social, ecological and other special needs.  This is not yet published.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design Strategies ===
Eco-positive retrofitting is a priority PD strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2009) ‘Eco-Retrofitting with Building Integrated Living’, in ''Smart and Sustainable Built Environment Conference Proceedings''. Delft, Netherlands. www.sasbe2009.com/ accessed May 2011; ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 23-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the massive ongoing impacts of buildings, biophysical sustainability is impossible without retrofitting cities.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP (2013) ''Buildings and Climate Change: Summary for Decision Makers'', United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Nairobi (by United Nations organizations and national building institutes).  UN-HABITAT (2011) ''Cities and Climate Change: Global Report on Human Settlements''. http://www.unhabitat.org/downloads/docs/GRHS2011_Full.pdf/ accessed July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Replacing buildings with greener ones costs too much in materials, money, energy and time, as new buildings represent only 1-3% of the building stock.  It is now accepted that retrofitting can be profitable in resource, energy, health savings and worker productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Romm, J. (1999) ''Cool Companies: How the Best Businesses Boost Profits and Productivity by Cutting Greenhouse Emissions'', Island Press, Washington, DC.;  EPA (1998) Market Values for Home Energy Efficiency (study by Nevin and Watson for the USA Environmental Protection Agency), Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; It can happen quickly and simultaneously, or when buildings are repurposed or refurbished anyway.  Green buildings may last a hundred years but few are designed for upgrading/adaptability, so they will soon need retrofitting to a higher standard.

== Design Assessment ==
Most rating tools prioritize resource efficiency and treat ‘reductions in negative impacts’ as if positive.  Their baselines and benchmarks preclude net-positive impacts.  Some provisions consider respective rights/responsibilities, but not broader ethical issues like improving human-nature relationships, reducing total resource flows or increasing social capital in the vicinity. Also, innovation is often valued for its own sake, not outcomes, and eco-efficiency saves owners money anyway. PD’s ‘hierarchy of eco-innovation’ analysis instead prioritizes positive system-wide outcomes and net public benefits.&lt;ref&gt;The PD ‘hierarchy of eco-innovation’ is summarized in Birkeland, J. (2008) ''Positive Development'', ''Ibid,'' pp. 240-242.&lt;/ref&gt; Being non-numerical, it allows self-assessment during design when scientific data is unavailable, time and ego has vested or irreversible decisions are made.

=== PD Starfish ===
The PD ‘starfish’ design and rating tool enables quantification while assisting designers to consider more dimensions of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Birkeland, J. (2010) ‘Starfish Tool for Net Positive Design’, Presentation at ''Positive Communities'', DEEDI (Queensland Government), Brisbane;  Birkeland, J. (2012) ‘Design blindness in Sustainable Development: From Closed to Open Systems Design Thinking’, in ''The Journal of Urban Design'', 17(2), 163-187. (Note the tool is elaborated in a forthcoming book).&lt;/ref&gt; It is a modified radar diagram with added layers and satellite diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;Radar diagrams are standard spreadsheet tools.&lt;/ref&gt; Since most life cycle assessment tools estimate impacts between ‘-1’ (bad) to ‘0’ (best) or zero impact, eco-positive public benefits are excluded.  Unlike rating tools, benchmarks for different sustainability factors are based on fixed biophysical conditions - not typical buildings, sites or practices.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, D and R. Simpson (2012) ''D_City: Digital Earth/Virtual Nations/Data Cities - Connecting Global Futures for Environmental Planning'', D. Jackson and R. Simpson, E-book, http://dcitynetwork.net/manifesto/; Birkeland, J. (2012) ‘The Eco-Positive Design Tool’, in ''Solar Progress'', Journal of the Australian Solar Energy Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The starfish uses one scale to assess impacts in relation to fixed benchmarks (from ‘-1’ to ‘+1’) and a linear scale on another layer for scoring/comparison purposes.

'''Psychological theories of magic''' treat magic as a personal phenomenon intended to meet individual needs, as opposed to a social phenomenon serving a collective purpose.  

==Theories==
===Psychosis===

Among the earliest psychological theories is the psychosis theory, advanced by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S.  Totem and taboo: Resemblances between the psychic lives of savages and neurotics.  London: Routledge Kegan Paul (1960).  (Original work published 1913).&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, “primitive man” is not a rational being, and in fact [[magical thinking]] bears a strong resemblance to neuroses. However, this conclusion has come into question, as more recent psychological theory acknowledges that psychological testing does not cross cultures with complete accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Gleitman, H., Reisberg, D., &amp; Gross, J.  Psychology, 7th edition.  New York, NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Co (2007). &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Bad science===
In contrast, the “bad science” model claims that primitive man is rational, and magical beliefs come into existence as he tries to explain puzzling phenomena without enough information.  According to this theory, the magician is an early form of scientist who merely lacks adequate data.  In [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]’s version of this theory, the magician’s folly is in mistaking an ideal connection for a real one; the magician believes that thematically-linked items can influence one another by virtue of their similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Evans-Pritchard, E.E.  Theories of Primitive Religion.  Oxford: Oxford University Press (1977), p.p. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Azande]] rub crocodile teeth on banana plants to make them fruitful (because crocodile teeth grow continuously).  The property of [[fertility]] can spread from a symbol of fertility (the crocodile tooth) to the intended target (the banana tree).  Michael F. Brown observes that many Aguaruna taboos can be understood as preventing undesired connections. 

===Symbolic action===
The symbolic action theory understands magic as a course of action taken when there exists an emotional (psychological) need for action, but no practical option exists. In [[R.R. Marett]]’s example, it is a magical action when a man, betrayed by his mistress, gathers photographs of her and burns them.&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Marett.  The Threshold of Religion, 2nd edition.  (1914).  Summary courtesy of Evans-Pritchard, Theories of Primitive Religion, p.p. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation presents a modern analog of the [[voodoo doll]].  As Marett describes, if the emotional situation proves common enough, the response becomes a socially-codified norm which outsiders understand as magic and which Marett labels “developed magic”.  Claude Lévi-Strauss&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''The Effectiveness of Symbols.''&lt;/ref&gt; and Ariel Glucklich&lt;ref&gt;Glucklich, Ariel. ''The End of Magic.'' New York: Oxford University Press (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; expand upon symbolic theory, positing that magic can serve as a form of psychotherapy or [[New Age]] science,  accomplishing real results by what amounts to the [[placebo effect]]. The effects of such magic would be made real through its effect on the individual person as demonstrated in their life and actions.

===Anxiety relief===
According to theories of anxiety relief and control, people turn to magical beliefs when there exists a sense of uncertainty and potential danger and little to do about it.  Magic is used to restore a sense of control.  In support of this theory, research indicates that superstitious behavior is invoked more often in high stress situations, especially by people with a greater desire for control.&lt;ref&gt;Keinan, Giora.  ''The effects of stress and desire for control on superstitious behavior.'' Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin Vol. 28, No. 1.  Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that one reason (but not necessarily the only reason) for the persistence of magic rituals is that the ritual activates vigilance-precaution systems – that is to say, that the rituals prompt their own use by creating a feeling of insecurity and then proposing themselves as precautions.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal and Pierre Liénard.  ''Ritual behavior in obsessive and normal individuals.''  Association for Psychological Science (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pascal Boyer]] and Pierre Liénard propose that the shape rituals take results from goal demotion and attentional focus on lower level representation.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal and Pierre Liénard.  ''Ritual behavior in obsessive and normal individuals.''  Association for Psychological Science (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of representation were previously described by J.M. Zacks and [[Barbara Tversky]].&lt;ref&gt;Zacks, J.M. and B. Tversky.  ''Event structure in perception and conception.''  Psychological Bulletin, 127, 3-21.  (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; At the lowest level are simple gestures (such as putting the left foot in a shoe).  At the mid-level are behavioral episodes (such as putting one’s shoes on). At the highest level are scripts (such as getting dressed to go out). Ordinarily, people describe and recall behavior in terms of the middle level of behavioral episodes{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}.  In studies of [[obsessive-compulsive]] rituals, focus shifts to the lower level of gestures, resulting in goal demotion. For example, an obsessive-compulsive cleaning ritual may overemphasize the order, direction, and number of wipes used to clean the surface.  The goal becomes less important than the actions used to achieve the goal, with the implication that magic rituals can persist without efficacy because the intent is lost within the act. Debate remains as to whether studies of obsessive-compulsive rituals can be extended to describe other kinds of rituals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1128">'''Purismo''' was an [[Italy|Italian]] cultural movement which began in the 1820s. The group intended to restore and preserve language through the study of medieval authors, and such study extended to the visual arts.

Inspired by the [[Nazarene movement|Nazarenes]] from Germany, the artists of Purismo reject [[Neoclassicism]] and emulated the works of [[Raphael]], [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] and [[Fra Angelico]].

The group's ideals were iterated in their manifesto ''Del purismo nelle arti'', in 1842–43 which was written by [[Antonio Bianchini]] and co-signed by [[Tommaso Minardi]] (1787–1871), the major proponent of Purismo, Nazarene co-founder [[Johann Friedrich Overbeck|Friedrich Overbeck]] and [[Pietro Tenerani]].

The movement flourished through 1860, and reflected the taste for revivalist styles, which in Italy was fed growing interest in Italian national identity and artistic heritage.

{{original research|date=August 2018}}
The '''satire boom''' is a general term to describe the emergence of a generation of English [[satirical]] writers, journalists and performers at the end of the 1950s. The  satire boom is often regarded as having begun with the first performance of ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' on 22 August 1960 and ending around December 1963 with the cancellation of the TV show ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''. The figures most closely identified with it are [[Peter Cook]], [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], [[John Fortune]], [[David Frost]], [[Bernard Levin]] and [[Richard Ingrams]]. Many of the figures who found initial celebrity through the satire boom went on to establish subsequently more serious careers as writers including [[Alan Bennett]] ([[drama]]), [[Jonathan Miller]] ([[polymath]]ic), and [[Paul Foot (journalist)|Paul Foot]] ([[investigative journalism]]).

In his book ''The Neophiliacs'' [[Christopher Booker]], who as a founding editor of ''[[Private Eye]]'' was a central figure of the satire boom, charts the years  1959 to 1964. He begins with the [[Cambridge Footlights]] student [[revue]] ''The Last Laugh'' written by Bird and Cook. It transferred to a [[West End theatre]]. Booker ends the period with the cancellation of the television series ''That Was The Week That Was'', and the closing  of the [[The Establishment (club)|Establishment]] Club.

The boom was driven by well-connected graduates from first the [[University of Cambridge]], and then the [[University of Oxford]]. Booker argues that, with the response to the [[Suez Crisis]] which effectively marked the end of the [[British Empire]] as a [[great power]], an [[upper middle class]] generation with [[independent school (UK)|public school]] and Oxbridge educations who had grown up with certain expectations &amp;mdash; of following a career in colonial administration or the [[British Civil Service|civil service]] &amp;mdash; suddenly found themselves surplus. Peter Cook had already entered for a [[Foreign Office]] entrance exam, before his stage career took off. At the same time the emergence of the "[[angry young men]]" and "[[kitchen sink realism]]" in drama were signs that the democratisation of British culture was increasingly dominated by the concerns of the "common man". The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was proving to be an ineffective opposition to a [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] Conservative government.{{cn|date=March 2017}} The satire-boom generation were in general apolitical or had (at that time) left-of-centre tendencies.

[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Jean Miélot]], a European author and scribe at work]]
[[File:Scribes with typewriters outside Post Office, Mandi.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern scribes with typewriters outside post office, [[Mandi, Himachal Pradesh]], India, 2010.]]

A '''scribe''' is a person who serves as a professional [[copyist]], especially one who made copies of manuscripts before the invention of [[Printing press|automatic printing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/scribe|title=the definition of scribe|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profession, previously widespread across cultures, lost most of its prominence and status with the advent of the [[Printing press|printing press.]] The work of scribes can involve copying manuscripts and other texts as well as secretarial and administrative duties such as the taking of dictation and keeping of business, judicial, and historical records for [[king]]s, [[nobility|nobles]], [[temple]]s, and [[City|cities]]. The profession has developed into [[Civil service|public servant]]s, [[journalist]]s, [[accountant]]s, [[Audio typist|typist]]s, and [[lawyer]]s. In societies with low literacy rates, street-corner letter-writers (and readers) may still be found providing scribe service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/11/1055220661012.html|title=Women of letters doing write for the illiterate - smh.com.au|website=www.smh.com.au|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Egypt==
[[File:GD-EG-Louxor-126.JPG|thumb|300px|Egyptian scribe with [[papyrus]] scroll]]
One of the most important   professionals in ancient Egypt was a person educated in the arts of writing (both [[hieroglyphics]] and [[hieratic]] scripts, as well as the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] script from the second half of the first millennium BCE, which was mainly used as shorthand and for commerce) and arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rice|first1=Michael|title=Who's Who in Ancient Egypt|date=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415154482|page=lvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Damerow|first1=Peter|title=Abstraction and Representation: Essays on the Cultural Evolution of Thinking|date=1996|publisher=Kluwer|location=[[Dordrecht]]|isbn=978-0792338161|pages=188–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sons of scribes were brought up in the same scribal tradition, sent to school, and inherited their fathers' positions upon entering the civil service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carr|first1=David M.|title=Writing on the Tablet of the Heart: Origins of Scripture and Literature|date=2005|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0195172973|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of what is known about ancient Egypt is due to the activities of its scribes and the officials. Monumental buildings were erected under their supervision,&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kemp|first1=Barry J. |author-link=Barry J. Kemp |title=Ancient Egypt: Anatomy of a Civilization|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415235495|page=180|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; administrative and economic activities were documented by them, and stories from Egypt's lower classes and foreign lands survive due to scribes putting them in writing.&lt;ref name="Kemp"/&gt;{{rp|296}}

[[File:Ancient Egyptian Scribe's palette HARGM7677.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ancient Egyptian scribe's palette with five depressions for pigments and four styli]]
Scribes were considered part of the royal court, were not [[conscription|conscripted]] into the army, did not have to pay taxes, and were exempt from the heavy manual labor required of the lower classes ([[corvée]] labor). The scribal profession worked with painters and artisans who decorated [[relief]]s and other building works with scenes, personages, or hieroglyphic text. 

&lt;div&gt;The hieroglyph used to [[scribe equipment (hieroglyph)|signify the scribe]], ''to write'' and ''writings'', etc., is [[Gardiner's sign list|Gardiner sign]] Y3, &lt;hiero&gt;Y3&lt;/hiero&gt; from the category of 'writings, &amp; music'. The hieroglyph contains the scribe's ink-mixing palette, a vertical case to hold writing-reeds, and a leather pouch to hold the black and red ink blocks.&lt;/div&gt; The demotic scribes used rush pens which had stems thinner than that of a reed (2 mm). The end of the rush was cut obliquely and then chewed, so that the fibers became separated. The result was a short, stiff brush which was handled in the same manner as that of a calligrapher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Willy |last=Clarysse |title=Egyptian Scribes Writing Greek |journal=Chronique d'Egypte |volume=68 |issue=135–136 |date=1993 |pages=186–201 |doi=10.1484/J.CDE.2.308932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thoth]] was the god credited with the invention of writing by the ancient Egyptians. He was the scribe of the gods who held knowledge of scientific and moral laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Budge|first1=E. A. Wallis|authorlink=E. A. Wallis Budge|title=The Gods of the Egyptians|date=1969|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=978-0486220550}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}}

==Egyptian and Mesopotamian functions==

In addition to accountancy and governmental politicking, the scribal professions branched out into literature. The first stories were probably creation stories and religious texts. Other genres evolved, such as [[wisdom literature]], which were collections of the philosophical sayings from wise men. These contain the earliest recordings of societal thought and exploration of ideas in some length and detail.

In [[Mesopotamia]] during the middle to late 3rd millennium BCE, the [[Sumer|Sumerians]] originated some of this literature in the form of a series of debates. Among the list of [[Sumerian disputations]] is the ''[[Debate between bird and fish]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.5.3.5&amp;display=Crit&amp;charenc=j&amp;lineid=t535.p2#t535.p2 |title=The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature |website=Etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Sumerian examples include the ''[[Debate between Summer and Winter]]'' where Winter wins, and disputes between the cattle and grain, the tree and the reed, silver and copper, the pickaxe and the plough, and the millstone and the gul-gul stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.5.3 |title=The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature |website=Etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Ancient Egyptian version is [[Dispute between a man and his Ba|''The Dispute between a man and his Ba'']], which comes from the Middle Kingdom period.

==Judaism==
As early as the 11th century BCE, scribes in [[Ancient Israel]], were distinguished professionals who would exercise functions which today could be associated with lawyers, journalists, government ministers, judges, or financiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hebrew.htm |title=Hebrew language, alphabet and pronunciation |website=Omniglot.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scribes also copied documents, but this was not necessarily part of their job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metzger|first1=Bruce M.|last2=Coogan|first2=Michael D.|title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780195046458|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Tomb of Ezekiel.jpg|thumb|left|Jewish scribes at the Tomb of Ezekiel in Iraq, ca. 1914]]
The Jewish scribes used the following rules and procedures while creating copies of the Torah and eventually other books in the [[Tanakh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scottmanning.com/content/process-of-copying-the-old-testament-by-jewish-scribes/ |title=Process of copying the Old Testament by Jewish Scribes |last=Manning |first=Scott |date=17 March 2007 |access-date=9 July 2018 |website=Historian on the Warpath}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# They could only use clean animal skins, both to write on, and even to bind manuscripts.
# Each column of writing could have no less than forty-eight, and no more than sixty lines.
# The ink must be black, and of a special recipe.
# They must say each word aloud while they were writing.
# They must wipe the pen and wash their entire bodies before writing the most Holy Name of God, [[YHVH]], every time they wrote it.
# There must be a review within thirty days, and if as many as three pages required corrections, the entire manuscript had to be redone.
# The letters, words, and paragraphs had to be counted, and the document became invalid if two letters touched each other. The middle paragraph, word and letter must correspond to those of the original document.
# The documents could be stored only in sacred places (synagogues, etc.).
# As no document containing God's Word could be destroyed, they were stored, or buried, in a [[genizah]].
===Sofer===
{{main|Sofer (scribe)}}
Sofers ({{lang-he|סופר סת”ם}}) are among the few scribes that still ply their trade by hand, writing on [[parchment]]. Renowned [[calligrapher]]s, they produce the [[Hebrew]] [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] and other holy texts.
====Accuracy====
{{further|Dead Sea Scrolls}}

Until 1948, the oldest known manuscripts of the [[Hebrew Bible]] dated back to CE 895. In 1947, a shepherd boy discovered some scrolls dated between 100 BCE and CE 100, inside a cave west of the [[Dead Sea]]. Over the next decade, more scrolls were found in caves and the discoveries became known collectively as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. Every book in the [[Hebrew Bible]] was represented except [[Esther]]. Numerous copies of each book were discovered, including 25 copies of the book of [[Deuteronomy]].

While there are other items found among the Dead Sea Scrolls not currently in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and many variations and errors occurred while they were copied down, the texts on the whole testify to the accuracy of the scribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Paul|title=A History of the Jews|date=1993|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|isbn=978-1857990966|page=91|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dead Sea Scrolls are currently the best route of comparison to the accuracy and consistency of translation for the [[Hebrew Bible]] because they are the oldest out of any [[Bible|Biblical text]] currently known.
====Corrections by the scribes and editing biblical literature====
Priests who took over the leadership of the Jewish community preserved and edited biblical literature. Biblical literature became a tool that legitimated and furthered the priests' political and religious authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/origins-written-bible.html |title=Origins of the Written Bible |first=William M. |last=Schniedewind |author-link=William M. Schniedewind |date=18 November 2008 |access-date=9 July 2018 |website=[[PBS Online]] |publisher=Nova}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrections by the scribes ([[Tiqqun soferim|Tikkunei Soferim]]) refers to changes that were made in the original wording of the Hebrew Bible wording during the second temple period, perhaps sometime between 450 and 350 BCE. One of the most prominent men at this time was [[Ezra|Ezra the scribe]]. He also hired scribes to work for him, in order to write down and revise the oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://booksnthoughts.com/ezra-changed-the-torah-text/ |title=Ezra changed the Torah text |first=Israel |last=Drazin |date=26 August 2015 |access-date=9 July 2018 |website=Jewish Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ezra and the scribes had completed the writing, Ezra gathered the Jews who had returned from exile, all of whom belonged to [[Kohen|Kohanim]] families. Ezra read them an unfamiliar version of the Torah. This version was different from the Torah of their fathers. Ezra did not write a new bible. Through the genius of his ‘editing’ he presented the religion in a new light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Okouneff |title=The Wrong Scribe: The Scribe Who Revised the King David Story |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=3XFdjwEACAAJ |publisher=[[CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform]] |date=23 January 2016 |pages=146 |editor-first=John |editor-last=Greenburg |isbn=9781523640430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-who-wrote-the-torah-1.5318582 |title=Who Wrote the Torah? |last=Gilad |first=Elon |date=22 October 2014 |access-date=9 July 2018 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe in the Middle Ages==

===Monastic scribes===
In the [[Middle Ages]] every book was made by hand. Specially trained monks, or scribes, had to carefully cut sheets of parchment, make the ink, write the script, bind the pages, and create a cover to protect the script. This was all accomplished in a monastic writing room called a [[scriptorium]] which was kept very quiet so scribes could maintain concentration.&lt;ref name=" Pavlik, McIntosh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pavlik|first1=John|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shawn|title=Converging Media: A New Introduction to Mass Communication|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780190271510|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large scriptorium may have up to forty scribes working.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Scribes woke to morning bells before dawn and worked until the evening bells, with a lunch break in between. They worked every day except for the [[Sabbath]].&lt;ref name="Lyons"/&gt; The primary purpose of these scribes was to promote the ideas of the Christian Church, so they mostly copied classical and religious works. The scribes were required to copy works in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew whether or not they understood the language.&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt;These re-creations were often written in calligraphy and featured rich illustrations, making the process incredibly time consuming. Scribes had to be familiar with the writing technology as well. They had to make sure that the lines were straight and the letters were the same size in each book that they copied. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707023033|title=Books : a living history|last=Martyn.|first=Lyons,|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|isbn=9781606060834|location=Los Angeles|oclc=707023033}}&lt;/ref&gt; It typically took a scribe fifteen months to copy a Bible.&lt;ref name="Lyons"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|pages=36–38, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such books were written on parchment or vellum made from treated hides of sheep, goats, or calves. These hides were often from the monastery's own animals as monasteries were self sufficient in raising animals, growing crops, and brewing beer.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  The overall process was too extensive and costly for books to become widespread during this period.&lt;ref name=" Pavlik, McIntosh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pavlik|first1=John|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shawn|title=Converging Media: A New Introduction to Mass Communication|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780190271510|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although scribes were only able to work in daylight, due to the expense of candles and the rather poor lighting they provided, monastic scribes were still able to produce three to four pages of work per day.&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt; The average scribe could copy two books a year.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P.|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602397064|page=33–34|ref=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were expected to make at least one mistake per page.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Female Scribes===
Women also played a role as scribes in Anglo-Saxon England, as religious women in convents and schools were literate. Excavations at medieval convents have uncovered [[styli]], indicating that writing and copying were done at those locations.&lt;ref&gt;https://thenewinquiry.com/blog/women-scribes-the-technologists-of-the-middle-ages/&lt;/ref&gt; Also, female pronouns are used in prayers in manuscripts from the late 8th century, suggesting that the manuscripts were originally written by and for female scribes.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2017/03/female-scribes-in-early-manuscripts-.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Town scribe==
The scribe was a common job in medieval towns during the 10th and 11th centuries. Many would be employed at scriptoria owned by local schoolmasters or lords. These scribes would be working under deadlines to complete commissioned works such as historic chronicles or poetry. Because parchment was quite costly, the scribe would often create a draft of the work first on a wax or chalk tablet.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart. (2009). ''The Library: An Illustrated History.'' Skyhorse Publishing: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8295">'''Slow reading''' is the intentional reduction in the speed of [[reading (process)|reading]], carried out to increase comprehension or pleasure. The concept appears to have originated in the study of [[philosophy]] and [[literature]] as a technique to more fully comprehend and appreciate a complex [[Text (literary theory)|text]]. More recently, there has been increased interest in slow reading as result of the [[Slow movement (culture)|slow movement]] and its focus on decelerating the pace of modern life. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Related terms ==

The use of slow reading in literary criticism is sometimes referred to as [[close reading]]. Of less common usage is the term, "deep reading".&lt;ref name=Birkerts1994 &gt;Birkerts, Sven. (1994). ''The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate of Reading in an Electronic Age''. Boston: Faber and Faber.  [http://archives.obs-us.com/obs/english/books/nn/bdbirk.htm Selected passages], Open Book Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; Slow reading is contrasted with [[speed reading]] which involves techniques to increase the rate of reading without adversely affecting comprehension, and contrasted with [[Skimming (reading)|skimming]]  which employs visual page cues to increase reading speed. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Philosophy and literature ==

The earliest reference to slow reading appears to be in [[Nietzsche]]'s  preface to the 1887 ''[[The Dawn (book)|Daybreak]]'': "It is not for nothing that one has been a [[Philology|philologist]], perhaps one is a philologist still, that is to say, a teacher of slow reading."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Nietzsche]],  (1887) ''Morgenro:te: Gedanken u:ber die moralischen Vorurteile'' (1881). "Man ist nicht umsonst Philologe gewesen, man ist es vielleicht noch, das will sagen, ein Lehrer des langsamen Lesens: - endlich schreibt man auch langsam."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich (1887)''Daybreak: Thoughts on the Prejudices of Morality''. 2nd Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sven Birkerts|Birkerts]], in his book ''The Gutenberg Elegies'', stated "Reading, because we control it, is adaptable to our needs and rhythms. We are free to indulge our subjective associative impulse; the term I coin for this is deep reading: the slow and meditative possession of a book."&lt;ref name=Birkerts1994 /&gt;  Birkerts' emphasis  on the importance of personal control over the speed of reading is echoed by [[Philip Pullman|Pullman]], who additionally argued that taking control of the pace of one's reading is a form of personal freedom, and develops an appreciation of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Pullman, P. (2004). The War on Words. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/politicsphilosophyandsociety/story/0,,1344082,00.html ''Guardian Review''], November 6, 2004. On-line&lt;/ref&gt;   A similar view was stated by [[Neil Postman|Postman]], who noted the character of the ordinary citizen of the 19th century, a mind that could listen for hours on end to political orations clearly shaped by a culture favouring text. Postman warns that reading books is important for developing rational thinking and political astuteness.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil (1985). ''Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business''. NY: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindsay Waters, Executive Editor for the Humanities at [[Harvard University Press]], declared a worldwide reading crisis resulting from our global push toward productivity. He asserts that young children are learning to read faster, skipping phonetics and diagramming sentences, and concludes that these children will not grow up to read [[John Milton|Milton]]. He foresees the end of graduate English literature programs. "There is something similar between a reading method that focuses primarily on the bottom-line meaning of a story in a novel and the economic emphasis on the bottom line that makes automobile manufacturers speed up assembly lines." He advised re-introducing time into reading: "The mighty imperative is to speed everything up, but there might be some advantage in slowing things down. People are trying slow eating. Why not slow reading?" &lt;ref&gt;Waters, Lindsay (2007), Time for Reading, [http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i23/23b00601.htm ''Chronicle of Higher Education''],  53(23). On-line (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slow movement==
[[Carl Honoré]], an advocate of the [[Slow movement (culture)|slow movement]], discusses slow reading in his book ''In Praise of Slow''.&lt;ref&gt;Honoré, Carl (2004). [url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gb0_TtNFwPYC ''In Praise of Slow: How a Worldwide Movement is Changing the Cult of Speed'']. Vintage Canada. pages 227-229&lt;/ref&gt;  He recommends slow reading as one of several practices to decelerate from the fast pace of modern life.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Lane (2005). Slow Is Beautiful: Living as If Life Really Mattered. ''Futurist'', ''39''(2) (Mar/Apr 2005): p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Laura Casey points out that the increasing availability of instant communication technologies, such as [[Text messaging|texting]] and social media like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], may be contributing to the decline of slow reading.&lt;ref&gt;Casey, Laura (January 5, 2011). Is deep reading in trouble?[http://www.insidebayarea.com/argus/ci_17008403 Contra Costa Times].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, novelist I. Alexander Olchowski founded the Slow Book Movement to advocate for reading practices related to the slow movement, including reading light material at a relaxed pace for pleasure, reading complex materials slowly for insight, reading materials of local interest and by local authors, and community building around local libraries and reading events.

== Research ==

While there is substantial research about involuntary slow reading, which can arise from a lack of fluency and is a predictor of [[dyslexia]],&lt;ref&gt;Wimmer, Heinz (1996). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00555368 "The Early Manifestation of Developmental [[Dyslexia]]: Evidence from German children"]. ''Reading and Writing'', 8(2).&lt;/ref&gt; there are a few studies which demonstrate the positive value of voluntary slow reading. Nell (1988) showed that there is substantial rate variability during natural reading, with most-liked pages being read significantly slower.&lt;ref&gt;Nell, V. (1988). The Psychology of Reading for Pleasure: Needs and Gratifications. ''Reading Research Quarterly'', Vol. 23, No. 1 (Winter, 1988), pp. 6-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Sherry Jr. and Schouten (2002) suggested that close reading could have commercial application as a research method for the use of poetry in marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Sherry, John F, Jr. and Schouten John W. (2002). A Role for Poetry in Consumer Research. ''Journal of Consumer Research'', 29(2), 218-234.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocates of speed-reading point out that [[subvocalization]] slows the speed of reading,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0-9934964-0-0|edition=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cEFKjwEACAAJ&amp;dq=ultimate+study+method&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; but studies by Carver found no other observable negative effect on the reading process, and observed that the slower pace seemed to improve comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, Ronald, P. (1990). ''Reading Rate: A Review of Research and Theory''. San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute''' ('''STRI''', {{lang-es|Instituto Smithsonian de Investigaciones Tropicales}}) is the only bureau of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] based outside of the United States, in [[Panama]]. It is dedicated to understanding the past, present and future of tropical ecosystems and their relevance to human welfare. STRI grew out of a small field station established in 1923 on [[Barro Colorado Island]] in the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to become one of the world's leading tropical research organizations. STRI's facilities provide for long-term ecological studies in the tropics and are used by some 1,200 visiting scientists from academic and research institutions around the world every year.

==History==
[[File:Barro Colorado Research.JPG|thumb|right|Barro Colorado Research Station]]
Smithsonian scientists first came to Panama during the construction of the [[Panama Canal]] from 1904 to 1914. 
The Secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], [[Charles Doolittle Walcott]], reached an agreement with [[Federico Boyd]] to conduct a biological inventory of the new Canal Zone in 1910, and this survey was subsequently extended to include all of Panama. Thanks largely to their efforts, the governor of the Canal Zone declared Barro Colorado Island (BCI) a biological reserve in 1923,&lt;ref name="SIA1"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=1975 | title=Oral history interview with Charles F. Bennett, Jr., and Anna Carole Bennett, 1975 | work= | publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Archives]] | url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217731 | accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it one of the earliest biological reserves in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_16/issue_08/nature_11.html | title=100 years of the Smithsonian's relationship with Panama | author=Eric Jackson | work=The Panama News | date=August 5, 2010 | accessdate=August 8, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614060302/http://www.thepanamanews.com/pn/v_16/issue_08/nature_11.html | archivedate=June 14, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s and 1930s BCI, in [[Gatun Lake]], became an outdoor laboratory for scientists from U.S. universities and the Smithsonian Institution. By 1940, when BCI was designated the Canal Zone Biological Area (CZBA), more than 300 scientific publications had described the biota of BCI. In the Government Reorganization Act of 1946, BCI became a bureau of the Smithsonian Institution. The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) was created in 1966.&lt;ref name="SIA1"/&gt;

With the establishment of STRI, permanent staff scientists were hired and fellowship programs were initiated to support aspiring tropical biologists. The first director after the name change was [[Martin Humphrey Moynihan]].&lt;ref name="SIA1"/&gt; A strong relationship with the Republic of Panama was formalized in the [[Panama Canal Treaties]] of 1977, which gradually transferred control of the Canal Zone to Panama. The treaties created the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, which included BCI and five surrounding peninsulas, and granted STRI custody of the monument. Panama granted STRI International Mission status in 1985 and, in 1997, the nation extended STRI's custodianship of facilities beyond the culmination of the Panama Canal Treaties in 1999.

STRI's first director after the institute's establishment in 1966 was Martin Humphrey Moynihan. Geographer and scientist Charles F. Bennett, along with his wife, Anna Carole Bennett, participated in STRI during the 1960s, assisting in the organizing of the library, researching and collecting [[microclimate]] data, and studying [[neotropical]] forests. In 1966, Bennett became an honorary Research Associate of STRI.&lt;ref name="SIA1" /&gt; A large collection of papers by STRI researchers at Barro Colorado Island was published as an anthology in 1982, ''The Ecology of a Tropical Rainforest''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = P. J. Edwards | year = 1985 | title = Leigh, E.G., Jr., Rand, A. S. &amp; Windsor D. M. (Eds) The Ecology of a Tropical Forest (review) | journal = Journal of Ecology | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | page = 368 | doi = 10.2307/2259799 | jstor =  2259799 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

STRI has an average of 350 ongoing research projects and publishes more than 400 peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stri.si.edu/about-us|title=About Us|last=|first=|date=2016-12-19|work=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
STRI's research facilities allow staff scientists, fellows and visiting scientists to achieve their research objectives. Most of STRI's staff scientists reside in the tropics and are encouraged to pursue their own research priorities without geographic limitations. The continuity of their long-term programs enables in-depth investigations that attract an elite group of fellows and visitors. Active support for fellows and visitors leverages resources further and attracts more than 1,200 scientists to STRI each year.

==Academic programs==
STRI hosts 10-15 university field courses every year. Participating universities include Princeton, McGill, Northeastern, Wisconsin Green Bay, Yale, Harvard, Ohio State, Arizona State, Marquette, Texas A&amp;M Butler, Cambridge, Dartmouth College and University of Vermont. STRI also runs an intensive field course for Panamanian and Central American undergraduates. Since 1965, STRI has supported some 5,500 fellows and interns of various academic levels, from undergraduate, master and PhD students, to postdoctoral and senior researchers.

==Barro Colorado Nature Monument==
The Barro Colorado Nature Monument includes the 16&amp;nbsp;km² [[Barro Colorado Island]], which is covered with tropical forest and boasts a nearly intact mammal fauna. It also includes 40&amp;nbsp;km² of surrounding mainland peninsulas covered by forests in various stages of succession, serving as a site for manipulative field experiments. The monument adjoins Panama's 220&amp;nbsp;km² [[Soberania National Park]].

With an unparalleled store of background information reflecting almost a century of research in a protected setting, Barro Colorado Island has become a major global center for tropical research.

Barro Colorado is open for public day visits, but advance reservations must be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stri.si.edu/visit/barro-colorado|title=Visit Us at Barro Colorado|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=stri.si.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/mexico-and-central-america/panama/the-canal-and-central-panama/review-453607.html|title=Isla Barro Colorado Review &amp;#124; The Canal and Central Panama &amp;#124; Fodor's Travel Guides|date=|publisher=Fodors.com|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other research sites==
Although STRI is based in Panama, research is conducted throughout the tropics. The Smithsonian's Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO) network uses standard study protocols to monitor 66 tree plots in 27 countries across Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. The protocols were developed on BCI in the early 1980s. More than six million individual trees representing 10,000 species are being studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://forestgeo.si.edu|title=ForestGEO|website=ForestGEO|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STRI's Biological Diversity of Forest Fragments project created experimental forest fragments of 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0&amp;nbsp;km² to study the consequences of landscape transformation on forest integrity in the central Amazon region. STRI marine scientists are conducting a global survey of levels of genetic isolation in coral reef organisms.

=== Facilities in Panama City ===
STRI is headquartered at the Earl S. Tupper Research, Library and Conference Center in [[Ancón, Panama|Ancón]], [[Panama City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stri.si.edu/facility/earl-s-tupper|title=Earl S. Tupper Center|last=|first=|date=2016-10-30|work=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; STRI has other installations around Panama City including the Center for Tropical Paleoecology and Archaeology, a Canopy Access Crane system in the Parque Natural Metropolitano (with a sister crane in the San Lorenzo National Park on Panama's Caribbean slope), and the Naos Marine and Molecular Laboratories on the Amador Causeway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stri.si.edu/facilities|title=STRI Facilities|last=|first=|date=2016-10-12|work=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marine laboratory has a dock, wet lab and scientific diving office, facilitating research in the Gulf of Panama.

The causeway, which is at the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal, is also home to STRI's visitor center, the Punta Culebra Nature Center, which is open year-round to the general public and school groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stri.si.edu/visit/punta-culebra|title=Punta Culebra Nature Center|last=|first=|date=2016-10-21|work=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facilities elsewhere in Panama===
STRI has laboratories in the town of Gamboa, which is abutted by Soberanía National Park, the Panama Canal and the Chagres River in central Panama. The Gamboa labs facilitate research on forest ecology, animal behavior, plant physiology, evolution and other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stri.si.edu/facility/gamboa|title=Gamboa Laboratories|last=|first=|date=2016-10-24|work=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjacent to Soberanía, STRI has the 700-hectare Panama Canal Watershed Experiment, which studies multiple land-use practices to determine their impact on hydrology, carbon storage and potential for reforestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stri.si.edu/facility/agua-salud|title=Agua Salud - Panama Canal Watershed Experiment|last=|first=|date=2016-10-22|work=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STRI has two Caribbean marine laboratories. One is the small facility of Punta Galeta Marine Laboratory near the city of Colón, at the Caribbean entrance to the Panama Canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stri.si.edu/facility/punta-galeta|title=Punta Galeta Marine Laboratory|last=|first=|date=2016-10-27|work=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is the [[Bocas del Toro Research Station]], a modern marine laboratory on [[Isla Colón]] within one mile of downtown [[Bocas Town, Bocas del Toro|Bocas del Toro]]. The research station has a dock, dive locker and a fleet of small research vessels that provide access to mangrove, seagrass and coral reef ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stri.si.edu/facility/bocas-del-toro|title=Bocas del Toro Research Station|last=|first=|date=2016-10-28|work=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fortuna Field Station provides access to montane forest in western Panama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stri.si.edu/facility/fortuna|title=Fortuna Field Station|last=|first=|date=2017-05-23|work=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STRI has a small field station is on the island of Coibita in Coiba National Park. The station provides access to the 500-km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Coiba Island and extensive coral reef systems of the Eastern Tropical Pacific&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stri.si.edu/facility/coibita-island|title=Coibita Island|last=|first=|date=2016-10-19|work=Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2043">In [[applied mathematics]], '''Strichartz estimates''' are a family of inequalities for linear [[dispersive partial differential equation]]s.  These inequalities establish size and decay of solutions in [[mixed norm]] [[Lp space|Lebesgue spaces]].  They were first noted by [[Robert Strichartz]] and arose out of contentions to the Fourier restriction problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=R.S. Strichartz|title=Restriction of Fourier Transform to Quadratic Surfaces and Decay of Solutions of Wave Equations|journal=Duke Math. J.|volume=44|year=1977|pages=705–713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Consider the linear [[Schrödinger equation]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; with ''h''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  Then the solution for initial data &lt;math&gt;u_0&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;e^{it\Delta/2}u_0&lt;/math&gt;.  Let ''q'' and ''r'' be real numbers satisfying &lt;math&gt;2\leq q, r \leq \infty&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{q}+\frac{d}{r}=\frac{d}{2}&lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt;(q,r,d)\neq(2,\infty,2)&lt;/math&gt;.  

In this case the homogeneous Strichartz estimates take the form:&lt;ref name=tao2006&gt;{{citation|author=Tao, Terence|title=Nonlinear dispersive equations: Local and global analysis|series=CBMS Regional Conference Series in Mathematics|volume=106|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8218-4143-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\|e^{it\Delta/2} u_0\|_{L^q_tL^r_x}\leq C_{d,q,r} \|u_0\|_2.&lt;/math&gt; 
Further suppose that &lt;math&gt;\tilde q, \tilde r&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the same restrictions as &lt;math&gt;q, r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde q', \tilde r'&lt;/math&gt; are their dual exponents, then the dual homogeneous Strichartz estimates take the form:&lt;ref name=tao2006 /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\| \int_\mathbb{R} e^{-is\Delta/2}F(s)\,ds\right\|_{L^2_x}\leq C_{d,\tilde q, \tilde r}\|F\|_{L^{\tilde q'}_tL^{\tilde r'}_x}.&lt;/math&gt;

The inhomogeneous Strichartz estimates are:&lt;ref name=tao2006 /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left\| \int_{s&lt;t} e^{-i(t-s)\Delta/2}F(s)\,ds\right\|_{L^q_tL^r_x}\leq C_{d, q,  r, \tilde q, \tilde r}\|F\|_{L^{\tilde q'}_tL^{\tilde r'}_x}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Teachinghistory.org''', also known as the '''National History Education Clearinghouse''' (NHEC), is a website that provides educational resources for the study of U.S. history.

== Organizational background ==
In the past decade and a half, three major developments have reshaped the landscape for [[K-12]] history education and have created the conditions for significant advances in history teaching and learning. First, the emergence of the Internet and the [[World Wide Web]] has brought unprecedented resources and possibilities to the computers of the nation's history teachers. Second, a body of serious scholarly research in history education – and the [[learning sciences]] more generally – has begun to illuminate how students actually learn history. Finally, the Department of Education's Teaching American History (TAH) program has invested more than $900 million in history education – the largest federal infusion of resources ever devoted to improving the teaching and learning of history.&lt;ref&gt;Melendez, Margarita L. [http://www2.ed.gov/programs/teachinghistory/shfg-article.pdf ''Teaching American History Article'']. The Society for History in the Federal Government newsletter, ''The Federalist,'' Fall 2008, Number 19, accessed May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to these advancements, the [[United States Department of Education]] announced a call for proposals in 2007 to address the building, populating, and maintaining of a central website for K-12 American history educators, funded under the Teaching American History Grant program (TAH). [[George Mason University's Center for History and New Media]] was awarded the grant for the website creation the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynewsnetwork.com/node/43381 "George Mason University Receives $7.5 Million to Create a National History Education Clearinghouse"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419013639/http://www.historynewsnetwork.com/node/43381 |date=2012-04-19 }}, ''[[History News Network]]'', October 3, 2007, accessed May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Walt. [http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/walt_gardners_reality_check/2011/06/ignorance_of_history_pervades_all_levels.html "Ignorance of History Permeates All Levels"], ''[[Education Week]]'', June 22, 2011, accessed August 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The TAH program is funded under Title II-C, Subpart 4 of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965]], as amended by the [[No Child Left Behind Act of 2001]]. According to the TAH program website, the goal of the program is to "raise student achievement by improving teachers’ knowledge, understanding, and appreciation of American history.&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Education, [http://www2.ed.gov/programs/teachinghistory/ ''Teaching American History''], accessed May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;"

== Organizational goals ==
One goal is to bring together K-12 American history resources to help educators find and use them. Another goal is to create materials that detail strategies for teaching and learning history to help educators improve classroom teaching. A third goal is to disseminate lessons learned by more than 900 Teaching American History (TAH) grants designed to raise student achievement by improving teachers' knowledge and understanding of traditional U.S. history.

Teachinghistory.org is updated regularly and is organized around six sections: History Content, Best Practices, Teaching Materials, Issues and Research, Teaching American History (TAH) Projects, and Digital Classroom. In addition, the website offers a weekly history quiz, a blog, and features that allow users to submit history content, history teaching, and digital history questions to experts in the field.

== Partners ==
With funding from the [[U.S. Department of Education]] under the Office of Innovation and Improvement, Teachinghistory.org, also known as the National History Education Clearinghouse, was developed through a collaboration between the Roy Rosenzweig [[Center for History and New Media]] (CHNM) at [[George Mason University]] and the Stanford History Education Group at [[Stanford University]].

CHNM and the Stanford History Education Group have worked on other projects together, including Historical Thinking Matters, a website focused on key topics in U.S. history that is designed to teach students how to critically read primary sources and how to critique and construct historical narratives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historicalthinkingmatters.org/about/ ''Historical Thinking Matters''], accessed May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by [[Roy Rosenzweig]], CHNM is an internationally recognized digital humanities center located in Fairfax, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hastac.org/centers-and-institutions/center-history-and-new-media ''Center for History and New Media''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721185337/http://www.hastac.org/centers-and-institutions/center-history-and-new-media |date=2011-07-21 }}. HASTAC, accessed May 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Created by Sam Wineburg, the Stanford History Education Group in Stanford, California, engages in projects at the forefront of how students learn history, from elementary school to college.

Additional Teachinghistory.org partners include the [[American Historical Association]], a professional organization for historians founded in 1884, and the National History Center, which promotes research, teaching, and learning in all fields of history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12914">'''Temperament Isolation Theory''', also known as personality bias or personality discrimination, is a recent{{when|date=May 2018}} [[social science]] theory that attempts to explain how cultures favor a specific [[temperament]] and how they view and interact with those of other or opposite temperaments. The first concepts of the theory were explored by Susan Cain in her book ''[[Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking|Quiet]]'' where she looked at how [[western culture]]s, particularly the United States, value [[extroversion]] over [[introversion]] and how that could possibly make it difficult for introverts to thrive in society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking|last = Cain|first = Susan|publisher = Crown Publishing Group|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Arizona University professor Jorge Rodriguez III took the idea a step further and viewed how the opposite could be viewed in eastern cultures where introversion is valued over extroversion. These observations and further research led to the concept of "personality bias" which suggests certain personalities are favored over others and that these opposing personalities are "intentionally or unintentionally oppressed or muted."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Personality Biases in Western and Eastern cultures|last = Rodriguez III|first = Jorge|date = 2013|journal = American Journal of Cultural Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of personality bias was later formally formulated into Temperament Isolation Theory. The theory is currently not widely accepted among social scientists, but it is gaining ground thanks to the research of Rodriguez and others.

== History/Origins  ==

The concept of personality bias was explored by Susan Cain in her book ''Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking,'' released in January, 2012. Cain explored how western cultures, particularly that of the United States, place much value on extroversion. The social structures of the U.S. including the workforce and public education encourage and teach people to be outspoken, engaging and group-minded. Cain refers to this bias as the "extrovert ideal" where people are valued for what they say and how they present themselves rather than their character, talents and skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She also discusses the rise of  collaboration and [[groupthink]] in the United States and how group work is seen as superior or more effective than individual contribution. Cain argues that the extrovert ideal has made it difficult for introverts to thrive and succeed in the United States.

Cain also introduced definitions and parameters for temperament. According to the Cain, temperament (extroversion and introversion) is a person's core personality and influences many of the traits the person develops over his or her lifetime. Temperament is not defined on how social a person is or on whether they are shy or not. Rather, temperament is influenced by sensory sensitivity. Introverts are highly sensitive to outside stimulus and can often be overwhelmed by it. Extroverts are much less sensitive to stimulus and often need more exposure to it in order to feel a response. For example, an introvert may feel overwhelmed at a rock concert because she is sensitive to all the stimuli (music, lights, voices, touch etc.) and she is taking all of it in at once, whereas an extrovert is not sensitive and wants to experience these stimuli even more. Cain also notes that temperament is a spectrum rather a definitive extreme. Some introverts are less sensitive than others and feel more comfortable in social situations and vice versa. People lean more towards introversion or extroversion and, in some cases, fall in the middle (ambivert). Temperament can also be situational in which a single individual may exhibit more extroverted or introverted traits in specific situations. 

Temperament as it pertains to eastern cultures is also briefly touched on by Cain. She notes that eastern cultures are the opposite of western cultures in that they tend to value introversion over extroversion. She specifically examined the experiences of Asian-American families. Asian-Americans struggle a lot in American society because their culture and home life encourage introversion, but their social lives outside the home put pressure on them to be extroverted. 

Susan Cain and her book ''Quiet'' are credited with starting what is called the "Quiet Revolution" which calls for introverts to learn to value and appreciate themselves and use their strengths to find their place in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.quietrev.com/about-us/|title = Quiet Revolution's Mission and Values|date = 2015|accessdate = |website = Quiet Revolution|publisher = |last = Cain|first = Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is rather small but is nonetheless designed to help introverts cope with inequalities and difficulties they face in an extroverted-dominated society. 

== Expansion and Social Scientific Research ==
Social Scientist and Associate Professor at Northern Arizona University Jorge Rodriguez III was intrigued by the ideas presented by Cain and began to research them scientifically in 2012. Rodriguez's research found that extroversion is indeed highly valued in the United States and that this value of extroversion often does come at the expense of marginalizing introverts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, Rodriguez believed this was mostly unintentional and some introverts have been successfully able to bypass the "personality bias" with strong, creative ideas and hard work ethic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Regardless, a personality does exist which can lead to the oppression of introverts.

Rodriguez took his research a step further and looked how personality bias differs among cultures. While Cain briefly touched on the subject in ''Quiet'', Rodriguez felt further research and observation was needed. Rodriguez found that eastern cultures, particularly that of Hong Kong, China, had a personality bias for introversion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike the U.S., China places more value on character and individual leadership. The good of organization or group, including the family, is much more important than individual desire and need. Being quite is seen as a symbol of wisdom, humility and selflessness. By contrast, extroversion can be viewed as a symbol arrogance and self-interest. Much like how the climate in the U.S. has marginalized introverts, the value of introversion in China has made difficult for extroverts to find respect and success. However, unlike the U.S. where this oppression is mostly unintentional, Rodriguez believes it is more deliberate in China as the culture has a spoken affliction towards extroverts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Rodriguez based much of his research in the concepts and ideas of other social scientific research and theory. In particular, Rodriguez used Muted Group Theory to see if temperaments can be muted/silenced much like other minority groups. While much less common and less extreme than with other minority groups based on sex and race, people of certain temperaments can indeed be muted by the dominant group, intentionally or unintentionally.

== Formulation of a Formal Theory ==
Not long after his research into personality bias, Rodriguez began work on the formulation of a formal theory. Using Muted Group Theory as the basis and incorporating the findings and observations of his research, Rodriguez formally introduced Temperament Isolation Theory in his book ''Temperament Isolation: The Study of Personality Bias in Culture''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Temperament Isolation: The Study of Personality Bias in Culture.|last = Rodriguez III|first = Jorge|publisher = Northern Arizona University Publishing|year = 2014|isbn = |location = Flagstaff, Arizona|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodriguez used the term temperament in his theory to emphasize that it covers "overall personality" and not "individual traits and idiosyncrasies."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He also wanted to use temperament to emphasize that extroversion and introversion are not a measure of sociability but "other factors that have the potential to affect how one socializes."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The term isolation is also used to show that oppression is not always intentional. The theory suggests that certain temperaments, relative to culture, are inherently favored over others and this favoritism can often lead to the muting or oppression of opposite temperaments which can then make living in this culture challenging, impeding their success and acceptance of their beliefs, behaviors and values.

Assumption of Temperament Isolation Theory:
* Cultures are naturally inclined to favor certain temperaments.
* Favoritism towards a temperament almost always results in the isolation of other temperaments, intentional or not.
* Temperament refers to overall personality.
* Temperaments are not a measure of sociability.
* Temperaments are biologic and fixed from birth like race and sex.
While personality bias is not viewed to be on the same scale as racial discrimination or sexism, Rodriguez argues that it is still a concern because temperament is biologically fixed like race and sex. While people may be able to adjust their behaviors and "mask" their true personalities but they cannot change their core temperament.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If a person is introverted, they will always be introverted and vice versa. Rodriguez did not formulate Temperament Isolation to be a critical theory, but he acknowledges that it might address social inequality issues.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://arizonaweeklysun.com/news/science/do-we-discriminate-by-personality/|title = Do we discriminate by personality?|last = Jackson|first = Brent|date = 2014|work = |access-date = |via = Arizona Sun Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expansion, Criticism and Future ==
Rodriguez plans to expand on the ideas of Temperament Isolation, particularly as it relates to other cultures. While most cultures can be divided into western and eastern, Rodriguez believes it may be more diverse than that. Rodriguez in particular wants to study Middle Eastern and South American cultures as he feels they don't quite align with the standard western and eastern distinctions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Rodriguez is also interested in researching the possibility of temperaments beyond introversion and extroversion. The idea of ambiversion is of particular interest as ambiverts are supposed to be sensory balanced.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Temperament Isolation Theory is not currently accepted as formal social science theory. Many sociologists feel the theory needs more concrete concepts and empirical data. Rodriguez's research and observations are considered preliminary and many feel there needs to be more measurable results (qualitative and quantitative) to support the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Current and upcoming research and topics in human communication|last = Grahamn|first = Derek R.|date = 2014|journal = Journal of Human Communication Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to preliminary nature of the theory, some sociologists suggest the idea of personality bias in itself is illogical. Critics feel Cain and Rodriguez are "over extending" by trying to suggest that discrimination or oppression of personality is similar to racial  discrimination or sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://socialsciencemag.com/news/opinions/personality_bias_is_absurd|title = Personality Bias is absurd|last = Fossett|first = James C.|date = 2015|work = |access-date = |via = Social Science Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Rodriguez's future research plans, other social scientists are exploring the idea of personality bias. Researchers like Janise Hoalburrough and Sean Greeson applied concepts of personality bias to workforce performance and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Temperament and workforce performance: factors, theories and findings|last = Greeson|first = Sean|date = 2014|journal = British Journal of Business Communication|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Hoalburrough|first2 = Janise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personality bias has also reinvigorated the study of personality and temperament by psychologists. Michelle Chavira recently published an article that explores new research in temperament and included some of Rodriguez's findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Re-evaluating temperament: biological and psychological factors|last = Chavira|first = Michelle|date = 2015|journal = American Journal of Behavioral Psychology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Cain is also continuing her "[http://www.quietrev.com/ Quiet Revolution]" where she attempts to empower introverts and help them find success.

'''''The Burlington Magazine''''' is a monthly publication that covers the [[fine art|fine]] and [[decorative arts]]. Established in 1903, it is the longest running art journal in the English language.&lt;ref&gt;T. Fawcett, 'Scholarly Journals', in: ''The Art Press – Two Centuries of Art Magazines'', London, 1976, pp. 3–10, {{ISBN|0-905309-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been published by a [[charitable organisation]] since 1986.

==History==
The magazine was established in 1903 by a group of art historians and connoisseurs which included [[Roger Fry]], [[Herbert Horne]], [[Bernard Berenson]], and [[Charles Holmes]]. Its most esteemed editors &lt;ref&gt;H. Rees Leahy. 'For Connoisseurs: The Burlington Magazine', in: ''Art History and its institutions'', London and New York, 2002, pp. 231–245&lt;/ref&gt; have been [[Roger Fry|Fry]] (1909–19), [[Herbert Read]] (1933–39), and [[Benedict Nicolson]] (1948–78).  The journal's structure was loosely based on its contemporary British publication ''[[The Connoisseur (magazine)|The Connoisseur]]'', which was mainly aimed at collectors and had firm connections with the art trade. ''The Burlington Magazine'', however, added to this late [[Victorian era|Victorian]] tradition of market-based criticism new elements of historical research inspired by the leading academic German periodicals and thus created a formula that has remained almost intact to date: a combination of archival and formalist object-based art historical research juxtaposed to articles on collectors’ items and private collections, enlivened with notes on current art news, exhibitions and sales.&lt;ref&gt;A. Burton, 'Nineteenth Century Periodicals', in: ''The Art Press – Two Centuries of Art Magazines'', London, 1976, pp. 3–10, {{ISBN|0-905309-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lavishness of this publication almost immediately created financial troubles and in January 1905&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Denys, Select Chronology--'Letters of Roger Fry ' ,Chatto and Windus, London, 1972 {{ISBN|0701115998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry embarked on an American tour to find sponsorship to assure the survival of the journal,&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Holmes, ''Self and partners (Mostly self)'', London, 1936, pp. 213–34, {{ISBN|1-4067-6927-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he had quickly recognized as a magazine for the developing study of art history.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Denys Introduction-'Letters of Roger Fry', Chatto and Windus,London, 1972 {{ISBN|0701115998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
From its first editorial, ''The Burlington Magazine'' presented itself as synthesising opposing traditions – historicist versus aestheticism and academic versus commercial – by defining itself an exponent of "Austere Epicureanism".&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, ‘Editorial Article’, ''The Burlington Magazine'', 1 (March 1903), pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; Against the perceived "sameness" of the contemporary art panorama, ''The Burlington Magazine'' was to act as a disinterested guide, directing the public's attention to high-quality art on offer both on the market and on institutional settings and educating its readers on the elevating qualities of ancient art.&lt;ref&gt;A. Helmreich, ‘The Death of the Victorian Art Periodical’, ''Visual Resources'', 26, no. 3, (September 2010), pp. 242–253&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Burlington Magazine'' editors and contributors were part of the institutional sphere of museums and academia and yet, unlike their German counterparts, they participated in the emerging world of the commercial galleries.&lt;ref&gt;T. Fawcett, 'Scholarly Journals', in: ''The Art Press – Two Centuries of Art Magazines'', London, 1976, pp. 3–10, {{ISBN|0-905309-00-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine remained independent from any institution and yet it was instrumental in the establishment of academic art history in Britain: its [[dialectical]] dynamic between market and institution contributed to the creation of an original and multifaceted publication.&lt;ref&gt;B. Pezzini, 'An open resource for scholars and a primary source for research: the Burlington Magazine online index', ''Art Libraries Journal'',36, no. 3, (June 2011), pp.46–51&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Burlington Magazine'' was founded as a journal of ancient art but already in its first decade, especially under the editorship of Fry articles on modern art became prominent. Topics covered in detail were: [[Paul Cézanne]] and [[Post-Impressionism]] in a debate between Fry and [[Dugald Sutherland MacColl|D. S. MacColl]],&lt;ref&gt;R. Shiff: ''Cézanne and the End of Impressionism'', Chicago, 1984, pp. 143–152&lt;/ref&gt; a debate on a bust of Flora ascribed to [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and later discovered to be a forgery, and the role of archival research in the art historical reconstruction, with contributions by [[Herbert Horne]] and Constance Jocelyn Ffoulkes.

''The Burlington Magazine'', especially in its first decades, was also preoccupied with the definition and development of [[formal analysis]] and [[connoisseurship]] in the visual arts and consistently observed, reviewed and contributed to the body of attributions to various artists, notably [[Rembrandt]], [[Poussin]], and [[Caravaggio]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Nicolson, 'The Burlington Magazine', ''Connoisseur'', 191 (March 1976), pp. 180–183&lt;/ref&gt; The journal had also many notable contributions by visual artists on other artists, notably [[Walter Sickert]] on [[Edgar Degas]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Sickert, 'Degas', ''The Burlington Magazine'', 31 (November 1917), pp. 193–191&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The journal is published monthly, and features a cross-section of writers.

The first issues of ''The Burlington Magazine'' were printed on high-quality paper, had a typeface designed by Herbert Horne and were richly illustrated with black and white photographs, many by the arts and crafts photographer [[Emery Walker]].

'''The Old Malthouse School''' (The '''OMH''') was a [[Preparatory School (UK)|preparatory school]] in the [[village]] of [[Langton Matravers]] near [[Swanage]] in the [[Isle of Purbeck]], [[Dorset]], [[United Kingdom]].

The school was founded in 1906 by Rex Corbett, an ex-England [[Football(soccer)|football]] player, and started with ten pupils in a building that was formerly a [[brewery]]. Tom Pellatt, his [[brother-in-law]] who ran [[Durnford School]] at Durnford Court in the same village had blasted out a swimming bath in the rocks at [[Dancing Ledge]], a mile and a half away on the coast and the pupils of both schools used this daily in the [[summer term]]. Durnford's most famous former pupil is [[Ian Fleming]], author of the [[James Bond]] novels and ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (novel)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]''.

In 1939, the [[school]] was sold by Corbett to Victor Haggard (H) and Evan Hope-Gill (Hopper) who inherited 37 boys. Durnford was requisitioned by the army later that year and the Durnford boys transferred to the Old Malthouse. Durnford was acquired by the owners of the Old Malthouse when the army gave it up in 1948. The main buildings were variously pulled down or sold, leaving the OMH with the grounds, which were levelled for playing fields. A third joint headmaster Peter Mattinson (Mr Matt) joined after [[World War II]] and the [[triumvirate]] ruled until 1974 when the school, then with about 80 boys, was sold to a Trust under the headmastership of Quintin Ambler. Ill-health led to Mr Ambler's early departure to be replaced as headmaster by Patrick Jordan in 1975 who expanded the school by adding a pre-prep department in the early 1980s. In 1988, Jon Phillips took over as [[Headmaster]], remaining for 15 years. During this time the school  became fully [[co-educational]]. Richard Keeble became [[Headmaster]] in January 2004 and left the school in July 2006 handing over the reins to longtime deputy Dr Moira Laffey. Through the 1970s and early 80s the school expanded to about 100 pupils but declining enrollment and increasing losses led to the decision to close the school in 2007. 

In April 2007, the local press reported that the school would close at the end of the 2007 summer term

A '''thermal blanket''' is a device used in thermal desorption to clean soil contamination. The primary function of a thermal blanket is to heat the soil to the boiling point of the contaminants (usually 100 to 325&amp;nbsp;°C and as high as 900 °C&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contaminants in the Subsurface: Source Zone Assessment and Remediation|last=National Research council|first=|publisher=The National Academies Press|year=2004|isbn=0309546648|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;) so that they break down. A vacuum pulls the resulting gas (along with volatilized contaminants) into a separate air cleaner that may use various methods, such as carbon filters and high-heat ovens, to completely destroy the contaminants. Aside from evaporation and volatilization, the contaminants may also be removed from the soil through other mechanisms such as [[steam distillation]], [[pyrolysis]], [[Redox|oxidation]], and other [[Chemical reaction|chemical reactions]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wiley's Remediation Technologies Handbook: Major Contaminant Chemicals and Chemical Groups|last=Lehr|first=Jay|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2004|isbn=978-0471455998 |doi=10.1002/0471655473 |location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=1042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their placement, the thermal blanket can only be used in shallow areas, which is around 1 meter. The process can take more than 24 hours to treat 6 inches of soil and up to 4 days for contaminated areas with depths of 12 to 18 inches.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Analysis of selected enhancements for soil vapor extraction|last=United States Environmental Protection Agency|first=|publisher=DIANE Publishing|year=1997|isbn=9781428903609|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=7-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deep contamination (contamination at depths greater than 1 meter) is handled using a similar method but with a deep penetrating heat source.  This is commonly referred to as an [[in situ thermal desorption]] (ISTD) thermal well and it uses heater elements that consist of nichrome wires in a ceramic insulator. Like the thermal blankets, the heating temperature could reach as high as 900 °C, heating adjacent regions through heat conduction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Vacuum is also applied to withdraw broken contaminants.

==Concerns==
It is reported that the application of the thermal blanket is limited&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and this could be attributed to a number of concerns. For example, as a contaminant becomes heated, it may leak outside of the area of the thermal blanket.  Therefore, the blanket must completely cover the contaminated area and have a strong enough vacuum to prohibit the spread of contamination. Incomplete destruction of contaminants may also lead to the introduction of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] and [[furans]] into the air.

The thermal blanket method has not been effectively tested on organic contaminants. The technology is presently commercially available. [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] Technology Ventures, Inc., for instance, has developed its own ISTD thermal blanket solution that can treat or remove contaminants on near-surface soil or pavements without excavation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''U Thong Style''' is one of the definitive styles for [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] icons which developed in Thailand (Siam) in the southern capital of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]].&lt;ref name=britanica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/612189/U-Thong-style |title=U Thong style (Thai religious sculpture) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three distinct periods for the style, 12th to 13th century, 13th to 14th century and 13th to the 15th century, with some obvious overlap.

Features common to all three types include:
*Small band between the hairline and forehead
*Robe draped with a long flap from the left shoulder ending in a straight line
*Fingers of unequal length
*Hairstyle is small, somewhat-spiky curls
*Seated, with the legs folded
*Simple concave base

==History of the style==
To retain the greatest spiritual potency, Buddha icons in [[Thai temple art and architecture|Thai temples]] had to resemble as closely as possible an original prototype that tradition erroneously believed had been made during the lifetime of the Buddha. Of the three major efforts by Thai kings to establish an "authentic" canon for the icons, the [[Sukhothai style]] was the first, followed by the U Thong and the lion types.&lt;ref name=britanica/&gt;

The populace of Southern Thailand, which captured [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] in approximately 1350, was in the 14th century still largely [[Mon people|Mon]], and the fusion of styles resulted in the more solid, corporeal, and squared-off U Thong image. Although the resulting changes may be seen most readily in the shape of the head, now more square than oval, and the broader, more sober features, there is also an increased heaviness of the body, no longer weightless but firmly seated on the ground.

While the Sukhothai style is characterized by linear emphasis, the U Thong style again shows concern for solidity and modeling. At the same time, the U Thong images are rather [[stolid]] and lack the linear excitement and uniquely Thai character of Sukhothai art. U Thong style, like Sukhothai style, is still copied in Thailand.&lt;ref name=britanica/&gt;

'''World Charter for Nature''' was adopted by [[United Nations]] member nation-states on October 28, 1982. It proclaims five "principles of conservation by which all human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged."

# Nature shall be respected and its essential processes shall not be impaired. 
# The genetic viability on the earth shall not be compromised; the population levels of all life forms, wild and domesticated, must be at least sufficient for their survival, and to this end necessary habitats shall be safeguarded.
# All areas of the earth, both land and sea, shall be subject to these principles of conservation; special protection shall be given to unique areas, to representative samples of all the different types of ecosystems and to the habitats of rare or endangered species.
# Ecosystems and organisms, as well as the land, marine and atmospheric resources that are utilized by man, shall be managed to achieve and maintain optimum sustainable productivity, but not in such a way as to endanger the integrity of those other ecosystems or species with which they coexist. 
# Nature shall be secured against degradation caused by warfare or other hostile activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Charter for Nature|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r007.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 August 2013|author=United Nations General Assembly|date=28 October 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vote was 111 for, one against ([[United States]]), 18 abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = International Environmental Standards Handbook | author = Scott S. Olson | isbn = 1-56670-270-4 | year = 1999 | pages = 39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Åland Islands Peace Institute''' in [[Mariehamn]], [[Finland]], conducts projects and research into peace and conflict issues in a broadly defined sense from the vantage-point of [[Åland]] and the special status that Åland enjoys under [[international law]]. It focuses on autonomy in various forms, -minority-related issues, demilitarisation and conflict management. The Institute was founded in 1992 as an independent charitable foundation. 

==Governance &amp; networks==
The Institute is a member of several national and international networks of organisations working on closely related issues. The Steering Board makes decisions relating to the Institute’s overall remit, while the Research Council is responsible for the Institute’s research activities. The Åland Islands Peace Institute has consultative status with the [[UN Economic and Social Council]], ECOSOC.

==Research==
The Peace Institute’s researchers and guest researchers focus on three broad subject areas:
* Security
* Autonomy, including the “Åland Example”
* Minorities

The Institute regularly publishes books and reports in these areas. By arranging seminars and conferences and through a growing -library that is open to the public, the Institute serves as a meeting-point for Åland, the Nordic countries and the [[Baltic Sea]] region.

Autonomy and conflict management seminars are arranged with groups from conflict-ridden regions around the world.

==Educational activities==
The Åland Islands Peace Institute arranges courses and seminar series in Åland and internationally in the following areas:
* Conflict management and non-violence
* Global and regional security
* Democracy and human rights
* Autonomies
* Minorities
* Trafficking prevention

The Institute runs a project called Educating for Peace in Åland’s schools. The aim is to introduce knowledge and experience about conflict management, non-violence, tolerance and school mediation in local schools. The Peace Institute runs this project  in collaboration with the Åland Government and the schools.

==Co-operation with neighbouring regions==
The Åland Islands Peace Institute has built a well-functioning network of non-governmental organisations in [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]] and the [[Kaliningrad]] region (Russia).

This co-operation is based on the experiences gained and methods developed at the Nendre Centre for Women and Children in [[Vilnius, Lithuania]]. Nendre was established in 1998 by the Åland Islands Peace Institute and the Devyndarbe Women’s Club. Today the Centre offers social services to single mothers and their children. It provides support to the mothers, day care for small children and afternoon activities for schoolchildren. Nendre has become recognized as one of the leading organisations in the field of gender equality education and promotion in Lithuania.

Since 2005 Nendre has been sharing its experience with organisations in Belarus and Kaliningrad. The goal is to give marginalised groups the strength to manage their problems and take control of their own lives. Project initiatives include training, counselling and -development activities for women and children.

The Åland Islands Peace Institute has also helped to spread the “girls’ group” method in Lithuania. This method, originally developed in the Nordic countries and adapted to local conditions, helps to -strengthen young girls’ self-awareness and prevent trafficking. The method is now also being introduced in Belarus.

==Youth work and the “Youth in Action” EU Programme==
The Åland Islands Peace Institute participates in international youth work in the following areas:
* European Voluntary Service (EVS). The Institute sends out and receives volunteers.
* Youth exchange programmes.
* Seminars, courses and other activities aimed at promoting dialogue and know-ledge about the living conditions of other people.

==The Åland Conciliation Office==
The Åland Conciliation Office is run by the Åland Islands Peace Institute on behalf of the County Administration in Åland. The Conciliation Office offers conciliation in accordance with the Finnish Act on Conciliation in Criminal and Certain Civil Cases.

Conciliation is a free service. The idea is that the parties through meetings and discussions should be able to agree on an indemnification, e.g. monetary compensation or a work performance. A conciliation session brings together the parties to the breach or dispute and two voluntary, trained and impartial mediators.

==The Åland Islands==
Åland consists of around 6,500 islands, of which 80 are inhabited, and has a population of about 27,000 people. Åland is a self-governing, demilitarised and Swedish-speaking region of Finland. Demilitarisation means that no troops may be stationed in Åland and that no fortifications may be built in the territory. Åland is also neutralised, which means that it must be kept outside the theatre of war in case of conflict. The international regime governing Åland is based on an 1856 demilitarisation convention.
