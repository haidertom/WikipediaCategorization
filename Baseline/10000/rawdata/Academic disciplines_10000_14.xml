'''Anthropopathism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἄνθρωπος ''anthropos'', "human" and πάθος ''pathos'', "suffering") is the attribution of human [[emotion]]s, or the ascription of [[human]] [[feeling]]s or [[passions]] to a non-[[human being]], generally to a [[deity]].

By comparison, the term [[anthropomorphism]] originally referred to the attribution of human form to a non-human being, but in modern usage anthropomorphism has come to encompass both meanings.

==Religion==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
This is a technique prevalent in religious writings, where, for instance, [[human]] [[emotion]] is attributed to [[God]], where he would not normally experience emotion in this sense.
This technique is particularly notable in the book of [[Genesis (Hebrew Bible)|Genesis]], as an example of the theme of God as a [[personal god]]. Some Bible scholars, however, argue that human emotions ascribed to God are indicative of divine responses within the matrix of human history that are in fact analogous to human emotions though not univocal.

The field of bacterial phylodynamics has increased substantially due to the advancement of [[next-generation sequencing]] and the amount of data available.

== Methods ==

=== Novel hypothesis (study design) ===
Studies can be designed to observe intra-host or inter-host interactions.  Bacterial phylodynamic studies usually focus on inter-host interactions with samples from many different hosts in a specific geographical location or several different geographical locations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The most important part of a study design is how to organize the sampling strategy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For example, the number of sampled time points, the sampling interval, and the number of sequences per time point are crucial to phylodynamic analysis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[Sampling bias]] causes problems when looking at a diverse taxological samples.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  For example, sampling from a limited geographical location may impact effective population size.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biek|first=Roman|last2=Pybus|first2=Oliver G.|last3=Lloyd-Smith|first3=James O.|last4=Didelot|first4=Xavier|title=Measurably evolving pathogens in the genomic era|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534715000683|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=30|issue=6|pages=306–313|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2015.03.009|pmc=4457702|pmid=25887947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generating data ===

==== Experimental settings ====
Sequencing of the genome or genomic regions and what sequencing technique to use is an important experimental setting to phylodynamic analysis.  Whole genome sequencing is often performed on bacterial genomes, although depending on the design of the study, many different methods can be utilized for phylodynamic analysis.  Bacterial genomes are much larger and have a slower evolutionary rate then RNA viruses, limiting studies on the bacterial phylodynamics.  The advancement of sequencing technology has made bacterial phylodynamics possible but proper preparation of the whole bacterial genomes is mandatory.

===== Alignment =====
When a new dataset with samples for phylodynamic analysis are obtained, the sequences in the new data set are aligned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  A [[BLAST|BLAST search]] is frequently executed to find similar strains of the pathogen of interest. Sequences collected from BLAST for an alignment will need the proper information to be added to a data set, such as sample collection date and geographical location of the sample.  [[Multiple sequence alignment|Multiple sequence alignment algorithms]] (e.g., MUSCLE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edgar|first=Robert C.|date=2004-01-01|title=MUSCLE: multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=32|issue=5|pages=1792–1797|doi=10.1093/nar/gkh340|issn=1362-4962|pmc=390337|pmid=15034147}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MAFFT]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katoh|first=Kazutaka|last2=Misawa|first2=Kazuharu|last3=Kuma|first3=Kei-ichi|last4=Miyata|first4=Takashi|date=2002-07-15|title=MAFFT: a novel method for rapid multiple sequence alignment based on fast Fourier transform|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=30|issue=14|pages=3059–3066|issn=0305-1048|pmc=135756|pmid=12136088}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clustal|CLUSAL W]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larkin|first=M. A.|last2=Blackshields|first2=G.|last3=Brown|first3=N. P.|last4=Chenna|first4=R.|last5=McGettigan|first5=P. A.|last6=McWilliam|first6=H.|last7=Valentin|first7=F.|last8=Wallace|first8=I.

After the running a multiple sequence alignment algorithm, manual editing the alignment is highly recommended.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Multiple sequence alignment algorithms can leave a large amount of indels in the sequence alignment when the indels do not exist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Manually editing the indels in the data set will allow a more accurate phylogenetic tree.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===== Quality control =====
In order to have an accurate phylodynamic analysis, quality control methods must be performed.  This includes checking the samples in the data set for possible contamination, measuring phylogenetic signal of the sequences, and checking the sequences for possible signs of recombinant strains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Contamination of samples in the data set can be excluded with by various laboratory methods and by proper DNA/RNA extraction methods.  There are several way to check for phylogenetic signal in an alignment, such as likelihood mapping, transition/transversions versus divergence plots, and the Xia test for saturation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  If phylogenetic signal of an alignment is too low then a longer alignment or an alignment of another gene in the organism may be necessary to perform phylogenetic analysis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Typically substitution saturation is only in issue in data sets with viral sequences.  Most algorithms used for phylogenetic analysis do not take into recombination into account, which can alter the molecular clock and coalescent estimates of a multiple sequence alignment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Strains that show signs of recombination should either be excluded from the data set or analyzed on their own.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Data analysis ===

==== Evolutionary model ====

The best fitting [[Models of DNA evolution|nucleotide or amino acid substitution model]] for a [[multiple sequence alignment]] is the first step in phylodynamic analysis.  This can be accomplished with several different algorithms (e.g., IQTREE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Lam-Tung|last2=Schmidt|first2=Heiko A.|last3=von Haeseler|first3=Arndt|last4=Minh|first4=Bui Quang|date=2015-01-01|title=IQ-TREE: A Fast and Effective Stochastic Algorithm for Estimating Maximum-Likelihood Phylogenies|url=https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/32/1/268/2925592/IQ-TREE-A-Fast-and-Effective-Stochastic-Algorithm|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=32|issue=1|pages=268–274|doi=10.1093/molbev/msu300|issn=0737-4038|pmc=4271533|pmid=25371430}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEGA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Sudhir|last2=Stecher|first2=Glen|last3=Tamura|first3=Koichiro|date=2016-07-01|title=MEGA7: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis Version 7.0 for Bigger Datasets|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=33|issue=7|pages=1870–1874|doi=10.1093/molbev/msw054|issn=1537-1719|pmid=27004904}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==== Phylogeny inference ====

There are several different methods to infer phylogenies.  These include methods include tree building algorithms such as [[UPGMA]], [[neighbor joining]], [[maximum parsimony]], [[maximum likelihood]], and [[Bayesian analysis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Hypothesis testing ===

====  Assessing phylogenetic support ====

Testing the reliability of the tree after inferring its phylogeny, is a crucial step in the phylodynamic pipeline.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Methods to test the reliability of a tree include [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]], [[maximum likelihood estimation]], and [[Posterior probability|posterior probabilities]] in [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian analysis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Phylodynamics inference ====

Several methods are used to assess phylodynamic reliability of a data set.  These methods include estimating the data set's [[molecular clock]], demographic history, population structure, [[gene flow]], and selection analysis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Phylodynamic results of a data set can also influence better study designs in future experiments.

== Examples ==

=== Phylodynamics of cholera ===
[[Cholera]] is a diarrheal disease that is caused by the bacterium ''[[Vibrio cholerae]].''   ''[[Vibrio cholerae|V. cholerae]]'' has been a popular bacterium for phylodynamic analysis after the [[2010 Haiti cholera outbreak|2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti]].  The cholera outbreak happened right after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake in Haiti]], which caused critical infrastructure damage, leading to the conclusion that the outbreak was most likely due to the ''[[Vibrio cholerae|V. cholerae]]'' bacterium being introduced naturally to the waters in Haiti from the earthquake.  Soon after the earthquake, the [[United Nations|UN]] sent [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti|MINUSTAH]] troops from Nepal to Haiti.  Rumors started circulating about terrible conditions of the [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti|MINUSTAH]] camp, as well as people claiming that the [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti|MINUSTAH]] troops were deposing of their waste in the [[Artibonite River]], which is the major water source in the surrounding area.  Soon after the MINUSTAH troops arrival, the first cholera case was reported near the location of the [[United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti|MINUSTAH]] camp.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piarroux|first=Renaud|title=Understanding the Cholera Epidemic, Haiti|url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/7/11-0059_article|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|language=en-us|volume=17|issue=7|pages=1161–1168|doi=10.3201/eid1707.110059|pmc=3381400|pmid=21762567}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phylodynamic analysis was used to look into the source of the Haiti cholera outbreak.  Whole genome sequencing of ''[[Vibrio cholerae|V. cholerae]]'' revealed that there was one single point source of the cholera outbreak in Haiti and it was similar to O1 strains circulating in South Asia.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orata|first=Fabini D.|last2=Keim|first2=Paul S.|last3=Boucher|first3=Yan|date=2014-04-03|title=The 2010 Cholera Outbreak in Haiti: How Science Solved a Controversy|url=http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003967|journal=PLOS Pathogens|volume=10|issue=4|pages=e1003967|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003967|issn=1553-7374|pmc=3974815|pmid=24699938}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Before the MINUSTAH troops from Nepal were sent to Haiti, a cholera outbreak had just occurred in Nepal.  In the original research to trace the origin of the outbreak, the Nepal strains were not available.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;   Phylodynamic analyses were performed on the Haitian strain and the Nepalese strain when it became available and affirmed that the Haitian cholera strain was the most similar to the Nepalese cholera strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Lee S.|last2=Petkau|first2=Aaron|last3=Beaulaurier|first3=John|last4=Tyler|first4=Shaun|last5=Antonova|first5=Elena S.|last6=Turnsek|first6=Maryann A.|last7=Guo|first7=Yan|last8=Wang|first8=Susana|last9=Paxinos|first9=Ellen E.|date=2013-08-30|title=Evolutionary Dynamics of Vibrio cholerae O1 following a Single-Source Introduction to Haiti|url=http://mbio.asm.org/content/4/4/e00398-13|journal=mBio|language=en|volume=4|issue=4|pages=e00398–13|doi=10.1128/mBio.00398-13|issn=2150-7511|pmc=3705451|pmid=23820394}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This outbreak strain of cholera in Haiti showed signs of an altered or hybrid strain of ''[[Vibrio cholerae|V. cholerae]]'' associated with high virulence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Typically high quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (hqSNP) from whole genome ''[[Vibrio cholerae|V. cholerae]]'' sequences are used for phylodynamic analysis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Using phylodynamic analysis to study cholera helps prediction and understanding of ''V. cholerae'' evolution during bacterial epidemics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5225">'''Biblical grammarians''' were linguists whose understanding of the [[Bible]] at least partially related to the science of [[Hebrew language]]. [[Tannaitic]] and Ammoraic [[exegesis]] rarely toiled in [[grammatical]] problems; grammar was a borrowed science from the [[Arab world]] in the [[medieval period]]. Despite its foreign influence, however, [[Hebrew grammar]] was a strongly [[Jewish]] product and developed independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Encyclopedia|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6854-grammar-hebrew#anchor4|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have continued to study grammar throughout the ages, until the present. Those mentioned in this article are a few of the most eminent grammarians.

== Early influences ==
=== Masoretes ===
The [[Masoretes]], who solidified the [[Masoretic Text]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]], vocalized and punctuated the biblical text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64496/biblical-literature|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Most of the work of the Masoretes is generally anonymous, though we know several names of Masoretes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Masorah"|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;   While their work essentially focused on establishing the correct text and not the principles of grammar, the Masoretes contributed to the future study of biblical language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Encyclopedia| url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6854-grammar-hebrew#anchor4|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many future grammarians continued the efforts of the Masorah and gave it a “central place in their works.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Masorah"|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medieval grammarians ==
=== Saadia Ga’on ===
Saadia Ga’on dealt with [[inflections]] and roots in his grammatical work. These contributions laid essential foundations for future grammarians. He also wrote about exceptions. His contemporary, [[Menahem ben Saruk]], elaborated upon the study of roots, and was also the first grammarian to write in Hebrew. A pupil of Saadia’s, [[Dunash ben Labrat]], criticized both [[Menahem]] and Saadia’s works but made many important contributions to understanding roots. Defenses of both sides by scholars such as Rabben Tam and ibn Ezra continued for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Encyclopedia| url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6854-grammar-hebrew#anchor4|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rashi ===
[[Rashi]]'s commentary attempted to explain the simple meaning of the biblical text. In many places in his commentary, Rashi explains a linguistic or grammatical rule, providing several examples of other places in which that rule applies. Many of his principles he derives from the work of Menahem and Dunash. Evidence shows that Rashi understood the difference between [[biblical Hebrew]] and [[rabbinic Hebrew]]. Rashi also utilized [[Old French]] to explain the meaning of words that could not be otherwise explained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. "Rashi"|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abraham ibn Ezra ===
In his introduction to the [[Pentateuch]], [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]] writes that his commentary is “bound by the cords of grammar.” The way to appreciating the text is to understand the simple meaning, and he opposed explanations of the text that do not explain the original intent. Generally, he limited applying predecessors’ laws to understanding the text and avoided outlandish explanations of exceptions. A specific opposition ibn Ezra had was to the explanation of “plene versus defective spelling.” The Spanish commentator also wrote several grammatical works outside his biblical commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v.

=== Joseph Kimhi ===
[[Joseph Kimhi]] of the 12th century composed Sefer Zikkaron, introducing a new understanding of vowels. His two sons, Moses and David, also were grammarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Encyclopedia| url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/6854-grammar-hebrew#anchor4|accessdate=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kimhis were exegets who relied most on [[peshat]] and avoided homileteical interpretations, and especially for David, [[philology]] played a large role in that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v.

== Modern grammarians ==
=== The ''maskilim'' ===
The ''maskilim'' abandoned the use of rabbinic Hebrew and returned to biblical Hebrew. They felt serious grammar was of major import for modernization. [[Naphtali Herz Wessely]] and Judah Leib Ben Ze’ev were major perpetrators of this movement of Hebrew, which may have led to modern Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v.

These minerals often form structural features such as sea [[animal shell|shells]] and the [[bone]] in [[mammals]] and [[birds]]. [[Organism]]s have been producing mineralised [[skeleton]]s for the past 550 million years. Other examples include [[copper]], [[iron]] and [[gold]] deposits involving bacteria.

==Biological roles==
Among [[metazoan]]s, biominerals composed of [[calcium carbonate]], [[calcium phosphate]] or [[silica]] perform a variety of roles such as support, defense and feeding.&lt;ref name=Livingston2006&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.07.047| pmid = 16987510| year = 2006| last1 = Livingston | first1 = B.| last2 = Killian | first2 = C.| last3 = Wilt | first3 = F.| last4 = Cameron | first4 = A.| last5 = Landrum | first5 = M.| last6 = Ermolaeva | first6 = O.| last7 = Sapojnikov | first7 = V.| last8 = Maglott | first8 = D.| last9 = Buchanan | first9 = A.| last10 = Ettensohn | first10 = C.

One hypothesis is that cells create them to avoid entombment by their own metabolic byproducts. Iron oxide particles may also enhance their metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fortin|first1=D.|title=Enhanced: What Biogenic Minerals Tell Us|journal=Science|date=12 March 2004|volume=303|issue=5664|pages=1618–1619|doi=10.1126/science.1095177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
If present on a super-cellular scale, biominerals are usually deposited by a dedicated organ, which is often defined very early in the embryological development.  This organ will contain an organic matrix that facilitates and directs the deposition of crystals.&lt;ref name=Livingston2006/&gt;  The matrix may be collagen, as in deuterostomes,&lt;ref name=Livingston2006/&gt; or based on chitin or other polysaccharides, as in molluscs.&lt;ref name='Checa2009'&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s00114-008-0461-1| pmid = 18843476| year = 2009| last1 = Checa | first1 = A.| last2 = Ramírez-Rico | first2 = J.| last3 = González-Segura | first3 = A.| last4 = Sánchez-Navas | first4 = A.| title = Nacre and false nacre (foliated aragonite) in extant monoplacophorans (=Tryblidiida: Mollusca)| volume = 96| issue = 1| pages = 111–122| journal = Die Naturwissenschaften|bibcode = 2009NW.....96..111C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shell formation in molluscs===
{{further|Mollusc shell}}
[[File:Shells-IZE-006-Black.jpg|thumb|Variety of mollusc shells (gastropods, snails and seashells).]]
The mollusc shell is a biogenic composite material that has been the subject of much interest in materials science because of its unusual properties and its model character for biomineralization. Molluscan shells consist of 95–99% calcium carbonate by weight, while an organic component makes up the remaining 1–5%. The resulting composite has a fracture toughness ~3000 times greater than that of the crystals themselves.&lt;ref name="Currey1999"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the biomineralization of the mollusc shell, specialized proteins are responsible for directing crystal nucleation, phase, morphology, and growths dynamics and ultimately give the shell its remarkable mechanical strength. The application of biomimetic principles elucidated from mollusc shell assembly and structure may help in fabricating new composite materials with enhanced optical, electronic, or structural properties.

=== Mineral production and degradation in fungi ===
[[Fungus|Fungi]] are a diverse group of organisms that belong to the [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] domain. Studies of their significant roles in geological processes, "geomycology", has shown that fungi are involved with biomineralization, [[biodegradation]], and metal-fungal interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gadd|first=Geoffrey M.|date=2007-01-01|title=Geomycology: biogeochemical transformations of rocks, minerals, metals and radionuclides by fungi, bioweathering and bioremediation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953756206003364|journal=Mycological Research|volume=111|issue=1|pages=3–49|doi=10.1016/j.mycres.2006.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying fungi's roles in biomineralization, it has been found that fungi deposit minerals with the help of an organic matrix, such as a protein, that provides a nucleation site for the growth of biominerals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Qianwei|last2=Gadd|first2=Geoffrey Michael|date=2017-08-10|title=Biosynthesis of copper carbonate nanoparticles by ureolytic fungi|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|doi=10.1007/s00253-017-8451-x|issn=1432-0614|pmc=5594056|pmid=28799032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungal growth may produce a copper-containing mineral precipitate, such as [[Basic copper carbonate|copper carbonate]] produced from a mixture of [[Ammonium carbonate|(NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Copper(II) chloride|CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The production of the copper carbonate is produced in the presence of proteins made and secreted by the fungi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These fungal proteins that are found extracellularly aid in the size and morphology of the [[carbonate minerals]] precipitated by the fungi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to precipitating carbonate minerals, fungi can also precipitate [[uranium]]-containing phosphate biominerals in the presence of organic [[phosphorus]] that acts a substrate for the process.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liang|first=Xinjin|last2=Hillier|first2=Stephen|last3=Pendlowski|first3=Helen|last4=Gray|first4=Nia|last5=Ceci|first5=Andrea|last6=Gadd|first6=Geoffrey Michael|date=2015-06-01|title=Uranium phosphate biomineralization by fungi|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.12771/abstract|journal=Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=17|issue=6|pages=2064–2075|doi=10.1111/1462-2920.12771|issn=1462-2920}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fungi produce a hyphal matrix, also known as [[mycelium]], that localizes and accumulates the uranium minerals that have been precipitated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although uranium is often deemed as toxic towards living organisms, certain fungi such as ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' and ''Paecilomyces javanicus'' can tolerate it.

Though minerals can be produced by fungi, they can also be degraded; mainly by [[Oxalic acid|oxalic-acid]] producing strains of fungi.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Oxalic acid production is increased in the presence of [[glucose]] for three organic acid producing fungi – ''Aspergillus niger'', ''[[Serpula himantioides]]'', and ''[[Trametes versicolor]]''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These fungi have been found to corrode [[apatite]] and [[galena]] minerals.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adeyemi|first=Ademola O.|last2=Gadd|first2=Geoffrey M.|date=2005-06-01|title=Fungal degradation of calcium-, lead- and silicon-bearing minerals|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10534-005-1539-2|journal=Biometals|language=en|volume=18|issue=3|pages=269–281|doi=10.1007/s10534-005-1539-2|issn=0966-0844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degradation of minerals by fungi is carried out through a process known as neogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adamo|first=Paola|last2=Violante|first2=Pietro|date=2000-05-01|title=Weathering of rocks and neogenesis of minerals associated with lichen activity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169131799000563|journal=Applied Clay Science|volume=16|issue=5|pages=229–256|doi=10.1016/S0169-1317(99)00056-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order of most to least oxalic acid secreted by the fungi studied are ''Aspergillus niger'', followed by ''Serpula himantioides'', and finally ''Trametes versicolor''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These capabilities of certain groups of fungi have a major impact on [[corrosion]], a costly problem for many industries and the economy.

Far from being a rare trait that evolved a few times and remained stagnant, biomineralization pathways in fact evolved many times and are still evolving rapidly today; even within a single genus it is possible to detect great variation within a single gene family.&lt;ref name=Jackson2010/&gt;

The [[homology (biology)|homology]] of biomineralization pathways is underlined by a remarkable experiment whereby the [[nacreous]] layer of a molluscan shell was implanted into a [[human tooth]], and rather than experiencing an immune response, the molluscan nacre was incorporated into the host bone matrix.  This points to the [[exaptation]] of an original biomineralization pathway.

The most ancient example of biomineralization, dating back 2 billion years, is the deposition of [[magnetite]], which is observed in some bacteria, as well as the teeth of [[chiton]]s and the brains of vertebrates; it is possible that this pathway, which performed a [[magnetosensory]] role in the common ancestor of all [[bilaterians]], was duplicated and modified in the Cambrian to form the basis for calcium-based biomineralization pathways.&lt;ref name=Kirschvink2000&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Kirschvink J.L.  |author2=Hagadorn, J.W. |lastauthoramp=yes |chapter= 10 A Grand Unified theory of Biomineralization. |editor=Bäuerlein, E. |title=The Biomineralisation of Nano- and Micro-Structures, |publisher=[[Wiley-VCH]] |location=Weinheim, Germany|pages=139–150|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iron is stored in close proximity to magnetite-coated chiton teeth, so that the teeth can be renewed as they wear.

==Astrobiology==
It has been suggested that biominerals could be important indicators of extraterrestrial life and thus could play an important role in the search for past or present life on [[Mars]].  Furthermore, [[Organic compounds (minerals)|organic components]] ([[biosignature]]s) that are often associated with biominerals are believed to play crucial roles in both pre-biotic and [[Biotic material|biotic]] reactions.&lt;ref name=SSG &gt;{{Cite book | editor2-first=David| editor2-last= Beaty | contribution=Final report of the MEPAG Astrobiology Field Laboratory Science Steering Group (AFL-SSG)| title=The Astrobiology Field Laboratory | editor1-first=Andrew |  editor1-last=Steele | publisher=[[Mars Exploration Program Analysis Group]] (MEPAG) - NASA| place=U.S.A.| pages=72| date=September 26, 2006| id= | contribution-url=http://mepag.jpl.nasa.gov/reports/AFL_SSG_WHITE_PAPER_v3.doc| chapter-format=.doc| accessdate=2009-07-22 |authors=MEPAG Astrobiology Field Laboratory Science Steering Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential applications==
Most traditional approaches to synthesis of nanoscale materials are energy inefficient, requiring stringent conditions (e.g., high temperature, pressure or pH) and often produce toxic byproducts. Furthermore, the quantities produced are small, and the resultant material is usually irreproducible because of the difficulties in controlling agglomeration.&lt;ref name="isbn1-55899-181-6"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Thomas, George Brinton |author2=Komarneni, Sridhar |author3=Parker, John |title=Nanophase and Nanocomposite Materials: Symposium Held December 1–3, 1992, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A. (Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings) |publisher=Materials Research Society |location=Pittsburgh, Pa |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=1-55899-181-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, materials produced by organisms have properties that usually surpass those of analogous synthetically manufactured materials with similar phase composition. Biological materials are assembled in aqueous environments under mild conditions by using macromolecules. Organic macromolecules collect and transport raw materials and assemble these substrates and into short- and long-range ordered composites with consistency and uniformity.
The aim of [[biomimetics]] is to mimic the natural way of producing minerals such as [[apatite]]s. Many man-made crystals require elevated temperatures and strong chemical solutions, whereas the organisms have long been able to lay down elaborate mineral structures at ambient temperatures. Often, the mineral phases are not pure but are made as [[Composite material|composites]] that entail an organic part, often [[protein]], which takes part in and controls the biomineralisation. These composites are often not only as hard as the pure mineral but also tougher, as the micro-environment controls biomineralisation.

===Uranium contaminants in groundwater===
[[File:Autunite-69257.jpg|thumb|Autunite crystal.]]
Biomineralization may be used to remediate groundwater contaminated with [[uranium]].&lt;ref name=Newsome2014&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254113004907|author1=Newsome, L. |author2=Morris, K. |author3=Lloyd, J. R.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=The biogeochemistry and bioremediation of uranium and other priority radionuclides|journal=Chemical Geology|year=2014|volume=363|pages=164–184|doi=10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.10.034|bibcode=2014ChGeo.363..164N}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biomineralization of uranium primarily involves the precipitation of uranium phosphate minerals associated with the release of phosphate by microorganisms. Negatively charged [[ligands]] at the surface of the cells attract the positively charged uranyl ion (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;). If the concentrations of phosphate and UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; are sufficiently high, minerals such as [[autunite]] (Ca(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;•10-12H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) or polycrystalline HUO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; may form thus reducing the mobility of UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.  Compared to the direct addition of inorganic phosphate to contaminated groundwater, biomineralization has the advantage that the ligands produced by microbes will target uranium compounds more specifically rather than react actively with all aqueous metals. Stimulating bacterial phosphatase activity to liberate phosphate under controlled conditions limits the rate of bacterial hydrolysis of organophosphate and the release of phosphate to the system, thus avoiding clogging of the injection location with metal phosphate minerals.&lt;ref name=Newsome2014/&gt; The high concentration of ligands near the cell surface also provides nucleation foci for precipitation, which leads to higher efficiency than chemical precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lloyd, J.

'''Cause''', also known as '''etiology''' ({{IPAc-en|iː|t|i|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}) and '''aetiology''', is the [[Causality|reason]] or origination of something.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenneth J. |last=Rothman |authorlink=Kenneth Rothman (epidemiologist) |first2=Sander |last2=Greenland |authorlink2=Sander Greenland |first3=Charles |last3=Poole |first4=Timothy L. |last4=Lash |chapter=Causation and Causal Inference |title=Modern Epidemiology |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |edition=Third |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7817-5564-1 |pages=6–7 |chapterurl=https://books.google.de/books?id=Z3vjT9ALxHUC&amp;pg=PA6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αἰτιολογία}}, ''aitiologia'', "giving a reason for" ({{lang|grc|αἰτία}}, ''aitia'', "cause"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Aetiology | work = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = 2nd | year = 2002 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-521942-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In medicine, the term refers to the causes of [[disease]]s or [[pathology|pathologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Greene J | url = http://www.widesmiles.org/cleftlinks/WS-364.html | title = The three C's of etiology | work = Wide Smiles | year = 1996 | accessdate = 2007-08-20 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070630061038/http://www.widesmiles.org/cleftlinks/WS-364.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-30}} Discusses several examples of the medical usage of the term ''etiology'' in the context of [[cleft lip]]s and explains methods used to study causation.&lt;/ref&gt; Where no etiology can be ascertained, the disorder is said to be [[idiopathic]].
Traditional accounts of the causes of disease may point to the "[[evil eye]]".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] scholar [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] put forward early ideas about [[microorganism]]s in a 1st-century BC book titled ''On Agriculture''.&lt;ref&gt;''Varro On Agriculture'' 1, xii Loeb&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval thinking on the etiology of disease showed the influence of [[Galen]] and of [[Hippocrates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/83/979/352 Maimonides: an early but accurate view on the treatment of hemorrhoids -- Magrill and Sekaran 83 (979): 352 -- Postgraduate Medical Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval [[Europe]]an doctors generally held the view that disease was related to the air and adopted a [[Miasma theory of disease|miasmatic approach]] to disease etiology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/index/w44720475g378602.pdf Case study: the history and ethics clean air]&lt;/ref&gt;

Etiological discovery in medicine has a history in [[Robert Koch]]'s demonstration that the tubercle bacillus (''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' complex) causes the disease [[tuberculosis]], ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' causes [[anthrax]], and ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' causes [[cholera]].  This line of thinking and evidence is summarized in [[Koch's postulates]]. But proof of causation in infectious diseases is limited to individual cases that provide experimental evidence of etiology.

In [[epidemiology]], several lines of evidence together are required to infer causation. [[Austin Bradford Hill|Sir Austin Bradford-Hill]] demonstrated a causal relationship between smoking and lung cancer, and summarized the line of reasoning in the epidemiological criteria for causation. Dr. Al Evans, a US epidemiologist, synthesized his predecessors' ideas in proposing the Unified Concept of Causation.

==Chain of causation and correlation==

Further thinking in epidemiology was required to [[correlation is not causation|distinguish causation from association or statistical correlation]]. Events may occur together simply due to [[Randomness|chance]], [[bias]] or [[confounding]], instead of one event being caused by the other. It is also important to know which event is the cause. Careful sampling and measurement are more important than sophisticated statistical analysis to determine causation. Experimental evidence involving interventions (providing or removing the supposed cause) gives the most compelling evidence of etiology.

Related to this, sometimes several symptoms always appear together, or more often than what could be expected, though it is known that one cannot cause the other. These situations are called [[syndrome]]s, and normally it is assumed that an underlying condition must exist that explains all the symptoms.

Other times there is not a single cause for a disease, but instead a chain of causation from an initial trigger to the development of the clinical disease. An etiological agent of disease may require an independent co-factor, and be subject to a promoter (increases expression) to cause disease. An example of all the above, which was recognized late, is that [[peptic ulcer disease]] may be induced by stress, requires the presence of acid secretion in the stomach, and has primary etiology in ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' infection. Many chronic diseases of unknown cause may be studied in this framework to explain multiple epidemiological associations or [[risk factor]]s which may or may not be causally related, and to seek the actual etiology.{{r to section}}

==Etiological heterogeneity==

Some diseases, such as [[diabetes]] or [[hepatitis]], are syndromically defined by their signs and [[symptom]]s, but include different conditions with different etiologies. These are called [[heterogeneous condition]]s.

Conversely, a single etiology, such as [[Epstein-Barr virus]], may in different circumstances produce different diseases such as [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis]], [[nasopharyngeal carcinoma]], or [[Burkitt's lymphoma]].

===Endotype===
{{main|endotype}}
An '''endotype''' is a subtype of a condition, which is defined by a distinct functional or [[Pathobiology|pathobiological]] mechanism. This is distinct from a [[Phenotype (clinical medicine)|phenotype]], which is any observable characteristic or trait of a [[disease]], such as [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], development, biochemical or physiological properties, or behavior, without any implication of a mechanism. It is envisaged that [[patient]]s with a specific endotype present themselves within phenotypic clusters of diseases.

One example is asthma, which is considered to be a [[syndrome]], consisting of a series of endotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lötvall |first=J. |last2=Akdis |first2=C. A. |last3=Bacharier |first3=L. B. |last4=Bjermer |first4=L. |last5=Casale |first5=T. B. |last6=Custovic |first6=A. |last7=Lemanske |first7=R. F. Jr. |last8=Wardlaw |first8=A. J. |last9=Wenzel |first9=S. E. |last10=Greenberger |first10=P. A. |title=Asthma endotypes: A new approach to classification of disease entities within the asthma syndrome |journal=[[Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|J Allergy Clin Immunol]] |year=2011 |volume=127 |issue=2 |pages=355–60 |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2010.11.037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the concept of [[disease entity]].

Other example could be [[AIDS]], where an HIV infection can produce several [[clinical stage]]s. AIDS is defined as the clinical stage IV of the HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Kenneth G. |last=Castro |first2=John W. |last2=Ward |first3=Laurence |last3=Slutsker |first4=James W. |last4=Buehler |first5=Harold W. |last5=Jaffe |first6=Ruth L. |last6=Berkelman |title=1993 Revised Classification System for HIV Infection and Expanded Surveillance Case Definition for AIDS among Adolescents and Adults |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=17 |issue=4 |year=1993 |pages=802–810 |jstor=4457386 |doi=10.1093/clinids/17.4.802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10510">'''Cellular waste products''' are formed as a by-product of [[cellular respiration]], a series of processes and reactions that generate energy for the cell, in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. Two examples of cellular respiration creating cellular waste products are [[aerobic respiration]] and [[anaerobic respiration]].

Each pathway generates different waste products.

==Aerobic respiration==
{{main article|Aerobic respiration}}
When in the presence of oxygen, cells use aerobic respiration to obtain energy from [[glucose]] molecules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purchon.com/biology/aerobic.htm Aerobic Respiration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/C004535/aerobic_respiration.html Aerobic Respiration&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706222305/http://library.thinkquest.org/C004535/aerobic_respiration.html |date=July 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simplified Theoretical Reaction:''' C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6 (aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + 6O&lt;sub&gt;2 (g)&lt;/sub&gt; → 6CO&lt;sub&gt;2 (g)&lt;/sub&gt; + 6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt; (l)&lt;/sub&gt; + ~ 30ATP

Cells undergoing aerobic respiration produce 6 molecules of [[carbon dioxide]], 6 molecules of [[water]], and up to 30 molecules of ATP ([[adenosine triphosphate]]), which is directly used to produce energy, from each molecule of glucose in the presence of surplus oxygen.

In aerobic respiration, oxygen serves as the recipient of electrons from the [[electron transport chain]].  Aerobic respiration is thus very efficient because oxygen is a strong [[oxidant]]. 
Aerobic respiration proceeds in a series of steps, which also increases efficiency - since glucose is broken down gradually and ATP is produced as needed, less energy is wasted as heat.  This strategy results in the waste products H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; being formed in different amounts at different phases of respiration.  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is formed in [[Pyruvate decarboxylation]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is formed in [[oxidative phosphorylation]], and both are formed in the [[citric acid cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lodish|title=Molecular Cell Biology|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|isbn=978-1-4292-3413-9|pages=518–519|edition=7th |author2=Harvey F Lodish |author3=Arnold Berk |author4=Chris Kaiser |author5=Monty Krieger |author6=Anthony Bretscher |author7=Hidde L Ploegh |author8=Angelika Amon |author9=Matthew P Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The simple nature of the final products also indicates the efficiency of this method of respiration.  All of the energy stored in the carbon-carbon bonds of glucose is released, leaving CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  Although there is energy stored in the bonds of these molecules, this energy is not easily accessible by the cell.  All usable energy is efficiently extracted.

==Anaerobic respiration==
{{main article|Anaerobic Respiration}}

Anaerobic respiration is done by aerobic organisms when there is not sufficient oxygen in a cell to undergo aerobic respiration as well as by cells called [[anaerobes]] that selectively perform anaerobic respiration even in the presence of oxygen.  
In anaerobic respiration, weak oxidants like [[sulfate]] and [[nitrate]] serve as oxidants in the place of oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lodish|title=Molecular Cell Biology|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|isbn=978-1-4292-3413-9|pages=520–523|edition=7th |author2=Harvey F Lodish |author3=Arnold Berk |author4=Chris Kaiser |author5=Monty Krieger |author6=Anthony Bretscher |author7=Hidde L Ploegh |author8=Angelika Amon |author9=Matthew P Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, in anaerobic respiration sugars are broken down into carbon dioxide and other waste products that are dictated by the oxidant the cell uses.  Whereas in aerobic respiration the oxidant is always oxygen, in anaerobic respiration it varies.  Each oxidant produces a different waste product, such as nitrite, succinate, sulfide, methane, and acetate. 
Anaerobic respiration is correspondingly less efficient than aerobic respiration.  In the absence of oxygen, not all of the carbon-carbon bonds in glucose can be broken to release energy.  A great deal of extractable energy is left in the waste products. 
Anaerobic respiration generally occurs in prokaryotes in environments that do not contain oxygen.

==Fermentation==
{{main article|Fermentation (biochemistry)}}

Fermentation is another process by which cells can extract energy from glucose.  It is not a form of cellular respiration, but it does generate ATP, break down glucose, and produce waste products.  
Fermentation, like aerobic respiration, begins by breaking glucose into two [[pyruvate]] molecules.  From here, it proceeds using [[endogenous]] organic electron receptors, whereas cellular respiration uses [[exogenous]] receptors, such as oxygen in aerobic respiration and nitrate in anaerobic respiration.  These varied organic receptors each generate different waste products. 
Common products are lactic acid, lactose, hydrogen, and ethanol.  Carbon dioxide is also commonly produced.&lt;ref&gt;Voet, Donald &amp; Voet, Judith G. (1995). Biochemistry (2nd ed.). New York, NY: John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-471-58651-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Fermentation occurs primarily in anaerobic conditions, although some organisms such as yeast use fermentation even when oxygen is plentiful.

===Lactic Acid Fermentation===
{{main article|Lactic acid fermentation}}

'''Simplified Theoretical Reaction:''' C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; 2C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 ATP (120 kJ)&lt;ref&gt;[[Lactic acid fermentation#cite ref-campbell 3-1]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Lactic Acid Fermentation is commonly known as the process by which mammalian muscle cells produce energy in anaerobic environments, as in instances of great physical exertion, and is the simplest type of fermentation.  It starts along the same pathway as aerobic respiration, but once glucose is converted to [[pyruvate]] proceeds down one of two pathways and produces only two molecules of ATP from each molecule of glucose. In the homolactic pathway, it produces [[lactic acid]] as waste.  In the heterolactic pathway, it produces lactic acid as well as [[ethanol]] and carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Neil|title=Biology, 7th Edition|year=2005|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|isbn=0-8053-7146-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Lactic acid fermentation is relatively inefficient.  The waste products lactic acid and ethanol have not been fully oxidized and still contain energy, but it requires the addition of oxygen to extract this energy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fermentation (biochemistry)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, lactic acid fermentation occurs only when aerobic cells are lacking oxygen. However, some aerobic mammalian cells will preferentially use lactic acid fermentation over aerobic respiration.  This phenomenon is called the [[Warburg effect (oncology)|Warburg effect]] and is found primarily in cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;Warburg O (1956). "On the origin of cancer cells". Science 123 (3191): 309–314. Bibcode 1956Sci...123..309W. doi:10.1126/science.123.3191.309. {{PMID|13298683}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Muscles cells under great exertion will also use lactic acid fermentation to supplement aerobic respiration.  Lactic acid fermentation is somewhat faster, although less efficient, than aerobic respiration, so in activities like sprinting it can help quickly provide needed energy to muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roth|first=Stephen|title=Why does lactic acid build up in muscles? And why does it cause soreness?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-does-lactic-acid-buil|publisher=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secretion and effects of waste products==
Cellular respiration takes place in the [[cristae]] of the [[mitochondria]] within cells.  Depending on the pathways followed, the products are dealt with in different ways.

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is excreted from the cell via [[diffusion]] into the blood stream, where it is transported in three ways:
*Up to 7% is dissolved in its molecular form in blood plasma.
* About 70-80% is converted into hydrocarbonate ions,
* The remainder binds with [[hemoglobin]] in red blood cells, is carried to the lungs, and exhaled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKinley|first=Michael|title=Human Anatomy (3rd Ed)|year=2012|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-337809-1|pages=638–643, 748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O also diffuses out of the cell into the blood stream, from where it is excreted in the form of perspiration, water vapor in breath, or [[urine]] from the [[kidneys]]. Water, along with some dissolved solutes, are removed from blood circulation in the [[nephrons]] of the kidney and eventually excreted as urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McKinley|first=Michael|title=Human Anatomy (3rd Ed)|year=2012|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-337809-1|pages=818–830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The products of fermentation can be processed different ways, depending on the cellular conditions.

Lactic acid tends to accumulate in the muscles, which causes pain of the muscle and joint as well as fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sparknotes.com/biology/cellrespiration/glycolysis/section3.rhtml&lt;/ref&gt;   It also creates a gradient which induces water to flow out of cells and increases blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Covián, Fr. G. and Krogh, A. (1935), The changes in osmotic pressure and total concentration of the blood in man during and after muscular work. Skandinavisches Archiv für Physiologie, 71: 251–259. doi: 10.1111/j.1748-1716.1935.tb00401.x&lt;/ref&gt;  Research suggests that lactic acid may also play a role in lowering levels of [[potassium]] in the blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheema-Dhadli|first=S |author2=C.-K. Chong |author3=K.S. Kamel |author4=M.L. Halperin |title=An Acute Infusion of Lactic Acid Lowers the Concentration of Potassium in Arterial Plasma by Inducing a Shift of Potassium into Cells of the Liver in Fed Rats|journal=Nephron Physiology|year=2012|volume=120|issue=2|pages=7–15|doi=10.1159/000336321|url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?doi=336321|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be converted back to pyruvate or converted back to glucose in the liver and fully metabolized by aerobic respiration.&lt;ref&gt;McArdle, W.

The '''Center for International Forestry Research''' ('''CIFOR''') is a non-profit scientific research organization that conducts research on the use and management of [[forests]] with a focus on tropical forests in developing countries. CIFOR is the forestry research center of the [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] (CGIAR), a network of 15 research centers around the world that focus on agricultural research for sustainable development, working closely with governments and other partners to help develop evidence-based solutions to problems related to sustainable agriculture and natural resource management.  

CIFOR’s research contributes to the three CGIAR System-Level Outcomes: reduced poverty, improved food and nutrition security, and improved natural resource systems and [[ecosystem services]]. It also contributes to the new United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goals]] and commitments made by countries in the [[Paris Agreement|Paris agreement]] and other accords related to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]]. 

== Overview ==
[[Image:Heaquarters bogor.jpg|thumb|left|CIFOR's headquarters in [[Bogor, Indonesia]]]]
CIFOR's research and expert analysis help policy makers and practitioners shape policy, improve the management of tropical forests and address the needs of people who depend on [[forests]] for their livelihoods. CIFOR's multidisciplinary approach considers the underlying drivers of [[deforestation]] and degradation, which often lie outside the forestry sector: forces such as [[agriculture]], infrastructure development, trade and [[Investment policy|investment policies]], and law enforcement.

CIFOR has its headquarters in [[Bogor, Indonesia]]. The current Director General is Robert Nasi. It has three regional offices: in [[Burkina Faso]] (West Africa), [[Cameroon]] (Central Africa) and [[Kenya]] (East and South Africa). It has project offices in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Zambia]] (Africa), [[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]] (Asia), and [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]] (Latin America). CIFOR is one of 15 centers within the [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] (CGIAR).

In implementing its research, CIFOR collaborates with other centers within the CGIAR — the [[World Agroforestry Centre]], the [https://ciat.cgiar.org/ International Center for Tropical Agriculture] (CIAT) and [[Bioversity International]] — to conduct the CGIAR Consortium Research Programme ''Forests, Trees and Agroforestry'' (also known as CRP6). CRP6 objective is to enhance the management and use of forests, agroforestry and tree genetic resources across the landscape, from forests to farms.

== History ==
Although many link CIFOR’s creation to the 1992 [[Earth Summit]] because it came into existence the following year, the discussions that led to founding CIFOR predated the Earth Summit by several years. In 1991, the CGIAR appointed the [[Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research]] (ACIAR) as the implementing agency responsible for establishing CIFOR and setting up a Board of Trustees. CIFOR’s Establishment Agreement was signed by [[Australia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United States]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Establishment Agreement for the Center for International Forestry Research|url=https://www.ecolex.org/details/establishment-agreement-for-the-center-for-international-forestry-research-tre-001301/participants/?|website=www.ecolex.org|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Agreement was lodged with the [[United Nations]] and CIFOR's legal identity as an international organisation was consolidated with a Host Country Agreement between the new Board and the [[Government of Indonesia]] in May 1993.

Over time, CIFOR increased the focus of its research on forest policy rather than on technical forestry or [[tree breeding]], in order to complement the efforts of national and private-sector institutes. Instead of having laboratories, CIFOR would be a ‘center without walls’, marshaling interdisciplinary research teams in collaboration with partners to tackle forest policy changes.

== Partners ==

CIFOR works with government agencies and non-governmental organization in the countries where its scientists conduct research. Top partners include the CGIAR, European Union, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation ([[NORAD]]), Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ([[Australian Aid]]), US Agency for International Development ([[USAID]]), BMZ/[[BMUB]], Global Environment Facility ([[Global_Environment_Facility|GEF]]), International Fund for Agricultural Development ([[IFAD]]), [[Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs]], [[Austrian Development Agency]], British Department for International Development ([[DFID]]), [[French Global Environment Facility]], and [[Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation]].

== Strategy ==
CIFOR’s first strategy, set out in 1996, provided the foundations and direction for research that affected the understanding and practice of forest management throughout the tropics. But the world’s forests and the way they are perceived have changed dramatically since CIFOR was established.

Foremost among many changes is that forests are today centre-stage in the global debate on how to tackle climate change. Almost 20 per cent of global carbon emissions are caused by deforestation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kanninen, M |author2=Murdiyarso, D |author3=Seymour, F |author4=Angelsen, A |author5=Wunder, S  |author6=German, L|title=Do Trees Grow on Money? The implications of deforestation research for policies to promote REDD|journal=Infobrief|date=November 2008|issue=14|url=http://unfccc.int/files/methods_science/redd/application/pdf/do_trees_grow_on_money_infobrief.pdf|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so curbing forest loss is a way to reduce global warming. Also the promotion of biofuels by governments concerned about global warming is driving forest clearance in some areas.

To respond to these and other challenges, CIFOR devised a new strategy for a new era.&lt;ref name=strat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/Books/CIFORStrategy0801.pdf |title=CIFOR strategy 2010-2018 |publisher= CIFOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approved by the Board of Trustees in May 2008, the strategy will guide CIFOR’s work until 2018. 

== CGIAR Research Programme on Forests, Trees and Agroforestry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CIFOR Webmaster |url=http://foreststreesagroforestry.org/ |title=Home - Forests, Trees and Agroforestry |publisher=Cifor.org |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
CIFOR is the leading center for the CGIAR Research Programme 'Forests, Trees and Agroforestry' (also known as CRP6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forests, Trees and Agroforestry|url=http://www.cifor.org/crp6/|publisher=CIFOR|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative brings together four Centers who specialise in their respective subjects — the [[World Agroforestry Centre]] (ICRAF), CIFOR, the [[International Center for Tropical Agriculture]] (CIAT) and [[Bioversity International]]. The programme will convene expertise across the CGIAR system, and will partner with research and practitioner organisations around the world.
 
Within the consortium research program, the research focus is organised into five components with the clear objective of enhancing the management and use of forests, agroforestry and tree genetic resources across the landscape from forests to farms.

===Component 1: Smallholder production systems and markets===
[[File:Theme3-smallholder.jpg|thumb|CRP6 Component 1 focuses on the needs of smallholder producers]]

== Other major projects ==

=== Global Comparative Study on REDD+&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestsclimatechange.org/global-comparative-study-on-redd.html |title=Global Comparative Study on REDD |publisher=Forestsclimatechange.org |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Over four years, CIFOR and its partner organisations are undertaking a major global comparative study on the implementation of pilot REDD+ ([[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation]]) projects.

The aim of the study is to compare how pilot REDD+ projects are working at national and subnational levels, and share lessons learned from these comparisons for the benefit of everyone involved in designing and implementing REDD+ projects. Essentially, by providing policy makers and communities with this information, the project aims to ensure implementation of REDD+ is as effective, cost-efficient and equitable as possible — and ultimately reduces carbon emissions, deforestation and forest degradation across the world, while producing benefits like poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning from REDD: a global comparative study|url=http://www.cifor.org/nc/online-library/browse/view-publication/publication/2953.html|publisher=CIFOR|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2009/08/25/17491830/website.redd-i.diluncurkan|title=Website REDD-I Diluncurkan|newspaper=Kompas|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research for the global comparative study is being undertaken in 11 countries — Bolivia, Brazil, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Nepal, Peru, Tanzania and Vietnam.

===Poverty and Environment Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CIFOR|url=http://www.cifor.org/pen |title=Poverty Environment Network |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

The Poverty and Environment Network (PEN) is an international research project and network launched by CIFOR in September 2004 and completed in 2010. PEN still exists as a database containing survey data on more than 8,000 households in more than 40 study sites in 25 developing countries.

It was the largest and most comprehensive global analysis of tropical forests and poverty, and aimed to put a systematic framework of knowledge around the role tropical forests play in poverty alleviation. The project aimed to provide data on the ways that poor people depend on forest resources, in order to both inform mainstream forest policy design and to contribute to the design of policies and projects to alleviate poverty, and thereby contribute to meeting the Millennium Development Goal of 50% poverty reduction by 2015.

In order for the socioeconomic data to be uniform and therefore comparable across countries and project sites, research partners (mainly PhD students) from a number of universities and research institutes collected quarterly data at the household and village level using standardised definitions, questionnaires and methods. The study sites were chosen to obtain representative coverage of geographical regions, forest types, forest tenure regimes, levels of poverty, infrastructure and market access, and population density.

Preliminary results from the study’s global database showed that among those surveyed, forest income – on average – constituted more than one fifth of total household income, while environmental income (forest and non-forest) made up more than one fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New global study shows high reliance on forests among rural poor|url=http://www.forestcarbonportal.com/news/new-global-study-shows-high-reliance-forests-among-rural-poor|publisher=Forest Carbon Portal|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communicating research ==
According to past Director General Frances Seymour, CIFOR considers bridging the gap between research, policy and practice through effective communications is one of its challenges as a research organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message from the Director General|url=http://www.cifor.org/about-us/message-from-the-director-general.html|publisher=cifor.org|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization is committed to sharing its research and other information with others in the research community, and also with policymakers, indigenous and community groups, donor agencies, the media and the general public.

[[Image:Christaller's central place theory animation.gif|thumb|right]]
'''Central place theory''' is a [[geography|geographical]] [[theory]] that seeks to explain the number, size and location of [[human settlement]]s in a [[residential system]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Goodall, B. (1987) The Penguin Dictionary of Human Geography. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was created by the [[Germany|German]] geographer [[Walter Christaller]], who asserted that settlements simply functioned as 'central places' providing services to surrounding areas.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

==Building the Theory ==
To develop the theory, Christaller made the following simplifying assumptions:&lt;ref&gt;http://uprav.ff.cuni.cz/?q=system/files/christaller.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

All areas have:
* an unbounded [[isotropic]] (all flat), homogeneous, limitless surface ([[abstract space]])
* an evenly distributed population
* all settlements are equidistant and exist in a triangular lattice pattern
* evenly distributed resources
* distance decay mechanism
* perfect competition and all sellers are economic people maximizing their profits
* consumers are of the same income level and same shopping behaviour
* all [[consumer]]s have a similar purchasing power and demand for goods and services
* Consumers visit the nearest central places that provide the function which they demand. They minimize the distance to be travelled
* no provider of goods or services is able to earn excess profit (each supplier has a monopoly over a hinterland)
Therefore, the trade areas of these central places who provide a particular good or service must all be of equal size
* there is only one type of transport and this would be equally easy in all directions
* transport cost is proportional to distance traveled in example, the longer the distance traveled, the higher the transport cost()

The theory then relied on two concepts: ''threshold'' and ''range''. 
*[[Threshold population|Threshold]] is the minimum market (population or income) needed to bring about the selling of a particular good or service.
*Range is the maximum distance consumers are prepared to travel to acquire goods - at some point the cost or inconvenience will outweigh the need for the good.

The result of these consumer preferences is that a system of centers of various sizes will emerge. Each center will supply particular types of goods forming levels of hierarchy.  In the functional hierarchies, generalizations can be made regarding the spacing, size and function of settlements.

#The larger the settlements are in size, the fewer in number they will be, i.e. there are many small villages, but few large cities.
#The larger the settlements grow in size, the greater the distance between them, i.e. villages are usually found close together, while cities are spaced much further apart.
#As a settlement increases in size, the range and number of its functions will increase .
#As a settlement increases in size, the number of higher-order services will also increase, i.e. a greater degree of specialization occurs in the services.

The higher the order of the goods and services (more durable,Heidi valuable and variable), the larger the range of the goods and services, the longer the distance people are willing to travel to acquire them.

At the base of the hierarchy pyramid are shopping centres, newsagents etc. which sell low order goods. These centres are small. At the top of the pyramid are centres selling high order goods. These centres are large. Examples for low order goods and services are: newspaper stalls, groceries, bakeries and post offices. Examples for high order goods and services include jewelry, large shopping malls and arcades. They are supported by a much larger threshold population and demand.

==Predictions==
He deduced that settlements would tend to form in a triangular/hexagonal lattice, as it is the most efficient pattern to serve areas without any overlap.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

In the orderly arrangement of an urban hierarchy, seven different principal orders of settlement have been identified by Christaller, providing different groups of goods and services. Settlement are regularly spaced - equidistant spacing between same order centers, with larger centers farther apart than smaller centers. Settlements have hexagonal market areas, and are most efficient in number and functions.

The different layouts predicted by Christaller have ''K''-values which show how much the Sphere of Influence of the central places takes in &amp;mdash; the central place itself counts as 1 and each portion of a satellite counts as its portion:

=== ''K'' = 3 Marketing principle ===
[[Image:Christaller model 1.svg|thumb|right|100px|''K'' = 3 Principle]]
According to the marketing principle ''K'' = 3, the market area of a higher-order place(node) occupies 1/3rd of the market area of each of the consecutive lower size place(node) which lies on its neighbor; the lower size nodes (6 in numbers and 2nd larger circles) are located at the corner of a largest hexagon around low value the high-order settlement.  Each high-order settlement gets 1/3rd of each satellite settlement (which are 6 in total), thus ''K'' = 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;6&amp;times;1/3 = 3.

However, although in this ''K'' = 3 marketing network the distance traveled is minimized, the transport network is not the

=== ''K'' = 4 Transport/Traffic principle ===
[[Image:Christaller model2.jpg|thumb|right|100px|''K'' = 4 Principle]]
According to ''K'' = 4 transport principle, the market area of a higher-order place includes a half of the market area of each of the six neighbouring lower-order places, as they are located on the edges of hexagons around the high-order settlements. This generates a hierarchy of central places which results in the most efficient transport network. There are maximum central places possible located on the main transport routes connecting the higher order center.The transportation principle involves the minimization of the length of roads connecting central places at all hierarchy levels. In this system of nesting, the lower order centres are all located along the roads linking the higher order centres. This alignment of places along a road leads to minimization of road length. However, for each higher order centre, there are now four centres of immediate lower order,as opposed to three centres under the marketing principle.

=== ''K'' = 7 Administrative principle ===
[[Image:Christaller model 3.jpg|thumb|right|100px|''K'' = 7 Principle]]
According to ''K'' = 7 administrative principle (or political-social principle), settlements are nested according to sevens. The market areas of the smaller settlements are completely enclosed within the market area of the larger settlement.  Since tributary areas cannot be split administratively, they must be allocated exclusively to a single higher-order place. Efficient administration is the control principle in this hierarchy.

==Evaluation==

The validity of the place theory may vary with local factors, such as climate, topography, history of development, technological improvement and personal preference of consumers and suppliers. However, it is still possible to discern Christaller patterns in most distributions of urban centres, even though these patterns will often be distorted by the terrain or imperfect because of suboptimal (with regard to the optimal distribution of centres) historical development decisions.

Economic status of consumers in an area is also important. Consumers of higher economic status tend to be more mobile and therefore bypass centers providing only lower order goods. The application of central place theory must be tempered by an awareness of such factors when planning shopping center space location.

Purchasing power and density affect the spacing of centers and hierarchical arrangements. Sufficient densities will allow, for example, a grocery store, a lower order function, to survive in an isolated location.

Factors shaping the extent of market areas: 
*  [[Land use]]: industrial areas can provide little in the way of a consuming population
*  Poor [[accessibility]]: this can limit the extent of a center's market area
* [[Competition]]: this limits the extent of market areas in all directions
* [[Technology]]: high mobility afforded by the automobile allows overlapping of market areas

Market area studies provide another technique for using central place theory as a retail location planning tool. The hierarchy of shopping centers has been widely used within the planning of "[[new town]]s". In this new town, the hierarchy of business centers is evident. One main [[shopping center]] provides mostly [[Durable good|durable goods]] (higher order); district and local shopping centers supply, increasingly, convenience (lower order) goods. These centers provided for in the new town plan are not free from outside competition. The impacts of surrounding existing centers on the new town centers cannot be ignored.

==Examples==
The newly reclaimed [[polders]] of the [[Netherlands]] provide an isotropic plane on which settlements have developed and in certain areas 6 small towns can be seen surrounding a larger town, especially in the Noord-Oostpolder and Flevoland.
The [[The Fens|Fens]] of [[East Anglia]] in the UK also provide a large expanse of flat land with no natural barriers to settlement development.  [[Cambridge]] is a good example of a K=4 Transport Model Central Place, although it is surrounded by 7, rather than 6, settlements.  Each satellite is 10–15 miles from Cambridge and each lies on a major road leading out of Cambridge:
* [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] - A10 north
* [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] - A1303 (now bypassed by A14/A11) northeast
* [[Haverhill, Suffolk|Haverhill]] - A1307 southeast
* [[Saffron Walden]] - A1301 south
* [[Royston, Hertfordshire|Royston]] - A10 southwest
* [[St Neots]] - A428 west
* [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St Ives]] - A14 northwest

As all of the satellite settlements are on transport links, this is a good example of a K=4 CPT model (although in this case it is K=4.5 due to 7 rather than 6 settlements).

Another example of the use of CPT was in the delineation of Medical Care Regions in California.  A hierarchy of primary, secondary and tertiary care cities was described,
and the population size and income needed to support each medical care specialty in California determined.

== Criticism ==
The Central Place Theory has been criticized for being static; it does not incorporate the temporal aspect in the development of central places. Furthermore, the theory holds up well when it comes to agricultural areas, but not industrial or postindustrial areas due to their diversified nature of various services or their varied distribution of natural resources.

== Newer developments: a dynamic concept for CPT ==
Newer theoretical developments have shown that it is possible to overcome the static aspect of CPT. Veneris (1984) developed a theoretical model which starts with (a) a system of evenly distributed ("medieval") towns; (b) new economic activities are located in some towns thus causing differentiation and evolution into an hierarchical ("industrial") city system; (c) further differentiation leads into a post-hierarchical ("postindustrial") city system.
This evolution can be modelled by means of the three major CPT theories: stage (a) is a system of von Thunen "isolated states"; stage (b) is a Christallerian hierarchical system; stage (c) is a Löschian post-hierarchical system. Furthermore, stage (b) corresponds to [[Christopher Alexander]]'s "tree" city, while (c) is similar to his "lattice" system (following his dictum "the city is not a tree").

==The importance of a City and other Theoretical Considerations==
According to Smith, Walter Christaller erred in his development of CPT in 1930 by using size of population and number of telephones in determining the importance of a city.  Smith recognized that although population size was important to the area served by a city, the '''number of kinds of services''' offered there was more important as a measure of the importance of a city in attracting consumers.  In applying CPT to describe the delivery of medical care in California, Smith counted the number of physician specialties to determine the importance of a city in the delivery of medical care.

Christaller also erred in the assumption that cities "emerge".  In California and much of the United States, many cities were situated by the railroads at the time the tracks were laid.  In California, towns founded by the railroads were 12 miles apart, the amount of track a section crew could maintain in the 1850s; larger towns were 60 miles apart, the distance a steam engine could travel before needing water.  Older towns were founded a day's horse ride apart by the Spanish priests who founded early missions.

In medical care regions described by Smith, there is a hierarchy of services, with primary care ideally distributed throughout an area, middle sized cities offering secondary care, and metropolitan areas with tertiary care.  Income, size of population, population demographics, distance to the next service center, all had an influence on the number and kind of specialists located in a population center. (Smith, 1977, 1979)

For example, orthopedic surgeons are found in ski areas, obstetricians in the suburbs, and boutique specialties such as hypnosis, plastic surgery, psychiatry are more likely to be found in high income areas. It was possible to estimate the size of population (threshold) needed to support a specialty, and also to link specialties that needed to cooperate and locate near each other, such as hematology, oncology, and pathology, or cardiology, thoracic surgery and pulmonology.

Her work is important for the study of physician location—where physicians choose to practice and where their practices will have a sufficient population size to support them. The income level of the population determines whether sufficient physicians will practice in an area and whether public subsidy is needed to maintain the health of the population.

The distribution of medical care in California followed patterns having to do with the settlement of cities.  Cities and their hinterlands having characteristics of the Traffic Principle (See K=4 above) usually have six thoroughfares through them—the thoroughfares including highways, rivers, railroads, and canals.  They are most efficient and can deliver the lowest cost services because transportation is cheaper.  Those having settled on the market principle (K=3 above) have more expensive services and goods, as they were founded at times when transportation was more primitive.  In Appalachia, for example, the market principle still prevails and rural medical care is much more expensive.

== Making Central Place Theory operational ==
CPT is often criticized as being "unrealistic". However, several studies show that it can describe existing urban systems.  An important issue is that Christaller's original formulation is incorrect in several ways (Smith). These errors become apparent if we try to make CPT "operational", that is if we try to derive numerical data out of the theoretical schemata. These problems have been identified for by Veneris (1984) and subsequently by Openshaw and Veneris (2003), who provided also theoretically sound and consistent solutions, based on a K=3, 37-centre CP system:

1. Closure problem. Christaller's original scheme implies an infinite landscape. Although each market has finite size, the total system has no boundaries to it. Neither Christaller, nor the early related literature provide any guidance as to how the system can be "contained". Openshaw and Veneris (2003) identified three different types of closure, namely (a) isolated state, (b) territorial closure and (c) functional closure. Each closure type implies different population patterns.

2. Generating trips. Following the basic Christallerian logic and the closure types identified, Openshaw and Veneris (2003) calculate trip patterns between the 27 centres.

3. Calculating inter- and intra-zonal costs/distances. Christaller assumed freedom of movement in all directions, which would imply "airline" distances between centres. At the same time, he provided specific road networks for the CP system, which do not allow for airline distances. This is a major flaw which neither Christaller, nor early related literature have identified.  Openshaw and Veneris (2003) calculate costs/distances which are consistent with the Christallerian principles.

=== Central Place Theory and Spatial Interaction Models ===
{{Details|Spatial Interaction Models}}
It was once thought that central place theory is not compatible with spatial interaction models (SIM). It is paradoxical however that some times towns or shopping centres are planned with CPT, and subsequently evaluated with SIM.

Openshaw and Veneris (2003) succeeded in linking these two major regional theories in a clear and theoretically consistent way: using the data they derived from the operationalization of CPT, they experimented with several SIM. Following a thorough investigation via computer simulation, they reached important theoretical and practical conclusions.

Smith was able to delineate medical care regions (the range), describe the hierarchy of medical services, the population base required of each medical specialty (threshold), the efficiency of regions, and the importance of how an area was settled to the delivery of medical care, that is, according to traffic, market or administrative principles. What is central place?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9988">The '''Creative Energy Homes'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/creative-energy-homes/index.aspx|publisher=The University of Nottingham|title=Creative Energy Homes project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (CEH) project is a showcase of innovative state-of-the-art energy-efficient homes of the future. Seven homes constructed on the [[Campuses of the University of Nottingham#University Park Campus|University Park Campus]] of the [[University of Nottingham]] are being designed and constructed to various degrees of innovation and flexibility to allow the testing of different aspects of modern methods of construction including layout and form, cladding materials, roof structures, foundations, glazing materials, thermal performance, building services systems, sustainable/[[renewable energy]] technologies, lighting systems, acoustics and water supply. The project aims to stimulate sustainable design ideas and promote new ways of providing affordable, environmentally sustainable housing that are innovative in their design. The homes are fully instrumented and occupied in order to provide comprehensive post occupancy evaluation data.

== The David Wilson House ==
[[File:CEH DavidWilsonHouse.jpg|thumb|left|The David Wilson Ecohouse]] Construction of the CEH project began in 1999 with the David Wilson Ecohouse.
This is a 4-bedroom detached property which uses brick and block construction. Its main purpose was to support research into domestic-sized renewable energy systems such as micro-CHP ([[Combined heat and power]]), [[solar thermal]], micro-wind, [[Light tube|sun pipes]], and natural ventilation devices.

The house is currently used as office space for University of Nottingham staff and continues to be used as a test bed for University research projects.

== The BASF House ==
The [http://www.house.basf.co.uk/ BASF house] was the 3rd house to be constructed and was completed in January 2008 taking only 25 weeks to build. The house was designed by Derek Trowell Architects [http://derektrowellarchitects.co.uk/basf-house/] to demonstrate that it is possible to build an affordable low energy house whilst still adherering to the [[Passivhaus]] ideology. It meets the level 4 standard of the [[Code for Sustainable Homes]].

The house has a compact floor area and relies as much as possible on passive solar design to keep costs down. The north, east and west walls are highly insulated, with the minimum number of openings compatible with acceptable day lighting standards. The southern elevation consists of a fully glazed two-layer adjustable sunspace with glazed screens that can be opened or closed to facilitate heating or cooling.

A [[Ground-coupled heat exchanger|ground-air heat exchanger]], supplied by [http://www.rehau.co.uk/ Rehau], lies to the front of the house and this consists of a network of horizontal pipes buried approximately 2m underground. At this depth the soil temperature only varies between 8-12°C throughout the year. Therefore in winter cold air can be pre-heated before being drawn into the house and in the summer the air can be cooled.

A [[rainwater harvesting]] system has also been installed, which consists of a 3500 litres tank buried under the car parking space. It collects the run-off water from the roof. This water can be used for washing clothes, watering the garden, flushing the toilet and general cleaning. Water efficiency is also an important factor of the code for sustainable homes and using a rainwater harvesting system drastically reduces the amount of mains water used per person per day.

The [[Passive solar building design|sun space]], at the front of the house captures the solar gain from the sun, heating the air for use in the rest of the house. The south facing elevation is almost 100% glazed and the north facing elevation 30% glazed, providing improved quality of life in the home by maximising the use of natural daylight and reducing the energy required to light the home.

On the roof of the house are 3 solar thermal panels used for hot water heating. This is a larger system than is typical for this size of house, which allows storage of hot water for as long as 3 days and helps compensate for extended periods of overcast conditions.

== The E.ON 2016 House ==
The [http://www.eon-uk.com/about/2016house.aspx E.ON House] is a replica 1930s UK semi-detached house built primarily to research the impact of various retrofitting solutions on the existing housing stock.

According to the [[Code for Sustainable Homes]] (CfSH) all the new houses built from 2016 are required to meet Level 6 requirements of the CfSH, or be carbon zero. However, it is estimated that by the year 2050, 25 million existing UK homes will still account for between 70 and 90 percent of the housing stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Existing Housing and Climate Change|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmcomloc/432/432i.pdf|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 25% of UK CO2 emissions derive from the domestic housing stock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Firth|first=Steven|title=Investigating CO2 emissions reduction in existing urban housing using a community domestic energy model|url=http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2009/BS09_2098_2105.pdf|work=Proceedings of the Eleventh International IBPSA Conference|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; so clearly there is a large opportunity to reduce UK carbon emissions by increasing the efficiency of existing homes.

The house is built to 1930s building regulations and the project developers had to receive special planning permission in order to construct the house. It has no roof or wall cavity insulation and uses single glazed windows. Hot water is provided by an outdated, inefficient non-condensing gas boiler and immersion heater. The plan is to bring this 1930s house to a top of the range home meeting Level 6 CfSH. It is hoped that the lessons learnt from this detailed research will help point the way to retrofitting homes to create more sustainable properties. The project consists of three phases:

# During the first phase the house was monitored in its original state. There are over 100 sensors positioned around the house monitoring temperature, relative humidity, electricity consumption of individual appliances, gas consumption, water consumption, total electricity consumption and occupancy.
# The second phase was carried out from August 2010 to June 2011. The building was upgraded with additional insulation, an improved heating system, double glazing, more efficient lighting and drought proofing. Research was carried out as to the impact of these improvements.
# In the third phase, due to begin in late 2011, further improvements will be made incorporating the installation of a conservatory-style extension creating a buffer zone between the property and the outside elements and a sun space to maximise solar gain. Renewable energy technologies, such as [[Photovoltaic panels|Solar panel]]  and solar hot water system will also be installed in order to supply the house with electricity and hot water.

== The Tarmac Homes ==
Tarmac have sponsored the construction of two semi-detached eco-homes called [http://www.tarmachomesproject.co.uk/ Tarmac House]. These are designed by [http://www.zedfactory.com/ ZEDfactory], the company responsible for the [[BEDZED]] project in south London. One home is built to Level 4 CfSH  and the other to Level 6 CfSH.

These houses demonstrate that it is possible to build a sustainable home using currently available materials and traditional methods of construction. Sustainability features of the properties include:

* Extremely well insulated walls with 250&amp;nbsp;mm of [[cavity wall insulation]].
* A [[Biomass heating system]] situated in front of the houses.
* A [[Solar water heating]] system with roof-mounted solar panels.
* [http://solarcentury.com/ Solar century] sun slates on the level 6 house helping to meet electricity demands.

== The Nottingham H.O.U.S.E (Home Optimising the Use of Solar Energy) ==
[http://www.nottinghamhouse.co.uk/ Nottingham H.O.U.S.E] is a small family "starter" home, which was built as a part of a [[Solar Decathlon Europe]] 2010 event by the students of the [http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/engineering/Departments/abe/index.aspx Department of Architecture and Built Environment]. The house delivers a zero carbon sustainable design solution that is compliant with level 6 of UK's Code for Sustainable Homes. It is a prefabricated two storey house with a courtyard garden that can be used in terrace or semi-detached form.

The House was presented at the [http://www.ecobuild.co.uk/ Ecobuild] 2010 event and awarded with the prize for the best use of timber. The models of the house were also presented at the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai Expo 2010]]. The prefabricated house is due to be moved on to the University Park campus of the University of Nottingham in the near future.

== The Mark Group House ==
The Mark Group house is currently under construction.  It is a 4-bedroom property constructed using a steel framing system with insulation cladding. Construction of the basement uses an [[Insulating concrete form|Insulating Concrete Form]] (ICF) which incorporates [[Ground granulated blast furnace slag|Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag]] (GGBS) into the [[Portland cement]].

Manufacturing Portland cement produces around 1 tonne of CO2 per tonne of concrete whereas GGBS, as a by-product of the iron industry, produces only 0.1 tonnes of CO2 per tonne{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. GGBS can be mixed with Portland cement 70%-30% to decrease its carbon footprint by around 40%{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.

In [[computer security]], the "dancing pigs" is a term or problem that describes computer users' attitudes to computer security. It states that users will continue to pick an amusing graphic even if they receive a warning from security software that it is potentially dangerous. In other words, users choose their primary desire features without considering the security. "Dancing pigs" is generally used by tech experts and can be found in IT articles.

== Origins ==
The term has its origin in a remark by [[Edward Felten]] and [[Gary McGraw]]:
{{cquote|Given a choice between dancing pigs and security, users will pick dancing pigs every time.&lt;ref&gt;Gary McGraw and Edward Felten: ''[http://www.securingjava.com/ Securing Java]'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999; {{ISBN|0-471-31952-X}}), Chapter one, Part seven&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Bruce Schneier]] states:
{{quote| The user's going to pick dancing pigs over security every time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mills|first=Elinor|title=Q&amp;A: Schneier warns of marketers and dancing pigs|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10381460-245.html|accessdate=12 February 2013|newspaper=CNET|date=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Bruce Schneier expands on this remark as follows:
{{quote|If [[J. Random Websurfer]] clicks on a button that promises dancing pigs on his computer monitor, and instead gets a hortatory message describing the potential dangers of the applet&amp;nbsp;— he's going to choose dancing pigs over computer security any day. If the computer prompts him with a warning screen like: "The applet DANCING PIGS could contain malicious code that might do permanent damage to your computer, steal your life's savings, and impair your ability to have children," he'll click OK without even reading it. Thirty seconds later he won't even remember that the warning screen even existed.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Schneier: ''[[Secrets and Lies (Schneier)|Secrets and Lies]]'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2000; {{ISBN|0-471-45380-3}}), p262&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Mozilla]] Security Reviewers' Guide states:
{{quote|Many of our potential users are inexperienced computer users, who do not understand the risks involved in using interactive Web content. This means we must rely on the user's judgement as little as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/reviewguide.html |title= Mozilla Security Review and Best Practices Guide |date= 17 May 2002 |accessdate= 2 February 2015 |publisher= [[Mozilla Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A widely publicized 2009 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Please Do Not Change Your Password|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/04/11/please_do_not_change_your_password/|first=Mark|last=Pothier|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=11 April 2010|accessdate= 2 February 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; directly addresses the dancing pigs quotation and argues that users' behavior is plausibly rational:
{{quote|While amusing, this is unfair: users are never offered security, either on its own or as an alternative to anything else. They are offered long, complex and growing sets of advice, mandates, policy updates and tips. These sometimes carry vague and tentative suggestions of reduced risk, never security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=So Long and No Thanks for the Externalities: the Rational Rejection of Security Advice by Users|conference=New Security Paradigms Workshop|conferenceurl=http://www.nspw.org/2009/|year=2009|author=Cormac Herley|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cormac/papers/2009/SoLongAndNoThanks.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Experimental support ==
One study of [[phishing]] found that people really do prefer dancing animals to security. The study showed participants a number of phishing sites, including one that copied the [[Bank of the West]] home page:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Phishing Works|author=Rachna Dhamija, J. D. Tygar and Marti Hearst|url=http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~rachna/papers/why_phishing_works.pdf|accessdate=2011-05-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306023403/http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~rachna/papers/why_phishing_works.pdf|archivedate=2008-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|For many participants the "cute" design, the level of detail and the fact that the site does not ask for a great deal of information were the most convincing factors. Two participants mentioned the animated bear video that appears on the page, (e.g., "because that would take a lot of effort to copy"). Participants in general found this animation appealing and many reloaded the page just to see the animation again.}}

Schneier believes the dancing pigs problem will lead to crime, a key threat. He said: "The tactics might change (...) as security measures make some tactics harder and others easier, but the underlying issue is constant." Ignoring computer security can inflict various types of damage resulting in significant losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mills|first=Elinor|title=Q&amp;A: Schneier warns of marketers and dancing pigs|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10381460-245.html|accessdate=12 February 2013|newspaper=CNET|date=October 23, 2009|quote=The tactics might change--phishing, pharming, key logging, social engineering, password guessing, whatever--as security measures make some tactics harder and others easier, but the underlying issue is constant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;  DBL, as well as [[project-based learning]] and [[problem-based learning]], is used to teach [[21st century skills]] such as [[communication]] and [[collaboration]] and foster [[deeper learning]].&lt;ref name="KSBE"&gt;[http://www.ksbe.edu/_assets/spi/pdfs/21_century_skills_full.pdf  ''21st Century Skills - for Students and Teachers'', Research and Evaluation, August 2010, Kamehameha Schools].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeper learning is supported when students design and create an artifact that requires understanding and application of knowledge. DBL activity supports [[iteration]] as students create, assess, and redesign their projects. The work's complexity often requires collaboration and specialized roles, providing students with the opportunity to become “experts” in a particular area.  Design projects require students to establish goals and constraints, generate ideas, and create prototypes through [[storyboarding]] or other representational practices.&lt;ref name="Edutopia1" /&gt; [[Robotics]] competitions in schools are popular design-based learning activities, wherein student teams design, build and then pilot their robots in competitive challenges. 
 
Design-based learning was developed in the 1980s by Doreen Nelson, a professor at [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]] and the [[Art Center College of Design]]. Her findings suggested that [[Kinesthetic learning|kinesthetic problem-solving]] helps students acquire, retain, and synthesize information in practical ways.&lt;ref&gt;[https://centerx.gseis.ucla.edu/partnerships-grants/tiip/showcase/virgil-project-portfolio/design-based-learning Design based learning, UCLA].

==Design process==
{{main article|Design process}}
The design process is an iterative process that has a variety of sequential steps:&lt;ref name="Mehalik"&gt;[http://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/Schunn/research/papers/MehaliketalJEE2008.pdf ''Middle-School Science Through Design- Based Learning versus Scripted Inquiry: Better Overall Science Concept Learning and Equity Gap Reduction'', Mehalik, Doppelt, Schunn.

[[File:ADDIE Model of Design.jpg|right|thumb|300px|ADDIE Model]]
A similar approach is the [[ADDIE Model]] of [[instructional design]], a framework of generic processes used by instructional designers and [[Training and development|training developers]].&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Gary R. Designing Effective Instruction, 6th Edition. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a descriptive guideline with five distinct phases:
* Analysis
* Design
* Development
* Implementation
* Evaluation

==Results==
Positive benefits of the design-based learning approach have been observed, including student-based learning where students (often) identify their project's needs, develop their own ideas, and engage in a larger range of thinking than with the traditional scripted inquiry model.&lt;ref name="Mehalik" /&gt; The results from the 2008 study by Mehalik et al. found significant improvement in student performance using the DBL model compared to the scripted model.&lt;ref name="Mehalik" /&gt;  A 1998 study (Fraser, Fraser &amp; Tobin, 1991) suggest that DBL has the potential to increase students’ desire to learn, enhance success in science class, and increase  interest in science topics. Students were observed to be engaged in DBL and the lower-achieving students were able to explain concepts at higher levels than previously observed by their teacher. In-depth experience in design activities and creation of meaningful outcomes in technology were observed in terms of the finished product, documentation, and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JTE/v19n2/doppelt ''Engagement and Achievements:  A Case Study of Design-Based Learning in a Science Context,'' Doppelt, Mehalik, Schunn, Silk, Krysinski].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Significant benefits of implementing DBL has been observed in the areas of math and science (Darling-Hammond et al., 2008).&lt;ref name="KSBE" /&gt;  Research has found that students who participate in learning by design projects have a more systematic understanding of a system’s parts and functions that control groups (Hmelo, Holton, &amp; Kolodner, 2000).&lt;ref name="KSBE" /&gt;

A 2000 study (Hmelo, Holton, and Kolodner) found that the design project led to better learning outcomes and included deeper learning than the traditional learning approach. The researchers also noted that the students developed greater understanding of complex systems.  The study found that in using DBL, both higher-achieving and lower-achieving students showed strong evidence of progress in learning the targeted concepts, students were able to apply key concepts in their work, and there were positive effects on motivation and sense of ownership over work product by both groups and individual students.&lt;ref name="Edutopia1" /&gt;

==Implementation==
The teaching of [[21st century skills]] is more effective when teachers gain expertise in both the practice and the teaching of these skills, in effect becoming successful 21st century learners in the areas of:  communication and collaboration amongst teachers and with students; being flexible with new classroom dynamics; fostering independent student learning; adapting teaching and learning styles to new pedagogical approaches.

Challenges to implementing DBL include developing the skills of the instructors:&lt;ref name="KSBE" /&gt; 
* teachers' ability to select topics and activities that support, and benefit from, differing viewpoints and students' real-world experiences 
* selecting students who will work well together
* setting of effective ground rules to ensure equal opportunities to participate, 
* encouraging multiple strategies to foster full participation for all members of a group of team.

[[Australia]]'s [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] describes discretionary foods as ''“foods and drinks not necessary to provide the nutrients the body needs, but that may add variety. However, many of these are high in saturated fats, sugars, salt and/or alcohol, and are therefore described as energy dense. They can be included sometimes in small amounts by those who are physically active, but are not a necessary part of the diet.”''&lt;ref name="abs" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9277">The '''ELIZA effect''', in [[computer science]], is the tendency to unconsciously assume computer behaviors are analogous to human behaviors, that is [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphisation]].

==Overview==
In its specific form, the ELIZA effect refers only to "the susceptibility of people to read far more understanding than is warranted into strings of symbols—especially words—strung together by computers".&lt;ref name="Hofstadter1996"&gt;{{
cite book |author=Hofstadter, Douglas R.|year=1996|title=Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=somvbmHCaOEC|chapter=Preface 4 The Ineradicable Eliza Effect and Its Dangers, Epilogue|chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=somvbmHCaOEC&amp;pg=PA157|page=157|publisher=Basic Books|isbn= 978-0-465-02475-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trivial example of the specific form of the Eliza effect, given by [[Douglas Hofstadter]], involves an [[automated teller machine]] which displays the words "THANK YOU" at the end of a transaction. A (very) casual observer might think that the machine is actually expressing gratitude; however, the machine is only printing a preprogrammed string of symbols.&lt;ref name=Hofstadter1996/&gt;

More generally, the ELIZA effect describes any situation&lt;ref name="Fenton-Kerr1999"&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=GAIA: An Experimental Pedagogical Agent for Exploring Multimodal Interaction|title=Computation for Metaphors, Analogy, and Agents|last=Fenton-Kerr|first=Tom|year=1999|publisher=Springer|page=156|doi=10.1007/3-540-48834-0_9|quote=''Although Hofstadter is emphasizing the text mode here, the "Eliza effect" can be seen in almost all modes of human/computer interaction.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ekbia2008"&gt;{{cite book|title=Artificial Dreams: The Quest for Non-Biological Intelligence|last=Ekbia|first=Hamid R.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-521-87867-8|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wEIlNjO0x0C&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, based solely on a system's output, users perceive computer systems as having "intrinsic qualities and abilities which the software controlling the (output) cannot possibly achieve"&lt;ref name="King1995"&gt;{{Cite techreport|title=Anthropomorphic Agents: Friend, Foe, or Folly|first=W.|last=King|id=M-95-1|publisher=University of Washington|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "assume that [outputs] reflect a greater causality than they actually do".&lt;ref name="Rouse2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Organizational Simulation|last=Rouse|first=William B.|last2=Boff|first2=Kenneth R.|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|year=2005|isbn=978-0-471-73943-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=371wV4dI7ckC&amp;pg=PA308|pages=308–309|quote=''This is a particular problem in digital environments where the "Eliza effect" as it is sometimes called causes interactors to assume that the system is more intelligent than it is, to assume that events reflect a greater causality than they actually do.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both its specific and general forms, the ELIZA effect is notable for occurring even when users of the system are aware of the [[determinate]] nature of output produced by the system. From a psychological standpoint, the ELIZA effect is the result of a subtle [[cognitive dissonance]] between the user's awareness of programming limitations and their behavior towards the output of the [[computer program|program]].&lt;ref name="Ekbia2008_quote"&gt;{{cite book|title=Artificial Dreams: The Quest for Non-Biological Intelligence|last=Ekbia|first=Hamid R.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-521-87867-8|page=156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4wEIlNjO0x0C&amp;pg=PA156|quote=''But people '''want''' to believe that the program is "seeing" a football game at some plausible level of abstraction.

Collins of course knew that his program didn't deal with anything resembling a two-dimensional world of smoothly moving dots (let alone simplified human bodies), and presumably he thought that his readers, too, would realize this. He couldn't have suspected, however, how powerful the Eliza effect is.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the ELIZA effect was an important development in [[artificial intelligence]], demonstrating the principle of using [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering]] rather than explicit programming to pass a [[Turing test]].&lt;ref name="Trappl2002"&gt;{{cite book|title=Emotions in Humans and Artifacts|last=Trappl|first=Robert|last2=Petta|first2=Paolo|last3=Payr|first3=Sabine|page=353|year=2002|isbn=978-0-262-20142-1|quote=''The "Eliza effect" — the tendency for people to treat programs that respond to them as if they had more intelligence than they really do (Weizenbaum 1966) is one of the most powerful tools available to the creators of virtual characters.''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jTgMIhy6YZMC&amp;pg=PA353|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

The effect is named for the 1966 [[chatterbot]] [[ELIZA]], developed by MIT computer scientist [[Joseph Weizenbaum]]. When executing Weizenbaum's ''DOCTOR'' [[scripting language|script]], ELIZA parodied a [[Rogerian psychotherapy|Rogerian]] [[psychotherapist]], largely by rephrasing the "patient{{"'}}s replies as questions:

:Human: Well, my boyfriend made me come here.
:ELIZA: Your boyfriend made you come here?
:Human: He says I'm depressed much of the time.
:ELIZA: I am sorry to hear you are depressed.
:Human: It's true. I'm unhappy.
:ELIZA: Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy?&lt;ref name="Güzeldere1"&gt;{{cite web |title=dialogues with colorful personalities of early ai |last=Güzeldere |first=Güven |author2=Franchi, Stefano |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/SHR/4-2/text/dialogues.html |accessdate=2007-07-30 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uQo99jVH?url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/SHR/4-2/text/dialogues.html |archivedate=2010-11-22 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''East European Politics''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] academic journal covering the [[government]], [[politics]] and [[international relations]] of the post-communist space, including East Central Europe, the Baltic republics, South Eastern Europe, and the Western Balkans, as well as all the countries of the former Soviet Union. It is published quarterly (4 issues per year) by [[Routledge]] ([[Taylor &amp; Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis Group]])'''.''' The editors-in-chief are '''Adam Fagan''' ([[Queen Mary University of London]]) and '''Petr Kopecky''' ([[Leiden University]]).

== Journal information ==
''East European Politics'' publishes original scholarship on political developments in individual countries, together with cross-country comparative analyses and studies of the relations between post-communist regions and other parts of the world, including internationally based organizations such as the [[European Union]].

In addition to research articles and book reviews, ''East European Politics'' publishes thematic special issues as well. The journal also publishes regular ‘symposium’ sections and review articles devoted to briefer analysis of particular events, political issues and important theoretical and conceptual developments. All research articles in ''East European Politics'' have undergone rigorous peer review, based on initial editor screening and anonymized refereeing by at least two anonymous referees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=fjcs21|title=East European Politics :|website=www.tandfonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history ==
The ''Journal of Communist Studies'' was founded in 1984 by a group of scholars (Michael Waller, Richard Gillespie, Ron Hill, David Goodman, David Bell, and Michael Williams) with a shared intellectual interest in communist political systems, successors to an editorial team that had produced ''Documents in communist affairs'' (published in the early 1980s by Butterworths) and other publications dealing with the communist movement. While the journal set out to reflect the growing complexity of the communist world and movements, in the 1980s, its focus was on the ‘core’ countries and parties that had historically been part of the world of the [[Communist International]]. The primary emphasis was on politics, but history, sociology, non-technical economics, biography, and comparative studies also featured.

In 1992, ''and Transition Politics'' was added to the title to reflect changing realities. Following the change of title, the scope both widened, to embrace regime change and democratisation, and in practice also narrowed, to concentrate somewhat more on political analysis. The volumes published under the revised title included analyses of the politics and political science of the new democracies, several of which are now considered to be seminal works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fagan|first=Adam|last2=Kopecky|first2=Petr|year=2012|title=East European politics (Editorial)|journal=East European Politics|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, the journal is published under the title ''East European Politics''.

== Abstracting and indexing ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3541">'''Environmental hermeneutics''' is a term for a wide range of scholarship that applies the techniques and resources of the [[philosophy|philosophical]] field of [[hermeneutics]] to environmental issues. That is to say it addresses issues of interpretation as they relate to [[nature]] and environmental issues broadly conceived to include [[wilderness]], [[ecosystems]], [[landscapes]], [[ecology]], the built environment ([[architecture]]), [[life]], embodiment, and more. Work in [[environmental philosophy]], [[ecocriticism]], [[environmental theology]], [[ecotheology]], and similar disciplines may overlap the field of environmental hermeneutics.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the public sphere, much of the focus on “the environment” is concerned with discovering scientific facts and then reporting how policy can act on these facts.  On its face, philosophical hermeneutics might appear to be an unrelated enterprise. But... even the facts of the sciences are given meaning by how humans interpret them. Of course this does not mean that there are no facts, or that all facts must come from scientific discourse. Rather... [it calls] for mediation—the ''mediation that grounds the interpretive task of connecting fact and meaning'' through a number of different structures and forms. &lt;small&gt;(Clingerman, et al. 2013, emphasis added)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clingerman, F. |author2=Treanor, B. |author3=Drenthen, M. |author4= Utsler, D. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Interpreting Nature: The Emerging Field of Environmental Hermeneutics|year=2013|page=1|publisher=Fordham University Press|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/book/26563}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70298">{{For|the condition characterized by [[comorbidity]] of a specific set of impairments to executive functioning|Dysexecutive syndrome}}

In [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]], '''executive dysfunction''', or '''executive function deficit''', is a disruption to the efficacy of the [[executive functions]], which is a group of [[cognitive processes]] that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott R (2003). Executive functions and their disorders. British Medical Bulletin. (65); 49–59&lt;/ref&gt; Executive dysfunction can refer to both [[neurocognitive]] deficits and behavioural [[symptom]]s. It is implicated in numerous [[Psychopathology#As a descriptive term|psychopathologies]] and [[mental disorder]]s, as well as short-term and long-term changes in non-clinical executive control.

Executive dysfunction is not the same as [[dysexecutive syndrome]], a term coined by [[Alan Baddeley]] to describe a common pattern of dysfunction in executive functions, such as deficiencies in [[planning]], abstract thinking, [[Cognitive flexibility|flexibility]] and behavioural control.&lt;ref name="Wilson et al"&gt;Wilson, B.A., Evans, J.J., Emslie, H., Alderman, N., &amp; Burgess, P. (1998). The development of an ecologically valid test for assessing patients with a dysexecutive syndrome. ''Neuropsychological Rehabilitation, 8'', 213-228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Baddeley, A."&gt;Baddeley, A., &amp; Wilson, B. (1988). Frontal amnesia and the dysexecutive syndrome. ''Brain and Cognition, 7'', 212-230.&lt;/ref&gt; This group of symptoms, usually resulting from brain damage, tend to occur together.&lt;ref&gt;Halligan, P.W., Kischka, U., &amp; Marshall, J.C. (2004). ''Handbook of clinical neuropsychology.'' Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the existence of dysexecutive syndrome is [[Dysexecutive syndrome#Controversy|controversial]].&lt;ref name="Stuss et. al"&gt;Stuss, D.T. &amp; Alexander, M.P. (2007). Is there a dysexecutive syndrome? ''Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences, 362'' (1481), 901-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Executive functioning]] is a theoretical construct representing a domain of cognitive processes that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes. Executive functioning is not a unitary concept; it is a broad description of the set of processes involved in certain areas of cognitive and behavioural control.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt; Executive processes are integral to higher [[brain function]], particularly in the areas of goal formation, planning, goal-directed action, [[self-monitoring]], [[attention]], response inhibition, and coordination of complex cognition and motor control for effective performance.&lt;ref name="Jurado Rosselli"&gt;Jurado MB, Rosselli M (2007). The elusive nature of executive functions: a review of our current understanding. Neuropsychol Rev, 17(3):213–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Deficits of the executive functions are observed in all populations to varying degrees, but severe executive dysfunction can have devastating effects on cognition and behaviour in both individual and social contexts.

Executive dysfunction does occur to a minor degree in all individuals on both short-term and long-term scales. In non-clinical populations, the activation of executive processes appears to inhibit further activation of the same processes, suggesting a mechanism for normal fluctuations in executive control.&lt;ref name="Schmeichel 2007"&gt;Schmeichel, BJ (2007). Attention Control, memory updating, and emotion regulation temporarily reduce the capacity for executive control. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 136(2):241–55&lt;/ref&gt; Decline in executive functioning is also associated with both normal and clinical aging.&lt;ref name="Zelazo et al"&gt;Zelazo PD, Craik FI, Booth L (2004). Executive function across the life span. Acta Psychol (Amst), 115 (2–3):167–83.&lt;/ref&gt; In aging populations, the decline of memory processes appears to affect executive functions, which also points to the general role of memory in executive functioning.&lt;ref name="Bisiacchi"&gt;Bisiacchi PS, Borella E, Bergamaschi S, Carretti B, Mondini S (2008). Interplay between memory and executive functions in normal and pathological aging. J Clin Exp Neuropsychol, 30(6):723–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive dysfunction appears to consistently involve disruptions in task-oriented behavior, which requires executive control in the inhibition of habitual responses and goal activation.&lt;ref name="Nieuwen"&gt;Nieuwenhuis S, Broerse A, Nielen MM, de Jong R (2004). A goal activation approach to the study of executive function: an application to antisaccade tasks. Brain Cogn. 56(2):198–214. Review.&lt;/ref&gt; Such executive control is responsible for adjusting behaviour to reconcile environmental changes with goals for effective behaviour.&lt;ref name="Verbruggen Logan"/&gt; Impairments in set shifting ability are a notable feature of executive dysfunction; set shifting is the cognitive ability to dynamically change focus between points of fixation based on changing goals and environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name="Avila"&gt;Avila C, Barros A, Ortet G, Parcet MA &amp; Ibanez M I (2003). Set-shifting and sensitivity to reward: A possible dopamine mechanism for explaining disinhibitory disorders. Cognition and Emotion, 17, 951–59.&lt;/ref&gt; This offers a parsimonious explanation for the common occurrence of impulsive, hyperactive, disorganized, and [[aggressive behaviour]] in clinical patients with executive dysfunction. Executive dysfunction, particularly in [[working memory]] capacity, may also lead to varying degrees of emotional dysregulation, which can manifest as chronic [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], or [[hyperemotionality]].&lt;ref name="Schmeichel 2008"&gt;Schmeichel BJ, Volokhov RN &amp; Demaree HA (2008). Working memory capacity and the Self-Regulation of Emotional Expression and Experience" ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' 95(6), 1526–40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Barkley]] proposed a hybrid model of the role of behavioural disinhibition in the presentation of ADHD, which has served as the basis for much research of both ADHD and broader implications of the executive system.&lt;ref name="Barkley 1997"/&gt;

Other common and distinctive symptoms of executive dysfunction include utilization behaviour, which is compulsive manipulation/use of nearby objects due simply to their presence and accessibility (rather than a functional reason); and [[imitation]] behaviour, a tendency to rely on imitation as a primary means of [[social interaction]].&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;Hoffmann MW, &amp; Bill PLA (1992). The environmental dependency syndrome, imitation behaviour and utilization behaviour as presenting symptoms of bilateral frontal lobe infarction due to moyamoya disease. South African Medical Journal, 81(5): 271–73&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that executive set shifting is a co-mediator with [[episodic memory]] of [[Children's use of information#Feeling-of-Knowing (FOK)|feeling-of-knowing]] (FOK) accuracy, such that executive dysfunction may reduce FOK accuracy.&lt;ref name="Perrotin"&gt;Perrotin A, Tournell L, Isingrini M (2008). Executive functioning and memory as potential mediators of the episodic feeling-of-knowing accuracy" ''Brain and Cognition'' 67:76–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence suggesting that executive dysfunction may produce beneficial effects as well as maladaptive ones. Abraham et al.&lt;ref name="Abraham 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abraham |first1=A |last2=Windmann |first2=S |last3=McKenna |first3=P |last4=Güntürkün |first4=O |date=May 2007 |title=Creative thinking in schizophrenia: the role of executive dysfunction and symptom severity |journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=235–58 |pmid=17453904 |doi=10.1080/13546800601046714}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate that creative thinking in schizophrenia is mediated by executive dysfunction, and they establish a firm [[etiology]] for creativity in psychoticism, pinpointing a cognitive preference for broader top-down associative thinking versus goal-oriented thinking, which closely resembles aspects of ADHD. It is postulated that elements of [[psychosis]] are present in both ADHD and schizophrenia/[[schizotypy]] due to [[dopamine]] overlap.&lt;ref name="Keshavan"&gt;Keshavan MS, Sujata M, Mehra A, Montrose DM, Sweeney JA (2003). Psychosis proneness and ADHD in young relatives of schizophrenia patients. Schizophrenia Research, 59(1), 85–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause ==
The cause of executive dysfunction is heterogeneous,&lt;ref name="Nigg 2006"&gt;Nigg JT (2006). What causes ADHD?: Understanding what goes wrong and why. New York, NY: Guilford Press. {{ISBN|1-59385-267-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59385-267-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as many [[neurocognitive]] processes are involved in the executive system and each may be compromised by a range of genetic and environmental factors. Learning and development of long-term memory play a role in the severity of executive dysfunction through dynamic interaction with neurological characteristics. Studies in cognitive neuroscience suggest that executive functions are widely distributed throughout the brain, though a few areas have been isolated as primary contributors. Executive dysfunction is studied extensively in clinical neuropsychology as well, allowing correlations to be drawn between such dysexecutive symptoms and their neurological correlates.

Executive processes are closely integrated with memory retrieval capabilities for overall cognitive control; in particular, goal/task-information is stored in both short-term and long-term memory, and effective performance requires effective storage and retrieval of this information.&lt;ref name="Verbruggen Logan"&gt;Verbruggen F, Logan GD. (2008). Long-term aftereffects of response inhibition: memory retrieval, task goals, and cognitive control. J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform, 34(5):1229–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive dysfunction characterizes many of the symptoms observed in numerous [[#Executive dysfunction in clinical populations|clinical populations]]. In the case of [[acquired brain injury]] and neurodegenerative diseases there is a clear neurological etiology producing dysexecutive symptoms. Conversely, [[syndromes]] and [[Mental disorder|disorders]] are defined and diagnosed based on their symptomatology rather than etiology. Thus, while Parkinson's disease, a [[neurodegenerative]] condition, causes executive dysfunction, a disorder such as [[ADHD|attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]] is a classification given to a set of subjectively-determined symptoms implicating executive dysfunction – current models indicate that such clinical symptoms are caused by executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Barkley 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nigg 2006"/&gt;

=== Neurophysiology ===
As previously mentioned, executive functioning is not a unitary concept.&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt; Many studies have been conducted in an attempt to pinpoint the exact regions of the brain that lead to executive dysfunction, producing a vast amount of often conflicting information indicating wide and inconsistent distribution of such functions. A common assumption is that disrupted executive control processes are associated with pathology in [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] brain regions.&lt;ref name ="Clark"&gt;Clark C, Gallo J, Glosser G, Grossman M (2002). Memory encoding and retrieval in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Neuropsychology. 16(2); 190–96&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported to some extent by the primary literature, which shows both pre-frontal activation and communication between the pre-frontal cortex and other areas associated with executive functions such as the [[basal ganglia]] and [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref name="Nigg 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berquin 1998"&gt;Berquin PC, Giedd JN, Jacobsen LK, Hamburger SD, Krain AL, Rapoport JL, Castellanos FX (1998). Cerebellum in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: A morphometric MRI study" ''Neurology'' 50, 1087–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases of executive dysfunction, deficits are attributed to either frontal lobe damage or dysfunction, or to disruption in fronto-subcortical connectivity.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; Neuroimaging with [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and [[fMRI]] has confirmed the relationship between executive function and functional frontal pathology.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; Neuroimaging studies have also suggested that some constituent functions are not discretely localized in prefrontal regions.&lt;ref name = "Carpenter"&gt;Carpenter P, Just M &amp; Reichle E (2000). Working memory and executive function: evidence from neuroimaging. Current Opinion in Neurobiology. 10; 195–99&lt;/ref&gt; Functional imaging studies using different tests of executive function have implicated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to be the primary site of cortical activation during these tasks.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"&gt;Dougherty D, Ottowitz W, Savage C (2002). Neural network basis for abnormalities of attention and executive function in major depressive disorder: implications for application of the medical disease model to psychiatric disorders. Harvard Review of Psychology. 10(2); 86–99&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, PET studies of patients with Parkinson's disease have suggested that tests of executive function are associated with abnormal function in the [[globus pallidus]]&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; and appear to be the genuine result of [[basal ganglia]] damage.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt;

With substantial cognitive load, fMRI signals indicate a common network of frontal, parietal and occipital cortices, thalamus, and the cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;Caparelli E, Chang L, Ernst T et al. (2006). Different activation patterns for working memory load and visual attention load. Brain Research. 158–65&lt;/ref&gt; This observation suggests that executive function is mediated by dynamic and flexible networks that are characterized using functional integration and effective connectivity analyses.&lt;ref name = "Elliott"/&gt; The complete circuit underlying executive function includes both a direct and an indirect circuit.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"/&gt; The neural circuit responsible for executive functioning is, in fact, located primarily in the frontal lobe.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"/&gt; This main circuit originates in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex/orbitofrontal cortex and then projects through the [[striatum]] and [[thalamus]] to return to the prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty"/&gt;

Not surprisingly, plaques and tangles in the frontal cortex can cause disruption in functions as well as damage to the connections between prefrontal cortex and the [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref name = "Clark"/&gt; Another important point is in the finding that structural [[MRI]] images link the severity of white matter lesions to deficits in cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Buckner, R. (2004). Memory and executive function in aging and AD: multiple factors that cause decline and reserve factors that compensate" ''Neuron'' 44;195–208&lt;/ref&gt;

The emerging view suggests that cognitive processes materialize from networks that span multiple cortical sites with closely collaborative and over-lapping functions.&lt;ref name = "Carpenter"/&gt; A challenge for future research will be to map the multiple brain regions that might combine with each other in a vast number of ways, depending on the task requirements.&lt;ref name = "Carpenter"/&gt;

=== Genetics ===
Certain genes have been identified with a clear correlation to executive dysfunction and related psychopathologies. According to Friedman ''et al.'' (2008),&lt;ref name="Friedman 2008"&gt;Friedman, et al (2008). Individual differences in executive functions are almost entirely genetic in origin. Journal of experimental psychology, 137(2), 201–10.&lt;/ref&gt; the heritability of executive functions is among the highest of any psychological trait. The dopamine receptor D4 gene ([[DRD4]]) with 7'-repeating [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] (7R) has been repeatedly shown to correlate strongly with impulsive response style on psychological tests of executive dysfunction, particularly in clinical ADHD.&lt;ref name="Langley 2004"&gt;Langley K, Marshall L, Bree M van den, Thomas H, Owen M, O'Donovan M, Thapar A (2004). Association of the dopamine D4 receptor gene 7-repeat allele with neuropsychological test performance of children with ADHD" ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' 161(1),133–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The catechol-o-methyl transferase gene ([[COMT]]) codes for an enzyme that degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters (DA and NE), and its Val158Met polymorphism is linked with the modulation of task-oriented cognition and behavior (including set shifting&lt;ref name="Tunbridge"&gt;Tunbridge EM, Bannerman DM, Sharp T, Harrison PJ (2004). Catechol-o-methyltransferase inhibition improves set-shifting performance and elevates stimulated dopamine release in the rat prefrontal cortex" ''Journal of Neuroscience'' 24(23):5331–35.&lt;/ref&gt;) and the experience of reward, which are major aspects of executive functioning. COMT is also linked to methylphenidate (stimulant medication) response in children with ADHD.&lt;ref name="Sengupta 2008"&gt;Sengupta S, Grizenko N, Schmitz N, Schwartz G, Bellingham J, Polotskaia A, Stepanian MT, Goto Y, Grace AA, Joober R (2008). COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism and the modulation of task-oriented behavior in children with ADHD" ''Neuropsychopharmacology'' 2008, 13:3069–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the DRD4/7R and COMT/Val158Met polymorphisms are also correlated with executive dysfunction in schizophrenia and schizotypal behaviour.&lt;ref name="Alfimova 2007"&gt;Alfimova MV, Golimbet VE, Gritsenko IK, Lezheiko TV, Abramova LI, Strel'tsova MA, Khlopina IV, Ebstein R (2007). Interaction of dopamine system genes and cognitive functions in patients with schizophrenia and their relatives and in healthy subjects from the general population. Neuroscience Behaviour Physiology, 37(7), 643–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Testing and measurement ==
There are several measures that can be employed to assess the executive functioning capabilities of an individual. Although a trained non-professional working outside of an institutionalized setting can legally and competently perform many of these measures, a trained professional administering the test in a standardized setting will yield the most accurate results.&lt;ref name ="Daghar"&gt;Daghar A, Monchi O, Petre V et al (2001). "Wisconsin card revisited: distinct neural circuits participating in different stages of the task identified by event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging." ''The Journal of Neuroscience'' 21(19)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clock drawing test ===
The Clock drawing test (CDT) is a brief cognitive task that can be used by physicians who suspect neurological dysfunction based on history and physical examination. It is relatively easy to train non-professional staff to administer a CDT. Therefore, this is a test that can easily be administered in educational and geriatric settings and can be utilized as a precursory measure to indicate the likelihood of further/future deficits.&lt;ref name ="Shulman"&gt;Shulman, K (2000). Clock drawing: Is it the ideal cognitive screening test? International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry. 15(6); 548–61&lt;/ref&gt; Also, generational, educational and cultural differences are not perceived as impacting the utility of the CDT.&lt;ref&gt;Emond J, Galasko D, Hanson L. et al (2008). Spatial deficits predict rate of cognitive decline in autopsy-verified dementia with lewy bodies. Neuropsychology. 22(6); 729–37&lt;/ref&gt;

The procedure of the CDT begins with the instruction to the participant to draw a clock reading a specific time (generally 11:10). After the task is complete, the test administrator draws a clock with the hands set at the same specific time. Then the patient is asked to copy the image.&lt;ref name ="Jeste"&gt;Jeste DV, Legendre SA, Rice VA, et al (2004). "The clock drawing test as a measure of executive dysfunction in elderly depressed patients." Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology. 17(190)&lt;/ref&gt; Errors in clock drawing are classified according to the following categories: omissions, perseverations, rotations, misplacements, distortions, substitutions and additions.&lt;ref name = "Shulman"/&gt; Memory, concentration, initiation, energy, mental clarity and indecision are all measures that are scored during this activity.&lt;ref name ="Damasio"&gt;Damasio H, Rudrauf D, Tranel D, Vianna E (2008). Does the clock drawing test have focal neuroanatomical correlates? Neuropsychology. 22(5); 553–62&lt;/ref&gt; Those with deficits in executive functioning will often make errors on the first clock but not the second.&lt;ref name = "Shulman"/&gt; In other words, they will be unable to generate their own example, but will show proficiency in the copying task.

=== Stroop task ===
The cognitive mechanism involved in the [[Stroop task]] is referred to as directed attention. The Stroop task requires the participant to engage in and allows assessment of processes such as attention management, speed and accuracy of reading words and colours and of inhibition of competing stimuli.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"&gt;Biederam J, Faraone S, Monutaeux M, et al (2000). Neuropsychological functioning in nonreferred siblings of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder" ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'' 109(2); 252–65&lt;/ref&gt; The stimulus is a colour word that is printed in a different colour than what the written word reads. For example, the word "red" is written in a blue font. One must verbally classify the colour that the word is displayed/printed in, while ignoring the information provided by the written word. In the aforementioned example, this would require the participant to say "blue" when presented with the stimulus. Although the majority of people will show some slowing when given incompatible text versus font colour, this is more severe in individuals with deficits in inhibition. The Stroop task takes advantage of the fact that most humans are so proficient at reading colour words that it is extremely difficult to ignore this information, and instead acknowledge, recognize and say the colour the word is printed in.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod C (1991). Half a century of research on the Stroop effect: An integrative review" ''Psychological Bulletin'' 109(20); 163–203&lt;/ref&gt; The Stroop task is an assessment of attentional vitality and flexibility.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"/&gt; More modern variations of the Stroop task tend to be more difficult and often try to limit the sensitivity of the test.&lt;ref&gt;de Young R (2009)." Stroop task: A test of capacity to direct attention." EPLab: Measures. University of Michigan; http://www.snre.umich.edu/eplab/demos/st0/stroopdesc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wisconsin card sorting test ===
The [[Wisconsin Card Sorting Test]] (WCST) is used to determine an individual's competence in abstract reasoning, and the ability to change problem-solving strategies when needed.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"/&gt; These abilities are primarily determined by the frontal lobes and basal ganglia, which are crucial components of executive functioning;&lt;ref&gt;Andermahr I, Gaser C, Hager F et al (1996). Brain activation during cognitive stimulation with the Wisconsin Card Sorting test—a functional MRI study on healthy volunteers and schizophrenics. Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging. 75(3); 145–57&lt;/ref&gt; making the WCST a good measure for this purpose.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The WCST utilizes a deck of 128 cards that contains four stimulus cards.&lt;ref name ="Biederam"/&gt; The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape. The participants are then given a pile of additional cards and are asked to match each one to one of the previous cards. Typically, children between ages 9 and 11 are able to show the cognitive flexibility that is needed for this test.&lt;ref name="Kirkham"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkham|first=N. Z.|author2=Cruess, L. |author3=Diamond, A. |title=Helping children apply their knowledge to their behavior on a dimension-switching task|journal=Developmental Science|year=2003|volume=6|pages=449–476|doi=10.1111/1467-7687.00300}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chelune|first=G.

=== Trail-making test ===
Another prominent test of executive dysfunction is known as the [[Trail-making test]]. This test is composed of two main parts (Part A &amp; Part B).

Trail making test, Part B as a measure of executive control: validation using a set-switching paradigm.

Trail-making and number-connection tests in the assessment of mental state in portal systemic encephalopathy. Digestive Diseases. 22(6); 541–50&lt;/ref&gt; Set-switching tasks in Part B have low motor and perceptual selection demands, and therefore provide a clearer index of executive function.&lt;ref name ="Arbuthnott"/&gt; Throughout this task, some of the executive function skills that are being measured include impulsivity, visual attention and motor speed.&lt;ref name ="Conn"/&gt;

== In clinical populations ==
The executive system's broad range of functions relies on, and is instrumental in, a broad range of neurocognitive processes. Clinical presentation of severe executive dysfunction that is unrelated to a specific disease or disorder is classified as a [[Dysexecutive Syndrome|dysexecutive syndrome]], and often appears following damage to the [[frontal lobe]]s of the [[cerebral cortex]].&lt;ref name="Chan 2001"&gt;Chan, RC. (2001). Dysexecutive symptoms among a non-clinical sample: a study with the use of the Dysexecutive Questionnaire. British Journal of Psychology, Aug., 92 (pt 3):551–65.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Executive dysfunction is implicated [[etiology|etiologically]] and/or [[co-morbidity|co-morbidly]] in many psychiatric illnesses, which often show the same symptoms as the dysexecutive syndrome. It has been assessed and researched extensively in relation to cognitive developmental disorders, [[psychotic disorders]], [[affective disorders]], and [[conduct disorder]]s, as well as neurodegenerative diseases and [[acquired brain injury]] (ABI).

Environmental dependency syndrome is a dysexecutive syndrome marked by significant behavioural dependence on environmental cues and is marked by excessive imitation and utilization behaviour.&lt;ref name="Lhermitte 1986"&gt;Lhermitte F (1986). Human autonomy and the frontal lobes. Part II: Patient behavior in complex and social situations: the "environmental dependency syndrome" ''Annals of Neurology'' 19(4):335–43.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed in patients with a variety of etiologies including ABI, exposure to phendimetrazine tartrate,&lt;ref name="Hoffmann 2007"&gt;Hoffmann M (2007). Transient environmental dependency syndrome due to phendimetrazine tartrate. Eur Neurol, 58(1):49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; stroke, and various frontal lobe lesions.&lt;ref name="Lhermitte 1986"/&gt;

=== Schizophrenia ===
[[Schizophrenia]] is commonly described as a mental disorder in which a person becomes detached from reality because of disruptions in the pattern of thinking and perception.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; Although the etiology is not completely understood, it is closely related to dopaminergic activity and is strongly associated with both neurocognitive and genetic elements of executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Alfimova 2007"/&gt; Individuals with schizophrenia may demonstrate [[amnesia]] for portions of their [[episodic memory]]. Observed damage to explicit, consciously accessed, memory is generally attributed to the fragmented thoughts that characterize the disorder.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; These fragmented thoughts are suggested to produce a similarly fragmented organization in memory during encoding and storage, making retrieval more difficult. However, [[implicit memory]] is generally preserved in patients with schizophrenia.

Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate spared performance on measures of visual and verbal attention and concentration, as well as on immediate digit span recall, suggesting that observed deficits cannot be attributed to deficits in attention or [[short-term memory]].&lt;ref name ="Oram"&gt;Oram J, Geffen GM, Geffen LB, Kavanaugh DJ &amp; McGrath JJ (2005). Executive control of working memory in schizophrenia" ''Psychiatry Research'' 135, 8190&lt;/ref&gt; However, impaired performance was measured on psychometric measures assumed to assess higher order executive function. Working memory and multi-tasking impairments typically characterize the disorder.&lt;ref name="Abraham 2007"/&gt; Persons with schizophrenia also tend to demonstrate deficits in response inhibition and cognitive flexibility.&lt;ref name ="Thoma &amp; Duam"&gt;Thoma P &amp; Duam I (2008). Working memory and multi-tasking in [[paranoid schizophrenia]] with and without comorbid substance use disorder" ''Addiction'' 103, 774–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients often demonstrate noticeable deficits in the central executive component of working memory as conceptualized by [[Baddeley's model of working memory|Baddeley and Hitch]]. However, performance on tasks associated with the [[phonological loop]] and [[visuospatial sketchpad]] are typically less affected.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Radvasnky"&gt;Radvansky GA (2006). Human Memory. United States of America: Allyn and Bacon&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, patients with schizophrenia show impairment to the central executive component of working memory, specific to tasks in which the visuospatial system is required for central executive control.&lt;ref name ="Oram"/&gt; The phonological system appears to be more generally spared overall.

=== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ===
A triad of core symptoms, namely inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity characterize attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Individuals with [[ADHD]] often experience problems with organization, discipline, and setting priorities, and these difficulties often persist from childhood through adulthood.&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"&gt;Marchetta N, Hurks P, Krabbendam L &amp; Jolles J (2008). Interference control, working memory, concept shifting, and verbal fluency in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Neruopsychology, 22(1), 74–84&lt;/ref&gt; In both children and adults with ADHD, an underlying executive dysfunction involving the prefrontal regions and other interconnected subcortical structures has been found.&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"/&gt; As a result, people with ADHD commonly perform more poorly than matched controls on interference control, mental flexibility and verbal fluency.&lt;ref name ="Barkley 1997"&gt;Barkley RA (1997). Behavioral inhibition, sustained attention, and executive functions: Constructing a unifying theory of ADHD" ''Psychological Bulletin'' 121(1), 65–94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Rosenman"&gt;Rosenman S (2006). Reconsidering the attention deficit paradigm. Australasian Psychiatry, 14(2), 127–32&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a more central impairment in self-regulation is noted in cases of ADHD.&lt;ref name ="Barkley 1997"/&gt; However, some research has suggested the possibility that the severity of executive dysfunction in individuals with ADHD declines with age as they learn to compensate for the aforementioned deficits.&lt;ref name ="Marchetta"/&gt; Thus, a decrease in executive dysfunction in adults with ADHD as compared to children with ADHD is thought reflective of compensatory strategies employed on behalf of the adults (e.g. using schedules to organize tasks) rather than neurological differences.

Although ADHD has typically been conceptualized in a categorical diagnostic paradigm, it has also been proposed that this disorder should be considered within a more dimensional behavioural model that links executive functions to observed deficits.&lt;ref name ="Rosenman"/&gt; Proponents argue that classic conceptions of ADHD falsely localize the problem at perception (input) rather than focusing on the inner processes involved in producing appropriate behaviour (output).&lt;ref name ="Rosenman"/&gt; Moreover, others have theorized that the appropriate development of inhibition (something that is seen to be lacking in individuals with ADHD) is essential for the normal performance of other neuropsychological abilities such as working memory, and emotional self-regulation.&lt;ref name ="Barkley 1997"/&gt; Thus, within this model, deficits in inhibition are conceptualized to be developmental and the result of atypically operating executive systems.

=== Autism spectrum disorder ===
[[Autism]] is diagnosed based on the presence of markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests. It is a disorder that is defined according to behaviour as no specific biological markers are known.&lt;ref name = "Ward"/&gt; Due to the variability in severity and impairment in functioning exhibited by persons with autism, the disorder is typically conceptualized as existing along a continuum (or spectrum) of severity.

Individuals with autism commonly show impairment in three main areas of executive functioning:&lt;ref name ="Barnard"&gt;Barnard L, Muldoon K, Hasan R, O'Brien G &amp; Stewart M (2008). Profiling executive dysfunction in adults with autism and comorbid learning disability. Autism, 12(2), 125–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =" Gilotty"&gt;Gilotty L, Kenworthy L, Sirian L, Black D &amp; Wagner A (2002). Adaptive skills and executive function in autism spectrum disorders. Child Neuropsychology, 8(4), 241–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Firestone and Dozois"&gt;Firestone P &amp; Dozois JA (2007). Abnormal Psychology: Perspectives (3rd edition.). Toronto: Pearson Education Canada Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Hill"&gt;Hill EL (2004). Executive dysfunction in autism. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 8(1), 26–32&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Fluency.''' Fluency refers to the ability to generate novel ideas and responses. Although adult populations are largely underrepresented in this area of research, findings have suggested that children with autism generate fewer novel words and ideas and produce less complex responses than matched controls.
* '''Planning.''' Planning refers to a complex, dynamic process, wherein a sequence of planned actions must be developed, monitored, re-evaluated and updated. Persons with autism demonstrate impairment on tasks requiring planning abilities relative to typically functioning controls, with this impairment maintained over time. As might be suspected, in the case of autism comorbid with learning disability, an additive deficit is observed in many cases.
* '''Flexibility.''' Poor mental flexibility, as demonstrated in individuals with autism, is characterized by perseverative, stereotyped behaviour, and deficits in both the regulation and modulation of motor acts. Some research has suggested that individuals with autism experience a sort of 'stuck-in-set' perseveration that is specific to the disorder, rather than a more global perseveration tendency. These deficits have been exhibited in cross-cultural samples and have been shown to persist over time.

Although there has been some debate, inhibition is generally no longer considered to be an executive function deficit in people with autism.&lt;ref name ="Barnard"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; Individuals with autism have demonstrated differential performance on various tests of inhibition, with results being taken to indicate a general difficulty in the inhibition of a habitual response.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; However, performance on the [[Stroop task]], for example, has been unimpaired relative to matched controls. An alternative explanation has suggested that executive function tests that demonstrate a clear rationale are passed by individuals with autism.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; In this light, it is the design of the measures of inhibition that have been implicated in the observation of impaired performance rather than inhibition being a core deficit.

In general, individuals with autism show relatively spared performance on tasks that do not require [[mentalization]].&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; These include: use of desire and emotion words, sequencing behavioural pictures, and the recognition of basic facial emotional expressions. In contrast, individuals with autism typically demonstrated impaired performance on tasks that do require mentalizing.&lt;ref name ="Ward"/&gt; These include: false beliefs, use of belief and idea words, sequencing [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] pictures, and recognizing complex emotions such as admiring or scheming.

=== Bipolar disorder ===
[[Bipolar disorder]] is a mood disorder that is characterized by both highs (mania) and lows (depression) in mood. These changes in mood sometimes alternate rapidly (changes within days or weeks) and sometimes not so rapidly (within weeks or months).&lt;ref name ="Firestone and Dozois"/&gt; Current research provides strong evidence of cognitive impairments in individuals with bipolar disorder, particularly in executive function and verbal learning.&lt;ref name ="Robinson"&gt;Robinson LJ, Thompson JM, Gallagher P, Goswami U, Young AH, Ferrier IN &amp; Moore PB (2006). A meta-analysis of cognitive deficits in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder" ''Journal of Affective Disorders'' 93, 105–15&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these cognitive deficits appear to be consistent cross-culturally,&lt;ref name ="Robinson"/&gt; indicating that these impairments are characteristic of the disorder and not attributable to differences in cultural values, norms, or practice. Functional neuroimaging studies have implicated abnormalities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex as being volumetrically different in individuals with bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name ="Robinson"/&gt;

Individuals affected by bipolar disorder exhibit deficits in strategic thinking, inhibitory control, working memory, attention, and initiation that are independent of affective state.&lt;ref name ="Firestone and Dozois"/&gt;&lt;ref name =" Glahn"&gt;Glahn DC, Bearden CE, Barguil M, Barrett J, Reichenberg A, Bowden CL, Soars JC &amp; Velligan DI (2007). The neurocognitive signature of psychotic bipolar disorder. Journal of Biology Psychiatry, 62, 910–16&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the more generalized cognitive impairment demonstrated in persons with schizophrenia, for example, deficits in bipolar disorder are typically less severe and more restricted. It has been suggested that a "stable dys-regulation of prefrontal function or the subcortical-frontal circuitry [of the brain] may underlie the cognitive disturbances of bipolar disorder".&lt;ref name ="Dixon"&gt;Dixon T, Kravariti E, Frith C, Murray RM &amp; McGuire PK (2004). Effect of symptoms on executive function in bipolar illness" ''Psychological Medicine'' 34, 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Executive dysfunction in bipolar disorder is suggested to be associated particularly with the manic state, and is largely accounted for in terms of the [[formal thought disorder]] that is a feature of mania.&lt;ref name ="Dixon"/&gt; It is important to note, however, that patients with bipolar disorder with a history of [[psychosis]] demonstrated greater impairment on measures of executive functioning and spatial working memory compared with bipolar patients without a history of psychosis&lt;ref name ="Glahn"/&gt; suggesting that psychotic symptoms are correlated with executive dysfunction.

=== Parkinson's disease ===
[[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) primarily involves damage to subcortical brain structures and is usually associated with movement difficulties, in addition to problems with memory and thought processes.&lt;ref name ="Ward"&gt;Ward J (2006). The Student's Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience. New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; Persons affected by PD often demonstrate difficulties in [[working memory]], a component of executive functioning. Cognitive deficits found in early PD process appear to involve primarily the fronto-executive functions.&lt;ref name ="Schneider"&gt;Schneider JS (2007). Behavioral persistence deficit in Parkinson's disease patients. Journal of Neurology, 14, 300–04&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, studies of the role of dopamine in the cognition of PD patients have suggested that PD patients with inadequate dopamine supplementation are more impaired in their performance on measures of executive functioning.&lt;ref name ="Grossman"&gt;Grossman M, Lee C, Morris J, Stern MB &amp; Hurtig H (2002). Assessing resource demands during sentence processing in Parkinson's disease. Brain and Language, 80, 603–16&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that dopamine may contribute to executive control processes. Increased distractibility, problems in set formation and maintaining and shifting attentional sets, deficits in executive functions such as self-directed planning, problems solving, and working memory have been reported in PD patients.&lt;ref name ="Schneider"/&gt; In terms of working memory specifically, persons with PD show deficits in the areas of: a) spatial working memory; b) [[central executive]] aspects of working memory; c) loss of [[episodic memories]]; d) locating events in time.&lt;ref name = "Ward"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Schneider"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Grossman"/&gt;

'''Spatial working memory.'''
PD patients often demonstrate difficulty in updating changes in spatial information and often become disoriented. They do not keep track of spatial contextual information in the same way that a typical person would do almost automatically. Similarly, they often have trouble remembering the locations of objects that they have recently seen, and thus also have trouble with encoding this information into long-term memory.

'''Central executive aspects.'''
PD is often characterized by a difficulty in regulating and controlling one's stream of thought, and how memories are utilized in guiding future behaviour. Also, persons affected by PD often demonstrate perseverative behaviours such as continuing to pursue a goal after it is completed, or an inability to adopt a new strategy that may be more appropriate in achieving a goal. However, some recent research suggests that PD patients may actually be less persistent in pursuing goals than typical persons and may abandon tasks sooner when they encounter problems of a higher level of difficulty.&lt;ref name ="Schneider"/&gt;

'''Loss of episodic memories.'''
The loss of episodic memories in PD patients typically demonstrates a temporal gradient wherein older memories are generally more preserved than newer memories. Also, while forgetting event content is less compromised in Parkinson's than in [[Alzheimer's]], the opposite is true for event data memories.

'''Locating events in time.'''
PD patients often demonstrate deficits in their ability to sequence information, or date events. Part of the problems is hypothesized to be due to a more fundamental difficulty in coordinating or planning retrieval strategies, rather than failure at the level of encoding or storing information in memory. This deficit is also likely to be due to an underlying difficulty in properly retrieving script information. PD patients often exhibit signs of irrelevant intrusions, incorrect ordering of events, and omission of minor components in their script retrieval, leading to disorganized and inappropriate application of script information.

=== Treatment ===

==== Psychosocial treatment ====
Since 1997 there has been experimental and clinical practice of psychosocial treatment for adults with executive dysfunction, and particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Psychosocial treatment addresses the many facets of executive difficulties, and as the name suggests, covers academic, occupational and social deficits. Psychosocial treatment facilitates marked improvements in major symptoms of executive dysfunction such as time management, organization and self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Ramsay Rostain 2007"&gt;Ramsay JR &amp; Rostain AL (2007). Psychosocial treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in adults: Current status and future directions. Journal of Attention Disorders, 11(6), 624–27&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive-behavioral therapy and group rehabilitation ====
[[Cognitive behavioural therapy|Cognitive-behavioural therapy]] (CBT) is a frequently suggested treatment for executive dysfunction, but has shown limited effectiveness. However, a study of CBT in a group rehabilitation setting showed a significant increase in positive treatment outcome compared with individual therapy. Patients' self-reported symptoms on 16 different ADHD/executive-related items were reduced following the treatment period.&lt;ref name="Virta 2008"&gt;Virta M, Vedenpää A, Grönroos N, Chydenius E, Partinen M, Vataja R, Kaski M, Iivanainen M (2008). Adults with ADHD benefit from cognitive-behaviorally oriented group rehabilitation: a study of 29 participants. Journal of Attention Disorders, 12(3), 218–26&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Treatment for patients with acquired brain injury ====
The use of auditory stimuli has been examined in the treatment of dysexecutive syndrome. The presentation of auditory stimuli causes an interruption in current activity, which appears to aid in preventing "goal neglect" by increasing the patients' ability to monitor time and focus on goals. Given such stimuli, subjects no longer performed below their age group average IQ.&lt;ref name="Manly 2001"&gt;Manly T, Hawkins K, Evans J, Woldt K, Robertson IH (2002). Rehabilitation of executive function: facilitation of effective goal management on complex tasks using periodic auditory alerts" ''Neuropsychologia'' 40(3):271–81&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients with acquired brain injury have also been exposed to goal management training (GMT). GMT skills are associated with paper-and-pencil tasks that are suitable for patients having difficulty setting goals. From these studies there has been support for the effectiveness of GMT and the treatment of executive dysfunction due to ABI.&lt;ref name="Levine 2000"&gt;Levine B, Robertson IH, Clare L, Carter G &amp; Hong J (2000). Rehabilitation of executive functioning: An experimental–clinical validation of Goal Management Training. Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society, 6: 299–312&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developmental context ===
An understanding of how executive dysfunction shapes development has implications how we conceptualize executive functions and their role in shaping the individual. Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette's syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits.&lt;ref name ="De Boechorstraat"&gt;De Boechorstraat V, Geurts H, Oosterlaan J et al (2001). How specific is a deficit of executive functioning for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder? Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.&lt;ref name ="De Boechorstraat"/&gt;

Some research has suggested a link between a child's abilities to gain information about the world around them and having the ability to override emotions in order to behave appropriately.&lt;ref name ="Barchfeld"&gt;Barchfeld P, Kain W, Perner J (2002). Executive control and higher-order theory of mind in children at risk at ADHD. Austria: Department of Psychology, University of Salzburg&lt;/ref&gt; One study required children to perform a task from a series of psychological tests, with their performance used as a measure of executive function.&lt;ref name ="Barchfeld"/&gt; The tests included assessments of: executive functions (self-regulation, monitoring, attention, flexibility in thinking), language, sensorimotor, visuospatial, and learning, in addition to social perception. The findings suggested that the development of [[theory of mind]] in younger children is linked to executive control abilities with development impaired in individuals who exhibit signs of executive dysfunction.&lt;ref name ="Barchfeld"/&gt;

Both ADHD and obesity are complicated disorders and each produces a large impact on an individual's social well being.&lt;ref name ="Dempsey"&gt;Dempsey A, Dyehouse J (2008). The relationship between executive function, AD/HD, and obesity. Western Journal of Nursing Research. 30(8); 1026–27&lt;/ref&gt; This being both a physical and psychological disorder has reinforced that obese individuals with ADHD need more treatment time (with associated costs), and are at a higher risk of developing physical and emotional complications.&lt;ref name ="Dempsey"/&gt; The cognitive ability to develop a comprehensive self-construct and the ability to demonstrate capable emotion regulation is a core deficit observed in people with ADHD and is linked to deficits in executive function.&lt;ref name ="Dempsey"/&gt; Overall, low executive functioning seen in individuals with ADHD has been correlated with tendencies to overeat, as well as with emotional eating.&lt;ref name ="Dempsey"/&gt; This particular interest in the relationship between ADHD and obesity is rarely clinically assessed and may deserve more attention in future research.

It has been made known that young children with behavioral problems show poor verbal ability and executive functions.&lt;ref&gt;Ensor R, Hughes C (2006). Behavioral problems in 2-year-olds: links with individual differences in theory of mind, executive function and harsh parenting" ''Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry'' 47(5); 488–97&lt;/ref&gt; The exact distinction between parenting style and the importance of family structure on child development is still somewhat unclear. However, in infancy and early childhood, parenting is among the most critical external influences on child reactivity.&lt;ref name ="Dennis"&gt;Dennis T (2006). Self-regulation in preschools: the interplay of child approach reactivity, parenting and control capacities" ''Developmental Psychology'' 42(1); 84–97&lt;/ref&gt; In Mahoney's study of maternal communication, results indicated that the way mothers interacted with their children accounted for almost 25% of variability in children's rate of development.&lt;ref name ="Mahoney"&gt;Mahoney GJ (1988). Maternal communication style with mentally retarded children. American Journal of Mental Retardation, 93; 352–59&lt;/ref&gt; Every child is unique, making parenting an emotional challenge that should be most closely related to the child's level of emotional self-regulation (persistence, frustration and compliance).&lt;ref name ="Dennis"/&gt; A promising approach that is currently being investigated amid intellectually disabled children and their parents is responsive teaching. Responsive teaching is an early intervention curriculum designed to address the cognitive, language, and social needs of young children with developmental problems.&lt;ref name ="Herman"&gt;Herman B, Mahoney G, Perales F et al (2006). Responsive teaching: early intervention for children with down syndrome and other disabilities. Down Syndrome Research and Practice&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the principle of "active learning",&lt;ref name ="Herman"/&gt; responsive teaching is a method that is currently being applauded as adaptable for individual caregivers, children and their combined needs&lt;ref name ="Mahoney"/&gt; The effect of parenting styles on the development of children is an important area of research that seems to be forever ongoing and altering. There is no doubt that there is a prominent link between parental interaction and child development but the best child rearing technique continues to vary amongst experts.

=== Evolutionary perspective ===
The prefrontal lobe controls two related executive functioning domains. The first is mediation of abilities involved in planning, problem solving, and understanding information, as well as engaging in working memory processes and controlled attention. In this sense, the prefrontal lobe is involved with dealing with basic, everyday situations, especially those involving metacognitive functions.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"&gt;Ardila A (2008). On the evolutionary origins of executive functions. Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Florida International University&lt;/ref&gt; The second domain involves the ability to fulfill biological needs through the coordination of cognition and emotions which are both associated with the frontal and prefrontal areas.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt;

From an evolutionary perspective, it has been hypothesized that the executive system may have evolved to serve several adaptive purposes.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"&gt;Barkley RA (2001). The executive functions and self-regulation: An evolutionary neuropsychological perspective. Neuropsychology Review, 11(1), 1–29&lt;/ref&gt; The prefrontal lobe in humans has been associated both with metacognitive executive functions and emotional executive functions.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt; Theory and evidence suggest that the frontal lobes in other primates also mediate and regulate emotion, but do not demonstrate the metacognitive abilities that are demonstrated in humans.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt; This uniqueness of the executive system to humans implies that there was also something unique about the environment of ancestral humans, which gave rise to the need for executive functions as adaptations to that environment.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt; Some examples of possible adaptive problems that would have been solved by the evolution of an executive system are: social exchange, imitation and observational learning, enhanced pedagogical understanding, tool construction and use, and effective communication.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt;

In a similar vein, some have argued that the unique metacognitive capabilities demonstrated by humans have arisen out of the development of a sophisticated language (symbolization) systems and culture.&lt;ref name ="Ardila"/&gt; Moreover, in a developmental context, it has been proposed that each executive function capability originated as a form of public behaviour directed at the external environment, but then became self-directed, and then finally, became private to the individual, over the course of the development of self-regulation.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt; These shifts in function illustrate the evolutionarily salient strategy of maximizing longer-term social consequences over near-term ones, through the development of an internal control of behaviour.&lt;ref name ="Barkely 2001"/&gt;

== Socio-cultural implications ==

=== Education ===
In the classroom environment, children with executive dysfunction typically demonstrate skill deficits that can be categorized into two broad domains: a) self-regulatory skills; and b) goal-oriented skills.&lt;ref name="McDougall"&gt;McDougall A (2001). Executive functions: Practical strategies for supporting students. Psychological Services, DDSB. Symposium conducted at DDSB, Ontario, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; The table below is an adaptation of McDougall's&lt;ref name ="McDougall"/&gt; summary and provides an overview of specific executive function deficits that are commonly observed in a classroom environment.

Teachers play a crucial role in the implementation of strategies aimed at improving academic success and classroom functioning in individuals with executive dysfunction. In a classroom environment, the goal of [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] should ultimately be to apply external control, as needed (e.g. adapt the environment to suit the child, provide adult support) in an attempt to modify problem behaviours or supplement skill deficits.&lt;ref name ="Lerner &amp; Kline"&gt;Lerner JW &amp; Kline F (2006). Learning disabilities and related disorders: Characteristics and teaching strategies (10th ed.). United States of America: Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, executive function difficulties should not be attributed to negative personality traits or characteristics (e.g. laziness, lack of motivation, apathy, and stubbornness) as these attributions are neither useful nor accurate.

Several factors should be considered in the development of intervention strategies. These include, but are not limited to: developmental level of the child, comorbid disabilities, environmental changes, motivating factors, and coaching strategies.&lt;ref name ="McDougall"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Lerner &amp; Kline"/&gt; It is also recommended that strategies should take a proactive approach in managing behaviour or skill deficits (when possible), rather than adopt a reactive approach.&lt;ref name ="McDougall"/&gt; For example, an awareness of where a student may have difficulty throughout the course of the day can aid the teacher in planning to avoid these situations or in planning to accommodate the needs of the student.

People with executive dysfunction have a slower cognitive processing speed and thus often take longer to complete tasks than people who demonstrate typical executive function capabilities. This can be frustrating for the individual and can serve to impede academic progress. Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette's syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt;

Moreover, some people with ADHD report experiencing frequent feelings of drowsiness.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown TE (2008). Describing Six Aspects of a Complex Syndrome. http://www.drthomasebrown.com/pdfs/Executive_Functions_by_Thomas_Brown.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This can hinder their attention for lectures, readings, and completing assignments. Individuals with this disorder have also been found to require more stimuli for information processing in reading and writing.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; Slow processing may manifest in behavior as signaling a lack of motivation on behalf of the learner. However, slow processing is reflective of an impairment of the ability to coordinate and integrate multiple skills and information sources.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The main concern with individuals with autism regarding learning is in the imitation of skills.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; This can be a barrier in many aspects such as learning about others intentions, mental states, speech, language, and general social skills.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; Individuals with autism tend to be dependent on the routines that they have already mastered, and have difficulty with initiating new non-routine tasks. Although an estimated 25–40% of people with autism also have a learning disability, many will demonstrate an impressive rote memory and memory for factual knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Hill"/&gt; As such, repetition is the primary and most successful method for instruction when teaching people with autism.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

Being attentive and focused for people with Tourette's syndrome is a difficult process. People affected by this disorder tend to be easily distracted and act very impulsively.&lt;ref name ="Gaffney"/&gt; That is why it is very important to have a quiet setting with few distractions for the ultimate learning environment. Focusing is particularly difficult for those who are affected by Tourette's syndrome comorbid with other disorders such as ADHD or [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], it makes focusing very difficult.&lt;ref name="Gaffney"&gt;Gaffney GR (2005). Tourette Syndrome. University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics. http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/neurologicalhealth/tourettesyndrome.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329091227/http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/neurologicalhealth/tourettesyndrome.html |date=2009-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, these individuals can be found to repeat words or phrases consistently either immediately after they are learned or after a delayed period of time.&lt;ref name ="Gaffney"/&gt;

=== Criminal behaviour ===

The Spanish Journal of Psychology, 259–65&lt;/ref&gt; The prefrontal cortex is involved with mental functions including; affective range of emotions, forethought, and self-control.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt; Moreover, there is a scarcity of mental control displayed by individuals with a dysfunction in this area over their behavior, reduced flexibility and self-control and their difficulty to conceive behavioral consequences, which may conclude in unstable (or criminal) behavior.&lt;ref name ="Barbosa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ogilvie|first=James M.|last2=Stewart|first2=Anna L.|last3=Chan|first3=Raymond C.

Statistically significant relations have been discerned between anti-social behavior and executive function deficits.&lt;ref name ="Lilenfeld"/&gt; These findings relate to the emotional instability that is connected with executive function as a detrimental symptom that can also be linked towards criminal behavior. Conversely, it is unclear as to the specificity of anti-social behavior to executive function deficits as opposed to other generalized neuropsychological deficits.&lt;ref name ="Lilenfeld"&gt;Lilenfeld S, Morgan A (2000).

Furthermore, some think the dysfunction cannot be entirely to blame.&lt;ref name ="Brower"/&gt; There are interacting environmental factors that also have an influence on the likelihood of criminal action. This theory proposes that individuals with this deficit are less able to control impulses or foresee the consequences of actions that seem attractive at the time (see above) and are also typically provoked by environmental factors. One must recognize that the frustrations of life, combined with a limited ability to control life events, can easily cause aggression and/or other criminal activities. Early brain Damage causes dopamine(epigentically) to select for "Seeking" behavior in the very short term...this is the window for existence for these individuals...the future has no meaning so consequences have no meaning

&lt;!-- The image is consistent with what the powerplant itself (http://www.gres2.kz/index.php?view=3&amp;in=gallery&amp;id=15#) claims to be the GRES-2 stack --&gt;]]
A '''flue-gas stack''' is a type of [[chimney]], a vertical pipe, channel or similar structure through which combustion product gases called [[flue gas]]es are exhausted to the outside air. Flue gases are produced when coal, oil, natural gas, wood or any other fuel is [[combustion|combusted]] in an industrial furnace, a [[power station|power plant's]] steam-generating boiler, or other large combustion device. Flue gas is usually composed of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water vapor as well as [[nitrogen]] and excess [[oxygen]] remaining from the intake combustion air. It also contains a small percentage of pollutants such as [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]] and [[sulfur oxides]]. The flue gas stacks are often quite tall, up to 400 metres (1300&amp;nbsp;feet) or more, so as to disperse the exhaust pollutants over a greater area and thereby reduce the [[concentration]] of the pollutants to the levels required by governmental environmental policy and environmental regulation.

When the flue gases are exhausted from stoves, ovens, fireplaces, or other small sources within residential abodes, restaurants, hotels, or other public buildings and small commercial enterprises, their flue gas stacks are referred to as chimneys.

==History==

The first industrial chimneys were built in the mid-17th century when it was first understood how they could improve the combustion of a furnace by increasing the [[Stack effect#The flow induced by the stack effect|draft]] of air into the combustion zone.&lt;ref&gt;Douet, James (1988). ''Going up in Smoke:The History of the Industrial Chimney'', Victorian Society, London, England.  [http://www.victoriansociety.org.uk/caserpts.html Victorian Society Casework Reports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925221950/http://www.victoriansociety.org.uk/caserpts.html |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they played an important part in the development of [[reverberatory furnace]]s and a coal-based metallurgical industry, one of the key sectors of the early [[Industrial Revolution]]. Most 18th-century industrial chimneys (now commonly referred to as '''flue gas stacks''') were built into the walls of the furnace much like a domestic chimney. The first free-standing industrial chimneys were probably those erected at the end of the long condensing [[flue]]s associated with smelting [[lead]].

The powerful association between industrial chimneys and the characteristic smoke-filled landscapes of the industrial revolution was due to the universal application of the [[steam engine]] for most manufacturing processes. The chimney is part of a steam-generating boiler, and its evolution is closely linked to increases in the power of the steam engine. The chimneys of [[Thomas Newcomen]]’s steam engine were incorporated into the walls of the engine house. The taller, free-standing industrial chimneys that appeared in the early 19th century were related to the changes in boiler design associated with [[James Watt]]’s "double-powered" engines, and they continued to grow in stature throughout the Victorian period. Decorative embellishments are a feature of many industrial chimneys  from the 1860s, with over-sailing caps and patterned brickwork.

The invention of fan-assisted forced draft in the early 20th century removed the industrial chimney's original function, that of drawing air into the steam-generating boilers or other furnaces. With the replacement of the steam engine as a prime mover, first by diesel engines and then by electric motors, the  early industrial chimneys began to disappear from the industrial landscape. Building materials changed from stone and brick to steel and later reinforced concrete, and the height of the industrial chimney was determined by the need to disperse combustion flue gases to comply with governmental [[air pollution]] control regulations.

==Flue-gas stack draft==
[[Image:Chimney effect.svg|thumb|180px|right|The stack effect in chimneys: the gauges represent absolute air pressure and the airflow is indicated with light grey arrows. The gauge dials move clockwise with increasing pressure.]]
{{main|Stack effect}}

The combustion flue gases inside the flue gas stacks are much hotter than the ambient outside air and therefore less dense than the ambient air. That causes the bottom of the vertical column of hot flue gas to have a lower pressure than the pressure at the bottom of a corresponding column of outside air. That higher pressure outside the chimney is the driving force that moves the required combustion air into the combustion zone and also moves the flue gas up and out of the chimney.  That movement or flow of combustion air and flue gas is called "natural draft", [[HVAC#Natural ventilation|"natural ventilation"]], "chimney effect", or "[[stack effect]]". The taller the stack, the more draft is created.

The equation below provides an approximation of the pressure difference, Δ''P'', (between the bottom and the top of the flue gas stack) that is created by the draft:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect02.htm Natural Ventilation Lecture 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512181617/http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect02.htm |date=2006-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Perry, R.H.  |author2=Green, Don W.|title=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook|edition=6th Edition (page 9-72)|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company|year=1984|isbn=0-07-049479-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta P =Cah\bigg(\frac {1}{T_o} - \frac {1}{T_i}\bigg)&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* Δ''P'': available pressure difference, in [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]
* ''C'' = 0.0342
* ''a'': atmospheric pressure, in Pa
* ''h'': height of the flue gas stack, in m
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'': absolute outside air temperature, in [[kelvin|K]]
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'': absolute average temperature of the flue gas inside the stack, in K.

The above equation is an approximation because it assumes that the [[molar mass]] of the flue gas and the outside air are equal and that the pressure drop through the flue gas stack is quite small.  Both assumptions are fairly good but not exactly accurate.

== Flue-gas flow-rate induced by the draft==

As a "first guess" approximation, the following equation can be used to estimate the flue-gas flow-rate induced by the draft of a flue-gas stack. The equation assumes that the molar mass of the flue gas and the outside air are equal and that the [[friction|frictional resistance]] and heat losses are negligible:.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect03.htm Natural Ventilation Lecture 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702065714/http://www.arch.hku.hk/teaching/lectures/airvent/sect03.htm |date=2006-07-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q = CA\sqrt {2gH\frac{T_i - T_o}{T_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''Q'': flue-gas flow-rate, m³/s  
* ''A'': cross-sectional area of chimney, m² (assuming it has a constant cross-section)  
* ''C'' : discharge coefficient (usually taken to be 0.65–0.70)
* ''g'': [[standard gravity|gravitational acceleration at sea level]] = 9.807&amp;nbsp;m/s² 
* ''H'' : height of chimney, m 
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : absolute average temperature of the flue gas in the stack, [[kelvin|K]]
* ''T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' : absolute outside air temperature, K

Also, this equation is only valid when the resistance to the draft flow is caused by a single orifice characterized by the discharge coefficient C. In many, if not most situations, the resistance is primarily imposed by the flue stack itself. In these cases, the resistance is proportional to the stack height H. This causes a cancellation of the H in the above equation predicting Q to be invariant with respect to the flue height.

Designing chimneys and stacks to provide the correct amount of natural draft involves a great many factors such as:

* The height and diameter of the stack.
* The desired amount of excess combustion air needed to assure complete combustion.
* The temperature of the flue gases leaving the combustion zone.
* The composition of the combustion flue gas, which determines the flue-gas density.
* The frictional resistance to the flow of the flue gases through the chimney or stack, which will vary with the materials used to construct the chimney or stack.
* The heat loss from the flue gases as they flow through the chimney or stack.
* The local atmospheric pressure of the ambient air, which is determined by the local elevation above sea level.

The calculation of many of the above design factors requires trial-and-error reiterative methods.

Government agencies in most countries have specific codes which govern how such design calculations must be performed. Many non-governmental organizations also have codes governing the design of chimneys and stacks (notably, the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] codes).

==Stack design==
The design of large stacks poses considerable engineering challenges.  [[Vortex shedding]] in high winds can cause dangerous [[oscillations]] in the stack, and may lead to its collapse.  The use of helical faring is common to prevent this process occurring at or close to the [[resonant frequency]] of the stack.

==Other items of interest==

Some fuel-burning industrial equipment does not rely upon natural draft.  Many such equipment items use large fans or blowers to accomplish the same objectives, namely: the flow of combustion air into the combustion chamber and the flow of the hot flue gas out of the chimney or stack.

A great many power plants are equipped with facilities for the removal of [[sulfur dioxide]] (i.e., [[flue-gas desulfurization]]), [[nitrogen oxides]] (i.e., [[selective catalytic reduction]], [[exhaust gas recirculation]], thermal deNOx, or low NOx burners) and particulate matter (i.e., [[electrostatic precipitator]])s. At such power plants, it is possible to use a [[cooling tower]] as a flue gas stack. Examples can be seen in Germany at the [[Power Station Staudinger Grosskrotzenburg]] and at the [[Rostock Power Station]]. Power plants without flue gas purification, would experience serious corrosion in such stacks.

In the United States and a number of other countries, [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; studies are required to determine the flue gas stack height needed to comply with the local [[air pollution]] regulations. The United States also limits the maximum height of a flue gas stack to what is known as the "Good Engineering Practice (GEP)" stack height.&lt;ref&gt;''Guideline for Determination of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height (Technical Support Document for the Stack Height Regulations), Revised'' (1985), EPA Publication No. EPA–450/4–80–023R, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 85–225241)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Jr., R.E. and W.H. Snyder (1983). ''Determination of Good Engineering Practice Stack Height: A Demonstration Study for a Power Plant'', EPA Publication No. EPA–600/3–83–024. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (NTIS No. PB 83–207407)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of existing flue gas stacks that exceed the GEP stack height, any air pollution dispersion modelling studies for such stacks must use the GEP stack height rather than the actual stack height.

'''Geomorphology''' (from [[Ancient Greek]]: [[wikt:γῆ|γῆ]], ''gê'', "earth"; [[wikt:μορφή|μορφή]], ''morphḗ'', "form"; and λόγος, ''[[Logos|lógos]]'', "study") is the scientific study of the origin and evolution of [[topography|topographic]] and [[bathymetry|bathymetric]] features created by physical, chemical or biological processes operating at or near the Earth's surface. Geomorphologists seek to understand why [[landscape]]s look the way they do, to understand [[landform]] history and dynamics and to predict changes through a combination of field observations, physical experiments and [[landscape evolution model|numerical modeling]]. Geomorphologists work within disciplines such as [[physical geography]], [[geology]], [[geodesy]], [[engineering geology]], [[archaeology]], [[climatology]] and [[geotechnical engineering]]. This broad base of interests contributes to many research styles and interests within the field.

== Overview ==
[[File:VU0K1843 (39985550).jpg|thumbnail|[[Weathering#Ocean waves|Waves]] and [[Water chemistry analysis|water chemistry]] lead to structural failure in exposed rocks]]
[[Earth]]'s surface is modified by a combination of surface processes that shape landscapes, and geologic processes that cause [[tectonic uplift]] and [[subsidence]], and shape the [[coastal geography]]. Surface processes comprise the action of [[water]], [[wind]], [[ice]], [[wildfire|fire]], and living things on the surface of the Earth, along with chemical reactions that form [[soil]]s and alter material properties, the stability and rate of change of [[topography]] under the force of [[gravity]], and other factors, such as (in the very recent past) human alteration of the landscape. Many of these factors are strongly mediated by [[climate]]. Geologic processes include the uplift of [[mountain range]]s, the growth of [[volcano]]es, [[isostasy|isostatic]] changes in land surface elevation (sometimes in response to surface processes), and the formation of deep [[sedimentary basin]]s where the surface of the Earth drops and is filled with material [[erosion|eroded]] from other parts of the landscape.  The Earth's surface and its topography therefore are an intersection of climatic, [[hydrology|hydrologic]], and [[biology|biologic]] action with geologic processes, or alternatively stated, the intersection of the Earth's [[lithosphere]] with its [[hydrosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and [[biosphere]].

The broad-scale topographies of the Earth illustrate this intersection of surface and subsurface action. Mountain belts are [[tectonic uplift|uplifted]] due to geologic processes. [[Denudation]] of these high uplifted regions produces [[sediment]] that is transported and [[deposition (geology)|deposited]] elsewhere within the landscape or off the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willett|first=Sean D.|author2=Brandon, Mark T.|title=On steady states in mountain belts|journal=Geology|date=January 2002|volume=30|issue=2|pages=175–178|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(2002)030&lt;0175:OSSIMB&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 2002Geo....30..175W}}&lt;/ref&gt; On progressively smaller scales, similar ideas apply, where individual landforms evolve in response to the balance of additive processes (uplift and deposition) and subtractive processes ([[subsidence]] and [[erosion]]). Often, these processes directly affect each other: ice sheets, water, and sediment are all loads that change topography through [[flexural isostasy]]. Topography can modify the local climate, for example through [[orographic precipitation]], which in turn modifies the topography by changing the hydrologic regime in which it evolves. Many geomorphologists are particularly interested in the potential for [[Climate change feedback|feedbacks]] between climate and [[erosion and tectonics|tectonics]], mediated by geomorphic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roe|first=Gerard H.|author2=Whipple, Kelin X. |author3=Fletcher, Jennifer K. |title=Feedbacks among climate, erosion, and tectonics in a critical wedge orogen|journal=American Journal of Science|date=September 2008|volume=308|issue=7|pages=815–842|doi=10.2475/07.2008.01|url=http://earthweb.ess.washington.edu/roe/Publications/RoeEtal_ClimateWedge_08.pdf|bibcode=2008AmJS..308..815R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these broad-scale questions, geomorphologists address issues that are more specific and/or more local. Glacial geomorphologists investigate glacial deposits such as [[moraine]]s, [[esker]]s, and proglacial [[lake]]s, as well as [[Erosion#Ice|glacial erosional]] features, to build chronologies of both small [[glacier]]s and large [[ice sheet]]s and understand their motions and effects upon the landscape. [[Fluvial]] geomorphologists focus on [[river]]s, how they [[sediment transport|transport sediment]], [[River channel migration|migrate across the landscape]], [[bedrock river|cut into bedrock]], respond to environmental and tectonic changes, and interact with humans. Soils geomorphologists investigate soil profiles and chemistry to learn about the history of a particular landscape and understand how climate, biota, and rock interact. Other geomorphologists study how [[hill]]slopes form and change. Still others investigate the relationships between [[ecology]] and geomorphology. Because geomorphology is defined to comprise everything related to the surface of the Earth and its modification, it is a broad field with many facets.

Geomorphologists use a wide range of techniques in their work. These may include fieldwork and field data collection, the interpretation of remotely sensed data, geochemical analyses, and the numerical modelling of the physics of landscapes. Geomorphologists may rely on [[geochronology]], using dating methods to measure the rate of changes to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Summerfield, M.A., 1991, Global Geomorphology, Pearson Education Ltd, 537 p. {{ISBN|0-582-30156-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunai, T.J., 2010, Cosmogenic Nucleides, Cambridge University Press, 187 p. {{ISBN|978-0-521-87380-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Terrain measurement techniques are vital to quantitatively describe the form of the Earth's surface, and include [[differential GPS]], remotely sensed [[digital terrain model]]s and [[Lidar#Geology and soil science|laser scanning]], to quantify, study, and to generate illustrations and maps.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., [http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/terrain/intro.html DTM intro page], Hunter College Department of Geography, New York NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical applications of geomorphology include [[natural hazard|hazard]] assessment (such as [[landslide]] prediction and [[Landslide mitigation|mitigation]]), river control and [[stream restoration]], and coastal protection.  Planetary geomorphology studies landforms on other terrestrial planets such as Mars.   Indications of effects of [[aeolian processes|wind]], [[fluvial]], [[glacial]], [[mass wasting]], [[Impact event|meteor impact]], [[tectonics]] and [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic]] processes are studied. This effort not only helps better understand the geologic and atmospheric history of those planets but also extends geomorphological study of the Earth. Planetary geomorphologists often use [[Terrestrial Analogue Sites|Earth analogue]]s to aid in their study of surfaces of other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Conference of Geomorphology|url=http://www.geomorphology-iag-paris2013.com/en/s3-%E2%80%93-planetary-geomorphology-iag-wg|publisher=Europa Organization|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317082407/http://www.geomorphology-iag-paris2013.com/en/s3-%E2%80%93-planetary-geomorphology-iag-wg|archivedate=2013-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than some notable exceptions in antiquity, geomorphology is a relatively young science, growing along with interest in other aspects of the [[earth sciences]] in the mid-19th century.  This section provides a very brief outline of some of the major figures and events in its development.

===Ancient geomorphology===

The study of landforms and the evolution of the Earth's surface can be dated back to scholars of [[Classical Greece]]. [[Herodotus]] argued from observations of soils that the [[Nile delta]] was actively growing into the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and estimated its age.&lt;ref name='Bierman'&gt;Bierman, Paul R., and David R. Montgomery. Key concepts in geomorphology. Macmillan Higher Education, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] speculated that due to [[sediment transport]] into the sea, eventually those seas would fill while the land lowered. He claimed that this would mean that land and water would eventually swap places, whereupon the process would begin again in an endless cycle.&lt;ref name='Bierman' /&gt;

Another early theory of geomorphology was devised by the polymath [[History of China|Chinese]] scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095 AD). This was based on his observation of [[Ocean|marine]] [[fossil]] shells in a [[stratum|geological stratum]] of a mountain hundreds of miles from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Noticing [[bivalvia|bivalve]] shells running in a horizontal span along the cut section of a cliffside, he theorized that the cliff was once the pre-historic location of a seashore that had shifted hundreds of miles over the centuries. He inferred that the land was reshaped and formed by [[soil erosion]] of the mountains and by deposition of [[silt]], after observing strange natural erosions of the [[Taihang Mountains]] and the [[Yandangshan|Yandang Mountain]] near [[Wenzhou]].&lt;ref&gt;Sivin, Nathan (1995). ''Science in Ancient China: Researches and Reflections''. Brookfield, Vermont: VARIORUM, Ashgate Publishing. III, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nj&gt;Needham, Joseph. (1959). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. pp. 603–618.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, he promoted the theory of gradual [[climate change]] over centuries of time once ancient petrified [[bamboo]]s were found to be preserved underground in the dry, northern climate zone of ''Yanzhou'', which is now modern day [[Yan'an]], [[Shaanxi]] province.&lt;ref name=nj/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Alan Kam-leung and Gregory K. Clancey, Hui-Chieh Loy (2002). ''Historical Perspectives on East Asian Science, Technology and Medicine''. Singapore: [[Singapore University Press]]. p. 15. {{ISBN|9971-69-259-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern geomorphology===
The term geomorphology seems to have been first used by [[Laumann]] in an 1858 work written in German. Keith Tinkler has suggested that the word came into general use in English, German and French after [[John Wesley Powell]] and [[W. J. McGee]] used it during the International Geological Conference of 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Tinkler, Keith J. A short history of geomorphology. Page 4. 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Edward Marr]] in his The Scientific Study of Scenery&lt;ref&gt;Marr, J.E. The Scientific Study of Scenery. Methuen, page iii, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; considered his book as, 'an Introductory Treatise on Geomorphology, a subject which has sprung from the union of Geology and Geography'.

An early popular geomorphic model was the ''geographical cycle'' or ''[[cycle of erosion]]'' model of broad-scale landscape evolution developed by [[William Morris Davis]] between 1884 and 1899.&lt;ref name='Bierman' /&gt; It was an elaboration of the [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]] theory that had first been proposed by [[James Hutton]] (1726–1797).&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes'&gt;Oldroyd, David R. &amp; Grapes, Rodney H. Contributions to the history of geomorphology and Quaternary geology: an introduction. In: GRAPES, R. H., OLDROYD, D. &amp; GRIGELIS, A. (eds) History of Geomorphology and Quaternary Geology. Geological Society, London, Special Publications, 301, 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[valley]] forms, for example, uniformitarianism posited a sequence in which a river runs through a flat terrain, gradually carving an increasingly deep valley, until the [[side valley]]s eventually erode, flattening the terrain again, though at a lower elevation. It was thought that [[tectonic uplift]] could then start the cycle over. In the decades following Davis's development of this idea, many of those studying geomorphology sought to fit their findings into this framework, known today as "Davisian".&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes' /&gt; Davis's ideas are of historical importance, but have been largely superseded today, mainly due to their lack of predictive power and qualitative nature.&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes' /&gt;

In the 1920s, [[Walther Penck]] developed an alternative model to Davis's.&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes' /&gt; Penck thought that landform evolution was better described as an alternation between ongoing processes of uplift and denudation, as opposed to Davis's model of a single uplift followed by decay.&lt;ref name='Ritter'&gt;Ritter, Dale F., R. Craig Kochel, and Jerry R. Miller. Process geomorphology. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; He also emphasised that in many landscapes slope evolution occurs by backwearing of rocks, not by Davisian-style surface lowering, and his science tended to emphasise surface process over understanding in detail the surface history of a given locality. Penck was German, and during his lifetime his ideas were at times rejected vigorously by the English-speaking geomorphology community.&lt;ref name=OldroydGrapes /&gt; His early death, Davis' dislike for his work, and his at-times-confusing writing style likely all contributed to this rejection.&lt;ref name='Simons'&gt;Simons, Martin (1962), "The morphological analysis of landforms: A new review of the work of Walther Penck (1888–1923)", Transactions and Papers (Institute of British Geographers) 31: 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Davis and Penck were trying to place the study of the evolution of the Earth's surface on a more generalized, globally relevant footing than it had been previously. In the early 19th century, authors – especially in Europe – had tended to attribute the form of landscapes to local [[climate]], and in particular to the specific effects of [[glaciation]] and [[periglacial]] processes. In contrast, both Davis and Penck were seeking to emphasize the importance of evolution of landscapes through time and the generality of the Earth's surface processes across different landscapes under different conditions.

During the early 1900s, the study of regional-scale geomorphology was termed "physiography".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Physiography later was considered to be a contraction of "'''''physi'''''cal" and "ge'''''ography'''''", and therefore synonymous with [[physical geography]], and the concept became embroiled in controversy surrounding the appropriate concerns of that discipline. Some geomorphologists held to a geological basis for physiography and emphasized a concept of [[physiographic regions of the world|physiographic regions]] while a conflicting trend among geographers was to equate physiography with "pure morphology", separated from its geological heritage.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} In the period following World War II, the emergence of process, climatic, and quantitative studies led to a preference by many earth scientists for the term "geomorphology" in order to suggest an analytical approach to landscapes rather than a descriptive one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Victor R. | authorlink = |title=Geomorphology From Space: A Global Overview of Regional Landforms, Introduction |publisher=NASA |date=1986 |url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/geomorphology/GEO_1/GEO_CHAPTER_1.shtml |accessdate=2007-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climatic geomorphology===
{{further|Climatic geomorphology}}
During the age of [[New Imperialism]] in the late 19th century European explorers and scientists traveled across the globe bringing descriptions of landscapes and landforms. As geographical knowledge increased over time these observations were systematized in a search for regional patterns. Climate emerged thus as prime factor for explaining landform distribution at a grand scale. The rise of climatic geomorphology was foreshadowed by the work of [[Wladimir Köppen]], [[Vasily Dokuchaev]] and [[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|Andreas Schimper]]. [[William Morris Davis]], the leading geomorphologist of his time, recognized the role of climate by complementing his "normal" temperate climate [[cycle of erosion]] with arid and glacial ones.&lt;ref name=TwidaleLageat1994&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Twidale |first1=C.R.|author-link=Charles Rowland Twidale |last2=Lageat |first2=Y. |date=1994 |title=Climatic geomorphology: a critique |url= |journal=[[Progress in Physical Geography]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=319–334 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goudie2004&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Goudie|first=A.S.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|author-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Climatic geomorphology|year=2004|pages=162–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, interest in climatic geomorphology was also a reaction ''against'' [[Cycle of erosion|Davisian geomorphology]] that was by the mid-20th century considered both un-innovative and dubious.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Attack&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flemal |first=Ronald C. |last2= |first2= |date=1971 |title=The Attack on the Davisian System Of Geomorphology: A Synopsis |url= |journal= Journal of Geological Education|volume= 19|issue= |pages=3–13 |doi= 10.5408/0022-1368-XIX.1.3|access-date= |bibcode=1971JGeoE..19....3F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early climatic geomorphology developed primarily in [[continental Europe]] while in the English-speaking world the tendency was not explicit until L.C. Peltier's 1950 publication on a [[periglaciation|periglacial]] cycle of erosion.&lt;ref name=TwidaleLageat1994/&gt;

Climatic geomorphology was criticized in a 1969 [[review article]] by [[process geomorphology|process geomorphologist]] D.R. Stoddart.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas2004&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Thomas|first=Michael F.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer)|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|title=Tropical geomorphology|year=2004|pages=1063–1069}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism by Stoddart proved "devastating" sparking a decline in the popularity of climatic geomorphology in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomas2004/&gt; Stoddart criticized climatic geomorphology for applying supposedly "trivial" methodologies in establishing landform differences between morphoclimatic zones, being linked to [[Cycle of erosion|Davisian geomorphology]] and by allegedly neglecting the fact that physical laws governing processes are the same across the globe.&lt;ref name=Thomas2004/&gt; In addition some conceptions of climatic geomorphology, like that which holds that chemical weathering is more rapid in tropical climates than in cold climates proved to not be straightforwardly true.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;

===Quantitative and process geomorphology===
[[File:South Africa-Mpumalanga-Gods Window002.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]] in the [[Drakensberg]], southern Africa. This landscape, with its high altitude [[plateau]] being incised into by the steep slopes of the escarpment, was cited by Davis as a classic example of his [[cycle of erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kevin, and Yanni Gunnell.

Geological Society of America Memoirs 201 (2008): 1–66.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Geomorphology was started to be put on a solid quantitative footing in the middle of the 20th century. Following the early work of [[Grove Karl Gilbert]] around the turn of the 20th century,&lt;ref name='Bierman' /&gt;&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Ritter' /&gt; a group of mainly American natural scientists, [[geologists]] and [[hydraulic engineers]] including [[William Walden Rubey]], [[Ralph Alger Bagnold]], [[Hans Albert Einstein]], [[Frank Ahnert]], [[John Tilton Hack|John Hack]], [[Luna Leopold]], [[Shields parameter|A. Shields]], [[Thomas Maddock (scientist)|Thomas Maddock]], [[Arthur Strahler]], [[Stanley Schumm]], and [[Ronald Shreve]] began to research the form of landscape elements such as [[rivers]] and [[mass wasting|hillslopes]] by taking systematic, direct, quantitative measurements of aspects of them and investigating the [[Scaling law|scaling]] of these measurements.&lt;ref name='Bierman' /&gt;&lt;ref name='OldroydGrapes' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Ritter' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ftp://rock.geosociety.org/pub/Memorials/v41/Schumm-S.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}. These methods began to allow prediction of the past and future behavior of landscapes from present observations, and were later to develop into the modern trend of a highly quantitative approach to geomorphic problems. Many groundbreaking and widely cited early geomorphology studies appeared in the [[Bulletin of the Geological Society of America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MORISAWA|first=MARIE|date=1988-07-01|title=The Geological Society of America Bulletin and the development of quantitative geomorphology|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsabulletin/article-abstract/100/7/1016/182157/the-geological-society-of-america-bulletin-and-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=GSA Bulletin|language=en|volume=100|issue=7|pages=1016|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1988)100&lt;1016:TGSOAB&gt;2.3.CO;2|issn=0016-7606|bibcode=1988GSAB..100.1016M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received only few citations prior to 2000 (they are examples of [[Paper with delayed recognition|"sleeping beauties"]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Evan B|date=2017-04-17|title=Delayed recognition of geomorphology papers in the Geological Society of America Bulletin|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0309133317703093|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=363–368|doi=10.1177/0309133317703093}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a marked increase in quantitative geomorphology research occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Church|first=Michael|date=2010-06-01|title=The trajectory of geomorphology|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0309133310363992|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|language=en|volume=34|issue=3|pages=265–286|doi=10.1177/0309133310363992|issn=0309-1333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative geomorphology can involve [[fluid dynamics]] and [[solid mechanics]], [[geomorphometry]], laboratory studies, field measurements, theoretical work, and full [[landscape evolution model]]ing. These approaches are used to understand [[weathering]] and [[pedogenesis|the formation of soils]], [[sediment transport]], landscape change, and the interactions between climate, tectonics, erosion, and deposition.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In Sweden [[Filip Hjulström]]'s doctoral thesis, "The River Fyris" (1935), contained one of the first quantitative studies of geomorphological processes ever published. His students followed in the same vein, making quantitative studies of mass transport ([[Anders Rapp]]), fluvial transport ([[Åke Sundborg]]), delta deposition ([[Valter Axelsson]]), and coastal processes ([[John O. Norrman]]). This developed into "the [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] School of [[Physical Geography]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, KJ, 1985: "The Nature of Physical Geography", E. Arnold&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary geomorphology===
Today, the field of geomorphology encompasses a very wide range of different approaches and interests.&lt;ref name='Bierman' /&gt; Modern researchers aim to draw out quantitative "laws" that govern Earth surface processes, but equally, recognize the uniqueness of each landscape and environment in which these processes operate. Particularly important realizations in contemporary geomorphology include:

1) that not all landscapes can be considered as either "stable" or "perturbed", where this perturbed state is a temporary displacement away from some ideal target form.  Instead, dynamic changes of the landscape are now seen as an essential part of their nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whipple |first=Kelin X. |title=Bedrock Rivers and the Geomorphology of Active Orogens |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |date=19 May 2004 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=151–185 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.32.101802.120356 |bibcode = 2004AREPS..32..151W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time scales"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allen |first=Philip A. |title=Time scales of tectonic landscapes and their sediment routing systems |journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications |date=2008 |volume=296 |pages=7–28 |doi=10.1144/SP296.2 |bibcode = 2008GSLSP.296....7A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2) that many geomorphic systems are best understood in terms of the [[stochastic process|stochasticity]] of the processes occurring in them, that is, the probability distributions of event magnitudes and return times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Benda |first=Lee |author2=[[Thomas Dunne (geologist)|Dunne, Thomas]] |title=Stochastic forcing of sediment supply to channel networks from landsliding and debris flow |journal=Water Resources Research |date=December 1997 |volume=33 |issue=12 |pages=2849–2863 |doi=10.1029/97WR02388 |bibcode=1997WRR....33.2849B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knighton, David. Fluvial forms and processes: a new perspective. Routledge, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn has indicated the importance of [[chaos theory|chaotic determinism]] to landscapes, and that landscape properties are best considered [[statistics|statistically]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dietrich |first=W.

Albeit having its importance diminished [[climatic geomorphology]] continues to exist as field of study producing relevant research. More recently concerns over [[global warming]] have led to a renewed interest in the field.&lt;ref name=Goudie2004/&gt;

Despite considerable criticism the [[cycle of erosion]] model has remained part of the science of geomorphology.&lt;ref name=Slaymaker/&gt; The model or theory has never been proved wrong,&lt;ref name=Slaymaker/&gt; but neither has it been proven.&lt;ref name=ARoy&gt;{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Andre |date= |title=Contemporary Meanings in Physical Geography: From What to Why? |url= |location= |publisher= |page=5 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inherent difficulties of the model have instead made geomorphological research to advance along other lines.&lt;ref name=Slaymaker&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Slaymaker|first=Olav|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |title=Geomorphic evolution|year=2004|pages=420–422}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to its disputed status in geomorphology, the cycle of erosion model is a common approach used to establish [[denudation chronology|denudation chronologies]], and is thus an important concept in the science of [[historical geology]].&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Jones|first=David K.C.|editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S.|editor-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |title=Denudation chronology|year=2004|pages=244–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; While acknowledging its shortcomings modern geomorphologists [[Andrew Goudie (geographer)|Andrew Goudie]] and [[Karna Lidmar-Bergström]] have praised it for its elegance and pedagogical value respectively.&lt;ref name=Naten&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/erosionscykel |title=erosionscykel |last=Lidmar-Bergström |first=Karna |author-link=Karna Lidmar-Bergström |date= |website=[[Nationalencyklopedin]] |publisher=Cydonia Development |access-date=June 22, 2016 |quote= |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goudie&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Goudie|first=A.S.|author-link=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |editor-last=Goudie|editor-first=A.S. |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology |title=Cycle of erosion|year=2004|pages=223–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geomorphically relevant processes generally fall into
(1) the production of [[regolith]] by [[weathering]] and [[erosion]], 
(2) the [[sediment transport|transport]] of that material, and 
(3) its eventual [[deposition (geology)|deposition]]. Primary surface processes responsible for most topographic features include [[wind]], [[wave]]s, [[weathering|chemical dissolution]], [[mass wasting]], [[groundwater]] movement, [[surface water]] flow, [[glacier|glacial action]], [[tectonism]], and [[volcanism]]. Other more exotic geomorphic processes might include [[periglacial]] (freeze-thaw) processes, salt-mediated action, marine currents activity, seepage of fluids through the seafloor or extraterrestrial impact.

=== Aeolian processes ===
[[File:MoabAlcove.JPG|thumb|Wind-eroded alcove near [[Moab, Utah]]]]
[[Aeolian processes]] pertain to the activity of the [[wind]]s and more specifically, to the winds' ability to shape the surface of the [[Earth]]. Winds may erode, transport, and deposit materials, and are effective agents in regions with sparse [[vegetation]] and a large supply of fine, unconsolidated [[sediment]]s. Although water and mass flow tend to mobilize more material than wind in most environments, aeolian processes are important in arid environments such as [[desert]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Leeder, M., 1999, Sedimentology and Sedimentary Basins, From Turbulence to Tectonics, Blackwell Science, 592 p. {{ISBN|0-632-04976-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological processes===
[[File:Beaver dam in Tierra del Fuego.jpg|thumb|[[Beaver eradication in Tierra del Fuego|Beaver dams]], as this one in [[Tierra del Fuego]], constitute a specific form of zoogeomorphology, a type of biogeomorphology.]]
The interaction of living organisms with landforms, or [[Biogeomorphology|biogeomorphologic processes]], can be of many different forms, and is probably of profound importance for the terrestrial geomorphic system as a whole.  Biology can influence very many geomorphic processes, ranging from [[biogeochemical]] processes controlling [[chemical weathering]], to the influence of mechanical processes like [[burrowing]] and [[tree throw]] on soil development, to even controlling global erosion rates through modulation of climate through carbon dioxide balance. Terrestrial landscapes in which the role of biology in mediating surface processes can be definitively excluded are extremely rare, but may hold important information for understanding the geomorphology of other planets, such as [[Geography of Mars|Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dietrich |first=William E. |author2=Perron, J.

[[File:Eroding Mesas Forming Seif and Barchan Dunes in Hellespontus region.jpg|thumb|[[Seif dune|Seif]] and [[barchan]] dunes in the [[Noachis quadrangle|Hellespontus]] region on the surface of [[Mars]]. Dunes are mobile landforms created by the transport of large volumes of sand by wind.]]
{{Main|Fluvial}}
{{See also|Hack's law|Sediment transport}}
Rivers and streams are not only conduits of water, but also of [[sediment]]. The water, as it flows over the channel bed, is able to mobilize sediment and transport it downstream, either as [[bed load]], [[suspended load]] or [[dissolved load]]. The rate of sediment transport depends on the availability of sediment itself and on the river's [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]].&lt;ref&gt;Knighton, D., 1998, ''Fluvial Forms &amp; Processes'', Hodder Arnold, 383 p. {{ISBN|0-340-66313-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers are also capable of eroding into rock and creating new sediment, both from their own beds and also by coupling to the surrounding hillslopes. In this way, rivers are thought of as setting the base level for large-scale landscape evolution in nonglacial environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Strahler |first=A. N. |title=Equilibrium theory of erosional slopes approached by frequency distribution analysis; Part II |journal=American Journal of Science |date=1 November 1950 |volume=248 |issue=11 |pages=800–814 |doi=10.2475/ajs.248.11.800|bibcode=1950AmJS..248..800S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burbank |first=D. W. |title=Rates of erosion and their implications for exhumation |journal=Mineralogical Magazine |date=February 2002 |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=25–52 |doi=10.1180/0026461026610014 |url=http://projects.crustal.ucsb.edu/tectgeomorphfigs/Min_Mag_exhumation_ms.pdf |format=PDF|bibcode=2002MinM...66...25B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers are key links in the connectivity of different landscape elements.

As rivers flow across the landscape, they generally increase in size, merging with other rivers. The network of rivers thus formed is a [[drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage system]]. These systems take on four general patterns: dendritic, radial, rectangular, and trellis. Dendritic happens to be the most common, occurring when the underlying stratum is stable (without faulting). Drainage systems have four primary components: drainage basin, alluvial valley, delta plain, and receiving basin. Some geomorphic examples of fluvial landforms are [[alluvial fan]]s, [[oxbow lake]]s, and [[fluvial terrace]]s.

=== Glacial processes===
[[File:Glacial landscape LMB.png|thumb|right|Features of a glacial landscape]]
[[Glacier]]s, while geographically restricted, are effective agents of landscape change. The gradual movement of [[ice]] down a valley causes [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]] and [[Plucking (glaciation)|plucking]] of the underlying [[rock (geology)|rock]]. Abrasion produces fine sediment, termed [[glacial flour]]. The debris transported by the glacier, when the glacier recedes, is termed a [[moraine]]. Glacial erosion is responsible for U-shaped valleys, as opposed to the V-shaped valleys of fluvial origin.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, M.R. &amp; Glasser, N.F., 1996, Glacial Geology: Ice Sheets and Landforms, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, 364 p. {{ISBN|0-471-96345-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The way glacial processes interact with other landscape elements, particularly hillslope and fluvial processes, is an important aspect of [[Plio-Pleistocene]] landscape evolution and its sedimentary record in many high mountain environments. Environments that have been relatively recently glaciated but are no longer may still show elevated landscape change rates compared to those that have never been glaciated. Nonglacial geomorphic processes which nevertheless have been conditioned by past glaciation are termed [[paraglacial]] processes. This concept contrasts with [[periglacial]] processes, which are directly driven by formation or melting of ice or frost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Church |first=Michael |author2=Ryder, June M. |title=Paraglacial Sedimentation: A Consideration of Fluvial Processes Conditioned by Glaciation |journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin |date=October 1972 |volume=83 |issue=10 |pages=3059–3072 |doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1972)83[3059:PSACOF]2.0.CO;2 |bibcode = 1972GSAB...83.3059C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hillslope processes ===
[[File:TalusConesIsfjorden.jpg|thumb|[[Talus cone]]s on the north shore of [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]], [[Svalbard]], Norway. Talus cones are accumulations of coarse hillslope debris at the foot of the slopes producing the material.]]
[[Image:Ferguson-slide.jpg|thumb|The [[Ferguson landslide|Ferguson Slide]] is an active [[landslide]] in the [[Merced River|Merced River canyon]] on [[California State Highway 140]], a primary access road to [[Yosemite National Park]].]]
[[Soil]], [[regolith]], and [[rock (geology)|rock]] move downslope under the force of [[gravity]] via [[Downhill creep|creep]], [[Landslide|slides]], flows, topples, and falls. Such [[mass wasting]] occurs on both terrestrial and submarine slopes, and has been observed on [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Venus]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]].

Ongoing hillslope processes can change the topology of the hillslope surface, which in turn can change the rates of those processes. Hillslopes that steepen up to certain critical thresholds are capable of shedding extremely large volumes of material very quickly, making hillslope processes an extremely important element of landscapes in tectonically active areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roering |first=Joshua J. |author2=Kirchner, James W. |author3=Dietrich, William E.  |title=Evidence for nonlinear, diffusive sediment transport on hillslopes and implications for landscape morphology |journal=Water Resources Research |date=March 1999 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=853–870 |doi=10.1029/1998WR900090 |url=http://www.geog.uoregon.edu/amarcus/geog607w09/readings/roering-et-al1999_wrr_slopes.pdf |format=PDF |bibcode=1999WRR....35..853R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Earth, biological processes such as [[burrowing]] or [[tree throw]] may play important roles in setting the rates of some hillslope processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gabet |first=Emmanuel J. |author2=Reichman, O.J. |author3=Seabloom, Eric W.  |title=The Effects of Bioturbation on Soil Processes and Sediment Transport |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |date=May 2003 |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=249–273 |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.31.100901.141314|bibcode= 2003AREPS..31..249G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Igneous processes===
Both [[volcanic]] (eruptive) and [[plutonic]] (intrusive) igneous processes can have important impacts on geomorphology. The action of volcanoes tends to rejuvenize landscapes, covering the old land surface with [[lava]] and [[tephra]], releasing [[pyroclastic flow|pyroclastic]] material and forcing rivers through new paths.  The cones built by eruptions also build substantial new topography, which can be acted upon by other surface processes. Plutonic rocks intruding then solidifying at depth can cause both uplift or subsidence of the surface, depending on whether the new material is denser or less dense than the rock it displaces.

===Tectonic processes===
{{See also|Erosion and tectonics}}
[[Plate tectonics|Tectonic]] effects on geomorphology can range from scales of millions of years to minutes or less. The effects of tectonics on landscape are heavily dependent on the nature of the underlying [[bedrock]] fabric that more or less controls what kind of local morphology tectonics can shape. [[Earthquake]]s can, in terms of minutes, submerge large areas of land creating new wetlands. [[Isostatic rebound]] can account for significant changes over hundreds to thousands of years, and allows erosion of a mountain belt to promote further erosion as mass is removed from the chain and the belt uplifts. Long-term plate tectonic dynamics give rise to [[orogeny|orogenic belts]], large mountain chains with typical lifetimes of many tens of millions of years, which form focal points for high rates of fluvial and hillslope processes and thus long-term sediment production.

Features of deeper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] dynamics such as [[mantle plume|plumes]] and [[delamination (geology)|delamination]] of the lower lithosphere have also been hypothesised to play important roles in the long term (&gt; million year), large scale (thousands of km) evolution of the Earth's topography (see [[dynamic topography]]).  Both can promote surface uplift through isostasy as hotter, less dense, mantle rocks displace cooler, denser, mantle rocks at depth in the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cserepes |first=L. |author2=Christensen, U.R. |author3=Ribe, N.M.  |title=Geoid height versus topography for a plume model of the Hawaiian swell |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |date=15 May 2000 |volume=178 |issue=1–2 |pages=29–38 |doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(00)00065-0 |bibcode=2000E&amp;PSL.178...29C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seber |first=Dogan |author2=Barazangi, Muawia |author3=Ibenbrahim, Aomar |author4= Demnati, Ahmed  |title=Geophysical evidence for lithospheric delamination beneath the Alboran Sea and Rif–Betic mountains |journal=Nature |date=29 February 1996 |volume=379 |issue=6568 |pages=785–790 |doi=10.1038/379785a0 |bibcode = 1996Natur.379..785S |url=http://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/5287/1/Seber1996_Abstract%26Figure.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine processes===
Marine processes are those associated with the action of waves, marine currents and seepage of fluids through the seafloor. [[Mass wasting]] and submarine [[landslide|landsliding]] are also important processes for some aspects of marine geomorphology.&lt;ref&gt;Guilcher, A., 1958. Coastal and submarine morphology. Methuen.&lt;/ref&gt; Because ocean basins are the ultimate sinks for a large fraction of terrestrial sediments, depositional processes and their related forms (e.g., sediment fans, [[deltas]]) are particularly important as elements of marine geomorphology.

== Scales ==
Different geomorphological processes dominate at different spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, scales on which processes occur may determine the reactivity or otherwise of landscapes to changes in driving forces such as climate or tectonics.&lt;ref name="Time scales"/&gt; These ideas are key to the study of geomorphology today.

To help categorize landscape scales some geomorphologists might use the following [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]:
* 1st – [[Continent]], [[ocean basin]], climatic zone (~10,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 2nd – Shield, e.g. [[Baltic Shield]], or [[mountain range]] (~1,000,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 3rd – Isolated [[sea]], [[Sahel]] (~100,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 4th – [[Massif]], e.g. [[Massif Central]] or Group of related landforms, e.g., [[Weald]] (~10,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 5th – River valley, [[Cotswolds]] (~1,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 6th – Individual [[mountain]] or [[volcano]], small valleys (~100&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 7th – Hillslopes, stream channels, [[estuary]] (~10&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 8th – [[gully]], [[barchannel]] (~1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
* 9th – Meter-sized features

== Overlap with other fields ==
There is a considerable overlap between geomorphology and other fields. Deposition of material is extremely important in [[sedimentology]].  [[Weathering]] is the chemical and physical disruption of earth materials in place on exposure to atmospheric or near surface agents, and is typically studied by [[soil science|soil scientists]] and environmental [[chemistry|chemists]], but is an essential component of geomorphology because it is what provides the material that can be moved in the first place. [[Civil engineering|Civil]] and [[Environmental engineering|environmental]] engineers are concerned with erosion and sediment transport, especially related to [[canal]]s, [[slope stability]] (and [[natural hazard]]s), [[water quality]], coastal environmental management, transport of contaminants, and [[stream restoration]]. Glaciers can cause extensive erosion and deposition in a short period of time, making them extremely important entities in the high latitudes and meaning that they set the conditions in the headwaters of mountain-born streams; [[glaciology]] therefore is important in geomorphology.

Mar '''Ignatius Dionysius Ephrem II Rahmani''' (21 November 1848 &amp;ndash; 7 May 1929) was [[Patriarch]] of the [[Syriac Catholic Church]] from 1898 to 1929 and a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] scholar.

==Life==
Ephrem Rahmani was born on 21 November 1848&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/brahm.html|title=Archbishop Ignacio Dionisio Efrem Rahmani (Rahamani)|publisher=Catholic-Hierarchy|accessdate=2009-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or on 9 November 1849 according to other sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syriaccatholic.org/Rahmany.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193148/http://www.syriaccatholic.org/Rahmany.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-03-03|title=البطريرك أغناطيوس أفرام الثاني رحماني|accessdate=2009-03-01}} &lt;/ref&gt;) in [[Mosul]]. He studied by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars in Mosul and later in the [[College of the Propaganda]] in [[Rome]] and was ordained priest in April 1873. 

Rahmani was appointed vicar of the bishop of Mosul with the [[Titular see|titular]] title of bishop of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] and consecrated bishop on 2 October 1887 by Patriarch [[Ignatius George V Shelhot]]. On 1 May 1894 Rahmani was appointed bishop of [[Aleppo]]. After the death of [[Ignatius Behnam II Benni]] (13 September 1897) he was elected Patriarch on 9 October 1898 and confirmed by [[Pope Leo XIII]] on 28 November 1898.

As patriarch Rahmani was particularly interested in the instruction of the clergy. The early 20th-century was a period of expansion for the [[Syriac Catholic Church]] who received many [[Syrian Orhtodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] converts.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book|pages=75–76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9g6BTkcwXWMC&amp;pg=PA84#PPA75,M1|title=The Rites of Eastern Christendom|isbn=978-1-59333-391-1|first=Archdale |last=King|origyear=1947/8|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} he moved the [[Episcopal See|Patriarchal See]] from [[Mardin]] to [[Beirut]].

With the [[World War I]] arrived the catastrophe: the [[Armenian Genocide]] brought destruction also to the Christian Syrians who lived in the same areas of the Armenians, and the Syriac Catholic Church had the number of its members cut by half&lt;ref name="Frazee"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frazee| first=Charles A. |title=Catholics and Sultans: The Church and the Ottoman Empire 1453&amp;ndash;1923 |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-02700-7 |pages=295 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6DM4szwUpEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA295,M1 |accessdate=2009-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with five dioceses (on ten) and fifteen missions destroyed.

Ephrem Rahmani died in [[Cairo]] on 7 May 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/anti1.htm|title=Patriarchal See of Antioch|publisher=GCatholic.org|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Ephrem Rahmani was a liturgical scholar of international repute.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt; In 1899 he discovered and published the first edition of the 4th-century text ''[[Testamentum Domini]]''. His main contribution on the history of the liturgy is his book ''Les Liturgies Orientales et Occidentales'', Beyrouth, 1929

'''The Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED)''' is one of the ten [[research]] institutes of the Faculty of Science of the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]]. IBED employs more than 100 researchers, with PhD students and Postdocs forming a majority, and 30 supporting staff. The total annual budget is around 10 m€, of which more than 40 per cent comes from external grants and contracts.  The main output consist of publications in peer reviewed journals and books (on average 220 per year). Each year around 15 PhD students defend their thesis and obtain their degree from the Universiteit van Amsterdam. The institute is managed by a general director appointed by the Dean of the Faculty for a period of five years, assisted by a business manager.

==Mission statement==

The mission of the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics is to increase our insights in the functioning and [[biodiversity]] of [[ecosystems]] in all their complexity. Knowledge of the interactions between living [[organisms]] and processes in their physical and chemical environment is essential for a better understanding of the dynamics of ecosystems at different temporal and spatial scales.

==Organization of IBED Research==

IBED research is organized in the following three themes:

===Theme I: Biodiversity and Evolution===
The main question of Theme I research is how patterns in biodiversity can be explained from underlying processes: [[speciation]] and [[extinction]], dispersal and the (dis)appearance of [[geographical]] barriers, [[reproductive isolation]] and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]] of taxa. Modern reconstructions of the history of life on earth rely heavily on analyses of [[DNA]] data that contain the footprints of the past. Research related to human-made effects on biodiversity includes the identification of endangered biodiversity hotspots affected by global change, potential risks of an escape of transgenes from crops to wild [[species]], and the consequences of [[habitat fragmentation]] for the viability and [[genetic diversity]] of [[populations]] and species.

===Theme II: Geo-ecology===
Research in Theme II concentrates on the physical and [[chemical]] properties of [[Environment (biophysical)|the environment]], and how these affect the [[living organisms]] in an [[ecosystem]]. The spatial and temporal scale ranges from fluxes at the [[molecular]] level to the reconstruction of [[Quaternary]] [[climate change]] in different continents. Research related to human effects on ecosystems includes the fate of chemical [[pollutants]] in the system, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestering, [[nutrient]] fluxes and [[soil fertility]] and the effects of [[land use]] on [[erosion]] and [[desertification]].

===Theme III: Community Dynamics===
Research in Theme III aims to understand the dynamics of natural communities given the diversity and behaviour of the organisms present in the system. Individual variation - for instance in [[Prenatal development (biology)|developmental stage]] or in [[Genetics|genetic]] response - can have a major impact on the stability of complex [[biological systems]]. The research of Theme III has many applications: control of [[Pest (organism)|pests]] and [[Plague (disease)|plagues]], prevention of toxic [[algal blooms]], managing fish populations by harvesting and restocking, and control of [[turbidity]] in [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] systems.

==Organization of IBED Education==
IBED is closely involved in several [[BSc]] and [[MSc]] programmes of the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]]. Especially the MSc programmes that are taught in English are highly integrated within the research of IBED.

==Notable staff==

'''Leopold Blaschka''' (27 May 1822 – 3 July 1895) and his son '''Rudolf Blaschka''' (17 June 1857 – 1 May 1939) were [[Dresden, Germany]] glass artists native to the Bohemian (Czech)–German borderland, known for the production of biological models such as the [[glass sea creatures]] and  Harvard University's [[Glass Flowers]].

==Born to glass==
The Blaschka family traces its roots to [[Josefův Důl (Jablonec nad Nisou District)|Josefuv Dul]] (Antoniwald) in the Iser or [[Izera Mountains]], a region known for processing glass, metals and gems&lt;ref name="urania"/&gt; and members of the family had worked in [[Venice]],&lt;ref name="designmuseum" /&gt; [[Bohemia]], and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Sigwart, Julia D. "Crystal creatures: context for the Dublin Blaschka Congress." Historical Biology 20.1 (2008): 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvell, Drew 2016"&gt;Harvell, Drew, and Greene, Harry W. A Sea of Glass: Searching for the Blaschkas&amp;Apos; Fragile Legacy in an Ocean at Risk Organisms and Environments 13. University Of California Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
Leopold referred to this history in an 1889 letter to [[Mary Lee Ware]]:
{{blockquote|Many people think that we have some secret apparatus by which we can squeeze glass suddenly into these forms, but it is not so. We have tact. My son Rudolf has more than I have, because he is my son, and tact increases in every generation. The only way to become a glass modeler of skill, I have often said to people, is to get a good great-grandfather who loved glass; then he is to have a son with like tastes; he is to be your grandfather. He in turn will have a son who must, as your father, be passionately fond of glass. You, as his son, can then try your hand, and it is your own fault if you do not succeed. But, if you do not have such ancestors, it is not your fault. My grandfather was the most widely known glassworker in Bohemia.&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vitreous tract" /&gt;}}

Born in [[Český Dub]], [[Bohemia]], and one of [[Joseph Blaschke]]'s three sons,&lt;ref name="Harvell, Drew 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="heraldica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.cz/ghmags/2010/ghmag_2010_1-2_article-6.pdf|title=Heraldika a genealogie č. 1 - 2/2010|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold, alone of his brothers, displayed the necessary artistic skills as a child, and was apprenticed to a [[goldsmith]] and [[gemcutter]] in [[Turnov]], a town in the [[Liberec Region]] of today's Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="heraldica"/&gt; He then joined the family business, which produced glass ornaments and [[glass eye]]s.&lt;ref name="designmuseum" /&gt; He developed a technique which he termed "glass-spinning", which permitted the construction of highly precise and detailed works in glass. He also [[Latinised]] his family name to "Blaschka", and began to focus the business on the manufacture of glass eyes.&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt;

Leopold married Caroline Zimmermann in 1846 and within four years their son Josef Augustin Blaschka was born.&lt;ref name="heraldica"/&gt;
Caroline and Josef died of cholera in a 1850, and a year later his father died. Heartbroken, Leopold "sought consolation in the natural world, sketching the plants in the countryside around his home."&lt;ref&gt;The Story of Rudolf and Leopold Blaschka - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHOx5H5vNx4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heraldica"/&gt;

==Glass marine invertebrates==
{{main|Glass sea creatures}}
[[File:Blaschka 4.jpg|thumb|right|Blaschka model of jellyfish]]
In 1853, Leopold traveled to the United States. En route the ship was delayed at sea for two weeks by lack of wind.&lt;ref name="cmog invertebrates" /&gt; During this time Leopold studied and sketched local [[marine invertebrate]], intrigued by the glass-like transparency of their bodies.&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt; He wrote:
{{blockquote|It is a beautiful night in May. Hopefully, we look out over the darkness of the sea, which is as smooth as a mirror; there emerges all around in various places a flashlike bundle of light beams, as if it is surrounded by thousands of sparks, that form true bundles of fire and of other bright lighting spots, and the seemingly mirrored stars. There emerges close before us a small spot in a sharp greenish light, which becomes ever larger and larger and finally becomes a bright shining sunlike figure.&lt;ref name="cmog invertebrates" /&gt;}}

On return to [[Dresden]], Leopold focused on his family business. In 1854 he married Caroline Riegel&lt;ref name="heraldica"/&gt; - producing glass eyes, costume ornaments, lab equipment, and other such fancy goods and specialty items that only a master [[Lampworking|lampworker]] could accomplish.&lt;ref name="harvard herbaria" /&gt; However, like anyone, he did have free time, and his hobby was to make glass models of plants – as opposed to invertebrates. This would, many years later, become a base for the fabled ''Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants'' (otherwise known as the [[Glass Flowers]]), but, for the moment, such artistry was naught but an amusing and profitless pastime done between his various commissions.&lt;ref name="harvard herbaria"/&gt; Yet, unsurprisingly, given their stunning quality, this amusing hobby – itself born out of seeking consolation in nature upon his first wife's death – attracted attention. Aristocratic attention, as it turned out, specifically the eyes of Prince Camille de [[House of Rohan|Rohan]] who arranged to meet with Leopold at [[Sychrov Castle]] in  1857 - the same year that the Leopold &amp; Caroline's son Rudolf was born.&lt;ref name="heraldica"/&gt; Being something of a naturalist himself, the Prince commissioned Leopold to craft 100 glass [[orchid]]s for his private collection &lt;ref name="designmuseum" /&gt; and, being more than a little impressed by the mastery Leopold's work, in 1862, "the prince exhibited about 100 models of orchids and other exotic plants, which he displayed on two artificial tree trunks in his palace in Prague,"&lt;ref name="cmog invertebrates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="heraldica"/&gt; a fateful act which brought the skill of the Blaschkas to the attention of another - man whom the Prince had actually once introduced to Leopold: a certain Professor [[Ludwig Reichenbach]].&lt;ref name="sciencefriday" /&gt;

[[File:Blaschka 1.jpg|thumb|right|Blaschka model of sea anemones]]

The director of the natural history museum in Dresden, Prof. Reichenbach, was enchanted by the botanical models and positive that Leopold held the key to ending his own inability to properly showcase marine invertebrates, for in the 19th century the only practiced method of showcasing them was to take a live specimen and place it in a sealed jar of alcohol.&lt;ref name="cmog archive" /&gt; This of course killed it but, more importantly, time and their lack of hard parts eventually rendered them into little more than colorless floating blobs of jelly. Neither pretty nor a terribly effective teaching tool, the Dresden museum director desired something more, specifically 3D colored models of marine invertebrates that were both lifelike and able to stand the test of time&lt;ref name="harvard herbaria"/&gt; and thus, in 1863&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt; Reichenbach convinced and commissioned Leopold to produce twelve model [[sea anemone]]s.&lt;ref name="designmuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencefriday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="berlin" /&gt; These marine models, hailed as "an artistic marvel in the field of science and a scientific marvel in the field of art,"&lt;ref name="wales" /&gt; were a great improvement on previous methods of presenting such creatures: drawings, pressing, photographs and [[papier-mâché]] or wax models.&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt;

Knowing this and thrilled with his newly acquired set of glass sea creatures, Reichenbach advised Leopold to drop his current and generations long family business of glass fancy goods and the like in favor of selling glass marine invertebrates to museums, aquaria, universities, and private collectors&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt;&lt;ref name="designmuseum" /&gt; - advice which prompted the swiftly and highly lucrative mail-order business that followed. Indeed, "the world had never seen anything quite like the beautiful, scientifically accurate Blaschka models"&lt;ref name="atlasobscura" /&gt; and yet they were available via so common a means as via mail-order per one's local card catalog. Not glorious, perhaps, but highly effective, and museums and universities began purchasing them en masse to put on display much as Prof. Reichenbach had - for natural history museum directors the world over had the same marine invertebrate showcasing problem.&lt;ref name="cmog invertebrates"/&gt; In short, Blaschkas Glass sea creature mail-order enterprise succeeded for two reasons: 1- there was a huge and global demand; 2- they were the only and best glass artists capable of crafting literally scientifically flawless models. Initially the designs for these were based on drawings in books, but Leopold was soon able to use his earlier drawings to produce highly detailed models of other species,&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt; and his reputation quickly spread; the task additionally furthering the training of his son and apprentice (and eventual successor), Rudolf Blaschka.&lt;ref name="designmuseum" /&gt; Indeed, a year after the success of the glass sea anemones, the family moved to family moved to [[Dresden]] to give young Rudolf better educational opportunities.&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt;

== Belgium ==

In 1886, [[Edouard Van Beneden]], founder of the Institute of Zoology, ordered 77 Blaschka models in order to illustrate zoology lessons. Some of these models are still on display at TréZOOr, in the Aquarium-Muséum in [[Liège]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aquarium-museum.uliege.be/en/a-decouvrir/museum/trezoor/ TréZOOr Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contact with Harvard==
[[File:GlassFlowers1HMNH.jpg|thumb|left|Part of the Harvard Glass Flowers collection]]
In about 1880, Rudolf began assisting his father with the models. In that year, they produced 131 Glass sea creature models for the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] Society of Natural History Museum (now the [[Museum of Science (Boston)|Museum of Science]]). These models, along with the ones purchased by [[Harvard University|Harvard's]] [[Museum of Comparative Zoology]], were seen by Professor [[George Lincoln Goodale]], who was in the process of setting up the [[Harvard Botanical Museum]]. In 1886 the Blaschkas were approached by Goodale, who had come to Dresden for the sole purpose of finding them, with a request to make a series of glass botanical models for Harvard; some reports claim that Goodale saw a few glass orchids in the room where they met, surviving from the work two decades earlier.&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt; Leopold was unwilling as his current business of selling Glass sea creatures was hugely successful but, eventually, the famed glass artists agreed to send test-models to the U.S. and, although badly damaged by U.S. [[Customs]],&lt;ref name="cmog flowers" /&gt; Goodale nonetheless appreciated the fragmentary craftwork and showed them widely – convinced that Blaschka glass art was a more than worthy educational investment. His reasons for wanting the models was simple: At that time, Harvard was the global center of botanical study. As such, Goodale wanted the best, but the only used method was showcasing pressed and carefully labeled specimens — a methodology that offered a twofold problem: being pressed, the specimens were two-dimensional and tended to lose their color. Hence they were hardly the ideal teaching tools.&lt;ref name="harvard flowers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="goodale" /&gt; However, having already seen Harvard's recently procured glass marine invertebrates, Professor Goodale - like Professor Reichenbach before him - realized that glass flowers would solve his problem&lt;ref name="goodale" /&gt; – for, as glass, they were three-dimensional and would retain their color.

[[File:Glass Flowers gift-bouquet.jpg|thumb|right|A photo of the bouquet of glass flowers which, in 1889, Leopold Blaschka made and gifted to Elizabeth C. and Mary L. Ware which, at some later date, was given to Harvard and is now part of the Glass Flowers exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi-Wilcox, Susan M. "A Brief History of Harvard's Glass Flowers Collection and Its Development." Journal of Glass Studies (2015): 197-211.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Investments require funds, and to cover the expensive enterprise Goodale approached his former student [[Mary Lee Ware]] and her mother [[Elizabeth Cabot (Lee) Ware|Elizabeth C. Ware]]; they were independently wealthy and already liberal benefactors of Harvard's botanical department.&lt;ref name="wiley" /&gt; Mary convinced her mother to agree to underwrite the consignment of the uncannily lifelike models that enchanted them both.&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt; In 1887 the Blaschkas contracted to spend half-time producing the models for Harvard.&lt;ref name="emison"/&gt; They continued to spend their remaining time making marine invertebrate models. However, in 1890 the Blaschkas insisted that it was impossible to craft the botanical models for half the year and the sea creatures the other half; "they said that they must give up either one or the other."&lt;ref name="iiif.lib.harvard.edu"&gt;Annual reports of the President and Treasurer of Harvard College 1890-1891, pp. 160-163 - https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:427018526$1i&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, that same year the Blaschkas signed an exclusive ten-year contract with Harvard to make [[Glass Flowers|glass flowers]] for 8,800 marks per year.&lt;ref name="emison" /&gt; New arrangements were also made to send the models directly to Harvard, where museum staff could open them safely, observed by Customs staff.&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt; They modeled a great range of plants (finally, 164 taxonomic families) and plant parts (flowers, leaves, fruits, roots). Some were shown during [[pollination]] by insects, others diseased in various ways.&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt; Prof. Goodale noted that the activity of the Blaschkas was "greatly increased by their exclusive devotion to a single a single line of work."&lt;ref name="iiif.lib.harvard.edu"&gt;Annual reports of the President and Treasurer of Harvard College 1890-1891, pp. 160-163 - https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:427018526$1i&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to Leopold's feelings for the Glass Flowers enterprise, and the change to it from the successful marine creature business, Goodale wrote the following in the ''Annual reports of the President and Treasurer of Harvard College 1890-1891'':
{{blockquote|It has been only within a comparatively short time that I have discovered the cause of the great reluctance of the elder Blaschka to the undertaking at the outset. It appears upon inquiry that he had constructed a few models of plants before beginning the preparation of the animal models to which he owes his wide celebrity; but these models of plants were, he thought, not appreciated by the persons for whom he had made them. The first set of models passed through various vicissitudes, and finally found a home in the Natural History Museum in [[Liege]], where they were at last destroyed by fire. The artist did not have courage to undertake the experiment again, when he was succeeding so well with his animal models. He regards it as a pleasant turn in his fortunes which permits him to devote all of his time to the subject of his earliest studies.&lt;ref name="iiif.lib.harvard.edu"&gt;Annual reports of the President and Treasurer of Harvard College 1890-1891, pp. 160-163 - https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:427018526$1i&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Production of the Glass Flowers==
Early in the making of the Glass Flowers, Mary Lee Ware engaged in correspondence with Professor Goodale regarding the making of the collection, one of which contained a remark of Leopold's regarding the false rumor that secret methods were used in the making of the Glass Flowers: ''"Many people think that we have some secret apparatus by which we can squeeze glass suddenly into these forms, but it is not so. We have tact. My son Rudolf has more than I have, because he is my son, and tact increases in every generation."''&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vitreous tract" /&gt; On this trend, he also once said that ''"One cannot hurry glass. It will take its own time. If we try to hasten it beyond its limits, it resists and no longer obeys us. We have to humor it."''&lt;ref&gt;Blaschka Plants Blend Science and Artistry (NYT) - https://www.nytimes.com/1976/03/08/archives/new-jersey-pages-blaschka-plants-blend-science-and-artistry.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blaschkas used a mixture of clear and coloured glass, sometimes supported with wire, to produce their models.&lt;ref name="emison" /&gt; Many pieces were painted, this work being entirely given to Rudolf.&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt; In order to represent plants which were not native to the Dresden area, the two studied the exotic plant collections at [[Pillnitz Palace]]&lt;ref name="emison" /&gt; and the [[Botanischer Garten der Technischen Universität Dresden|Dresden Botanical Garden]], and also grew some from seed sent from the United States.&lt;ref name="emison" /&gt; In 1892, Rudolf was sent on a trip to the [[Caribbean]] and the U.S. to study additional plants, making extensive drawings and notes.&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt; At this point the number of glass models sent annually to Harvard was approximately 120.&lt;ref name="iiif.lib.harvard.edu"&gt;Annual reports of the President and Treasurer of Harvard College 1890-1891, pp. 160-163 - https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:427018526$1i&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GlassFlowers4HMNH.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|A section of the Glass Flowers exhibit]]

Rudolf made a second trip to the U.S. in 1895. While he was overseas - and eleven years into the project - Leopold died.&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt; Rudolf continued to work alone, slowing down production so as to achieve higher levels of botanical perfection.&lt;ref name="popular science" /&gt; By the early twentieth century, he found that he was unable to buy glass of suitably high quality, and so started making his own.&lt;ref name="emison" /&gt; This was confirmed by Mary Lee Ware during her 1908 visit to Rudolf in a letter she wrote to the second director of the Botanical Museum, Professor [[Oakes Ames (botanist)|Oakes Ames]].&lt;ref name="schultes" /&gt; This letter appears to confirm the previous statement of Leopold's regarding his son; Miss Ware writes, ''"One change in the character of his work and, consequently in the time necessary to accomplish results since I was last here, is very noteworthy.At that time...he bought most of his glass and was just beginning to make some, and his finish was in paint. Now he himself makes a large part of the glass and all the enamels, which he powders to use as paint."''&lt;ref name="daston" /&gt; This missive to Professor Ames was published in January 9, 1961 by the [[Harvard University Herbaria]] - Botanical Museum Leaflets, Harvard University Vol. 19, No. 6 - under the title "How Were The Glass Flowers Made?"&lt;ref name="leaflet" /&gt; Indeed, and in addition to funding and visiting, Mary took a fairly active role in the project's progress, going so far as to personally unpack each model&lt;ref name="harvard ware" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cmog botanical" /&gt; and making arrangements for Rudolph's fieldwork in the U.S. and Jamaica&lt;ref name="harvard ware" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cmog botanical" /&gt; – the purpose of such trips being to gather and study various plant specimens before returning to the old style Bohemian lamp-working table at which he (and Leopold) worked.

It should also be noted that, in 1911, Rudolf Blaschka married Frieda (whose maiden name is unknown) in a quiet wedding: "We had only a few guests but a great deal of people here had shown cordial interest...We took a four day wedding trip to visit the Ore mountains and the Zenkerhuette in Josefsthal a 200 year old glass factory where my great-grandfather was master about 130-150 years ago...we reached the remote place easily by the new railroad and we had right the last chance to see the interesting factory building. They are just going to pull it down and it will disappear". Furthermore, the couple hosted Mary L. Ware during the third of her three visits to Dresden, and they became very great friends.&lt;ref name="harvard herbaria"/&gt;

Rudolf continued making models for Harvard until 1938. By then aged 80, old and weary, he announced that he would retire.&lt;ref name="life" /&gt; Neither he nor his father had taken on an [[apprentice]], and Rudolf left no successor - he and Frieda Blaschka being childless.&lt;ref name="urania" /&gt; For Harvard alone, Leopold and Rudolf made approximately 4,400 models, 780 showing species at life-size, with others showing magnified details; under 75% are, as of May 21, 2016, on display at the HMNH, (the exhibit itself dedicated to [[Charles Eliot Ware|Dr. Charles Eliot Ware]], the father of Mary Ware and husband of Elizabeth Ware); the old exhibit contained 3000 models but this number was reduced for renovation purposes.&lt;ref name="emison" /&gt; Unlike the Glass sea creatures – "a profitable global mail-order business"&lt;ref name="harvard flowers" /&gt; – the Glass Flowers were commissioned solely for and are unique to Harvard.

[[File:The grave of Leopold, Caroline, Rudolf and Frieda Blaschka.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|The grave of Leopold, Caroline, Rudolf and Frieda Blaschka]]

Over the course of their collected lives Leopold and Rudolf crafted as many as ten thousand glass marine invertebrate models in addition to the 4,400 botanical ones that are the more famous Glass Flowers.&lt;ref&gt;"Back to Back Bay After an Absence of Ten Years". The New York Times. June 10, 1951. p. XX17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey N. Swinney &amp; (2008) Enchanted invertebrates: Blaschka models and other simulacra in National Museums Scotland, Historical Biology, 20:1, 39-50, DOI: 10.1080/08912960701677036 - https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08912960701677036&lt;/ref&gt;

Leopold and Rudolf and their spouses are buried together in the Hosterwitz cemetery in Dresden.

The Blaschka studio survived the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II]] so, in 1993, the Corning Museum and Harvard jointly purchased the remaining Blaschka studio materials from Frieda Blaschka’s niece, Gertrud Pones.&lt;ref&gt;Drawing upon Nature: Studies for the Blaschkas’ Glass Models - http://www.cmog.org/publication/drawing-upon-nature-studies-blaschkas-glass-models-0&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="183734">This '''list of traditional territories of the original peoples of North America''' gives an overview of the names of the indigenous "countries" of North America. In this sense, "country" refers to the name of the ''land''...the ''ground''...the ''territory'' of a nation, rather than the name of the nation ("tribe") itself.  This article is only about the name for the ''land'' of a nation.

For example, the traditional territory (country/land) of the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) Nation is called ''Waaziija'', meaning "the Grand Pinery". In English, the land of an indigenous nation was historically, and sometimes still is, referred to as a "country", such as "(the) Winnebago country". Some Latinate forms exist in English such as "Iroquoia", "Huronia", and "Apacheria".

The distinction between nation and land is like the French people versus the land of ''France'', the Māori people versus ''Aotearoa'', or the Saami people versus ''[[Sápmi]]'' (Saamiland).

!width=35%|Autonym(s) for the traditional territory&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;When the name of a traditional territory has several possible etymologies, only one or a few English translations are given here (for example ''Ojibwewaki'' = "Land of the Record Keepers" is only one of several possibilities). For more, see the Wikipedia article for each nation and the various folk etymologies and proposed etymologies for their national name.&lt;/ref&gt;

! class="unsortable" |Further information
! style="width:2%" |Wikipedia article?&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;This column contains links to existing articles about a single nation's traditional territory. Ideally such Wikipedia articles would include a composite map which showed how each indigenous national territory is portrayed in all of these:
*key maps from scholars, such as the national boundaries from the ''Handbook of North American Indians'', Alfred Kroeber's culture area maps, and Sturtevant's 1967 "Early Indian Tribes, Culture Areas, &amp; Linguistic Stocks" map.
*key maps from general sources, such as the tribal boundaries from National Geographic's ''Indians of North America'' map from 1972.
*a map of all treaty lands which that nation is a party, as documented in the Royce land cession maps and the Canadian numbered treaties.
*the map(s) submitted by each U.S. Indian Nation during the Indian Claims Commission.
*the final ICC "judicially established" map.
*the NAGPRA "area of interest" map from each U.S. Indian Nation.
*a map showing the location of all former reservation lands.
*a map of current reservation and trust lands.
*the location of national sites and diasporic populations situated outside of those lands—for example, outlying historic villages (such as the [[Bulltown, West Virginia|Bulltown]] Lenape village in what's now West Virginia, which was never a part of Lenape treaty lands) and modern "satellite" communities (for example, the "at-large" Community Groups of the Cherokee Nation).
*a map of the State Designated Tribal Statistical Area (SDTSA) for state-recognized Indian Nations.
*and most importantly, "tribally-interpreted", "indigenous-approved" maps, such as the traditional territory maps from the ongoing British Columbia Treaty Process, and depictions of legendary boundaries from oral history.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2) In a wider sense, the name ''[[Dene]]'' encompasses all of the [[Northern Athabaskan]] peoples of Canada and Alaska.
{{extent}}The name "Denendeh", though now confined to the NWT, could conceivably be employed as a supra-national name for all the Northern Athabaskan traditional territories as a whole, in a similar way that "Anishinaabewaki" transcends modern political boundaries.

There is also [[NunatuKavut]] ("Our Ancient Land"), the traditional territory of the [[NunatuKavut people|NunatuKavummuit]] (Inuit-Metis) of southern Labrador. There are seven [[Alaskan Native Corporation]]s (see ANC link for map) which are predominantly Inuit in composition: [[Arctic Slope Regional Corporation]], [[NANA Regional Corporation]], [[Bering Straits Native Corporation]], [[Calista Corporation]], [[Bristol Bay Native Corporation]], [[Koniag, Incorporated|Koniag, Inc.]], and [[Chugach Alaska Corporation]].

The existing Inuit-affiliated political divisions and regional corporations only partially reflect the traditional cultural and linguistic diversity of the Inuitic peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[Inuit languages#Geographic distribution and variants]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the boundaries of the Danish political entity ''[[Kalaallit Nunaat]]'' are bigger than the traditional territory of the [[Kalaallit]] proper (West Greenland Inuit). There are two other Inuitic peoples in Greenland: the [[Tunumiit]] (East Greenland Inuit), who live in ''[[Tunu]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Tunu]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Inughuit]] (Polar Eskimos) of [[Avannaa|North Greenland]].

{{extent}}The national name ''Nēhiyaw'' is from the Plains Cree, but serves as a pan-Cree name (see for example the [[Cree|Cree Wikipedia article]]). So ''Nēhiýānāhk'' serves as a default name for Cree country as a whole, in a similar way that ''Anishinaabewaki'' is based on an Ojibwe spelling, but serves as common name for the entire supra-national Aninishinaabe traditional territory. The traditional territory of the East Crees is called [[Eeyou Istchee (territory)|''Eeyou Istchee'']] and ''Iynu Asci'' ("Land of the People"). ''Eeyou'' or ''Iyyu'' is the spelling in northern East Cree, while ''Iynu'' in southern East Cree. The traditional territory of the Plains Cree in particular is ''Paskwāwiýinīnāhk'' ("In the Land of the Plains Cree").&lt;ref name="Arok Wolvengrey 2001"/&gt;

==Criteria for inclusion==
For the purpose of this list, "nation" refers to the historic, whole national identities, rather than to the fragmented "reservation nations" or "bands". The whole nations are what John Beaucage, Grand Council Chief of the Anishinabek Nation, refers to as "true nations" in contrast with the fragmented "First Nations":

{{quote box|quote = “First Nations must work towards the restoration of our own model of nationhood made up of our '''true nations'''. In essence, moving away from '''633''' '''First Nations'''—from Aamjiwnaang to Zhiibhaasing—to governance based on the nearly '''60''' '''indigenous nations''', from the Abenaki Nation to the Wendat Nation and all those in between.”|source = —John Beaucage, “A Vision of a New Assembly of First Nations” (emphasis added), 2009&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.straight.com/news/john-beaucage-vision-new-assembly-first-nations John Beaucage: A vision of a new Assembly of First Nations]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720160156/http://www.straight.com/news/john-beaucage-vision-new-assembly-first-nations |date=July 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Or what the Government of Quebec calls "the 11 aboriginal nations of Québec" in contrast with their component "55 aboriginal communities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autochtones.gouv.qc.ca/relations_autochtones/profils_nations/profil_en.htm Profile of the Nations]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726032728/http://www.autochtones.gouv.qc.ca/relations_autochtones/profils_nations/profil_en.htm |date=July 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
And so the criteria for inclusion is not the same as what are named "Indian tribes" by the U.S. Federal Register and the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), or what are called "First Nations" by the Canadian government and Assembly of First Nations (AFN). It would be interesting to compile the names for the "band territories" of the 633 fragmented First Nations of the AFN, or the names of the "reservation territories" of the 632 fragmented Indian Nations of the NCAI, but that is beyond the scope of this article, except as side notes in the "further information" column.

So this list does not include the names for reservations or reserves, but only of the entire national homeland (or the homeland of a confederated identity such as the Haudenosaunee Confederacy or Colville tribes). For example, this list wouldn't give the Cherokee name for the Qualla Boundary reservation, but only the name for "the Cherokee country" as a whole. Ideally a single name could conceivably encompass not only the Contact-era ancestral territory, but also any area which at some time or another was conceived to be part of the national domain, such as post-Removal lands.

{{quote box|quote = "Northeastern Oklahoma is the seat of government for the sovereign nation of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma. However, all of the lands where the Miami have lived over time are still referred to as “Myaamionki” (the Place of the Myaamia)."|source = —The Miami Tribe of Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamination.com/~miamina1/newsite/node/11 Tribal Historic Preservation Office]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712162840/http://www.miamination.com/~miamina1/newsite/node/11 |date=July 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The names do not have to be from olden days. The names could be recently coined and still be included in this list.

Compiling a list such as this can be a difficult and controversial process, as it requires some discernment as to what are the "whole nations" — the "true nations" in Beaucage's words.

A '''MET''' ('''M'''aterials, '''E'''nergy, and '''T'''oxicity) '''Matrix''' is an [[analysis]] tool used to evaluate various [[environmental impact]]s of a product over its [[Life cycle analysis|life cycle]].  The tool takes the form of a 3x3 matrix with descriptive text in each of its cells.  One dimension of the matrix is composed of a qualitative input-output model that examines environmental concerns related to the product's materials use, energy use, and [[toxicity]].  The other dimension looks at the [[Life cycle analysis|life cycle]] of the product through its production, use, and [[Waste management|disposal]] phase.  The text in each cell corresponds to the intersection of two particular aspects.  For example, this means that by looking at certain cells, one can examine aspects such as energy use during the production phase, or levels of [[toxicity]] that may be a concern during the [[Waste management|disposal]] phase.&lt;ref&gt;René van Berkel, Esther Willems, and Marije Lafleur (1997) "Development of an industrial ecology toolbox for the introduction of industrial ecology in enterprises - I" ''Journal of Cleaner Production'' 1997, 5:1-2, pp 11-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harmonyoftheworld.jpg|thumb|right|300px|&lt;center&gt;Harmony of the world, 1806&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Musica universalis''' (literally '''universal music'''), also called '''Music of the spheres''' or '''Harmony of the Spheres''', is an ancient [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept that regards proportions in the movements of [[celestial bodies]]—the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planet]]s—as a form of ''musica'' (the [[Medieval]] [[Latin]] term for [[music]]). This "music" is not usually thought to be literally audible, but a [[harmonic]], [[mathematics|mathematical]] or [[religious]] concept.  The idea continued to appeal to thinkers about music until the end of the [[Renaissance]], influencing scholars of many kinds, including [[humanism|humanists]].  Further scientific exploration has determined specific proportions in some orbital motion, described as [[orbital resonance]].

== History ==
[[File:The music of the spheres.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Engraving from Renaissance Italy (Gafurius's ''Practica musice'', 1496) showing Apollo, the Muses, the planetary spheres and musical modes]]
{{See also|Pythagoreanism#Music and harmony}}

The discovery of the precise relation between the pitch of the musical note and the length of the string that produces it is attributed to Pythagoras.
The Music of the Spheres incorporates the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] principle that mathematical relationships express qualities or "tones" of energy which manifest in numbers, visual angles, shapes and sounds – all connected within a pattern of proportion. [[Pythagoras]]  first identified that the [[Pitch (music)|pitch of a musical note]] is in inverse proportion to the length of the string that produces it, and that intervals between harmonious sound frequencies form simple numerical ratios.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Weiss-2008|Weiss and Taruskin (2008)]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=q1eobgND8H4C&amp;pg=PA3 p. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;  In a theory known as the Harmony of the Spheres, Pythagoras proposed that the Sun, Moon and planets all emit their own unique hum based on their orbital revolution,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Pliny-77|Pliny the Elder (77)]] pp. 277–8, (II.xviii.xx): "…occasionally Pythagoras draws on the theory of music, and designates the distance between the Earth and the Moon as a whole tone, that between the Moon and Mercury as a semitone, .... the seven tones thus producing the so-called diapason, ''i.e.''. a universal harmony".&lt;/ref&gt; and that the quality of life on Earth reflects the tenor of celestial sounds which are physically imperceptible to the human ear.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Houlding-2000|Houlding (2000)]] p. 28: 

For [[Philolaus]], mathematician and Pythagorean astronomer, working around 400 BC, the world was 'harmony and numbers'; everything is ordered according to proportions that correspond to three basic musical intervals: 2:1 (harmony), 3:2 (fifth), 4:3 (fourth). Nicomachus of Gerasa (also a Pythagorean, towards the year 200 BC) assigns the notes of the octave to the celestial bodies, so that they generate a music.
"The doctrine of the Pythagoreans was a combination of science and mysticism… Like Anaximenes they viewed the Universe as one integrated, living organism, surrounded by Divine Air (or more literally 'Breath'), which permeates and animates the whole cosmos and filters through to individual creatures … By partaking of the core essence of the Universe, the individual is said to act as a microcosm in which all the laws in the macrocosm of the Universe are at work".&lt;/ref&gt;   Subsequently, Plato described astronomy and music as "twinned" studies of sensual recognition: astronomy for the eyes, music for the ears, and both requiring knowledge of numerical proportions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Davis-1901|Davis (1901)]] p. 252. Plato's ''Republic'' VII.XII reads: "As the eyes, said I, seem formed for studying astronomy, so do the ears seem formed for harmonious motions: and these seem to be twin sciences to one another, as also the Pythagoreans say".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] criticised the notion&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, On the Heavens, J.L. Stocks' translation, http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/heavens.2.ii.html&lt;/ref&gt; that celestial bodies make a sound in moving in the context of his own cosmological model. &lt;blockquote&gt;From all this it is clear that the theory that the movement of the stars produces a harmony, i.e. that the sounds they make are concordant, in spite of the grace and originality with which it has been stated, is nevertheless untrue. Some thinkers suppose that the motion of bodies of that size must produce a noise, since on our earth the motion of bodies far inferior in size and in speed of movement has that effect. Also, when the sun and the moon, they say, and all the stars, so great in number and in size, are moving with so rapid a motion, how should they not produce a sound immensely great? Starting from this argument and from the observation that their speeds, as measured by their distances, are in the same ratios as musical concordances, they assert that the sound given forth by the circular movement of the stars is a harmony. Since, however, it appears unaccountable that we should not hear this music, they explain this by saying that the sound is in our ears from the very moment of birth and is thus indistinguishable from its contrary silence, since sound and silence are discriminated by mutual contrast. What happens to men, then, is just what happens to coppersmiths, who are so accustomed to the noise of the smithy that it makes no difference to them. But, as we said before, melodious and poetical as the theory is, it cannot be a true account of the facts. There is not only the absurdity of our hearing nothing, the ground of which they try to remove, but also the fact that no effect other than sensitive is produced upon us. Excessive noises, we know, shatter the solid bodies even of inanimate things: the noise of thunder, for instance, splits rocks and the strongest of bodies. But if the moving bodies are so great, and the sound which penetrates to us is proportionate to their size, that sound must needs reach us in an intensity many times that of thunder, and the force of its action must be immense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The three branches of the Medieval concept of musica were presented by [[Boethius]] in his book ''De Musica'':&lt;ref&gt;Boethius, De institutione musica, I.2 (p. 187 Friedlein ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''musica mundana'' (sometimes referred to as ''musica universalis'')
* ''musica humana'' (the internal music of the human body)
* ''musica quae in quibusdam constituta est instrumentis'' (sounds made by singers and instrumentalists)

According to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings, the heavenly "music of the spheres" is heard in the ''Region of Concrete Thought'', the lower region of the [[mental plane]], which is an ocean of harmony.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

R.|date=1994|title=The music of the heavens: Kepler's harmonic astronomy|url=|journal=Physics Today|volume=48(6)|pages=59-60|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this connection between music and astronomy intrigued Johannes Kepler, and he devoted much of his time after publishing the [[Mysterium Cosmographicum|''Mysterium'' ''Cosmographicum'']] (Mystery of the Cosmos) looking over tables and trying to fit the data to what he believed to be the true nature of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mysterium Cosmographicum|last=Kepler|first=Johannes|year=1596|location=Tubingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28293391|title=Kepler|last=1880-1956.|first=Caspar, Max,|date=1993|publisher=Dover Publications|others=Hellman, Clarisse Doris, 1910-1973.|isbn=0486676056|location=New York|oclc=28293391}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1619 Kepler published ''Harmonices Mundi'' (literally Harmony of the Worlds), expanding on the concepts he introduced in ''Mysterium'' and positing that [[Interval (music)|musical intervals]] and [[Harmony|harmonies]] describe the motions of the six known planets of the time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36826094|title=The harmony of the world|last=1571-1630.|first=Kepler, Johannes,|date=1997|publisher=American Philosophical Society|others=Aiton, E. J., Duncan, A. M. (Alistair Matheson), Field, Judith Veronica.|isbn=0871692090|location=[Philadelphia, Pa.]|oclc=36826094}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that this harmony, while inaudible, could be heard by the soul, and that it gave a “very agreeable feeling of bliss, afforded him by this music in the imitation of God.” In ''Harmonices'', Kepler laid out an argument for a creator who had made an explicit connection between geometry, astronomy, and music, and that the planets were arranged in intelligently.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The scales of each of the six known planets, and the moon, placed on five-line staffs.]]
''Harmonices'' is split into five books, or chapters. The first and second books give a brief discussion on [[regular polyhedron]] and their [[Congruence (geometry)|congruences]], reiterating the idea he introduced in ''Mysterium'' that the five regular solids known about since antiquity define the orbits of the planets and their distances from the sun. Book three focuses on defining musical harmonies, including [[consonance and dissonance]], intervals (including the problems of just tuning), their relations to string length, and what makes music pleasurable to listen to. In the fourth book Kepler presents a metaphysical basis for this system, along with arguments for why the harmony of the worlds appeals to the intellectual soul in the same manner as the harmony of music appeals to the human soul. Here he also uses the naturalness of this harmony as an argument for [[heliocentrism]]. In book five, Kepler describes in detail the orbital motion of the planets and how this motion nearly perfectly matches musical harmonies. Finally, after a discussion on [[astrology]] in book five, Kepler ends ''Harmonices'' by describing his [[Third law of planetary motion|third law]], which states that for any planet the cube of the semi-major axis of its elliptical orbit is proportional to the square of its orbital period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the final book of ''Harmonices'', Kepler explains how the ratio of the maximum and minimum [[Angular velocity|angular speeds]] of each planet (its speeds at the perihelion and aphelion) is very nearly equivalent to a consonant musical interval. Furthermore, the ratios between these extreme speeds of the planets compared against each other create even more mathematical harmonies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These speeds explain the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the orbits of the planets in a natural way that appealed to Kepler’s religious beliefs in a heavenly creator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While Kepler did believe that the harmony of the worlds was inaudible, he related the motions of the planets to musical concepts in book four of ''Harmonices''. He makes an analogy between comparing the extreme speeds of one planet and the extreme speeds of multiple planets with the difference between [[Monophonic music|monophonic]] and [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] music. Because planets with larger eccentricities have a greater variation in speed they produce more “notes.” Earth’s maximum and minimum speeds, for example, are in a ratio of roughly 16 to 15, or that of a semitone, whereas Venus’ orbit is nearly circular, and therefore only produces a singular note. Mars, which has the largest eccentricity, has the largest interval, a minor tenth, or a ratio of 12 to 5. This range, as well as the relative speeds between the planets, led Kepler to conclude that the solar system was comprised of two basses ([[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]]), a tenor ([[Mars]]), two altos ([[Venus]] and [[Earth]]), and a soprano ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), which had sung in “perfect concord,” at the beginning of time, and could potentially arrange themselves to do so again.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was certain of the link between musical harmonies and the harmonies of the heavens and believed that “man, the imitator of the Creator,” had emulated the polyphony of the heavens so as to enjoy “the continuous duration of the time of the world in a fraction of an hour.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kepler was so convinced in a creator that he was convinced of the existence of this harmony despite a number of inaccuracies present in ''Harmonices''. Many of the ratios differed by an error greater than simple measurement error from the true value for the interval, and the ratio between Mars’ and Jupiter’s angular velocities does not create a consonant interval, though every other combination of planets does. Kepler brushed aside this problem by making the argument, with the math to support it, that because these [[elliptical]] paths had to fit into the regular solids described in ''Mysterium'' the values for both the dimensions of the solids and the angular speeds would have to differ from the ideal values to compensate. This change also had the benefit of helping Kepler retroactively explain why the regular solids encompassing each planet were slightly imperfect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Use in recent music==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
The connection between music, mathematics, and astronomy had a profound impact on history. It resulted in music's inclusion in the Quadrivium, the medieval curriculum that included arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy, and along with the Trivium (grammar, logic,and rhetoric) made up the seven liberal arts, which are still the basis for higher education today. A small number of recent compositions either make reference to or are based on the concepts of Musica Universalis or Harmony of the Spheres. Among these are ''[[Music of the Spheres (Mike Oldfield album)|Music of the Spheres]]'' by [[Mike Oldfield]], ''[[Om (The Moody Blues song)|Om]]'' by [[the Moody Blues]], ''[[The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi]]'' album by [[The Receiving End of Sirens]], ''[[Music of the Spheres (Ian Brown album)|Music of the Spheres]]'' by [[Ian Brown]]'','' and [[Björk]]'s single ''[[Cosmogony (song)|Cosmogony]]'', included in her 2011 album ''[[Biophilia (album)|Biophilia]]''. Earlier, in the 1910s, Danish composer [[Rued Langgaard]] composed a pioneering orchestral work titled ''[[Music of the Spheres (Langgaard)|Music of the Spheres]]''. ''Music of the Spheres'' was also the title chosen for the musical foundation of the video-game [[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]], and was composed by Martin O'Donnell, Michael Salvatori, and Paul McCartney. [[Paul Hindemith]] wrote an Opera (1957), and a Symphony using the same music, called 'Die Harmonie der Welt' based upon the life of the Astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630).

'''Nano neuro knitting''' is an emerging technology for repairing [[nervous system]] tissues via [[Nano-scaffold|nano scaffolding techniques]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ellis-Behnke, R.G.; Liang, Y.X.; You, S.W.; Tay, D.K.C.; Zhang, S.; So, K.F.; Schneider, G.E. Nano neuro knitting: Peptide nanofiber scaffold for brain repair and axon regeneration with functional return of vision. ''PNAS''. '''2006''', ''103'', 5054—5059.&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently being explored in numerous [[research]] endeavors, nano neuro knitting has been shown to allow partial [[reinnervation]] in damaged areas of the nervous system through the interactions between potentially regenerative [[axon]]s and [[peptide]] scaffolds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This interaction has been shown to lead to sufficient axon density renewal to the point that functionality is restored.  While nano neuro knitting shows promise, the uncertainty of the effects in human subjects warrants further investigation before [[clinical trial]]s initiate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Potential applications ==
Scaffolds produced using [[nanotechnology]] have enabled researchers to investigate clinically relevant applications that involve the promotion of tissue [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] at sites of acute damage.  In nano neuro knitting, these methods are applied specifically to the repair of tissues of the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis-Behnke, R.; Jonas, J.B. Redefining tissue engineering for nanomedicine in ophthalmology. ''Acta Ophthalmol''. '''2011''', ''89'', e108—e114.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and outlook ==

=== Ophthalmic applications ===
Nano neuro knitting has been researched for ophthalmic applications.  The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)]] has tested a [[self-assembling peptide]] [[nanofiber]] scaffold (SAPNS) on [[hamster]]s to repair [[optic tract]] damage.  Following injection, axon regeneration repaired the hamsters’ transected [[Superior colliculus|superior colliculi]] and restored vision in the tested animals.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, B. Nano Neuro-Knitting. http://www.dddmag.com/articles/2007/09/nano-neuro-knitting (accessed Oct, 2015) ''Drug Discovery &amp;''
Development''. '''2007''', ''9'', 56—60.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism behind the regeneration observed in these hamster [[Models of scientific inquiry|models]] has been proposed to involve local axons with the potential to regenerate, the surrounding [[Extracellular matrix|extracellular matrix (ECM)]], and the peptides of the nano scaffold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It has been shown that nano scaffolds can be carefully constructed to promote axonal growth and prevent [[Scar|scar formation]] at [[Lesion|lesion sites]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Using alternating positive and negative L-[[amino acid]]s to form [[Beta sheet|β-sheet]] [[Ionic bonding|ionic]] self-complementary peptides, nanofibers of the SAPNSs mimic the environment of the ECM and have been shown to serve as effective scaffolds in both ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' studies—appearing to be immunologically inert, feasibly [[Excretion|excreted]], and [[nontoxic]] to [[biological system]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Whereas previous research has attempted to [[Skin grafting|graft]] nerve tissue to the optic tract and resulted in complications (leg disabilities in the case of [[sciatic nerve]] grafts, for instance), nano neuro knitting has been shown to promote the regeneration of these tissues without such drawbacks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  While more research is required in order to understand how this technology works, [[scientist]]s propose that SAPNSs either facilitate this [[neuroregeneration]] by promoting cell migration into the lesion area or bringing the lesion areas in closer proximity via contraction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Central nervous system obstacles ===
One obstacle for [[drug delivery]] to the [[brain]] is the [[Blood–brain barrier|blood-brain barrier (BBB)]].  The small size of [[nanomaterials]], however, allows nanotechnologies to pass through.  The scaffolds that enable nano neuro knitting, hence, are able to bypass this boundary without affecting the BBB that serves the essential role of managing what can and cannot enter and leave the [[Central nervous system|central nervous system (CNS)]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ellis-Behnke, R.G.; Teather, L.A.; Schneider, G.E.; So, K.F. Using Nanotechnology to Design Potential Therapies for CNS Regeneration. ''Current Pharmaceutical Design''. '''2007''', ''13'', 2519—2528.&lt;/ref&gt;  While nano neuro knitting and other nanotechnologies may eventually replace procedures currently used to repair damage to the CNS through their improved [[biodistribution]] and [[pharmacokinetics]], the [[toxicity]] and long-term impacts of nanomaterial exposure in humans has yet to be sufficiently assessed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  While some studies demonstrate no immediate toxicity and [[immune responses]], it has yet to be determined if this holds true for the human CNS (with particular concern for the retention of these materials in the brain and their capacity to form [[Neurotoxicity|neurotoxic plaques]]) and the rest of the body’s systems over time.  Fortunately, SAPNSs may breakdown naturally by [[Protease|peptidase]] activity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition, promising monitoring methods are being explored in order to monitor axon regeneration ''in vivo'' that would provide [[patient]]s real-time [[feedback]] via [[manganese]]-enhanced [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MEMRI).  In this way, these potential [[Therapy|therapies]] could be monitored efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Liang, Y.X.; Cheung, S.W.H.; Chan, K.C.W.; Wu, E.X.; Tay, D.K.C.; Ellis-Behnke, R.G. CNS regeneration after chronic injury using a self-assembled nanomaterial and MEMRI for real-time in vivo monitoring. ''Nanomedicine: NBM''. '''2011''', ''7'', 351—359.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spinal cord injury repair ===
Research has demonstrated that nano scaffolds may be an effective tool for repairing [[Spinal cord injury|spinal cord injuries (SCIs)]].  Such studies have utilized [[rat]] models to show that electrospun nanofibers and SAPNSs can effectively serve as guidance channels for regeneration of neural tissue lost at sites of SCI.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Gelain, F.; Panseri, S.; Antonini, S.; Cunha, C.; Donega, M.; Lowery, J.; Taraballi, F.; Cerri, G.; Montagna, M.; Baldissera, F.; Vescovi, A. Transplantation of Nanostructured Composite Scaffolds Results in the Regeneration of Chronically Injured Spinal Cords. ''ACS Nano''. '''2011''', ''5'', 227—236.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using these scaffolds with integrated, slowly-released proregenerative [[cytokine]]s showed that SCI rat models could repair [[Bruise|contused]] [[spinal cord]] tissue.  After six months, the spinal cord [[cyst]]s were shown to be replaced by bundles of [[myelinated]] axons, ECM, and [[vascularization]].  In addition, the rat models have been shown to regain [[motor control]] after this treatment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Studies also suggest that culturing [[Schwann cell|Schwann cells (SCs)]] and [[Progenitor cell|neural progenitor cells (NPCs)]] in SAPNSs prior to [[Transplantation medicine|transplantation]] can significantly improve SCI repair.&lt;ref&gt;Guo, J.; Su, H.; Zeng, Y.; Liang, Y.X.; Wong, W.M.; Ellis-Behnke, R.G. Reknitting the injured spinal cord by self-assembling peptide nanofiber scaffold. ''Nanomedicine: NBM''. '''2007''', ''3'', 311—321.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''noise weighting''' is a specific amplitude-vs.-[[frequency]] characteristic that is designed to allow subjectively valid measurement of noise. It emphasises the parts of the spectrum that are most important.

Usually, noise means audible noise, in audio systems, broadcast systems or telephone circuits. In this case the [[weighting]] is sometimes referred to as [[Psophometric weighting]], though this term is best avoided because, although strictly a general term, the word Psophometric is sometimes assumed to refer to a particular weighting used in telecommunications.

A major use of noise weighting is in the measurement of residual noise in [[audio equipment]], usually present as hiss or hum in quiet moments of programme material. The purpose of weighting here is to emphasise the parts of the audible spectrum that our ears perceive most readily, and attenuate the parts that contribute less to our perception of loudness, in order to get a measured figure that correlates well with subjective effect. 

The [[ITU-R 468 noise weighting]] was devised specifically for this purpose, and is widely used in broadcasting, especially in the UK and Europe. [[A-weighting]] is also used, especially in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.95|title=1910.95 - Occupational noise exposure. {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this is only really valid for the measurement of tones, not noise, and is widely incorporated into sound level meters. 

In [[telecommunication]], noise weightings are used by agencies concerned with public telephone service, and various standard curves are based on the characteristics of specific commercial [[telephone]] instruments, representing successive stages of technological development. The [[Channel coding|coding]] of commercial apparatus appears in the nomenclature of certain weightings. The same weighting nomenclature and units are used in military versions of commercial noise measuring sets.

Telecommunication measurements are made in lines terminated either by the measuring set or an instrument of the relevant class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2457">The '''Nordic Network for Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies (NIES)''' is a research network for environmental studies based primarily in the humanities. By organizing regular conferences, symposia and workshops, NIES aims to create opportunities for researchers in the [[Nordic countries]] who address environmental questions to exchange ideas and develop their work in various interdisciplinary contexts. Fields represented by members of the network include [[Ecocriticism]], [[Environmental history]], [[Environmental philosophy]], [[Science and Technology Studies]], [[Art history]], [[Media studies]], [[Ecological economics]], [[Human Geography]], [[Cultural studies]], [[Anthropology]], [[Archeology]], [[Sustainability Studies]], [[Education for Sustainability]] and [[Landscape Studies]].

NIES is responsible for organizing and editing the research series '''''Studies in the Environmental Humanities (SEH)''''' published by [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]].

Formed in 2007, NIES was originally a cooperation among small academic groups in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Today, it includes more than 100 researchers from all the [[Nordic countries]].  The network actively sponsors a wide range of educational initiatives, research projects and public outreach activities and is a key partner in pan-European and other international initiatives to build capacity and foster theoretical advancement in the Environmental Humanities. Since January 2011, the network's primary anchoring institution is Mid Sweden University in Sundsvall, Sweden. National anchoring institutions include University of Turku, University of Oslo, University of Iceland, Uppsala University and University of Southern Denmark. The network's current phase of operations (2011–2015) is supported by NordForsk.

Non-response bias can be a problem in [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal research]] due to [[Attrition bias|attrition]] during the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/887254158|title=Research methods in health : Investigating health and health services|last=Ann|first=Bowling|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780335262755|location=Milton Keynes|pages=|oclc=887254158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
If one selects a sample of 1000 managers in a field and polls them about their workload, the managers with a high workload may not answer the survey because they do not have enough time to answer it, and/or those with a low workload may decline to respond for fear that their supervisors or colleagues will perceive them as surplus employees (either immediately, if the survey is non-anonymous, or in the future, should their anonymity be compromised). Therefore, non-response bias may make the measured value for the workload too low, too high, or, if the effects of the above biases happen to offset each other, "right for the wrong reasons."  For a simple example of this effect, consider a survey that includes, "Agree or disagree: I have enough time in my day to complete a survey."

In the [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936 U.S. presidential election]], ''[[The Literary Digest]]'' mailed out 10 million questionnaires, of which 2.3 million were returned.  Based on this, they predicted that Republican Alf Landon would win with 370 of 531 electoral votes;  he actually got 8.   [[United States presidential election, 1936#Camaign|Research published in 1976 and 1988]] concluded that [[Survey sampling#Bias in probability sampling|non-response bias]] was the primary source of this error, although their [[sampling frame]] was also quite different from the vast majority of voters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Non responders have been shown to be associated with younger patients, poorer communities and those who are less satisfied and subsequently could be a source of bias by a study published by Imam et al. in 2014.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Test ==
There are different ways to test for non-response bias. A common technique involves comparing the first and fourth quartiles of responses for differences in demographics and key constructs.&lt;ref name="Armstrong &amp; Overton 1977"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In e-mail surveys some values are already known from all potential participants (e.g. age, branch of the firm, ...) and can be compared to the values that prevail in the subgroup of those who answered. If there is no significant difference this is an indicator that there might be no non-response bias.

In e-mail surveys those who didn't answer can also systematically be phoned and a small number of survey questions can be asked. If their answers don't differ significantly from those who answered the survey, there might be no non-response bias.  This technique is sometimes called non-response follow-up.

Generally speaking, the lower the [[Response rate (survey)|response rate]], the greater the likelihood of a non-response bias in play.

==Related terminology==
*[[Self-selection bias]] is a type of bias in which individuals voluntarily select themselves into a group, thereby potentially biasing the response of that group.
*[[Response bias]] is not the opposite of non-response bias, but instead relates to a possible tendency of respondents to give inaccurate or untruthful answers for various reasons.

A '''phase change material''' ('''PCM''') is a substance with a high [[heat of fusion]] which, melting and solidifying at a certain temperature, is capable of storing and releasing large amounts of energy. Heat is absorbed or released when the material changes from solid to liquid and vice versa; thus, PCMs are classified as [[latent heat]] storage (LHS) units.

==Characteristics and classification==
Latent heat storage can be achieved through liquid→solid, solid→liquid, solid→gas and liquid→gas phase changes. However, only solid→liquid and liquid→solid phase changes are practical for PCMs. Although liquid–gas transitions have a higher heat of transformation than solid–liquid transitions, liquid→gas phase changes are impractical for thermal storage because large volumes or high pressures are required to store the materials in their gas phase. Solid–solid phase changes are typically very slow and have a relatively low heat of transformation.

Initially, solid–liquid PCMs behave like [[sensible heat]] storage (SHS) materials; their temperature rises as they absorb heat. Unlike conventional SHS materials, however, when PCMs reach the temperature at which they change phase (their melting temperature) they absorb large amounts of heat at an almost constant temperature. The PCM continues to absorb heat without a significant rise in temperature until all the material is transformed to the liquid phase. When the ambient temperature around a liquid material falls, the PCM solidifies, releasing its stored latent heat. A large number of PCMs are available in any required temperature range from −5 up to 190&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Kenisarin"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2006.05.005 |title=Solar energy storage using phase change materials |year=2007 |last1=Kenisarin |first1=M |last2=Mahkamov |first2=K |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=1913–1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the human comfort range between 20–30&amp;nbsp;°C, some PCMs are very effective. They store 5 to 14 times more heat per unit volume than conventional storage materials such as water, masonry or rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2007.10.005|title=Review on thermal energy storage with phase change materials and applications|year=2009|last1=Sharma|first1=Atul|last2=Tyagi|first2=V.V.|last3=Chen|first3=C.R.|last4=Buddhi|first4=D.|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=13|issue=2|pages=318–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** Change of volume is very high
** Super cooling is major problem in solid–liquid transition
** Nucleating agents are needed and they often become inoperative after repeated cycling[[File:InfiniteR Energy Sheet.png|alt=Infinite R Energy Sheet|thumb|Example eutectic salt hydrate PCM with nucleation &amp; gelling agents for long term thermal stability and thermoplastic foil macro-encapsulation physical durability.

=== Inorganic Eutectics ===
c-inorganic, inorganic-inorganic compounds
* Advantages
** Some inorganic eutectics have sharp melting point similar to pure substance.
** Volumetric storage density is slightly above organic compounds.
** Extra water principle can be used to avoid phase change degradation, involving dissolving the anhydrous salt during melting to result in a thickening of the liquid material so that it melts to a gel form; however, this can cause huge reduction in latent heat.
* Disadvantages
** They still have the same disadvantages as inorganic PCMs, such as reduced thermal performance upon cycling, corrosivity, high volume change, and high supercooling.
** Sharp crystals may form when the salt hydrate PCM solidifies, potentially causing leaks in cases of macro-encapsulation.
** Limited data is available on thermo-physical properties as the use of these materials is limited compared to organic PCMs.

=== Hygroscopic materials ===

Many natural building materials are hygroscopic, that is they can absorb (water condenses) and release water (water evaporates). The process is thus:
*Condensation (gas to liquid) ΔH&lt;0; enthalpy decreases (exothermic process) gives off heat.
*Vaporization (liquid to gas) ΔH&gt;0; enthalpy increases (endothermic process) absorbs heat (or cools).

Whilst this process liberates a small quantity of energy, large surfaces area allows significant (1–2&amp;nbsp;°C) heating or cooling in buildings. The corresponding materials are wool insulation, earth/clay render finishes,.

=== Solid-solid PCM materials ===

A specialised group of PCMs that undergo a solid/solid phase transition with the associated absorption and release of large amounts of heat. These materials change their crystalline structure from one lattice configuration to another at a fixed and well-defined temperature, and the transformation can involve latent heats comparable to the most effective solid/liquid PCMs. Such materials are useful because, unlike solid/liquid PCMs, they do not require nucleation to prevent supercooling. Additionally, because it is a solid/solid phase change, there is no visible change in the appearance of the PCM, and there are no problems associated with handling liquids, e.g. containment, potential leakage, etc. Currently the temperature range of solid-solid PCM solutions spans from -50&amp;nbsp;°C (-58&amp;nbsp;°F) up to +175&amp;nbsp;°C (347&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://phasechange.com/products/phasestor/|title=Phase Change Energy Solutions PhaseStor|last=|first=|date=|website=Phase Change Energy Solutions|access-date=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology, development and encapsulation==

The most commonly used PCMs are salt [[hydrate]]s&lt;!-- Only for housing applications? --&gt;, [[fatty acid]]s and [[ester]]s, and various [[Alkane|paraffin]]s (such as [[octadecane]]). Recently also [[ionic liquid]]s were investigated as novel PCMs.

As most of the organic solutions are water-free, they can be exposed to air, but all salt based PCM solutions must be encapsulated to prevent water evaporation or uptake. Both types offer certain advantages and disadvantages and if they are correctly applied some of the disadvantages becomes an advantage for certain applications.

They have been used since the late 19th century as a medium for the [[thermal storage]] applications. They have been used in such diverse applications as refrigerated transportation&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/3650.html Frederik Tudor the Ice King] on ice transport during the 19th century&lt;/ref&gt; for rail&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Trevithick]]'s steam locomotive ran in 1804&lt;/ref&gt; and road applications&lt;ref&gt;[[Amédée Bollée]] created [[steam car]]s beginning at 1873&lt;/ref&gt; and their physical properties are, therefore, well known.

Unlike the ice storage system, however, the PCM systems can be used with any conventional water [[chiller]] both for a new or alternatively retrofit application. The positive temperature phase change allows centrifugal and absorption chillers as well as the conventional reciprocating and screw chiller systems or even lower ambient conditions utilizing a [[cooling tower]] or dry cooler for charging the TES system.

The temperature range offered by the PCM technology provides a new horizon for the building services and refrigeration engineers regarding medium and high temperature energy storage applications. The scope of this thermal energy application is wide-ranging of solar heating, hot water, heating rejection, i.e. cooling tower and dry cooler circuitry thermal energy storage applications.

Since PCMs transform between solid–liquid in thermal cycling, encapsulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2005.10.002|title=PCM thermal storage in buildings: A state of art|year=2007|last1=Tyagi|first1=Vineet Veer|last2=Buddhi|first2=D.|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=11|issue=6|pages=1146–1166}}&lt;/ref&gt; naturally become the obvious storage choice.

*Encapsulation of PCMs
**Macro-encapsulation: Early development of macro-encapsulation with large volume containment failed due to the poor [[thermal conductivity]] of most PCMs. PCMs tend to solidify at the edges of the containers preventing effective heat transfer.
**Micro-encapsulation: [[Micro-encapsulation]] on the other hand showed no such problem. It allows the PCMs to be incorporated into construction materials, such as [[concrete]], easily and economically. Micro-encapsulated PCMs also provide a portable heat storage system. By coating a microscopic sized PCM with a protective coating, the particles can be [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] within a continuous phase such as water. This system can be considered a '''phase change [[slurry]]''' ('''PCS''').
**Molecular-encapsulation is another technology, developed by Dupont de Nemours that allows a very high concentration of PCM within a polymer compound. It allows storage capacity up to 515&amp;nbsp;[[Kilojoule|kJ]]/[[Square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] for a 5&amp;nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]] board (103&amp;nbsp;[[Megajoule|MJ]]/[[Cubic metre|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]). Molecular-encapsulation allows drilling and cutting through the material without any PCM leakage.

As phase change materials perform best in small containers, therefore they are usually divided in cells. The cells are shallow to reduce static head – based on the principle of shallow container geometry. The packaging material should conduct heat well; and it should be durable enough to withstand frequent changes in the storage material's volume as phase changes occur. It should also restrict the passage of water through the walls, so the materials will not dry out (or water-out, if the material is [[hygroscopic]]). Packaging must also resist leakage and [[corrosion]]. Common packaging materials showing chemical compatibility with room temperature PCMs include [[stainless steel]], [[polypropylene]] and [[polyolefin]].

==Thermal composites==

Thermal-composites is a term given to combinations of phase change materials (PCMs) and other (usually solid) structures. A simple example is a copper-mesh immersed in a paraffin-wax. The copper-mesh within parraffin-wax can be considered a composite material, dubbed a thermal-composite. Such hybrid materials are created to achieve specific overall or bulk properties.

Thermal conductivity is a common property which is targeted for maximisation by creating thermal composites. In this case the basic idea is to increase thermal conductivity by adding a highly conducting solid (such as the copper-mesh) into the relatively low conducting PCM thus increasing overall or bulk (thermal) conductivity. If the PCM is required to flow, the solid must be porous, such as a mesh.

Solid composites such as fibre-glass or kevlar-pre-preg for the aerospace industry usually refer to a fibre (the kevlar or the glass) and a matrix (the glue which solidifies to hold fibres and provide compressive strength). A thermal composite is not so clearly defined, but could similarly refer to a matrix (solid) and the PCM which is of course usually liquid and/or solid depending on conditions.
They are also meant to discover minor elements in the earth.

* [[Thermal energy storage]]
* Solar cooking
* [[Cold Energy Battery]]
* [[HVAC|Conditioning of buildings]], such as 'ice-storage'
* Cooling of heat and electrical engines
* Cooling: food, beverages, coffee, wine, milk products, green houses
* Medical applications: transportation of blood, operating tables, hot-cold therapies, treatment of [[birth asphyxia]]&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"/&gt; 
* Human body cooling under bulky clothing or costumes.
* [[Waste heat]] recovery
* [[Off-peak]] power utilization: Heating hot water and Cooling
* [[Heat pump]] systems
* Passive storage in [[bioclimatic building]]/architecture ([[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]], paraffin)
* Smoothing [[exothermic]] temperature peaks in chemical reactions
* [[Solar power]] plants
* [[Spacecraft]] thermal systems
* [[Thermal comfort]] in vehicles
* [[Thermal protection]] of electronic devices
* Thermal protection of food: transport, hotel trade, ice-cream, etc.
* Textiles used in clothing
* [[Computer cooling]]
* Turbine Inlet Chilling with thermal energy storage
* Telecom shelters in tropical regions. They protect the high-value equipment in the shelter by keeping the indoor air temperature below the maximum permissible by absorbing heat generated by power-hungry equipment such as a [[Base Station Subsystem]]. In case of a power failure to conventional cooling systems, PCMs minimize use of [[diesel generator]]s, and this can translate into enormous savings across thousands of telecom sites in tropics.

==Fire and safety issues==
Some phase change materials are suspended in water, and are relatively nontoxic. Others are hydrocarbons or other flammable materials, or are toxic. As such, PCMs must be selected and applied very carefully, in accordance with fire and building codes and sound engineering practices. Because of the increased fire risk, flamespread, smoke, potential for explosion when held in containers, and liability, it may be wise not to use flammable PCMs within residential or other regularly occupied buildings. Phase change materials are also being used in thermal regulation of electronics.

Photoheterotrophs generate [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] using light, in one of two ways:&lt;ref name=Bryant2006&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2006.09.001| issn = 0966-842X| volume = 14| issue = 11| pages = 488–496| last = Bryant| first = Donald A.|author2=Niels-Ulrik Frigaard| title = Prokaryotic photosynthesis and phototrophy illuminated| journal = Trends in Microbiology| accessdate = 2012-03-30| date = November 2006| url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X06002265| pmid=16997562}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zubkov2009&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1093/plankt/fbp043| issn = 0142-7873| volume = 31| issue = 9| pages = 933–938| last = Zubkov| first = Mikhail V| title = Photoheterotrophy in Marine Prokaryotes| journal = Journal of Plankton Research| accessdate = 2012-03-30| date = 2009-09-01| url = http://plankt.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/9/933}}&lt;/ref&gt; they use a [[bacteriochlorophyll]]-based reaction center, or they use a [[bacteriorhodopsin]]. The [[chlorophyll]]-based mechanism is similar to that used in photosynthesis, where light excites the molecules in a reaction center and causes a flow of electrons through an [[electron transport chain]] (ETS). This flow of electrons through the proteins causes hydrogen ions to be pumped across a membrane. The energy stored in this [[hydron (chemistry)|proton]] gradient is used to drive [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] synthesis. Unlike in [[photoautotroph]]s, the electrons flow only in a cyclic pathway: electrons released from the reaction center flow through the ETS and return to the reaction center. They are not utilized to [[redox|reduce]] any organic compounds. [[Purple bacteria|Purple non-sulfur bacteria]], [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|green non-sulfur bacteria]] and [[heliobacteria]] are examples of bacteria that carry out this scheme of photoheterotrophy.

The [[archaea]]l version is called [[bacteriorhodopsin]], while the [[eubacteria]]l version is called  [[proteorhodopsin]]. The pump consists of a single protein bound to a Vitamin A derivative, [[retinal]]. The pump may have accessory pigments (e.g., [[carotenoid]]s) associated with the protein. When light is absorbed by the retinal molecule, the molecule isomerises. This drives the protein to change shape and pump a proton across the membrane. The hydrogen ion gradient can then be used to generate ATP, transport solutes across the membrane, or drive a [[flagellum#Bacterial|flagellar motor]]. One particular flavobacterium cannot reduce carbon dioxide using light, but uses the energy from its rhodopsin system to [[carbon fixation|fix]] carbon dioxide through [[Anaplerotic reactions|anaplerotic]] fixation.&lt;ref name=Gonzales2008/&gt; The flavobacterium is still a [[heterotroph]] as it needs reduced carbon compounds to live and cannot subsist on only light and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It cannot carry out reactions in the form of
:n CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2n H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D + [[photons]] → [[carbohydrate|(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2n D + n H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O,
where H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D may be water, [[hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] or another compound/compounds providing the reducing electrons and protons; the 2D + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O pair represents an oxidized form.

However, it can fix carbon in reactions like:
:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + [[pyruvate]] + [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] (from [[photons]]) → [[malate]] + ADP +P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
where malate or other useful molecules are otherwise obtained by breaking down other compounds by
:carbohydrate + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → malate + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + energy.

This method of carbon fixation is useful when reduced carbon compounds are scarce and cannot be wasted as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during interconversions, but energy is plentiful in the form of sunlight.

'''Piedmont College''' is a private, comprehensive, liberal arts institution located in [[Demorest, Georgia|Demorest]] and [[Athens, Georgia]], United States. Founded in 1897, Piedmont's Demorest campus includes 300 acres in a traditional residential-college setting located in the foothills of the northeast Georgia Blue Ridge mountains. The campus includes ten dormitories housing more than 600 students. Academic and athletic facilities are all state-of-the-art. Approximately 50 miles to the south, Piedmont's Athens campus is located in the heart of Georgia's Classic City. The Athens campus provides a variety of undergraduate and graduate programs designed for commuting students.

Piedmont College offers more than 50 undergraduate academic programs in the Schools of Arts &amp; Sciences, Business, Education, and Nursing &amp; Health Sciences. Students may earn Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), Bachelor of Science (BS), or Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degrees. Graduate programs include Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Arts (MA) and Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT), Education Specialist (EdS), and Doctor of Education (EdD).

Enrollment is approximately 2,361 students, and the student-faculty ratio is 10:1.{{cite web | url = http://www.piedmont.edu| title = Piedmont College |publisher = Piedmont College| accessdate = 2018-09-07}} While most students come from Georgia, the college attracts applicants from across the U.S. and around the world, creating a diverse academic community with a variety of religious and ethnic backgrounds.

==History==
{{Main|History of Piedmont College}}
The college opened as the J.S. Green Collegiate Institute&lt;ref name="js green college"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.piedmontnavigator.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=bf65c584-f102-4483-a9e0-e8d5168144ec | title = J.S.

The first president was Reverend Charles C. Spence. The American Mission Board of the New England Congregational Churches operated the college from 1901 to 1948  and changed the name to Piedmont College to represent the geographic region. In 1948, under president James Walter, the college became an independent institution, although it maintains an affiliation with the [[United Church of Christ]] (UCC) and the related [[National Association of Congregational Christian Churches]] (NACCC).&lt;ref name="centennial history"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lane |first=Mary Charlotte Ed.D |title=Centennial History of Piedmont College: 1897-1997 |publisher=Piedmont College |year=1997 |location=Demorest, Ga. |pages=1–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congregationalists took over the school from the [[Methodists]] in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="history2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lane |first=Mary Charlotte Ed.D |title=Piedmont College History 1897-1990 |publisher=Piedmont College |year=1993|location=Demorest, Ga.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s to the 1990s, Piedmont grew slowly and developed a reputation as a small college with high academic standards. The college graduated a large number of teachers who went on to distinguished careers in education across the state. In 1994 the college began to expand, adding schools for Business and Nursing &amp; Health Sciences to its existing programs in the Arts and Sciences and Education. The college also opened a campus in Athens, Georgia, and began offering off-campus graduate education courses across the state. The Demorest campus grew substantially with the addition of the Arrendale Library; Stewart Center for Mathematics, Science and Technology; Swanson Center for Communications and the Performing Arts, Mize Athletic Center, the Smith-Williams Art Studios, and in 2015 the Student Commons. The college also added five new dormitories and 48 apartment-style residences.

Today Piedmont is one of the most dynamic small colleges in the Southeast, known equally for its academic programs in education, business, nursing and health sciences, and the arts and sciences. As a member of the USA South Conference of the NCAA Division III, Piedmont competes in 17 men’s and women’s sports.

Piedmont has a history of more than 120 years of providing education to people from across the world. There have been eleven presidents of the college who have each helped Piedmont get to where it is now.

==Campuses==
Piedmont has two campuses, the original one in Demorest and the newer expansion in Athens. Piedmont's Demorest campus is located on roughly {{convert|300|acre|ha|1}} in [[Habersham County]]. The Athens campus is located on Prince Avenue near downtown Athens, on the site of the original Prince Avenue Baptist Church.

===Demorest===
[[File:Piedmont-stewart.jpg|thumb|left|Stewart Hall, one of Piedmont's classroom buildings, houses labs and classroom space for the mathematics and sciences departments.]]
The Demorest campus is primarily a residential campus, with ten [[dormitories]], including Getman-Babcock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thenortheastgeorgian.com/articles/2008/10/21/news/education/03education.txt|title=Piedmont plans 'Haunted Hotel'|date=2008-10-21|work=The Northeast Georgian|publisher=Community Newspapers Inc|accessdate=14 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Purcell, Wallace, Swanson, Johnson, Mayflower, New Bedford, Plymouth and Ipswich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REsidence Life Home|url=http://piedmont.edu/pc/index.php/campus-life/resident-life|publisher=Piedmont College|accessdate=9/2/13}}&lt;/ref&gt; halls that together house about 600 students. The Piedmont Village (apartment-style living which opened in 2015) houses an additional 180 students.

The academic buildings include Daniel Hall, which houses the R.H. Daniel School of Nursing, the [[Humanities]] Department, and administrative offices. Stewart Hall houses the Science and Math Departments. The School of Education is located in the Arrendale Library. The Walker School of Business is located in Camp Hall, which is adjacent to the President’s Home. The Music department is located in the Center for Worship and Music, which includes classroom and performance space, as well as the Sewell Pipe Organ, a 3,675-pipe organ built by the Casavant Frères company of Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec.

The Art Department is located in the Smith-Williams Studios and adjacent Martens Hall. The Mason-Scharfenstein Museum of Art is located in downtown Demorest. It features a large permanent collection and hosts numerous exhibits throughout the year.

The Mass Communications and Theatre Departments are located in the Swanson Center for Performing Arts and Communication, a $14-million building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thenortheastgeorgian.com/articles/2009/10/30/news/business/01business.txt|title=Business resource seminar set Nov. 5 at Piedmont College|date=2009-10-29|work=The Northeast Georgian|publisher=Community Newspapers INC|accessdate=14 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which features two theaters and editing rooms for print, video and web productions. Next door is the Arrendale Amphitheater, a 500-seat outdoor [[Theater (structure)|venue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thenortheastgeorgian.com/articles/2009/03/24/news/top_stories/04topstory.txt|title=Progressing Toward Premier|last=Brown|first=Kimberly|date=2009-03-24|work=The Northeast Georgian|publisher=Community Newspapers Inc|accessdate=14 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; WPCZ, the student-run radio station, is housed in the Swanson Center, along with the student-run TV station, PC60.

The campus also includes Walker Fields for [[softball]], [[soccer]] and [[lacrosse]], as well as Loudermilk Baseball Stadium for [[baseball]]. The [[Johnny Mize]] Athletic Center houses the O’Neal Cave Arena for [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]]. The Mize Center includes a [[museum]] featuring displays of Mize’s baseball memorabilia collected during his career at Piedmont and as a Hall of Fame player in the major leagues with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], [[San Francisco Giants]] (New York Giants) and [[New York Yankees]].

[[File:Piedmont Pedestrian Bridge.JPG|thumb|250px|The pedestrian footbridge at Piedmont College connects to pieces of campus which are separated by Historic U.S. 441 Highway.]]
There are also a few general purpose buildings. Lane Hall, which faces the quad, is the remodeled old gym, which houses the Student Success Center. There is also the President's House, the Admissions building and the pedestrian bridge which crosses [[U.S. Route 441|Historic U.S. 441]].&lt;ref name="bridge1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Rob |title=Pedestrian Bridge Installation Rescheduled |work=The Northeast Georgian |publisher=Community Newspapers, Inc. |date=2008-08-04 |accessdate=2008-08-08 |url=http://www.thenortheastgeorgian.com/articles/2008/08/04/news/breaking_news/08breakingnews.txt }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge was assembled off-site and lowered into place by crane,&lt;ref name="bridge2"&gt;{{cite news |work=Access North Georgia |title=Demorest Bridge Installation Delayed |publisher=Jacobs Media |date=2008-07-30 |accessdate=2008-08-08 |url=http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail.php?n=211932&amp;c=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was modeled after the [[Vanderbilt University]] 21st Avenue Pedestrian Bridge. The installation of the bridge was a joint project of the Georgia Department of Transportation, Piedmont College and the city of Demorest.

Much of Piedmont's Demorest property is now [[wetlands]]. The wetlands area was once the site of Lake Demorest from 1890-2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thenortheastgeorgian.com/articles/2008/08/19/news/top_stories/04topstory.txt|title=Demorest lake drained for wetlands|last=Moore|first=Rob|date=2008-08-19|work=The Northeast Georgian|publisher=Community Newspapers Inc|accessdate=14 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lake was drained due to an irreparable dam, and the property was turned into a wetlands for students and faculty to use in their studies.

The heart of student life at Piedmont is the new Student Commons, which opened in the fall of 2015. The 58,000 square foot commons features the campus dining hall, fitness center (complete with a full-size basketball court with a walking track, a rock-climbing wall and a racquetball court), the official Piedmont College bookstore and a Starbucks cafe. The commons also is home to Student Services and has a state-of-the-art conference room and study rooms as well as staff offices.

===Athens===
The college opened a small outreach facility&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/022207/news_20070222076.shtml |date=22 February 2007 |accessdate=15 June 2010 |title=Piedmont College begins push to lure its first freshman class |work=Athens Banner Herald |publisher=Online Athens |last=Quigley |first=Rebecca |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614035223/http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/022207/news_20070222076.shtml |archive-date=2011-06-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996 and now occupies seven buildings near the heart of downtown Athens on Prince Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/091307/news_20070913041.shtml |work=Athens Banner Herald |publisher=Online Athens |last=Quigley |first=Rebecca |title=College-bound teens scout options |date=12 September 2007 |accessdate=15 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614035315/http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/091307/news_20070913041.shtml |archive-date=2011-06-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus offers four-year undergraduate programs designed for both traditional and non-traditional students. For graduate students, there are programs in business (MBA), nursing (BSN and MSN), and education (MA, MAT, EDS, and EDD).

The Athens campus includes Commons Hall, which houses the majority of classrooms and faculty offices, as well as a large assembly room and dining hall. The School of Business is located in Rogers Hall, and there is a large recreation center for intramural and fitness activities. Lane Hall on North Milledge Avenue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Webwire |url=http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=118350 |title=Atlanta Legal Nurse Consultant Attends 2nd Annual "Illicit Drug" Conference |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; houses the library and facilities for the School of Nursing and Health Sciences.

Every spring semester, the nursing department conducts a disaster drill where the senior nursing majors have to diagnose a large group of patients. Past themes for the drill have included a boiler explosion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenortheastgeorgian.com/articles/2008/04/22/news/top_stories/01topstory.txt |title=Drilling for disaster |date=22 April 2008 |work=The Northeast Georgian |publisher=Community Newspapers Inc |accessdate=18 June 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; a car accident at an outdoor concert,&lt;ref name="car accident"/&gt; a small plane crash and a gas tank explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.piedmont.edu/news/view/101 |title=Student nurses, HCMC respond to ‘disaster’ |last=Price|first=David|work= Institutional Advancement |publisher=Piedmont |date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
In addition to clubs and service organizations, Piedmont offers creative outlets for singers, musicians, and actors. All students can be part of the 100-voice Piedmont Chorale, which performs several concerts each year. The Piedmont Singers is a 50-member ensemble of selected students that performs on campus and each year tours in the U.S. or abroad. Performance groups also include the 10-member Cantabile a cappella singers, Piedmont Camerata chamber ensemble, Wind Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble, and String Ensemble.

Students interested in theatre may join the Piedmont College Theatre and the [[Alpha Psi Omega]] theatre honor society, which together perform a succession of plays each year ranging from Shakespeare to children's theatre.

Students interested in writing, photography, radio, television, and web production can also participate in a number of student-run organizations including the student newspaper and media channel, "The Roar" [formerly The Navigator]; the Yonahian yearbook, and student radio and TV stations.&lt;ref name="publications"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.piedmontnavigator.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=40defd1c-fc56-43a3-88f1-efa74fc97ff2 | title = Publishing Piedmont | last = Suda | first = Tim | work = The Navigator | date = 2008-01-14 | accessdate = 2008-05-11 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120216065656/http://www.piedmontnavigator.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=40defd1c-fc56-43a3-88f1-efa74fc97ff2 | archivedate = 2012-02-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magazine===
The first publication for the college was ''The Mountain Lantern'', which was named for a common firefly in the surrounding area. ''The Lantern'' started out as a monthly magazine in 1912.  In 1913, ''The Lantern'' became the college's yearbook. There would not be a magazine again until the spring semester of 2006, when a mass communications major published ''PC Magazine'' as her senior capstone project. In the fall of 2007, the magazine was renamed ''Pause'', which came out twice each semester; two print and two online. ''Pause'' has since been out of production.

===Yearbook===
''The Mountain Lantern'' lasted for only a short period until 1915. A yearbook was again issued in 1920, and the name was changed to the ''Yonahian''.  The odd-sounding name was derived from nearby [[Mount Yonah]]. Since 1920, the ''Yonahian'' has been published every year and provides a general record of students and faculty.

===Newspaper===
The first newspaper of Piedmont was ''The Hustler,'' which lasted from 1908 to 1909. There was no newspaper until 1917, when a bi-weekly newspaper named ''The Padded Hammer'' appeared in September. Later in 1917, after a vote on the name of the paper, it was changed to ''The Piedmont Owl''. The name was chosen as a reference to the concept of wisdom. This became the name of Piedmont's athletic teams as well, until 1921, when the Student Association adopted the name Mountain Lions, later shortened to Lions.&lt;ref name="thesis2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rountree |first=George Wilburn |title=Piedmont College: its history, resources, and programs |publisher=University of Georgia (Doctrinal Dissertation) |location=Athens, Ga. |year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Piedmont Owl'' lasted for 67 years until the name was changed to match Piedmont's newer mascot. The paper became ''The Lion's Roar'' for 21 years until 2005, when it was changed to ''The Navigator''. The name is a reference to the ''[[Mayflower]]'' ship of the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]], honoring Piedmont's relationship to American [[Congregational church|Congregationalism]]. In the fall of 2015, all the college's media outlets were consolidated under the umbrella name of ''The Roar''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piedmontroar.com ''The Roar'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual life==
The Office of the Chaplain provides a variety of opportunities for religious expression among students. As a church-related college, Piedmont recognizes that faith and learning are frequently intertwined. In keeping with Congregationalism, the college acknowledges that each individual understands and relates to God in a unique way, and that the student body will always represent a breadth of religious backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences. Spiritual life at Piedmont exists to nurture and nourish the spiritual health and well-being of the students, faculty, and staff. The campus minister supports student-initiated programs, creates space for a variety of spiritual groups, collaborates with academic departments on spiritual programming, and continues to foster relationships with the school's church partners, the United Church of Christ (UCC) and the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches (NACCC), as well as local faith communities and social service agencies.

==Athletics==
[[Image:Piedmont Lions Basketball.jpg|thumb|left|Piedmont College is an NCAA Division-III member school, home to 17 intercollegiate athletic programs.]]
Piedmont College teams participate as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]]. The Lions are a member of the [[USA South Athletic Conference]]. Intercollegiate sports include men's and women's basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and track and field; women's volleyball and softball; and men's baseball. In 2016, Piedmont introduced men's and women's cycling. The college also offers a wide range of intramural sports competitions.

Piedmont was a charter member of the [[Great South Athletic Conference]] (GSAC) until the 2012-13 school year.

'''Process simulation''' is used for the design, development, analysis, and optimization of technical processes such as: [[chemical plant]]s, [[chemical process]]es, environmental systems, [[power station]]s, complex manufacturing operations, biological processes, and similar technical functions.

== Main principle ==
[[Image:AmineTreating.png|thumb|Process flow diagram of a typical amine treating process used in industrial plants]] 

Process simulation is a '''model'''-based representation of [[Chemistry|chemical]], [[Physics|physical]], [[Biology|biological]], and other technical processes and [[unit operation]]s in software. Basic prerequisites are a thorough knowledge of chemical and physical properties&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes C.L., “The Process Simulation Revolution: Thermophysical Property Needs and Concerns”, J.Chem.Eng.Data, 41, 947-950, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; of pure components and mixtures, of reactions, and of mathematical models which, in combination, allow the calculation of a process in computers.

Process simulation software describes processes in [[process flow diagram|flow diagram]]s where [[unit operation]]s are positioned and connected by product or educt streams. The software has to solve the [[mass balance|mass]] and [[First law of thermodynamics|energy balance]] to find a stable operating point. The goal of a process simulation is to find optimal conditions for an examined process. This is essentially an [[Optimization (computer science)|optimization]] problem which has to be solved in an iterative process.

Process simulation always use models which introduce [[approximation]]s and assumptions but allow the description of a property over a wide range of temperatures and pressures which might not be covered by real data. Models also allow [[interpolation]] and [[extrapolation]] - within certain limits - and enable the search for conditions outside the range of known properties.

== Modelling ==
The development of models&lt;ref&gt;Gani R., Pistikopoulos E.N., “Property Modelling and Simulation for Product and Process Design″, Fluid Phase Equilib., 194-197, 43-59, 2002
&lt;/ref&gt; for a better representation of real processes is the core of the further development of the simulation software. Model development is done on the chemical engineering side but also in control engineering and for the improvement of mathematical simulation techniques. Process simulation is therefore one of the few fields where scientists from [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], and several [[engineering]] fields work together.

[[File:Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium of the Mixture of Chloroform and Methanol NRTL Fit and Extrapolation to Different Pressures.png|thumb|[[Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium|VLE]] of the mixture of Chloroform and Methanol plus [[Non-Random Two Liquid model|NRTL]] fit and [[extrapolation]] to different pressures]]
A lot of efforts are made to develop new and improved models for the calculation of properties. This includes for example the description of 
* thermophysical properties like [[vapor pressure]]s, [[viscosity|viscosities]], caloric data, etc. of pure components and mixtures
* properties of different apparatuses like reactors, distillation columns, pumps, etc.
* chemical reactions and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]]
* environmental and safety-related data

Two main different types of models can be distinguished:
# Rather simple equations and [[correlation]]s where parameters are fitted to experimental data.
# Predictive methods where properties are estimated.

The equations and correlations are normally preferred because they describe the property (almost) exactly. To obtain reliable parameters it is necessary to have experimental data which are usually obtained from factual data banks&lt;ref&gt;Marsh K., Satyro M.A., “Integration of Databases and their Impact on Process Simulation and Design”, Conference, Lake Tahoe, USA, 1994, 1-14, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wadsley M.W., “Thermochemical and Thermophysical Property Databases for Computational Chemical Process Simulation”, Conference, Korea, Seoul, August 30 - September 2, 1998, 253-256, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; or, if no data are publicly available, from [[measurement]]s. 

Using predictive methods is much cheaper than experimental work and also than data from data banks. Despite this big advantage predicted properties are normally only used in early steps of the process development to find first approximate solutions and to exclude wrong pathways because these estimation methods normally introduce higher errors than correlations obtained from real data. 

Process simulation also encouraged the further development of mathematical models in the fields of [[numerics]] and the solving of complex problems.&lt;ref&gt;Saeger R.B., Bishnoi P.R., “A Modified 'Inside-Out' Algorithm for Simulation of Multistage Multicomponent Separation Processes Using the UNIFAC Group-Contribution Method”, Can.J.Chem.Eng., 64, 759-767, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mallya J.U., Zitney S.E., Choudhary S., Stadtherr M.A., “Parallel Frontal Solver for Large-Scale Process Simulation and Optimization″, AIChE J., 43(4), 1032-1040, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of process simulation is strongly related to the development of the [[computer science]] and of computer hardware and programming languages. Early working simple implementations of partial aspects of chemical processes were introduced in the 1970s when suitable hardware and software (here mainly the programming languages [[FORTRAN]] and [[C (programming language)|C]]) became available. The modelling of chemical properties began much earlier, notably the cubic [[equation of state]]s and the [[Antoine equation]] were precursory developments of the 19th century.

== Steady state and dynamic process simulation ==
Initially process simulation was used to simulate [[steady state]] processes. Steady-state models perform a mass and energy balance of a stationary process (a process in an equilibrium state) it does not depend on time. 

Dynamic simulation is an extension of steady-state process simulation whereby time-dependence is built into the models via derivative terms i.e. accumulation of mass and energy. The advent of dynamic simulation means that the time-dependent description, prediction and control of real processes in real time has become possible. This includes the description of starting up and shutting down a plant, changes of conditions during a reaction, holdups, thermal changes and more.

Dynamic simulations require increased calculation time and are mathematically more complex than a steady state simulation. It can be seen as a multiply repeated steady state simulation (based on a fixed time step) with constantly changing parameters.

Dynamic simulation can be used in both an online and offline fashion. The online case being model predictive control, where the real-time simulation results are used to predict the changes that would occur for a control input change, and the control parameters are optimised based on the results. Offline process simulation can be used in the design, troubleshooting and optimisation of process plant as well as the conduction of case studies to assess the impacts of process modifications. Dynamic simulation is also used for [[Operator Training Simulator|operator training]].

'''RAF Fylingdales''' is a [[Royal Air Force]] station on Snod Hill in the [[North York Moors]], England. Its motto is "Vigilamus" (translates to "We are watching").&lt;ref name=":WG:"&gt;{{cite news|title=The changing faces of RAF Fylingdales|url=https://www.whitbygazette.co.uk/news/the-changing-faces-of-raf-fylingdales-1-6000187|accessdate=30 November 2017|work=The Whitby Gazette|date=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[radar]] [[Military base|base]] and is also part of the [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System]] (BMEWS). As part of intelligence-sharing arrangements between the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] (see, for example, the [[UKUSA Agreement]]), data collected at RAF Fylingdales are shared between the two countries. Its primary purpose is to give the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British]] and [[Federal government of the United States|US governments]] warning of an impending [[ballistic missile]] attack (part of the so-called [[four minute warning]] during the [[Cold War]]). A secondary role is the detection and tracking of orbiting objects; Fylingdales is part of the [[United States Space Surveillance Network]].&lt;ref name="yorkshirecnd.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://yorkshirecnd.org.uk/campaigns/fylingdales/|title=Fylingdales - Yorkshire Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|website=yorkshirecnd.org.uk|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmdfence/290-i/290ap13.htm|title=House of Commons - Defence - Appendices to the Minutes of Evidence|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/space/facility/fylingdales.htm|title=RAF Fylingdales|first=John|last=Pike|website=www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as its early-warning and space-tracking roles, Fylingdales has a third function - the Satellite Warning Service for the UK. It keeps track of spy satellites used by other countries, so that secret activities in the UK can be carried out when they are not overhead. The armed services, defence manufacturers and research organisations, including universities, take advantage of this facility.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/sites/f/fylingdales/|title=Subbrit: RSG: Sites: Fylingdales|website=www.subbrit.org.uk|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Cold War===
[[File:RAF Fylingdales golfballs 1989.jpg|thumb|The radomes at Fylingdales in 1986]]
[[File:Radar RAF Fylingdales.jpg|thumb|The Solid State Phased Array Radar (SSPAR)]]
The station was sited on a former wartime mortar range on Snod Hill, which had to be comprehensively cleared by [[No. 5131 (BD) Squadron RAF|RAF Bomb Disposal]] before building could begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=North York Moors early warning station marks anniversary|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/10678818.North_York_Moors_early_warning_station_marks_anniversary/|accessdate=30 November 2017|work=York Press|date=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":WG:" /&gt; The station was built by the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) in 1962, and was maintained by RCA (Great Britain), now [[Serco|Serco Group plc]]. RAF Fylingdales consisted of three {{convert|40|m|order=flip|adj=on}} diameter 'golfballs' or geodesic domes ([[radome]]s) containing mechanically steered [[radar]]. Operation of the Fylingdales Site transferred to [[RAF Fighter Command]] on 15 January 1964&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=plaque in the Tactical Operations Room |url=http://www.airfieldinformationexchange.org/community/archive/index.php/t-11099.html |accessdate=6 March 2014 |quote="This plaque commemorates the commissioning of Royal Air Force Fylingdales as Site III of the Balistic Missile Early Warning System on 17 September 1963 .

Between 1989 and 1992, [[Raytheon]], the US [[Defense contractor|defence contractor]], completed a contract that saw the domes replaced by the current tetrahedron ('pyramid') structure, housing the AESA phased array radar.

===National Missile Defense===
In the late 1990s, the United States decided to pursue a [[National Missile Defense]] plan fully, and RAF Fylingdales attracted further publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK ready to help 'Son of Star Wars'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2658861.stm|accessdate=30 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve tracking capabilities (for launches from [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]) the United States wanted the use of Fylingdales as part of its NMD network.  After receiving a formal request from the US, the British Government agreed to its use as an NMD tracking facility, in 2003. The decision was criticised, because the proposed NMD system was solely for US benefit.

A £449&amp;nbsp;million upgrade for RAF Fylingdales to become an NMD tracking facility is now underway by [[Boeing]], with [[Raytheon]] as the major subcontractor. It will replace many internal systems - computers, displays, etc - to improve resolution and tracking accuracy. No external changes are being made in direct relation to these upgrades and no power increases will occur.

According to the [[BBC]], ''[[The Independent]]'' reported that the British Government secretly agreed to a US request to station NMD missile interceptors at Fylingdales Moor in late 2004. This has subsequently been denied by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3750294.stm |title=MoD denies US missiles set for UK|work= [[BBC News Online]]|date= 17 October 2004|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health fears===
In June 2003, concern arose locally that RAF Fylingdales was emitting harmful emissions, after a possible [[cancer cluster]] was discovered around [[Cape Cod Air Force Station|a similar radar facility]] on [[Cape Cod]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Radiation fears about radar base|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/2954306.stm|accessdate=30 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=2 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The issue was investigated by the local [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] organisation, the Scarborough, Whitby and Ryedale [[Primary Care Trust]], and a report was released in December.  It concluded that there was no link between RAF Fylingdales and local cancer rates, nor any abnormal risk, as cancer rates in the immediate area proved to be normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/3244206.stm |title=No cancer link to base|work=BBC News|date=30 November 2003|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 MoD report on the impact of the NMD upgrade at RAF Fylingdales reiterated that the base was within health guidelines and would remain so.

==Operation==

===BMEWS===
While the radar station remains a British asset operated and commanded by the Royal Air Force, it also forms one of three stations in the United States BMEWS network (the United States also funds the cost of the radar units). The other two stations in the network are [[Thule Air Base]], [[Greenland]] and [[Clear Air Force Station]], [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name=":PS:"&gt;{{PastScape |num=1309868 |desc=RAF Fylingdales |access-date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data obtained by Fylingdales is shared fully and freely with the United States, where it feeds into the US-[[Canada|Canadian]] [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] at [[Peterson Air Force Base]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. To this end a [[United States Air Force]] liaison officer is stationed at the base.

The British Government advised in March 2018, that as of the beginning of that month, fewer than five [[United States Armed Forces|United States (US) military]] personnel and ten US contractors worked at the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2018-03-01/130642|title=USA: RAF Fylingdales:Written question - 130642|last=Lancaster|first=Mark|date=6 March 2018|website=UK Parliament|language=English|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems===
The primary radars of RAF Fylingdales are [[active electronically scanned array]] (AESA) phased array radars, mounted on each face of a truncated [[tetrahedron]], typically referred to as the "pyramid" or the SSPAR (Solid State Phased Array).&lt;ref name=":YP:" /&gt; This makes Fylingdales unique amongst its peers in that it covers a full 360 degrees. Each of the three arrays is {{convert|84|ft|adj=on}} across&lt;ref name=":PS:" /&gt; and contains around 2560 transmit/receive modules; mean power output is about {{nowrap|2.5 MW}}, with a tracking range of {{convert|3,000|nmi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/raffylingdales/aboutus/equipment.cfm |publisher=Ministry of Defence |title= RAF Fylingdales - Equipment|date= 4 May 2012|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
The functions of RAF Fylingdales have been subject to criticism from opposition groups, such as the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND), leading to [[protest]]s being held on occasion. These stem from concerns regarding the base's association with [[nuclear warfare]] and the [[militarisation of space]]. They argue against the UK assisting the US [[National Missile Defense]] (NMD) programme with RAF Fylingdales' ability to detect attacks, saying it is destabilising US and European relations with [[Russia]], makes the UK  the front line in any future conflict&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cnduk.org/cnd-calls-no-us-missile-defence-demo-fylingdales-radar-saturday/|title=CND calls 'No to US Missile Defence' demo at Fylingdales radar this Saturday - Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|date=9 June 2009|publisher=|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it could be information from Fylingdales that initiates a nuclear response from the US and/or the UK to a perceived threat – real or false; intended or accidental.&lt;ref name="yorkshirecnd.org.uk"/&gt; The radar beam has created serious concern of radiation risks due to leakage from the sides of the beams -“side lobes”. Although the radiation levels are within UK limits ([[NRPB]]), it would be harder for the base to keep within the tighter EU limits (INIRPB), which the UK may soon adopt.&lt;ref name="yorkshirecnd.org.uk"/&gt; 

The [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) defends the use and role of the facility, regarding RAF Fylingdales as part of the UK's contribution to counter a military threat. The MoD states that, although ballistic missile attack is a minor threat currently, this could change in the long-term future, if as-yet unknown enemies develop missiles as a means to overcome large distances to strike at the UK.

Another RAF Station, [[Menwith Hill|RAF Menwith Hill]], is also located in Yorkshire and has a close arrangement with the United States. It, too, has been the focus of protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US spy base protest ends|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1421374.stm|accessdate=30 November 2017|work=BBC News|date=4 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural reference===
The monitoring function is referred to in the [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] song "Fylingdale Flyer" which appears on the album ''[[A (Jethro Tull album)|A]]'' and in the ''[[Slipstream (video)|Slipstream]]'' video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cornick|first1=Scott Allen Nollen ; foreword by Ian Anderson ; afterword by David Pegg ; with the participation of Glenn|last2=Perry|first2=Doane|title=Jethro Tull : a history of the band, 1968-2001|date=2002|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=0-7864-1101-5|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Moore|editor1-first=Allan F.|title=Analyzing popular music|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Rammed earth is simple to manufacture, non-combustible, [[Thermal mass|thermally massive]], strong, and durable. However, structures such as walls can be laborious to construct of rammed earth without machinery, e. g., powered tampers, and they are susceptible to water damage if inadequately protected or maintained.

Edifices formed of rammed earth are on every continent except [[Antarctica]], in a range of environments including temperate, wet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-CAT-lecture-theatre.htm |title=Rammed Earth Lecture Theatre, CAT |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; semiarid desert, montane, and tropical regions. The availability of suitable soil and a [[architecture|building design]] appropriate for local [[climate|climatic conditions]] are the factors that favour its use.

==Composition and use==
{{Original research | section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Tapialdebarro.jpg|thumb|left|Model of construction of a wall of rammed earth on a foundation]]
Manufacturing rammed earth involves compressing a damp mixture of [[soil|earth]] that has suitable proportions of [[sand]], [[gravel]], [[clay]], and/or an added stabilizer into an externally supported frame or mold, forming either a solid wall or individual blocks. Historically, additives such as [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] or animal blood were used to stabilize it,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} while modern construction adds [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[cement]], or [[asphalt]] emulsions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} To add variety, some modern builders also add coloured oxides or other materials, e.g. bottles, tires, or pieces of timber.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The construction of an entire wall begins with a temporary frame, denominated the "[[formwork]]", which is usually made of wood or plywood, as a mold for the desired shape and dimensions of each section of wall. The form must be durable and well braced, and the two opposing faces must be clamped together to prevent bulging or deformation caused by the large compressing forces. Damp material is poured into the formwork to a depth of {{convert|10|to|25|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and then compacted to approximately 50% of its original height.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material is compressed iteratively, in batches or courses, so as to gradually erect the wall up to the top of the [[formwork]]. Tamping was historically manual with a long ramming pole, and was very laborious, but modern construction can be made less so by employing [[pneumatic]]ally powered tampers.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

[[File:Paderne Morrish Castle 26 Nov 2007 (6).JPG|thumb|right|Taipa fortifications at [[Paderne Castle]] in the Algarve, Portugal]]

After a wall is complete, it is sufficiently strong to immediately remove the formwork.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This is necessary if a surface texture is to be applied, e.g., by wire brushing, carving, or mold impression, because the walls become too hard to work after approximately one hour.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Construction is optimally done in warm weather so that the walls can dry and harden.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[compression strength]] of the rammed earth increases as it cures; some time is necessary for it to dry and as long as two years can be necessary for complete curing.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Exposed walls must be sealed to prevent water damage.

In modern variations of the technique, rammed-earth walls are constructed on top of conventional [[Foundation (architecture)|footings]] or a [[reinforced concrete]] slab base.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Where blocks made of rammed earth are used, they are generally stacked like regular blocks and are bonded together with a thin mud slurry instead of cement.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Special machines, usually powered by small engines and often portable, are used to compress the material into blocks.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Presently more than 30% of the world's population uses earth as a building material.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Rammed earth has been used globally in a wide range of climatic conditions.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed-earth housing may resolve homelessness caused by otherwise expensive construction techniques.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The [[compressive strength]] of rammed earth is a maximum of {{convert|4.3|MPa|psi|abbr=on}}. This is less than that of [[concrete]] but more than sufficiently strong for domestic edifices.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webs.ashlandctc.org/jnapora/hum-faculty/syllabi/trad.html |title=A Traditional Research Paper: Rammed Earth Construction |first=Robert O. |last=Cassell  |work=Ashland  Community  and Technical College|date= 17 December 2001 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, properly constructed rammed earth endures for thousands of years, as many ancient structures that are still standing around the world demonstrate.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rammedearthconstructions.com.au/index.php?mp_id=5 |title=BENEFITS OF BUILDING IN RAMMED EARTH |work=Rammed Earth Constructions |publisher=Rammed Earth Constructions P/L |location=[[Maleny]], [[Australia]] |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rammed earth reinforced with [[rebar]], wood, or [[bamboo]] can prevent collapse caused by earthquakes or heavy storms,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} because unreinforced edifices of rammed earth resist earthquake damage extremely poorly. See [[1960 Agadir earthquake]] for an example of the total destruction which may be inflicted on such structures by an earthquake. Adding cement to soil mixtures poor in clay can also increase the load-bearing capacity of rammed-earth edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] observed in 1925 that rammed-earth structures endure indefinitely and can be constructed for less than two-thirds of the cost of standard frame houses.&lt;ref name="USDA Farmer Bulletin 1500"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |title=Farmers' Bulletin No. 1500: Rammed Earth Walls for Buildings - Rammed Earth Books - The Boden Hauser |first1=Morris Cotgrave |last1=Betts |first2=Thomas Arrington Huntington |last2=Miller |work=The Boden Hauser |page=20 |date=May 1937 |origyear=1925 |accessdate=February 4, 2012 |oclc=600507592 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225224741/http://www.aaronhauser.com/rammed-earth-books/farmers-bulletin-no-1500-rammed-earth-walls-for-buildings/ |archivedate=February 25, 2012 |df= }} Originally published by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], Washington, DC, USA.

Soil is a widely available, inexpensive, and [[sustainable]] resource.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://earth.sustainablesources.com/#Soils |title=Soils for Rammed Earth, Caliche Block, and Soil Material Construction |publisher=Sustainable Sources |location=Austin, TX, USA| accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, construction with rammed earth is very viable.{{vague|date=July 2017|reason=Viable in what sense? Compared to what? Under which circumstances?}} Unskilled labour can do most of the necessary work.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; While the cost of rammed earth is low, rammed-earth construction without mechanical tools is very time-consuming and laborious; however, with a mechanical tamper and prefabricated [[formwork]] it can require only two or three days to construct the walls of a {{convert|200|to|220|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} house.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

One significant benefit of rammed earth is its high [[thermal mass]]: like [[brick]] or [[concrete]], it can absorb heat during daytime and nocturnally release it.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This action moderates daily temperature variations and reduces the need for [[air conditioning]] and [[heating]]. In colder climates, rammed-earth walls can be insulated with [[Styrofoam]] or a similar insert. It must also be protected from heavy rain and insulated with vapour barriers.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthstructures.com.au/rammed-earth-construction/ |title=Rammed Earth Construction |work=Earth Structures |location=Victoria, Australia |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can effectively regulate humidity if unclad walls containing clay are exposed to an internal space. Humidity is regulated between 40% and 60%, which is the ideal range for [[asthma]] sufferers{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} and for the storage of susceptible objects such as books.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The material mass and clay content of rammed earth allows an edifice to breathe more than concrete edifices, which avoids problems of condensation but prevents significant loss of heat.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Untouched, rammed-earth walls have the colour and texture of natural earth. Moisture-impermeable finishes, such as cement render, are avoided because they impair the ability of a wall to desorb moisture,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which quality is necessary to preserve its strength.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Well-cured walls accept nails and screws easily, and can be effectively patched with the same material used to build them.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Blemishes can be repaired using the soil mixture as a plaster and sanded smooth.

The thickness, typically {{convert|30|to|35|cm|in}}, and [[density]] of rammed-earth walls make them suitable for [[soundproofing]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} They are also inherently [[fireproof]], resistant to [[termite]] damage, and non-toxic.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Environmental effects and sustainability ==

[[File:rammed earth.jpg|thumb|left|Rammed-earth [[trombe wall]] constructed by [[Design Build Bluff]]]]

Edifices of rammed earth are thought{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly than popular techniques of construction. Because rammed-earth edifices use locally available materials, they usually have low [[embodied energy]] and generate very little waste.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The soils used are typically [[subsoil]]s low in [[clay]], between 5% and 15%,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} which conserve the [[topsoil]] for agriculture. When the soil excavated in preparation for a foundation can be used, the cost and energy consumption of transportation are minimal.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; Rammed earth is probably the least environmentally detrimental construction material and technique that is readily and commercially available today to construct solid masonry edifices.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth has potentially low manufacturing impact, contingent on the amount of cement and the amount that is locally sourced; it is often quarried aggregates rather than "earth".

[[Formwork]] is removable and can be reused, reducing the need for lumber.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/ceb.html |title=Natural Building Colloquium: Compressed Earth Blocks |first=Wayne |last=Nelson |publisher=NetWorks Productions |date=21 May 2003 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mixing cement with the soil can counteract sustainable benefits such as low embodied energy and humidity regulation because manufacture of the cement itself adds to the global carbon dioxide burden at a rate of 1.25 tonnes per tonne of cement produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rammedearthconsulting.com/rammed-earth-cement-co2.htm |title=Rammed Earth – Pollution and Cement |first=Rowland |last=Keable  |work=Rammed Earth Consulting |location=London, England, UK |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial substitution of cement with alternatives such as [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]] has not been demonstrated to be effective, and implicates other questions of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |title=Ground Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |location=Washington, DC, USA |date=7 April 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122083859/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/ggbfs.htm |archivedate=22 January 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammed earth can contribute to the overall energy efficiency of edifices: the density, thickness, and thermal conductivity of rammed earth render it an especially suitable material for [[passive solar]] heating. Warmth requires almost 12 hours to be conducted through a wall {{convert|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Rammed-earth construction may also reduce the ecological impacts of [[deforestation]] and the toxicity of artificial materials associated with conventional construction techniques.

Although it has low [[greenhouse emission]]s in theory, [[transportation]] and the production of [[cement]] can add significantly to the overall emissions of modern rammed earth construction. The most basic kind of traditional rammed earth has very low greenhouse gas emissions but the more engineered and processed variant of rammed earth has the potential for significant emissions.

== History ==
[[File:JiayuguanWall.jpg|thumb|right|A ''taipa'' section of the [[Great Wall of China]]]]
[[File:Grange.Bassey.Saint.Nicolas.Macherin.jpg|thumb|right|Rammed-earth edifice on a farm in [[France]]]]

Evidence of ancient use of rammed earth has been found in [[Neolithic]] archaeological  sites of the [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] and [[Longshan culture|Longshan]] cultures along the [[Yellow River]] in [[China]], dating to 5000 BCE. By 2000 BCE, rammed-earth architectural techniques (夯土 ''Hāng tǔ'') were commonly used for walls and foundations in [[China]].&lt;ref name="Xujie Liu"&gt;{{cite book |last=Xujie |first=Liu  |editor1-first=Nancy Shatzman |editor1-last=Steinhardt  |display-authors=etal  |title=Chinese Architecture |publisher=New Haven, CT, USA: Yale University Press and Beijing, China: New World Press |date=2002 |pages = 12–14, 21–2 |oclc=186413872 |isbn=978-0-300-09559-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1800s, rammed earth was popularized in the [[United States]] by the book ''Rural Economy'' by S. W. Johnson. The technique was used to construct the [[Borough House Plantation]]&lt;ref name="Borough House"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743001/ |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Borough House Plantation, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, vicinity of Stateburg) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, SC, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=20 April 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of the Holy Cross (Stateburg, South Carolina)|Church of the Holy Cross]]&lt;ref name="Church of the Holy Cross"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/sumter/S10817743002/index.htm |title=National Register Properties in South Carolina: Church of the Holy Cross, Sumter County (SC Hwy 261, Stateburg vicinity) |publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History |location=Columbia, South Carolina, USA |work=National Register Sites in South Carolina |date=April 20, 2009 |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Stateburg, South Carolina]], both being [[National Historic Landmarks]].

Johnson}}
An outstanding example of a rammed-earth edifice in [[Canada]] is [[St. Thomas Anglican Church (Shanty Bay, Ontario)|St. Thomas Anglican Church]] in [[Shanty Bay]], [[Ontario]], erected between 1838 and 1841.

From the 1920s through the 1940s rammed-earth construction in the US was studied. [[South Dakota State College]] extensively researched and constructed almost one hundred weathering walls of rammed earth.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} For over 30 years the college investigated the use of paints and plasters in relation to colloids in soil. In 1945, Clemson Agricultural College of [[South Carolina]] published the results of their research of rammed earth in a pamphlet titled "Rammed Earth Building Construction".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1936, on a homestead near [[Gardendale, Alabama]], the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] constructed an experimental community of rammed-earth edifices with architect Thomas Hibben.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The houses were inexpensively constructed and were sold to the public along with sufficient land for gardens and small plots for livestock. The project successfully provided valuable homes to low-income families.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

The [[US Agency for International Development]] is working with [[undeveloped countries]] to improve the engineering of rammed-earth houses.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} It also financed the authorship of the ''Handbook of Rammed Earth''&lt;ref name="Handbook For Building Homes of Earth"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wolfskill |first1=Lyle A. |last2=Dunlap |first2= Wayne A. |last3=Gallaway |first3=Bob M. |title=Handbook For Building Homes of Earth |url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAE689.pdf |publisher=[[Texas Transportation Institute]] |location=College Station, Texas, USA |work=Texas Transportation Institute bulletin |number=21 |edition=1453 |accessdate=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and the [[Texas Transportation Institute]]. The ''Handbook'' was unavailable for purchase by the public until the Rammed Earth Institute International gained permission to reprint it.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt;

Interest in rammed earth declined after [[World War II]] when the cost of modern construction materials decreased.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Rammed earth was considered substandard, and still is opposed by many contractors, engineers, and tradesmen who are unfamiliar with earthen construction techniques.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; The prevailing perception that such materials and techniques perform poorly in regions prone to earthquakes has prevented their use in much of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In [[Chile]], for example, rammed earth edifices normally cannot be conventionally insured against damage or even be approved by the government.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

A notable example of 21st century use of rammed earth is the façade of the [[Nk'Mip Desert Cultural Centre]] in southern [[British Columbia]], Canada. As of 2014 it is the largest rammed earth wall in [[North America]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''Reef Life Survey''' is a marine life monitoring programme&lt;ref name = RLS &gt;Staff, RLS website home page http://reeflifesurvey.com/&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Hobart, Tasmania|Hobart]], [[Tasmania]]. It is international in scope, but predominantly [[Australian]], as a large proportion of the volunteers are Australian. Most of the surveys are done by volunteer [[Recreational diver training|recreational divers]], collecting [[biodiversity]] data for [[marine conservation]]. The database is available to [[marine ecology]] researchers, and is used by several [[marine protected area]] managements in Australia,&lt;ref name=Parks /&gt;&lt;ref name=Naturalresources /&gt; New Zealand, American Samoa and the eastern Pacific.

==Function==

Reef Life Survey provides data to improve biodiversity conservation and the sustainable management of marine resources. They collect and curate biodiversity information at spatial and temporal scales beyond those possible by most scientific dive teams which have to work with limited resources, by using volunteer recreational divers trained in the RLS survey procedures.&lt;ref name = RLS /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gertz 2014" /&gt; The [[University of Tasmania]] houses and manages the RLS database, and the data is freely available to the public for non-profit purposes through public outputs, including their website.

==History==

Reef Life Survey was started by researchers at the University of Tasmania and initially funded by the [[Commonwealth Environment Research Facilities]] (CERF) Program. This program is the core activity of the Reef Life Survey Foundation Incorporated – a not for profit Australian organisation.&lt;ref name = RLS /&gt;

==Personnel==

Reef Life Survey includes a volunteer network of recreational [[Scuba diving|scuba divers]], trained in the relevant skills, and an Advisory Committee. The advisory committee is made up of managers and scientists who use the collected data, and representatives of the recreational diver network.&lt;ref name="RLS website" /&gt;

==Procedures==
[[File:Diver swimming a transect for Reef Life Survey PB164699.JPG|thumb|Diver swimming a transect for Reef Life Survey]]
Standard survey procedures are used matched to a variety of habitat [[topographies]], and using simple equipment - waterproof clipboard with records sheet, [[underwater camera]], and 50m surveyor's tape measure. The surveys are typically repeated at irregular intervals at listed sites, identified by [[GPS]] location, [[transect]] depth and direction, and are usually conducted as a pair of transects in opposite directions from the nominal position, at approximately constant depth. Data collected includes fish counts by visual census in a 5m x 5m corridor on both sides of the transect line (Method 1), mobile [[invertebrate]] counts in a 1m corridor on both sides of the line (Method 2), and photo-quadrats at 2.5m intervals along the 50m transect line. Manufactured debris may also be recorded. Off transect observations of interest are recorded separately (Method 0). Numbers and size class are recorded for fish, just numbers for most invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Methods Manual" /&gt;

==Data==
Since 2006, divers have collected data for RLS from over 44 countries. As of September 2015, more than 4500 species have been recorded from over 7000 surveys.

==Expeditions==

A [[circumnavigation]] of Australia by volunteer citizen scientists aboard the sailing [[catamaran]] Reef Dragon left [[Port Davey, Tasmania|Port Davey]], Tasmania, on February 16, 2013 on an counterclockwise journey around the continent of Australia and ended in February 2014 in [[Prince of Wales Bay]], Hobart. During the voyage a marine baseline of reef biodiversity for the new [[Commonwealth Coral Sea Marine Reserve]] network was established.&lt;ref name="Mounster 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Darby 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="U Tas" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1782">The '''refinement calculus''' is a formalized approach to stepwise [[program refinement|refinement]] for program construction. The required behaviour of the final executable program is specified as an abstract and perhaps non-executable "program", which is then refined by a series of correctness-preserving transformations into an efficiently executable program.

Proponents include [[Ralph-Johan Back]], who originated the approach in his 1978 PhD thesis ''On the Correctness of Refinement Steps in Program Development'', and [[Carroll_Morgan_(academic)|Carroll Morgan]], especially with his book ''[http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/publications/books/PfS/ Programming from Specifications]'' (Prentice Hall, 2nd edition, 1994, {{ISBN|0-13-123274-6}}). In the latter case, the motivation was to link [[Jean-Raymond Abrial|Abrial]]'s specification notation [[Z notation|Z]], via a rigorous relation of behaviour-preserving [[program refinement]], to an executable programming notation based on [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|Dijkstra]]'s language of [[guarded commands]]. ''Behaviour-preserving'' in this case means that any [[Hoare triple]] satisfied by a program should also be satisfied by any refinement of it, which notion leads directly to ''[http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~mjb/refcalc-tut/home.html#morgan specification statements]'' as pre- and postconditions standing, on their own, for any program that could soundly be placed between them.

{{good article}}
{{Economic systems sidebar}}
A '''Robinson Crusoe economy''' is a simple framework used to study some fundamental issues in economics.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; It assumes an economy with one consumer, one producer and two goods. The title "[[Robinson Crusoe]]" is a reference to the novel of the same name authored by [[Daniel Defoe]] in 1719.

As a thought experiment in economics, many international trade economists have found this simplified and idealized version of the story important due to its ability to simplify the complexities of the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of [[consumer behaviour]], producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in [[public finance]] the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of [[public goods]] and certain aspects of collective benefits.&lt;ref name="pubfin"/&gt; It is used in [[growth economics]] to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.&lt;ref name="barro"/&gt;

In the Robinson Crusoe economy, there is only one individual – Robinson Crusoe himself. He acts both as a producer to maximise profits, as well as consumer to maximise his utility.&lt;ref name="RMS"/&gt; The possibility of trade can be introduced by adding another person to the economy. This person is Crusoe's friend, [[Man Friday]]. Although in the novel he plays the role of Crusoe's servant, in the Robinson Crusoe economy he is considered as another actor with equal decision making abilities as Crusoe. Along with this, conditions of [[Pareto Efficiency]] can be analysed by bringing in the concept of the [[Edgeworth box]].&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The basic assumptions of the Robinson Crusoe economy are as follows:&lt;ref name="cowell"/&gt; 
# The island is cut off from the rest of the world (and hence cannot trade)
# There is only a single economic agent (Crusoe himself)
# All commodities on the island have to be produced or found from existing stocks

==Framework==
[[File:Income Leisure Preference in a Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|left|400px|alt=The Robinson Crusoe Economy framework|Figure 1: Income Leisure Preference in a Robinson Crusoe Economy.]]
Robinson Crusoe is assumed to be shipwrecked on a deserted island. Similar to the choices that households (suppliers of labour) face, Crusoe has only two activities to participate in – earn income or pass his time in leisure.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The income generating activity in this case is gathering coconuts.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; As usual, the more time he spends in leisure, the less food he has to eat, and conversely, the more time he spends gathering coconuts, the less time he has for leisure. This is depicted in figure 1.
{{Clear }}

==Production function and indifference curves==
Crusoe's [[indifference curves]] depict his preferences for leisure and coconuts while the [[production function]] depicts the technological relationship between how much he works and how many coconuts he gathers. If the axes depicting coconut collection and leisure are reversed and plotted with Crusoe's indifference map and production function,&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; figure 2 can be drawn:

[[File:The Robinson Crusoe Economy's Production Function and Indifference Curves.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Figure 2: The Robinson Crusoe Economy's Production Function and Indifference Curves]]

The production function is [[Concave function|concave]] in two dimensions and [[Quasiconvex function|quasi-convex]] in three dimensions. This means that the longer Robinson works, the more coconuts he will be able to gather. But due to diminishing marginal returns of labour, the additional number of coconuts he gets from every additional hour of labour is declining.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The point at which Crusoe will reach an equilibrium between the number of hours he works and relaxes can be found out when the highest indifference curve is tangent to the production function.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; This will be Crusoe's most preferred point provided the technology constraint is given and cannot be changed. At this equilibrium point, the slope of the highest indifference curve must equal the slope of the production function.

Recall that the [[Marginal rate of substitution]] is the rate at which a consumer is ready to give up one good in exchange for another good while maintaining the same level of utility.&lt;ref name="P and R"/&gt; Additionally, an input's marginal product  is the extra output that can be produced by using one more unit of the input, assuming that the quantities of no other inputs to production change.&lt;ref name="P and R"/&gt; Then,

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt;'''

where,

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = Marginal Product of Labour,''' and

'''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = Marginal rate of substitution between Leisure and Coconuts'''

{{Clear}}

==Crusoe's multifaceted role==
Suppose Crusoe decides to stop being a producer and consumer simultaneously. He decides he will produce one day and consume the next. His two roles of consumer and producer are being split up and studied separately to understand the elementary form of consumer theory and producer theory in microeconomics. For dividing his time between being a consumer and producer, he must set up two [[collectively exhaustive]] markets, the coconut market and the labour market.&lt;ref name="RMS" /&gt; He also sets up a firm, of which he becomes the sole [[shareholder]]. The firm will want to maximise profits by deciding how much labour to hire and how many coconuts to produce according to their prices. As a worker of the firm, Crusoe will collect wages, as a shareholder, he will collect profits and as a consumer, he will decide how much of the firm's output to purchase according to his income and the prevailing market prices.&lt;ref name="RMS" /&gt; Let's assume that a currency called "Dollars" has been created by Robinson to manage his finances. For simplicity, assume that '''Price&lt;sub&gt;Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = $1.00'''. This assumption is made to make the calculations in the numerical example easy because the inclusion of prices will not alter the result of the analysis. For more details, refer to [[Numéraire]] commodities.

===Producer===
{{Main|Production theory}}

[[File:Profit Maximising Condition for the firm in the Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Figure 3: Profit Maximising Condition for the firm in the Robinson Crusoe Economy]]

Assume that when the firm produces ''C'' amount of total coconuts, &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; represents its profit level. Also assume that when the wage rate at which the firm employs labour is ''w'', L amount of labour will be employed. Then,

&lt;math&gt;\Pi=C - wL \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C=\Pi + wL \,&lt;/math&gt;

The above function describes iso-profit lines (the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of combinations between labour and coconuts that produce a constant profit of Π). Profits can be maximised when the marginal product of labour equals the wage rate (marginal cost of production).&lt;ref name="TN" /&gt; Symbolically,

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

Graphically, the iso-profit line must be tangent to the production function.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

The vertical intercept of the iso-profit line measures the level of profit that Robinson Crusoe's firm will make. This level of profit, Π, has the ability to purchase Π dollars worth of coconuts. Since '''Price&lt;sub&gt;Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt;''' is $1.00, Π number of coconuts can be purchased. Also, the firm will declare a [[dividend]] of Π dollars. This will be given to the firm's sole shareholder, Crusoe himself.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

{{Clear }}

===Consumer===
{{Main|Consumer choice}}

[[File:Robinson Crusoe's Maximisation Problem showing his budget line and indifference curve.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Figure 4: Robinson Crusoe's Maximisation Problem showing his budget line and indifference curve]]

As a consumer, Crusoe will have to decide how much to work (or indulge in leisure) and hence consume.&lt;ref name="TN" /&gt; He can choose to not work at all, since he has an endowment of Π dollars from being a shareholder.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;  Let us instead consider the more realistic case of him deciding to work for a few hours. His labour consumption choice can be illustrated in figure 4:

Note that labour is assumed to be a '[[bad (economics)|bad]]', i.e., a commodity that a consumer doesn't like. Its presence in his consumption basket lowers the utility he derives.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; On the other hand, coconuts are goods. This is why the indifference curves are positively sloped. The maximum amount of labour is indicated by L'. The distance from L' to the chosen supply of labour (L*) gives Crusoe's demand for leisure.

Notice Crusoe's budget line. It has a slope of ''w'' and passes through the point '''(0,Π)'''. This point is his endowment level i.e., even when he supplies 0 amount of labour, he has Π amount of coconuts (dollars) to consume. Given the wage rate, Crusoe will choose how much to work and how much to consume at that point where,

'''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

{{Clear }}

==Equilibrium==

[[File:Equilibrium in both production and consumption in the Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Figure 5: Equilibrium in both production and consumption in the Robinson Crusoe Economy]]

At equilibrium, the demand for coconuts will equal the supply of coconuts and the demand for labour will equal the supply of labour.&lt;ref name="RMS" /&gt;

Graphically this occurs when the diagrams under consumer and producer are superimposed.&lt;ref name="TN" /&gt; Notice that,

'''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

'''MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w'''''

-=&gt; '''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Leisure, Coconuts&lt;/sub&gt; = MP&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'''

This ensures that the slopes of the indifference curves and the production set are the same.

As a result, Crusoe ends up consuming at the same point he would have if he made all the above decisions together. In other words, using the market system has the same outcome as choosing the individual utility maximisation and cost minimisation plans.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; This is an important result when put into a macro level perspective because it implies that there exists a set of prices for inputs and outputs in the economy such that the profit-maximising behaviour of firms along with the utility-maximizing actions of individuals results in the demand for each good equaling the supply in all markets. This means that a
competitive equilibrium can exist. The merit of a competitive equilibrium is that an efficient allocation of resources is achievable.&lt;ref name="HRV"/&gt; In other words, no economic agent can be made better off without making another economic agent worse off.&lt;ref name="vijay"/&gt;

==Production possibilities with two goods==
{{Main|Production-possibility frontier}}
Let's assume that there is another commodity that Crusoe can produce apart from coconuts, for example, fish. Now, Robinson has to decide how much time to spare for both activities, i.e. how many coconuts to gather and how many fish to hunt.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; The locus of the various combinations of fish and coconuts that he can produce from devoting different amounts of time to each activity is known as the production possibilities set.&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; This is depicted in the figure 6:

[[File:Production Possibilities Set in Robinson Crusoe Economy with two commodities.jpg|thumb|left|400px|alt=Production possibilities with two goods|Figure 6: Production possibilities set in the Robinson Crusoe economy with two commodities.]]

The boundary of the production possibilities set is known as the Production-possibility frontier (PPF).&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; This curve measures the feasible outputs that Crusoe can produce, with a fixed technological constraint and given amount of resources. In this case, the resources and technological constraints are Robinson Crusoe's labour.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

It is crucial to note that the shape of the PPF depends on the nature of the technology in use.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CD" /&gt; Here, technology refers to the type of [[returns to scale]] prevalent. In figure 6, the underlying assumption is the usual decreasing returns to scale, due to which the PPF is concave to the origin. In case we assumed increasing returns to scale, say if Crusoe embarked upon a mass production movement and hence faced decreasing costs, the PPF would be convex to the origin. The PPF is linear with a downward slope in two circumstances:
# If the technology for gathering coconuts and hunting fish exhibits constant returns to scale
# If there is only one input in production

So in the Robinson Crusoe economy, the PPF will be linear due to the presence of only one input.

===Marginal rate of transformation===
{{Main|Marginal rate of transformation}}
Suppose that Crusoe can produce 4 pounds of fish or 8 pounds of coconuts per hour. If he devotes L&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; hours to fish gathering and L&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; hours to gathering coconuts, he will produce 4L&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; pounds of fish and 8L&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; pounds of coconuts. Suppose that he decides to work for 12 hours a day. Then the production possibilities set will consist of all combinations of fish, F, and coconuts, C, such that

&lt;math&gt;F=4L_f \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C=8L_c \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L_f + L_c=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Solve the first two equations and substitute in the third to get,

&lt;math&gt;F/4 + C/8=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

This equation represents Crusoe's PPF. The slope of this PPF measures the [[Marginal rate of transformation]] (MRT), i.e., how much of the first good must be given up in order to increase the production of the second good by one unit. If Crusoe works one hour less on hunting fish, he will have 4 less fish. If he devotes this extra hour to collecting coconuts, he will have 8 extra coconuts. The MRT is thus,

'''MRT &lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;'''
&lt;math&gt;={\Delta C \over{\Delta F}} \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;= -8/4=-2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

===Comparative advantage===
{{Main|Comparative advantage}}
Under this section, the possibility of trade is introduced by adding another person to the economy. Suppose that the new worker who is added to the Robinson Crusoe Economy has different skills in gathering coconuts and hunting fish.&lt;ref name="JADM" /&gt; The second person is called "Friday".

Friday can produce 8 pounds of fish or 4 pounds of coconuts per hour. If he too decides to work for 12 hours, his production possibilities set will be determined by the following relations:

&lt;math&gt;F=8L_f \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C=4L_c \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L_f + L_c=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=&gt;F/8 + C/4=12 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,''' MRT &lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;''' 
&lt;math&gt;={\Delta C \over{\Delta F}} \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; &lt;math&gt;= -4/8=-1/2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

This means that for every pound of coconuts Friday gives up, he can produce 2 more pounds of fish.

So, we can say that Friday has a Comparative advantage &lt;ref name="JADM" /&gt; in hunting fish while Crusoe has a comparative advantage in gathering coconuts. Their respective PPFs can be shown in the following diagram:

[[File:Joint production possibilities in the Robinson Crusoe Economy.jpg|thumb|right|550px|500px|alt=Comparative Advantage||Figure 7: Joint production possibilities in the Robinson Crusoe economy.]]

The joint production possibilities set at the extreme right shows the total amount of both commodities that can be produced by Crusoe and Friday together. It combines the best of both workers.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt; If both of them work to gather coconuts only, the economy will have 144 coconuts in all, 96 from Crusoe and 48 from Friday. (This can be obtained by setting F=0 in their respective PPF equations and summing them up). Here the slope of the joint PPF is -1/2.

If we want more fish, we should shift that person who has a comparative advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, the slope of the joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;
{{clear}}

==Pareto efficiency==
{{Main|Pareto efficiency}}
Assume that there are '''''c''''' units of coconut and '''''f''''' units of fish available for consumption in the Crusoe Friday economy. Given this endowment bundle '''''(c,f)''''', the Pareto efficient bundle can be determined at the mutual tangency of Crusoe's and Friday's indifference curves in the [[Edgeworth box]] along the Pareto Set ([[Contract curve]]). These are the bundles at which Crusoe's and Friday's [[Marginal rate of substitution]] are equal.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;
In a simple exchange economy, the contract curve describes the set of bundles that exhaust the gains from trade. But in a Robinson Crusoe/Friday economy, there is another way to exchange goods – to produce less of one good and more of the other.&lt;ref name="RMS"/&gt;

[[File:Production Possibilities Set in Robinson Crusoe Economy and the Edgeworth Box.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Figure 8: Production Possibilities Set in Robinson Crusoe Economy and the Edgeworth Box showing a Pareto Efficient situation within]]

From the figure 8, it is clear that an economy operating at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be [[Pareto efficient]]. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts for fish is different from the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, there is a way to make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.&lt;ref name="HRV" /&gt;

Thus for Pareto Efficiency,

'''''MRT &lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = '''''MRS&lt;sub&gt;Coconuts, Fish&lt;/sub&gt;''''' &lt;ref name="CD"/&gt;

(''for both Crusoe and Friday'')

This can be achieved in a competitive market by decentralising production and consumption decisions, i.e. Crusoe and Friday will both solve their own problems of how much to consume and produce independently.&lt;ref name="TN"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23365">The '''sleeper effect''' is a psychological phenomenon that relates to persuasion. It is a delayed increase of the effect of a message that is accompanied by a discounting cue.
[[Image:Sleeper Effect.jpg|thumb|right|Figure A: Normal Decay&lt;br /&gt;Figure B: Sleeper Effect]]

==The sleeper effect==
When people are exposed normally to a persuasive message (such as an engaging or persuasive television advertisement), their attitudes toward the advocacy of the message display a significant increase.

Over time, however, their newly formed attitudes seem to gravitate back toward the opinion held prior to receiving the message, almost as if they were never exposed to the communication.  This pattern of normal decay in attitudes has been documented as the most frequently observed longitudinal pattern of persuasion research (Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993).

In contrast, some messages are often accompanied with a discounting cue (e.g., a message disclaimer, a low-credibility source) that would arouse a recipient’s suspicion of the validity of the message and suppress any attitude change that might occur by exposure to the message alone.  Furthermore, when people are exposed to a persuasive message followed by a discounting cue, people tend to be more persuaded over time; this is referred to as the sleeper effect (Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951; Cook &amp; Flay, 1978).

For example, in [[political campaign]]s during important elections, [[Swing vote|undecided voters]] often see negative advertisements about a party or candidate for office.  At the end of the advertisement, they also might notice that the opposing candidate paid for the advertisement.  Presumably, this would make voters question the truthfulness of the advertisement, and consequently, they may not be persuaded initially.  However, even though the source of the advertisement lacked credibility, voters will be more likely to be persuaded later (and ultimately, vote against the candidate disfavored by the advertisement).

This pattern of attitude change has puzzled social psychologists for nearly half a century, primarily due to its counter-intuitive nature and for its potential to aid in understanding attitude processes (Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993).  It has been a very widely studied phenomenon of persuasion research (Kumkale &amp; Albarracín, 2004; see also Cook &amp; Flay, 1978).
Despite a long history, the sleeper effect has been notoriously difficult to obtain 
or to replicate, with the exception of a pair of studies by Gruder et al. (1978).

== Controversy about the existence of a "sleeper effect" ==
One of the more challenging aspects that the sleeper effect posed to some researchers in early studies was the sheer difficulty of obtaining the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Capon|first=N|author2=J. Hulbert |title=The Sleeper Effect - An awakening.|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1973|doi=10.1086/268097|volume=37|page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sleeper effect is controversial because the influence of a persuasive communication is greater when one measures the effect closer to the presentation instead of farther from the time of the reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=TD|author2=BR FLay |title=The persistence of experimentally induced attitude change|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=Ah|author2=S. Chaiken |title=The psychology of attitudes|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After attempting to replicate the effect and failing, some researchers suggested that it might be better to accept the [[null hypothesis]] and conclude that the sleeper effect does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillig|first=PM|author2=AG Greenwald |title=Is it time to lay the sleeper effect to rest?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1974|doi=10.1037/h0035744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sleeper effect is involved with initial message impression so the phenomenon has implications for models of persuasion, including teaching methods, as well as more recent conceptualizations, such as the [[heuristic-systematic model]] and the [[elaboration likelihood model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumkale|first=G. Tarcan|author2=Dolores Albarracín |title=The Sleeper Effect in Persuasion: A Meta-Analytic Review|date=23 May 2011|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.1.143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Cook and his associates responded by suggesting that previous studies failed to obtain the sleeper effect because the requirements for a strong test were not met.  Specifically, they argued that the sleeper effect will occur only if:
:(a) the message is persuasive;
:(b) the discounting cue has a strong enough effect to suppress initial attitude change;
:(c) enough time has elapsed between immediate and delayed post-tests; and
:(d) the message itself still has an effect on attitudes during the delayed post-test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=TD|author2=CL Gruder |author3=KM Hennigan |author4=BR Flay |title=History of the Sleeper Effect: Some Logical Pitfalls in Accepting the Null Hypothesis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1979|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.86.4.662 |volume=86 |pages=662–679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental studies conducted did, in fact, provide evidence for the sleeper effect occurring under such theoretically relevant conditions.  Furthermore, the sleeper effect did not occur when any of the four requirements were not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruder|first=CL|author2=TD Cook |author3=KM Hennigan |author4=BR Flay |author5=C Alessis |author6=J Halamaj |title=Empirical tests of the absolute sleeper effect predicted from the discounting-cue hypothesis.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1978|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.36.10.1061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the dissociation interpretation, a sleeper effect appears to happen when a convincing message is conferred with a discounting cue (such as a low-credible source or counterargument). A sleeper effect occurs because of an impulsive dissociation of a message and a discounting cue over time (contrasting to a simple forgetting of a source).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratkanis|first=Anthony R. |author2=Leippe |author3=Greenwald |author4=Baumgardner|title=In Search of Reliable Persuasion Effects: The Sleeper Effect is Dead. Long Live the Sleeper Effect|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1988|volume=54| doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.2.203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First identified==
The sleeper effect was first identified in U.S. soldiers during World War II, after attempts to change their opinions and morals. Hovland et al. measured the soldier’s opinions five days or nine weeks after they were shown a movie presentation of army propaganda.  It was found that the difference in opinions of those who had observed the army propaganda movie and those who did not watch the movie were greater nine weeks after viewing it than five days.  The difference in delayed persuasion is (which Hovland et al. termed) the sleeper effect, where there was a significant increase of persuasion in the experimental group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumkale|first=G. Tarcan|author2=Dolores Albarracín |title=The Sleeper Effect in Persuasion: A Meta-Analytic Review|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first efforts to justify the effect were consistent with the understanding of persuasion processes at that time.  Hovland and his colleagues introduced a program of research to study how recall of the message and the source persuaded the sleeper effect.  They first hypothesized that message receivers forget the noncredible communicator as time goes by, and therefore the initial message rejection diminishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hovland|first=CL|author2=W Weiss |title=The Influence of Source Credibility on Communication Effectiveness.|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1951|doi=10.1086/266350|volume=15|page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, they later propositioned that message receivers may not entirely forget the cue, yet the association between the representations of the discounting cue and the message content may fade over time and produce a sleeper effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hovland|first=CL|author2=W Weiss |title=The Influence of Source Credibility on Communication Effectiveness.|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1951|doi=10.1086/266350|volume=15|page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two formulations vary in that (a) '''forgetting''' suggests that the traces of the cue disappear or become unavailable in memory over time, while (b) '''dissociation''' suggests that cue remains available in memory but is simply less easily retrieved (less accessible) in relation to the topic of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumkale|first=G. Tarcan|author2=Dolores Albarracin |title=The Sleeper Effect in Persuasion: A Meta-Analytic Review|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses on how the sleeper effect occurs==
Because the sleeper effect has been considered to be counter-intuitive, researchers since the early 1950s have attempted to explain how and why it occurs.
[[Image:Sleeper Effect2.jpg|thumb|right|Figure A: Forgetting&lt;br /&gt;Figure B: Dissociation&lt;br /&gt;Figure C: Differential-Decay]]

===Forgetting and dissociation===
According to the forgetting hypothesis, a discounting cue associated with a message initially decreases acceptance of the message. As time goes by, one may observe a delayed increase of persuasion if the recipient forgets the cue but recalls the merits of the message (Hovland et al., 1949). To test this hypothesis, Hovland and his colleagues (Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951; Kelman &amp; Hovland, 1953; Weiss, 1953) initiated a series of experiments in which participants received messages attributed to either trustworthy or untrustworthy sources and then completed measures of opinions as well as of recall of the message content and the source. Overall, messages with credible sources produced greater initial persuasion than messages delivered by non credible sources.

[[Carl Hovland|Hovland]], Lumsdaine, and Sheffield (1949) first discovered the effect by a well-known study that demonstrated the delayed impact of a [[World War II]] [[propaganda film|propaganda movie]] on American soldiers.

With a subset of conditions that caused participants to question the credibility of the source in the movie, participants later reported a slight increase of persuasion (much to the researchers’ surprise). After examining the results, they initially hypothesized that forgetting of the discounting cue (in this case, the non-credible source) was causing the effect. Over time, however, the effect of the messages presented by credible sources decayed, whereas the effect of the messages presented by non-credible sources either remained the same or increased slightly. Despite evidence for the sleeper effect from this series of studies, the recall measures indicated that recipients could still remember the non-credible sources of the messages at the time of the delayed follow-up.

This is when the forgetting hypothesis was replaced by the dissociation hypothesis. Now according to the dissociation hypothesis the sleeper effect does not need to imply that the discounting cue becomes permanently unavailable in memory. A weakened association between the cue and the message may be sufficient for the sleeper effect to occur. As the association weakens over time, rendering the cue less accessible in relation to the communication topic, there may be a delayed increase in persuasion as long as the message arguments are still memorable. To this extent, factors that facilitate retention of the message content should create settings conducive to the sleeper effect.

According to this reasoning, the sleeper effect occurs because the association between the discounting cue and the message in one’s memory becomes weakened over time; hence, when the message is recalled for purposes of producing an attitude, the source is not readily associated.

===Differential decay===

Something that Hovland and his team ignored that is important is why over time, the discounting cue becomes less accessible than the message even when both pieces are similarly effective at the onset.  To answer this question Greenwald, Pratkanis, and their team (Greenwald et al., 1986; Pratkanis et al., 1988) implemented a study to identify the conditions by which the sleeper effect does and does not occur.
Pratkanis directed a series of seventeen experiments in which he presented the discounting cue either before or after the message and found that the sleeper effect occurred mostly when the cue followed the message but not when the cue was first. 
In order to explain his findings, Pratkanis and his team proposed a modified forgetting hypothesis, which suggested that the sleeper effect occurs because the effect of the message and the cues decay at different rates. Based on this suggestion the message and the cue act like two communications operating in opposite directions. The sleeper effect emerges when the effect of these communications is about equal, promptly following message exposure, but the effect of the cue later decays more rapidly than that of the message. However, the timing of the discounting cue is essential to produce the effect because information presented first lasts longer, whereas more recent information dissipates more rapidly (Miller &amp; Campbell, 1959). Thus, the sleeper effect should occur when the discounting cue occurs at the end of a persuasive communication and stimulates a primacy effect of the message content.
Years later, Pratkanis, Greenwald, Leippe, and Baumgardner (1988) offered an [[Alternate hypothesis|alternative hypothesis]] that differed from Hovland and his colleagues.

They argued that the conditions under which the sleeper effect is more likely to occur were not emphasized by the dissociation hypothesis.  Additionally, the requirements for a sleeper effect specified by Gruder et al. (1978) did not detail the empirical conditions necessary to observe the sleeper effect.

The first social maps date from the early 20th century. A recent example is the mapping of the residences of U.S. [[Facebook]] users and their social links [http://petewarden.typepad.com/searchbrowser/2010/02/how-to-split-up-the-us.html].

In ''marketing'' a '''social map''' is a visualized analysis of a [[digital identity]] of a person, brand or company. A social map shows exactly where a digital identity is created, formed or discussed and sets each element in context and proportions.

These social map created an intense discussion about [[Online reputation|digital reputation]] and digital identities. For companies a so-called Corporate Social Map is still very new and an unusual methodology, but also very effective and meaningful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24745">{{sexual orientation}}
'''Sociosexual orientation''', or '''sociosexuality''', is the individual difference in the willingness to engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] outside of a committed relationship. Individuals with a more ''restricted'' sociosexual orientation are less willing to engage in casual sex; they prefer greater love, commitment and emotional closeness before having sex with romantic partners. Individuals who have a more ''unrestricted'' sociosexual orientation are more willing to have casual sex and are more comfortable engaging in sex without love, commitment or closeness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Gangestad | first2 = S.W. | year = 1991 | title = Individual differences in sociosexuality: Evidence for convergent and discriminant validity | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = 6| pages = 870–883 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.60.6.870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{Main|Sociosexual Orientation Inventory}}
The revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI-R) was designed to measure sociosexuality, with high SOI scores corresponding to an unrestricted orientation and low SOI scores denoting a more restricted orientation. The SOI-R also allows for the separate assessment of three facets of sociosexuality: behavior, attitude and desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Penke | first1 = L. | last2 = Asendorpf | first2 = J. B. | year = 2008 | title = Beyond global sociosexual orientations: A more differentiated look at sociosexuality and its effects on courtship and romantic relationships | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 5| pages = 1113–1135 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.5.1113 | pmid=18954197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender differences and sexual orientation==
Men tend to have higher SOI scores and be more unrestricted than women across a variety of cultures.&lt;ref name="FirstSchmitt"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmitt | first1 = D. P. | year = 2005 | title = Sociosexuality from Argentina to Zimbabwe: A 48-nation study of sex, culture, and strategies of human mating | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 247–311 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x05000051 | pmid=16201459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmitt"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmitt | first1 = D. P. | year = 2007 | title = Sexual strategies across sexual orientations: How personality traits and culture relate to sociosexuality among gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and heterosexuals | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality | volume = 18 | issue = 2–3| pages = 183–214 | doi=10.1300/j056v18n02_06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is more variability in scores within each gender than between men and women, indicating that although the average man is less restricted than the average woman, individuals may vary in sociosexual orientation regardless of gender.&lt;ref name="Gangestad"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gangestad | first1 = S. W. | last2 = Simpson | first2 = J. A. | year = 2000 | title = The evolution of human mating: Trade-offs and strategic pluralism | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 23 | issue = 4| pages = 573–587 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x0000337x | pmid=11301543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bisexuality|Bisexual]] women are significantly less restricted in their sociosexual attitudes than both [[lesbian]] and [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] women. Bisexual women are also the most unrestricted in sociosexual behavior, followed by lesbians and then, heterosexual women.&lt;ref name="Schmitt"/&gt; [[Homosexuality|Gay]] and bisexual men are similar to heterosexual men in sociosexual attitudes, in that they express relatively unrestricted attitudes relative to women. However, gay men are the most unrestricted in sociosexual behavior, followed by bisexual men and then, heterosexual men. This may be because gay men have more potential mating partners who prefer short-term, casual sexual encounters.&lt;ref name="Schmitt"/&gt;

Unrestricted sociosexuality is associated with early life experiences with sex, more frequent [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] and a greater number of lifetime sex partners.  Unrestricted men tend to have greater [[rape myth]] acceptance, past sexual aggression and more conservative attitudes about women than restricted men. Unrestricted women tend to have more sexual fantasies involving having power or control over another person and lower levels of sexual conservatism than restricted women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yost | first1 = M.

==Individual differences==
Individuals who are sociosexually unrestricted tend to score higher on [[openness to experience]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lameiras Fernández | first1 = M. | last2 = Rodríguez Castro | first2 = Y. | year = 2003 | title = The Big Five and sexual attitudes in Spanish students | url = | journal = Social Behavior and Personality | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 357–362 | doi=10.2224/sbp.2003.31.4.357}}&lt;/ref&gt; and be more [[Extraversion and introversion|extraverted]],&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = T.

High [[self-monitoring]] is also associated with unrestricted sociosexuality, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sakaguchi | first1 = K. | last2 = Sakai | first2 = Y. | last3 = Ueda | first3 = K. | last4 = Hasegawa | first4 = T. | year = 2007 | title = Robust association between sociosexuality and self-monitoring in heterosexual and non-heterosexual Japanese | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 43 | issue = 4| pages = 815–825 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with an intrinsic religious orientation (i.e., religion as an end) tend to be sociosexually restricted, while those with an [[extrinsic religious orientation]] (i.e., religion as a mean to achieve non-religious goals) tend to be unrestricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rowatt | first1 = W.C. | last2 = Schmitt | first2 = D.P. | year = 2003 | title = Associations between religious orientation and varieties of sexual experience | url = | journal = Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 455–465 | doi=10.1111/1468-5906.00194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mating tendencies==

===Motives===
Unrestricted women are more motivated to engage in casual sex than restricted women as they perceive more benefits associated with short-term mating. These include sexual benefits (e.g., experiencing the novelty of a new partner), resource benefits (e.g., receiving expensive gifts) and the improvement of their seduction skills. Sociosexuality is not associated with short-term benefits for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greiling | first1 = H. | last2 = Buss | first2 = D. M. | year = 2000 | title = Women's sexual strategies: The hidden dimension of extra-pair mating | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 929–963 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(99)00151-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When viewing attractive female models, unrestricted men are more interested in the models’ [[physical attractiveness]], while restricted men show more interest in the social traits presumably possessed by attractive females. Unrestricted women report more interest in attractive male models’ popularity and are less interested in their willingness to commit, compared to restricted women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Townsend | first1 = J. M. | last2 = Wasserman | first2 = T. | year = 1998 | title = Sexual attractiveness: Sex differences in assessment and criteria | url = | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 171–191 | doi=10.1016/s1090-5138(98)00008-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mate preferences===
Men and women with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation view short-term mates with greater sexual experience as more desirable, whereas restricted women perceive partners’ sexual inexperience as desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiederman | first1 = M. W. | last2 = Dubois | first2 = S. L. | year = 1998 | title = Evolution and sex differences in preferences for short-term mates: Results from a [[policy capturing]] study | url = | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 153–170 | doi=10.1016/s1090-5138(98)00006-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sprecher | first1 = S. | last2 = Regan | first2 = P.

A. | last2 = Gangestad | first2 = S. W. | year = 1992 | title = Sociosexuality and romantic partner choice | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 31–51 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1992.tb00264.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judgement of sexual attractiveness is more variable in unrestricted men than in restricted males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townsend|first=J. M.|last2=Wasserman|first2=T.|date=June 1997|title=The perception of sexual attractiveness: sex differences in variability|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=26|issue=3|pages=243–268|issn=0004-0002|pmid=9146813|doi=10.1023/a:1024570814293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals are able to accurately assess the sociosexual orientation of computer-generated and real faces, with unrestricted sociosexuality being associated with greater attractiveness in female faces and greater masculinity in male faces. Women tend to prefer male faces associated with restricted sociosexuality, while men prefer unrestricted female faces, both for short-term and long-term partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boothroyd | first1 = L. G. | last2 = Jones | first2 = B. C. | last3 = Burt | first3 = D. M. | last4 = DeBruine | first4 = L. M. | last5 = Perrett | first5 = D. I. | year = 2008 | title = Facial correlates of sociosexuality | url = | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 211–218 | doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.12.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boothroyd | first1 = L.G. | last2 = Cross | first2 = C.P. | last3 = Gray | first3 = A.W. | last4 = Coombes | first4 = C. | last5 = Gregson-Curtis | first5 = K. | year = 2011 | title = Perceiving the facial correlates of sociosexuality: further evidence | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 422–425 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.10.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship interactions===
Unrestricted women report engaging in more social interactions with men on a daily basis than restricted women. However, unrestricted individuals rate their interactions with their best friends (non-romantic) as lower in quality (i.e., as less pleasant and satisfying) than restricted individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hebl | first1 = M. R. | last2 = Kashy | first2 = D. A. | year = 1995 | title = Sociosexuality and everyday social interaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 371–383 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1995.tb00099.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unrestricted individuals are also more likely to view cheating or [[infidelity]] as acceptable under certain conditions (e.g., when involved in a bad relationship), and report engaging in more cheating than restricted individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feldman | first1 = S. S. | last2 = Cauffman | first2 = E. | year = 1999 | title = Your cheatin' heart: Attitudes, behaviors, and correlates of sexual betrayal in late adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 227–252 | doi=10.1207/s15327795jra0903_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between sociosexual orientation and infidelity is mediated by commitment, meaning unrestricted individuals may cheat because they are less committed to their partner than restricted individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mattingly | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Clark | first2 = E. M. | last3 = Weidler | first3 = D. J. | last4 = Bullock | first4 = M. | last5 = Hackathorn | first5 = J. | last6 = Blankmeyer | first6 = K. | year = 2011 | title = Sociosexual orientation, commitment, and infidelity: A mediation analysis | url = | journal = The Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 151 | issue = 3| pages = 222–226 | doi=10.1080/00224540903536162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hormones==
Individuals who are partnered typically have lower [[testosterone]] levels than individuals who are single. However, this was found to apply solely to individuals possessing a restricted sociosexual orientation. Partnered, unrestricted men and women’s testosterone levels are more similar to the levels of single men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edelsteinlab.psych.lsa.umich.edu/pubs/Edelstein%20et%20al%202011%20HB.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Edelstein|first1=R.S.|last2=Chopik|first2=W.J.|last3=Kean|first3=E.L.|year=2011|title=Sociosexuality moderates the association between testosterone and relationship status in men and women|work=Hormones and Behavior|volume=60 |pages=248–255|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2011.05.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
In regions that suffer from a high prevalence of [[infectious disease]]s, both men and women report lower levels of sociosexuality, as the costs of an incautious lifestyle (i.e., being unrestricted) may outweigh the benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schaller | first1 = M. | last2 = Murray | first2 = D. R. | year = 2008 | title = Pathogens, personality and culture: Disease prevalence predicts worldwide variability in sociosexuality, extraversion, and openness to experience | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 1| pages = 212–221 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.1.212 | pmid=18605861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
Possessing an unrestricted sociosexual orientation seems to increase the likelihood of having a son by 12-19% in American samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kanazawa | first1 = S. | last2 = Apari | first2 = P. | year = 2009 | title = Sociosexually unrestricted parents have more sons: A further application of the generalized Trivers-Willard hypothesis (gTWH) | url = | journal = Annals of Human Biology | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 320–330 | doi=10.1080/03014460902766918}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be explained by the generalized [[Trivers–Willard hypothesis|Trivers-Willard hypothesis]], which states that parents who possess any heritable trait that increases males’ reproductive success above females’  will have more sons, and will have more daughters if they possess traits that increase females’ reproductive success above males’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kanazawa | first1 = S | year = 2005 | title = Big and tall parents have more sons: Further generalizations of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 235 | issue = 4| pages = 583–590 | doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.02.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since unrestricted sociosexuality increases the reproductive fitness of sons more than daughters (as males have the potential to have more offspring through casual sex), unrestricted parents have a higher-than-expected offspring sex ratio (more sons).

==Relevant theories==

===Parental investment theory===
According to the parental investment theory, the gender that invests more in offspring tends to be more discriminating and more sociosexually restricted (usually women, due to pregnancy, childbirth and lactation).&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Eds.), ''Sexual selection and the descent of man'', 1871-1971. Chicago: Aldine.&lt;/ref&gt; In a year, a woman can give birth once (except in the case of a multiple pregnancy), regardless of the number of partners she has had, whereas a man can potentially have more children than the number of women with whom he has slept due to multiple births. Thus, women should be more selective and restricted in order to have children with partners possessing good genes and resources, who can provide for potential offspring. Men, however, may increase their reproductive fitness by being unrestricted and having many children with many women. Thus, since men do not need to invest as much physically (no pregnancy), they tend to have a more unrestricted sociosexual orientation.

===Sex ratio theory===
[[Operational sex ratio]] is the number of sexually competing males versus the number of sexually competing females in the local mating pool.&lt;ref name="FirstSchmitt"/&gt; High sex ratios indicate that there are more men than women available, while low sex ratios imply more women than men are sexually available. High sex ratios (more men) are associated with lower SOI scores (more restricted sociosexual orientation), as men must satisfy women’s preference for long-term [[Monogamy|monogamous]] relationships if they are to effectively compete for the limited number of women. Low sex ratios (more women) are correlated with more unrestricted sociosexuality, as men can afford to demand more casual sex if they are relatively scarce and in demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pedersen | first1 = F.

===Strategic pluralism theory===
{{Main|Strategic pluralism}}Strategic pluralism suggests that women evolved to evaluate men on two dimensions: their potential to be a good provider for offspring and their degree of genetic quality. The local environment should have influenced which mate characteristics were preferred by women. In demanding environments where biparental care was critical to infant survival, women should have valued good parenting qualities more, leading men to adopt a more restricted sociosexual orientation and invest more in their offspring to help ensure their children survive. In disease-prevalent environments, good genes that would help offspring resist [[pathogen]]s should have been prioritized by women, leading healthy men to be more sociosexually unrestricted in order to pass on their genes to many offspring.&lt;ref name="Gangestad" /&gt;

===Social structural theory===
According to social structural theory, the division of labor and social expectations lead to gender differences in sociosexuality. In cultures with more traditional gender roles (where women have less freedom than men), gender differences in sociosexual orientation are larger. In these societies, where women have less access to power and money than men, it is expected that women should be more sexually restricted and only have sexual relations with men in the context of a committed relationship, whereas men may be sexually unrestricted if they wish. In more egalitarian societies, where men and women have equal access to power and money, the gender difference in sociosexuality is less pronounced, as individuals may take on the social role of the other gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = W. | last2 = Eagly | first2 = A.

[[File:Solar Heat Gain V2.png|thumb|right|320px|Solar gain through windows includes energy transmitted directly through the glass and energy absorbed by the glass and frame and then re-radiated into the space.]]
[[File:Othniel Looker House front (crop to roof).jpg|thumb|right|320px|Solar gain is illustrated by the snow on the roof of this house: sunlight has melted all of the snow, except for the area that is shaded by the chimney to the right.]]

'''Solar gain''' (also known as '''solar heat gain''' or '''passive solar gain''') refers to the increase in thermal energy of a space, object or structure as it absorbs incident [[Solar energy|solar radiation]]. The amount of solar gain a space experiences is a function of the total incident solar [[irradiance]] and of the ability of any intervening material to [[Transmittance|transmit]] or resist the radiation.

Objects struck by sunlight absorb its visible and short-wave infrared components, increase in temperature, and then re-radiate that heat at longer [[infrared]] [[wavelengths]]. Though transparent building materials such as glass allow visible light to pass through almost unimpeded, once that light is converted to long-wave infrared radiation by materials indoors, it is unable to escape back through the window since glass is opaque to those longer wavelengths. The trapped heat thus causes solar gain via a phenomenon known as the [[greenhouse effect]]. In buildings, excessive solar gain can lead to overheating within a space, but it can also be used as a passive heating strategy when heat is desired.

== Window Solar Gain Properties ==
Solar gain is most frequently addressed in the design and selection of windows and doors. Because of this, the most common metrics for quantifying solar gain are used as a standard way of reporting the thermal properties of window assemblies. In the United States, The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers ([[ASHRAE]])&lt;ref name=ASHRAE&gt;{{cite book|last1=ASHRAE|title=ASHRAE Handbook: Fundamentals|date=2013|publisher=ASHRAE|location=Atlanta, GA|url=http://www.ashrae.org|chapter= Chapter 15. Fenestration}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The [[National Fenestration Rating Council]] (NRFC)&lt;ref name=NFRC200&gt;{{citation|title=ANSI/NFRC 200-2017: Procedure for Determining Fenestration Product Solar Heat Gain Coefficient and Visible Transmittance at Normal Incidence.|publisher = NFRC|date = 2017|url=http://www.nfrc.org|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintain standards for the calculation and measurement of these values.

=== Shading Coefficient ===
The '''shading coefficient (SC)''' is a measure of the radiative thermal performance of a [[glass]] unit (panel or window) in a [[building]]. It is defined as the ratio  of solar radiation at a given wavelength and angle of incidence passing through a glass unit to the radiation that would pass through a reference window of frameless {{convert|3|mm|in}} Clear Float Glass.&lt;ref name=NFRC200 /&gt; Since the quantities compared are functions of both wavelength and angle of incidence, the shading coefficient for a window assembly is typically reported for a single wavelength typical of solar radiation entering normal to the plane of glass. This quantity includes both energy that is transmitted directly through the glass as well as energy that is absorbed by the glass and frame and re-radiated into the space, and is given by the following equation:&lt;ref name=FloridaSolar&gt;{{citation|last = McCluney|first = Ross|title = Fenestration Solar Gain Analysis|publisher = Florida Solar Energy Center/University of Central Florida|date = 1996|access-date = 8 November 2017|url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.30.2472&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;F(\lambda,\theta)=T(\lambda,\theta)+N*A(\lambda,\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

Here, λ is the wavelength of radiation and θ is the angle of incidence. "T" is the transmissivity of the glass, "A" is its absorptivity, and "N" is the fraction of absorbed energy that is re-emitted into the space.  The overall shading coefficient is thus given by the ratio:

&lt;math&gt;S.C. = F(\lambda,\theta)_1 / F(\lambda,\theta)_o&lt;/math&gt;

The shading coefficient  depends on the [[radiation properties]] of the window assembly. These properties are the [[Transmittance|transmissivity]] "T" , [[Absorptance|absorptivity]] "A", [[emissivity]] (which is equal to the absorptivity for any given wavelength), and [[reflectivity]] all of which are dimensionless quantities that together sum to 1.&lt;ref name=FloridaSolar /&gt; Factors such as [[color]], tint, and reflective coatings affect these properties, which is what prompted the development of the shading coefficient as a correction factor to account for this.  ASHRAE’s table of solar heat gain factors&lt;ref name=ASHRAE /&gt; provides the expected solar heat gain for ⅛” clear float glass at different latitudes, orientations, and times, which can be multiplied by the shading coefficient to correct for differences in radiation properties.
The value of the shading coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. The lower the rating, the less solar heat is transmitted through the glass, and the greater its shading ability.

In addition to glass properties, shading devices integrated into the window assembly are also included in the SC calculation. Such devices can reduce the shading coefficient by blocking portions of the glazing with opaque or translucent material, thus reducing the overall transmissivity.&lt;ref name=HCL&gt;{{cite book|last = Lechner|first = Norbert|title = Heating, Cooling, Lighting: Sustainable Design Methods for Architects|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|edition = 3rd|date = 2009|pages = 250–252|isbn = 9780470048092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Window design methods have moved away from the Shading Coefficient and towards the [[#Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)|Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)]], which is defined as the fraction of incident solar radiation that actually enters a building through the entire window assembly as heat gain (not just the glass portion). The standard method for calculating the SHGC also uses a more realistic wavelength-by-wavelength method, rather than just providing a coefficient for a single wavelength like the shading coefficient does.&lt;ref name=FloridaSolar /&gt; Though the shading coefficient is still mentioned in manufacturer product literature and some industry computer software,&lt;ref name=WINDOW&gt;{{cite web|title=WINDOW Documentation|url=https://windows.lbl.gov/tools/window/documentation|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is no longer mentioned as an option in industry-specific texts&lt;ref name = ASHRAE /&gt; or model building codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=ICC|title=2009 International Energy Conservation Code|date=2009|url=https://codes.iccsafe.org/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from its inherent inaccuracies, another shortcoming of the SC is its counter-intuitive name, which suggests that high values equal high shading when in reality the opposite is true. Industry technical experts recognized the limitations of SC and pushed towards SHGC in the United States (and the analogous g-value in Europe) before the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=DeathOfSC&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCluney|first1=Ross|title=The Death of the Shading Coefficient?|journal=ASHRAE Journal|date=1991|issue=March|pages=36–45|url=https://www.academia.edu/5340854/The_Death_of_the_Shading_Coefficient_ASHRAE_Journal_March_1991|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A conversion from SC to SHGC is not necessarily straightforward, as they each take into account different heat transfer mechanisms and paths (window assembly vs. glass-only). To perform an approximate conversion from SC to SHGC, multiply the SC value by 0.87.&lt;ref name=NFRC200 /&gt;

=== G-Value ===
G-value (sometimes also called a Solar Factor or Total Solar Energy Transmittance) is the coefficient commonly used in Europe to measure the solar energy transmittance of windows. Despite having minor differences in modeling standards compared to the SHGC, the two values are effectively the same. A g-value of 1.0 represents full transmittance of all solar radiation while 0.0 represents a window with no solar energy transmittance. In practice though, most g-values will range between 0.2 and 0.7, with solar control glazing having a g-value of less than 0.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = British Fenestration Rating Council|publisher = BFRC|url = https://www.bfrc.org/|access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)===
SHGC is the successor to the shading coefficient used in the United States and it is the ratio of transmitted solar radiation to incident solar radiation of an entire window assembly. It ranges from 0 to 1 and  refers to the solar energy transmittance of a window or door as a whole, factoring in the glass, frame material, sash (if present), divided lite bars (if present) and screens (if present).&lt;ref name=NFRC200 /&gt; The transmittance of each component is calculated in a similar manner to the shading coefficient. However, in contrast to the shading coefficient, the total solar gain is calculated on a wavelength-by-wavelength basis where the directly
transmitted portion of the solar heat gain coefficient is given by:&lt;ref name=FloridaSolar /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T = \int\limits_{350 \ nm}^{3500 \ nm}  T(\lambda) E(\lambda) d\lambda &lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;T(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is the spectral transmittance at a given wavelength in nanometers and &lt;math&gt;E(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; is the incident solar spectral irradiance. When integrated over the wavelengths of solar short-wave radiation, it yields the total fraction of transmitted solar energy across all solar wavelengths. The product &lt;math&gt;N*A(\lambda,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is thus the portion of absorbed and re-emitted energy across all assembly components beyond just the glass. It is important to note that the standard SHGC is calculated only for an angle of incidence normal to the window. However this tends to provide a good estimate over a wide range of angles, up to 30 degrees from normal in most cases.&lt;ref name=NFRC200 /&gt;

SHGC can either be estimated through simulation models or measured by recording the total heat flow through a window with a calorimeter chamber. In both cases, NFRC standards outline the procedure for the test procedure and calculation of the SHGC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = ANSI/NFRC 201-2017: Procedure for Interim Standard Test Method for Measuring the  Solar Heat Gain Coefficient of Fenestration Systems Using Calorimetry Hot Box Methods|publisher = NFRC|page = 19|access-date = 6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For dynamic fenestration or operable shading, each possible state can be described by a different SHGC.

Though the SHGC is more realistic than the SC, both are only rough approximations when they include complex elements such as shading devices, which offer more precise control over when fenestration is shaded from solar gain than glass treatments.&lt;ref name=HCL /&gt;

== Solar Gain in Opaque Building Components ==
Apart from windows, walls and roofs also serve as pathways for solar gain. In these components heat transfer is entirely due to absorptance, conduction, and re-radiation since all transmittance is blocked in opaque materials. The primary metric in opaque components is the Solar Reflectance Index which accounts for both  solar reflectance (albedo) and emittance of a surface.&lt;ref name=ASTM1980&gt;{{cite article|title = Standard Practice for Calculating Solar Reflectance Index of Horizontal and Low-Sloped Opaque Surfaces|publisher = ASTM International|doi = 10.1520/E1980-11|location = West Conshohocken, PA|date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materials with high SRI will reflect and emit a majority of heat energy, keeping them cooler than other exterior finishes. This is quite significant in the design of roofs since dark roofing materials can often be as much as 50 C° hotter than the surrounding air temperature, leading to large thermal stresses as well as heat transfer to interior space.&lt;ref name=HCL /&gt;

== Solar Gain and Building Design ==
{{Main|Passive solar building design}}
Solar gain can have both positive or negative effects depending on the climate. In the context of passive solar building design, the aim of the designer is normally to maximize solar gain within the building in the winter (to reduce [[space heating]] demand), and to control it in summer (to minimize cooling requirements). [[Thermal mass]] may be used to even out the fluctuations during the day, and to some extent between days.

=== Control of Solar Gain ===
Uncontrolled solar gain is undesirable in hot climates due to its potential for overheating a space. To minimize this and reduce cooling loads, several technologies exist for solar gain reduction. SHGC is influenced by the color or tint of glass and its degree of [[reflectivity]]. Reflectivity can be modified through the application of reflective metal oxides to the surface of the glass. [[Low-emissivity]] coating is another more recently developed option that offers greater specificity in the wavelengths reflected and re-emitted. This allows glass to block mainly short-wave infrared radiation without greatly reducing [[visible transmittance]].&lt;ref name=NFRC200 /&gt;

In climate-responsive design for [[climate zone|cold and mixed climates]], windows are typically sized and positioned in order to provide solar heat gains during the heating season. To that end, glazing with a relatively high solar heat gain coefficient is often used so as not to block solar heat gains, especially in the sunny side of the house. SHGC also decreases with the number of glass panes used in a window. For example, in [[Triple glazing|triple glazed windows]], SHGC tends to be in the range of 0.33 - 0.47. For [[double glazing|double glazed windows]] SHGC is more often in the range of 0.42 - 0.55.

Different types of glass can be used to increase or to decrease solar heat gain through fenestration, but can also be more finely tuned by the proper orientation of windows and by the addition of shading devices such as [[Overhang (architecture)|overhangs]], [[louver]]s, fins, [[porch]]es, and other architectural shading elements.

=== Passive Solar Heating ===
Passive solar heating is a design strategy that attempts to maximize the amount of solar gain in a building when additional heating is desired. It differs from active solar heating which uses exterior water tanks with pumps to absorb solar energy because passive solar systems do not require energy for pumping and store heat directly in structures and finishes of occupied space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0038-092X(77)90071-8 |title=Simulation analysis of passive solar heated buildings—Preliminary results |journal=Solar Energy |volume=19 |issue=3 |year=1977 |last1=Balcomb |first1=J.D |last2=Hedstrom |first2=J.C |last3=McFarland |first3=R.D |bibcode=1977SoEn...19..277B|pages = 2–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In direct solar gain systems, the composition and coating of the building glazing can also be manipulated to increase the greenhouse effect by optimizing their radiation properties, while their size, position, and shading can be used to optimize solar gain. Solar gain can also be transferred to the building by indirect or isolated solar gain systems.

Passive solar designs typically employ large south facing windows with a high SHGC and overhangs that block sunlight in summer months and permit it to enter the window in the winter. When placed in the path of admitted sunlight, high thermal mass features such as concrete slabs or [[trombe wall]]s store large amounts of solar radiation during the day and release it slowly into the space throughout the night.&lt;ref&gt;Balcomb, J.Douglas, editor. Passive Solar Buildings. MIT Press, 1992.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When designed properly, this can modulate temperature fluctuations. Some of the current research into this subject area is addressing the tradeoff between opaque thermal mass for storage and transparent glazing for collection through the use of transparent phase change materials that both admit light and store energy without the need for excessive weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0038-092X(97)00086-8 |title=TIM–PCM external wall system for solar space heating and daylighting |journal=Solar Energy |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=369 |year=1997 |last1=Manz |first1=H |last2=Egolf |first2=P.W |last3=Suter |first3=P |last4=Goetzberger |first4=A |bibcode=1997SoEn...61..369M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2401">In [[scheduling (disambiguation)|scheduling]], '''tardiness''' is a measure of a delay in executing certain operations and '''earliness''' is a measure of finishing operations before due time. The operations may depend on each other and on the availability of equipment to perform them.

Typical examples include [[Scheduling (production processes)|job scheduling in manufacturing]] and data delivery scheduling in data processing networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2767221 Minimizing tardiness in data aggregation scheduling with due date consideration for single-hop wireless sensor networks], ''Wireless Networks'', Volume 21 Issue 4, May 2015 Pages 1259-1273&lt;/ref&gt;

In manufacturing environment, [[inventory management]] considers both tardiness and earliness undesirable. Tardiness involves backlog issues such as customer compensation for delays and loss of goodwill. Earliness incurs expenses for storage of the manufactured items.&lt;ref&gt;Derya Eren Akyol, G. Mirac Bayhan, [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00170-007-0993-0 Multi-machine earliness and tardiness scheduling problem: an interconnected neural network approach], The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology May 2008, Volume 37, Issue 5, pp 576-588.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical formulations==

In an environment with multiple jobs, let the deadline be &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; and the completion time be &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; of job &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Then for  job &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; lateness is &lt;math&gt;L_i=C_i-d_i&lt;/math&gt;, earliness is &lt;math&gt;E_i = \max\{0, d_i-C_i\}&lt;/math&gt;, tardiness is  &lt;math&gt;T_i = \max\{0, C_i-d_i\}&lt;/math&gt;. The common [[objective function]]s are &lt;math&gt;C_\max, L_\max, E_\max, T_\max, \sum C_i, \sum L_i, \sum E_i, \sum T_i&lt;/math&gt; or weighted version of these sums, &lt;math&gt;w_iC_\max, w_iL_\max, w_iE_\max, w_iT_\max, \sum w_iC_i, \sum w_iL_i, \sum w_iE_i, \sum w_iT_i&lt;/math&gt;, where every job comes with a weight &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;. The weight is a representation of job cost, priority, etc.

In a large number of cases the problems of optimizing these functions are [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de/knust/class/ "Complexity results for scheduling problems"], [[University of Osnabrueck]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Reef Ball Foundation''', Inc. is a [[501(c)(3)]] publicly supported non-profit organization that functions as an international environmental [[Non-governmental organization]]. The foundation uses '''Reef Ball''' [[artificial reef]] technology, combined with [[coral]] propagation, [[Transplanting|transplant]] technology, public education and community training to build, restore and protect [[coral reef]]s.  The foundation has established "Reef Ball [[reef]]s" in 59 countries, and ongoing projects increase the number to more than 70. Over 550,000 Reef Balls have been deployed in more than 4,000 projects.

==History==


&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Unsettled reefballs.jpg|frame|right|150px|A cluster of reef balls in [[Curaçao]].]] --&gt;

The Reef Ball Foundation was founded in 1993 by Todd Barber, who also founded the Reef Ball Development Group INC. with a goal of helping to preserve and protect coral reefs for the benefit of future generations.&lt;ref name="cnn2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/03/06/heroes.barber/index.html |title=Reef restoration provides passion for diver |date=2008-03-07 |work=CNN Heroes |publisher=Cable News Network |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barber witnessed his favorite coral reef on [[Grand Cayman]] destroyed by [[Hurricane Gilbert]], and wanted to do something to help increase the [[resilience (ecology)|resiliency]] of eroding coral reefs. Barber and his father [[patent]]ed&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|US|5564369A|Reef Ball patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of building reef substrate modules with a central inflatable bladder, so that the modules would be [[buoyancy|buoyant]], making them easy to deploy by hand or with a small boat, rather than requiring heavy machinery.

Over the next few years, with the help of research colleagues at [[University of Georgia]], Nationwide Artificial Reef Coordinators and the [[Florida Institute of Technology]], Barber, his colleagues and business partners worked to perfect the design. Reef balls can be found in almost every coastal state in the United States, and on every continent including Antarctica.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The Foundation has expanded the scope of its projects to include coral rescue, propagation and transplant operations, beach restorations, [[mangrove]] restorations and [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] development. Reef Ball also participates in education and outreach regarding environmental [[stewardship]] and coral reefs.

In 2001, The Reef Ball Foundation took control of the Reef Ball Development Group, and now operates all aspects of the business as a [[non-profit]] organization. By 2007, the foundation had deployed 550,000 reef balls worldwide.&lt;ref name="wsj2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119334933043772085 |title=From Balls of Concrete To Habitats for Sea Life |last=Naik |first=Gautam |date=2007-10-26 |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reef Ball Foundation manufactures reef balls for open ocean deployment in sizes from {{convert|30|cm|ft|sigfig=1}} in diameter and {{convert|15|kg|lb}}, up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} and {{convert|3500|kg|sigfig=1}}. Reef balls are hollow, and typically have several [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|convex-concave]] holes of varying sizes to most closely approximate natural coral reef conditions by creating [[whirlpool]]s.  Reef balls are made from [[pH]]-balanced [[Silica fume|microsilica]] [[concrete]], and are treated to create a rough surface texture, in order to promote settling by marine organisms such as [[coral]]s, [[algae]], [[coralline algae]] and [[sponge]]s.

Over the last decade, research has been conducted with respect to the ability of artificial reefs to produce or attract [[biomass]],&lt;!-- [http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/AR_BACI_ostenberg_stmary.pdf] dead link 404 on 2009-09-18 --&gt;&lt;ref name="pickering1997"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Helen |last1=Pickering |first2=David |last2=Whitmarsh |year=1997 |title=Artificial reefs and fisheries exploitation |journal=Fisheries Research |issue=31 |pages=39–59 |issn=0165-7836 |url=http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/AR_atr_vs_prod.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2009-09-18|doi=10.1016/s0165-7836(97)00019-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;the effectiveness of reef balls in replicating natural habitat,&lt;ref name="nyanti2005"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lee |last1=Nyanti |first2=Nazzatul Asyikin Mohd |last2=Najib |year=2005 |title=Distribution and Diversity of Fishes at Artificial Reef Balls Around Talang-Talang Islands, Sematan |journal=RIMC Research Update |publisher=Universiti Malaysia Sarawak |volume=2 |issue=1 |issn=1675-5820 |url=http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/sarawakresults.htm |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sherman2002"&gt;{{cite journal |first=RL |last=Sherman, |year=2002 |title=Artificial reef design: void space, complexity, and attractants |journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science |publisher=International Council for the Exploration of the Sea |volume=59 |pages=196–200 |issn=1054-3139 |url=http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/reefball_voids.pdf |format=pdf |doi=10.1006/jmsc.2001.1163 |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mitigating disasters.&lt;ref name="quinn2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/Hypothesis-based%20Restoration%20Study%20For%20Mitigation%20of%20a%20Damaged%20SE%20Florida%20Coral%20Reef%20A%20Work%20in%20Progress.htm |title=Hypothesis-based Restoration Study For Mitigation of a Damaged SE Florida Coral Reef |first1=TP |last1=Quinn |first2=EA |last2=Glynn |first3=RE |last3=Dodge |first4=K |last4=Banks |first5=L |last5=Fisher |first6=RE |last6=Spieler |date=2005-08-12 |publisher=National Coral Reef Institute |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of reef balls as [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]s and for beach stabilization has been extensively studied.&lt;ref name="miami2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/FSMiami.pdf |format=pdf |title=Miami Beach, Florida |date=September 2004 |work=National Erosion Control Development and Demonstration Program (Section 227) |publisher=U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harris2003"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Harris |first=Lee E |date=June 2003 |title=Artificial Reef Structures for Shoreline Stabilization and Habitat Enhancement |conference=Proceedings of the 3rd International Surfing Reef Symposium, Raglan, New Zealand |pages=176–8 |url=http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/Lee%20Harris_ASR_RBBW.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harris2005b"&gt;{{cite web |last=Harris |first=Lee E |url=http://www.artificialreefs.org/ScientificReports/CancunHotelRBstability.htm |title=Stability analysis performed for the proposed submerged artificial reef breakwater |date=2005-08-12 |accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:RB deploy.jpg|thumb|Reef balls about to be deployed as part of the [[Newmont Mining|PT Newmont]] mitigation project]] --&gt;

The Foundation undertakes an array of projects including artificial reef deployment, [[estuary]] restoration, mangrove plantings, [[oyster]] reef creation, coral propagation, [[natural disaster]] recovery, [[erosion]] control, and education.

Notable projects include:

* In [[Antigua]], undertaking 4,700 modules were deployed around the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reefinnovations.com/projects/western-atlantic/caribbean-reef-balls/antigua|title=Antigua|website=Reef Innovations|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Malaysia]], 5,000 reef balls were deployed around protected [[sea turtle]] nesting islands to deter netting, successfully increasing nesting numbers.
* In [[Campeche]], [[Mexico]], over 4,000 reef balls deployed by local [[fishing]] communities to enhance [[fisheries|fishery]] resources.
* In [[Tampa Bay]], USA, reef balls were installed beneath [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]s, in front of [[sea wall]]s, and as a submerged breakwater to create oyster reefs.
* In [[Phuket, Thailand]], reef balls were planted with corals after the [[Boxing Day Tsunami]] to help restore [[tourism]].
* In [[Indonesia]], locals and [[Newmont Mining|P.T. Newmont]] used reef balls to [[Environmental mitigation|mitigate]] damage from [[mining]] operations and restore thousands of coral heads.
* In Australia, reef balls have been used to enhance fisheries in New South Wales.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Designed artificial reefs===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2018}}

The trend in artificial reef development has been toward the construction of designed artificial reefs, built from materials specifically designed to function as reefs. Designed systems (such as reef balls) can be modified to achieve a variety of goals. These include coral reef [[wildlife rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], fishery enhancement, [[snorkeling]] and [[Scuba diving|diving]] trails, beach erosion protection, [[surfing]] enhancement, [[spawn (biology)|fish spawning]] sites, planters for [[mangrove]] replanting, enhancement of [[lobster]] [[fishery|fisheries]], creation of oyster reefs, estuary [[land rehabilitation|rehabilitation]], and even exotic uses such as deep water ''[[Oculina]]'' coral replanting.  Designed systems can overcome many of the problems associated with "materials of opportunity" such as stability in [[storms]], durability, biological fit, lack of potential [[pollution]] problems, availability, and reduction in long term artificial reef costs.

Designed reefs have been developed specifically for coral reef rehabilitation, and can therefore be used in a more specific [[Ecological niche|niche]] than materials of opportunity. Some examples of specialized adaptations which "designed reefs" can use include: specialized surface textures, coral planting attachment points, specialized pH-neutral surfaces (such as neutralized concrete, [[ceramic]]s or [[mineral|mineral accretion]] surfaces), fissures to create [[Ocean current|currents]] for corals, and avoidance of materials such as [[iron]] (which may cause [[algae]] to overgrow coral).{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  Other types of designed systems can create [[aquaculture]] opportunities for lobsters, create oyster beds, or be used for a large variety of other specialized needs.

'''''ToryBoy The Movie''''' is a 2011 [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]]-style British documentary feature film directed by and starring [[John Walsh (filmmaker)|John Walsh]]. It follows Walsh as he becomes a political candidate for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the north east England constituency of [[Middlesbrough]]. 

==Background==
A staunch [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] supporter all his life, Walsh had become disillusioned with the party. When [[David Cameron]] opened the door to allow non party members to run for the Conservative candidacy ahead of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/5377839/David-Cameron-to-open-up-candidate-list-to-everyone.html|title=David Cameron to 'open up candidate list to everyone'|author=Chris Irvine|date=24 May 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Walsh decided to do just that and document his experiences on camera.&lt;ref name="Young People"&gt;[https://youngpeopleinpolitics.org.uk/inspiration/interviews/ John Walsh interview, Young People In Politics, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; He came third in the election; Stuart Bell remained the MP of Middlesbrough,&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-13960870|title=Tory Boy takes on Sir Stuart Bell in documentary film|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but increased the Conservative vote to its highest in thirty years with an 18.8% share of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/c92.stm|title=BBC News - Election 2010 - Constituency - Middlesbrough|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The film==
The film was based on the 72 hours of footage made by Walsh on the campaign trail.&lt;ref name="Young People"/&gt; It made the case that [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s [[Stuart Bell]] should not be the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) of [[Middlesbrough]], as Bell was absent so often from Middlesbrough that he is an unsuitable candidate. Walsh showed the finished film in a free showing a year after the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/toryboy-movie-documentary-up-award-3691723|title=Toryboy The Movie documentary up for award|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=5 August 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the ''Who Can I vote For?'' website a humorous warning is given, "this film contains strong language throughout and scenes of politicians that some viewers may find offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/person/493/john-walsh|title=John Walsh for Member of Parliament for Middlesbrough in the 2010 General Election|website=Who Can I Vote For? by Democracy Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Amesbury]] appeared in the documentary protesting outside the Conservative conference in Manchester.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

Walsh paid homage to the great title designer [[Saul Bass]] and recreated his angular animations to create a fresh approach to telling this story. “This map cap comedy best captured the visual style and the transition of the film was making from a serious expose of the political shenanigans in the North East, to a political satire.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewhitebalance.com/work/toryboy-the-movie.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh said that he took a risk making this film in an article with Digital Journal "For something like this, an investigative film, there will be some who think that I have exceeded my brief as a candidate. I would say that it is right to look at injustice and in this country people have died so that we may all have the right to question those in authority and those in public office."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaljournal.com/blog/11509&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Northern Echo]]'' discussed the possible of the film forcing a new by election as a result of its findings. Walsh said he had been serious about becoming an MP and had self-funded his £15,000 election campaign. "When I got to Middlesbrough I found a town that politics had forgotten and a MP who was there in name only, a truly depressingly affair.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9028657.Documentary__could_force_by_election_/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The film received positive reviews, with a high score of 8.8 on [[IMDb]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740117/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2011 the film was nominated for the [[Grierson Awards]] for "Best Documentary on a Contemporary Theme".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.griersontrust.org/grierson-awards/past-awards/2011/the-grierson-awards-2011-shortlist/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://lfs.org.uk/content/john-walshs-tory-boy-movie-shortlisted-grierson-awards&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Radio Times]]'' film review by Jeremy Aspinall on the film's re-release gave it four stars, and called it "A revealing and droll fly-on-the-wall documentary. It's a fascinating odyssey illuminated by pithily informative animations. Who would have thought politics could be so entertaining?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/c5xq27/toryboy-the-movie|title=Toryboy the Movie|author=Jeremy Aspinall|work=RadioTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Details of the film's award nomination was covered by the Middlesbrough ''[[Teesside Gazette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/toryboy-movie-documentary-up-award-3691723&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Irish Post]]'' Walsh’s “documentary about a rookie Conservative candidate aimed to provide an insight into British political culture, and in doing so uncovered the next big political scandal.” &lt;ref&gt;http://irishpost.co.uk/documentary-that-exposed-labour-scandal-back-in-theatres-ahead-of-election/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard Moss]], the [[BBC]]'s North East &amp; Cumbria Political editor, "some silliness aside, it is a thought-provoking insight into the way our political system works or doesn't work on the ground... But I'm not sure he quite nails down a case against Stuart Bell.. And John Walsh doesn't help his case with some of the content in the film."&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; [[Liberal Democratic Party|Liberal Democrat]] commentator Mark Pack wrote on his blog that "John Walsh portrays life on the campaign trail as it really is. It is a hugely enjoyable documentary, which mixes humour, drama and education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markpack.org.uk/29694/toryboy-john-walsh-portrays-life-on-the-campaign-trail-as-it-really-is/|title=ToryBoy: John Walsh portrays life on the campaign trail as it really is|date=1 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A screening at the [[Frontline Club]] took place on 22 November 2011 followed by a Q&amp;A with John Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontlineclub.com/toryboy_visits_the_frontline_club/|title=ToryBoy visits the Frontline Club|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire Magazine]]'' gave it three stars and called it a "shit stirring exposé of local politics that will make you cross".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=510147455692929&amp;set=pb.191458757561802.-2207520000.1384175778.&amp;type=3&amp;theater screenshot at Facebook] 20 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2017}} Samuel Scott from review site DVD Compare gave it a B- and wrote "I found this documentary very intriguing and very honest. John is a very likable character, and I wouldn't hesitate in voting for someone with so much passion for a second."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dvdcompare.net/review.php?rid=3637 DVD Compare] 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Doc Geeks commented that the film was "a blunt exposé combined with a tinge of lightheartedness. Satirical animation cleverly frames Britain in its political context".&lt;ref&gt;[http://docgeeks.com/2011/11/14/review-toryboy-the-movie/ Doc Geeks] November 14th, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, novelist [[Christopher Fowler]] wrote that ''ToryBoy The Movie'' was "a snapshot of our country’s political apathy in microcosm. It’s heartbreaking to see people blindly supporting their own demise as if they’re playing some kind of long game they’ll probably never live to see the outcome of. Oh, and it’s also very funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christopherfowler.co.uk/blog/2011/12/02/review-toryboy/|title=Re:View – ‘Toryboy’ - Christopher Fowler|website=www.christopherfowler.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the DVD was released Ben Kamal interviewed Walsh for the Aberdeen student newspaper ''[[Gaudie]]'', and wrote "I was prepared for some careful sneering in the interview and subsequent write-up. This did not (and could not) transpire: firstly because of the film, which comes across as [[Frank Capra]] scripted by [[Evelyn Waugh]]; secondly because of Walsh himself. He is warm, patient and generous, to my own shock I liked him and if you watch the film you'll like him too."&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/gaudie/docs/feb_25] 25 February 2014, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; "Dave", a reviewer at the website 60 Minutes With, wrote "''ToryBoy the Movie'' is a fantastic documentary and one in which you will be cheering for John despite what political party you follow. His journey from his Labour roots through to a Tory campaign is superbly documented and will have you both laughing and feeling his frustration in equal measure."&lt;ref&gt;[http://60minuteswith.co.uk/reviews/review-toryboy-movie/ 60 Minutes With], 15 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Northern Echo]]'' article by Lucy Richardson she reveals that “at the pre-election hustings, where Sir Stuart does not make an appearance, he tells voters that he will have Sir Stuart jailed before Christmas if elected.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/9120025.Jolt_from_the_blue/&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after the film release, Lord [[Michael Ashcroft]] wrote on his blog: "I’d defy anyone with an interest in politics not to enjoy this film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2012/05/lord-ashcroft-two-years-on-a-controversial-film-gives-a-witty-thought-provoking-snapshot-into-the-ge.html|title=Lord Ashcroft: Two years on, a controversial film gives a witty, thought-provoking snapshot into the general election|work=Conservative Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that "despite the zany tone of the film, it also has a hard-hitting message which questions whether one MP in his safe seat, and perhaps other MPs in similar situations, do enough to justify their salary and expenses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lordashcroft.com/2012/05/two-years-on-a-controversial-film-gives-a-witty-thought-provoking-snapshot-into-the-general-election/|title=Two years on, a controversial film gives a witty, thought-provoking snapshot into the general election - Lord Ashcroft|date=6 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 the political Guido Fawkes website also known as Order Order, ran an article entitled “Inside The Greatest Election Scandal of All Time” says that Walsh “lifted the lid on the real-life world of political campaigning.”&lt;ref&gt;https://order-order.com/2017/04/28/inside-greatest-election-scandal-time/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vice (magazine)|Vice Mangazine]]’s Joe Zadeh’s article suggests a link between how Labour in Middlesbrough lost the votes of blue collar people and its shift to the right. He cited ToryBoy The Movie as an example of this shift.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev445j/how-labour-lost-the-working-class&lt;/ref&gt;

In a podcast interview with BritFlicks Walsh talks about ToryBoy and the difficulties in making the film and also his plans to develop lost [[Ray Harryhausen]] film projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://britflicks.com/blog.aspx?blogid=24084&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2018/01/01/interview-john-walsh-tory-boy-the-movie-ray-harryhausen-podcast/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Although not explicitly inspired by the film, Neil Macfarlane, in a report for local newspaper''[[Teesside Gazette]]'', asked "Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?" when he failed to answer over 100 telephone calls made to his constituency office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/teessiders-getting-enough-sir-stuart-3693031|title=Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=6 September 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gazette'' story was picked up by national newspapers. ''[[The Independent]]'' asked "is Sir Stuart Bell Britain's laziest MP?"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Brown [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/no-surgeries-for-14-years--is-sir-stuart-bell-britains-laziest-mp-2350953.html No surgeries for 14 years - is Sir Stuart Bell Britain's laziest MP?], ''Independent'', 7 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;Richard Moss [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14847291 Middlesbrough MP Sir Stuart Bell fights laziest MP tag], BBC, 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guardian'' fact-checked the "laziest MP" claim and found that the laziest MP was [[Roger Godsiff]] but the report did confirm that Sir Stuart Bell did not maintain the pivotal role for a MP, an office in their constituency. &lt;ref name="reality check"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/sep/08/reality-check-britain-s-laziest-mp|title=Reality check: Who are Britain's laziest parliamentarians?|author=Polly Curtis|work=the Guardian|date=8 September 2011}}: "Bell has been an MP for nearly 30 years and has had a distinguished career in parliament as a frontbench spokesman on trade and industry in opposition and the spokesman for the Church of England in the House of Commons and member of the House of Commons commission until last year. He's part of a breed of politicians – also including the Tory [[Edward Leigh]] and Labour's [[Gerald Kaufman]] – who have been extremely active parliamentarians but not always maintained an office in their constituency. One measure of their parliamentary work is the proportion of votes they turn up to."&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party said it would be totally unacceptable if constituents had been unable to contact their MP. [[Ed Miliband]] and the Labour Party expect the highest standards from Labour representatives. It is totally unacceptable if the public cannot reach their MP.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/labour-launches-probe-middlesbrough-mp-3693109|title=Labour launches probe into Middlesbrough MP|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=8 September 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sir Stuart Bell did have a right of reply, which appeared in the short film ''ToryBoy The AfterMath''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2014/05/john-walsh-toryboy-the-aftermath-or-the-town-that-politics-forgot.html|title=John Walsh: ToryBoy – the aftermath (or: the Town That Politics Forgot…)|work=Conservative Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's expose nearly forced a By Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9028657.Documentary__could_force_by_election_/|title=Documentary 'could force by-election'|work=The Northern Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's re-release in 2015 caused more controversy after a showing in Middlesbrough by [[Teesside University]] was cancelled to avoid breaching union rules on political neutrality in the run up to the general election. According to Walsh's interview with ''[[Teesside Gazette]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-408518499/director-upset-as-toryboy-film-screening-cancelled&lt;/ref&gt; the film was booked in by the Student Union, but at the last minute the screening was halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2015/04/john-walsh-toryboy-the-move-banned-in-middlesbrough.html|title=ToryBoy The Movie – banned in Middlesbrough|author=John Walsh|work=Conservative Home|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Brown [http://mmj.tees.ac.uk/~project22/index5d95.html?p=863 Student Union involved in row over planned screening of controversial Toryboy the Movie], ''[[The North Crowd]]'' 27 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it's a shame really," said Walsh.

=== Large-Scale Collaborations ===
In September 2014, the Institute partnered with The Cure Parkinson's Trust on its Linked Clinical Trials initiative, which investigates repurposed drugs for use as disease-modifying treatments for Parkinson's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vari.vai.org/press-release-9-23-2014/|title=Van Andel Research Institute joins The Cure Parkinson’s Trust to accelerate development of new Parkinson’s disease treatments - VARI|date=2014-09-23|work=VARI|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; LCT has supported trials in ambroxol, exenatide, simvastatin, liraglutide and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/2016/02/24/promising-respiratory-drug-focus-of-new-clinical-trial-for-parkinsons-disease/|title=New Parkinson's Clinical Trial Will Evaluate Drug Already Approved for Respiratory Conditions - Parkinson's News Today|date=2016-02-24|work=Parkinson's News Today|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A month later, in October, the Institute announced a partnership with [[Stand Up to Cancer|Stand Up To Cancer]] to form the VARI–SU2C Epigenetics Dream Team, a multi-institutional collaboration to translate potential epigenetic treatments for cancer into clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vari.vai.org/press-release-10-20-2014/|title=Stand Up To Cancer Epigenetics Dream Team continues with $7.5 million funding from Van Andel Research Institute - VARI|date=2014-10-20|work=VARI|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vari.vai.org/vari-research/vari-su2c-dream-team/|title=Linked Clinical Trials Initiative|work=VARI|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team is led by Jones and [[Stephen B. Baylin|Stephen Baylin, M.D.,]], co-head of the Cancer Biology Program at Johns Hopkins University's Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. It has launched six clinical trials in cancers including metastatic colorectal cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer and bladder cancer.

=== Research Leadership ===
In 1999, [[George Vande Woude]], Ph.D., joined VARI&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2013/04/van_andel_institutes_george_va.html|title=Van Andel Institute's George Vande Woude in prestigious first class honored for cancer research|work=MLive.com|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its founding research director. He previously served as Director of the Basic Research Program at the Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center as well as the Director for the Division of Basic Sciences at the [[National Cancer Institute]]. In the early 1980s, Vande Woude's laboratory discovered the human [[C-Met|MET]] [[oncogene]], which is now an important target in the development of anti-cancer drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bottaro|first=D.

Waldsee is America's oldest and largest immersion program for German language and culture. Over 1,550 young people participate yearly, coming together from all 50 of the United States and many foreign countries. In 2009 Waldsee was recognized as a U.S. National Center of Excellence for its cultural immersion program by the [[American Association of Teachers of German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aatg.org/programs/kinder-lernen-deutsch/189-kld-centers-of-excellence.html|title= New Center of Excellence in 2010|work=AATG KLD Centers of Excellence|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Waldsee was the brainchild of professors Gerald Haukebo and Erhard Friedrichsmeyer at [[Concordia College, Moorhead|Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, USA]]. In 1961, the first two-week session of "Camp Waldsee" was held for 72 villagers.&lt;ref name="clv history"/&gt; The tuition was $75 and Erhard Friedrichsmeyer served as the dean of the program. Over the next decade, Waldsee began to grow in both the number of villagers attending as well as the number of weeks that the camp ran each summer. Waldsee's first "adventure program," Alpenland, was held at the Rising Wolf Ranch in [[Montana]], where villagers learned German while enjoying [[hiking|hikes]] in the mountains and [[horseback riding]]. 

In 1970, the [[high school]] credit program was launched, providing a four-week intensive instruction for high-school students equivalent to a full year's instruction in a traditional classroom. In 1973, Waldsee launched its first [[study abroad]] program, offering [[backpacking (travel)|backpacking]] and [[biking]] trips to [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]]. 

In the early 1980s, the permanent Waldsee site began to be built on Turtle River Lake, near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. 

In 2010, Waldsee celebrated its 50th anniversary. Events in 2010 included a major "Waldseefest" on July 24, 2010 and six different alumni weekends.

===World connections===
Waldsee enjoys a continuing [[sister city]] relationship with the German town of [[Bad Waldsee]], located in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. 

[[Horst Köhler]], the former President of the Federal Republic of Germany, was the official patron (Schirmherr) of Waldsee, as was his predecessor, [[Roman Herzog]]. Many German Ambassadors and other dignitaries have visited Waldsee. World leaders have endorsed Concordia Language Villages, notably former [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], and former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], whose daughter Chelsea attended Waldsee for six summers.&lt;ref name="clv history"&gt;{{cite web

Waldsee offers one-, two- and four-week living and learning experiences in German language and culture for beginning through advanced 7- to 18-year-olds.

The German Language Village has been cited as a model of innovative education by a wide variety of educators and organizations, including the [[American Association of Teachers of German]] and the [[Goethe Institut]] Inter Nationes. It has also been featured in such media as [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], [[Basler Zeitung]], [[ZDF]] German Television, [[CBS]] American Television, ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[German Life Magazine]]'', ''Oskar's'' and ''[[Deutschland (magazine)|Deutschland]]'' magazines, and been the subject of award-winning journalistic essays and various doctoral dissertations. 

===Daily life===
[[Image:Waldsee, Bemidji Panorama.JPG|thumb|right|Waldsee ''Marktplatz.'' The ''Gasthof'' dining hall can be seen at left, and the ''Bahnhof'' is in the background.]]
Waldsee offers programs that serve youth (7–18 years old), families of all ages, and adults; one of the high school credit programs travels abroad. During the academic year, Waldsee also hosts school groups.

The Waldsee credit program offers traditional instruction as well as credit programs in environmental learning and German (''die Gruene Welle'') and in [[medieval history]] and [[theater]] (''der Maerchenwald''). In the German apprentice program, starting in 2010, participants work half-time in the village stores, in gardening and green roof maintenance, music, the arts and the kitchen and bakery, and also learn half-time in intensive German language groups. 

Waldsee's non-credit programs include programs that focus on producing [[FM radio]] broadcasts at a live [[radio station]], learning about [[Swiss culture]] in tandem with the nearby French village [[Lac du Bois (camp)|Lac du Bois]] and the Italian village [[Lago del Bosco]], learning about the [[Natural environment|environment]], performing [[improvisational theater]] based on medieval lore and legends, and exploring German grammar in depth. 

Villagers can choose different activities every day. Waldsee offers a wide range of European sports from [[soccer]] to [[fencing]]. There is also traditional American [[Summer camp|camp]] activities such as [[human swimming|swimming]] and [[canoeing]] at the beach. Waldsee also has a few giant [[chess]] sets and a giant Mühle ([[Nine Men's Morris]]) game.

===Locations ===
Waldsee is currently located at a culturally authentic site on Turtle River Lake north of [[Bemidji]], [[Minnesota]]. Since its founding in 1961, Waldsee has also leased numerous sites across Minnesota. It also offers a credit program that travels abroad.

====Permanent site====
[[Image:WaldseeBemidjiMarktplatzAtDusk.jpg|thumb|left|Waldsee ''Marktplatz'' near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. The culturally authentic ''Gasthof'' dining hall can be seen in the background.]]
The Waldsee permanent site, which opened in 1982, is located at {{Coord|47|33|33.78|N|94|44|19.36|W|type:landmark_region:US}} near [[Bemidji]], Minnesota on Turtle River Lake, along with six other [[Concordia Language Village]] sites. In all, Waldsee can house up to 240 people (typically, there are about 170 students and 40-50 counselors).

The site is styled after a typical German village and is centered around a ''Marktplatz'', which is the center of most activity at ''Waldsee''. The ''Bahnhof'' is a large building near the entrance of the village that houses class and administrative rooms. The ''Gasthof'' is another building that serves as a dining hall and houses most indoor activities. There is an artists' colony, named ''[[Worpswede]]'', which has about 6 small cabins and houses the arts and crafts activities. 

The first building on the campsite was "''Haus Katja''", which is a log cabin that was built by a group of villagers. The first professionally built building was the ''[[Schwarzwaldhaus]]'' or [[Black Forest house]], which can house 64 people in four units as well as several more in separate sleeping rooms on the first floor. A twin to the ''Schwarzwaldhaus'' is the ''Max Kade Haus'', which was built a few years after the SWH and is very similar in design. 

Two new medium-sized residences have been recently built. The ''Erich Markel Haus'' (Oberammergau and Unterammergau) has room for 24 people in two units. The ''Robert Bosch Haus'' houses the healthcare center (''Heilbronn'') and another residence (''Stuttgart''). The newest building at ''Waldsee'' is the ''BioHaus'', the first certified [[passive house]] in North America. The ''BioHaus'' is an integrated environmental learning center and residence for up to 30 people, including a small apartment upstairs. There is also ''Café Einbeck'', where villagers can sample candy, soft drinks, and other foods from Europe or listen to a jukebox playing German-language music. ''Waldsee'' also has a ''Laden'' at which villagers can make purchases using ''Euro''.

====Leased sites====
Waldsee has also operated at leased sites since its founding in 1961. Waldsee has been located in [[Alexandria, Minnesota]], [[Vergas, Minnesota]], Menagha, Minnesota, Hackensack, Minnesota, and [[Cass Lake, Minnesota]]. Waldsee departed from Vergas in the summer of 2006 to make room for [[Al-Wāḥa]], the [[Arabic]] language village, which was founded that year.

====Abroad====
Waldsee travels abroad to [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]] with smaller groups of high school students studying German in their summer for credit.


==BioHaus (Passive House)==
In 2006, Waldsee opened the ''BioHaus'', the first certified [[passive house]] in North America, on its permanent site near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. It is built to the German passive house standard for energy conservation and renewable energy use, and uses 85% less energy than a house built to the Minnesota Energy Code.&lt;ref name="greenline"/&gt;

The construction of the BioHaus was funded in part through a grant from the [[Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt]] (DBU), which is the world's largest foundation dedicated to environmental practice, education and construction. The Waldsee passive house marked the first time that DBU had awarded such a grant in North America.&lt;ref name="standards"&gt;{{cite news

In 2007, the BioHaus won the [[Minnesota Environmental Initiative Award]] in the category of Air Quality and Climate Protection. It was a 2007 Nominee for the [[World Clean Energy Award]] in the construction category.&lt;ref name="initiative"&gt;{{cite web

===Cultural importance===
The fixtures are German, and the house helps to introduce students to the "new Germany" as well as preparing them for responsible and ecological citizenship in the global community, the mission of Concordia Language Villages. The modern house itself pays homage to the [[Bauhaus]] school of 1920s architecture, and floor-to-ceiling windows recall the symbolic transparency built into [[West German]] government buildings post-[[World War II]].&lt;ref name="germanyinfo"&gt;{{cite web

===Design===
The house was built using eight critical design strategies: Passive Solar Design, Superinsulation, Advanced Window Technology, Airtightness, Ventilation, Space Heating, Efficient Lighting and Electrical appliances.&lt;ref name="greenline"/&gt;

The building replaces 100% outside air; no air is recirculated through the system. Two underground tubes exchange outside and inside air eight feet beneath the ground, passively warming or cooling the air to match the temperature of the ground (~55°F year round). The house transfers heat between the outgoing air and the incoming air before it reaches the rooms, resulting in a difference of less than 10°F between the incoming fresh air and the desired room temperature, even in the midst of Minnesotan winter.&lt;ref name="greenline"/&gt;

Water in the house is heated by [[solar hot water|solar thermal heat panels]] on the roof, rather than [[photovoltaic]] solar cells, which would convert solar energy directly to electricity.&lt;ref name="germanyinfo"/&gt;

Low-growing plants make up the building's green roof, reducing rainwater runoff and adding another layer of insulation to the building.&lt;ref name="germanyinfo"/&gt; Additionally, the western half of the lower level of the structure is tucked into the slope, enabling natural insulation based on the soil.&lt;ref name="initiative"/&gt;
