'''Adam Kotsko''' (born July 19, 1980) is an American writer, theologian, religious scholar, and translator, working chiefly in the field of [[political theology]]. He served as an Assistant Professor of Humanities at [[Shimer College]] in Chicago, which was absorbed into [[North Central College]] in 2017. He is especially known for his interpretative work on [[Slavoj Žižek]] and [[Giorgio Agamben]], as well as his writing on American popular culture.

Kotsko's better-known works include ''Why We Love Sociopaths'' (2012), ''Awkwardness'' (2010), and ''Žižek and Theology'' (2008). He has published three translations of works by the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben. Kotsko is also known for his blogging, now in its second decade.  He posts chiefly on a group blog titled ''An und für sich'', but continues to maintain his original blog, titled ''The Weblog''.&lt;ref name="giant"/&gt;  Prior to the rise of blogging, he had maintained a blog-like website titled ''The Homepage''.&lt;ref name="giant"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Adam Kotsko was born in [[Flint, Michigan]], and grew up in nearby [[Davison, Michigan|Davison]].&lt;ref name="normblog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="red"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itself.wordpress.com/2010/03/19/red-toryism-the-british-invasion/|title=Red Toryism: The British Invasion|date=2010-03-19|accessdate=2013-05-24|author=Adam Kotsko|work=An und für sich}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has credited his school experiences in Davison with giving him a love of literature.&lt;ref name="normblog"/&gt;

Kotsko earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree at [[Olivet Nazarene University]] in [[Bourbonnais, Illinois]], in 2002.&lt;ref name="normblog"/&gt;&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt; From there, he went on to the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] (CTS), where he completed a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[religious studies]] in 2005, with a thesis in the form of a translation and commentary on [[Jacques Derrida]]'s essay "Literature in Secret: An Impossible Filiation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/literature-in-secret-an-impossible-filiation-by-jacques-derrida-translation-and-commentary/oclc/76942979&amp;referer=brief_results|title=An Impossible Filiation by Jacques Derrida: Translation and Commentary|work=Worldcat|accessdate=2013-05-24}}. [http://itself.files.wordpress.com/2007/01/derrida-literature-in-secret.pdf Text of translation].&lt;/ref&gt;

Kotsko completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in theology, ethics, and culture at CTS in 2009.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Adam Kotsko |url=http://www.shimer.edu/aboutshimercollege/AdamKotsko.cfm |publisher=Shimer College |accessdate=2013-05-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708055425/http://www.shimer.edu/aboutshimercollege/AdamKotsko.cfm |archivedate=2012-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His doctoral dissertation was titled ''Atonement and Ontology''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kotsko |first=Adam |year=2009 |title=Atonement and Ontology |degree=PhD |location=Chicago |publisher=Chicago Theological Seminary |oclc=456250141}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued that an understanding of [[atonement in Christianity|atonement theory]] requires a social-relational [[ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itself.wordpress.com/2009/02/11/my-dissertation-atonement-and-ontology/|title=My Dissertation: "Atonement and Ontology"|accessdate=2013-05-24|date=2009-02-11|author=Adam Kotsko|work=An und für sich}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A modified version of his dissertation was published by [[Continuum International Publishing Group]] in 2010 under the title of ''The Politics of Redemption: The Social Logic of Salvation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Redemption: The Social Logic of Salvation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YBSSBoNdUXYC&amp;pg=PR7|page=vii|author=Adam Kotsko|year=2010|isbn=0567185664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual and teaching career==
{{Quote box|width=250px|align=right|Shimer’s approach admittedly may seem unrealistic. I believe, however, that it’s not a matter of “cost” in an abstract sense, but rather a matter of priorities. At Shimer, the priority is classroom instruction, and everything else takes a back seat to that.
&lt;br/&gt;—Adam Kotsko, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2012/05/03/essay-value-intense-discussion-based-instruction|title=The Immersion Method -- I|author=Adam Kotsko|work=Inside Higher Ed|date=2012-05-03|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Soon after completing his doctorate in 2009, Kotsko began teaching at [[Kalamazoo College]], a liberal arts college in Michigan.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;  Initially a one-year appointment, it was subsequently extended to two.&lt;ref name="announce"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itself.wordpress.com/2011/04/25/an-announcement/|date=2011-04-25|accessdate=2013-05-24|author=Adam Kotsko|title=An announcement|work=An und für sich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kotsko graduation 2012 uncropped.jpg|thumb|Kotsko at the [[Shimer College]] commencement ceremony in Chicago in May 2012]]
In 2011, Kotsko was hired by [[Shimer College]], a very small [[great books|great-books]] college in Chicago.  He was one of three new Shimer professors hired that year, the school's largest intake of new faculty in more than a decade.&lt;ref name="hires"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shimer.edu/newsandevents/upload/2011-June-New-Faculty.pdf |title=Shimer Hires Three New Faculty Members |publisher=Shimer College |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2013-05-24 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his first year, he participated in a major reworking of the school's upper-level core Humanities courses.  He also served on numerous committees in Shimer's unusual self-governance body, the Shimer College Assembly; in April 2013 he was additionally elected [[parliamentarian (consultant)|parliamentarian]] of the assembly.&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itself.wordpress.com/cvs/kotsko-cv/|title=CVs: Adam Kotsko|author=Adam Kotsko|work=An und für sich|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, after years of declining enrollment and financial difficulties, Shimer was acquired by North Central College in Naperville, Illinois, with plans to integrate it as the "Shimer Great Books School" within the college's academic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northcentralcollege.edu/news/2017/06/02/north-central-college-successfully-acquires-shimer-great-books-program|date=2017-06-02|accessdate=2017-09-04|title=North Central College successfully acquires Shimer Great Books program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kotsko is known for his writings on the interpretation of the philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]], whom he has credited for causing him to "break out of one particular intellectual ghetto and into another" by changing his self-identification from "non-Republican" to leftist.&lt;ref name="normblog"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://normblog.typepad.com/normblog/2004/08/the_normblog_pr.html|date=2004-08-06|title=The normblog profile 46: Adam Kotsko|work=Normblog|author=Norman Geras|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first published book was on Žižek, titled ''Žižek and Theology'' (the first volume of T&amp;T Clark's "Philosophy and Theology" series).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tandtclark.typepad.com/ttc/2008/05/new-release-ziz.html|date=2008-05-09|accessdate=2013-05-24|publisher=T&amp;T Clark|title=New Release: Zizek and Theology}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a somewhat unusual circumstance for academic writers, it was published in 2008, before he had completed his dissertation.&lt;ref name="giant"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://htmlgiant.com/author-spotlight/another-long-interview-this-time-with-zizek-brain-adam-kotsko/|work=HTML Giant|title=Another long interview (this time with Žižek brain Adam Kotsko)|author=Adam Robinson|date=2009-06-15|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Kotsko published a more popular article on "How to Read Žižek" in the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Los Angeles Review of Books |url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=897 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905010858/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=897 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-05 |title=How to Read Žižek |author=Adam Kotsko |date=2012-09-02 |accessdate=2013-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was republished in Italian by ''[[Internazionale (magazine)|Internazionale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Internazionale: Sommario 985|url=http://www.internazionale.it/sommario/985/|date=February 2013|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kotsko has also published three book-length translations of works by Italian theologian [[Giorgio Agamben]].  He has also published and delivered a number of papers on Agamben.  He has argued that Agamben's ''Highest Poverty'', his translation of which was published in 2013, is "ultimately about confronting neoliberalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itself.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/highest-poverty-paper-may-2013-v2.pdf|date=2013-05-21|accessdate=2013-05-24|author=Adam Kotsko|title=What St. Paul and the Franciscans Can Tell Us About Neoliberalism: On Agamben's The Highest Poverty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=250px|align=left|At its best, awkward humour is more than entertainment – it is a lesson in solidarity.&lt;br/&gt;—Adam Kotsko, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/dec/31/bond-mad-men-peep-show|date=2010-12-31|author=Adam Kotsko|accessdate=2013-05-24|title=The bond of the awkward}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kotsko has published three short books on popular culture, ''Awkwardness: An Essay'' (2010), ''Why We Love Sociopaths: A Guide to Late Capitalist Television'' (2012), and ''Creepiness'' (2015). Each book draws out a specific theme found in contemporary U.S. TV shows; ''Awkwardness'' addressing the curious rise of "awkward humor" in the 21st century, ''Why We Love Sociopaths'' addressing the trend toward a certain type of deeply antisocial protagonist, and ''Creepiness'' uses a Freudian lens to distinguish a discomfiting strain of popular culture from the topic of the first book. The trilogy was greeted with general acclaim, with the ''[[Oxonian Review]]'' declaring that "''Awkwardness'' is just what a work of philosophy should be",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=Oxonian Review|title=Awkwardness|author=Tom Cutterham|url=http://www.oxonianreview.org/wp/awkwardness/|accessdate=2013-05-24|date=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Scott Berkun]] describing ''Why We Love Sociopaths'' as "a second cousin to Postman’s classic ''Amusing Ourselves to Death''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scottberkun.com/2013/why-we-love-sociopaths-book-review/|author=Scott Berkun|title=Why We Love Sociopaths: Book Review|date=2013-03-16|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Why We Love Sociopaths'', however, also drew criticism for its admittedly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why We Love Sociopaths: A Guide to Late Capitalist Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kzssKbEQOIgC&amp;pg=PA2|author=Adam Kotsko|page=2|isbn=178099091X|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; non-technical use of the term [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|sociopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|work=The Last Psychiatrist|url=http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2012/04/why_we_love_sociopaths.html|title=Why We Love Sociopaths|accessdate=2013-05-25|date=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''Awkwardness'' has led to Kotsko being cited as an authority on awkwardness in the press, including by ''[[US News and World Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=US News and World Report|title=How to Deal with an Awkward Co-Worker|author=Aaron Guerrero|url=http://money.usnews.com/money/careers/articles/2013/05/01/how-to-deal-with-an-awkward-co-worker|date=2013-05-01|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Kotsko caused a firestorm of controversy when he tweeted that all white people, regardless of their ancestry or whether their ancestors owned slaves, are "complicit" in slavery.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/2/adam-kotsko-white-shimer-college-professor-all-whi/|title=Adam Kotsko, white Shimer College professor: All whites ‘complicit’ in slavery|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the tweets were later deleted, Kotsko has said he stands by his statements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to this controversy, Kotsko has been named in an online "watch list" of college professors who discriminate against conservative students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.professorwatchlist.org/index.php/watch-list-directory/search-by-name/114-adam-kotsko|title=Adam Kotsko|last=Hern|first=Thomas|website=www.professorwatchlist.org|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Kotsko published a book about the figure of the [[Devil in Christianity]], ''The Prince of This World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=23793|title=The Prince of This World - Adam Kotsko|first=Stanford University|last=Press|website=www.sup.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously presented a paper before the [[American Academy of Religion]] on the influence of Agamben's writing on his thinking about the devil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://itself.wordpress.com/2012/11/18/the-prince-of-this-world-thinking-the-devil-in-light-of-agambens-kingdom-and-the-glory/|title=The Prince of This World: Thinking the Devil in Light of Agamben’s Kingdom and the Glory|date=2012-11-18|author=Adam Kotsko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amherst has historically had close relationships and rivalries with [[Williams College]] and [[Wesleyan University]] which form the [[Little Three]] colleges. The college is a member of the [[Five College Consortium]], which allows its students to attend classes at four other [[Pioneer Valley]] institutions: [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Smith College]], [[Hampshire College]], and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].

=== Founding and 19th century ===

Founded in 1821, Amherst College developed out of the secondary school Amherst Academy. The college was originally suggested as an alternative to [[Williams College]], which was struggling to stay open. Although Williams remained open, Amherst was formed and diverged from its Williams roots into an individual institution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/amherst-story/facts/history|title=History of Amherst {{!}} Amherst College|website=www.amherst.edu|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812, funds were raised in Amherst for a secondary school, Amherst Academy; it opened December 1814.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/historyofamhers00tyle#page/34/mode/2up History of Amherst College during its first half century 1821-1871]. Archive.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The academy incorporated in 1816.&lt;ref name=Adams1853&gt;{{cite book|title= Massachusetts Register |year=1853 |author=George Adams |location=Boston |publisher=Printed by Damrell and Moore |chapter=Education in Massachusetts: Incorporated Academies |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=MScDAAAAYAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The institution was named after the town, which in turn had been named after [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery, Lord Amherst]], a veteran from the [[Seven Years' War]] and later commanding general of the British forces in North America. On November 18, 1817, a project was adopted at the Academy to raise funds for the free instruction of "indigent young men of promising talents and hopeful piety, who shall manifest a desire to obtain a liberal education with a sole view to the Christian ministry."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www3.amherst.edu/~rjyanco94/amherst/history/1894tyler-ws/chapter01/menu.html|title=A History of Amherst College (1894) -- Chapter 1|website=www3.amherst.edu|access-date=2016-04-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220193925/http://www3.amherst.edu/~rjyanco94/amherst/history/1894tyler-ws/chapter01/menu.html|archive-date=December 20, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This required a substantial investment from benefactors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the fundraising for the project, it became clear that without larger designs, it would be impossible to raise sufficient funds. This led the committee overseeing the project to conclude that a new institution should be created. On August 18, 1818, the Amherst Academy board of trustees accepted this conclusion and began building a new college.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Establishment===
Moore, then [[List of Williams College presidents|President of Williams College]], however, still believed that [[Williamstown, Massachusetts|Williamstown]] was an unsuitable location for a college, and with the advent of Amherst College was elected its first president on May 8, 1821. At its opening, Amherst had forty-seven students. Fifteen of these had followed Moore from Williams College. Those fifteen represented about one-third of the whole number at Amherst, and about one-fifth of the whole number in the three classes to which they belonged in Williams College. President Moore died on June 29, 1823, and was replaced with a Williams College trustee, [[Heman Humphrey]]. Williams alumni are fond of an apocryphal story ascribing the removal of books from the Williams College library to Amherst College.&lt;ref&gt;[https://specialcollections.williams.edu/williams-history/groups/theft-of-the-williams-library/ Griffin D, The Theft of the Williams Library]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Williams president [[Harry C. Payne]] declared the story false, but many still nurture the legend.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Amherst grew quickly, and for two years in the mid-1830s it was the second largest college in the United States, second only to [[Yale College|Yale]]. In 1835, Amherst attempted to create a course of study parallel to the classical liberal arts education. This parallel course focused less on [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], instead focusing on [[English studies|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[chemistry]], [[economics]], etc. The parallel course did not take hold, however, until the next century.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Amherst was founded as a non-sectarian institution "for the classical education of indigent young men of piety and talents for the Christian ministry," (Tyler, ''A History of Amherst College''). One of the hallmarks of the new college was its Charity Fund, an early form of financial aid that paid the tuition of poorer students.&lt;ref name="NEcollege"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claude Moore Feuss|title=Amherst: Story of a New England College}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although officially non-denominational, the initial Amherst was considered a religiously conservative institution with a strong connection to [[Calvinism]], and as a result, there was considerable debate in the Massachusetts government over whether the new college should receive an official charter from the state, and a charter was not granted until February 21, 1825.&lt;ref name="NEcollege" /&gt; As a result of the official charter being granted four years after the official founding of the college, the Amherst seal lists a date of 1825. Religious conservatism persisted at Amherst until the mid-nineteenth century: students who consumed alcohol or played cards were subject to expulsion, and there were a number of [[Christian revival#United States 1800–1850|religious revival]]s at Amherst where mobs of righteous students would herd less religious students into the chapel and berate them for lack of piety.&lt;ref name="NEcollege" /&gt; Towards the end of the nineteenth century, however, the college began a transition towards secularism, culminating in the demolishing of the college church in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley King|title="The Consecrated Eminence": The Story of the Campus and Buildings of Amherst College |location=Amherst, Mass. |publisher=Amherst College |year=1951 |origyear=1952 |oclc=2747723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development and academic reform ===

Academic hoods in the United States are traditionally lined with the official colors of the school, in theory so watchers can tell where the hood wearer earned his or her degree. Amherst's hoods are purple (Williams' official color) with a white stripe or chevron, said to signify that Amherst was born of Williams. Amherst records one of the first uses of [[Latin honors]] of any American college, dating back to 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/0450/ChairsUpdateWebReady5-29-07.pdf |title=Annual Fund Update |date=May 29, 2007 |accessdate=August 15, 2013 |website=Amherst College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413124931/https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/0450/ChairsUpdateWebReady5-29-07.pdf |archivedate=April 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The college was an all-male school until the late 1960s, when a few female students from nearby schools in the Five-College Consortium attended on an experimental basis. In October 1974, the faculty voted in favor of coeducation and in November 1974 the board of trustees voted to admit female students starting in the 1975-1976 school year. In 1975, nine women who were already attending classes as part of an inter-college exchange program were admitted as transfer students. In June 1976, they became the first female graduates of the college.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amherst.edu/library/archives/exhibitions/coed25 Coeducation: 25 years | Amherst College]. Amherst.edu. Retrieved on 2014-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The college established the Black Studies Department in 1969. In 1973, it launched the nation's first undergraduate neuroscience program. In 1983, it established a Department of Asian Languages and Literatures, which was later to become the Department of Asian Languages and Civilizations.&lt;ref name="amherst.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.amherst.edu/aboutamherst/facts/history/timeline|title = An Amherst Timeline|website = Amherst College|accessdate = 2015-08-28|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150813192329/https://www.amherst.edu/aboutamherst/facts/history/timeline|archive-date = August 13, 2015|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1984, on-campus fraternities were abolished. The former fraternity buildings, which were owned by the college, were converted into residence halls.&lt;ref name="amherst.edu"/&gt; The Department of Women's and Gender Studies, which later became the Department of Sexuality, Women's, and Gender Studies, was established in 1987 and the Department of Law, Jurisprudence, and Social Thought in 1993.&lt;ref name="amherst.edu"/&gt;

In March 2013 the faculty adopted an [[open-access policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://roarmap.eprints.org/445/ |title= Amherst College |work=[[ROARMAP]]: Registry of Open Access Repository Mandates and Policies |publisher=[[University of Southampton]] |location=UK |accessdate= July 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amherst's comprehensive tuition, room, and board fee for the 2012–13 academic year is $55,510.

In July 2007, Amherst announced that grants would replace loans in all financial aid packages beginning in the 2008-09 academic year. Amherst had already been the first school to eliminate loans for low-income students, and with this announcement it joined [[Princeton University]], [[Cornell University]] and [[Davidson College]], then the only colleges to completely eliminate loans from need-based financial aid packages. Increased rates of admission of highly qualified lower income students has resulted in greater equality of opportunity at Amherst than is usual at elite American colleges.&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leonhardt |first=David |title=Top Colleges, Largely for the Elite |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/business/economy/25leonhardt.html |accessdate=May 25, 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 24, 2011 |quote=The result of these changes is that Amherst has a much higher share of low-income students than almost any other elite college. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527020916/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/business/economy/25leonhardt.html |archivedate=May 27, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic freedom debate ===
The writings of Amherst College political science Professor [[Hadley Arkes]] about homosexuality led to a dispute in 2013 over whether a college seeking to create a diverse, respectful academic community should speak out when a faculty member disparages community members or should instead remain silent as a way to protect academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldmag.com/2015/04/hadley_arkes_the_right_stuff|title=WORLD {{!}} Hadley Arkes: The right stuff {{!}} Marvin Olasky {{!}} April 18, 2015|website=WORLD|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue arose when a group of alumni petitioned the college trustees and President [[Carolyn Martin|Biddy Martin]] to "dissociate the institution" from Arkes's "divisive and destructive" views,&lt;ref name="terrasirradient.org"&gt;[http://terrasirradient.org/2013/10/18/petition-to-cullen-murphy-chair-of-amherst-college-board-of-trustees/ Petition to the Amherst College board of trustees | Amherst Against Homophobia].

Martin disagreed, citing past debates over the college's position on the Vietnam War and apartheid in South Africa—issues on which the college initially remained silent but eventually took a public position. In such times, she said, colleges should "avoid taking institutional positions on controversial political matters, except in extraordinary circumstances" and should simultaneously both "protect their communities from discrimination and disrespect" and "cherish a diversity of viewpoints."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amherst.edu/aboutamherst/president/reflections President's Reflections | Amherst College].

===Five College Consortium===
Amherst is a member of the [[Five College Consortium|Five Colleges]] consortium, which allows its students to attend classes at four other [[Pioneer Valley]] institutions. These include [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Smith College]], [[Hampshire College]], and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. In addition to the 850 courses available on campus, Amherst students have an additional 5,300 classes to consider through the Consortium (without paying additional tuition) and access to 8 million library volumes. The Five Colleges are geographically close to one another and are linked by [[Pioneer Valley Transit Authority|buses that run between the campuses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fivecolleges.edu/libraries|title=Libraries |access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Five Colleges share resources and develop common academic programs. [[Museums10]] is a consortium of local art, history and science museums. The Five College Dance Department is one of the largest in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fivecolleges.edu/dance/|title=Five College Dance Department - www.fivecolleges.edu|website=www.fivecolleges.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The joint Astronomy department shares use of the [[Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory]], which contributed to work that won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.umass.edu/~fcrao/telescope/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617043407/http://www.astro.umass.edu/~fcrao/telescope/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 17, 2006|title=The Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amherst's growing athletics program has been the subject of controversy in recent years due to dramatic contrasts between the racial and socioeconomic makeup of its student athletes and the rest of its student body, the clustering of athletes in particular academic departments, and a perceived "divide" on campus between varsity athletes and other students. Athletic skill plays a factor in the admissions decisions of between 28% and 35% of each incoming class.&lt;ref name="ath"&gt;"[http://amherststudent.amherst.edu/?q=article/2017/02/08/college-releases-report-state-athletics-program]", The Amherst Student.&lt;/ref&gt;  Part of this divide is caused by the fact that many social events are organized by teams, with the first hour or so of the party open only to team members before allowing in invited guests, basically reproducing the social segmentation the college hoped to avoid with the elimination of fraternities in the 1980s.{{fact|date=October 2018}}  

Amherst fields several club athletic teams, including [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], [[soccer]], [[Rowing (sport)|crew]], [[rugby union]], [[water polo]], [[Equestrianism|equestrian]], [[mountain biking]], [[fencing]], [[sailing]] and [[skiing]]. [[Intramural sports]] include soccer, tennis, golf, basketball, volleyball and softball.

The sport of Ultimate was started and named at Amherst College in the mid-1960s by Jared Kass.&lt;ref name=herndon&gt;{{cite web|title=This is How it All Began: An Interview with Jared Kass |date=August 30, 2003 |first=Willie |last=Herndon |origyear=Winter 2003 |url=http://www.ultimatehalloffame.org/sportstories/august.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107075156/http://www.ultimatehalloffame.org/sportstories/august.htm |archivedate=January 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |work=ultimatehalloffame.org |format=reprinted with permission |publisher=Originally published in the [[USA Ultimate|Ultimate Players Association]] newsletter |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/origins-and-development-ultimate-frisbee |title=The Origins and Development of Ultimate Frisbee |author=Gerald Griggs |year=2009 |accessdate=January 1, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229214400/http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/origins-and-development-ultimate-frisbee |archivedate=December 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Attraction to disability''' is a sexualised interest in the appearance, sensation and experience of [[disability]].&lt;ref name="limoncin" /&gt; It may extend from normal [[human sexuality]] into a type of [[sexual fetishism]]. [[Sexology|Sexologically]], the pathological end of the attraction tends to be classified as a [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref name="Money &amp; Simcoe 1986"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = J. | last2 = Simcoe | first2 = K.

==History==
Until the 1990s, it tended to be described mostly as [[acrotomophilia]], at the expense of other disabilities, or of the wish by some to pretend or acquire disability. Bruno (1997) systematised the attraction as factitious disability disorder.&lt;ref name="Bruno 1997"/&gt; A decade on, others argue that [[erotic target location error]] is at play, classifying the attraction as an identity disorder.&lt;ref name="Lawrence 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawrence 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lawrence | first1 = A. A. | title = Erotic Target Location Errors: An Underappreciated Paraphilic Dimension | doi = 10.1080/00224490902747727 | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 46 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 194–215 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19308843 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the standard psychiatric reference ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', text revision (DSM-IV-tr), the fetish falls under the general category of "Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders" and the more specific category of [[paraphilia]], or sexual fetishes;&lt;ref name="McRuer &amp; Mollow 2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=McRuer, Robert |author2=Anna Mollow |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Sex and Disability|year=2012|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822351542|pages=360–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; this classification is preserved in DSM-5.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/ray_blanchard/index_files/WAS_DSM.html |author=Blanchard, Ray |title=Paraphilias and the DSM-V: General Diagnostic Issues and Options Exemplified with Pedohebephilic Disorder. Paper presented at 19th WAS World Congress for Sexual Health, June 25, 2009, Göteborg, Sweden |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As fetish subculture==
Desires to pretend to be disabled and acquire a disability are extensions of the pathological disorder. About half of all devotees occasionally pretend (43 percent of Nattress [1996], sample of 50). Avowed "[[Body integrity identity disorder|wannabes]]" seem to number not more than five percent of the devotee-wannabe population, though Nattress (1996) found 22 percent of his sample of 50 had wanted to become disabled. Accordingly, Bruno (1997) puts those afflicted with versions of the paraphilia under the broad heading of Devotees, Pretenders, and Wannabes ('''DPW'''s), as used here.&lt;ref name="Bruno 1997"/&gt;

Well over half of DPWs have felt this pathological attraction since childhood, as typical in paraphilias. ''The Amelotatist'' (see References) found that 75 percent of its sample of 195 were aware of the attraction by age fifteen. Those attracted often cherish early memories of a sexuoerotic tragedy (a "first sighting") involving an object of their future attention, often an older member of the opposite sex, as stereotypical in paraphilic [[etiology]]. About a quarter report discovering the paraphilia in puberty and a few in maturity.

The aforesaid has given grounds for the attraction to disability to be represented as the continuum Bruno (1997) termed factitious disability disorder.&lt;ref name="Bruno 1997"/&gt; At its less-intense devotee end, there is sexualised fascination with the existential aspects of disability and its appearance. In its middle pretending area is strong desire to reproduce the sensations of disability. At its intense wannabe end is an imperative to acquire a disability which may prompt self-harm.

According to DPW fetishists, their attraction does not appear to pose dangers to DPWs' partners or third parties. However, it can be noted that the DSM-IV includes this paraphilia within the diagnostic criteria of psychiatric pathology. Fetishists raise objections to the characterization of their preference as an aberrant pathology. However, objections have also been raised by members of the disabled community on the grounds that such fetishes objectify and dehumanize them. Some people with disabilities willingly participate in the fetish subculture, for example, contributing model photos (e.g., [[Debbie van der Putten]]).

==In relationships==
''The Amelotatist'' found that 55 percent of a sample of 195 DPWs had dated disabled people, 40 percent had been sexually intimate with disabled partners, and 5 percent had current disabled spouses. Nattress (1993) found that 41 percent of a sample of 50 DPWs had, or were in, relationships with disabled partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disableddating4u.co.uk Disabled Dating]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships between DPWs and disabled people tend to be reported as being ordinary, the attraction being sated by the fact of the partner's disability. It appears that the attraction to disability is undisclosed in a proportion of DPW-disabled relationships. DPWs may press disabled partners to put their disabilities to the fore in intimate situations and exhibit them in social ones. Sexually, some DPWs have been reported to engage in active tactile observation as much as in intercourse.

That DPWs find it hard to satisfy both sexual and emotional needs is borne out in findings by both Nattress (1996) and Dixon (1983).&lt;ref name="Dixon 1983"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dixon | first1 = D. | doi = 10.1007/BF01119844 | title = An erotic attraction to amputees | journal = Sexuality and Disability | volume = 6 | pages = 3–6 | year = 1983 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They report that, despite reasonable success in obtaining sexual contact with disabled people, just 21 percent of DPWs had had long-term relationships with disabled partners.

About half of DPWs fail to establish relationships with disabled people. "Second-best" options for them are relationships with pretenders and wannabes. Practically all DPWs have experience of relationships with able-bodied partners. Such relationships are also reported to be ordinary despite the (mostly undisclosed) attraction to disability on the part of one partner.

Although it is not common knowledge within mainstream communities, the internet has revolutionized the process by which DPWs can meet each other while pursuing meaningful relationships. Some of these individuals, however, have expressed a level of concern when it comes to their first face to face encounters. While most of these encounters are completely safe, there are important guidelines to provide a sense of security to either party who may feel vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amputeedating.net/guide/meeting/ Safe Amputee Dating] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628205920/http://www.amputeedating.net/guide/meeting/ |date=June 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==
[[Psychology]] views sadism and masochism as interchangeable, with voyeurism and exhibitionism as their respective aspects. Devotees’ observation-based behavior and preference for display-minded partners seem to support explanations 2 to 4. Devotee pornography tends to display the appearance of disability across a range of activities rather than focus on sexual situations.

Recent neuroscientific research suggests that apotemnophilia has a neurological basis.&lt;ref name="Brang et al. 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brang | first1 = D. | last2 = McGeoch | first2 = P.

===Sexological===
Contemporary [[sexology]] does not consider the attraction problematic unless exercising it infringes the rights of one of the parties and/or those of third parties. Explanations include:

#[[Imprinting (psychology)|Imprinting]] or the influence of influential events on behaviour. Encountering visibly disabled people in childhood awakes strong emotions which may give rise to quasi-logical reasoning and a desire for people with the type of trauma encountered. Care received during hospital stays may awaken a wish to become disabled (as a way of ensuring continuous care), later projected onto others. Freud is credited with discovering [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] ("imprinting" in sexology) in the context of fetishism; {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}
#Implied parental approval: if, on encountering someone disabled, a future DPW’s parents express admiration, the child may conclude that disability inspires regard, later ranking it among sexual preferences. This is among explanations mentioned by Dr [[John Money]] in ''Lovemaps'';
#Flight from pressure: strict parenting and/or onerous peer environments may cause the future devotee to seek respite in sickness and disability. With time, the wish to become disabled is "[[Psychological projection|projected]]" onto others. The analogy with [[Munchausen Syndrome]] (simulating or inducing illness as a route to compassion and benefits) here is reasonably clear in wannabes. In them, projection has failed, leaving them to see themselves as more attractive if disabled. The fact that most DPWs feel the attraction since childhood also backs the above explanations. There are also suggestions that there are more DPWs in America, Europe, and the Far East due to specific parent/peer-driven achievement models there. This is another explanation mentioned in ''Lovemaps'';
#[[Inferiority complex]] causing [[psychological projection|projection]]: DPWs may have been made to feel inferior in childhood and may project their ambitions onto disabled people, who perforce have to overcome many barriers;
#'[[Darwinism]]': DPWs see disabled people as proven in natural selection, having cheated death and overcome adversity;
#The unknown: children experience fascination with and fear of the unknown when encountering a disabled person. As adolescents, they may experience similar emotions when first approaching the opposite sex. This fascination with alienness may become associated with arousal over time through [[classical conditioning]]. Eventually, arousal will be triggered by the emotion;
#"The missing phallus": When exposed to the nude female body, some men are fascinated by the fact that "the penis is missing", and there is an alternative and sexual organ (in fact, one reminiscent of a wound) in its place. This feeling of surprise may become a part of sexual attraction. The sight of a missing limb may evoke a similar feeling. Similar to 6 above, this explanation was proposed by Dr Anne Hooper in 1978;
#[[Attention seeking]] and [[envy]]: Since disabled people tend to draw more than average attention, children observing them may conclude that one has to be disabled to enjoy attention. In puberty, disability would be included in their attractiveness criteria.
#[[Erotic target location error]]: The desire of some male transvestites and transsexuals to assume the appearance of their sexual ideal was transposed by analogy to amputee wannabes by First (2005), who backs his claim with research by himself and others since 2000.&lt;ref name="First 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = First | first1 = M. B. | title = Desire for amputation of a limb: Paraphilia, psychosis, or a new type of identity disorder | doi = 10.1017/S0033291704003320 | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 919–928 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15997612| pmc = }} {{cite web|url=http://biid-info.org/images/d/d8/Desire-for-amputation-of-a-limb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120050006/http://biid-info.org/images/d/d8/Desire-for-amputation-of-a-limb.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the condition of some wannabes appears not to be primarily sexual (except by association), the explanation defines the attraction to disability as an identity disorder. It is put forward within the narrow context of amputee wannabes, and the author does not address the DPW continuum discussed above. The wannabe community has always defined itself in terms very similar to those First and Lawrence (2006) use, with the indigenous label "transabled" gaining ground by 2005 at the expense of "wannabe."

===By DPWs===
The DPW community constantly debates the origins of the attraction ("the Why?"). ''The Amelotatist'', reporting a poll of 195 devotees was a community contribution and the first synthesis of explanations. A 2005 straw poll in two DPW fora revealed that in childhood many respondents (often first or only children) felt alienated from peers, forming solitary interests in ''inter alia'', transportation, or collecting. This may indicate that [[empathy]] with the disabled, subject to exclusion in most cultures, is among the motivations for the attraction. It may also indicate that admiration is at play in the attraction, inasmuch as the disabled perforce overcome inhibitions similar to those many DPWs face, as hinted above.{{request quotation|date=October 2011}}

The '''authority''' of a text is its reliability as a witness to the author's intentions. These intentions could be initial, medial or final, but intentionalist editors (most notably represented by [[Fredson Bowers]] and [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] editing school) generally attempt to retrieve final authorial intentions. The concept is of particular importance for textual critics, whether they believe that authorial intention is recoverable, or whether they think that this recovery is impossible. 

Here are some examples of authority:

* The only authority for the works of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] poet [[Catullus]] derives from a lost manuscript, of which three copies reside in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France|National Library]] in Paris, the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]], and the [[Vatican Library]] in Rome (the ''Codex Vaticanus''). No one knows, or can ever know, how close this manuscript comes to [[Catullus]]' intentions—in other words, how great its authority is.
* It is generally thought that the Q1 ('[[Bad quarto]]') edition of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' is an [[copyright infringement|unauthorized]] copy, reconstructed from memory by one of the actors. If this is so, then it has some authority, but much less than the first authorized quarto, Q2 (1602). In comparison, however, it might be a useful authority to the cuts and adaptations made in the performance it was based on.
* The [[First Folio]] edition of ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' (1623) is the only authoritative source, since it is the copy-text of all future editions.
* A diary which is probably authentic has total authority.

A text's authority is made more problematic when it has more than one author, when it falsely asserts itself to be someone else's work, or when it is revised many times. For instance:

* The forged [[Hitler Diaries|diaries]] of [[Adolf Hitler]] have no authority as the work of their supposed author, but they do have authority as a witness to the intentions of [[Konrad Kujau]], the forger.
* A page on Wikipedia could be said to indicate the intentions of the aggregate of users who have edited it up to that point: it has multiple authority. But many of its editors will disagree with one another about what the page should contain. The idea of 'final intention' does not easily apply, since the page is never complete, and since a recent change (e.g. a piece of vandalism) might not be satisfactory to any of the other editors except the one who made it.
* The [[quarto]] edition of [[Shakespeare]]'s [[King Lear]] differs from the later [[folio (printing)|folio]] edition in many ways. Most modern versions collate the two, preferring one edition in one passage and the other in another. But some editors, such as [[Stanley Wells]], argue they are separate works with different artistic intentions, and that neither of them has more authority.

Authority can also be related to a particular edition, especially if this edition reaches a degree of popularity.

In Korean art history, the '''Baekje smile''' is the common smile motif found in [[Baekje]] sculpture and bas-relief.  Baekje figures express a unique smile that has been described as both enigmatic and subtle.  The smile has been also been characterized in many different ways from "genuinely glowing" to "thin and mild" to "unfathomable and benevolent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.museeguimet.fr/gb/pages/page_id17980_u1l2.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-06-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121125905/http://www.museeguimet.fr/gb/pages/page_id17980_u1l2.htm |archive-date=2006-11-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dynamic-korea.com/culture/view.php?main=LEC&amp;uid=200500022289]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/scu/paekche_period.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]], Baekje art was stylistically the most realistic and technically sophisticated {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.  While [[Goguryeo]] sculpture was highly rigid and [[Silla]] sculpture was formalized, Baekje sculpture exhibited distinct characteristics of warmth, softness, and used relaxed poses.  [http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9057960].  Sometimes, the Baekje style has been attributed to influence from the southern Chinese dynasties.  [http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9057960].  However, the most remarkable feature of Baekje sculpture is the distinctive Baekje smile.  [http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9057960].   The smile gives the Baekje statues a sense of friendliness and an air of pleasantness that is rarely found in other traditions of [[Buddhist]] sculpture. The smile is considered to be unique and distinctive.  [http://www.buddhamuseum.com/korean-buddha.html].

'''''Blindness''''' ({{lang-pt|Ensaio sobre a cegueira}}, meaning ''Essay on Blindness'') is a [[novel]] by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] author [[José Saramago]]. It is one of his most famous novels, along with ''[[The Gospel According to Jesus Christ]]'' and ''[[Baltasar and Blimunda]]''. In 1998, Saramago received the Nobel Prize for Literature, and ''Blindness'' was one of his works noted by the committee when announcing the award.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

==Plot summary==
''Blindness'' is the story of an unexplained mass epidemic of [[blindness]] afflicting nearly everyone in an unnamed city, and the social breakdown that swiftly follows. The novel follows the misfortunes of a handful of characters who are among the first to be stricken and centers on "the doctor's wife," her husband, several of his patients, and assorted others, who are thrown together by chance. After lengthy and traumatic quarantine in an asylum, the group bands together in a family-like unit to survive by their wits and by the unexplained good fortune that the doctor’s wife has escaped the blindness. The sudden onset and unexplained origin and nature of the blindness cause widespread panic, and the social order rapidly unravels as the government attempts to contain the apparent contagion and keep order via increasingly repressive and inept measures.

The first part of the novel follows the experiences of the central characters in the filthy, overcrowded asylum where they and other blind people have been quarantined. Hygiene, living conditions, and morale degrade horrifically in a very short period, mirroring the society outside.

Anxiety over the availability of food, caused by delivery irregularities, acts to undermine solidarity; and lack of organization prevents the internees from fairly distributing food or chores. Soldiers assigned to guard the asylum and look after the well-being of the internees become increasingly antipathetic as one soldier after another becomes infected. The military refuse to allow in basic medicines, so that a simple infection becomes deadly. Fearing a break out, soldiers shoot down a crowd of internees waiting upon food delivery.

Conditions degenerate further as an armed clique gains control over food deliveries, subjugating their fellow internees and exposing them to rape and deprivation. Faced with starvation, internees battle each other and burn down the asylum, only to discover that the army has abandoned the asylum, after which the protagonists join the throngs of nearly helpless blind people outside who wander the devastated city and fight one another to survive.

The story then follows the doctor's wife, her husband, and their impromptu “family” as they attempt to survive outside, cared for largely by the doctor’s wife, who can still see (though she must hide this fact at first). The breakdown of society is near total. Law and order, social services, government, schools, etc., no longer function. Families have been separated and cannot find each other. People squat in abandoned buildings and scrounge for food. Violence, disease, and despair threaten to overwhelm human coping. The doctor and his wife and their new “family” eventually make a permanent home in the doctor's house and are establishing a new order to their lives when the blindness lifts from the city en masse just as suddenly and inexplicably as it struck.

=== The doctor's wife===

The doctor's wife is the only character in the entire novel who does not lose her sight. This phenomenon remains unexplained in the novel. Unwilling to leave her husband to be interned, she lies to the doctors and claims to be blind. At this point she is interned with the rest of the afflicted. Once inside, she attempts to help the compound organize, but she is increasingly unable to hold back the animality of the compound. When one ward begins withholding food and demanding that the women of other wards submit to being raped in return for food, she kills the leader of their ward. Once they escape the compound, she helps her group survive in the city. The doctor's wife is the de facto leader of their small group, although in the end she often serves their disabled needs.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gradesaver.com/blindness/study-guide/character-list |title=Blindness Characters |publisher=GradeSaver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The doctor===

The doctor is an ophthalmologist stricken blind after treating a patient with what will come to be called "the white sickness". He is among the first to be quarantined along with his wife. Due to his medical expertise he has a certain authority among those quarantined. Much of this really comes from his wife not having gone blind; she is able to see what is going on on the ward and relay this to her husband. When the group from his ward finally escapes they end up travelling to and staying in the doctor and his wife's apartment. Several of the other main characters had been visiting the doctor's office when the epidemic begins to spread.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The girl with the dark glasses ===

The girl with the dark glasses is a former part-time prostitute who is struck blind while with a customer. She seemingly contracted the “white-blindness” while visiting the doctor due to conjunctivitis (hence the dark glasses). She is unceremoniously removed from the hotel and taken to the quarantine. Once inside, she joins the small group of people who were contaminated at the doctor's office. When the car thief gropes her on the way to the lavatory, she kicks him – giving him a wound from which he will eventually die. While inside, she also takes care of the boy with the squint, whose mother is nowhere to be found. At the end of the story, she and the old man with the black eye patch become lovers.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The old man with the black eye patch ===

The old man with the black eye patch is the last person to join the first ward. He brings with him a portable transistor radio that allows the internees to listen to the news. He is also the main architect of the failed attack on the ward of hoodlums hoarding the food rations. Once the group escapes the quarantine, the old man becomes the lover of the girl with the dark glasses.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The dog of tears ===

The dog of tears is a dog that joins the small group of blind when they leave the quarantine. While he is mostly loyal to the doctor's wife, he helps the whole group by protecting them all from packs of dogs who are becoming more feral by the day. He is called the dog of tears because he became attached to the group when he licked the tears off the face of the doctor's wife.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The boy with the squint ===

The boy with the squint was a patient of the doctor's, which is most likely how he became infected. He is brought to the quarantine without his mother and soon falls in with the group in the first ward. The girl with the dark glasses feeds him and takes care of him like a mother.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The car thief ===

After the first blind man was struck blind in traffic, a car thief brought him home and, subsequently stole his car. Soon after he went blind, the car thief and the first blind man re-encounter one another in the quarantine, where they soon come to blows. They have no time to resolve their issues, though, since the car thief is the first internee killed by the guards. He is gunned down while trying to ask the guards for medication for his infected leg.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The first blind man ===

The first man to go blind is struck blind in the middle of traffic, waiting at a stoplight. He is immediately taken home and then to the doctor's office, where he infects all of the other patients. He is one of the principal members of the first ward - the ward with all of the original internees. He is also the first to regain his sight, when the epidemic is finally over.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The first blind man's wife ===

The wife of the first blind man goes blind soon after helping her husband to the quarantine. They are reunited by pure chance in the quarantine. Once inside, she also joins the first ward with the doctor and the doctor's wife. When the ward of hoodlums begins to demand that the women sleep with them in order to be fed, the first blind man's wife volunteers to go, in solidarity with the others.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The man with the gun ===

The man with the gun is the leader of the ward of hoodlums that seizes control of the food supply in the quarantine. He and his ward take the rations by force and threaten to shoot anyone who doesn't comply. This ward extorts valuables from the other internees in exchange for food and, when the bracelets and watches run out, they begin to rape the women. He is later stabbed to death by the doctor's wife.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

=== The blind accountant ===

This man is not one of those afflicted by the "white sickness"—rather he has been blind since birth. He is the only one in the ward who can read and write braille and who knows how to use a walking stick. Additionally, he is the second in command to the man with the gun in the ward of hoodlums. When the doctor's wife kills the man with the gun, the blind accountant takes the gun and tries to seize control but he is unable to rally support. He dies when one of the rape victims sets fire to the ward.&lt;ref name="gradesaver.com"/&gt;

==Style==
Like most works by Saramago, the novel contains many long, breathless sentences in which commas take the place of periods, quotation marks, semicolons and colons. The lack of quotation marks around dialogue means that the speakers' identities (or the fact that dialogue is occurring) may not be immediately apparent to the reader. The lack of [[proper noun|proper]] character names in ''Blindness'' is typical of many of Saramago's novels (e.g. ''[[All the Names]]''). The characters are instead referred to by descriptive appellations such as "the doctor's wife", "the car thief", or "the first blind man". Given the characters' blindness, some of these names seem ironic ("the boy with the squint" or "the girl with the dark glasses").

The city afflicted by the blindness is  never named, nor the country specified. Few definite identifiers of culture are given, which contributes an element of timelessness and universality to the novel. Some signs hint that the country is Saramago's homeland of [[Portugal]]: the main character is shown eating [[chouriço]], a spicy sausage, and some dialogue in the original [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] employs the [[T-V distinction|familiar "tu" second-person singular]] verb form (a distinction absent in most of [[Brazil]]). The church, with all its saintly images, is likely of the Catholic variety.

==Sequel and adaptation==
Saramago wrote a sequel to ''Blindness'' in 2004, titled ''[[Seeing (novel)|Seeing]]'' (''Ensaio sobre a lucidez'', literal English translation ''Essay on lucidity''), which has also been translated into English. The new novel takes place in the same country featured in ''Blindness'' and features several of the same characters.

An English-language [[Blindness (2008 film)|film adaptation of ''Blindness'']] was directed by [[Fernando Meirelles]].  Filming began in July 2007 and stars [[Mark Ruffalo]] as the doctor and [[Julianne Moore]] as the doctor's wife. The film opened the 2008 [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

An outdoor performance adaptation by the Polish group [[Teatr KTO]], was first presented in June 2010.  It has since been performed at a number of venues,  including the [[Old College, University of Edinburgh|Old College Quad]] of Edinburgh University during the 2012 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

Shortly before his death, Saramago gave German composer Anno Schreier the rights to compose an opera based on the novel. The libretto is written in German by Kerstin Maria Pöhler. Like the German translation of the novel, the opera's title is "Die Stadt der Blinden". It saw its first performance on November 12, 2011 at the [[Zurich Opera House]].

'''Central Saint Martins''', often abbreviated to '''CSM''', is a [[public university|public]] [[tertiary education|tertiary]] [[art school]] in London, England. It is a constituent college of the [[University of the Arts London]].{{r|bus|times}} It offers full-time courses at foundation, [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]] levels, and a variety of short and summer courses.

It was formerly known as '''Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design''', and before that as '''Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design'''.{{r|aim2}}

==History==
Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design was formed in 1989 from the merger of the [[Central School of Art and Design]], founded in 1896, and [[Saint Martin's School of Art]], founded in 1854.{{r|aim2|alex}} Since 1986 both schools had been part of the [[London Institute]], formed by the [[Inner London Education Authority]] to bring together seven London art, design, fashion and media schools.{{r|hist}} The London Institute became a legal entity in 1988, could award taught degrees from 1993, was granted university status in 2003 and was renamed University of the Arts London in 2004.{{r|hist}} It also includes [[Camberwell College of Arts]], [[Chelsea College of Arts]], the [[London College of Communication]], the [[London College of Fashion]] and [[Wimbledon College of Arts]].

The [[Drama Centre London]], founded in 1963, joined Central Saint Martins in 1999 as an integral school, maintaining its name and teaching approaches. The [[Byam Shaw School of Art]], founded in 1910, was merged into Central Saint Martins in 2003.

===Central School of Art and Design===
[[File:Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design - Blue Plaque.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Central School of Art and Design, Southampton Row, Holborn, London WC1B 4AP: [[Blue Plaque]] for [[William Lethaby]], first Principal of the Central School of Arts and Crafts, placed by [[London County Council]] in 1957]]
{{main|Central School of Art and Design}}
The Central School of Art and Design was established as the Central School of Arts and Crafts in 1896 by [[London County Council]]. It grew directly from the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] of [[William Morris]] and [[John Ruskin]]. The first principal, from 1896 until 1911, was [[William Richard Lethaby]]; a [[blue plaque]] in his memory was erected in 1957.{{r|plaque}} The school was at first housed in Morley Hall, rented from the [[Regent Street Polytechnic]]. It moved to purpose-built premises in [[Southampton Row]], in the [[London Borough of Camden]], in 1908.{{r|oxford}} In the same year the [[Royal Female School of Art]], established in 1842, was merged into the school.{{r|aim25b}} Central became part of the London Institute in 1986, and merged with Saint Martin's in 1989.{{r|frieze}}

===Saint Martin's School of Art===
{{main|Saint Martin's School of Art}}
Saint Martin's School of Art was established in 1854 by [[Henry Mackenzie (bishop)|Henry Mackenzie]], [[vicar]] of the church of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]]. It became independent from the church in 1859.{{r|oxford2}} Frank Martin became head of the [[sculpture]] department in 1952; he brought in young sculptors and recent graduates of the department as teachers. Among these, [[Anthony Caro]] was particularly influential. The group around him came to be known as the New Generation of British sculptors and the sculpture department of Saint Martin's became, in the words of [[Tim Scott (artist)|Tim Scott]]: "the most famous in the art world".{{r|mclean}} Saint Martin's became part of the London Institute in 1986, and merged with Central in 1989.

===Drama Centre London===
{{Main|Drama Centre London}}
The [[Drama Centre London]] was founded in 1963 by a breakaway group of teachers and students from the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]], led by John Blatchley, [[Yat Malmgren]] and Christopher Fettes. The school is a member of [[Drama UK]]{{r|dramauk}} and its undergraduate [[Acting]] course is accredited by Drama UK.{{r|dramauk2}} The Drama Centre London merged with Central Saint Martins in 1999.

===Byam Shaw School of Art===
{{main|Byam Shaw School of Art}}

Byam Shaw School of Art was founded by the artists [[Byam Shaw|John Byam Shaw]] and [[Rex Vicat Cole]] in 1910 as a school of [[drawing]] and [[painting]]. It was originally located in Campden Street, [[Kensington]], and moved to larger premises in [[Archway, London|Archway]] in 1990. It was subsumed by Central Saint Martins in 2003.

==Awards and assessment==
In 1998 the London Institute received a [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]] for the "massive contribution" of Central Saint Martins College of Art &amp; Design to the growth of the fashion industry in Britain.{{r|royal}}  The University of the Arts London received a Queen's Anniversary Prize in 2013, for the contribution of CSM industrial and product design graduates to commerce, industry and the design profession.{{r|rat}}

CSM does not receive independent assessment in the ''[[Complete University Guide]]'' league tables, but is ranked as part of the University of the Arts London. In 2014 the university received an overall ranking of 67 out of 124 institutions, with a rank of 102 for graduate prospects and 123 for student satisfaction with teaching.{{r|indepedent|cug}} In 2018 it was placed 83rd out of 129 universities, with a rank of 125 for student satisfaction.{{r|cug2}} 

==Schools and location==
Teaching at Central Saint Martins is organised into nine programmes, which include acting, art, design, fashion, graphics and jewellery and textiles, as well as foundation courses.{{r|programmes}}

Central Saint Martins moved to a converted warehouse complex on [[Granary Square]] at [[King's Cross, London|King's Cross]] in 2011. Most of the college is housed there, but it also uses the former Byam Shaw building in Elthorne Road, [[Archway, London|Archway]], and premises in Richbell Place, [[Holborn]].{{r|locations}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5429">'''Classical theism''' is a form of [[theism]] in which [[God]] is characterized as the absolutely metaphysically ultimate being, in contrast to other conceptions such as [[pantheism]], [[panentheism]], [[polytheism]] and [[Process theology|process theism]].

Classical theism is a form of [[monotheism]]. Whereas most monotheists agree that God is, at minimum, [[omniscience|all-knowing]], [[omnipotence|all-powerful]], and [[omnibenevolent|completely good]],&lt;ref&gt;Pojman and Rea, 2&lt;/ref&gt; classical theism asserts that God is both [[Immanence|immanent]] (encompassing or manifested in the material world) and simultaneously [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] (independent of the material universe); [[Divine simplicity|simple]], and having such attributes as [[Immutability (theology)|immutability]], [[impassibility]], and timelessness.&lt;ref name="Craig98"&gt;Craig, 98&lt;/ref&gt; A key concept in classical theism is that "created beings" (ie, material phenomena, whether sentient biological organisms or insentient matter) are dependent for their existence on the one supreme divine Being. Also, although God is wholly transcendent, he not only creates the material universe but also acts upon the material universe in imposing (or organizing) a Higher Order upon that material reality. This order was called by the ancient Greeks ''[[logos]]''.

Classical theism is associated with the tradition of writers like [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plotinus]], [[Augustine]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|St. Anselm]], [[Maimonides]], [[Averroes]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name="Craig98"/&gt;  In opposition to this tradition, there are, today, philosophers like [[Alvin Plantinga]] (who rejects divine simplicity), [[Richard Swinburne]] (who rejects divine timelessness) and [[William Lane Craig]] (who rejects both divine simplicity and timelessness),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reasonablefaith.org/divine-simplicity&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/god-time-and-eternity|title=God, Time, and Eternity - Reasonable Faith|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who can be viewed as [[Theistic Personalism|theistic personalists]]. Philosophers like [[David Bentley Hart]] have defended classical theism itself in recent times.

Classical theism was almost universal among Christian theologians prior to the twentieth century. However, some of its recent critics argue that it is taken from pre-Christian philosophers and incompatible with the occasions in the Bible that describe God as emotional or changing. In defence of classical theism's compatibility with the Bible, these passages can be read in an analogous or [[allegory|allegorical]] sense as containing poetic elements, just as many other passages have also long been read. For example, Exodus 31:18&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Exodus|31:18}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes "the finger of God", and Genesis 3:8&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Genesis|3:8}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes God as noisily walking in the garden of Eden. It is inconsistent that most Christian critics of classical theism would read these latter verses in an allegorical sense, but insist that instances which describe change or passion in God are extremely literal in meaning. Moreover, whereas critics of classical theism charge that it has infiltrated Christian theology from pre-Christian roots such as [[Neoplatonism]], in fact the term "classical theism" belies crucial differences between a traditional Christian and Neoplatonic conception of God. For example, whereas [[Arius]] followed the neo-Platonist Plotinus in asserting that God could not become a physical man, [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] defended the doctrine of God's incarnation as the man Jesus, while nevertheless defending the immutability and impassibility of Jesus' divine nature. According to a traditional Christian understanding of the ''[[communicatio idiomatum]]'', it can be rightly said that God suffered and died on the cross, but only by virtue of the [[hypostatic union]] of the impassible divine word with Jesus' passible human soul and body.&lt;ref&gt;The Complete Ante-Nicene &amp; Nicene and Post-Nicene Church Fathers Collection. Catholic Way Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, while the [[church father]]s made sure to correct the classical theism of pagan sources where it was incompatible with Christianity, it can be argued that many of the modern Christian critics of classical theism are in fact themselves influenced by an overly uncritical adoption of trends within [[process theology]], which itself has non-Christian philosophical roots in the thought of [[Charles Hartshorne]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Computational Transportation  Science''' (CTS) is an emerging discipline that combines [[computer science]] and engineering with the modeling, planning, and economic aspects of [[transport]]. The discipline studies how to improve the safety, mobility, and sustainability of the transport system by taking advantage of [[information technologies]] and [[ubiquitous computing]]. A list of subjects encompassed by CTS can be found at include.&lt;ref name="dagstuhl10"/&gt;

Computational Transportation Science is an emerging discipline going beyond vehicular technology, addressing pedestrian systems on hand-held devices but also issues such as transport [[data mining]] (or movement analysis), as well as data management aspects. CTS allows for an increasing flexibility of the system as local and autonomous negotiations between transport peers, partners and supporting infrastructure are allowed. Thus, CTS provides means to study localized computing, self-organization, cooperation and simulation of transport systems.

Several academic conferences on CTS have been held up to date:
* The Fourth ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Computational Transportation Science&lt;ref name="iwcts11"/&gt;
* The Third ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Computational Transportation Science&lt;ref name="iwcts10"/&gt;
* Dagstuhl Seminar 10121 on Computational Transportation Science&lt;ref name="dagstuhl10"/&gt;
* The Second International Workshop on Computational Transportation Science&lt;ref name="iwcts09"/&gt;
* The First International Workshop on Computational Transportation Science&lt;ref name="iwcts08"/&gt;

There is also an IGERT PHD program on Computational Transportation Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago.&lt;ref name="igertPHD"/&gt;

The '''conservation and restoration of outdoor bronze artworks''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation, protection, and maintenance of [[bronze]] objects and [[artworks]] that are on view outside.   When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].

==Outdoor environmental issues==

There are a plethora of influences that the environment can have on outdoor bronze sculpture, and unfortunately there are no two identical places.  One method of conservation that works very well in one location may not work so well in another location.  A conservator needs to take into account numerous factors when preparing to work on a sculpture.  Some of these include the humidity, temperature, ultra-violet light, proximity to the sea, the amount of air pollution (especially if causing acid rain), and even what type of flora and fauna are in the area.  If the sculpture is part of a working fountain, the quality of running water (hard, soft, alkaline, acidic, etc.) is important.   How accessible the sculpture is to people and whether or not they would have the ability to climb on the sculpture is also an important factor.

According to Kipper, acid rain can be particularly harmful to bronze sculptures, because the main component is usually sulfides, or sulfuric acid, which can harm patinas and the bronze surfaces causing streaking to occur on the surface.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kipper|first=Patrick V.|title=The Care of Bronze Sculpture: Recommended Maintenance Programs for the  Collector|year=1996|publisher=Path Publications|location=Loveland, CO|isbn=0964726912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many different effects can occur on a sculpture due to being in an outdoor environment.  Just a couple of these include the formation of a black incrustation or a white powdery substance (mineral deposits) that has the potential to obscure the natural blue-green patina, or artificially applied patinas.  Pollution-formed crusts could cause the metal to deteriorate and form small pits in the metal if not removed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Bronze fountains==
Protective elements for bronze fountains are particularly important, since water is one of the leading causes for alterations or corrosion in a bronze.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite book|last=Naudé|first=Virginia N.|title=Guide to the Maintenance of Outdoor Sculpture|year=1993|publisher=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Bronze sculptures incorporated in fountains will need more layers of wax, because the spray of water will cause deterioration of the wax at a faster pace than would normally happen.  Different aspects of the water need to be monitored, including but not limited to pH, total alkalinity, and hardness or level of dissolved mineral salts.  There is a chance that the water will leave mineral deposits in a white/tan crust-like fashion.  That “crust” can cause damage or become more permanent if it comes in contact with the metal surface or a patina and needs to be periodically removed.  There are different chemical treatments that can be used to control the levels of these factors.  Usually the maintenance of fountains has to occur at a more frequent rate than other bronze sculptures as well.

==Past conservation methods==

In the late 19th century to early 20th century, one of the main ways to remove corrosion from archaeological bronze was through either chemical or electrolytic means.  Sculptures may have had only spots treated, or may have been completely submerged.  These electrochemical treatments resulted usually in the complete removal of any patina or surface material, returning the bronze to its original metal surface. Unfortunately this approach often had too severe of results, making the metal porous or leaving the surface with an unattractive appearance.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=David A.|title=Copper and Bronze in Art: Corrosion, Colorants, Conservation|year=2002|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;    This general method of treatment is still used today in some varieties, just perhaps not as severe as in the past.

Alternatively, one of these past “methods” of conserving bronze in the past was to simply not treat it at all.  Of course, as to be expected, this had widely varying results—some archaeological bronzes survived in quite good condition, while others became so fragile they could crumble.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;   Some bronzes are highly prized for their remaining original patinas, such as some of the ancient Chinese bronzes, so they purposefully do not do treatments on them.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

One method that is not all that different from treatments that are still performed now, is to dry the piece, carefully remove what corrosion is possible, and then seal the area or the whole bronze.  Other treatments have included a wide variety of substances, from “esoteric or mundane substances that range from secret concoctions to materials as prosaic as oven cleaner or lemon juice.”&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

== Contemporary conservation methods ==

===Assessment of condition===
Before any conservative action can be taken, an in-depth assessment of the sculpture or object needs to be taken.  This includes, but is not limited to, looking at past conservation reports, the taking of current photographic documentation, assessing its current structural integrity, discussion with the artist/owner as to the depth of the conservation treatment desired, and testing of new or different treatments.

According to Virginia Naudé and Glenn Wharton, there are 4 steps that come with the assessment or survey of an outdoor sculpture, which they call an “Outdoor Sculpture Condition Survey” and whose steps are as following:&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

Included are identification of materials, information on fabrication, assessments of past maintenance practices, determination of surface condition, and descriptions of structural integrity.  Also important are comments about the effects of previous routine care, repairs, or treatment.
# Maintenance recommendations for each sculpture.  These recommendations are based on the history, condition, and location of the sculpture, the resources of the owner, and the relative needs of the sculpture in the context of the whole collection.  The maintenance recommendation should include information on routine care and periodic treatment.
# Assignment of priorities to recommended activities.  The conservator assigns priorities based on the technical information gathered.  These priorities will later be assessed in relation to art historical, fund-raising, and other priorities.
# Estimate of resources required.  The labor costs of the various maintenance options proposed are expressed either in monetary figures or in hours of work required for conservators, technicians, and other specialists.  An estimate of hours is particularly useful if the recommended work will not take place immediately.  Supplies and equipment costs are also included.

===Cleaning and removal of corrosion and incrustation===

====By hand====
One method of removing particularly tough incrustations off of a sculpture is by mechanical cleaning done by an individual.  Such methods could include heating or potentially applying a solvent to a specific location to weaken the incrustation, followed by removal with a scalpel, spatula, or other such device.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dent Weil|first=Phoebe|title=Problems of Preservation of Out-Door Bronze Sculpture: Examination and Treatment of ‘The Meeting of the Waters’ in St. Louis, Missouri|journal=Bulletin of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|year=1974|volume=14|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the sculpture or object, delicate work could be done under magnification with a low-heat light.  Some tools used in this scenario are: “glass-fiber brushes, painting brushes, dental picks, a pin held in a pin vice, wooden carving tools or sticks, and small camera bellows to blow away dust.”&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

====Water blasting&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;====
Another method of cleaning bronze sculpture, especially ones that are outside, is water blasting.  Water can be pressurized at varying levels of psi, depending on what is needed for the individual case.  Different types of nozzles can direct the flow of water in unique ways, providing a versatile cleaning method. This method works particularly well on surfaces that are pitted or have large amounts of surface detail.

====Air abrasion====

=====Glass bead peening=====
Glass beads were used for a decade in the industry for the cleaning and “stress-conditioning” of metal machinery that needed to be very precisely prepared.  According to Phoebe Dent Weil,

"The beads, typically 100 µm in diameter, are highly elastic, leave no residue, and produce a metallurgically clean surface without abrasion. Unwanted scale, accretions and corrosion products are shattered and knocked off by the force of the blast, and the metal surface is peened or worked on a microscopic scale. As a result of the micro-peening, microscopic cracks and pits are sealed improving corrosion resistance.  Surface stresses in the metal are relieved and, as in the case of bronze, the metal surface is work-hardened producing a more compact crystalline structure in the metal surface and thereby prolonging the fatigue life and wearing qualities of the metal."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dent Weil|first=Phoebe|title=The Use of Glass Bead Peening to Clean Large-Scale Out-Door Bronze Sculpture|journal=Bulletin of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|year=1974|volume=15|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dent Weil tested the peening process before use and found that on average less than 1&amp;nbsp;µm of metal was lost when applied to an area of 1&amp;nbsp;cm² when blasted for 10 minutes.  Because of the rate in which the incrustation was removed, they determined that this was negligible at best.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;  They also felt that since they only actually needed to go over one section of the sculpture for a maximum of 3 seconds (a far cry from the 10-minute test) that this was the best method, as well as the fact that unlike sand-blasting no silica dust is produced and there is no fear of silicosis.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;  One slight technical difficulty that has occurred with this method is in outdoor areas of high humidity the tubes have clogged up with the beads from the moisture. One solution that was proposed and carried out to solve this issue is the use of “wet peening.”  This process includes making a “slurry” of clean water and beads, increasing the moisture until it was no longer an issue and flowed smoothly through the tubes.  Not only did this solve the problem, but it was found to have drastically reduced the amount of beads needed, as well as limit final cleanup of the area since the beads didn’t ricochet as far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Kenneth|author2=Jay W. Krueger|title=The Use of Wet Peening in the Conservation of Outdoor Bronze Sculpture|journal=Studies in Conservation|year=1979|volume=24|issue=1|pages=40, 42|doi=10.2307/1505921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to Dent Weil’s case, others have been against glass bead peening for several reasons.  Nicholas F. Veloz, A. W. Ruff, and W. Thomas Chase performed a test to see whether or not glass bead peening really did not remove any metal from the sculpture and decreased the corrosion state as believed by many.  Their findings were the opposite of these beliefs however, when they discovered that it does indeed remove metal from the surface at a higher level than would be acceptable.  They also found that microscopically the surface of the bronze had been dented and pitted with little craters that had bits of metal that would flake off when colliding with one another and becoming brittle.  Their subsequent tests also revealed that far from decreasing the rate of corrosion, glass bead peening may in fact increase the rate of atmospheric corrosion since it increases the surface area allowing for more areas to contain particles and water.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veloz|first=Nicholas F.|title=Practical Aspects of Using Walnut Shells for Cleaning Outdoor Sculpture|journal=APT Bulletin|year=1993|volume=25|issue=3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end result is that while glass bead peening may be excellent for the immediate removal of incrustation and other matter, the long-term effect may be that it could harm the sculpture, and so should be used only with much consideration.  An alternate to glass bead peening is using walnut shells, which Veloz and his associates tested in conjunction with the glass beads and is discussed in the next section.

=====Air abrasion with walnut shells=====
Using walnut shells as an air abrasive was developed as a gentler form of cleaning than sand-blasting or glass bead peening.  Veloz found that a lower pressure of air is needed than the other varieties, though still a large quantity of air is required due to the finding that using a larger nozzle seemed to be more efficient (5/16-inch or 3/8-inch nozzle to be used with 35-40 pounds per square inch gauge).  Smaller particles are more effective than larger ones (60/200 mesh, referring to particles passing through 60 wires per inch, but not 200 wires per inch).  The best angle to hold the nozzle toward the sculpture is near perpendicular, but not quite—nearing closer 15 or 20 degrees away from exactly perpendicular.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

Veloz and his associates, as afore mentioned, through multiple tests found that using walnut shells as an air abrasive caused no damaging effect to the surface of the bronze when viewed under the microscope, unlike the glass beads.  This is true because the abrasive particles have a greater elasticity than the surface of the bronze, causing them to crumple and absorb the blow instead of the bronze being the one to give under the force.  They also found that using walnut shells did not increase the rate of corrosion.  Their conclusion was that walnut shells were the superior choice of air abrasive, because it had all of the same benefits as glass beads, but none of the negative side effects.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

According to David A. Scott, Veloz, Ruff, and Chase’s findings were also confirmed by “Barbour and Lie” who did a series of tests including glass beads, 3 different types of plastic beads, sodium bicarbonate in a powder form, and walnut shells.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

== Tools and products ==

===Coating materials===
According to Naudé and Wharton, “Coating materials are selected for their durability, adhesion, ease of maintenance, and surface appearance.  The selection of an appropriate coating system is governed by the bronze surface, environmental considerations, and expected degree of maintenance.”&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

====Wax&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ====
''Clear Trewax Brand Paste Wax''

Trewax brand paste wax is made of carnauba wax (the only other natural wax aside from beeswax) suspended in turpentine  
Trewax works well on both light and dark patinas, and is fast drying.  However, if used on a warm surface it can smear or cause bulky build up (“mud pack”)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Johnson Paste Wax''

With Johnson brand paste wax there is a chance that it could cause a darkening of a lighter patina and should therefore be only used on darker patinas if that darkening is not desired.

''Renaissance Wax''

Renaissance wax is a hard wax that produces a high shine when it is buffed.  It is not always the easiest brand to find.

''Kiwi Neutral Shoe Polish''

Kiwi Neutral Shoe Polish can create a “high gloss” if desired and can be used in conjunction with Trewax brand paste wax.  It may darken light patinas, and so should only be used with medium to dark toned patinas.

''Butcher’s Wax''&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite book|last=Considine|first=Brian B.|title=Conserving Outdoor Sculpture: The Stark Collection at the Getty Center|year=2010|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butcher’s wax is composed of paraffin and carnauba waxes as its main components.

''Liberon Special Effects Waxes''&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

Liberon has pre-toned waxes for when more than clear wax is necessary.

====Sealants, lacquers and corrosion inhibitors====
''Incralac''

Incralac was developed by the International Copper Research Association. It is made of a synthetic resin with what is often referred to as a corrosion inhibitor (benzotriazole) that is very durable in outdoor conditions.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Benzoltriazole has also been referred to as a UV stabilizer rather than a corrosion inhibitor.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

''Cobratec 99''

Cobratec 99 is manufactured by Sherwin Williams Chemical Company. Cobratec 99 is a commercial grade of benzotriazole.  Care needs to be taken  (protective gloves and masks should be worn) because it is toxic if ingested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zycherman|first=Lynda A.|author2=Nicholas F. Veloz Jr.|title=Conservation of a Monumental Outdoor Bronze Sculpture: "Theodore Roosevelt" By Paul Manship|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|year=1979|volume=19|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brushes ===
A new 2-3 inch diameter soft bristled brush is a good choice for the application of wax. “Chip” brushes are easy to find in hardware stores, and are a good choice because of their natural bristles and relative inexpensiveness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Soft bristled brushes (not metallic) are usually necessary for the initial cleaning of the sculpture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Tape should be wrapped around the “ferrule” (the metal portion) on the brush so that it cannot come in direct contact with the bronze and cause scratching to occur.

===Cotton cloths===
Cotton cloths are used to buff the wax once it has been applied to the sculpture and it is fully dry.  Using a type that produces low amounts of lint is best so it does not get stuck in the wax.

===Cotton Gloves===
Cotton gloves should be worn when dealing with delicate bronze or delicate patinas, so that the oil from fingers will not further damage the piece.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Soap===
Detergents should be neutral or non-ionic for the preliminary washing of the sculpture. According to Judith M. Jacob and Glenn Wharton, “Detergents increase the wetting action of water, thereby increasing its ability to remove soiling materials. Non-ionic detergents are low in toxicity and can be easily rinsed from surfaces.”&lt;ref name="Jacob"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Judith M.|author2=Glenn Wharton|title=Caring for Outdoor Bronze Plaques, Part II: Cleaning and Waxing|journal=National Park Service: Conserve O Gram|date=September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-ionic detergents:&lt;ref name="Jacob"/&gt;

A '''crisis actor''' (aka '''actor-patient''' or '''actor victim''') is a trained [[actor]], role player, volunteer, or other person engaged to portray a disaster victim during [[safety drill|emergency drills]] to train first responders such as police, firefighters or EMT personnel. Crisis actors are used to create high-fidelity simulations of disasters in order to allow first responders to practice their skills and help emergency services organizations to prepare and train in realistic scenarios as part of full-scale disaster exercises.&lt;ref name="CrisisActors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crisis Actors.

== Disaster training simulations ==
Actors take on the role of mock victims and simulate specific injuries from a disaster to add life-like realism to an emergency exercise. Theatrical [[makeup]] and cosmetics, plus rubber and latex appliances, are often used to simulate a variety of wounds or medical conditions that realistically portray victim's injuries, a practice known as [[Moulage|medical moulage]].&lt;ref name="Merica2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bobbie J Merica|title=Medical Moulage: How to Make Your Simulations Come Alive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hX_2AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR32|date=22 November 2011|publisher=F.A.

Actors who portray news reporters, relatives of victims, and concerned citizens are also used during drills to train [[emergency operations center]] personnel to cope with a variety of emotionally-charged demands and requests.&lt;ref name="Hiatt2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charlotte J.

== Conspiracy theories and defamation ==
The term has been used by [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]] who claimed that some [[mass shootings]] and other disasters were staged, and victims and their families were being played by crisis actors. Conspiracy theorists' use of the term is thought to have originated in 2012, when a blog post by former professor and professional conspiracy theorist [[James Tracy (communication scholar)|James Tracy]] suggested that the government could have hired an [[Talent agent|acting agency]] named [[Visionbox]], which supplied crisis actors who were "trained in criminal and victim behavior, and bring intense realism to simulated mass casualty incidents in public places" to help stage the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook shooting]].

Tracy also promoted a crisis actor conspiracy theory of the [[Boston Marathon bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pammy8/what-is-a-crisis-actor-conspiracy-theory-explanation-parkland-shooting-sandy-hook|title=Where the 'Crisis Actor' Conspiracy Theory Comes From|last1=Koebler|first1=Jason|date=22 February 2018|work=Motherboard|accessdate=22 February 2018|agency=[[Vice Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/22/17036018/parkland-conspiracy-theories|title=The Parkland conspiracy theories, explained Crisis actors? The deep state?|last1=Yglesias|first1=Matthew|publisher=Vox|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conspiracy theorists have claimed such attacks are "[[false flag]] operations" staged by conspirators, usually government or corporate forces, in order to achieve some goal such as justifying increased [[government surveillance]], disarmament of the population, or military action against blamed nations or groups. Crisis actors are claimed in this context to play the part of bystanders or witnesses, emergency response personnel, and (with the aid of stage makeup) wounded victims of the attack.

Popularizers of the conspiracy theory include commentators such as [[Alex Jones]] and outlets such as ''True Pundit''.&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/us/after-orlando-shooting-false-flag-and-crisis-actor-conspiracy-theories-surface.html|title=After Orlando Shooting, 'False Flag' and 'Crisis Actor' Conspiracy Theories Surface|last1=Mele|first1=Christopher|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian12"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/21/crisis-actors-deep-state-false-flag-the-rise-of-conspiracy-theory-code-words |title=Crisis actors, deep state, false flag: the rise of conspiracy theory code words|last1=Wilson|first1=Jason|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Snopes12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/same-girl-crying-now-oregon/|title=Crisis Actors Uncovered?|publisher=Snopes |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, the parents of two children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting launched a lawsuit against Alex Jones for defamation "accusing him and his website [[InfoWars]] of engaging in a campaign of 'false, cruel, and dangerous assertions'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-lawsuit-alexjones/sandy-hook-parents-sue-conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones-for-defamation-idUSKBN1HO2FU|title=Sandy Hook parents sue conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for defamation|author=Editorial |publisher=Reuters |access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development communication has not been labeled as the "Fifth Theory of the Press", with "social transformation and development", and "the fulfillment of basic needs" as its primary purposes.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Flor, Alexander G. (2007). Development Communication Praxis, Los Banos, Laguna: University of the Philippines Open University.&lt;/ref&gt; Jamias articulated the philosophy of development communication which is anchored on three main ideas.

Nora Cruz-Quebral, ''Ph.D.'', in the lecture she delivered for an Honorary Doctorate at the London School of Economics, University of London in December 2011, clearly accounted that the Development Communication was first articulated on December 10, 1971 at the University of the Philippines in Los Banos ([[UPLB]]). At that time, the UPLB College of Agriculture held a symposium (in honor of Dr. Dioscoro L. Umali, a national scientist in the area of plant breeding) titled "In Search of Breakthroughs in Agricultural Development".&lt;ref&gt;Quebral, N. C. (2011). DevCom Los Banos Style. Lecture delivered during the Honorary Doctorate Celebration Seminar, LSE, University of London, December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent and more encompassing [[definition]] of development communication states that it is:
&lt;references group="Quebral, N. C. (2011). DevComm Los Banos Style. Lecture delivered at the Honorary Doctorate Celebration Seminar, LSE, University of London, December 2011." /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''...the art and science of human communication linked to a society's planned transformation from a state of poverty to one dynamic socio-economic growth that makes for greater equality and the larger unfolding of individual potentials.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

[[Erskine Barton Childers|Erskine Childers]] defined it as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Development support communications is a discipline in development planning and implementation in which more adequate account is taken of human behavioural factors in the design of development projects and their objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogan | first1 = C.L. | year = 1982 | title = Development journalism/communication: The status of the concept | url = | journal = [[International Communication Gazette]] | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 1–13 | doi = 10.1177/001654928202900101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the World Bank, the Development Communication is the "integration of strategic communication in development projects" based on a clear understanding of indigenous realities.{{sfn|Manyozo|2006}}

In addition, the UNICEF&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unicef.org/cbsc/|title = COMMUNICATION FOR DEVELOPMENT GOES BEYOND PROVIDING INFORMATION|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; views it as:

"...a two-way process for sharing ideas and knowledge using a range of communication tools and approaches that empower individuals and communities to take actions to improve their lives." The Thusong government center described it as "providing communities with information they can use in improving their lives, which aims at making public programmes and policies real, meaningful and sustainable".&lt;ref name="Thusong"&gt;{{cite web

Bessette (2006) defined development communication as a "planned and systematic application of communication resources, channels, approaches and strategies to support the goals of socio-economic, political and cultural development".&lt;ref name="Bassette, Guy 2006"&gt;Bassette, Guy. 2006. People, Land, and Water: Participatory Development Communication for Natural Resource Management. London: Earthscan and the International Development Research Centre&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}} Development communication is essentially participatory, because, according to Ascroft and Masilela (1994) "participation translates into individuals being active in development programmes and processes; they contribute ideas, take initiative and articulate their needs and their problems, while asserting their autonomy."&lt;ref name="Bassette, Guy 2006" /&gt;

Who are development communicators? What qualities do they possess? Nora C. Quebral&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Development Communication Primer|last = |first = |publisher = Penang: Southbound|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; gave a succinct characterization:

# They understand the process of development, the process of communication, and the environment in which the two processes interact.
# They are knowledgeable in communication skills and techniques as well as proficient in subject matter to be communicated.
# They have internalized the values inherent in equity and the unfolding of individual potential.
# They have firsthand knowledge of the several kinds of end-users of development communication.
# They have a sense of commitment, the acceptance of individual responsibility for advancing human development.

=== Concepts ===

According to Felstehausen (1973), conventional theoretical assumptions are drawn from development communications research and are challenged on the grounds that as theoretical concepts they are inadequate guides to the selection of data and the resolution of development problems. The first conceptual fallacy results from the regular practice of choosing operational examples and analogies from the experiences of developed rather than underdeveloped countries. This is especially evident in terms of a bias favoring technology (especially U.S. technology) as a correlate to communication phenomena and as a solution to development problems. The second fallacy results from the use of inappropriate and frequently untested theoretical models within communication research causing a distorted view of the role of communication in relation to social and behavioral systems. The first issue is argued by presenting a review of empirical studies which show that communication processes and the adoption of new technology does not go on apart from the factors which define the behavior of the social, economic and political system. Correlational analyses are of little value in explaining communication processes, or in establishing their role in relation to development. The second issue is addressed by suggesting that communication is to be viewed as part of a social interaction theory in which communication is treated as a process which unveils and transforms reality in the exchange of information among persons. Communication can be defined as a process of accumulating and integrating intelligence. This reformulation shifts the research focus from questions of how communication functions to change persons (senders or receivers), to how it functions to change and transform ideas. Concepts, ideas, interests and positions can then be used as the primary units of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Conceptual Limits of Development Communications Theory |last = Felstehausen|first = H.|date = January 1973|journal = Sociologia Ruralis |volume=13 |issue=1 |p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The practice of development communication began in the 1940s, but widespread application came about after [[World War II]]. The advent of [[communication sciences]] in the 1950s included recognition of the field as an academic discipline, led by [[Daniel Lerner]], [[Wilbur Schramm]] and [[Everett Rogers]]. Both Childers and Quebral stressed that DC includes all means of communication, ranging from mass media to person to person.

According to Quebral (1975), the most important feature of Philippines-style development communications is that the government is the "chief designer and administrator of the master (development) plan wherein, development communication, in this system then is purposive, persuasive, goal-directed, audience-oriented, and interventionist by nature".&lt;ref name="ManyozoAJC"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Manyozo  |first=Linje |author-link= |title=Manifesto for Development Communication: Nora C. Quebral and the Los Baños School of Development Communication |journal=[[Asian Journal of Communication]] |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=79–99 |date=March 2006  |doi= 10.1080/01292980500467632 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;  |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic schools ==

Various schools of development communication arose in response to challenges and opportunities in individual countries. Manyozo (2006) broke the field into six schools. The "Bretton Woods" school was originally dominant in international literature. The others were the Latin American, Indian, African, Los Baños and participatory schools.{{sfn|Manyozo|2006}}

=== Catholic social change ===

While not per se an academic school, the Church has been conducting "development communication" for many decades. The Catholic Church's social teachings and moral norms parallel those of social development. ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (On the New Things), for example, an encyclical written in 1891 by [[Pope Leo XIII]] critiqued social ills and promoted "the Catholic doctrine on work, the right to property, the principle of collaboration instead of class struggle as the fundamental means for social change, the rights of the weak, the dignity of the poor and the obligations of the rich, the perfecting of justice through charity, on the right to form professional associations"{{sfn|Leo XIII|1891|p=144}}In 1961, [[Pope John XXIII]], writing on the topic "Christianity and Social Progress", produced an encyclical entitled ''[[Mater et magistra]]'' (Mother and Teacher), which taught that the "Church is called in truth, justice and love to cooperate in building with all men and women an authentic communion. In this way, economic growth will not be limited to satisfying men's needs, but it will also promote their dignity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_xxiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_j-xxiii_enc_15051961_mater_en.html|title=John XXIII – Mater et Magistra |publisher=Vatican.va | page=161|year=1961|accessdate=17 October 2012|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1967, [[Pope Paul VI]] published ''[[Populorum Progressio]]''(Progressive Development). In it the Pope underscored the importance of justice, peace, and development by declaring that "development is the new name of peace". Addressing development workers, he said, "genuine progress does not consist in wealth sought for personal comfort or for its own sake; rather it consists in an economic order designed for the welfare of the human person, where the daily bread that each man receives reflects the glow of brotherly love and the helping hand of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul VI |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_26031967_populorum_en.html |title=Populorum Progressio |publisher=Vatican.va |page=86 |date=1967 |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope John VI wrote that the Church's very nature was missionary (''[[Lumen gentium]]'' – Light of the Nations), and its deepest identity (''[[Evangelii nuntiandi]]'' – Sharing the Gospel)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_p-vi_exh_19751208_evangelii-nuntiandi_en.html |title=Evangelii nuntiandi – Paolo VI |publisher=Vatican.va|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; embracing the entire life of the Church (''[[Redemptoris missio]]'' – Mission of the Redeemer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_07121990_redemptoris-missio_en.html |title=Redemptoris missio, Encyclical Letter, John Paul II|publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The content communicated through mission is transformative and liberating—manifested in the message to the poor, setting the captives free, giving sight to the blind ({{Bibleverse||Luke|4:18|KJV}}), defending the interest of ordinary laborers and the value of work (''[[Laborem exercens]]'' – Through Work),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_14091981_laborem-exercens_en.html |title=Laborem Exercens, Encyclical Letter, John Paul II, 14 September 1981|publisher=Vatican.va|date=14 September 1981 |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoting the welfare of the widows and the orphans and protecting the rights of children and infants (''[[Pacem in terris]]'' – Peace on Earth).&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_xxiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_j-xxiii_enc_11041963_pacem_en.html |title=Encyclical ''Pacem in terris'' of John XXIII, 11 April 1963 |publisher=Vatican.va |page=12 |accessdate=17 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928182928/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_xxiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_j-xxiii_enc_11041963_pacem_en.html |archivedate=28 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of engagement for social transformation and development is also asserted in the [[Catechism]] of the Catholic Church, which states that, "as far as possible citizens should take an active part in public life; the manner of this participation may vary from one country or culture to another... as with any ethical obligation, the participation of all in realizing the common good calls for a continually renewed conversion of the social partners" (pp. 1915–1916). Moreover, ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'' (Joy and Hope), commonly referred to as the Magna Carta of the Catholic Church's teaching on human dignity, states, "to satisfy the demands of justice and equity, strenuous efforts must be made, without disregarding the rights of persons or the natural qualities of each country, to remove as quickly as possible the immense economic inequalities which now exist and in many cases are growing and which are connected with individual and social discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html |title=Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern Word – ''Gaudium et spes'' |publisher=Vatican.va |pages=66 |accessdate=17 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017073250/http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html |archivedate=17 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The involvement of many organizations and individual members of the Catholic Church in highlighting the plight of the needy and reaching out to the disadvantaged through works in education, health, livelihood projects, among others, serves as a concrete example of a Church that communicates a transformative and life-changing message.&lt;ref&gt;Fahey, Tony. The Catholic Church and Social Policy. In 'The Furrow'. Vol. 49, No. 4, April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church advocates "establishing new relationships in human society, under the mastery and guidance of truth, justice, charity and freedom—relations between individual citizens, between citizens and their respective States, between States, and finally between individuals, families, intermediate associations and States on the one hand, and the world community on the other".&lt;ref name="vatican.va" /&gt; Pope John Paul II, touching in part on Quebral's (2007) thought on 'development communication in a borderless world',&lt;ref&gt;Quebral, Nora C. 2007. Reflections on Development Communication: Update on Development Communication. In 'Philippine Communication Today'. Maslog, Crispin C. Editor. Quezon City, Phil.: New Day Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; instructed Christian communicators to "interpret modern cultural needs, committing themselves to approaching the communications age not as a time of alienation and confusion, but as a valuable time for the quest for the truth and for developing communion between persons and peoples".&lt;ref&gt;Pope John Paul II. 2002. Address to the Participants in the Conference For Those Working in Communications and Culture Promoted by the Italian Bishops' Conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bretton Woods ===

The Bretton Woods school of development communication paralleled the economic strategies outlined in the [[Marshall Plan]], the [[Bretton Woods system]] and of the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] in 1944.{{sfn|Manyozo|2006}}&lt;ref name="ManyozoMazi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comminit.com/early-child/content/cfsc-pioneer-honouring-nora-quebral|title=CFSC Pioneer: Honouring Nora Quebral |last=Manyozo |first=Linje|year=2005 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The little-used name served to differentiate the original paradigm from other schools that evolved later.{{sfn|Manyozo|2005}} Leading theorists included Daniel Lerner, Wilbur Schramm and Everett Rogers. Due to his pioneering influence, Rogers was referred to as "one of the founding fathers of development communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adhikarya |first1=R. |title=A Personal Tribute to Everett Rogers |journal=Media Asia |date=20 May 2016 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=123–126 |doi=10.1080/01296612.2004.11726745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach to development communication was criticized by Latin American researchers such as [[Luis Ramiro Beltan]] and Alfonso Gumucio Dagron, because it emphasized problems in the developing nation rather than its unequal relation with developed countries. They claimed that it proposed [[industrial capitalism]] as a universal solution and that many projects failed to address obstacles such as lack of access to land, agricultural credits, and fair market prices.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Failed projects in the 1960s led to revisions.{{clarify|date=September 2013}} Manyozo found that the school had been the most dynamic in testing and adopting new approaches and methodologies.{{sfn|Manyozo|2006}}

Institutions associated with the Bretton Woods school of development communication include:
[[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO)
[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations (FAO)
[[Rockefeller Foundation]]
[[Department for International Development]], United Kingdom
[[Ford Foundation]]

=== Latin America ===

The Latin American school of development communication predates the Bretton Woods school, emerging in the 1940s with the efforts of Colombia's [[Radio Sutatenza]] and Bolivia's [[Radios Mineras]]. They pioneered participatory and educational approaches to empowering the marginalised. In effect, they served as the earliest models for [[participatory broadcasting]] efforts around the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In the 1960s [[Paolo Freire]]'s theories of [[critical pedagogy]] and Miguel Sabido's enter-educate method became important elements of the Latin American development communication school.&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Singhal, Everett M. Rogers (1999).{{google books|id=FWNPUpuLav4C|pg=49}}, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-8058-3350-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Singhal, Michael J. Cody, Everett M. Rogers, Miguel Sabido (2004).{{google books|id=FWNPUpuLav4C|pg=49}} Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-8058-4552-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influential theorists include Juan Diaz Bordenave, Luis Ramiro Beltran, and [[Alfonso Gumucio Dagron]] (Manyozo 2006, Manyozo, 2005).{{sfn|Manyozo|2006}}{{sfn|Manyozo|2005}}

In the 1990s, technological advances facilitated social change and development: new media outlets emerged, cable TV reached more regions, and the growth of local communication firms paralleled the growth of major media corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peirano|first=Luis|title=CFSC Analysis and Opinion: Developing a Unique Proposal for Communication for Development in Latin America|url=http://www.comminit.com/sbcs2016/content/cfsc-analysis-and-opinion-developing-unique-proposal-communication-development-latin-ame|work=MAZI Articles|publisher=Communication for Social Change Consortium, Inc.|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===

Organized development communication in India began with rural radio broadcasts in the 1940s. Broadcasts adopted indigenous languages to reach larger audiences.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Organized efforts in India started with community development projects in the 1950s. The government, guided by socialist ideals and politicians, started many development programs. [[Field publicity]] was employed for person-to-person communication. The radio played an important role in reaching the masses because literacy was low. Educational institutions – especially agricultural universities, through their extension networks – and international organizations under the [[United Nations]] umbrella experimented with development communication.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[Non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) relied on close inter-personal relations among communicators.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Communication from the government was more generic and unidirectional. So-called Public Information Campaigns were government-sponsored public fairs in remote areas that presented entertainment along with information on social and developmental schemes. Villagers engaged in competitions to attract attendees. Public and private organizations sponsored stalls in the main exhibition area. Development agencies and service/goods providers also attended. Some state governments employed this model.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Community radio was used in rural India. NGOs and educational institutions created local stations to broadcast information, advisories and messages on development. Local participation was encouraged. Community radio provided a platform for villagers to publicize local issues, offering the potential to elicit action from local officials.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The widespread adoption of mobile telephony in India created new channels for reaching the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Indian Phone Book| last=Doron |first=Assa |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=2 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===

The African school of development communication sprang from the continent's post-colonial and communist movements in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Anglophone Africa employed radio and theatre for community education, adult literacy, health and agricultural education (Kamlongera, 1983, Mlama, 1971).{{sfn|Manyozo|2006}}{{sfn|Manyozo|2005}}

In 1994, the [[FAO]] project "Communication for Development in Southern Africa" was a pioneer in supporting and enhancing development projects and programs through the use of participatory communication. The FAO project, placed under SADC, developed an innovative methodology known as [[Participatory Rural Communication Appraisal]] (PRCA), which combined participatory tools and techniques with a strong communication focus needed to enhance projects results and sustainability. FAO and SADC published a handbook on PRCA that was used in projects around the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The radio maintained a strong presence in research and practice into the 21st century. Radio was especially important in rural areas, as the work of the non-governmental organization [[Farm Radio International]] and its members across sub-Saharan Africa demonstrated. Knowledge exchange between development partners such as agricultural scientists and farmers were mediated through rural radio (Hambly Odame, 2003).

=== Philippines ===

Systematic study and practice began at the [[University of the Philippines Los Baños]] in the 1970s, through the establishment of the Department of Development Communication in the College of Agriculture,&lt;ref name="Quebral, N.C. 1975"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Quebral | first1 = N.C. | year = 1975 | title = Development communication: Where does it stand today? | url = | journal = Media Asia | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 197–202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which offered undergraduate and master's degrees.&lt;ref name="doi10.1177/001654928202900101"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ogan | first1 = C. L. | doi = 10.1177/001654928202900101 | title = Development Journalism/Communication: The Status of the Concept | journal = International Communication Gazette | volume = 29 | pages = 3–09 | year = 1982 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quebral coined the term "development communication" while at the university's Office of Extension and Publications, now the [[UPLB College of Development Communication|College of Development Communication]] (CDC).&lt;ref name="Quebral, N.C. 1975" /&gt;&lt;ref name="doi10.1177/001654928202900101" /&gt; According to Felix Librero, the term was first used by Quebral in her 1971 paper, "Development Communication in the Agricultural Context," presented in at a symposium at the University of the Philippines Los Baños. In her paper, Quebral argued that development communication had become a science, requiring the tasks associated with communicating development-oriented issues be based on scientific inquiry. At the time the field was limited to agricultural and rural development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Librero |first=F. |date=December 2008 |title=Development communication Los Baños style: A story behind the history. ''Development communication: Looking back, moving forward.'' Symposium |location=Meeting of the UP Alliance of Development Communication Students, UPLB College of Development Communication, Los Baños, Laguna, Philippines |url=http://www.upou.edu.ph/papers/flibrero_2009/DevcomLB_history.pdf |page=8 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130022559/http://upou.edu.ph/papers/flibrero_2009/DevcomLB_history.pdf |archivedate=30 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time the term 'development support communication' was used in [[UNDP]] programmes under Erskine Childers, with coauthor and wife, Malicca Vajrathron.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} This area of research focused on the functions of communication in promoting UN agricultural and development programmes. Development communication at Los Baños became an academic field rather than a techniques program.{{sfn|Librero|2008|pp=8–9}} Quebral cited Seers's definition of development in arguing for the term, as opposed to Childer's 'development support communication', which was used in public and in the scientific literature for the first time. Librero recounted that colleagues in agricultural communications in Los Baños agreed with Quebral, but colleagues from the field of mass communication in the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], and from countries in North America, did not initially agree, although they ultimately relented.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In 1993, in the Institute of Development Communication's faculty papers series, Alexander Flor proposed expanding the definition of development communication to include the perspective of [[cybernetics]] and [[general systems theory]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''If information counters entropy and societal breakdown is a type of entropy, then there must be a specific type of information that counters societal entropy. The exchange of such information – be it at the individual, group, or societal level – is called development communication.''&lt;ref name="upstream"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Alexander |last=Flor |title=Upstream and Downstream Interventions in Environmental Communication |version= |publisher=Institute of Development Communication |year=1993 |url= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Thailand, development communication is presently overseen by Kasetsart University through its International Center for Development Communication (ICDC).  The Center's vision is to be a leading centre of excellence in development training, communication and consultancy services.  As an extension arm of Kasetsart University its international service mission includes building and maintaining quality services to support organizations in their efforts for sustainable development in social and economic sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icdc.eto.ku.ac.th/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=119&amp;Itemid=1|title=The Location|first=|last=Administrator|website=icdc.eto.ku.ac.th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Participatory development communication ===

{{Main|Participatory development communication}}
The evolution of the [[participatory development communication]] school involved collaboration between First World and Third World development communication organizations. It focused on community involvement in development efforts and was influenced by [[Paulo Freire|Freirean]] critical pedagogy and the Los Baños school (Besette, 2004).{{sfn|Manyozo|2006}}{{sfn|Manyozo|2005}}

=== World Bank ===

The World Bank actively promotes this field through its Development Communication division and published the ''Development Communication Sourcebook'' in 2008, a resource addressing the history, concepts and practical applications of this discipline.&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org"&gt;Mefalopulos, Paulo. Development Communication Sourcebook: Broadening the Boundaries of Communication. World Bank. Retrieved from: http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTDEVCOMMENG/Resources/DevelopmentCommSourcebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Development Communication or Communication for Development'''

World Bank tends to espouse and promote the title "Development Communication" while UNICEF uses "Communication for Development". The difference seems to be a matter of semantics and not ideology since the end goals of these global organizations are almost identical to each other.

UNICEF explains: {{block quote|Communication for Development (C4D) goes beyond providing information. It involves understanding people, their beliefs and values, the social and cultural norms that shape their lives. It includes engaging communities and listening to adults and children as they identify problems, propose solutions and act upon them. Communication for development is seen as a two-way process for sharing ideas and knowledge using a range of communication tools and approaches that empower individuals and communities to take actions to improve their lives.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF http://www.unicef.org/cbsc/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[World Bank]] defines Development Communication "as an interdisciplinary field, is based on empirical research that helps to build consensus while it facilitates the sharing of knowledge to achieve a positive change in the development initiative. It is not only about effective dissemination of information but also about using empirical research and two-way communications among stakeholders". (Development Communication division, the World Bank).&lt;ref name="siteresources.worldbank.org" /&gt;

== Examples ==
One of the first examples of development communication was [[Farm Radio Forums]] in [[Canada]]. From 1941 to 1965 farmers met weekly to listen to radio programs, supplemented by printed materials and prepared questions to encourage discussion. At first, this was a response to the [[Great Depression]] and the need for increased food production in World War II. Later the Forums dealt with social and economic issues. This model of [[adult education]] or [[distance education]] was later adopted in India and Ghana.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
Radio [[DZLB-AM|DZLB]] was the community broadcasting station of UPLB College of Development Communication. It was a forerunner of the school-on-air (SOA) concept that provided informal education for farmers. DZLB hosted SOAs on nutrition, pest management and cooperatives.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Alexander |last1=Flor |first2=Ila Virginia |last2=Ongkiko |authorlink= |title=Introduction to Development Communication |version= |publisher=SEAMEO Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research and Agriculture and University of the Philippines Open University |year=2006 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2018}} DZLB aired educational programming for farmers and cooperatives.
Established in 2009, [[Global South Development Magazine]] has been a recent example of development communication in practice.
[[Instructional television]] was used in [[El Salvador]] during the 1970s to improve primary education. One problem was a lack of trained teachers. Teaching materials were improved to make them more relevant. More children attended school and graduation rates increased.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
In the 1970s in [[Korea]] the [[Planned Parenthood Federation]] succeed in lowering [[birth rate]]s and improving life in villages such as Oryu Li. It mainly used [[interpersonal communication]] in women's clubs. Oryu Li's success did not recur in all villages. The initial effort had the advantage of a remarkable local leader and visits from the provincial governor.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
A [[social marketing]] project in [[Bolivia]] in the 1980s tried to get women in the [[Cochabamba]] Valley to use [[soybean]]s in their cooking. This was an attempt to deal with chronic malnourishment among children. The project used cooking demonstrations, posters and broadcasts on local commercial radio stations. Some people tried soybeans but the outcome of the project was unclear.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
In 1999 the US and [[DC Comics]] planned to distribute 600,000 [[comic books]] to children affected by the [[Kosovo War]]. The books were in Albanian and featured [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]]. The aim was to teach children what to do when they find an unexploded [[land mine]] left over from [[Kosovo civil war|Kosovo's civil war]]. The comic books instruct children not to touch and not to move, but instead to call an adult for help.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
Since 2002, [[Journalists for Human Rights]], a [[Canada|Canadian]] NGO, has operated projects in [[Ghana]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. JHR works directly with journalists, providing monthly workshops, student sessions, on the job training and additional programs on a country by country basis.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
Cuban Media and Education - In 1961, the year of education, the well known literacy campaign was initiated. Television and radio played a complementary role in the dissemination of literacy training programs. Live coverage of literacy worker and students was used to dramatise and this was reinforced on radio and in newspapers. &lt;ref name=“:3”&gt;{{cite book |first1=A.F. |last1=Mathew |authorlink= |title=The Case of Development Communication: Perspectives, Issues and Trends |version= |publisher=Palabra Clave vol.13., No. 1 Universidad La Sanaba Columbia |year=2010 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy ==
{{split section|date=July 2018}}
Development communication policy covers formal and informal processes where interests are defined, expressed and negotiated by actors with different levels of power and with the goal of influencing policy decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mansell|first1=Robin|title=The Handbook of Global Media and Communication Policy|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|last2=Marc |first2=Raboy|authorlink=Introduction: Foundations of the Theory and Practice of Global Media and Communication Policy|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander G. Flor, Ph.D., a noted development communicator and professor at the University of the Philippines Los Banos (UPLB) and University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU), posits that development communication and the policy sciences are linked inextricably albeit distinct and mutually exclusive disciplines. "Policy sciences", he states in a nutshell, is the scientific study of policies and policy-making while "policy" is the set of decisions with specific objectives and target audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Journal of Development Communication, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.|last = |first = |date = 1991|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development communication is intended to build consensus and facilitate knowledge sharing to achieve positive change in development initiatives. It disseminates information and employs empirical research, two-way communication and dialogue among stakeholders. It is a management tool to help assess socio-political risks and opportunities. By using communication to bridge differences and take action towards change, development communication can lead to successful and sustainable results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mozammel|first=Mazud|title=Development Communication: Challenges in an Empowered Information Environment|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/Mozammel_DevComm_edit.ppt|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development communication is a response to historic, social and economic factors that limit access to information and citizen participation. These include poverty and unemployment, limited access to basic services, remote settlement patterns, lack of access to technology, lack of information, inadequate health services, lack of education and skills and lack of infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thusong Service Centre|title=The Government Development Communication Initiative: A Response to Democratic Communication and Citizen Participation in South Africa|url=http://www.thusong.gov.za/documents/policy_legal/gdc.htm|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FAO asserted that communication can play a decisive role in promoting human development. Democracy, decentralization and the market economy empower individuals and communities to control their own destinies. Stimulating awareness, participation, and capabilities are vital. Policies must encourage effective planning and implementation of communication programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Food and Agriculture Organization|title=Communication: A key to human development|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t1815e/t1815e01.htm|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee advocated that communication policies and practices require joint action among leaders in social, economic, scientific, educational and foreign affairs and that success requires constant contact and consultation with communicators and citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=John|title=Towards Realistic Communication Policies: Recent Trends and Ideas Compiled and Analyzed|year=1976|publisher=The UNESCO Press|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Habermann and De Fontgalland, the difficulties in the adoption of a viable development communication policy have to be simultaneously analyzed horizontally and vertically. Horizontally government agencies, semi-governmental offices (e.g., rural extension service), independent development organizations and private media outlets must coordinate policy. Vertically, information must flow in both directions between the population base and decision-making bodies. This involves local and supra-local administrations that are active in handing out directives and reporting back to the government. Commonly, default policies do not encourage/require such institutions to feed information from the populace to policymakers, with the exception of government extension bureaus.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Stakeholder analysis ===
{{Main|Stakeholder analysis}}

The design and implementation of policies is becoming more complex, and the number and type of actors involved in policy implementation more diverse;&lt;ref name=EVAL /&gt; hence, the policy process is evolving towards multi-actor and multi-goal situations.&lt;ref name=CL&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carlsson|first=L|title=Non-hierarchical Evaluation of Policy|journal=Evaluation|year=2000|volume=6|pages=201–216|doi=10.1177/13563890022209217}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Project stakeholder|Stakeholder]]" has been variously defined according to the goal of the analysis, the analytic approach or the policy area. Where several groups of stakeholders are involved in the policy process, a stakeholder analysis can provide a useful resource.

Stakeholder analysis can help analyze the behavior, intentions, interrelations, agendas, interests and the resources of stakeholders in the policy processes.&lt;ref name=EVAL /&gt;  Crosby described stakeholder analysis as offering methods and approaches to analyze the interests and roles of key players. Hannan and Freeman include groups or individual who can affect or be affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives, while others exclude those who cannot influence the outcome. For instance, Brugha and Varvasovszky defined stakeholder as "individuals, groups, and organizations who have an interest (stake) and the potential to influence the actions and aims of an organization, project, or policy direction."&lt;ref name=EVAL&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mehrizi | first1 = M.

Government – Enacts all communication policies, making it the most powerful stakeholder.
Education sector – Conducts research that underlies subsequent policies.
Communication industry – Influences communication policies. May adopt self-regulation to avoid/delay government regulation. For example, the [[Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster sa Pilipinas]] and the Philippine Press Institute institute [[ethics codes]].
Private sector – Avoid policies that limit content and to protect themselves from opponents.
Religious sector – Traditionally opposes policies that allow obscenity, violence and profanity to be distributed.
Foreign interests – e.g., international lending agencies may demand the end of monopolies—including state media entities—as a condition for financial aid.
Consumers – Traditionally not consulted, but more recently claiming to protect the public interest.

The United Nations has recognised the importance of "the need to support two-way communication systems that enable dialogue and that allow communities to express their aspirations and concerns and participate in decisions...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNESCO|title=UN Agencies and Communication for Development|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=21370&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such two-way interactions can help expose local reality.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Historical perspectives ===
{{See also|History of communication}}

Cuilenburg and McQuail (2003) identify three main phases of communications policy-making:&lt;ref name="EJC (McQuail)"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Cuilenburg | first1 = J. | last2 = McQuail | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1177/0267323103018002002 | title = Media Policy Paradigm Shifts: Towards a New Communications Policy Paradigm | journal = European Journal of Communication | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–207 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 Emerging Communications Industry Policy (until the Second World War)—during this era, communications policy mainly supported state and corporate benefits. Policy-covered telegraph, telephony and wireless and later, cinema.&lt;!--what about the press?--&gt; Policies were ad hoc measures designed to facilitate a series of technical innovations.&lt;ref name="EJC (McQuail)" /&gt;
Public Service Media Policy (1945–1980)—After the Second World War, policy was dominated by sociopolitical rather than economic and national strategic concerns. This phase began after the Second World War. Policy expanded from addressing technical matters to the content of communications and to cover the traditional press.&lt;ref name="EJC (McQuail)" /&gt;
New Communications Policy Paradigm (1980 to present)—Technological, economic and social trends fundamentally changed media policy from 1980 onward. Technological convergence became an agenda item when the US [[Office of Technology Assessment]] published its pioneering study, ''Critical Connections'' (OTA, 1990) followed by the European Union (CEC, 1997). "Convergence" meant that the boundaries between information technologies blurred: computer and telecommunications converged to telematics; personal computers and television become more similar; and formerly separated networks become interconnected. Regulation of mass media became increasingly linked to telecommunications regulation. Globalization and the permeability of national frontiers by multinational media limited the impact of policy in most countries.&lt;ref name="EJC (McQuail)" /&gt;

=== Critiques ===

Development communication policy as a field experienced persistent conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=R.|title=Television: Technology and Cultural Form|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates operated within the discourse of each period: autonomous vs. dependent in the 50s;{{clarify|date=September 2013}} unequal North-South communication flows in the 60s and 70s; transnational corporations and non-governmental actors in the 80s; the converged global information society and the market-based media structure in the 90s; and online media and the [[digital divide]] in the 2000s.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

==== Participation ====
Hamelink and Nordenstreng called for multistakeholder participation in [[information and communications technology]] (ICT) governance and for formal and informal policy development mechanisms to enable state and non-state actors to shape the media and communication industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamelink|first=C.|author2=Nordenstreng, K.|title=Towards Democratic Media Governance. Media Between Culture and Commerce|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Funding agency bias ====

Manyozo advocated a rethinking of communication for development policies, perceiving a failure by communication policy makers to identify funding institutions that encourage cultural imperialism and unequal power relations between Western and local organizations. He attributed this to the absence in communication policy debates of a political economy discourse.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Manyozo, Linje (2011). Rethinking Communication for Development Policy: Some Considerations,  in R. Mansell and M. Raboy (eds.), The Handbook of Global Media and Communication Policy,  Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell, pp. 319–335.&lt;/ref&gt;  In reviewing the different approaches to communication for development policies—media, participation and community dialogue—Manyozo criticizes groups that emphasizes one over the others.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Development communication policy science ===
{{Main|Development communication policy science}}

Development communication policy science take off from development theory that which it says that policy recommendation becomes an engine to the process of social change&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jan|first1=Servaes|title=Development Theory and Communication Policy: Power to the People!|journal=European Journal of Communication|doi=10.1177/0267323186001002006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Servaes, 1986).  The concept of development communication policy science has reference to the following:
a) Diffusion model which enunciates that 'that the role of communication was (1) to transfer technological innovations from development agencies to their clients, and (2) to create an appetite for change through raising a 'climate for modernization' among the members of the public'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Everett|first1=Rogers|title=Communication technology: the new media in society|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
b) The participatory model which incorporates the concept of multiplicity development through democratization and participation at all levels – international, national, local and individual but values the cultural identity of local communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jan|first1=Servaes|title=Development communication – for whom and for what? Communicatio|doi=10.1080/02500169508537827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flor recognizes the affinity of Development Communication and Policy Science; hence coined “Development Communication Policy Science”. In his writings, this concept can be deduced to mean creating guidelines that “stems from the need for actively applying knowledge from and principles of the social sciences in solving large-scale societal problems under conditions of social change” and of which in the process communication is a critical variable.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

UNESCO posits that in order to effect positive developmental change, there is a need to form people and processes that facilitate the creation of knowledge.  For development to happen, a two-way horizontal model which allow direct participation of those most affected by the development issue(s) can be adopted. In this model, the stakeholder's participation are in a form of defining and implementing solutions and identifying development directions. Engaging in dialogue with stakeholders for purposes of understanding their perceptions, perspectives, values, attitudes and practices are essential inputs to the design and implementation of development initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=UNESCO|title=Communication for Development and Social Change|date=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development communication policy science is a thriving and a contemporary field in social sciences.&lt;ref name=Calhoun2011&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Calhoun |first=Craig |date=2011 |title=Communication as Social Science (and More) |journal=International Journal of Communication 5 |pages=1479–1496 |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/files/ahcs/communication_as_social_science_and_more.pdf |access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the application of the policy sciences to improve policy development, implementation and evaluation in the development communication context. According to Flor (1991), development communication and policy sciences are regarded as distinct and mutually exclusive areas of study but are inextricably linked. He added that development communication and the policy sciences, although different in scope, stem from the same rationale: the need for actively applying knowledge from the principles&lt;ref name=Calhoun2011 /&gt; of social sciences in solving large-scale societal problems under conditions of social change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Separately, development communication is a purposive, pragmatic, and value-laden development intervention while the policy sciences are the scientific study of policies and policy-making for the social good.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both endorse a normative or prescriptive role for the social sciences, work to alleviate societal problems and recognize communication's important function (Ongkiko &amp; Flor, 2006). As an academic discipline, development communication policy science is the study of the use of the art and the science of policy in the development communication context.
Development communication's ultimate goal is to catalyze local development activities, local development planning and implementation, and local communication to smoothen the path to development. It is the science which uses communication to educate, change and motivate people's attitudes and values leading to developmental goals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cfamedia.org/main/|title=Communication Foundation for Asia {{!}} Media for Total Human Development|website=cfamedia.org|language=English|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy is a term which frames the action rather than simply describing it (Colebatch, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Colebatch, H.K. (2002). Policy. PA: Open University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it labels what we see so that we can make sense of it in a particular way. Understanding policy means understanding the way in which practitioners use it to shape action. It leads us to ask who is involved in what setting, how the action is framed and what significance in this process of the idea of authorized purpose, and not simply an outcome. Indeed, the "approach of the policy science is forward-looking and anticipatory".

The two fields are undoubtedly different. However, Flor&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; accurately stated that "both stem from the same rationale: the need for actively applying knowledge and principles of the social sciences in solving large-scale societal problems under conditions of social change". The connection between the two fields will be apparent once the question, 'what is the policy for?' is answered. Since policy is the pursuit of goals and the effect they have on the action; and development communication aims to facilitate social change, the two processes are represented as a sequence of stages in the development, beginning with the thought and the intention (policy), moving through action brought about by communication, and ending with the solution (action). To reiterate, unless the policy decision could shape the action, there would be no point in making it.

When policy sciences and development communication have been firmly established in an organization or community, the instruments of policy analysis will provide "unprecedented versatility and effectiveness" (Lasswell, 1969).&lt;ref&gt;Lasswell, H. (1969). A Preview of policy sciences. http://www.policysciences.org/classics/preview.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the practice and application of social marketing strategies to influence the stakeholders in making decisions to create not only an individual but also social change.

==== Policy sciences ====

Lasswell (1970: 3)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Pre-view of Policy Sciences|last=Lasswell|first=Harold|publisher=American Elsevier|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines policy sciences as ''knowledge of the policy process as well as knowledge in this process''. Torgerson (1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torgerson|first=Douglas|date=1985|title=Contextual Orientation in Policy Analysis: The Contribution of Harold D. Lasswell|url=|journal=Policy Sciences|volume=18|pages=241–261|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that Lasswell proposed the development of policy science-or policy sciences-as an interdisciplinary field to embrace all the social sciences and to produce knowledge applicable to public problems. The term "policy sciences" in its plural form, therefore, emphasizes its interdisciplinary nature (Flor, 1991). According to Hale (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=Ben|date=2011|title=The methods of applied philosophy and the tools of the policy sciences|url=|journal=International Journal of Applied Philosophy|volume=25|pages=215–232|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the central aim of policy sciences is to resolve problems [in the service of human dignity] and the diverse human, historical, and contextual element in public policy-making. This is a reiteration of the Lasswellian maxim on public policy in the following key elements: "contextual"; "problem-oriented"; "multi-method inquiry" or diverse empirical methods, "political", "normative, welfare-oriented" in the case of social policy goals; and posing "interdisciplinarity" or moving between humanities and social sciences. Indeed, Lasswell's original goal of the policy sciences was to provide, "intelligence pertinent to the integration of values realized by and embodied by interpersonal relations [such as] human dignity and the realization of human capacities" (Lasswell and Kaplan, 1950: p. xii).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power and Society|last=Lasswell |first=Harold |last2=Kaplan |first2=Abraham |publisher=Yale University Press|year=1950|isbn=|location=New Haven, CT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "policy sciences" therefore adopts an approach to understanding and solving problems that draw on and contribute to all fields of knowledge (Quebral, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quebral|first=Nora|date=2006|title=Development Communication in a Borderless World|url=|journal=Glocal Times|volume=3|pages=1–5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sets out procedures in an integrated and comprehensive form to help clarify and secure common interests.

According to [[Harold Lasswell]] (1971), the policy sciences are concerned with the knowledge ''of'' and ''in'' the decision processes of the public and civic order.&lt;ref name="Laswell, H.D. 1971"&gt;Laswell, H.D. (1971). [http://www.policysciences.org/classics/preview.pdf A Preview of Policy Sciences]. American Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;   Knowledge of decision processes points to the empirical and scientific understanding of how policies are made and executed. At one moment, the analyst regards his subject-matter as an objective phenomenon, but this phase alternates with another in which the analyst comes to view himself as actively involved in the phenomenon which he investigates. Inquiry displays both tension and interplay between these moments; they are distinct yet interwoven, complementary in the ongoing development and refinement of contextual orientation (Togerson, 1985). Empirical knowledge pertains to those generated through scientific inquiry and observation as applied to decision processes. As such, the notion of the policy sciences is construed in various shades since it was introduced in the 1940s and over the years, Lasswell and his colleagues refined the concept, through practice and peer review, as the intellectual tools needed to support problem-oriented, contextual, and multi-method inquiry in the service of human dignity for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/UCB/TheUniversity/Committees/SPS/F/courses/psci5076.html|title=Introduction to the Policy Sciences|last=Brunner|first=Ronald|date=1996|website=PSCI5076: Introduction to Policy Sciences|publisher=University of Colorado|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy sciences is a forward-looking body of knowledge, with the plural form emphasizing its interdisciplinary and holistic nature.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1978), cited in Flor, Alexander (1991). Development Communication and the Policy Sciences. ''Journal of Development Communication''. Kuala Lumpur: Asian Institute of Development Communication&lt;/ref&gt;  It recognizes the multiplicity of factors affecting certain problems and multi-dimensions of certain phenomena that are subject to decision processes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  According to Laswell (1971, p.&amp;nbsp;39),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Pre-View of Policy Sciences|last=Lasswell|first=Harold|publisher=American Elsevier Publishing Company|year=1971|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an adequate strategy of problem solving in policy sciences encompasses five intellectual tasks performed at varying levels of insight and understanding namely: goal clarification; trend description; analysis of conditions; projection of developments; and invention, evaluation, and selection of alternatives. As such, the emphasis of policy sciences is on applying scientific or empirical evidences in understanding problems so that more realistic, responsive and effective interventions are identified and implemented.  Since a problem is multidimensional, various scientific disciplines are needed to form a comprehensive analysis of a certain phenomenon. The trend toward a policy sciences viewpoint is a move away from fragmentation and the fragmented "worm's eye view" of policy matters.&lt;ref name="Laswell, H.D. 1971" /&gt;

The policy sciences provide an integrated and comprehensive approach for addressing issues and problems at all levels in ways that help clarify and secure the common interest. Policy sciences are concerned with helping people make better decisions toward fostering human dignity for all. Since we are living in a "turbulent field" environment, policy science is necessary to address issues before it will get bigger. The approach of policy sciences,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Flor, Alexander G. (December 1991). [https://www.academia.edu/578845/Development_Communication_and_the_Policy_Sciences "Development Communication and the Policy Sciences".] ''Journal of Development Communication'', Kuala Lumpur: Asian Institute of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt; as cited by Flor in his article, is forward-looking or anticipatory. Policy sciences tell us what we need to do and prepare before certain issues or problems occur. Using an allegorical definition, Dror (1971), as cited by Ongkiko and Flor (2006), explains that "''one should not leave the problem of crossing a river until the river is reached; rather, one should survey the territory in advance, identify rivers flowing through it, decide whether it is at all necessary to cross the river—and if so, where and how to cross it—then prepare in advance the materials for crossing the river and design a logistics network so that the material is ready when the river is reached.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, given its interdisciplinary and holistic nature, policy sciences does consider several variables (education, communication, money, culture) in coming up with a decision. These variables are important factors in coming up with a sound and relevant policy.

In the context of communication policy development, the policy sciences are necessary to make more purposeful, responsive, and effective communication policies. Profoundly influenced by Freud and Marx, Lasswell emphasized the importance of the contextual orientation of policy analysts, both individually and collectively (Lasswell, 1965). When he first articulated this principle of contextuality, Lasswell indeed referred explicitly to the "exposition of the dialectical method" (1965)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Revolution of Our Time: A Framework for Basic Policy Research|last=Harold D. Lasswell|first=in Harold Lasswell and Daniel Lerner (Eds) World Revolutionary Elites|publisher=MIT Press|year=1965|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=29–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Lukacs's ''History and Class Consciousness'', adding that the insights of psychoanalysis provided a complement to the Marxian dialectic which would aid in understanding "the symbolic aspects of historical development" (Laswell, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;19). Here Lasswell proposed a mode of contextual-configurative analysis whereby, through "an act of creative orientation" (Laasswell, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;13), the inquirer could locate himself in an 'all-encompassing totality" (Lasswell, 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;12). In this regard, Lasswell considered such contextual orientation indispensable to the conduct of rational inquiry, and urged the use of contextual-configurative analysis in the development of a policy science profession. Hale (2011, p.&amp;nbsp;221)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=Ben|date=2011|title=The Methods of Applied Philosophy and the Tools of the Policy Sciences|url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/2011.37.pdf|journal=International Journal of Applied Philosophy|volume=25|pages=215–232.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; contends that Lasswell saw that robust policy solutions could only be obtained by insisting upon a commitment to contextuality, problem orientation, and methodological diversity. All for good reasons: first, no decision can adequately be understood apart from the larger social process in which it is itself apart. Thus '''contextuality''' is a key element in the policy sciences. As a reliance on ideology, principle, and grand historical projects cannot, given the complexity and contextuality of policy problems, serve with reliable solution, a discipline geared to resolve problems should expressly orient itself on those problems and should be purposeful. Thus '''problem orientation''' is the second key element in the policy sciences. Finally, due to the multidimensionality and complexity of many of these problems it stands to reason that the policy scientist should draw from a diversity of methodologies. Thus '''methodological diversity''' is the third key element in the policy sciences. It is Lasswell's sincere belief that understanding the policy formation and decision-making process will eventually also be beneficial in the creation of public policy (Hale, 2011).

[https://tidsskrift.dk/mediekultur/article/view/21614 Hepp, A., Roitsch, C., &amp; Berg, M. (2016)] introduces the approach of contextualised communication network analysis as a qualitative procedure for researching communicative relationships realised through the media. It combines qualitative interviews on media appropriation, egocentric network maps, and media diaries. Through the triangulation of these methods of data collection, it is possible to gain a differentiated insight into the specific meanings, structures and processes of communication networks across a variety of media. The approach is illustrated using a recent study dealing with the mediatisation of community building among young people. In this context, the qualitative communication network analysis has been applied to distinguish “localists” from “centrists”, “multilocalists”, and “pluralists”. These different “horizons of mediatised communitisation” are connected to distinct communication networks. Since this involves today a variety of different media, the contextual analysis of communication networks necessarily has to imply a cross-media perspective.

[https://academic.oup.com/rev/article/26/4/302/3916737 Oancea, A., Florez Petour, T., and Atkinson, J. (2017)] noted a particular advantage of qualitative network analysis tools approach in its fit to the study of cultural value and impact in different disciplinary and institutional settings.

Sciences are policy sciences when they clarify the process of policy-making in society or supply data for the making of rational judgments on policy questions" Lasswell (1975). The 'art' of policy sciences, therefore, seek to improve decision-making by reinforcing and supporting human dignity to elide the blinders of instrumental reason by addressing the manifold of human experience (Hale, 2001). The personalities who significantly play vital roles in this field are the policy scientists and analysts who are involved in the scientific design, formulation, analysis, and evaluation of policies in particular and are concerned with the study of the policy-making process in general (Flor, 1991). Lasswell and McDougal&lt;ref name="Policy Sciences in Action" /&gt; called on "policy scientists to aid decision makers in clarifying goals, identifying trends relative to goals, analyzing the factors causing or contributing to specific trends, projecting the future, and inventing and evaluating policy proposals—alternative actions that may be taken related to the desired results." To ensure that policy scientists would be adequately equipped for these intellectual tasks, Lasswell and McDougal proposed educational training programs devoted to the knowledge and skills needed for better policy (decision) making: contextual thinking, problem orientation, and mastery of diverse methods.&lt;ref name="Policy Sciences in Action" /&gt;

To guide communication policy-makers in addressing challenges, Picard and Pickard (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Picard, R.G. and Pickard, V. (2017). Essential Principles for Contemporary Media and Communications Policymaking. Retrieved from https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2017-11/Essential%20Principles%20for%20Contemporary%20Media%20and%20Communications%20Policymaking.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; proposed policy principles that aim to guide contemporary media and communications policymaking in democratic countries so the contributions of these operations and systems to society may be improved.   They maintain that “Media and communications policies are central to many of the social and political issues that societies face today.” However, existing policies are often unable to respond to rapid technological, economic, political, and social developments because they address only particular media and communication challenges at a particular time.  On the other hand, fundamental principles are constant, thus providing guidance on how to respond to new concerns and challenges and making appropriate policies.

Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. University of Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; note that "policy principles are coherent statements based on underlying norms and values that help policymakers and organisations respond to issues and take part in legislative and regulatory activities". In practice, principles are articulated and then used to set policy objectives and determine the means to achieve them. The latter two stages opine Picard and Pickard (2017), are subjected to ''political'' processes that determine the final policy outcome.

Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. University of Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; therefore came up with the following rubric list of potential principles that they believe are crucial in crafting a much reflective communication policy:

# Meeting fundamental communication and content needs;
# Providing effective ability for public use of media and communications;
# Promoting diversity/plurality in ownership of media and content available;
# Affording protection for users and society;
# Providing transparency and accountability;
# Pursuing developmental and economic benefits; and
# Pursuing equitable and effective policy outcomes.

The authors (Picard and Pickard, 2017) disaggregated these key principles as follows:

Principles are therefore not neutral, because they are normative, reflecting specific values that are subject to contestation.

"Communication and Culture, Conflict and Cohesion" is a book edited by Alexander G. Flor (2002), an expert on Knowledge Management for Development, which discusses the need for convergence in society through inter-cultural communication, using case studies in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It also examines environmental conflicts, indigenous peoples, and the official development assistance in the Philippines. In the book, Flor noted that communication and culture are “inextricably linked”. Societal conflict in this age of informatization is a “function of culture caused by a dysfunction of societal communication”. The quality and degree of societal communication – the mass media and education -- determine the ways that cultures are exposed to others. The higher the quality and degree of inter-cultural communication, the lower the propensity for conflict, and vice versa. He observed that many of the world’s contemporary wars – in Rwanda, Basque, Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Aceh, East Timor -- are not being waged by national political struggles “but by cultures”. For example, Catholic bishops and Islam ulama agree that the conflict in the island of Mindanao in the Philippines is triggered by “opposing value systems (on the use of natural resources), opposing social structures (feudal vs. oligarchic), and opposing worldviews (materialistic vs. idealistic)” – all of which, Flor noted, are components of culture. One of the first steps to help repair the situation is for communication policy scientists to “begin with tolerance as a short-term solution, and understanding as a long-term solution”. Tolerance and understanding require “good communication” from both ends of the spectrum that are striving to achieve “mutual understanding” – the goal of Kincaid (1979) for communication in his Convergence Model. The concept of convergence looks at the communication process as cyclical between source and receiver, and interactive between their message and feedback. “With convergence comes cohesion.” Mutual understanding achieved through communication helps preclude conflicts, and encourages cohesion among the world’s cultures.

==== Communication policy science ====
The atmosphere of participation created by recent administrations has brought about a more significant role for the development communication specialist/ policy scientist. His involvement in communication policymaking is facilitated by the so-called institutionalization of people power. His expertise may be directly tapped by the most important stakeholder, the media consumer. The participation of information users and media consumers in policy making may be realized by the formation of a nationwide media consumer's organization or a federation of local organizations of this nature in which policy analysts play a significant role. This proposed organization could initiate media education in the formal and non-formal modes. Media education at the formal level may be facilitated by lobbying for the inclusion of such in existing secondary and tertiary curricula. Non-formal education may be conducted through media consumer sponsored awareness campaigns. This organization could also conduct its own audience related studies and policy research. It could establish a nationwide network involving the church, academic communities, grassroots organizations and cause-oriented groups. Communication policy scientists may also serve as part of the staff of our legislators in the Congress and Senate. In their private capacities, they can form research and development outfits or "think tanks" whose services may be availed of by government agencies. Indeed, now is a fortuitous time for policy engagement in development communication.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

Culture, politics, economics and technology have an impact on policy decisions.  In order to investigate the factors that influence communications policy, one has to go beyond conventional views of media and communication and should combine these with policy studies.

According to experts, communication policy science would be understood if the public just had access to the right scientific information. Coyle, in his article "Theory of Development Communication", articulates that people have options to change their ways of life through communication. People improve their lives and ways of thinking through communication, sharing their perspectives and understanding what is going on in their surroundings. As highlighted by Flor, communication development has something to do with policy science as these are anchored for improving policy making.

As stipulated in Walt Rostow's theory in Boado's article, societies progress through specific stages of development on their way to modernity. Policy makers and scientists can communicate directly with the public through social media and blogging. By using social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook, policymakers and scientists can serve as critical mediators in disseminating scientific information by sharing advancements directly with society.

=====Communication policy and its dimensions=====

John A.R. Lee, author of ''Towards Realistic Communication Policies: Recent Trends and Ideas Compiled and Analysed'', published by The Unesco Press, shares that every state or nation carries communication policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0001/000165/016578eo.pdf|title=Towards Realistic Communication Policies: Recent Trends and Ideas Compiled and Analysed|last=Lee|first=John|date=1976|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120001913/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0001/000165/016578eo.pdf|archivedate=20 November 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These policies are stated/embedded in "legislation, conditions, codes of conduct, rules and proceedings" or implied/suggested "in accepted practices." He adds that they are present "at the national, institutional and professional levels."

By citing a Unesco report made by experts on communication and planning, Lee defines communication policies as "sets of principles and norms established to guide the behaviour of communication systems."

He adds that the dimensions of communication policies as well as communication planning encompass the communication system, its components and structures; the functions of the system; the "clients" or audience using the system; the types of information carried by the system and its components; the values and qualities of the information content; and a variety of considerations about the system, its functions, audience, types of information and qualities. Members of the audience are classified based on such characteristics as age, sex, occupations, socio-economic strata, urban-rural (locations) and persuasions. Types of information refer to the conversation, cultural forms, data, education, entertainment, general information, music, news and opinion. Meanwhile, truth, objectivity, relevance, educational effectiveness, violence, humour, sex, libel are examples of values and qualities of the information content.

According to Lee, the "consideration, identification and determination" of the scope of specific communication systems and societal principles and norms are needed in formulating communication policies.

In his paper, Lee also discusses participation in the formulation of communication policies by asking, "Who is involved?" and identifying the stakeholders. They are government executive, legislative bodies, authorities in charge of social and economic planning, individual ministries and their planning boards, communication enterprises, professional organizations, the citizen, the social scientist and the economist.

E. Lloyd Sommerland, UNESCO Regional Communication Adviser for Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000397/039772eb.pdf|title=Why a Communication Policy and Plan|last=Sommerland|first=E. Lloyd|date=1976|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; points out the difference between communication policies and communication planning by saying that the former provides "the principles, rules and guidelines on which the communication system is built," while the latter is concerned with the policy implementation.

He shares that every country engages in development planning that touches different sectors of a society like "agriculture, manufacturing, commerce, education, health, transport and communication, social and community services." At the heart of these plans for development is communication. "Communication is part and parcel of this whole process of development and needs its own infrastructure," said Summerland. The word "communication" in this particular context includes telecommunications, mass media (print and broadcast), face-to-face communication and traditional channels and these are resources tapped by a society "to enable information to flow within it", he adds.

The author emphasizes the role of communication in national development.

Sommerland also underlines that communication policies are not the ends and they provide a framework for action. He makes a reference to what a UNESCO expert group has said that behind these policies is strategic planning.

"(It) determines the alternative ways to achieve long-range goals and sets the frame of reference for shorter-range operational planning. Strategic planning translates into quantified targets and systematic approaches, the general objectives of communication policies," he says.

Sommerland also supports some claims of Lee that communication policies are either embedded or implied in the existing policies of a nation.

"For a country to try and formulate a coherent national communication policy does not, of course, imply that no policies in this area already exist," the former says. "...Because communication is interdisciplinary and because it is the thread which binds a nation together, communication policies even if incomplete and implicit, are to be found in many different parts of a political and social system.

==== Development communication and policy sciences as mutually constitutive fields ====
Development communication and policy sciences exhibits mutuality as catalysts of change in this fluid environment. Both are geared towards effecting change in society. Will these two sciences be robustly beneficial if converged in one developmental framework? Allen (as cited in Flor, 1991) postulates that policy is a science of decision-making based on empirical data gathered from observation.&lt;ref name="AGF" /&gt; One important characteristic of policies is, it is created to facilitate civic order, an agent to development process. How does it relate to development communication? Although a relatively young science, Development Communication has now been recognized and adopted by various agencies: the government and private sector as a means to institute effective changes using bottom-up approach. In the same vein, policy sciences grew out of this need to reorient actively the social sciences to the resolution of policy issues.&lt;ref name="AGF" /&gt; Recognizing that every human being is a value-shaper and sharer in the social process, interaction as whole has been considered systemically by both sciences. A policy science is anchored on its ''intelligence'' function, followed by mobilization and bureaucratic reforms where mobilization is a key component of development communication. Development communication practitioners are well-equipped when it comes to understanding social phenomena which can aid in the ''intelligence function'' of policy scientists. The development agenda of both sciences are anchored on ''contextuality,'' meaning both recognizes the human's social values and institutions in drafting interventions, plans and policies to achieve an ''enlightened society''.

These policies are products of Development Communication initiatives that can influence decision makers or the government in enacting pertinent laws for the benefit of the publics. Development communication's process is akin to policy science as both recognizes the context or the environment where humans socially interact. Both are using social science procedures in solving large-scale problems&lt;ref name="AGF" /&gt; and further acknowledges communication as an integral part of the process. Hence one can surmise that policy decision-making is dependent on communication.

In an era of rapid development, each field should not be viewed as dialectically superior against the other, rather both development communication and policy sciences should mutually work to advance for the social change. The thrusts and goals of Development communication can be sustainable if it is backed by certain policies.

Following Quebral’s definition of Development communication “the ''art'' and ''science'' of ''human communication'' applied to ''speedy transformation'' of a country and the mass of its people from ''poverty'' to ''dynamic state of economic growth'' that makes possible ''greater social equality'' and the ''larger fulfillment of human potential''”, Flor and Ongkiko explained each aspect of this definition for better understanding on why development communication was defined this way.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia C. Ongkiko, Ila &amp; Flor, Alexander. (2006). Introduction to Development Communication. 10.13140/RG.2.1.2952.6887. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''ART'''

In relaying a message, creativity is needed to attract the attention of its audience. It does not focus only on beautifying the message or the image but the art of communicating with people that would help them understand and adapt to the changes that will happen to them.

'''SCIENCE'''

As Flor and Ongkiko emphasize, development communication is a social science. At the same time, it is both theory and practices. The theory is backed-up with science in order to understand a situation, then the application or execution of plans towards development is the practice. A systematic approach which mostly based on the methods of science is followed in order to address a situation. The most commonly used method is identifying the problem, gathering data about the problem and develop communication processes that will be useful in able to address the situation and helped the community for development.

'''HUMAN COMMUNICATION'''

This is an important aspect for development communication because it is people-centred. The people need to communicate with one another for their own development. The people behind the development is reaching out to the people who need development. That is human communication.

'''SPEEDY TRANSFORMATION'''

This represents the social change that will happen to the community. All the researches made in able to identify the problem must put into action for the transformation of the lives of the people in the community.

'''POVERTY'''

The greatest challenge in development communication is poverty. Even in the Millennium Development Goals of United Nations, poverty is at the top of the list that needs to address with the hope of eradicating it in the future. Because of poverty, many people are experiencing malnutrition, unemployment and illiteracy which adds to the burden of the people.

'''DYNAMIC STATE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH, GREATER SOCIAL EQUALITY, LARGER FULFILLMENT OF HUMAN POTENTIAL'''

Since the goal is for development, this is a continuous process. The aim is to help the people with their economic, social, and environmental goals.

Noticeably, everything that was mentioned in the explanation of the definition of development communication has something to do with goals, progress, theory, research, problem identification, and practices. Thomas L. McPhail, also describes development communication as a process of change using education or media as long as it is for the purpose of positive social change.

This coincides with Harold Lasswell’s vision that policy sciences bring together social sciences and practical policymaking to solve public problems, formalizing the link between the two. &lt;ref&gt;Nick Turnbull. (2008). Harold Lasswell’s ‘problem orientation’ for the policy sciences. Critical Policy Studies Journal. volume 2, issue 1, 2008: 72-91 Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19460171.2008.9518532#.UjwQzfJ4GTN &lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned, development communication is backed with science through theories by identifying the problems needed to address. Lasswell identified policy science as problem-solving, with the idea of when addressing the problems, it should focus on human dignity or the fulfilment of human potential as Quebral said on her definition of development communication.

'''NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT'''

According to Jaime B. Ramirez (2011), members of the development media have considered economic and social development as one of the significant and vital signs of national development. Admittedly, he said, development communication cam always bridge gaps between the traditional and modern changing society, as it can raise the full aspirations of the people under the new society in the overall strategy for change.  Development communication accordingly, can enforce social norms. In terms of policy sciences, development communication Ramirez adds, can broaden the policy dialogue by providing the two-way flow of information and opinion required for development as a nation. It, therefore, plays a potent and major role to economic and social development as well as political power. Without sacrificing its freedom, the development media can contribute to the growth of democratic institutions and to political stability, essential to national development.&lt;Philippine Journalism Handbook, 3rd Edition. 2011 reprint&gt;.

==== Strategic communication for sustainable development ====

"Communication is a key factor to begin and keep a proper Sustainable Development strategy" (Bucur and Petra, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bucur, M &amp; Petra, C.|title=Why Is Communication So Special For Sustainable Development?|journal=Scientific Bulletin of the Petru Maior" University of Târgu Mureş|date=2011|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://scientificbulletin.upm.ro/papers/2011-1/Bucur-M.-Petra-C-Why-is-communication-so-special-for-sustainable-development.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development Communication can be defined as a "dialogue-based process entailing the strategic application of communication approaches, methods and/or technologies for social change". This definition highlights the three important features of development communication – process, analytical activity based on dialogue, and aims to achieve change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mefalopulos, P. and Grenna, L.|title=Promoting sustainable development through strategic communication|date=2004|publisher=IUCN, Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK|isbn=2-8317-0822-2|pages=25|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/57dd/349db9843a3876de72bd76b53116f93e8286.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Strategic Communication is essential in encouraging public participation and achieving effective policy making. It affects goal setting, decision making, development and implementation, and impact assessment. However, communication as a strategic tool remains deficient in development programs creating the need to establish an Interest Group on Strategic Communication for Sustainable Development. Strategic communication "aims at the innovative and sustainable change of practices, behaviors and lifestyles, guides communication processes and media interventions within and among social groups".
An effective strategy for sustainable development integrates the vision and action plan of the government, civil society and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Willner|first1=Susanne|title=Strategic Communication for Sustainable Development: A Conceptual Overview|url=https://www.cbd.int/cepa/toolkit/2008/doc/strategic%20communication%20for%20sustainable%20development.pdf|publisher=Schneller Druck, Reutlingen|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank views development communication as the "integration of strategic communication in development projects" based on a clear understanding of indigenous realities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manyozo|first1=Linje|title=Manifesto for Development Communication: Nora C. Quebral and the Los Baños School of Development Communication|journal=Asian Journal of Communication|date=March 2006|volume=16|issue=1|pages=79–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency is now recognizing the value of implementing strategic communication to support development initiatives. This is aligned with the long tradition of strategic communication initiatives used in development projects related to human rights, democracy, poverty alleviation and health aimed at generating awareness, promoting behavioral changes, affording mobilization, and creating partnerships to reach common goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sida Department for Policy and Methodology, Information Department|title=Dialogue and Strategic Communication in Development Cooperation|url=https://www.sida.se/contentassets/b4b1a8018a804e02848e716ca71cacb7/dialogue-and-strategic-communication-in-development-cooperation_1399.pdf|publisher=Edita Communication AB|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gender ====

Development communication efforts, along with other development strategies, have failed to improve the conditions of women on a global scale, and when compared with men, women are disproportionately subject to poverty, illiteracy, domestic violence, discrimination, and barriers to senior professional positions, even in development organizations (Harbour &amp; Twist, 1996). As a group that is marginalized from global, national, and community power structures, Wilkins (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkins|first=Karin|date=1999|title=Development discourse on gender and communication in strategies for social change|url=|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=49|pages=46–68|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; contends that women tend to constitute a target more often than a participant in the production of development communication. Moore (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Debating development discourse: Institutional and popular perspectives|author1=David B. Moore |author2=Gerald J. Schmitz|publisher=St. Martin’s Press.|year=1995|isbn=|location=New York|pages=1–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that “gender” made its “first discursive appearance” in development institutions during the 1960s (p.&amp;nbsp;43). However, it was not until 1975 that women’s contributions to the development process were formally acknowledged by the United Nations (UN). The mid-1970s marked a shift in attention to women in development, along with other critical transitions in the field of development communication (Rogers, 1976;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Everett|date=1976|title=Communication and development: The passing of the dominant paradigm|url=|journal=Communication Research|volume=3|pages=213–240|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schramm &amp; Lerner, 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communication and change: The last ten years—and the next|last=Wilbur Schramm|first=and Wilbur Schramm|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1976|isbn=|location=Honolulu|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A WID strategy advocated including women as an explicit focus in order to achieve development goals (Dagenais &amp; Piché, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women, feminism and development|last=Huguette Dagenais|first=and  Denise Piché|publisher=McGill-Queen’s University Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=Montreal, Canada|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, WID was placed on a global agenda when the UN sponsored a conference in Mexico City to launch the Year of Women. This facilitated the designation of the Decade for the Advancement of Women (1976 until 1985). As a discourse, WID served to organize principles for the production of knowledge about women by states, institutions, and communities (Escobar, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;210).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encountering development: The making and unmaking of the third world|last=Escobar|first=Arturo|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; WID construed women as actively contributing to society through their economic production and human reproduction (Staudt, 1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women, foreign assistance and advocacy administration|last=Staudt|first=Kathleen|publisher=Praeger|year=1985|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; WID also pointed to a need to improve women’s access to education, employment, and political participation (Valdivia, 1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valdivia|first=Angharad|date=1996|title=Is modern to male as traditional is to female?: Re-visioning gender construction in international communications|url=|journal=Journal of International Communication|volume=3|pages=5–25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; conditions considered in earlier models of modernization that tended to privilege male constituents. Throughout the Decade for the Advancement of Women however, several scholars recognized limits to using media to promote social change, such as problematic stereotypes of women in media texts, a lack of women’s employment in positions of power in media industries, and poor access to mediated technologies as a source of information, particularly among rural women.

Following the Decade for Women, attention to WID gradually shifted toward a concern with gender and development (GAD). This shift from “women” to “gender” resonates with an understanding of gender as a socially constructed category, rather than essentializing sex as a biological condition (Dagenais &amp; Piché, 1994). GAD attempted to position women as active agents of social change situated within social and structural systems of patriarchy and power (Dagenais &amp; Piché, 1994). Steeves (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steeves|first=Leslie|date=1993|title=Creating imagined communities: Development communication and the challenge of feminism|url=|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=43|pages=218–229|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; drew attention to critical scholarship about the political economy of communication and participatory approaches to development (Freire, 1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of the oppressed|last=Freire|first=Paulo|publisher=Continuum|year=1983|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to propose the creation of a global, imagined feminist community that challenges power relations. A “global feminist” approach to development would critique what appears to be defining gender according to reproductive capacity in a way that promotes motherhood as a universal role for women, rather than celebrating diversity in women’s intentions, experiences, backgrounds, and capabilities.

Hooda and Singh (2012) note that the most significant and longest social movement continuing is the movement for the emancipation of women. However, the primary goal for women empowerment is to improve the quality of life of women, but also has deep ramifications in social, economic and political scenario of body polity. It is such contentions that stressing the need to recognize power dimensions within women’s domestic, professional, and social contexts, GAD proponents would advocate interventions designed to change structures or norms.

Development communication activity embodies models of social change that are implemented across political and cultural boundaries wherein, issues of gender, communication, and development are grounded in global structures and processes of power, which condition access to and acquisition of economic and social resources. Watkins (1999) notes that in as much as critical scholars have described the global domination of media systems by Western and corporate agencies, gender also factors into this equation, as the extensive documentation of the tendency of media industries to trivialize women’s roles and concerns has been historically demonstrated (van Zoonen, 1994). Early scholars of development communication did not explicitly address the role of gender in their discussions of media and modernity (Watkins, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;48). However, an examination of their work illustrates implicit assumptions made about men’s and women’s roles in the development process.  There is thus a need to understand the dynamics contributing to the institutional construction of gender within development communication strategies designed to alleviate social problems. Watkins (1999) cites Steeves (1993) whose summary of feminist scholarship concluded that, among other areas, research is needed “on women’s roles and representations in Third World development communication activities, including funding agency projects” (p.&amp;nbsp;120). Along with integrating regional, national, and/or organizational perspectives, one specific tool for policymakers is ensuring that gender perspective is incorporated into policies. Regardless whether gender plays a central role in a development communication policy, the policy-making process has to be taken in a deliberate way to address concerns of both women and men. When views of different groups of women and men in policy formation and delivery are taken accordingly, misjudging of the different effects on each group, and the systems and organizations that support them can be avoided.&lt;ref name="Sutcliff&amp;Court"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sutcliffe|first1=Sophie|last2=Court|first2=Julius|title=A Toolkit for Progressive Policymakers in Developing Countries|date=2006|publisher=Overseas Development Institute|isbn=0 85003 786 7|url=http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/190.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a quest to ensure that the overall legal and policy framework is promoting gender equality, more than just adopting laws that explicitly provide for gender equality can be done. Thus it is essential that all laws and policies reflect gender equality considerations, through a process called [[gender mainstreaming]]. [[Gender mainstreaming]] is the mechanism to ensure a gender-sensitive approach to policy making.&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;{{cite book|last1=OECD, CAWTAR|title=Women in Public Life Gender, Law and Policy in the Middle East and North Africa|date=2014|publisher=OECD Publishing, Paris|isbn=9789264224636|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/women-in-public-life_9789264224636-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gender mainstreaming]], according to the [[United Nations]], is a globally accepted strategy for promoting gender equality. Mainstreaming is not an end in itself but a strategy, an approach, a means to achieve the goal of gender equality. Mainstreaming involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities—policy development, research, advocacy/ dialogue, legislation, resource allocation, and planning, implementation and monitoring of programmes and projects. A strong, continued commitment to gender mainstreaming is one of the most effective means for the [[United Nations]] to support promotion of gender equality at all levels—in research, legislation, policy development and in activities on the ground, and to ensure that women as well as men can influence, participate in and benefit from development efforts.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women|title=Gender Mainstreaming|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/gendermainstreaming.htm|website=www.un.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United Nations Children's Fund or [[UNICEF]] also promotes gender sensitivity in its policies. [[UNICEF]] gender review ensures that gender is mainstreamed in all [[UNICEF]]'s projects and programs as well as in its work with partners. [[UNICEF]] also ensures that the monitoring and evaluation tools are gender sensitive and that every staff is aware of the UN Code of conduct. UNICEF also uses the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGAD) as a tool to promote gender equality and women's empowerment in the development and implementation of projects.&lt;ref name=UNICEF&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNICEF Philippines|title=Gender Mainstreaming|url=http://www.unicef.org/philippines/aboutus_13424.html|website=www.unicef.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The communication approach embedded within empowerment models combines the use of appropriate media. This means using a variety of channels ranging from indigenous media, local and international media systems. (Einsiedel 1996).

==== Demography ====
Defined as the statistical study of populations, Demography is seen as more of a general science that can analyze populations that show change over a period of time. However, in combination with the more specific aspect of communication that has to do with social sciences, demographics can be a significant factor and consequently influencer of Development Communication policy design. Population changes are brought about by birth, migration and mortality. These demographic processes affect the use of resources, nation-building and society formation, and cultural development calling for development communication policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Demography?|url=https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/education_career/what_is_demography_1908/default.htm|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher for the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research Sebastian Klüsener "investigated how the exchange of ideas and information between people could affect the development of spatial, temporal, and social differences in demographic change. The results highlight that communication plays a much larger role in shaping demographic processes..."&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/news_press/news/news/the_role_of_communication_in_demographic_change_4105.htm|title=The role of communication in demographic change.|last=Klusener|first=Sebastian|date=|website=Max Planck Institute For Demographic Research|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her discussion of the relationship between communicators and their audiences, Natalie T. J. Tindall, an associate professor in the department of communication at Georgia State University, US, shares "Demographic categories can still tell us a lot about our social structure, and continue to be useful for macro-level understandings of people and societies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.communication-director.com/issues/different-perspective/going-beyond-demographics#.VyNjxEfNOng|title=Going beyond demographics|last=Tindall|first=Natalie T.J.|date=|website=Communication Director|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is with this understanding that policies can be designed more tailor-fit to those it is designed for.
Furthermore, the criterion by which a demography is performed are relevant factors that may act as a roadmap that can guide development communication policy making. This includes but is not limited to age, level of education, gender distribution profile, individual and household income, etc. With the anticipatory objective of policy sciences in relation to crisis or problem solving, the better policy makers get a grasp of how a population is demographically—not just socially—the more sensitive and pro-active policy making as a process can be. When perspectives of an accurate cross-sectional sampling of a population, group, or culture are taken into consideration, the ensuing policies are better geared towards the pre-set objectives. Scalone, Dribe, and Klusener have further found that "Communication can significantly increase the impact of population-relevant policies and other processes of social change..."&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; which reinforces the idea that as a science in itself, development communication policy design, becomes more accurate and purposeful when the correct information and variables are holistically integrated.

==== Selected approaches to communication planning for policy development ====
UNESCO or the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization is one of the multilateral organizations that uses communication planning for policy development.  In one of its publications back in 1980 "Approaches to Communication Planning," where it presents some of the most common approaches that scholars, planners and professionals to use.  Below are common approaches to communication planning.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UNESCO (1980).  Approaches to Communication Planning.  Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0004/000424/042484eo.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; on 28 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Process approach ====
The process approach deals directly with the communication planning process which deals to the theories within the planning process that asserts that planning is the application of theory on how and why they are used.  (UNESCO, 1980) The second is it deals with the planning process itself that provide alternative ways of organizing the planning function and process, given different purposes and planning contexts.  (UNESCO, 1980)  The thrust of the argument is that there are alternatives to the widely known rational/comprehensive planning approach (UNESCO, 1980).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Communication policy makers are not acting in isolation; they had the full support of scientist and theorists. Communication for Development aims at upholding change in people's attitudes and behavior so as to increase their participation in the development process.  Rogers' diffusion of innovations theory is perhaps the most influential theory in the modernization paradigm. The diffusion model gained wide currency in most developing nations and still looms large with the agenda to support 'development' by "informing the populations about the development projects, illustrating their advantages and recommending that they be supported"(Servaes, 1996). Communication within the modernization approach is synonymous to information and ignores the importance of feedback in the communication process. Melkote and Steeves (2001)&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Melkote, Srinivas R. and Steeves, H Leslie (2001). Communication for Development in the Third World: Theory and practice for empowerment, New Delhi, India: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; contributed three key qualities of modernization theory and practice: blaming the victim, Social Darwinism, and sustaining class structure of inequality. (1) Blaming the victim is an ideological process, an almost painless circumvention among policy-makers and intellectual all over the world. It is a process of justifying inequality in society by finding defects in the victims of inequality. The policymakers simply blame the despondent lives led by the poor in Third World countries and it is being attributed to the lack of motivation and access to information relating to the various social and economic aspects that they need in order to redeem themselves. (2) Social Darwinists believed that government interventions on behalf of the poor would have disastrous results since they would interfere with the laws of natural selection. The theorist believed that outside interventions to address matters concerning the poor would have dreadful results since these would be interfering with a natural course of events and individual choices and rights. (3) Sustaining class structure of inequality, this is a capitalist interest and quite difficult to overcome. The effect of a focus on individual level cultural deficiencies has been to sustain the status quo within and between unequal societies and thus delay change.

===== Systems approach =====

The systems approach in communication planning deals on how to establish new systems within organizations (UNESCO, 1980). This approach is valuable to planners faced with the task of setting up organizational systems to carry out communication functions (UNESCO, 1980). This approach can also be best applied to problems in the environment, providing planners with an analytical perspective on problem analysis and a range of techniques to use in implementing this perspective (UNESCO, 1980).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== Network approach =====

Network approach (Padovani &amp; Pavan, 2014) is a heuristic framework for theorizing and empirically investigating global communication governance (GCG) environments or networks in supranational settings characterized by plurality and multiplicity of agents, actors and stakeholders, plurality and diversity of cultures, complexity of interactions, plurality of political systems, and multiplicity of policy processes. GCG is a term coined by Padovani &amp; Pavan (2014) to "indicate the multiplicity of networks of interdependent but operationally autonomous actors that are involved with different degrees of autonomy and power, in processes of formal or informal character, through which they pursue different goals, produce relevant knowledge and cultural practices, and engage in political negotiation while trying to influence the outcome of decision-making in the domain of media and communication in transnational context" (p.&amp;nbsp;544). Network approach specifically focuses on the transnational dynamics that govern communication systems.&lt;ref&gt;(Source: Padovani, C. &amp; Pavan, E. (2014). Actors and Interactions in Global Communication Governance: The Heuristic Potential of Network Approach. In Mansell R. &amp; Raboy, M. (eds). The Handbook of Global Media and Communication Policy. John Wiley &amp; Sons.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Policy life cycle =====

Government officials and policy makers in both developed and developing countries are often confronted with problems for which they have no design solutions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Servaes, J., Jacobson, T. L., &amp; White, S. A. (1996). Participatory communication for social change. New Delhi: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Every problem, country and culture requires a specific approach and seems to go through policy life cycle. Winsemius proposed four phases of policy cycle;
Phase 1: Recognizing the problem; groups in the society such as government official, lobbyists and countries' leaders recognize the problem, e.g. terrorism, poverty, global warming, and other. The problem is made known to all stakeholders, during this stage the members realized that problem should be tackled through policy.
Phase 2: Gaining Control over the Problem; at this point, the government start to advance in their mechanisms through the formulation of policies. Policy oriented research is often appointed to scientific institutions, opinion surveys are piloted, and options for improving and solving the problem are accounted.
Phase 3: Solving the Problem; at this stage, policies, programs and projects are implemented. In most cases, the government will manage all the details of a program by itself but the best scenario is when NGOs and other involved groups participate in the initiatives.
Phase 4: Monitoring the Problem: At this point the focus is to ensure that the problem is under control and must remain so. This is also the time to think about future policies and to develop public and private partnerships in implementing policies.

==== Interdisciplinary research for policy and practice ====
Policy analysis has traditionally followed a linear model – problem identification, policy formulation, legislation, implementation, evaluation, and iteration. However, in solving complex socio-economic problems, a more interdisciplinary approach to societal problems may be more effective particularly for research topics of interdisciplinary nature (e.g., women's studies, environment) or those relevant to policy or strategic issues – drawing from different disciplines to enhance understanding of particular issues or for concept development. The main interest of interdisciplinary research for policy and practice is description, prediction, and ultimately social action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lyall|first1=Catherine|title=A Short Guide to Designing Interdisciplinary Research for Policy and Practice|url=http://www.genomicsnetwork.ac.uk/media/Short%20Guide%20to%20Designing%20Interdisciplinary%20Research%20for%20Policy%20and%20Practice.pdf|publisher=The Institute for the Study of Science Technology and Innovation (ISSTI)|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interdisciplinary research, different disciplines interact and work together at each and every stage of the research process – from conceptualisation, research design and methodology, data analysis and interpretation into policy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carr &amp; MacLachlan|title=INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH FOR DEVELOPMENT:|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Development_communication&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Methods in communication policy analysis ====
Ongkiko and Flor (2006)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; argue that a development communication specialist (DCS), at one time or another, also assumes the role of a communication policy analyst in Communication Policy Analysis 'because of his proactive posture and his preoccupation with purpose' (Flor, 1991). Remember that policy sciences anticipates, and looks forward, thus, substantiates the proactive nature of a DCS. In order to fully act out this role, there is a need for a rudimentary knowledge of methods in policy analysis, particularly those related to development communication.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Among these methods are discussed below:

===== Communication technology assessment (CTA) =====
Communication plays a vital role in project coordination, management, knowledge collection and transfer among different project shareholders (Malone &amp; Crowston, 1994; Espinosa &amp; Carmel, 2003, as cited by Gill, Bunker, &amp; Seltsikas, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1123&amp;context=pacis2012

| first =

}}&lt;/ref&gt;). CTA is a qualitative method that seeks to determine the higher and lower order impacts of specific forms of communication technology on the individual and society (Flor, 1991) prior to the adoption of new technology (Ongkiko &amp; Flor, 2006&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;). The decision to adopt or not depends on the findings of the assessment. CTA is forward-looking and adopts certain value premises on what is socially beneficial or detrimental to society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Being anticipatory in nature, CTA forecasts, at least on a probabilistic basis, the full spectrum of possible consequences of technological advance, leaving to the political process the actual choice among the alternative policies in the light of the best available knowledge of their likely consequences (Brooks, 1976, as cited by Ely, Zwanenberg, &amp; Stirling, 2010).&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Ely, Adrian, Zwanenberg, Patrick Van, &amp; Stirling, Andrew (2010). ''Technology Assessment: New Model of Technology Assessment for Development.''

===== Cost-Benefit Analysis =====
Introduced by Jules Dupuit in 1840s, French engineer and economist, the cost benefit analysis is a methodology used in policy analysis as a way of weighing up projects costs and benefits, to determine whether to go ahead with a project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_08.htm|title=Cost Benefit Analysis|last=|first=|date=|website=Mind Tools|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyea (1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/research-starters/cost-benefit-analysis-decision-making-public#research-starter-research-starter|title=Cost-Benefit Analysis: Decision Making Tools in Public Sector|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; identifies the types of cost analysis used in policy making to aid decision process. These are: Cost-Benefit analysis, Cost-effectiveness, cost-utilization and cost utility.

===== Social cost-benefit analysis =====

}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains that Social Cost Benefit Analysis (SCBA) is also referred to as Economic Analysis (EA). SCBA or EA is a feasibility study of a project from the viewpoint of a society to evaluate whether a proposed project will add benefit or cost to the society (Ibid.). Ongkiko and Flor (2006&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;) further elaborate that SCBA is a quantitative method which attaches monetary values on social conditions brought by certain communication policies. Flor (1991) explains the monetary value of the social costs is subtracted from the social benefits of a particular program or policy. A positive difference is required for a program or policy to be adjudged as socially beneficial.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The purpose of SCBA is to assist public decision-making, not in terms of producing the ideal project but simply by proposing the optimum solution for the community out of the spectrum of possibilities (Dupuis, 1985).&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Dupuis, Xavier (1985). ''Applications and Limitations of Cost-Benefit Analysis as Applied to Cultural Development.'' A study commissioned by UNESCO. Retrieved online from http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000819/081977eo.pdf [April 24, 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the objective is to determine optimum quantities as a contribution to decision-making or to evaluate the effectiveness of decisions already taken.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===== Problematique analysis =====
The problematique analysis procedure is a naturalistic approach&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web
| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233046805_Towards_a_methodology_for_problematique_analysis_A_philippine_experience

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that seeks to discover the influential factors&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and describe the structure of problems that exist in communication systems (Librero, 1993; Flor, 1991). The basic purpose of this approach, according to Librero (1993), is to identify the problem rather than the solution. In the process, therefore, the evaluator employing problematique analysis identifies the factors that influence the system, shows the hierarchical relationships of these factors and traces the root causes of the problems of the system.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Flor (1991) classified these influential factors as either ''subordinate'' or ''superordinate'', with the former being merely the symptoms of the latter. The identification of the superordinate influential factors or the root causes, then, prevents the recurrence of the problem situation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===== Scenario construction =====
As a policy analysis tool, scenario construction (SC) describes a possible set of future conditions (Moniz, 2006&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Moniz, Antonio Brandão (2006). ''Scenario-Building Methods as a Tool for Policy Analysis''. Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200002555_Scenario-Building_Methods_as_a_Tool_for_Policy_Analysis [accessed Apr 23, 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;) or hypothetical events that may occur in the future of a particular system (Allen, 1978, as cited by Flor, 1991). It has also been defined as a description of the conditions and events under which some system being studied is assumed to be operating (Kraemer, 1973, as cited by Flor, 1991). Scenarios provide an educated description of one of many possible futures of a system, usually presented at the most optimistic or "best-case" state and the most pessimistic or "worst-case" state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Moniz (2006), the most useful scenarios are those that display the conditions of important variables over time. In this approach, the quantitative underpinning enriches the narrative evolution of conditions or evolution of variables; narratives describe the important events and developments that shape the variables. In terms of innovative methods for policy analysis, the foresight and scenario construction methods can be an interesting reference for social sciences (Moniz, 2006&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;). Citing Allen (1978), Flor (1991) enumerates six steps in scenario construction, namely: (1) defining the system; (2) establishing a time period for the system to operate; (3) defining the external constraints on the environment of the system; (4) defining the elements or events within the system that are likely to increase or decrease the chances of the system's meeting its goals and objectives; (5) stating in probabilistic terms the likelihood of the occurrence of the elements or events; and (6) conducting a sensitive analysis of the results.

===== Policy Delphi =====
The Policy Delphi, according to Flor (1991), is a variation of the Delphi technique. It is a tool for the analysis of policy issues seeking the involvement and participation of anonymous respondents (usually representatives of the different stakeholders of the policy). Herein, the desirability and feasibility of certain policies are assessed from the points of view of the different stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Meanwhile, according to Turoff (1975), the policy Delphi aims to create the best possible contrasting insights to resolve a major policy problem. Herein, the decision maker is interested on having a group that will give him options and supporting evidences where he can choose from for him to make a solution, rather than having a group that will produce the decision for him. ''"The Policy Delphi is, then, a tool for the analysis of policy issues and not a mechanism for making a decision"'' (Turoff, 1975).&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Turoff, Murray (1975). The Policy Delphi. In ''Harold A. Linstone and Murray Turoff (Eds.), The Delphi Method: Techniques and Applications.'' pp. 80–96. Online copy was accessed from http://is.njit.edu/pubs/delphibook/delphibook.pdf [April 24, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Turoff (1975) notes the challenging nature of policy Delphi as a means for policy analysis, "both for the design team and for the respondents" (Turoff, 1975). As a process, the policy Delphi undergoes the following six phases: (1) Formulating the issue; (2) Citing options; (3) Deciding preliminary stance about the issue; (4) Searching and getting reasons for disputes; (5) Assessing the underlying reasons; (6) Reassessing the options.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

As a methodology, Delphi is used for structuring a group communication process so that the process is effective in allowing a group of individuals, as a whole, to deal with a complex problem.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; As mentioned, one of the advantages of this technique is the involvement of stakeholders in the analysis which is imperatively instrumental in building a consensus among people who will be/are affected by the policy/project. In the Philippines, this has also been well applied in a study conducted by Dr. Alexander Flor and Dr. Felix Librero in the Southeast Asian Needs Assessment for a Global Open Agriculture and Food University.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Recently, Haynes, Palermo and Reidlinger(2016) adopted a Delphi modified technique(James Lind Alliance Approach) in their study in exploring obesity prevention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haynes|first=Emily|last2=Palermo|first2=Claire|last3=Reidlinger|first3=Dianne P.|date=2016-09-01|title=Modified Policy-Delphi study for exploring obesity prevention priorities|url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/9/e011788|journal=BMJ Open|language=en|volume=6|issue=9|pages=e011788|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011788|issn=2044-6055|pmid=27601495|pmc=5020738}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia.

Flor (1991)&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; emphasizes the incorporation of divergent stakeholders in communication policy making. That the State is not a lone actor in the creation of public policies as noted by the various stakeholders identified by Flor (1991), attesting to the fact that State actions do not occur in an empty space. Consumer involvement to policy making can therefore of paramount importance in helping create relevant policies vis-à-vis Gatung’s (1979)&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johian. (1971). ‘A structural theory of imperialism’. ''Journal of Peace Research'', 8 (2) pp.81–117.&lt;/ref&gt; postulation of policies promoting "''horizontalization'' where exchanges occur between the centers and peripheries "on more equal terms"." In this regard, employing appropriate methods in policy research such would be necessary in ‘light of the diversity of stakeholders involved, there is a possibility to broaden the scope of ‘expertise’ to share opinion across diverse perspectives including local communities’ (Haynes, et al., 2016). Employing the Modified Policy-Delphi technique to crafting an all-inclusive communication policy include the following jusutification:
* The Policy-Delphi technique ability to explore consensus and dissent, rather than aiming to achieve consensus,
* As a flexible technique, it can be applied to various situations to map overlapping priorities from different perspectives and identify mutual priorities across stakeholder groups and therefore is a valuable exercise for investigating complex public issues
* The technique facilitates an in-depth investigation which may detect limitations, considerations and consequences of policy options which may enhance the value and success of policy implementation.
* The diversity of stakeholders involved makes reaching consensus on priorities less feasible but where mapping perspectives may identify mutual concepts behind the most agreeable options to inform future research and practice.
* The technique provides an opportunity for participants to contribute equally, and offers additional options and comments throughout; in this respect, it gives all participants, including consumers, a voice in the complex debate [equity in ‘Voices’]

The methodology outlined in Haynes et al (2016)&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, E., Palermo, C. and Reidlinger, D.P. (2016). ‘Modified Policy-Delphi study for exploring obesity prevention priorities’, ''BMJ Open'' 6:e011788. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011788&lt;/ref&gt; paper align with Servaes (1986)&lt;ref&gt;Servaes, Jan (1986). Participatory Communication (Research) from a Freirean Perspective. ''Africa Media Review'' 10 (1), pp. 73–91.&lt;/ref&gt; reference to the application of Participatory Communication (Research) from a Freirean Perspective by positing that for dialectical and emancipatory process of action and reflection that constitutes the "process of ''conscientization,'' where an agenda instead of defined by an academic elite and programs enacted by a bureaucratic elite for the benefit of an economic or political elite, participatory research involves people gaining an understanding of their situation, confidence and an ability to change that situation" (Servaes, 1986)&lt;ref&gt;Servaes, Jan (1986). Participatory Communication (Research) from a Freirean Perspective. ''Africa Media Review'' 10 (1), pp. 73–91.&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore the notion of Participatory Communication stresses the importance of cultural identity of local communities, and of democratisation and participation at all levels – international, national, local and individual. It points to a strategy, not merely inclusive of, but largely emanating from, the traditional 'receivers'. However one needs not to romanticize the use of such ‘equity’ methods. Sarveas(1986)&lt;ref&gt;Servaes, Jan (1986). Participatory Communication (Research) from a Freirean Perspective. ''Africa Media Review'' 10 (1), pp. 73–91.&lt;/ref&gt; had outlined the following caution:
* Participatory research can all too easily be utilized as yet another tool of manipulation by vested interests.
* While the approach strives towards empowerment, challenges existing structures, and is consequently ideological, rigidly prescribed ideologies must be avoided
* In addition, knowledge and perspective gained may well empower exploitative economic and authoritarian interests instead of local groups.
* Far from helping the process of liberation, if the researcher is not careful, he or she may only enable the traditional policy-makers and vested interests to present their goods in a more attractive package.
* Even the best intentioned researcher/activist can inadvertently enhance dependency rather than empowerment. If she/he enters communities with ready-made tools for analyzing reality, and solving problems, the result will likely be that as far as those tools are successful, dependency will simply be moved from one tyrant to another".

===== Simulations and modelling =====
Simulations and modelling recently become a useful tool policy analysis involving computers and software in creating a virtual representation of the scenario. Because it offers a systems view of the situation, the analyst or researcher can monitor how the players or variables interacts in the simulated environment. The purposes of simulations may vary to include education, research, design improvement and/or the exploration of the probable effect of different policy decisions.

Guyonne Kalbe(2004) identifies and distinguishes two types of simulation models: macro and micro levels. According to Kalbe, the macro-level is applied mostly for huge sectors of the industries. This macro simulation is usually applied by developed countries in order to assess and understand policy changes. On the other hand, the micro-level is used for a specific company using a sample of population when a need for more precised and focused information is its goal. In contrast to large-scale industries that use the macro-level approach, the micro-level is individualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalbe|first=Guyonne|date=|title=Introduction: The Use of Simulation Models in Policy Analysis|url=http://businesslaw.curtin.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/05/AJLE-v7n1-kalb-intro.pdf|journal=Australian Journal of Labour and Economics|volume=7|pages=1–12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since problems in policy decisions are not linear by nature, computer simulations provides a concrete view of the situation and how the variables changes pace. These changes in behaviors are integral in developing policies. Steven Bankes(1992) explicates the use of computer simulation in policy decisions wherein models used in policy analysis provide arguments to illuminate options for policy decisions based on the result of computer simulated analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Bankes, S. (1992). https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/notes/2009/N3093.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The methodology has been successfully used in development projects. Thorngate &amp; Tavakoli(2009) mention fields where computer simulations has aided decision makers in assessing the context and solutions to specific problems. Among these include: the climate changes, effects of fiscal changes in economic policies, traffic regulations, health allocation resources, air regulations and crisis management to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;Thorngate, W., and Tavakoli, M. (2009). Simulation, Rhetoric, and Policy Making. Simulation &amp; Gaming, Sage Publications. Volume 40 number 4. https://doi.org/10.1177/1046878108330539&lt;/ref&gt;

It is noted that simulations and modelling could be based on artificial data generating process (DGP) or real live data from the environment for analysis. The real data derived from the environment is often called “big data” due to the significantly larger size. This is especially critical in the development communication discussion when there is prevalent use of digital communication technology in low and middle income countries (Taylor &amp; Schroeder, 2015). The technologies in these countries include mobile phones and notebooks. These technologies emit data as a byproduct and have great potential to fill some of the problematic gaps encountered by country policy makers and international development organizations. There is research indicating that the use of big data represents an important complement to country level statistics (Taylor &amp; Schroeder, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor, L &amp; Schroeder R |first1=L&amp;R |title=Is bigger better? the emergence of big data as a tool for international development policy |journal=Geojournal |date=2015 |volume=80 |issue=4 |page=503-518 |doi=10.1007/s10708-014-9603-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;, better water quality modelling (Korfmacher, 1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Korfmacher |first1=K. S |title=Water quality modeling for environmental management: Lessons from the policy sciences |journal=Policy Sciences |date=1998 |volume=31 |issue=1 |page=35-54 |doi=10.1023/A:1004334600179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improved agricultural development (WESTERVELT, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=WESTERVELT |first1=J.D |title=Empowering stakeholders and policy makers with science-based simulation modeling tools |journal=The American Behavioral Scientist |date=2001 |volume=44 |issue=8 |page=1418-1437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of big data can ensure a more accurate measurement of macro-economic data such as price track. The Billion Prices Project (BPP) initiated by MIT’s Sloan School of Management challenges the Argentina government on the misleading inflation index report. It reported by very high inflation rate by the government’s statistical institute which led to the fire of all government officials in the department a few years later. The actual inflation rate after the lay-off eventually stabilizes. The group in MIT decided to investigate what is going on by programming a web scraper to find prices for everyday goods posted on the web by the country’s supermarkets. It scrapes many data on the web and is a financially affordable experiment. The outcome of the result led to an increased suspicion that Argentina’s statistical agency was under pressure to level off inflation rate by higher order authority. The BPP proves to be influential because it produced an inflation index that was more intuitively reflective of perceptions and in real society than the government. It also provides an alternative set of perspective on economic trends which policymakers can use to make prudent finance policy decisions. There is an increasing need for major governments in the world to rethink how development statistics should be collated in order to craft better and finer public policy.

The simulation approach in policy science is beneficial to policy coherence on the sustainable development goals commonly called SDGs. The SGDs developed by United Nations has integrative nature which is suitable for integrative modelling techniques (Collste et al., 2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collste, D., Pedercini, M., Cornell, S. E. |title=Policy coherence to achieve the SDGs: Using integrated simulation models to assess effective policies |journal=Sustainability Science, |date=2017 |volume=12 |issue=6 |page=921-931 |doi=10.1007/s11625-017-0457-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Collste and the researchers have shown in a Tanzania experiment that modelling approach towards SGDs can bring interlinks to the forefront and facilitate a shift to a discussion on development grounded in systems thinking. It brings the multitudes of possible feedback loops that shape a country’s development especially those in developing country. The modelling approach in SDGs maps interlinkages and provide analysis about the resulting behaviour of different policy decisions. It also provide new casual pathways on investments in public projects.

==== Applications of policy sciences to context-specific developmental policy issues ====

===== Environmental assessment =====
The [[policy science]]s are highly relevant in environmental impact assessments (EIA) and large-scale environmental change modeling. One example is the use of scenario-making in the study by Garb, Pulver, and VanDeveer (2008). Using storyline driven modeling, they sought to understand the impacts of human activities on natural systems. The said study departs from the increasingly technical approach to [[scenario analysis]]. Instead, they drew concept and methodologies from science and technology studies, sociology, and political science. Policy-making is multi-method, and in this case, multi-disciplinary. In this study's framework, scenario is said to be able to "co-produce knowledge and social order by facilitating collaboration between scientific and technical experts of various types and policy-makers and other non-scientists, as together they 'make sense' of aspects of the natural world and aspects of social interaction (their own and that of societies at large)." The intertwined relationship between development communication and policy sciences is affirmed because the study recommends including more representatives of social science professionals in global environmental scenario teams, and creating fora with their active involvement, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/3/4/045015/pdf|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/3/4/045015|title=Scenarios in society, society in scenarios: toward a social scientific analysis of storyline-driven environmental modeling |author= Yaakov Garb |displayauthors=etal|year=2008|journal=Environ. Res. Lett.|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, international-funding agencies such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank has recognised the potential of EIA as an opportunity for dialogue between and among project stakeholders (Flor, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/181519/Environmental_Communication |title=Environmental Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flor posits that though the EIA is generally regarded as a regularly and management tool, it should also be regarded as a communication process that seeks to achieve mutual understanding—the overall purpose of development communication and for that matter, environmental communication programs. This mutual understanding would translate to societal environmental consciousness.
Development communication as a discipline grew as a response to some of the most pressing problems of underdevelopment including environment and resources degradation. Environmental communication programs are logically subsumed under development communication.

Citing five case studies of the use of communication and social mobilisation in environmental protection and natural resources management programs, Flor laid out the following lessons learned from the five programs:

# Effective environment communication is not merely instructive nor consultative.
# Effective environmental communication is not merely informative either.
# Participation and collective action is internally driven, not externally imposed.
# Environmental communication should make use of indigenous media.
# Environment communication should be done on an interpersonal level as well as on a community level, and further on a national level.
# Participation takes time; effective communication proceeds at its own pace.
# Effective environment communication assumes a momentum of its own.

====Policy science as catalyst instrument for environmental communication towards development====

[[Policy science]] is the bedrock in developing environmental and social movement to address immense issue and predicament regarding environmental depletion and societal development. However, there are three components to be considered when addressing about the issue and talking about development (economy, environment, and society). The most prevalent phenomenon bound to become increasingly imperative through the on-going dual process of economic-cum-ecological globalization wherein the process of constructing policies for [[sustainable development]] is essential. The concept of "policy science" plays a central role in the development; therefore, the incorporation and synchronization of communication and policy science in tackling the challenges encountered is valuable. The communicators are critical contributors to societal development and environmental sustainability wherein the basis could be aided as the framework for [[policy analysis]] and policy construction. At these science-policy interfaces, policymakers, communicators and other key stakeholders are supposed to interact on a constant basis.&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=N.|title=The Science-Policy Interface as a Communication Process: Exploring How Policy Decision-Makers Perceive Science-Driven Policy and Make Evidence-Based Decisions on the Nuclear Fuel Cycle|journal=ProQuest LLC|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development with emphasis on [[environmental communication]] instrument guided by the policy science is a trending topic. Indeed, the consideration of environmental communication in developing policy to handle the enduring distresses act as catalyst for policy makers to unravel protuberant concern. Numerous countries that have developed or are developing when surfacing about the environment is essentially crucial as the development that is being misguided by the policy science will lead to a plethora of [[environmental crisis]]. Therefore, policy creation in fostering environmental communication is vital as it has significantly contributed to the totality growth of economy and serve as a platform to raise key questions that positively helpful in [[decision making]]. Environmental communication, defined as "... the medium that we use in constructing environmental problems and negotiating communities different responses to them.&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cox|first1=R.|title=Risk communication: Nonexpert publics and acceptable risk. In Environmental communication and the public sphere|date=2006|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=205-240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of environmental policy instruments at the national level has a positive influence on [[environmental management]] at other levels and all sectors.&lt;ref name="Lagzdina"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lagzdina|first1=E.|title=Environmental communication instruments for environmental policy integration|journal=Scientific Journal of Riga Technical University: Environmental and Climate Technologies|date=2010|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the requirement in developing "environmental communication instrument" is essential to lay the foundation for the framework to understand the environmental communication policy science in stimulating for development into top-down stream from national level. Communication in the environmental sector that is primarily formally regulated by access to information and participation legal acts, has great potential, if an immense variety of well-developed and continuously emerging new environmental communication forms represented by different sectors and target groups, are utilized for the common goal of sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Lagzdina" /&gt; However, these will become successful when communicators, policy makers, and key stakeholders can effectively convey their messages to each other and build mutual trust based on a set of co-constructed knowledge.&lt;ref name="Bogenschneider"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bogenschneider|first1=K.|last2=Corbett|first2=T.|title=Evidence-based policymaking: Insights from policy-minded researchers and research-minded policymakers|journal=Routledge|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Setting policy to promote environmental communication for development is essential. However, understanding environmental communication instruments especially the broad spectrum of technical content and social consideration to lever the consequences should not be deserted.

===== Governance =====
In a study by Hilbert, Miles, and Othmer (2009), a five-round Delphi exercise was conducted to show how "international foresight exercises, through online and offline tools, can make policy-making in developing countries more participatory, fostering transparency and accountability of public decision-making". Policy science was used to identify future priorities with regard to the 2005–2007 Latin American and Caribbean Action Plan for the Information Society ([[ELAC Action Plans|eLAC2007]]). The paper presented specific policy guidance, and explained how [[Delphi method|Policy]] [null Delphi] methods can be applied to make public decision-making more transparent and accountable, particularly in developing countries. Practical implications drawn include 1) "the governments' acknowledgement of the value of collective intelligence from civil society, academic and private sector participants of the Delphi and the ensuing appreciation of participative policy-making" and 2) "the role that can be played by the United Nations (and potentially by other inter-governmental agencies) in international participatory policy-making in the digital age, especially if they modernize the way they assist member countries in developing public policy agendas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbert|first=Martin|last2=Miles|first2=Ian|last3=Othmer|first3=Julia|date=2009-09-01|title=Foresight tools for participative policy-making in inter-governmental processes in developing countries: Lessons learned from the eLAC Policy Priorities Delphi|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162509000031|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=76|issue=7|pages=880–896|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2009.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Distance education =====
In the book "Beyond Access and Equity: Distance Learning Models in Asia", Flor (2002) details the case of SMP Terbuka, a junior secondary education in Indonesia delivered in distance learning mode. This is in consonance with the country's pursuit of the Universalization of Basic Education. In assessing the socio-cultural environment of SMP Terbuka and in determining the policy environment for [[distance learning]], environmental scanning was done. The study also used the problematique method to analyze structural-organizational problems in a distance learning system, along with their causes. Overall, a systems analysis approach was employed where the environment, the stakeholders, the organization cum network, and problem structure were analyzed. Flor proceeds with a proposed communication and advocacy plan for SMP Terbuka aimed at eliciting public support to this alternative education mode. In designing the [[social marketing]] and advocacy blueprint, situation analysis was used. This employed four methods, namely, "environmental scanning, communication resources assessment; review of existing communication strategies; and strategic impact analysis directed at sector stakeholders".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flor|first=Alexander G. |title=Beyond Access and Equity: Distance Learning Models in Asia |url=https://www.academia.edu/579451/Beyond_Access_and_Equity_Distance_Learning_Models_in_Asia |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Health reforms =====
Walt and Gilson (1994) emphasized the central role of policy analysis in health reforms in developing countries. In their study, they argue that [[health policy]] narrowly focuses on the content of reform, and neglects other crucial considerations such as the context that calls for such reform, the processes involved, and the social actors or the stakeholders associated with the reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WALT|first=GILL|last2=GILSON|first2=LUCY|date=1994-12-01|title=Reforming the health sector in developing countries: the central role of policy analysis|url=https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article-abstract/9/4/353/649125/Reforming-the-health-sector-in-developing?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Health Policy and Planning|language=en|volume=9|issue=4|pages=353–370|doi=10.1093/heapol/9.4.353|issn=0268-1080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Information overload and the wastage ratio ====
Fred Fedler (1989),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neill|first1=S.D.|title=Dilemmas in the Study of Information: Exploring the Boundaries of Information Science|date=1992|publisher=. Greenwood Publishing Group.}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned in the book, Dilemmas in the Study of Information: Exploring the Boundaries of Information Science, describes the impact of the Information age by referring to media's "vulnerability to hoaxes".  Fedler contends "journalists are vulnerable to information and will always be. Journalists cannot determine the truth to the stories they publish, nor check every details. They receive too many stories, and a single story may contain hundreds of details".  In the same vein, this is what majority of the specialists posits as the information explosion.

Now more than ever, information has exceeded in millions of gigabytes. Technology has brought people around the world to be confronted with so much information that utilization of this information has now become an issue.  Dr Paul Marsden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marsden|first1=Paul|title=Fast Facts: Information Overload 2013|url=http://digitalintelligencetoday.com/fast-facts-information-overload-2013/|website=Digital Intelligence Today|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Digital Intelligence Today defines information overload as "when the volume of potentially useful and relevant information available exceeds processing capacity and becomes a hindrance rather than a help" (Marsden, 2013).

Dr. Alexander Flor, in his article on the information wastage ratio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flor|first1=Alexander|title=Development Communication Praxis|date=2007|publisher=UP Open University}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that although information can be consumed anytime and seldom has expiration date;

"Research information is generated for a particular purpose, a specific user and a definite problem in mind. If such information is unavailable to the right person, at the right time and at the right place, then we conclude that the effort exerted to generate this amount of information has been wasted".

One approach that Flor has postulated to establish the underutilization is his information wastage ratio. The ratio takes into consideration the concepts of information generation (IG) and information utilization (IU) expressed as "wastage ratio that is equivalent to one minus the amount of information utilized divided by the quantity of information generated", thus:

Wr = 1 – IU/IG

Flor's formula accounts for the information deficit especially, among the Third World countries, where information utilization is constrained by factors such as  "low literacy, limited media access and availability, low computer literacy, low levels of education and unsound communication policy".
The framework that Flor presented is best described as "the communication revolution contributes to the quantity of information generated thus, information explosion happens". Since the relationship of the two phenomena is reciprocal, "the quantity of information, the quality of information and the information overload determine the information wastage in an information society".
The outcome of this wastage ratio provides support for the initiation of communication policies to ensure full utilization of information in varied fields.

====Between research, development and policy====

It is a complex task to achieve effectiveness in development policy especially in rural areas. It involves a range of stakeholders who need to demonstrate coordinated action. Sunitiyoso et al. (2012) claim that holistic thinking is needed to solve public policy problems which requires collaborative efforts across different organizational boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Sunitiyoso, Y., Wicaksono, A., Utomo, D. S., Putro, U. S., &amp; Mangkusubroto, K. (2012). Developing strategic initiatives through Triple Helix interactions: Systems modelling for policy development. Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 52, 140-149.&lt;/ref&gt; The government through its administration must show vigor and integrity to implement these programs. Development policy makers must consider providing education and sustained training in order to materialize the programs provided to the beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;Bhatnagar, S. (2000). Social implications of information and communication technology in developing countries: Lessons from Asian success stories. The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries, 1(1), 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustained training does not only rely to ICT, it also needs emotional quotient to motivate beneficiaries to get involved and develop a sense of ownership.  President Julius K. Nyerere once stated that the people must participate in considering, planning, and implementing their development (in Tanganyika African National Union, 1971 ).&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E. M. (1976). Communication and development: The passing of the dominant paradigm. Communication research, 3(2), 213-240.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore development can only be achieved when people develop themselves. This has been realized by not only socialist and communist nations, but also by capitalist nations such as Singapore and South Korea. Self- development is usually accompanied by social mobilization by political parties, non- government organizations and workers from the academe.

Scholars have proposed categories for the analysis of changes present in the research and policy sectors. What generates lack of accord between the effectiveness of development communication policy is the unrealized link between the importance of research and development to policy making.&lt;ref&gt;Leydesdorff, L. (2005). The Triple Helix Model and the Study of Knowledge-based Innovation Systems. Int. Journal of Contemporary Sociology 42 (1), 2005, 12-27.&lt;/ref&gt; As compared to Europe, the United States and Latin America, the challenges of knowledge and technology transfer have been solved in the forefront of attention in economic, social and industrial policy.&lt;ref&gt;Etzkowitz, H., &amp; Ranga, M. (2015). Triple Helix systems: an analytical framework for innovation policy and practice in the Knowledge Society. In Entrepreneurship and Knowledge Exchange (pp. 117-158). Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Gap between researchers and policy makers=====
The ''praxis'' or the marriage of research and practice, according to Flor (1991)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is needed to address the pressing social issues that are pestering the society. However, there are factors that delay its realization. According to UNCTAD Virtual Institute (2006), there are still a huge communication gap between researchers and policy makers. On the side of the policy makers, the information on ongoing researchers barely reaches to them. The researchers, on the other hand, lack the awareness and the knowledge on the most important policy that could contribute so much in the research. Here are some common reasons for the wide gap between the two:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
Policy makers turn primarily to international organizations, international research institutes or their own technical experts or diplomatic missions to obtain information and analysis as policy inputs. Local universities and research institutes may have the capacity but are often not able to engage in cooperation with policy makers.
Policy-makers consider the credibility of researchers and research outputs a key requirement for cooperation.
Governments lack systematic procedures regarding which research institutions to turn to, and when and how to establish contact with researchers.
Data required for informed research may be non-existent or inaccessible.
Hence, the joint UNCTAD-WTO-ITC workshop on trade policy analysis workshop has forwarded these recommendations for both the research institutions and policy making bodies:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;UNCTAD-WTO-ITC (2006). [http://vi.unctad.org/tda/papers/tradedata/tdarecs.PDF Research-based Policy Making: Bridging the Gap between Researchers and Policy Makers], Recommendations for researchers and policy makers arising from the joint UNCTAD-WTO-ITC workshop on trade policy analysis, Geneva, 11–15 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a researcher:
Try to disseminate information about current research projects as widely as possible:
Invite concerned government officials to conferences or presentations of research, or organize specific events bringing together policy makers and researchers
Send notes and abstracts to relevant ministries
Distribute research to government agencies but also to NGOs, which might also be among its users. Be ready to discuss work in progress with policy-makers after initial contacts have been established.
Try to get in direct contact, for example with negotiators, by providing them with short notes/abstracts of relevant research findings.
Establish contact and build a long-term cooperation with relevant ministries. The start can be facilitated by having a "champion" in the ministry. However, the researcher/research institution may need to avoid being too closely identified with a "champion", and hence, depending too much on the evolution of the "champion's" status.
Access to high-ranked officials at ministries can be facilitated by involving higher-level representatives at universities (deans, vice-chancellors…) in the establishment and maintenance of contacts. However, more decentralized cooperation can also be productive if he procedures within the university tend to be very hierarchical and bureaucratic.
As a policy maker:
Involve policy-makers in research. Policy-makers who are consulted at the initial stages of a research project tend to be more open since they can actively participate and hence have a stake in shaping the research questions, and thereby take "ownership" of the research as well. Regular interaction during the research project can help adjusting the questions researched and the tools used to the needs of policy makers.
Make sure that your research addresses issues of policy relevance to your country by approaching permanent missions in Geneva which can act as facilitators by providing information regarding current policy-relevant research questions.

=====Bridging the gap through collaboration=====

There has been shift of policy-making from academic sources of development relations between government, academia and industry, and scholars often refer this as “triple helix model”. Henry Etzkowitz defines it as a “a spiral model of innovation that captures multiple reciprocal relationships at different points in the process of knowledge capitalization.”&lt;ref&gt;Sunitiyoso, Y., Wicaksono, A., Utomo, D. S., Putro, U. S., &amp; Mangkusubroto, K. (2012). Developing strategic initiatives through Triple Helix interactions: Systems modelling for policy development. Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 52, 140-149.&lt;/ref&gt; Etzkowitz and Melo (2004) stated that recognizing that university is the source of new knowledge, industry is where the practice ground for technology and development and the supporting role of government as policy makers. The importance of collaboration is a successful model in any project management. More so when a holistic approach is applied in policy development, it may be a solution to address the complexity of policy implementation as all stakeholders are required to participate beginning from the conceptualization, planning, policy formulation and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Sunitiyoso, Y., Wicaksono, A., Utomo, D. S., Putro, U. S., &amp; Mangkusubroto, K. (2012). Developing strategic initiatives through Triple Helix interactions: Systems modelling for policy development. Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences, 52, 140-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Policy sciences ====
Nora Quebral (1971) defines development communication as "the art and science of human communication applied to the speedy transformation of a country and the mass of its people from poverty to a dynamic state of economic growth that makes possible greater social equality and larger fulfilment of the human potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://devcomconvergence.wordpress.com/tag/nora-c-quebral/|title=Nora C. Quebral – devcomconvergence|website=devcomconvergence.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental characteristic that distinguishes development communication from traditional views of mass communication is its purposive nature. According to Flor, policies, being guidelines, imply that certain directions are already assumed. Development communication and the policies sciences stem from the same rationale, which is the need for actively applying knowledge form and principles of the social sciences in order to solve large-scale societal problems under the premise of social change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Melafopulos (2008) presented two modes or approaches to development communication: the monologic mode and the dialogic mode. The monologic mode is linked to the standpoint of 'diffusion' following the one-way model of communication. The purpose of this mode is to disseminate information and messages to persuade its recipients about the intended change. In short, communication is positioned to (1) inform and (2) persuade. In this model, the feedback is enhanced and canned allowing the sender to refine its persuasive message. On the other hand, dialogic mode is related with the participatory paradigm which follows a two-way communication model. It seeks to create a conducive environment where stakeholders are involved in all stages of the project from the definitions down to the implementation of solutions. This model seeks to make use of communication (1) to assess and (2) to empower. The use of dialogic communication paves the way for building of trust and understanding which is the key to participation and eventually for the empowerment of the people in the grassroots.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Achieving development in the community is collaboration between different stakeholders. Development communication believes that in order to have genuine development, that desire to improve and uplift their lives must come from the grassroots level; it must come from the people. Development communication empowers the people to believe in themselves that they can do something in order to alleviate their standard of living. In their book, [http://booklikes.com/introduction-to-development-communication-ila-virginia-c-ongkiko-alexander-/book,6911885 Introduction to Development Communication], Ongkiko and Flor (2006) claimed that Development communication entails motivating individuals and groups of people such as farmers, fisherfolks, workers, housewives, and the youth to change their habits, their lifestyles, their way of thinking and their way of doing things. This further proves that development communication is not just merely providing facts and information instead its goal is to persuade the people to become an active participant in the achievement of their goals.

Policy sciences refer to the scientific study of policies and policy making. Policy refers to a cluster of decisions with a particular purpose and audience in mind. The word "science" is used to suggest the use of empirical data gathered from systematic observation. The plural form (sciences) is used to underscore the interdisciplinary nature of this field (Allen, 1978). Policy science was conceived in order to cope-up with the fast changing landscape of our society. Because of these changes they called, "turbulent field", the traditional social science methodology was already considered inadequate in solving today's societal problems (Allen, 1978). The goal of policy sciences is to develop and provide concrete solution to the rising problems brought by technological progress.&lt;ref name=":87"&gt;[http://www.policysciences.org/classics/preview.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy sciences are concerned with knowledge of and in the decision processes of the public and civic order. Knowledge of the decision process implies systematic, empirical studies of how policies are made and put into effect. When knowledge is systematic, it goes beyond the aphoristic remarks that are strewn through the "wisdom" literature of the past.&lt;ref name=":87"/&gt;

Development communication and policy sciences are two essential elements in resolving recurring dilemma especially in the third world societies.

==== In the Information Age ====
In Flor's ''Developing Societies in the Information Age: A Critical Perspective'', he mentioned the 2000 Okinawa Summit of G7/G8 nations that described information and communications technology or ICT as "one of the most potent forces in shaping the Twenty-first Century...fast becoming a vital engine of growth for the world economy". The summit also decried the existence of a digital divide between rich and poor nations and that the major challenge posed today is to bridge this widening chasm. The Information Age, the so-called third era of human civilization is a pervasive social phenomenon, a global environment. In the Information Age, capital becomes less important than information. In fact, information becomes the "primary resource". There is an observed global shift in resources of power from land, labor and capital to information. The change is more on the nature of resources that are being controlled.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Developing Societies in the Information Age: A Critical Perspective|last=Flor|first=Alexander|publisher=|year=July 2008|isbn=|location=Los Baños, Laguna|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Flor stated, "informatization comes with the Information Age. All aspects of society – politics, culture, business and economy – have become increasingly information-oriented. Information gives rise to economies and societies wherein information, naturally, becomes the dominant commodity or resource. Concomitant to informatization is the globalization of the economy. The communications or information revolution has tended to shrink the size of the world, figuratively. Instant communication between two persons situated at opposite sides of the globe is a common occurrence. Distance no longer serves as a minor factor in communication."

===== Information society vs. Information Age =====
An ''information society'' should be differentiated from ''Information Age''. An information society refers to a social system, meanwhile, the Information Age refers to an era in human civilization, a worldwide phenomenon. It is possible for people to live in an information age but not in an information society. Observations have also pointed that the trend towards information societies can be found in the Third World. For example, in Asia, certain trends that are indifferent to political developments show that Asia is moving towards that direction. These trends include: the growing demand for mobile devices and software, broadband, Wi-Fi, wi-max services, and even online educational programs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===== Control through communication =====
"Control is achieved through communication. Norbert Weiner, the father of cybernetics, equated communication with control and observed that it is negatively related to entropy, the tendency for all systems towards breakdown. This function or relationship is magnified in the Information Age." Therefore, in the Information Age, there seems to be a positive correlation between information and power, between communication and power. The logical consequence of this is the gravitation of special interest groups to the communication/information industry and the mad scramble for communication resources. Those who will gain access to more resources would understandably hold more political and economic power. They may, in turn, perpetuate this condition by determining enabling societal structures. According to Flor, information, traditionally defined, is that which contributes to the reduction of uncertainty. Although technically accurate, the definition neglects the social dimension of information. "It is the social function which adds value to information and which gives those who possess it advantage over those who do not. Thus, information should be regarded first and foremost as a resource. As in the case of other resources, there is a tendency for other exploitative groups to hoard information and to use it to further their interests. Information nowadays is associated with influence and power. It is now treated as a dominant commodity under the control and manipulation of the elite." He also noted that "Information resources should contribute more towards equality than exploitation, towards harmony than conflict, towards complementarities than dominance, towards integration than segregation, towards participation than elitism, towards indigenous development than dependency, and towards convergence than divergence."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The availability of information may be a function of the availability of mass media, new media and other channels of information. Availability of communication media is obviously a prerequisite for access. For communities wherein media are relatively unavailable, access to communication media is hampered to a considerable degree.

In contrast, development communication can also be key towards more democratic societies. Democracy has been a prevailing philosophy in many countries for the recent years. However, until today, how democratic institutions affect human well-being, particularly people’s health is still argued. Existing evidences are not robust or strong in providing critical insights into the significance of democratic institutions on achieving better life expectancies and reducing mortalities (Besley and Kudamatsu, 2006). Life expectancies have increased dramatically and mortalities have significant reduced over the years. Such progress has been mostly attributed to increasing income per capita (Li and Zhu, 2006), improved medical technologies and interventions (Papageorgiou et al., 2007) and strengthened global collaborations (Elobu et al., 2014, Chu et al., 2014), among others. Previous literature has also favoured more democratic governments in maximizing health systems performance; and thereafter, improving health outcomes. In this view, health outcomes are better achieved because governments are controlled by the majority, leaders are more accountable for the benefit of all rather than minor groups of society, and mechanisms for selecting competent leaders to implement policies are deemed stronger. Despite evidence on its significance, some have still argued that democracy can only be successful in effecting positive impacts only if proper conditions are met. For example, the 1983 Polish health system has moved from a communist model without general practitioners to where clinicians in polyclinics provided free healthcare. The former system was then perceived to be better because the latter created more opportunities for bribery; hence, increasing inequitable access to healthcare (Scully, 2007). Recently, most health systems have transitioned along a continuum of private or market health systems similar to the United States and a public or state health systems similar to the United Kingdom (Chernichovsky, 1995). Such transitions may also be highly attributable to transitions in political states.  In a market/private-based health system similar to the United States health system, medical care is provided by private physicians and by private and public hospitals and patients have free choice of physicians. In addition, most people receive health insurance coverage through their workplace and health insurance is provided by multiple third-party insurers (Chernichovsky, 1995). On the other hand, planned/public-based health systems such as in the United Kingdom expects that healthcare is a right (Chernichovsky, 1995). As such, health demands are provided directly through budgeting and management of providers.  Low and middle income countries (LMICs) are placed in between these continuum. In most LMICs, various health system reforms and transitions have already been done. Despite such transitions, they are still faced with poorer health outcomes and health statuses that are far beyond health targets. Hence, is it really democracy that matters or does it simply serve as proxy for societal and political progress? Some argued that proper conditions must first be met for such gains of democracy to be achieved. Development communication can serve as a tool to ensure the country's visions are aligned, a step towards creating such proper conditions.

===== Information and communication technologies for development =====
In the Information Age, technological growth is a crucial driving force behind economic progress, citizen engagement and job creation. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are shaping many aspects of the world's economies, governments and societies. Developing countries, too, recognize the importance of engaging various stakeholders to harness the transformative power of ICTs to provide more efficient services, catalyze economic development and strengthen social networks. When done properly and implemented effectively, ICT infrastructure investment and policy reform can empower poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

The World Bank Group's Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector strategy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/07/25/transform-innovate-connect-strategy-ict|title=Transform, Innovate, and Connect: A New Strategy for Information and Communication Technology|publisher=|date=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted in 2012, intends to help developing countries make use of the potential of ICTs to improve the delivery of public services; drive innovations and productivity gains; and improve competitiveness. Under the strategy, the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) focus on three priorities: (1) ''Transformation'', by making developments more open and accountable and improving service delivery; (2) ''Connectivity'', by scaling up affordable access to broadband including for women, disabled citizens, disadvantaged communities and people living in remote and rural areas; and (3) ''Innovation'', by developing competitive IT-based industries and fostering ICT innovation with a focus on job creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/ict/overview#1|title=Information &amp; Communication Technologies Overview|website=www.worldbank.org|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nascent technologies, such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence, are also set to reshape the development landscape. The United Nations, through its Virtual Reality Series Project, has tapped virtual reality to build platforms for advocacy, awareness, and fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxu2GOkj6qbRbTlVVnBXZXkwR1E/view|title=Virtual Reality Series|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its VR production titled [[Clouds over Sidra]] earned accolades for shedding light on the conditions of some 84,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan's Za'atari camp. HTC, developer of the Vive VR system, also supports the UN [[Sustainable Development Goals]] through its "VR for Impact" program, which seeks to "create a pathway to global peace and prosperity together".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vrforimpact.com/|title=VR for Impact|website=www.vrforimpact.com|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of policy implication, the immersive experience brought about by VR is expected "to elevate the voices of those who often do not have a say, bringing peoples' voices directly into the decision making process".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sdgactioncampaign.org/virtualreality/|title=Virtual Reality and Vulnerable Communities|website=www.sdgactioncampaign.org/|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Digital divide ====
The rapid transformation of technology has revolutionized the way we communicate. As a result, more and more people are getting "wired", which means connected to the Internet. The explosion of information creates an interconnected global village where everyone can easily connect and transact business in a flick of a second. This explosion of information however has widen the gap between the information rich and the information poor creating Digital Divide. IGI Global&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/digital-divide/7600|title=what is digital divide|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines digital divide as ''"the inequalities between groups in terms of access of knowledge of the use of ICT"''. Groups or communities that can afford technologies and has full access to the internet are the information rich while the underprivileged are the information poor.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

In his book ''Developing Societies in the Information Age'',Alexander Flor elucidated that digital divide emerges from an information dependent social environment. He further emphasized that "the divide is further aggravated by domineering system between the haves and the have-nots".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In a study conducted by Dr. Alexander Flor from 1983–1986 on the widening gap and its implications on the agricultural sector, he found out that "the information rich gets richer while the information poor gets poorer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Development Communication|last=Ongkiko|first=Ila Virginia C.|last2=Flor|first2=Alexander G.|publisher=SEAMEO SEARCA and the University of the Philippines Open University|year=1998|isbn=|location=Los Baños, Laguna, Philippines|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gender equality====

Although the discourse of development communication may recognize the importance of considering gender in the process of social change, organizational structures and norms may inhibit the successful implementation of projects. Despite the considerable attention directed toward women in health, nutrition, and population projects, women's conditions have not improved. This failure should not, however, be attributed as a direct consequence of development communication. Rather, the problematic conditions of women, along with the interventions designed to resolve them, need to be situated within a broader context of discourse and practice that privileges individual consumption and structural privatization in strategies for social change (Watkins, 1999, 63).

Hooda and Singh (2012) note that many feminist scholars recognize that everyday women's participation in the process of communication is essential. Involvement by the women to state their opinions in the institutions and systems that govern their lives is not only for recognition that participation is a basic human right, but also for a redistribution of political power in favor of disadvantaged groups. Involvement in decision-making is primarily about confronting the hegemonic structures of power—locally, nationally and globally (Sheth, 1997). It is a political action, a political struggle, a struggle that is not only among states, but also among people. Indeed, Wong (2012) shows why a discourse on gender matters in ICT for Development. Wong (2012) cites Resurreccion (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Resurreccion, B. (2011) ''The Gender and Climate Debate: More of the Same or New Pathways of Thinking and Doing?'', Asia Security Initiative Policy Series Working Paper no.10. Singapore: Nanyang Technological University.&lt;/ref&gt; who stresses that the access to, and the use of, ICTs is gender-shaped in that gender influences how the benefits, costs and risks of ICTs are distributed between, and within, women and men. As noted by Kothari (1985),&lt;ref&gt;Kothari, R. (1985). New social forces. Development: Seeds of Change, 1, 11–14. La touche, S. (1997). Paradoxical growth. In M. Rahnema &amp; V. Bawtree (Eds.), The Post-Development Reader (pp. 135–42). London: Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt; communications is not taken as informatics (alone), but as politics on issues of empowerment.

Information and communication, food security and nutrition, and gender equality are closely linked dimensions of rural development, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-Dimity Project, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dimitra Project|title=Dimitra Project: Communicating Gender for Rural Development, Integrating Gender in Communication for Development|url=http://www.fao.org/dimitra/home/en/|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vital contribution of women to the agricultural sphere in developing societies cannot be overemphasized. It's critical to give rural women access to the same resources and opportunities as men in order to be more productive. To achieve enhanced productivity and better performance, women have to be provided access to information, knowledge and decision-making. Hooda and Singh (2011) however opine that with regard to the impact of technologies on women, there has been a tendency on the part of governments and development agencies to treat technologies as neutral, value-free, without taking into account the social, environmental and economic effects of the technology being introduced. A common assumption with respect to technology is that the simple existence of technology itself will advance competence and will thus fetch empowerment and reimbursement to the women. Wong (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Sam (2012). ''Exploring the 'GenderICTClimate Change' Nexus in Development:'' From Digital Divide to Digital Empowerment. ''Centre for Development Informatics.'' Institute for Development Policy and Management, SED&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates that restricted access to assets, gender-biased institutional arrangements, and unfavourable social structures have reduced women's capability to draw on ICTs in tackling climate change.  According to Hooda and Singh (2011), focus on ICT competence and capability compromises concerns related to equity. In any case, social equity requires assurance to women's equal opportunity. Therefore, women's equality needs to be integrated as a cornerstone of any development and communication strategy. In addressing these limitations, Wong (2012) outlines four digital empowerment proposals that may make 'ICT climate change' interventions more gender-sensitive:

(1) '''''Contextualise gender mainstreaming''''': gender mainstreaming helps integrate gender analysis into ICT policies. It acknowledges that men and women perceive and receive information differently, and that this requires diverse approaches to adaptation. However, the attempt to reposition women and girls as 'ecocarers' is problematic because this fails to capture their protective, as well as their destructive, role in relation to natural resources. Without addressing the unequal power relations between women

and girls, e-adaptive practices can also help reproduce the intergenerational equalities.

(2) '''''Strengthen governance''''': crafting new and reforming old, institutional arrangements is essential to improve gender inclusion. Women only interventions are sometimes necessary to empower previously excluded women to engage in ICT related decisions. However, poor and powerless men should also have their say in climate change policies.

(3) '''''Develop gender-sensitive funding mechanisms''''': securing adequate funding to support ICT interventions is crucial to gender empowerment. Yet, targeting women by microcredit projects risk putting an additional financial burden on them, and that needs serious reconsideration.

(4) '''''Recognise agency-structure dynamics''''': women are active agents, but they are socially constrained from engaging in ICT related decisions. Women's preferences, institutional arrangements and politics need to be taken into account in order to tackle digital exclusion.

Wong (2012) believes that taking the outlined four proposals are useful for development agencies, governments and NGOs to improve the gendered outcomes from use of ICTs in response to an issue as climate change. Thus, communicating from a gender perspective is important for fighting poverty and for supporting the economic empowerment of women. Women who are frequently the most disadvantaged gender in society are central to development, yet they have very little voice in the process of development planning. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=USAID|title=Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment|url=https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/gender-equality-and-womens-empowerment|publisher=United States Agency for International Development|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports that ''"while women make up more than 40 percent of the agriculture labor force, only 3 to 20 percent are landholders. In Africa, women-owned enterprises make up as little as 10 percent of all businesses. In South Asia, that number is only 3 percent. And despite representing half the global population, women comprise less than 20 percent of the world's legislators."''

Advancing gender equality and women's empowerment is a vital key in utilizing human resources and capital on an enormous scale. According to the World Bank, ''"countries with greater gender equality are more prosperous and competitive".'' For communities to grow, gender equality policy and strategies have to be developed and implemented. Women must be provided access to information, technology, and education. They must have equal rights and equal opportunities as entrepreneurs, wage earners, and leaders of our society. Promoting gender equality is a profitable investment we can make to advance women development.

Since its early inception, development communication has been widely utilized by many regions of the world owing its strategic direction of alleviating the lives of the poor by extending knowledge and information to a number of projects and programs intended to create a sustainable life. Hence, development communication practice in various areas of the world yielded a number of policy integrations reflecting its core objectives for an inclusive development. True to its definition, development communication, according to S.T. Kwame Boafo, author of the article 'Utilizing Development Communication Strategies in African Societies: A Critical Perspective', "is the application of modem and traditional communication technologies to aid and enhance the process of socio-economic, political and cultural change. It is the planned, conscious and systematized use of communication strategies and processes to bridge informational and attitudinal gaps and to establish or sustain a climate that favors the process of change and development."&lt;ref name="Boafo1985"&gt; Boafo, S.T.K. (1985). Utilizing development communication in African Societies: A critical perspective [Development communication in Africa]. Retrieved May 8, 2018 from http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/001654928503500202
&lt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/001654928503500202&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, this definition itself does not lend the idea that change immediately follows. Hence, Boafo articulated further that the definition above "does not imply that communication or information per se can effect development or change without an integrated and consistently pursued national development policy."&lt;ref name="Boafo1985"/&gt; Therefore, it is vital that development communication should be an integral element in the formulation of national policies so as to utilize its full potential.&lt;ref name="Boafo1985"/&gt;

==== Catholic Church: sample communications policies ====
Christ commissioned the Apostles to preach the Good News to the whole world, a mission extended to all Christians today. Communication therefore is part of following Christ. Being committed to spread the Good News, the Catholic Church has always been at the forefront of communications – from oral preaching, catechesis, personal friendships, small or big groups gatherings (openly or in secret where Christians are persecuted, even in present times), manual copying in papyrus or parchments scrolls, artwork, architecture, oral traditions, printing, theaters, tri-media and online, etc.

For academic studies within the Catholic setting, Pontifical Universities in Rome offer Bachelor's, Licentiate and Doctoral courses on Church communications, lasting three to six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-11-08|title=Pontifical universities in Rome|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pontifical_universities_in_Rome&amp;oldid=809265705|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following guidelines, and communication as a whole, should, as Prof. Flor states, "be employed for the service of others” (Chapter 3, p. 7).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

This setup is replicated in various degrees in countries all over the world. Communications policies are left to the regional, national or parish levels, rather than having a unified policy for the Catholic Church in the whole world.

Many documents, in the form of reflections or guidelines, have been published on different topics related with communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/pccs/index.htm|title=Pontifical Council for Social Communications|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this website, one document dates back to 1936, an Encyclical Letter of Pope Pius XI, called "Vigilanti Cura", manifesting his thoughts on the “Motion Picture” as it affects the moral and religious life of Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_29061936_vigilanti-cura.html|title=Vigilanti Cura (June 29,&amp;nbsp;1936) {{!}} PIUS XI|last=Pope Pius XI|first=|date=|website=w2.vatican.va|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example of Catholic Church Communications Policies at the Regional Level:''' '''CELAM'''

The Consejo Episcopal LatinoAmericano (CELAM), is the umbrella organization of 22 Episcopal Conferences (groups of Latin American and Caribbean Catholic Bishops, usually by country).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.celam.org/|title=CELAM - Consejo Episcopal Latinoamericano|website=www.celam.org|language=es|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its office is based in Bogotá, Colombia, and has a Department of Communications and Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.celam.org/dep_comunicacion.php|title=CELAM - Consejo Episcopal Latinoamericano|website=www.celam.org|language=es|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While no Comunications Policy is posted on CELAM’s website (nor is any retrievable online), there is a link to a presentation of the Department’s four programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.celam.org/programas/COMUNICACION_Y_PRENSA.pdf|title=DEPARTAMENTO DE COMUNICACIÓN Y PRENSA|last=CELAM|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific objectives contained therein could be considered as general directives indicating what the different lower levels of Church organization should undertake (my own translation from Spanish follows):
Common Communication Efforts in Communion and Dialogue towards Fraternity
Formation and Expression in Communication for the Development of the Culture of Encounter and the Announcing the Good News
Communication for the Transformation of Reality Towards the Fullness of Life of our Peoples
Inter-institutional Communion and Dialogue (within the Church)

CELAM is situated at a very broad level, covering part of North America (Mexico), the whole of Central and South America, and the Caribbeans. It is quite typical for Church documents at a high level, to focus heavily on principles, objectives and generalized directives; meanwhile, the concrete communications policies would be left to the local levels.

'''Example of Catholic Church Communications Policies at the National Level: USCCB Social Media Guidelines'''

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) "is an assembly of the hierarchy of the United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands who jointly exercise certain pastoral functions on behalf of the Christian faithful of the United States.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/about/|title=USCCB|last=|first=|date=|website=www.usccb.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its Introduction states, “These guidelines are offered as a synthesis of best practices. They include material compiled from church entities, for-profit corporations, and non-profit organizations”, presented as an aide to come up with local or organizational communications policies when it comes to the social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/about/communications/social-media-guidelines.cfm|title=Social Media Guidelines|last=USCCB|first=|date=|website=www.usccb.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It begins with guiding principles, quoting from Pope Francis: “Communication is a means of expressing the missionary vocation of the entire Church; today the social networks are one way to experience this call to discover the beauty of faith, the beauty of encountering Christ. In the area of communications too, we need a Church capable of bringing warmth and of stirring hearts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/messages/communications/documents/papa-francesco_20140124_messaggio-comunicazioni-sociali.html|title=XLVIII World Communications Day, 2014 - Communications at the Service of an Authentic Culture of Encounter|last=Pope Francis|first=|date=|website=w2.vatican.va|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media is a powerful instrument, changing the way people communicate. Pope Benedict XVI says that the Church has to be involved in social media to advance its mission of spreading the Good News, at the same time encouraging respect and dialogue, true friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/messages/communications/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20090124_43rd-world-communications-day.html|title=43rd World Communications Day, 2009 - New Technologies, New Relationships.

The USCCB document tries to cover all the areas in social media, suggesting the following elements to be included when parishes or other Church organizations develop guidelines: define boundaries, include examples of codes of conduct, define instructions, recommendations on dealing with offenders, providing trusted sites, and reminding administrators of their broad audience. Guidelines are also provided for organizational and personal sites, and social networking with minors.

Being a parish that serves the churchgoers, St. Mary Magdalene Catholic Church tries to make clear the procedures that would make the communications processes as efficient as possible. The document is quite detailed, allowing the reader (whether a parish employee, or the public) to know exactly how to proceed in each scenario.

== International communication ==

[[International communication]], the intellectual field that deals with issues of [[mass communication]] at a global level, is sometimes also called development communication. This field includes the history of the [[telegraph]], [[submarine communication cables]], [[shortwave]] or [[international broadcasting]], [[satellite]] television, and global flows of [[mass media]]. Today it includes issues of the [[Internet]] in a global perspective and the use of new technologies such as [[mobile phones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thussu |first=Daya Kishan |authorlink=Daya Kishan Thussu |title=International Communication: Continuity and Change |publisher=Arnold |year=2000 |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk communication ==
{{Main|Risk communication}}

Risk communication originated in the United States where environmental clean-up efforts were implemented through legislation. The terms 'risk communications' and 'risk management' were first used by [[William Ruckelshaus]], the first administrator of the U.S. '[[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), which was established in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Walaski"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk communication includes management decision risks, implementation risks and risks related to existing environmental, health, political, or social circumstances. For instance, in the health sector, risk communication addresses pandemics, natural disasters, bioterrorism, resource contamination, etc.&lt;ref name="Kreps"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definitions of "risk" include:
"The identification and analysis, either qualitative or quantitative, of the likelihood of the occurrence of a hazardous event overexposure, and the severity of injury or illness that may be caused by it." —American National Standard for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems (ANSI/AIHA Z10 – 2005 ):{{sfnp|Walaski|2011|p=7}}
"...the probability that a substance or situation will produce harm under specified conditions. Risk is a combination of two factors: (1) the probability that an adverse event will occur and (2) the consequences of the adverse event."—The Framework for Environmental Health Risk Management (Presidential/Congressional Commission on Risk Assessment and Risk Management, 1997):{{sfnp|Walaski|2011|p=7}}
"...the probability (or likelihood) that a harmful consequence will occur as a result of an action."—The Safety Professionals Handbook (Fields 2008 ):{{sfnp|Walaski|2011|p=7}}

Risk management was described as:
The evaluations and decisions that go into coping with risks (Lundgren and McMakin, 2004){{sfnp|Walaski| 2011|p=8}}
Planning for a crisis, which should involve the removal of risks and allow an organization, a society, or a system adequate control&lt;ref name="Policy Sciences in Action"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.policysciences.org/institute.php|title = Policy Sciences in Action|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;(Fearn-Banks, 2007){{sfnp|Walaski| 2011|p=8}} and
Factors that combat crises with the objective of minimizing damage. (Combs, 1999){{sfnp|Walaski| 2011|p=8}}

Risk communications involves important information for managing risks, both from authorities to those at risk and vice versa.{{sfnp|Walaski|2011|p=9}}

Development communication benefits from risk communications when the latter clarifies the risks of development (or lack thereof).

==Policy analysis in an organizational communication==

Development in the community has been observed critically not only the stakeholders but also the public themselves. Being one the recipients of the community projects, the public has been eyeing the government on the implementation of the development projects they are implementing. Part of the analysis in the organization is by analyzing how the communication in an organization works. The two are related as discussed as follows:

===Communication and its roles in development===
In the Philippines, the Medium Term Development Plan for 2004–2010 of the National Economic Development Authority states, "the successful implementation of the plan rests on the support of all sectors of society—the legislature, the judiciary, the local government units, the media and all sectors of society"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NEDA|title=Medium Term Development Plan 2004–2010|url=http://library.pcw.gov.ph/node/735}}&lt;/ref&gt; (NEDA, 2004).

In the context of Carnoy and Samoff (1990), they believed that education has great importance as part of the means of achieving social transformation. They emphasized that "appropriate ideas, values, and worldviews will be developed so that from the process of scholarship there emerges a new person—not simply with skills, but also someone with an understanding of his or her own role in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carnoy|first1=Martin|last2=Samoff|first2=Jeff|title=Education and Social Transformation in the Third World|date=1990|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than analyzing how the process of the implementation will run through, it is also relative to note who will deliver the message pertaining to the development project. This is where the role of communication takes place. As mentioned by NEDA, media played an important role in the process of the delivery of development projects. With the wide range of power of media to influence and to transmit information, it has the capability to reach the public connecting to the government and vice versa.

Communication is pervasive in the process of development. Communication includes mass media, telecommunications, information and communication technologies (ICTs), organized interpersonal communication, and all resources used by a society to enable information to flow within it. It has for its aims to inform, educate, persuade, entertain, motivate people and induce behavior change that contributes toward national development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openuni-clsu.edu.ph/openfiles/modules/dc808/Unit%201.doc|title=Unit 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fraser and Restrepo-Estrada (2001):
"Communication succeeds when it is an integral part, from the very beginning, of a development programme, playing a full role during the identification of the problems and priorities, as well as during the detailed planning, implementation, and evaluation… communication needs clear objectives, identification of different audience groups... careful message design... and monitoring and feedback."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fraser|first1=Colin|last2=Restrepo-Estrada|first2=Sonia|title=Communicating for Development. Human Change for Survival|date=1998|publisher=Taurus Publishers|location=London-New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication and organizational theory===
As mentioned, delivery of development project can be achieved should proper communication will be used. In attaining such, an organization implementing the development project should consider the system to be used.
An organization is where a system is being implemented. Its structure varied depending on the goals of the company, the image it portrays, and the quality it aims to achieve. Being a member of an organization, one has to know how the organization works.

This aim in knowing the technical-know-how within the organization leads to the concept of 'Organization Theory'. Later it becomes a 'social science discipline' which refers to "a body of thinking and writing that describes, explains and influences what goes on in organization". This leads to making this discipline as basis for exploring 'management and leadership theory' that enables the scholars to understand how an 'organization theory' works in the application of a certain system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McAuley|first1=J.|last2=Duberley|first2=J.|last3=Johnson|first3=P.|title=Organization theory: Challenges and perspectives|date=2007|publisher=Pearson Education Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, organizational theory (OT), according to Barzilai (2016), is the "study of organizations for the benefit of identifying common themes for the purpose of solving problems, maximizing efficiency and productivity, and meeting the needs of stakeholders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barzilai|first1=K|title=Organizational theory|url=http://www.cwru.edu/med/epidbio/mphp439/Organizational_Theory.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, development communication interweaves with policy science and organizational theory for one reason: Development projects require an organization as deciding body in crafting policy leading to the attainment of the project and as implementor of the projects.

==Interface revisited and reinforced: development communication and policy sciences==

To affirm the interface, I reviewed the notions of development communication and policy sciences.  Development education, a related and a younger discipline is shortly discussed.  I also highlight the similarities of these fields.

Quebral (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quebral|first1=N.C.|title=Development communication primer|date=2012|publisher=Southbound|location=Penang}}&lt;/ref&gt; redefines development communication as "the science of human communication linked to the transition of communities from poverty in all its forms to a dynamic overall growth that fosters equity and the unfolding of individual potential" (p.&amp;nbsp;9).

Meanwhile, Guru (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guru|first1=M.C.P.B.|title=Applied development communication|date=2016|publisher=Dominant Publisher and Distributions Pte Ltd|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains that development communication "(1) provides a conceptual and practical framework in accelerating development in all spheres of life; (2) includes the integration of planned, organized, and specific communication package into planning, programming, and implementation; (3)facilitates the flow of development education among various stakeholders; and (4) empowers marginalized individuals, groups, and organizations" (p.&amp;nbsp;101).

I thought that development education is just a function or a subset of development communication just like information, motivation, persuasion, among others.  In fact, it is discipline in its own right that started in the 1990s. Bourn (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bourn|first1=D|title=The theory and practice of development communication: A pedagogy for global social justice|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes it as "an education approach that (1) responds to issues of development, human rights, justice, and world citizenship; (2) presents an international development and human rights perspective within education in various parts of the world; (3) promotes voices and viewpoints of those who are excluded from an equal share in the benefits of international human development; (4) connects and compares development issues and challenges all over the world; (5) provides opportunities for people to reflect on their international roles and responsibilities with regard to issues of equality and justice in human development; and (6) narrates a new story of human development" (p.&amp;nbsp;47).

On the other hand, policy sciences or policy studies basically refer to the policy cycle, which involves "policy making, policy implementation, policy evaluation, and policy feedback" (Flynn and Asquer, 2017, p.&amp;nbsp;40).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flynn|first1=N.|last2=Asquer|first2=A.|title=Public sector management|date=2017|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally, it is a function of governance and, therefore the domain of government officials.  However, with democracy as a form of government in many nations, it has also become the domain of the governed, hence, the term public policy.  Most available literature on policy studies quote the definition developed by Hence Thomas Dye as "whatever governments choose to do or not to do."

However, Chakrabarty and Chand (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chakrabarty|first1=B.|last2=Chand|first2=P.|title=Public policy: Concept, theory, and practice|date=2016|publisher=Sage Publications India Pte Ltd|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that "[t]here cannot be a universal definition of policy although one can endure a near universal definition by highlighting its technical character" (p.&amp;nbsp;3).  With these, they characterize Dye's definition as "functional in character" and contend that "governments are not at all free to choose because their choice is context-dependent and governed by the ideology they adhere to" (p.&amp;nbsp;4).

They raise the limitations Dye's definition: (1) does not reflect or represent the ideological goals of the government; (2) does not reflect the critical role of institutions; and (3) does not provide enough inputs to conceptualize public policy as an executive device and as a marker of ideology.

After presenting the etymology of "public" and "policy", they propose a layman's definition through an acronym: POLICY.  PO stands for periodically organized, which suggests that policies are "constantly reinvented and transformed in accordance with changing social, economic, and political realities".  To add, LI means legally induced, which suggests it cannot dispense "constitutions and other legal instruments in shaping policy."  Lastly, CY means calculated yields, which implies that policies must be beneficial and profitable (p.&amp;nbsp;6).

With this, they propose a definition, that is, "[p]olicy being a functional design seeking to fulfill certain objectives on the basis of specific calculations of the pros and the cons, and this is naturally context-dependent" (p.&amp;nbsp;7).  Hence, it has a dynamic character: (1) it considers the changing environment, and (2) it prioritizes public good.

They also enumerate the features of a policy: (1) intentional or deliberately designed to address societal issues; (2) a course of action with specific goals and objectives; (3) devised in response to a perceived need or demand or problem; (4)creates an environment in which various actors converge to develop policy designs; (5) an authoritative decision by the government (Chakbarty and Chand, 2016, p.&amp;nbsp;8).

Three broad and dynamic disciplines are presented.  It is then instructive to highlight their commonalities or similarities to affirm their interface: (1) systematic (planned, organized, designed, or an approach); (2) change-oriented, preferably for the better if not the best (public good); (3) holistic and multidimensional; (4) pro-people or advocates of equity or social justice, and (5) largely participatory.

Development education, being the youngest field or discipline, has two distinct emphases: sustainable development and global citizenship (Bourn, 2015).  A number of modifiers have come before the term development over time, but the most recent is sustainable, hence, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Guru (2016) defines it as "a vision of the future that provides necessary blueprint through which the developmental activities of individuals and institutions can be streamlined on the basis of ethical, humanitarian, and professional considerations" (p.&amp;nbsp;85).  It has three dimensions: social, economic, and environmental (World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002 in Guru, 2016).  In fact, it is imperative for both development practitioners and policy makers to understand these dimensions.

== Culture ==
In the context of globalization, the need for communication is increasing. Many countries has invested in developing their technology which in turns speed up the exchange of information across different countries. This has led to a more complex work context in different institutions especially in business, education, and non-profit organizations. Employees not only has to deal with a lot of things that are not present in a very homogenous environment like observing other religious holidays, communicating in different languages, and also understanding different preferences on certain things. In a multi-cultural environment, organizational culture becomes more complex.

There were countless of research that show how poor communication can lead to poor organizational performance.&lt;ref&gt;Lowell C. Matthews and Bharat Thakkar (2012). The Impact of Globalization on Cross-Cultural Communication, Globalization – Education and Management Agendas, Dr. Hector Cuadra-Montiel (Ed.), InTech, DOI: 10.5772/45816. Available from: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.intechopen.com/books/globalization-education-and-management-agendas/the-impact-of-globalization-on-cross-cultural-communication&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is important for every organisation to develop an effective means to communicate internally and externally in the organization and find ways to develop a health knowledge sharing culture. Understanding the impact of globalisation is crucial for any organisation to be competitive in the global market. In this context, effective communication is expected to create a healthy organizational culture by providing necessary information that will bridge many gaps in the organization.

Flor (2007) noted that "communication and culture are inextricably linked" (p.&amp;nbsp;112). Seemingly, communication constitutes culture and vice versa in any organizational engagement internally and externally. From time immemorial, effective internal organizational communication which reduces uncertainties and increases productivity in the workplace has been the common goal of many organizations worldwide. Consequently, effective communication processes could mean effective communication policies are in place explicitly or have been legitimized in practice. Making this complicated is perceived in how decision-makers, policy experts and organizational members interact in furthering organizational communication processes. Flor (2007) describes potential complexities at work that could burden more than could help the organization's communication culture.&lt;blockquote&gt;The really difficult part of communication work (and perhaps the most time consuming) is pleasing everybody from your superior, to the subject matter specialist and, finally, to the user whose opinions (and tastes) may altogether vary from those of the decision-maker. This potentially is the most time consuming particularly since, right or wrong, everyone believes that he is a communication expert (p.167-168).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Participatory approach, community radio and policy development ===

The roots of participatory approaches in development communication according to Yoon (1996) can be found in the early years of the 1970s when many people in the development community began to question the top-down approach of development dominant in the 1950s and 60s which targeted the economic growth of countries as its main goal. Development according to Yoon (1996) was "thought to be triggered by the wide-scale diffusion and adoption of modern technologies". Such modernization Yoon (1996) further expounds, was planned in the national capitals under the guidance and direction of experts brought-in from developed countries. Often, the people in the villages who are the "objects" of these plans were the last to know when "strangers from the city turned-up, frequently unannounced, to survey land or look at project sites".&lt;ref&gt;Yoon, C. (1996). "Participatory communication for development". http://www.southbound.com.my/communication/parcom.htm Retrieved March 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; However, the demarcation of the First, Second and Third Worlds by late 1960s to early 1980s has broken down and the cross-over centre-periphery can be found in every region, a need for a new concept of development which emphasizes cultural identity and multidimensionality is raised (Servaes and Malikhao, 2005). Servaes and Malikhao (2005) posit that the'global' world, in general as well as in its distinct regional and national entities, is confronted with multifaceted crises.&lt;ref&gt;Servaes,  J. and Malikhao, P. (2005).  "Participatory communication: the new paradigm?" 91–103 http://bibliotecavirtual.clacso.org.ar/ar/libros/edicion/media/09Chapter5.pdf Retrieved April 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the obvious economic and financial crisis, they elaborate that one could also refer to social, ideological, moral, political, ethnic, ecological and security crises thus the previously held dependency perspective has become more difficult to support because of the growing interdependency of regions, nations and communities in the globalized world. A new viewpoint on development and social change has come to the forefront according to them which "the common starting point is the examination of the changes from 'bottom-up', from the self-development of the local community".

At first, speech, traditional and folk media, and group activities were considered the most appropriate instruments for supporting participatory communication hence, the practitioners in the mass media responded by innovating their own approach towards participatory communication (Yoon, 1996) which brought the emergence of community radios. The historical philosophy of community radio is to use this medium as the voice of the voiceless, the mouthpiece of the oppressed people and generally as a tool for development.&lt;ref&gt;AMARC. (1991). Proceedings of the seminar:Participatory communication community radio development, Montreal April 11 and 12, 1991, AMARC Montreal Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Yoon (1996) articulates that in community radios, the people "produced and voiced the programs which were focused on local issues which were the most current and important making way for participatory communication to be practiced at both the community or village level and at the broader regional or sub-regional level". Most of the successes of community broadcasting are to be found in the non-formal education sector (Beltran,1993 in Yoon, 1996). Literacy programs have been effectively conducted via community radio and television stations. Other subjects covered by these stations include gender issues, farming, health, income-generation, workers' safety and occupational health, land tenure, and religious matters (Yoon, 1996).

Mhagama (2015) posits that participatory development projects such as community radio employ a participatory approach to decision making processes and enable marginalized people to "define their own development path through the identification and implementation of projects that are initiated by them". He stresses that "participatory communication gives the local community a right to freely share or exchange information and to reach a consensus on what they want to do or to be done and how to do it". Tamminga (1997) in Mhagama (2015) addresses that in community radio the dichotomy between the rich and the marginalized sectors like women, indigenous peoples and the poor is broken by "allowing listeners an opportunity to shape the medium to meet their own specific needs and breakdown the monopolies of knowledge and power that marginalize them politically, economically and socially". In one project of UNESCO in partnership with the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), and the Philippine government a participatory communication project using community radio dubbed as ''"Tambuli"'' ('''Tambuli''' is a Filipino term referring to a traditional way of calling villagers to an important meeting)(Jayaweera and Tabing, 1997) was launched in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Jayaweera, W. and Tabing, L. (1997). "Villages find their voice: Radio brings empowerment to rural communities in the Philippines". ''UNESCO Courier'', 34–35. https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-19278043/villages-find-their-voice-radio-brings-empowerment&lt;/ref&gt; According to Howley (2005) the project was able to make the community residents come to appreciate radio's potential as a forum to discuss issues of mutual concern allowing the local populations to give immediate and sustained feedback to local, regional and even national political leaders and authorities which afforded them greater opportunity to chart their own destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Howley, K. (2005). "Wireless world: Global perspectives on community radio". ''Transformational Journal''. Issue No.10. http://www.transformationsjournal.org/issues/10/article_01.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Howley (2010) as cited in Mhagama (2015) stressed that "community radio highlights people's ability to alter and rearrange existing media structures to better suit their needs".&lt;ref&gt;Mhagama, Peter Matthews. (2015). Community radio as a tool for development: A case study of community radio stations in Malawi. (Ph.D). University of Leicester. https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/32447/1/Thesis.pdf Retrieved March 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; This is made possible Servaes (1996) in Mhagama (2015) concludes because community radio allows non-professionals to participate in media production, management, and planning of the communication systems.

== Development communication and the policy sciences work together towards social change ==
Flor (n. d., as cited in Academia, 2015) states that policy sciences and development communication have seemingly identical underlying function in society: to solve societal issues and make social change possible for the benefit of the greater majority. Development communication and policy sciences share key characteristics. First, both policy sciences and development communication are purposive. They serve specific and systematic functions to achieve a common goal which is to solve issues and problems in society in order to achieve change. Second, both policy sciences and development communication believe that, at times, power and corrupt practices in the government have the potential to undermine reasoned logic. This is evident in the commercialisation of mass media that advances profit over social responsibility. Thus, development communication and policy sciences have the role to combat such corrupt practices. The third characteristic that policy sciences and development communication share is to heed action for policies to take effect. Policies that remain in print/word without action is a futile enterprise. A policy to be effective needs to be implemented, monitored, assessed and sustained. For development communication and policy sciences to make great impact to the world, participation or engagement of stakeholders is necessary. Below is an analysis of a few studies that deal with how development communication relates with policy sciences, and how they fuse in order to effect change in the larger society. In a discussion on the policy sciences, Allen (1978, as cited in Flor, n. d.) states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Since communication permeates every facet of a person's behaviour, the study of communication is no less than one way to study policy making. Communication is a useful concept precisely because it is one more handle whereby we can effectively study policy making. Communication is one of those few variables through which any policy decision is dependent (p.69).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another example where development communication takes an important role is in the global health space. International organizations such as the World Health Organization, the Gavi Vaccine Alliance, ASEAN, and the United Nations have all used the principles of development communication to achieve global impacts. Specifically, on 08 August 1967, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which was then composed of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand was established with the signing of the ASEAN Declaration (Bangkok Declaration). In the succeeding years, other Southeast Asian countries have joined, including Brunei (1984), Viet Nam (1995), Lao PDR (1997), Myanmar (1997), and Cambodia (1999) (ASEAN 2012a: 1). It was established to accelerate the economic growth, social progress, and cultural development in the region; promote regional peace and stability; promote active collaboration and mutual assistance on matters of common interest; provide assistance to each other in the form of training and research facilities; and collaborate more effectively for the greater utilization of their agriculture and industries; among others (ASEAN 2012a: 1). Criticisms on the ASEAN have, however, noted various failures in the regionalism efforts in Southeast Asia. Previous studies have defined regionalism as “more than an institutional process of multilateral policy coordination and the negotiation of competing stakeholder interests... [It is a] collective and intersubjective identities” (Elliott 2003: 29-52). Recent regionalism efforts worldwide also worked either institutionally or through cooperation among governments (Anonymous2005: 2291-2313). Although some argues that the ASEAN’s regionalism efforts were seen as more of cooperation among the governments rather than an institutional one, development communication can play a key role in bridging these countries and towards commitment to the Declaration.

== Risk and disaster communication amongst the youths ==
The youths hold a pivotal role in making a difference in society. Being digital natives, they communicate efficiently, develop networks pervasively, and create, influence and change social norms and practices. In short, being communication natives who can create a collective voice, they have the power to influence policies and change perspectives deeply rooted in society. For instance, during disasters, the youths are viewed as passive victims with no role in communicating risks or preventing and responding to disasters. Since disaster management seems to be predominated by top-down strategies, not bottom-up, the youths are seen as weaklings who are at the receiving end of calamity relief operations. However, Mitchell, Haynes, Hall, Wei and Oven (2008) seem to have refuted this perception based on the findings of their case studies in El Salvador and New Orleans. Mitchell et al. (2008) concluded that children and youths can be potential informants within informal and formal risk communication networks. Their case studies have shown that:&lt;blockquote&gt;children and youth can become effective conduits, vehicles and bridges as they are embedded within the household and community and can act as trusted two-way "translators" and communicators. Overall, children and youth were found to be effective communicators of risk when language barriers exist increasing the agency of young people, an outside agent has helped support the organization of youth groups, the community has strong social cohesion, and there is a level of distrust in political sources (such as police impunity) (p. 269).&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the Philippines, a study by Fernandez and Shaw (2013) found that even until today, "young people are not given an active role in (or worse, are excluded from) the action toward disaster risk reduction" (p.&amp;nbsp;135). Fernandez and Shaw's (2013) review of national policies of the Philippines related to youth council participation in disaster risk reduction (DRR) shows discrepancies between ideal scenarios and actual youth participation in DRR in practice. So much more needs to be done in engaging young people in helping build disaster resilient communities. However, although these discrepancies exist, there are many success stories of Filipino youths involved in development programs with the aim to prepare communities for disasters. The National Youth Commission (NYC, 2013) believed that children and youth are not just a vulnerable group, but can play vital roles in their communities to prepare for future disasters. For instance, the Tanay Mountaineers Youth Arm, a Ten Accomplished Youth Organization (TAYO) 2013 winner, has been responding to victims of disasters not only in Tanay, Rizal but even in Quezon Province since Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) hit their town in 2009 (Rappler.com, 2014). The local government of Tanay has tapped the Tanay Mountaineers as the official disaster response team of the municipality. Another TAYO 2013 winner, the Hayag Youth Organization, carried out the "Langoy para sa Kaluwasan," a Swim Camp Disaster Preparedness and Open Water Safety Training for children and youth from impoverished communities in Ormoc City, Leyte. This is in response to the fact that many youths in Ormoc still do not know how to swim apart from the fact that water safety skills are not taught to them in school (Rappler.com, 2014). Despite scepticism, there still exists a growing optimism that policy scientists and communication policy developers can help review and reaffirm existing youth policies in the Philippines in engaging youth groups themselves for DRR projects, among others. Fernandez and Shaw (2013) posited that open and engaging communication is necessary so that the youths become more involved in disaster management and risk reduction efforts in their communities.

== Urban farming in cities and countries ==
Globalisation has been shaping this world into a small village. With this phenomenon comes urbanisation or massive urban planning that governments and private industries are advancing. With policies being created and governance being mandated, remote heartlands of countries are now slowly being transformed into urbanised places and spaces which in turn produce setbacks such as pollution, health issues and other social problems. However, one trend that is becoming popular in some countries is urban forestry which somehow demands for sound scientific information and public participation. According to Janse and Konijnendijk (2007), urban society's manifold perceptions, preferences and demands for urban forest goods and services indicate the necessity for socially inclusive policy planning processes. They said that successful policies can only be formulated by establishing close links with, for example, urban planning and municipal policies. Inherently, this means that close ties between research and policy are required. They discussed the outcomes of the NeighbourWoods research and development project in which a wide range of tools for public participation were tested in six urban woodland case-studies across Europe. Findings confirmed that a set of tools comprising a step-wise process from informing the public in an attractive way, collecting information on public opinion, towards fully participatory approaches such as direct involvement in decision-making is most likely to ensure socially inclusive planning. Communication with policy-makers requires a high degree of openness, clearly explaining every phase of the process, being open about each other's expectations, and developing relationships based on mutual trust (Janse &amp; Konijnendijk, 2007).

Despite power issues that lurk in most organisations and governments, Development Communication and policy sciences seem to advance specific and systematic functions to achieve a common goal for the benefit of the majority. This is shown in an increasingly global India, whereby an agricultural community in Pune, Maharashtra was faced with losing farmland to urbanisation and devised an unusual solution (Sami, 2013). Pooling their land together, the farmers in this community leveraged their social and political networks to take advantage of the changing economic climate in Pune and built a mixed-use township on their 400 acres of farmland (Sami, 2013). They formed alliances with other stakeholders, both internally within the agricultural community and externally at the city and state levels. Sami (2013) concluded that "ad-hoc coalitions in the power and politics of urban processes in an Indian city have emerged as a result of a political will and leadership vacuum in Indian cities in the face of the changing focus and priorities of national and regional governments as well as a growing gap in urban service provision" (p.&amp;nbsp;151).

== Communication for development (C4D) and e-Agriculture ==
If highly urbanised and wealthy cities or countries are advancing urban agriculture, it cannot be denied that many of the Third World countries are also at par when it comes to improving agricultural processes and policies and in the informatisation of agriculture. In Malawi, one of the poorest regions in Africa, Agunga (2012) emphasised that the success rate of poverty-reduction programming could be greater if C4D education was provided for development decision-makers and field staff, especially agricultural extension workers. Agunga (2012) further stated that agricultural extension education can impact development by focusing on how C4D can strengthen agricultural extension performance. He implied that educating policymakers about C4D will increase donor investments in pilot C4D projects, a strengthening of agricultural extension systems, and success of poverty-reduction programs (Agunga, 2012).

In the Philippines, a book by Flor (2007) entitled Development Communication Praxis discussed a rice scandal such that in the last quarter of 1990, the Philippines groaned as the price of rice and other commodities went up. Flor (2007) said: &lt;blockquote&gt;Rice farmers who were expected to gain from the situation were likewise disadvantaged. They were not able to sell their produce at reasonable prices. On one hand, their bumper crop entailed expensive inputs – certified high yielding varieties, irrigation, pesticides and fertilizer. On the other, middle men bought their harvest at cutthroat prices leaving them penniless and in debt… the nature of the rice industry is such that information, particularly market information, means money and power. For all practical purposes, the Philippine rice industry is controlled by a group of obscure Filipino-Chinese businessmen called the Binondo Rice Cartel… Employing a nationwide marketing network composed mainly of fellow Filipino-Chinese traders, the cartel has held a viselike grip over rice trading since the post World War II years that enable them to virtually dictate the buying price of dried paddy all over the country (pp. 114–115).&lt;/blockquote&gt;What was done when this happened? Did development communication come into the picture? Was change sought? There were a few discussions on alternatives such as proper use of funds since it was observed that international donations for the agricultural farmers were spent more on the informatisation of agriculture (increasing need for computers, logistical aids, etc.) instead of investing into more practical and realistic methods to empower the farmers and improve their farming methods. Attention was also given to the rise of white-collar jobs which was cutting down the numbers of agricultural farmers tilling the land (Flor, 2007). The youths became more attracted to the life in the city and to seek for office or desk jobs than remain in the province and till the farm. With this, Flor (2007) suggested policy rationalisation: &lt;blockquote&gt;Rationalisation need not mean a reduction of monies awarded to the information sector. It primarily means the rearrangement of priorities and the increase of allotment to actual farming activities in the case of agriculture or to direct social services in the case of rural development. (p. 123).&lt;/blockquote&gt;However, with the seemingly hegemonic influence of the internet and the impact of globalisation, the field of agriculture needs to adapt to radical changes in society for it to become sustainable. As policy sciences and development communication suggest, the goal of communication and policies is to empower individuals or groups, and this empowerment necessitates crucial adaptation to an ever-changing world. This brought agriculture into another layer: e-agriculture. What is e-agriculture? The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO, 2013) defined this as: &lt;block quote&gt;An emerging field focusing on the enhancement of agricultural and rural development through improved information and communication processes. More specifically, e-Agriculture involves the conceptualization, design, development, evaluation and application of innovative ways to use information and communication technologies (ICT) in the rural domain, with a primary focus on agriculture (p.&amp;nbsp;1).

In a post on e-Agriculture webpage, Walter (2009), indicates that the Philippines has launched a Knowledge Working Towards Enhancing Agricultural Communities Program or K-Agrinet project with the aim to promoting the use of ICT to attain agricultural sustainability and competitiveness for the country's farmers. The project is a collaborative effort amongst the country's diverse agencies to utilize information technology (IT) as a tool to fast-track the dissemination of agriculture and natural resources information and technologies to farmers, upland dwellers, and rural entrepreneurs in the Philippines. The institutional key players in the agricultural and natural resource sectors are: (1) the e-Learning led by the Open Academy for Philippine Agriculture of the Department of Agriculture-Philippine Rice Research Institute (DA-PhilRice) which focuses on e-extension and distance learning for agriculture extension workers; (2) the e-Consortia led by the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry and Natural Resources Research and Development (DOST-PCARRD) which intensifies technology and knowledge generation and exchange amongst existing partner R&amp;D Institutions through improved ICT tools and applications; (3) the e-Farm also led by DOST-PCARRD that promotes e-commerce by initiating e- based farm to market opportunities through the FITS centers and their respective farmer-scientists; and lastly, (4) the e-Agrikultura led by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) and Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP) tasked at mobilising and generating the participation of agrarian reform communities into the program (Walter, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;1).

Indeed, the goal of C4D and e-agriculture is clear: to improve the lives of people especially the poor and the marginalised. This entails educating and empowering them for the impact of change to be sustainable.

== Women's roles on development through advancing policies ==
Reports and studies show that women are mostly victims of many kinds of abuse. For instance, Kaunda (1990) described that a smallholder development strategy in Malawi, Africa puts emphasis on commercialization of agriculture, combined with decision making processes which are centralized in the bureaucracy, serving only to reproduce and perpetuate historical forms of social differentiation which are the basis of the women's subordination and/or subjugation.

However, it can be seen in the past few decades that women have been successful in championing a cause and in letting their voices be heard in the society. Women from all walks of life have been engaging themselves into some development projects. For Instance, in the Philippines, the World Food Programme (WFP, 2012) launched a project in the Philippine island of Mindanao to helping women kick start agriculture in the region by providing them with the training they need to become successful farmers. This shows that women can be empowered and independent – two qualities that development communication and policy sciences are championing. HumanaPeopletoPeople (2012) is also promoting gender equality in India, whereby, to release the empowerment of women, the women in their communities have formed coalitions such as women self-help groups focusing on community projects. The women are empowered to bargain, to have economic influence, to earn money for improvement of health and education of the family and to gain a stronger social standing.

Either in the First World or in the Third World nations, a huge number of women are making a difference in a lot of fields with the goal to contribute to character and nation-building. In the field of developing women's capacities to run and manage their small-medium enterprises (SMEs), Gail Romero, the founder and CEO for Collective Changes, has been providing effective technology platforms to business mentors for women's SMEs in developing nations. &lt;blockquote&gt;Gail continues to drive support for empowering women in business and global recognition of the economic engine that women can provide to their nations. Gail is also Senior Advisor for MacKenzie-Romero Consulting, Executive Producer for Rainmakers TV and carried the title of Ambassador for Global Health for the American Cancer Society until August 2011. Gail has spent the last two decades creating and directing the development and integration of innovative economic ideas and campaigns and strategic alliances with policy makers to advance women in leadership throughout the world… She has held numerous corporate board positions for start-up companies and guided new social venture partnerships. She has served as a visiting professor and international speaker and presenter on social justice, women's issues and education. Gail is a recent TED Prize nominee for her work to leverage technology to grow women's business skills ("Advancing Women in Leadership", 2014).&lt;/blockquote&gt;Development communication and policy sciences have gone a long way to advancing the rights and freedom of people – children and youths, women, farmers, labourers, etc., with the goal that they become more informed and empowered to make decisions for themselves and their communities, to realise their full potential and to become a catalyst for change as Flor (2007) postulated.

== Agenda setting ==
Agenda setting is an important topic in the Development Communication and policy sciences because it sets problems and issues into policies. It sets the tone of how policies are crafted, based on the needs of the public.  Equally important in this discussion is understanding the Agenda Setting Process by which problems and alternative solutions gain or lose public and elite attention (Birkland, 2011).  It is in this area where individuals take collective action and vie for attention.  According to Schattschneider (1960), groups that successfully describe a problem will also be the one to define the solutions to it, thereby prevailing in public debate.

Another idea offered by Schattschneider is the Theory of Group Mobilization &amp; Participation in Agenda Setting wherein the issues are more likely to be elevated to agenda status if the scope of conflict is broadened.  There are 2 ways to broaden an issue:
# Groups go public by using symbols and images or;
# Groups to lose the first level of public interest appeal to a higher decision-making level.
When powerful groups lose control of the agenda, they are said to enter into policy debates to gain attention (Baumgartner &amp; Jones), while other groups do venue shopping and ally with those who are able to advance their issues.&lt;ref name="Birkland"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giw8dRLqX74C|title=An Introduction to the Policy Process: Theories, Concepts, and Models of Public Policy Making|last=Birkland|first=Thomas A.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=9780765627315|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Levels of Agenda'''&lt;ref name="Birkland"/&gt;

From the vast field of issues (Agenda Universe), groups push issues meriting public attention "within the legitimate jurisdiction of existing governmental authority" (Birkland, quoting Cobb and Elder), moving to the next level (Systemic Agenda).  Ideas that gain active and serious consideration of decision/policy makers go the next level (Institutional Agenda).  If acted upon, it reaches Decision Agenda—the last level in the policy making process.  Within these levels there are push and pull actions that happen between and among interest groups in order to pursue or challenge such initiatives.

'''Process of Policy Development (also Stages of the Policy Cycle)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Public Policy Analysis|last=Fischer|first=Frank|publisher=CSC Press|year=2007|isbn= 1-57444-561-8|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=72–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes the following activities that sets off creation of policies:
# Issue Framing – which is a technique of getting the issues on the policy maker's agenda so that a problem is recognized and debated.
# Agenda setting as already discussed in previous paragraphs.
# Policy Formulation wherein proposed actions are articulated, debated and drafter into language.
# Advocacy &amp; policy dialogue which will involve and mobilize stakeholders and the public, and
# Data analysis which focuses on political costs and benefits.

A '''Gaian''' is a radical [[Green politics|Green]] who views the [[ecology]] of the Earth's [[biosphere]] not only as the basis of human moral examples, but of all [[cognition]] and even [[sentience]].  Advocates of this view claim that since we live as part of one planet's [[photosynthesis]] chain and are trapped within its [[gravity]] well, we are effectively components of one large body&amp;mdash;that being the global ecology of Earth itself.

Another name for this [[value theory]] is "[[radical values environmentalism]]," which holds that individuals and societies are ways to create such a thriving [[ecosystem]], but cannot be considered as being ends in themselves.

An early advocate of this view was [[Buckminster Fuller]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} who developed the [[Dymaxion Map]] of the world, the first [[world projection]] to show the [[continent]]s on a flat surface without visible distortion&amp;mdash;and the earth as being essentially one island in one [[ocean]].  In ''[[Critical Path (book)|Critical Path]]'', 1981, he claimed to prove that "gravity is love."{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Critics say this view makes humans "slaves of the Earth" and argue that human destiny is to spread out to find or form many living worlds.  In contrast, some ''Gaians'' see such colonists as locusts or a disease, and may see all human beings as elements of a single Earth-wide ecology, if not [[organism]].  They are often hard to differentiate from members of the [[New Age]] movement, with which they share the goal of deep [[spirituality|spiritual]] integration.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Political Gaians are a relatively recent offshoot of the [[ecology movement]]&amp;mdash;and get their name from the [[Gaia hypothesis]], a postulate first devised by [[James Lovelock]] holding that the [[biosphere]] tends to [[homeorhetic balance]] or even [[homeostasis]] (with the implication that human beings should be working toward such balances or states.)

'''Gamelan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|æ|m|ə|l|æ|n}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells|first=John|authorlink=John C. Wells|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|publisher=Pearson Longman|edition=3rd|date=April 3, 2008|isbn=1405881186}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[traditional music|traditional]] [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] music of [[Java]] and [[Bali]] in [[Indonesia]], made up predominantly of [[percussion instrument|percussive instruments]]. The most common instruments used are [[metallophone]]s played by mallets and a set of hand-played drums called ''[[kendhang]]'' which register the [[beat (music)|beat]]. Other instruments include [[xylophone]]s, [[bamboo flute]]s, a [[string instrument|bowed instrument]] called a ''[[rebab]]'', and even vocalists called ''[[sindhen]]''.&lt;!--Instruments are built and tuned to stay together&amp;nbsp;– as a result, instruments from different gamelans are generally not interchangeable.--&gt;&lt;ref name=sumarsam&gt;Sumarsam (1998). [http://sumarsam.web.wesleyan.edu/Intro.gamelan.pdf ''Introduction to Javanese Gamelan'']. Middletown.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the popularity of gamelan has declined since the introduction of pop music, gamelan is still commonly played on formal occasions and in many traditional Indonesian ceremonies. For most Indonesians, gamelan is an integral part of [[Indonesian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Bramantyo Prijosusilo, '[http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/commentary/indonesia-needs-the-harmony-of-the-gamelan/423530 Indonesia needs the Harmony of the Gamelan'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115102945/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/commentary/indonesia-needs-the-harmony-of-the-gamelan/423530 |date=2013-01-15 }}, ''The Jakarta Globe'', 22 February 2011. {{verification needed|date=June 2014|reason=Article states that gamelan "once was so much a part of community life" that each village had a set, but at most refers to its relative loss of importance today.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
The word '''''gamelan''''' comes from the [[Javanese language#Registers|low Javanese]] word ''gamel'', which may refer to a type of mallet used to strike instruments or the act of striking with a mallet.&lt;ref name=sumarsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindsay"&gt;Lindsay, Jennifer (1992). ''Javanese Gamelan'', p.10. {{ISBN|0-19-588582-1}}.&lt;!--ibid later--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''''karawitan''''' refers to classical gamelan music and performance practice, and comes from the word ''rawit'', meaning 'intricate' or 'finely worked'.&lt;ref name="Lindsay"/&gt; The word derives from the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] word of [[Sanskrit]] origin, ''rawit'', which refers to the sense of smoothness and elegance idealized in Javanese music. Another word from this root, ''pangrawit'', means a person with such sense, and is used as an honorific when discussing esteemed gamelan musicians. The high Javanese word for ''gamelan'' is '''''gangsa''''', formed either from the words ''tembaga'' and ''rejasa'' referring to the materials used in bronze gamelan construction (copper and tin), or ''tiga'' and ''sedasa'' referring to their proportions (three and ten).&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay (1992), p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Musician Borobudur.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Musicians performing musical ensemble, bas-relief of [[Borobudur]]]]
[[File:Gong and Chime Culture Map.jpg|thumb|right|The three major indigenous genres of gong-chime music prevalent in Southeast Asia: this includes the ''gamelan'' of western Indonesia; the ''[[kulintang]]'' of the southern Philippines, eastern Indonesia, and eastern Malaysia; and the ''[[piphat]]'' of Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Burma]]
&lt;!--[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gamelanorkest TMnr 60015940.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Gamelan orchestra (1870-1891)]]--&gt;
The gamelan predates the [[Indianized kingdoms|Hindu-Buddhist culture]] that dominated Indonesia in its earliest records and thus represents an indigenous art form. In contrast to the heavy [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] influence in other art forms, the only obvious [[Music of India|Indian influence]] in gamelan music is in the Javanese style of singing, and in the themes of the [[Wayang kulit]] (shadow puppet plays).&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Javanese mythology, the gamelan was created by Sang Hyang Guru in [[Saka era]] 167 (c. AD 230), the god who ruled as king of all Java from a palace on the Maendra mountain in [[Medang Kamulan]] (now [[Mount Lawu]]). He needed a signal to summon the gods and thus invented the gong. For more complex messages, he invented two other gongs, thus forming the original gamelan set.&lt;ref&gt;R.T. Warsodiningrat, ''Serat Weda Pradangga''. Cited in Roth, A. R. ''New Compositions for Javanese Gamelan''. University of Durham, Doctoral Thesis, 1986. Page 4.&lt;!--ibid later--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest image of a musical ensemble is found on the bas-relief of 8th century Buddhist monument of [[Borobudur]], Central Java.&lt;ref name="ThoughtCo-Gamelan"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-gamelan-195131|title=Learn the History Behind Gamelan, Indonesian Music and Dance|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Borobudur's musicians play [[lute]]-like stringed instruments, ''[[kendang]]'' drums, ''[[suling]]'' flutes, small [[cymbal]]s and bells. Some of these musical instruments are indeed included in a complete gamelan orchestra. Musical instruments such as the bamboo flute, bells, drums in various sizes, lute, and bowed and plucked string instruments were identified in this image. However it lacks metallophones and xylophones. Nevertheless, the image of this musical ensemble is suggested to be the ancient form of the gamelan.

The instruments developed into their current form during the [[Majapahit Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;The Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia, ''Bulletin for National Museum of Canada'' (Ottawa: April 1961), p.2, cited in Donald A. Lentz. ''The Gamelan Music of Java and Bali: An Artistic Anomaly Complementary to Primary Tonal Theoretical Systems''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1965. Page 5.&lt;!--ibid later--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the inscriptions and manuscripts dated from the Majapahit period, the kingdom even had a government office in charge of supervising the performing arts, including the gamelan. The arts office oversaw the construction of musical instruments, as well as scheduling performances at the court.&lt;ref name="ThoughtCo-Gamelan"/&gt;

In the palaces of [[Java]] the oldest known ensembles, Gamelan ''[[Munggang]]'' and ''Gamelan Kodok Ngorek'', are apparently from the 12th century. These formed the basis of a "loud style" of music. In contrast, a "soft style" developed out of the ''[[kemanak]]'' tradition and is related to the traditions of singing [[Javanese poetry]], in a manner  often believed to be similar to the chorus that accompanies the modern ''[[bedhaya]]'' dance. In the 17th century, these loud and soft styles mixed, and to a large extent the variety of modern gamelan styles of Bali, Java, and Sunda resulted from different ways of mixing these elements. Thus, despite the seeming diversity of styles, many of the same theoretical concepts, instruments, and techniques are shared between the styles.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 4–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
A gamelan is a multi-timbre ensemble consisting of metallophones, xylophones, flutes, gongs, voices, as well as bowed and plucked strings. The hand-played drum called ''kendhang''  controls the tempo and rhythm of pieces as well as transitions from one section to another, while one instrument gives melodic cues to indicate treatment or sections of a piece. Some of the instruments that make up a gamelan in present-day Central Java are shown below:&lt;ref name=drummond&gt;Drummond, Barry.

==Varieties==
{{See also|List of gamelan varieties}}
Varieties of gamelan are distinguished by their collection of instruments and use of voice, tunings, repertoire, style, and cultural context. In general, no two gamelan ensembles are the same, and those that arose in prestigious courts are often considered to have their own style and tuning. Certain styles may also be shared by nearby ensembles, leading to a regional style.

The varieties are generally grouped geographically, with the principal division between the styles favored by the [[Balinese people|Balinese]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], and [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] peoples. The Madurese also had their own style of gamelan, although it is no longer in use, and the last orchestra is kept at the Sumenep palace.&lt;ref&gt;''Across Madura Strait: the dynamics of an insular society'', edited by Kees van Dijk, Huub de Jonge and Elly Touwen-Bouwsma.{{full citation needed|date=June 2014|reason=missing year and page}}&lt;/ref&gt; One important style of Sundanese gamelan is  ''[[Gamelan Degung]]'', which uses a subset of gamelan instruments with a particular mode of ''[[pelog]]'' scale. Balinese gamelan is often associated with the virtuosity and rapid changes of tempo and dynamics of ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar]]'', its best-known style. Other popular Balinese styles include ''[[Kecak]]'', a theatrical dance and music form also known as the "monkey chant." Javanese gamelan, largely dominated by the courts of the 19th century central Javanese rulers, each with its own style,  is known for a slower, more meditative quality than the gamelan music of Bali.  Javanese gamelan can be made from iron or brass; instruments  made of cast bronze are considered the best quality.

Outside the main core on [[Java]] and [[Bali]], gamelan has spread through migration and cultural interest, new styles sometimes resulting as well. [[Malay Gamelan]] comes from the Javanese tradition through Riau-Lingga which later formed its own distinct identity,  using fewer instruments tuned in a near-equidistant ''slendro'', and often using a western B{{music|b}} or C as a tuning basis. Javanese emigrants to Suriname play gamelan in a style close to that found in Central Javanese villages.  Gamelan is also related to the [[Filipino people|Filipino]] ''[[kulintang]]'' ensemble. The variety of gamelan can befound in over 25 countries outside Indonesia, presenting both traditional and experimental repertoire.

In oral Javanese culture distinctions are made between complete or incomplete, archaic and modern, and large standard and small village gamelan. The various archaic ensembles are distinguished by their unique combinations of instruments and possession of obsolete instruments such as the bell-tree (''byong'') in the 3-toned ''gamelan kodhok ngorek''. Regionally variable village gamelan are often distinguished from standard gamelan (which have the ''rebab'' as the main melodic instrument) by their inclusion of a double-reed wind (''selompret'', ''slompret'', or ''sompret'') in addition to variable drum and gong components, with some also including the shaken bamboo ''angklung''.&lt;ref&gt;Kartomi, Margaret (1990). ''On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments''. University of Chicago Press, p.&amp;nbsp;91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural context==
[[File:Javanese Gamelan.jpg|thumb|left|360px|Javanese gamelan ensemble with two female ''[[sindhen]]'' (choral singer) during traditional Javanese wedding at Sasono Utomo, [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]], [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]]]

In Indonesia, gamelan often accompanies dance, ''[[wayang]]'' puppet performances, or rituals and ceremonies. Typically players in the gamelan will be familiar with dance moves and poetry, while dancers are able to play in the ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of dance in Central Java in [[Surakarta]], see Ganug Nugroho Adi, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/30/dancing-mangkunegara.html Dancing at the Mangkunegara'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 30 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[wayang]]'', the ''[[dhalang|dalang]]'' (puppeteer) must have a thorough knowledge of gamelan, as he gives the cues for the music. Gamelan can be performed by itself&amp;nbsp;– in "''klenengan''" style, or for radio broadcasts&amp;nbsp;– and concerts presentation are common in national arts conservatories founded in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, Simon, et al., eds. ''World Music: The Rough Guide''. London: The Rough Guides, 1994. {{ISBN|1-85828-017-6}}. Page 419–420.&lt;!--ibid later--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Gamelan's role in rituals is so important that there is a Javanese saying, "It is not official until the gong is hung".&lt;ref name="B420"&gt;Broughton, 420&lt;/ref&gt; Some performances are associated with royalty, such as visits by the [[sultan of Yogyakarta]]. Certain gamelans are associated with specific rituals, such as the ''[[Gamelan Sekaten]]'', which is used in celebration of ''[[Mawlid an-Nabi]]'' ([[Muhammad]]'s birthday). In [[Bali]], almost all religious rituals include gamelan performance. Gamelan is also used in the ceremonies of the [[Catholicism in Indonesia|Catholic church in Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, 45&lt;/ref&gt; Certain pieces are designated for starting and ending performances or ceremonies. When an "ending" piece (such as "[[Udan Mas]]") is begun, the audience will know that the event is nearly finished and will begin to leave. Certain pieces are also believed to possess magic powers, and can be used to ward off evil spirits.&lt;ref name="B420"/&gt;

Gamelan is frequently played on the radio. For example, the ''[[Pura Pakualaman]]'' gamelan performs live on the radio every ''Minggu Pon'' (a day in the 35-day cycle of the [[Javanese calendar]]).&lt;ref name="B420"/&gt; In major towns, the [[Radio Republik Indonesia]] employs professional musicians and actors, and broadcast programs of a wide variety of gamelan music and drama.&lt;ref name="B421"&gt;Broughton, 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the court tradition of central [[Java]], gamelan is often played in the ''[[pendopo]]'', an open pavilion with a cavernous, double-pitched roof, no side walls, and a hard marble or tile floor. The instruments are placed on a platform to one side, which allows the sound to reverberate in the roof space and enhances the acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, 17&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bali Lion Dance.jpg|thumb|240x240px|Gamelan ensemble (or [[Beleganjur|gambelan]] in Balinese term) accompanying [[Barong (mythology)|barong]] performance (Bali [[lion dance]]) at [[Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park|Garuda Wisnu Kencana cultural complex]].]]
In [[Bali]], the Gamelan instruments are all kept together in a ''balé'', a large open space with a roof over the top of it and several open sides. Gambelan (the [[Balinese language|Balinese]] term) are owned by a ''[[banjar (Bali)|banjar]]'', nobility or temples and kept in their respective compounds.

In case of ''banjar'' ownership the instruments are all kept there together because people believe that all the instruments belong to the community as a whole and that no one person has ownership over an instrument.  Not only is this where the instruments are stored, but this is also the practice space for the ''sekaha'' (Gamelan orchestra group). The open walls allow for the music to flow out into the community where the rest of the people may enjoy it. Balinese gamelan cannot be heard inside closed rooms, because it easily crosses the [[Threshold of pain#In hearing|threshold of pain]]. This does not apply to small ensembles like a gamelan ''[[gendér]]''.

The ''sekaha'' is led by a single instructor whose job it is in the community to lead this group and to come up with new pieces. When they are working on a new piece, the instructor will lead the group in practice and help the group form the new music as they are practicing. When the instructor creates a new song, he leaves enough open for interpretation that the group can improvise, so the group will write the music as they practice it.

There are many styles in Balinese gamelan. ''[[Kebyar]]'' is one of the most recent ones. Some Balinese gamelan groups constantly change their music by taking older pieces they know and mixing them together, as well as trying new variations of the music. Their music constantly changes because they believe that music should grow and change; the only exception to this is with their most sacred songs which they do not change. A single new piece of music can take several months before it is completed.

Men and women usually perform in separate groups, with the exception in Java of the ''[[pesindhen]]'', the female singer who performs with male groups.&lt;ref name="B421"/&gt;

In the twenty-five countries outside Indonesia that have gamelan, music performed in a concert context or as part of ceremonies for expat communities&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.balipuspa.de/Kuningan%20im%20rjm.htm Kuningan: Ein Balinesisches Kulturfest]", ''BaliPusa.de''. (German)&lt;/ref&gt; may also accompany [[Indonesian dance|dance]] or ''[[wayang]]''.

==Tuning==
[[File:165 Museu de la Música, gamelan.jpg|thumb|Gamelan in [[Museu de la Música de Barcelona]]]]
[[File:Traditional indonesian stringed instrument.jpg|thumb|''[[Celempung]]''&amp;nbsp;– Indonesian Embassy in [[Canberra]]]]

The tuning and construction of a gamelan orchestra is a complex process.&lt;ref&gt;Ganug Nugroho Adi, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/06/07/ki-saroyo-gamelan-making-maestro.html Ki Sarojo: Gamelan-making maestro'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 7 June 2012; Ganug Nugroho Adi, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/07/11/forging-gamelan-central-java.html Forging gamelan in Central Java'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 11 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Javanese gamelan use two [[musical tuning|tuning systems]]: ''[[sléndro]]'' and ''[[pélog]]''. There are other tuning systems such as ''[[degung]]'' (exclusive to Sunda, or West Java), and ''[[madenda]]'' (also known as ''diatonis'', similar to a European [[natural minor scale]]). In central Javanese gamelan, ''sléndro'' is a system with five [[Musical note|note]]s to the [[octave]], with large intervals, while ''pélog'' has seven notes to the octave, with uneven [[interval (music)|intervals]], usually played in five note subsets of the seven-tone collection.  A full gamelan will include a set of instruments in each tuning, and classically only one tuning is used at a time. The precise tuning used differs from ensemble to ensemble, and gives each ensemble its own particular flavour. A set of gamelan instruments will be tuned to the same set of notes, but the tuning will vary from one gamelan to the next, including variations in the size of intervals.

[[Colin McPhee]] , a Canadian composer who spent much time in Bali, remarked, "Deviations in what is considered the same scale are so large that one might with reason state that there are as many scales as there are gamelans."&lt;ref&gt;Colin McPhee, ''Music in Bali''. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is contested, however, by some teachers of gamelan, and there have been efforts to combine multiple ensembles and tuning structures into one gamelan to ease transportation at festival time. One such ensemble is gamelan ''Manikasanti'', which can play the repertoire of many different ensembles.

Balinese gamelan instruments are built in pairs that are tuned slightly apart to produce interference [[beat (acoustics)|beats]], ideally at a consistent speed for all pairs of notes in all registers. This concept is referred to as "ombak," translating to "wave," communicating the idea of cyclical undulation. One instrument, tuned slightly higher, is thought of as the "inhale," and the other, slightly lower, is called the "exhale." [Also called the "blower" and the "sucker," or ''pengimbang'' and ''pengisep'' in Bali.] When the inhale and the exhale are combined, beating is produced, meant to represent the beating of the heart, or the symbol of being alive. It is thought that this contributes to the "shimmering" sound of Balinese gamelan ensembles. In the religious ceremonies that contain gamelan, these interference beats are meant to give the listener a feeling of a god's presence or a stepping stone to a meditative state. The scale roughly approximates that of the [[phrygian mode]] of the Western major scale (E-E on the white keys of the piano), with the notes EFGBC corresponding to the note positions 12356 in the ''slendro'' scale used by most gamelan.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cnx.org/content/m15795/latest/ Listening to Balinese Gamelan: A Beginners' Guide]" from ''Connexions.com'' retrieved 20/01/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the non-western octave and the use of beats, [[Java]]nese gamelan uses a combination of tempo and density known as ''[[Irama]]'', relating how many beats on the ''[[saron panerus]]'' instrument there are to notes in the core melody or ''[[balungan]]''; density is considered primary.&lt;ref&gt;Sumarsan. ''Gamelan: cultural interaction and musical development in central Java''. University of Chicago Press, 2nd Edition, 1996. page 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==
{{further|Musical notation#Indonesia}}

Gamelan music is traditionally not notated and began as an [[oral tradition]]. In the 19th century, however, the kraton (palaces) of [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]] developed distinct notations for transcribing the repertoire. These were not used to read the music, which was memorized, but to preserve pieces in the court records. The Yogyanese notation is a checkerboard notation, which uses six or seven vertical lines to represent notes of higher pitch in the [[balungan]] (melodic framework), and horizontal lines which represent the series of beats, read downward with time. The fourth vertical line and every fourth horizontal line (completing a ''[[gatra (music)|gatra]]'') are darkened for legibility. Symbols on the left indicate the [[colotomy|colotomic or metric structure]] of gongs and so forth, while specific drum features are notated in symbols to the right. The Solonese notation reads horizontally, like Western notation, but does not use barlines. Instead, note values and rests are squiggled between the notes.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Jennifer. ''Javanese Gamelan''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1979. Pp. 27–28. {{ISBN|0-19-580413-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today this notation is relatively rare, and has been replaced by [[kepatihan notation]], which is a cipher system. Kepatihan notation developed around 1900 at the [[kepatihan]] Palace in Surakarta, which had become a high-school conservatory. The pitches are numbered (see the articles on the scales ''[[slendro]]'' and ''[[pélog]]'' for an explanation of how), and are read across with dots below or above the numbers indicating the register, and lines above notes showing time values; In vocal notation, there are also brackets under groups of notes to indicate melisma. Like the palace notation, however, Kepatihan records mostly the ''balungan'' part and its metric phrases as marked by a variety of gongs. The other parts are created in real time, and depend on the knowledge each musician has of his instrument, and his awareness of what others are playing; this "realization" is sometimes called "garap." Some teachers have also devised certain notations, generally using kepatihan principles, for the ''[[cengkok]]'' (melodic patterns) of the [[elaborating instruments]]. Some ethnomusicologists, trained in European music, may make transcriptions onto a Western staff. This entails particular challenges of tuning and time, sometimes resulting in unusual [[clef]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in Sorrell, Neil. ''A Guide to the Gamelan''. United Kingdom: Faber and Faber, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Western music==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gamelanorkest TMnr 60043216.jpg|thumb|Gamelan orchestra in [[East Java]], late 19th century]]
The gamelan has been appreciated by several western composers of [[European classical music|classical music]], most famously [[Claude Debussy]] who heard a Javanese gamelan in the premiere of [[Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray]]'s ''Rhapsodie Cambodgienne'' at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Paris Exposition of 1889]] ([[World's Fair]]). The work had been written seven years earlier in 1882, but received its premiere only in 1889. The gamelan Debussy heard in it was in the ''slendro'' scale and was played by Central Javanese musicians.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Sorrell. ''A Guide to the Gamelan''. London: Faber and Faber, 2000. Pages 2–7 discuss the incident, about which much remains uncertain. In particular, it is unknown whether they played the [[Cirebon]]ese instruments that the [[Paris Conservatoire]] received in 1887, which would be substantially different from their ordinary set, or if they brought their own set.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his enthusiasm, direct citations of gamelan scales, melodies, rhythms, or ensemble textures have not been located in any of Debussy's own compositions. However, the equal-tempered [[whole tone scale]] appears in his music of this time and afterward,&lt;ref&gt;Neil Sorrell. ''A Guide to the Gamelan''. London: Faber and Faber, 2000. Although the five notes of the ''slendro'' set are closest in pitch to a [[pentatonic scale]], this scale would have been familiar from other folk sources, as it is a common scale worldwide. It is the equally tempered whole-tone scale that is more analogous of the exotic ''slendro'' scale.&lt;/ref&gt; and a Javanese gamelan-like heterophonic texture is emulated on occasion, particularly in "Pagodes", from ''Estampes'' (solo piano, 1903), in which the [[gong ageng|great gong]]'s [[colotomy|cyclic punctuation]] is symbolized by a prominent perfect fifth.

The composer [[Erik Satie]], an influential contemporary of Debussy, also heard the Javanese gamelan play at the Paris Exposition of 1889.  The repetitively hypnotic effects of the gamelan were incorporated into Satie's exotic [[Gnossienne]] set for piano.&lt;ref&gt;Orledge, Robert''Satie the Composer (Music in the Twentieth Century)''Cambridge University Press (October 26, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct homages to gamelan music are to be found in works for western instruments by [[John Cage]], particularly his [[prepared piano]] pieces, [[Colin McPhee]], [[Lou Harrison]], [[Béla Bartók]], [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Bronislaw Kaper]] and [[Benjamin Britten]]. In more recent times, American composers such as [[Henry Brant]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Dennis Murphy (musician)|Dennis Murphy]], [[Loren Nerell]], [[Michael Tenzer]], [[Evan Ziporyn]], [[Daniel James Wolf]] and [[Jody Diamond]] as well as Australian composers such as [[Peter Sculthorpe]], [[Andrew Schultz]] and [[Ross Edwards (composer)|Ross Edwards]] have written several works with parts for gamelan instruments or full gamelan ensembles. [[I Nyoman Windha]] is among contemporary Indonesian composers that have written compositions using western instruments along with Gamelan. Hungarian composer [[György Ligeti]] wrote a piano étude called ''Galamb Borong'' influenced by gamelan. [[Avant-garde]] composer [[Harry Partch]], one of America's most idiosyncratic composers, was also influenced by Gamelan, both in his [[microtonal]] compositions and the instruments he built for their performance&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.coastonline.org/mml/topic/topicsSearch_detail.php?id=312 Western Artists and Gamelan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307082145/http://www.coastonline.org/mml/topic/topicsSearch_detail.php?id=312 |date=2014-03-07 }}", ''CoastOnline.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In jazz, the music of [[Don Cherry (trumpeter)|Don Cherry]], especially his 1968 record ''Eternal Rhythm'', shows influences of gamelan music.

American folk guitarist [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]] included elements of gamelan in many of his late-1960s sound collages, and again in his 1997 collaboration with [[Cul de Sac (band)|Cul de Sac]], ''The Epiphany of Glenn Jones.''

On the debut EP of [[Sonic Youth]] the track 'She's not Alone' has a gamelan timbre. Experimental pop groups [[The Residents]], [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]] (whose 1984 album was even titled ''Urban Gamelan''), [[Mouse on Mars]], [[His Name Is Alive]], [[Xiu Xiu]], [[Macha (band)|Macha]], Saudade, [[The Raincoats]] and the [[Sun City Girls]] have used gamelan percussion. Avant-garde performance band [[Melted Men]] uses Balinese gamelan instruments as well as gamelan-influenced costumes and dance in their shows. The [[Moodswinger]] built by [[Yuri Landman]] gives gamelan–like clock and bell sounds, because of its [[3rd bridge]] construction. Indonesian-Dutch composer [[Sinta Wullur]] has integrated Western music and gamelan for opera.

==Influence on contemporary music==
In contemporary [[Indonesian music]] scene, some groups fuse contemporary westernized [[jazz fusion]] music with the legacy of traditional [[ethnic music]] traditions. In the case of [[Krakatau (band)|Krakatau]] and [[SambaSunda]], the bands from West Java, the traditional Sundanese [[kacapi suling]] and gamelan degung Sunda orchestra is performed alongside drum set, keyboard and guitars. Other bands such as Bossanova Java fused Javanese music with [[bossa nova]], while the Kulkul band fuse jazz with Balinese gamelan.

The Indonesian singer [[Anggun]] often incorporated in her works Indonesian traditional tunes from the gamelan and tembang style of singing. Typical gamelan tunes can be traced in several songs in her album ''[[Snow on the Sahara]]'' such as "[[Snow on the Sahara (song)|Snow on the Sahara]]", "[[A Rose in the Wind]]", and also in her collaboration works with [[Deep Forest]] on "Deep Blue Sea" on their 2002 album, ''Music Detected''. Philippine-born Indonesian singer [[Maribeth Pascua]] also features gamelan tunes in her songs ''Denpasar Moon'' and ''Borobudur''.

Beyond Indonesia, gamelan has also had an influence on [[J-pop|Japanese popular music]], specifically the [[synthpop]] band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]. Their 1981 record ''[[Technodelic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Monica|title=It's Easy When You're Big In Japan: Yellow Magic Orchestra at The Hollywood Bowl|work=The Vinyl District|url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/losangeles/2011/06/it%E2%80%99s-easy-when-you%E2%80%99re-big-in-japan-yellow-magic-orchestra-at-the-hollywood-bowl/|accessdate=22 July 2011|date=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the first albums to heavily rely on [[Sampling (music)|samples]] and [[Loop (music)|loops]], made use of gamelan elements and samples. Yellow Magic Orchestra member [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] also used gamelan elements for his soundtrack to the 1983 British-Japanese film ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pulvers|first=Roger|title=Ryuichi Sakamoto reminds Japanese what's the score on nuclear blame|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20120701rp.html#.UA4RzrSe78k|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Japan Times]]|date=July 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which won him the 1983 [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0085933|Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (1983)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many listeners were introduced to the sounds of gamelan by the popular 1988 Japanese [[anime]] film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]''. Gamelan elements are used in this film to punctuate several exciting fight scenes, as well as to symbolize the emerging psychic powers of the tragic hero, Tetsuo. The gamelan in the film's score was performed by the members of the [[Japan]]ese musical collective [[Geinoh Yamashirogumi]], using their ''semar pegulingan'' and ''jegog'' ensembles, which were also used in the previous album, ''Ecophony Rinne''. Gamelan and kecak are also used in the soundtrack to the video games ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' and ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]''. The two opening credits of 1998 Japanese [[Anime]] ''[[Neo Ranga]]'' use Balinese music (''Kecak'' and ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar]]''). Each "waking up" of Ranga in the anime uses the ''Gong Kebyar'' theme. The musical soundtrack for the Sci Fi Channel series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' features extensive use of the gamelan, particularly in the 3rd season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/81/ |title=SoundtrackNet 2/28/07 article |publisher=Soundtrack.net |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as do [[Alexandre Desplat]]'s scores for ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring (film)|Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' and ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]''. [[James Newton Howard]], who composed [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney's]] 2001 feature film ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', chose Gamelan for the musical theme of the Atlanteans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = Various cast and crew members | title = Atlantis: The Lost Empire—Supplemental Material | medium = DVD | edition = Collector's | series = Disc 2 of 2 | date = January 29, 2002 | publisher = Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment | location = Burbank, CA | id = {{UPC|786936163872}} | ref = DVD2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loops of gamelan music appear in electronic music. An early example is the Texas band [[Drain (band)|Drain]]'s album ''Offspeed and In There'', which contains two tracks where trip-hop beats are matched with gamelan loops from Java and Bali and recent popular examples include the [[Sofa Surfers]]' piece ''Gamelan'', or ''EXEC_PURGER/.#AURICA extracting'', a song sung by [[Haruka Shimotsuki]] as part of the ''[[Ar tonelico: Melody of Elemia]]'' soundtracks.

Gamelan influences can also be heard  in the 2004 award-winning pop song, ''Pulangkan'', a theme from the gamelan-cultural related film ''[[Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam]]'' by Malaysian songbird [[Misha Omar]] and also the 2006 hip hop song, Tokyo Drift (Fast &amp; Furious), by [[Teriyaki Boyz]].

In the ''[[Regular Show]]'' episode "150-Piece Kit", a gamelan is mentioned to be part of the eponymous kit.

==Gamelan outside Indonesia==

{{Main|Gamelan outside Indonesia}}

Gamelan is also found outside Indonesia. There are forms of gamelan that have developed outside Indonesia, such as [[American gamelan]] in the United States and [[Malay Gamelan]] in Malaysia. Gamelan has also become quite widespread along the South East of Sri Lanka, particularly with the Tamil community, and in Colombo, at the Indonesian Embassy.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Introduction==
Geography is a systematic study of the Universe and its features. Traditionally, geography has been associated with [[cartography]] and place names. Although many geographers are trained in [[toponymy]] and [[Cartography|cartology]], this is not their main preoccupation. Geographers study the [[space]] and the [[temporal database]] distribution of phenomena, processes, and features as well as the [[interaction]] of humans and their [[Natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref name="Hayes-Bohanan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webhost.bridgew.edu/jhayesboh/environmentalgeography.htm|title=What is Environmental Geography, Anyway?|last=Hayes-Bohanan|first=James|date=29 September 2009|website=webhost.bridgew.edu|publisher=[[Bridgewater State University]]|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because space and place affect a variety of topics, such as [[economics]], [[health]], [[climate]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, geography is highly interdisciplinary. The interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach depends on an attentiveness to the relationship between physical and human phenomena and its spatial patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Settlement_Geography.html?id=DLpzQgAACAAJ|title=An introduction to Settlement Geography|last=Hornby|first=William F.|last2=Jones|first2=Melvyn|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521282635|publication-date=29 June 1991|pages=|quote=|access-date=10 November 2016|via=|date=1991-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text= Names of places...are not geography...know by heart a whole [[gazetteer]] full of them would not, in itself, constitute anyone a [[geographer]]. Geography has higher aims than this: it seeks to classify phenomena (alike of the natural and of the political world, in so far as it treats of the latter), to compare, to generalize, to ascend from effects to causes, and, in doing so, to trace out the laws of nature and to mark their influences upon man. This is 'a description of the world'—that is Geography. In a word Geography is a Science—a thing not of mere names but of argument and reason, of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, William. (1863).

Geography as a discipline can be split broadly into two main subsidiary fields: [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]]. The former largely focuses on the [[built environment]] and how humans create, view, manage, and influence space. The latter examines the natural environment, and how [[organism]]s, climate, [[soil]], [[water]], and [[landform]]s produce and interact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What is geography? |work=AAG Career Guide: Jobs in Geography and related Geographical Sciences |publisher=American Association of Geographers |url=http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html |accessdate=October 9, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006152742/http://www.aag.org/Careers/What_is_geog.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between these approaches led to a third field, [[environmental geography]], which combines physical and human geography and concerns the interactions between the environment and humans.&lt;ref name="Hayes-Bohanan"/&gt;

==Branches==

===Physical geography===
{{Main|Physical geography}}

Physical geography (or physiography) focuses on geography as an [[Earth science]]. It aims to understand the physical problems and the issues of [[lithosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[pedosphere]], and global [[flora]] and [[fauna]] patterns ([[biosphere]]).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Human geography===
{{Main|Human geography}}

Human geography is a branch of geography that focuses on the study of patterns and processes that shape the human society. It encompasses the [[human]], [[politics|political]], [[culture|cultural]], [[social]], and [[economics|economic]] aspects.

&lt;gallery mode="packed" caption="Human geography can be divided into many broad categories, such as:"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Various approaches to the study of human geography have also arisen through time and include:
* [[Behavioral geography]]
* [[Feminist geography]]
* [[Culture theory]]
* [[Geosophy]]

===Environmental geography===
{{Main|Integrated geography}}

Environmental [[Integrated geography|geography]] is concerned with the description of the spatial interactions between humans and the [[Natural environment|natural world]]. It requires an understanding of the traditional aspects of physical and human geography, as well as the ways that human societies conceptualize the environment. Environmental geography has emerged as a bridge between the human and the physical geography, as a result of the increasing specialisation of the two sub-fields. Furthermore, as human relationship with the environment has changed as a result of [[globalization]] and [[technological change]], a new approach was needed to understand the changing and dynamic relationship. Examples of areas of research in the environmental geography include: [[emergency management]], [[environmental management]], [[sustainability]], and [[political ecology]].

===Geomatics===
{{Main|Geomatics}}

[[File:Geabios3d.jpg|thumb|right|Digital Elevation Model (DEM)]]
[[Geomatics]] is concerned with the application of computers to the traditional spatial techniques used in [[cartography]] and [[topography]]. Geomatics emerged from the [[quantitative revolution]] in geography in the mid-1950s. Today, geomatics methods include [[spatial analysis]], [[geographic information system|geographic information systems (GIS)]], [[remote sensing]], and [[global positioning system|global positioning systems (GPS)]]. Geomatics has led to a revitalization of some geography departments, especially in Northern America where the subject had a declining status during the 1950s.

===Regional geography===
{{Main|Regional geography}}

Regional geography is concerned with the description of the unique characteristics of a particular region such as its natural or human elements. The main aim is to understand, or define the uniqueness, or character of a particular region that consists of natural as well as human elements. Attention is paid also to [[regionalisation|regionalization]], which covers the proper techniques of space [[delimitation]] into regions.

===Related fields===
* [[Urban planning]], [[regional planning]], and [[spatial planning]]: Use the science of geography to assist in determining how to develop (or not develop) the land to meet particular criteria, such as safety, beauty, economic opportunities, the preservation of the built or natural heritage, and so on. The planning of towns, cities, and rural areas may be seen as [[applied geography]].
* [[Regional science]]: In the 1950s, the regional science movement led by [[Walter Isard]] arose to provide a more quantitative and analytical base to geographical questions, in contrast to the descriptive tendencies of traditional geography programs. Regional science comprises the body of knowledge in which the spatial dimension plays a fundamental role, such as [[regional science|regional economics]], [[resource management]], [[location theory]], [[urban planning|urban]] and [[regional planning]], [[transport]] and [[communication]], [[human geography]], population distribution, [[landscape ecology]], and environmental quality.
* [[Planetary science|Interplanetary Sciences]]: While the discipline of geography is normally concerned with the [[Earth]], the term can also be informally used to describe the study of other worlds, such as the [[planet]]s of the [[Solar System]] and even beyond. The study of systems larger than the Earth itself usually forms part of [[Astronomy]] or [[Cosmology]]. The study of other planets is usually called [[planetary science]]. Alternative terms such as [[Geology of Mars|areology]] (the study of Mars) have been proposed but are not widely used.

==Techniques==
As spatial interrelationships are key to this synoptic science, [[map]]s are a key tool. Classical [[cartography]] has been joined by a more modern approach to geographical analysis, computer-based [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).

In their study, geographers use four interrelated approaches:
* Systematic&amp;nbsp;– Groups geographical knowledge into categories that can be explored globally.
* Regional&amp;nbsp;– Examines systematic relationships between categories for a specific region or location on the planet.
* Descriptive&amp;nbsp;– Simply specifies the locations of features and populations.
* Analytical&amp;nbsp;– Asks ''why'' we find features and populations in a specific geographic area.

===Cartography===
[[File:Cook chart of New Zealand.jpg|thumb|[[James Cook]]'s 1770 chart of [[New Zealand]]]]
{{Main|Cartography}}

Cartography studies the representation of the Earth's surface with abstract symbols (map making). Although other subdisciplines of geography rely on maps for presenting their analyses, the actual making of maps is abstract enough to be regarded separately. Cartography has grown from a collection of drafting techniques into an actual science.

Cartographers must learn [[cognitive psychology]] and [[ergonomics]] to understand which symbols convey information about the Earth most effectively, and [[behaviorism|behavioural psychology]] to induce the readers of their maps to act on the information. They must learn [[geodesy]] and fairly advanced [[mathematics]] to understand how the [[Figure of the Earth|shape of the Earth]] affects the distortion of map symbols projected onto a flat surface for viewing. It can be said, without much controversy, that cartography is the seed from which the larger field of geography grew. Most geographers will cite a childhood fascination with maps as an early sign they would end up in the field.

===Geographic information systems===
{{Main|Geographic information system}}
&lt;!-- the section's use of a singular verb for a seemingly plural noun is intentional. The name of the academic subject is "Geographic information systems". If you didn't care about parallel construction, you could precede the following with THE SUBJECT OF ---&gt;
Geographic information systems (GIS) deal with the storage of information about the Earth for automatic retrieval by a computer, in an accurate manner appropriate to the information's purpose. In addition to all of the other subdisciplines of geography, GIS specialists must understand [[computer science]] and [[database]] systems. GIS has revolutionized the field of cartography: nearly all mapmaking is now done with the assistance of some form of [[List of GIS software|GIS software]]. GIS also refers to the science of using GIS software and GIS techniques to represent, analyse, and predict the spatial relationships. In this context, GIS stands for ''geographic information science''.

===Remote sensing===
{{Main|Remote sensing}}
Remote sensing is the science of obtaining information about Earth features from measurements made at a distance. Remotely sensed data comes in many forms, such as [[satellite imagery]], [[aerial photography]], and data obtained from hand-held sensors. Geographers increasingly use remotely sensed data to obtain information about the Earth's [[land surface]], ocean, and atmosphere, because it: (a) supplies objective information at a variety of spatial scales (local to global), (b) provides a synoptic view of the area of interest, (c) allows access to distant and inaccessible sites, (d) provides spectral information outside the visible portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], and (e) facilitates studies of how features/areas change over time. Remotely sensed data may be analysed either independently of, or in conjunction with other digital data layers (e.g., in a geographic information system).

===Quantitative methods===
{{Main|Geostatistics}}

[[Geostatistics]] deal with [[Numerical data|quantitative data]] analysis, specifically the application of statistical methodology to the exploration of geographic phenomena. Geostatistics is used extensively in a variety of fields, including [[hydrology]], [[geology]], [[petroleum]] exploration, weather analysis, [[urban planning]], [[logistics]], and [[epidemiology]]. The mathematical basis for geostatistics derives from [[cluster analysis]], [[linear discriminant analysis]] and [[non-parametric statistics|non-parametric statistical tests]], and a variety of other subjects. Applications of geostatistics rely heavily on [[geographic information system]]s, particularly for the [[interpolation]] (estimate) of unmeasured points. Geographers are making notable contributions to the method of quantitative techniques.

===Qualitative methods===
{{Main|Ethnography}}
Geographic qualitative methods, or ethnographical research techniques, are used by human geographers. In [[cultural geography]] there is a tradition of employing [[qualitative research]] techniques, also used in [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]]. [[Participant observation]] and in-depth interviews provide human geographers with qualitative data.

==History==
{{Main|History of geography}}

The oldest known [[world map]]s date back to [[ancient Babylon]] from the 9th century BC.&lt;ref name="Kurt A. Raaflaub &amp; Richard J.A.

The ideas of [[Anaximander]] (c. 610–545 BC): considered by later Greek writers to be the true founder of geography, come to us through fragments quoted by his successors. Anaximander is credited with the invention of the [[gnomon]], the simple, yet efficient Greek instrument that allowed the early measurement of [[latitude]]. [[Thales of Miletus|Thales]] is also credited with the prediction of eclipses. The foundations of geography can be traced to the ancient cultures, such as the ancient, medieval, and early modern [[History of China|Chinese]]. The [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], who were the first to explore geography as both [[art]] and [[science]], achieved this through [[History of cartography|Cartography]], [[Greek philosophy|Philosophy]], and [[Ancient Greek literature|Literature]], or through [[History of mathematics|Mathematics]]. There is some debate about who was the first person to assert that the [[Spherical Earth|Earth is spherical]] in shape, with the credit going either to [[Parmenides]] or [[Pythagoras]]. [[Anaxagoras]] was able to demonstrate that the profile of the Earth was circular by explaining [[eclipse]]s. However, he still believed that the Earth was a flat disk, as did many of his contemporaries. One of the first estimates of the radius of the Earth was made by [[Eratosthenes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Concise_History_of_Solar_and_Stellar_P.html?id=nRtUait0qTgC|title=A Concise History of Solar and Stellar Physics|first=Jean-Louis|last2=Tassoul|first2=Monique|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0691117119|location=London|pages=|quote=|access-date=10 November 2016|via=|author=Tassoul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first rigorous system of [[Geographic coordinate system|latitude and longitude]] lines is credited to [[Hipparchus]]. He employed a [[sexagesimal]] system that was derived from [[Babylonian mathematics]]. The meridians were sub-divided into 360°, with each degree further subdivided into 60 ([[minute of arc|minutes]]). To measure the longitude at different locations on Earth, he suggested using eclipses to determine the relative difference in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tmth.edu.gr/en/aet/3/58.html|title=Hipparchus of Rhodes|last=|first=|date=2001|website=tmth.edu.gr|publisher=[[Thessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720120522/http://www.tmth.edu.gr/en/aet/3/58.html|archive-date=20 July 2008|dead-url=yes|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive mapping by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] as they explored new lands would later provide a high level of information for [[Ptolemy]] to construct detailed [[atlas]]es. He extended the work of [[Hipparchus]], using a grid system on his maps and adopting a length of 56.5 miles for a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~cherlin/History/Papers2000/sullivan.html|title=Mapmaking and its History|last=Sullivan|first=Dan|date=2000|website=|publisher=[[Rutgers University]]|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 3rd century onwards, [[History of China|Chinese]] methods of geographical study and writing of geographical literature became much more comprehensive than what was found in Europe at the time (until the 13th century).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 512"/&gt; Chinese geographers such as [[Liu An]], [[Pei Xiu]], [[Jia Dan]], [[Shen Kuo]], [[Fan Chengda]], [[Zhou Daguan]], and [[Xu Xiake]] wrote important treatises, yet by the 17th century advanced ideas and methods of Western-style geography were adopted in China.

Turkish geographer, [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]] drew a world map on a linguistic basis, and later so did [[Piri Reis]] ([[Piri Reis map]]). Further, Islamic scholars translated and [[interpreting|interpreted]] the earlier works of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and established the [[House of Wisdom]] in [[Baghdad]] for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.islamicity.com/education/ihame/default.asp?Destination=/education/ihame/20.asp|title=Science and Scholarship in Al-Andalus|last=|first=|date=|website=IslamiCity.com|publisher=IslamiCity|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ahmed ibn Sahl al-Balkhi|Abū Zayd al-Balkhī]], originally from [[Balkh]], founded the "Balkhī school" of terrestrial mapping in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="E61-3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edson|first=Evelyn|last2=Savage-Smith|first2=Emilie|title=Medieval Views of the Cosmos|journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition|date=Winter 2007|volume=13:3|pages=61–63|jstor=30222166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suhrāb, a late tenth century Muslim geographer accompanied a book of geographical coordinates, with instructions for making a rectangular world map with [[equirectangular projection]] or cylindrical equidistant projection.&lt;ref name = E61-3/&gt;{{Verify source|date=October 2011}}

He also calculated the [[latitude]] of Kath, [[Khwarezm]], using the maximum altitude of the Sun, and solved a complex [[Geodesy|geodesic]] equation in order to accurately compute the [[Earth's circumference]], which was close to modern values of the Earth's circumference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/histgeol/biruni/biruni.htm|title=Abu Rayhan al-Biruni|last=Aber|first=James Sandusky|date=2003|website=academic.emporia.edu|publisher=[[Emporia State University]]|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His estimate of 6,339.9&amp;nbsp;km for the [[Earth radius]] was only 16.8&amp;nbsp;km less than the modern value of 6,356.7&amp;nbsp;km. In contrast to his predecessors, who measured the Earth's circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations, [[al-Biruni]] developed a new method of using [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] calculations, based on the angle between a [[plain]] and [[mountain]] top, which yielded more accurate measurements of the Earth's circumference, and made it possible for it to be measured by a single person from a single location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VJ6x-pcqMicC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;q=biruni|title=Avicenna|last=Goodman|first=Lenn Evan|publisher=Routledge|year=1992|isbn=978-0415019293|location=Great Britain|pages=31|quote=It was Biruni, not Avicenna, who found a way for a single man, at a single moment, to measure the earth's circumference, by trigonometric calculations based on angles measured from a mountaintop and the plain beneath it – thus improving on Eratosthenes' method of sighting the sun simultaneously from two different sites, applied in  the ninth century by astronomers of the Khalif al-Ma'mun.|access-date=10 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European [[Age of Discovery]] during the 16th and the 17th centuries, where many new lands were discovered and accounts by European explorers such as [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Marco Polo]], and [[James Cook]] revived a desire for both accurate geographic detail, and more solid theoretical foundations in Europe. The problem facing both explorers and geographers was finding the latitude and longitude of a geographic location. The problem of latitude was solved long ago but that of longitude remained; agreeing on what zero meridian should be was only part of the problem. It was left to [[John Harrison]] to solve it by inventing the chronometer [[Harrison Number Four|H-4]] in 1760, and later in 1884 for the [[International Meridian Conference]] to adopt by convention the [[Greenwich meridian]] as zero meridian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bz4GyOioMF4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA164#v=onepage|title=Voyages that changed the world|last=Aughton|first=Peter|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1847240040|location=|page=164|quote=|access-date=10 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th and the 19th centuries were the times when geography became recognized as a discrete [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]], and became part of a typical [[university]] curriculum in [[Europe]] (especially [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]]). The development of many geographic societies also occurred during the 19th century, with the foundations of the [[Société de Géographie]] in 1821,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.socgeo.org/la-societe/qui-sommes-nous|title=Société de Géographie, Paris, France|last=|first=|date=|website=socgeo.org|publisher=Société de Géographie|language=French|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1830,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/about+us.htm |title=About Us |last= |first= |date= |website=rgs.org |publisher=[[Royal Geographical Society]] |accessdate=10 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018192946/http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/About%2Bus.htm |archivedate=18 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian Geographical Society]] in 1845,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rgo.org.ru/ |title=Русское Географическое Общество (основано в 1845 г.) |last= |first= |date= |website=rgo.org.ru |publisher=[[Russian Geological Society]] |language=Russian |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120524183911/http://www.rgo.org.ru/ |archive-date=2012-05-24 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=10 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Geographical Society]] in 1851,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americangeo.org/history/|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=Amergeog.org|publisher=The American Geographical Society|accessdate=10 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017130118/http://americangeo.org/history/|archive-date=2016-10-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Geographic Society]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/io/unesco/members/48805.htm|title=National Geographic Society|last=|first=|date=|website=state.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Carl Ritter]], and [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] can be seen as a major turning point in geography from a philosophy to an academic subject.

Over the past two centuries, the advancements in technology with computers have led to the development of [[geomatics]] and new practices such as participant observation and geostatistics being incorporated into geography's portfolio of tools. In the West during the 20th century, the discipline of geography went through four major phases: [[environmental determinism]], [[regional geography]], the [[quantitative revolution]], and [[critical geography]]. The strong interdisciplinary links between geography and the sciences of [[geology]] and [[botany]], as well as [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[demographics]] have also grown greatly, especially as a result of [[earth system science]] that seeks to understand the world in a holistic view.

The '''I. M. Sechenov Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Biochemistry''' ('''IEPHB''') is a facility in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], dedicated to research in the fields of [[biochemistry]] and [[evolutionary physiology]].

== History ==

The Institute was founded as a research group in October 1950 by [[Leon Orbeli]], a physiologist and a longtime collaborator with [[Ivan Pavlov]].&lt;ref name="IEPHB"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iephb.ru/eng/history.htm| title = About Institute| accessdate = 2007-02-21| work = IEPHB website| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070304185459/http://www.iephb.ru/eng/history.htm| archivedate = 2007-03-04| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, Orheli's research group included eight people. It subsequently expanded and transformed into the ''Laboratory of Evolutionary Physiology'' of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|USSR Academy of Sciences]], with the main object of studying functions of the nervous system in animals and man during [[ontogenesis]], and also the effects of [[ionizing radiation]] on animals. 

In 1956, the Laboratory became an Institute with Orbeli serving as the first Director of Evolutionary Physiology of the Academy of Sciences. The new Institute was named after [[Ivan Sechenov]].  By the end of 1957, the Institute numbered 9 laboratories, one of them being transferred from the former [[Peter Lesgaft|P.F. Lesgaft]] Institute for Natural Sciences.

After Leon Orbeli's death in 1958, the Institute was headed by his collaborator Professor Alexander Ginetsinsky.  From June 1960 to March 1975, the Institute was guided by Eugenie Kreps: a former pupil of [[Ivan Pavlov]] and collaborator of Orbeli's, Kreps is known for his fundamental studies in the field of comparative physiology and biochemistry of the nervous system.  Kreps successfully promoted research in evolutionary biochemistry.  In response, in 1964, the Institute adopted its current name, ''I. M. Sechenov Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Biochemistry''.

In November 1969, a monument to [[Academician]] Orbeli was erected in front of the first laboratory block on [[Maurice Thorez]] Prospect.

From 1975 to 1981 Institute was headed by [[Vladimir Govyrin]], and from 1981 to 2004 by Vladimir Svidersky.  Since 2004, the Institute has been headed by N. P. Vesselkin, Corresponding Member of RAS, a distinguished [[neuroscientist]], and head of the Laboratory of Neuronal Interaction.

== Journal of Evolutionary Biochemistry and Physiology ==

The Institute is publisher of the ''Journal of Evolutionary Biochemistry and Physiology'' (ISSN 0022-0930) which is abstracted in the ''Chemical Abstracts''. The journal is also available [https://archive.is/20130203151056/http://springeronline.com/journal/10893 online] by subscription only (online ISSN 1608-3202).

'''Immunocomputing''' explores the principles of [[information processing]] that '''[[proteins]]''' and '''immune networks''' utilize in order to solve specific complex problems while protected from viruses, noise, errors and intrusions.

It intends to establish:

* A proper mathematical framework
* A new kind of [[computing]]
* A new kind of hardware

The main difference with other kinds of computing lay on the function of its ''basic element'', the '''formal protein''', defined according with its biological prototype and its [[mathematical model]]. 

The main [[biophysics|biophysical issues]] considered in immunocomputing are:

* Free '''[[Protein folding|folding]]''' to a stable state (inspiration for the Formal Protein)
* Free '''binding''' with other elements dependent on their reciprocal states (inspiration for the [[Immune network theory|Formal Immune Networks]])

'''Formal immune networks''' (FINs) have as closest model the ''idiotypic network'' of ''[[Niels Kaj Jerne|N. Jerne]]'' but they consider specific mechanisms of [[Protein-protein interaction|interactions between proteins]]. FINs are able to learn, recognize and solve problems.

'''Jakob Rosenberg''' (1893 – 1980) was a German-US art historian and [[Rembrandt]] scholar.

Rosenberg was born in [[Berlin]] into a family of art dealers and in the years 1912-1914 he first did an internship in the art trade in Munich. After serving in WWI he was captured by the British in 1915 and was sent to Switzerland by prisoner exchange. After the war he studied art history in Bern and Zurich, then in Frankfurt and Munich, where he received his doctorate under [[Heinrich Wölfflin]]. He then worked for [[Max J. Friedlander]] in the Berlin print cabinet ''[[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin]]'', where he also had contact with [[Wilhelm von Bode]]. In 1935 he beame a curator there but was dismissed the same year for racial reasons. After a visit to Harvard in 1936, Jakob Rosenberg emigrated to the United States in 1937, where he was admitted to Harvard University through Adolph Goldschmidt and his friend Paul Sachs. He was first a research fellow and lecturer, in 1940 associate professor and in 1947 full professor. His 1948 overview work on Rembrandt was reprinted in 1964 and 1968, holding its own as a standard work during the early years of the [[Rembrandt Research Project]]. He was also director of the Graphic Collection of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] from 1939.

In 1954 he was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

Jacob Rosenberg married Elisabeth Husserl, the daughter of [[Edmund Husserl]], in 1922.

Rosenberg died in [[Cambridge]].

== Function ==

KIF1A is a member of the [[kinesin]] family. This protein is highly similar to mouse heavy-chain kinesin member 1A protein, which is an anterograde motor protein that transports membranous organelles along [[axon]]al [[microtubule]]s. It is thought that this protein may play a critical role in the development of axonal [[neuropathy|neuropathies]] resulting from impaired axonal transport. There are multiple [[polyadenylation]] sites found in this gene.&lt;ref name="entrez"/&gt; [[Sexual orientation]] has been linked to the regulatory domain of the gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://ep70.eventpilotadmin.com/web/page.php?page=IntHtml&amp;project=ASHG15&amp;id=150123267|title = PgmNr 95: A novel predictive model of sexual orientation using epigenetic markers.|last = Ngun|first = Tuck|date = October 8, 2015|journal = American Society of Human Genetics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==
KIF1A is associated with [[hereditary spastic paraplegia|hereditary spastic paraparesis]].&lt;ref name="pmid21487076"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Erlich Y, Edvardson S, Hodges E, Zenvirt S, Thekkat P, Shaag A, Dor T, Hannon GJ, Elpeleg O | title = Exome sequencing and disease-network analysis of a single family implicate a mutation in KIF1A in hereditary spastic paraparesis | journal = Genome Res | volume = 21| issue = 5| pages = 658–64|date=April 2011 | pmid = 21487076 | doi = 10.1101/gr.117143.110 | pmc=3083082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kiepenheuer Institute for Solar Physics''' (abbreviation: KIS; {{lang-de|Kiepenheuer-Institut für Sonnenphysik}}) is a  [[research institute]] located in [[Freiburg]], [[Germany]]. Its research focuses on the exploration of the [[Sun]] and [[heliosphere]]. The institute has one [[solar telescope]] on the [[Schauinsland]] Mountain near Freiburg and, in collaboration with other institutions, uses solar telescopes of the [[Teide Observatory]] in [[Tenerife]], [[Spain]].

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1943 as the '[[Fraunhofer Institute]]' by [[Karl-Otto Kiepenheuer]]. Kiepenheuer was director of the Institute from 1943 until his death in 1975. The Institute was renamed as the 'Kiepenheuer Institute for Solar Physics' to honour the founder of the Institute and to enable the [[Fraunhofer Society]] to call their own institutes (the first of which was founded in 1954), 'Fraunhofer Institutes'. Both Institutions had been named independently after the physicist Joseph von Fraunhofer, and they had no other connection besides the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Michael|last = P.

==Outposts==
The solar observatory at the island of [[Capri, Italy]] was founded in 1954. The Coudé refractor became operational in 1966, and from that time the solar telescope on the Schauinsland continued to be used only for testing equipment. For several years, the Capri observatory with its domeless telescope provided observation time to the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-0-521-48393-3| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=p282ijnF3C0C&amp;pg=PA162|title = Unusual Telescopes|first = Peter L.|last = Manly|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|date = 1995|page = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Anton Bruzek (1915 2003)|doi=10.1023/A:1026160915011|date=2003|last1=Mattig|first1=Wolfgang|journal=Solar Physics|volume=216|issue=1/2|pages=1|bibcode = 2003SoPh..216....1M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0273-1177(91)90374-S|title=Large Earth-based Solar Telescope—LEST|date=1991|last1=Engvold|first1=O|journal=Advances in Space Research|volume=11|issue=5|pages=157|bibcode = 1991AdSpR..11..157E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00150314 |title=Fraunhofer Institut, Freiburg |date=1967 |last1=Kiepenheuer |first1=K.O. |issue=1 |journal=Solar Physics |volume=1 |bibcode=1967SoPh....1..162K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = The Domeless Solar Refractor of Capri Observatory|last = Kiepenheuer|first = K.

In the early 1970s, the Institute searched for a suitable place to establish a European solar observatory, and Karl-Otto Kiepenheuer took an active part in this search.&lt;ref name="Nach"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Nachrufe: Karl-Otto Kiepenheuer| last = Mattig|first = W.|volume = 38|date=1976| pages=11–13|journal = Mitteilungen der Astronomischen Gesellschaft |bibcode= 1976MitAG..38...11M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally the Spanish island of Tenerife was chosen, due its dry weather and stable atmosphere.

'''Legal education''' is the education of individuals in the principles, practices, and theory of [[law]]. It may be undertaken for several reasons, including to provide the knowledge and skills necessary for [[Admission to practice law|admission to legal practice]] in a particular jurisdiction, to provide a greater breadth of knowledge to those working in other professions such as politics or business, to provide current lawyers with advanced training or greater specialisation, or to update lawyers on recent developments in the law.

Legal education can take the form of a variety of programs, including: 
* Primary [[Law degree|degrees in law]], which may be studied at either undergraduate or graduate level depending on the country.
* Advanced academic degrees in law, such as [[Master of Laws|masters]] and doctoral degrees. 
* Practice or training courses, which prospective lawyers are required to pass in some countries before they may enter practice. 
* Applied or specialised law accreditation, which are less formal than degree programs but which provide specialised certification in particular areas. 
* [[Continuing legal education]], which do not lead to a qualification but provide practicing lawyers with updates on recent legal developments.

== History ==
Early Western legal education emerged in Republican Rome. Initially those desiring to be advocates would train in schools of [[rhetoric]]. Around the third century BC [[Tiberius Coruncanius]] began teaching law as a separate discipline.&lt;ref&gt;George Long article, p. 655 of ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Anqiquities'' by William Smith. John Murray, London 1875.&lt;/ref&gt; His public legal instruction had the effect of creating a class of legally skilled non-priests (''jurisprudentes''), a sort of consultancy. After Coruncanius' death, instruction gradually became more formal, with the introduction of books on law beyond the then scant official Roman legal texts.&lt;ref&gt;Unknown. "legal education." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 4 March 2007  &lt;http://secure.britannica.com/eb/article-9106475&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Coruncanius allowed members of the public and students to attend consultations with citizens in which he provided legal advice. These consultations were probably held outside the College of Pontiffs, and thus accessible to all those interested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:oo-U8MDJVJAJ:www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199276073/resources/timeline/jurists_rep2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canon and ecclesiastical law were studied in universities in medieval Europe. However, institutions providing education in the domestic law of each country emerged later in the eighteen century.

In England, legal education emerged in the late thirteenth century through apprenticeships. The Inns of Court controlled admission to practice and also provided some legal training. English universities had taught Roman and canon law for some time, but formal degrees focused on the native common law did not emerge until the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Boon and Julian Webb, '[http://letr.org.uk/references/storage/U7RC3RR2/Boon%20%26%20Webb,%20back%20to%20the%20future.pdf Legal Education and Training in England and Wales: Back to the Future?]' (2008) 58(1) ''Journal of Legal Education'' 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms of legal education ==

=== Primary degrees in law ===
[[File:Uppsala Gustavianum.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Gustavianum]]'', The Swedish [[Uppsala University]] built 1622–1625 and now a museum, was one of the pioneers in formal legal education]]
In many countries, including most of those in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the principal law degree is an [[undergraduate degree]], usually known as a [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB). Graduates of such a program are eligible to become lawyers by passing the country's equivalent of a [[bar exam]]. In these countries, graduate law programs are advanced degrees which allow for more in-depth study or specialisation.

In the [[Law school in the United States|United States]], the primary law degree is a graduate degree known as the [[Juris Doctor]] (JD). Students may pursue such a degree only after completing an undergraduate degree, usually a [[bachelor's degree]]. The undergraduate degree can be in any field, though most American lawyers hold bachelor's degrees in the humanities and social sciences. American law schools are usually an autonomous entity within a larger university.

Primary degrees in law are offered by [[law school]]s, known in some countries as faculties of law. Law schools may have varying degrees of autonomy within a particular university or, in some countries, can be entirely independent of any other post-secondary educational institution.

=== Advanced degrees in law ===
Higher degrees allow for more advanced academic study. These include the Masters of Law (LLM) by coursework or research, and doctoral degrees such as the [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] or SJD.

Practitioners may undertake a Masters of Law by coursework to obtain greater specialisation in an area in which they practice. In many common law countries, a higher degree in law is common and expected for legal academics. In addition, incorporating practical skills is beneficial for practitioners seeking higher degrees to better prepare them in their respective legal area of practice.&lt;ref&gt;SpearIt. “Drafting Legal Documents in a Doctrinal Class,” in Experiential Education in the Law School Curriculum (Carolina Academic Press 2017) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3021333 SSRN 3021333].&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, higher degrees in law are uncommon in the United States, even within the academy.

=== Practice or training courses ===
In some countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Canada and some states of Australia,&lt;ref&gt;NSW Law Society, [https://www.lawsociety.com.au/about/StudentHub/BecomingAdmitted/PLT/index.htm#1 'Practical Legal Training'], retrieved 8 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the final stages of vocational legal education required to qualify to practice law are carried out outside the university system. The requirements for qualification as a [[barrister]] or as a [[solicitor]] are covered in those articles.

=== Applied law programs or specialist accreditation ===
Legal education providers in some countries offer courses which lead to a certificate or accreditation in applied legal practice or a particular specialisation.

=== Continuing legal education ===
[[Continuing legal education]] (also known as continuing professional development) programs are informal seminars or short courses which provide legal practitioners with an opportunity to update their knowledge and skills throughout their legal career. In some jurisdictions, it is mandatory to undertake a certain amount of continuing legal education each year.

==Legal education in different countries==
{{Main article|Law school}}
===Australia===
{{Main article|List of law schools in Australia}}

In Australia most universities offer law as an undergraduate-entry course (LLB, 4 years), or combined degree course (e.g., BSc/LLB, BCom/LLB, BA/LLB, BE/LLB, 5–6 years). Some of these also offer a three-year postgraduate Juris Doctor (JD) program. [[Bond University]] in Queensland runs three full semesters each year, teaching from mid-January to late December. This enables the Bond University Law Faculty to offer the LLB in the usual 8 semesters, but only 2{{fraction|2|3}} years. They also offer a JD in two years. The [[University of Technology, Sydney]] will from 2010 offer a 2-year accelerated JD program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.uts.edu.au/courses/acceleratedjd.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111235355/http://www.law.uts.edu.au/courses/acceleratedjd.html |date=November 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[University of Melbourne]] introduced the [[Melbourne Model]], whereby Law is only available as a graduate degree, with students having to have completed a three-year bachelor's degree (usually an Arts degree) before being eligible.&lt;ref name="law.harvard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Law Program on the Legal Profession Comparative Analyses of Legal Education, Law Firms, and Law and Legal Procedure|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/plp/pages/comparative_analyses.php|publisher=Law.harvard.edu|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students in combined degree programs would spend the first 3 years completing their first bachelor's degree together with some preliminary law subjects, and then spend the last 2–3 years completing the law degree (JD). Alternatively, one can finish any bachelor's degree, and providing their academic results are high, apply for [[graduate entry|graduate-entry]] into a 3-year LLB program. Australian Law Schools include those at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], [[Australian Catholic University]], [[Australian National University]], [[La Trobe University]], [[Flinders University]], [[Bond University]], [[Macquarie Law School|Macquarie]], [[Monash University Faculty of Law|Monash]], [[Deakin University School of Law|Deakin]], [[UNSW Faculty of Law|UNSW]], [[University of Tasmania]], [[Adelaide Law School|Adelaide]], [[Victoria University, Australia|Victoria University]], [[Sydney Law School|Sydney]], [[Melbourne University Law School|Melbourne]], [[Queensland University of Technology]], the [[TC Beirne School of Law|University of Queensland]], the [[University of Western Australia]] and the [[University of Canberra]].

=== Canada ===
{{Main article|List of law schools in Canada}}

The professional law degree in Canada is the [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.) or [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.), for [[common law]] jurisdictions, and the [[Bachelor of Civil Law|Bachelor of Laws, Licentiate of Law or Bachelor of Civil Law]] for Quebec, a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdiction. Admittance to an LL.B. or J.D. program requires at least two years of [[undergraduate]] education, although, a completed undergraduate degree is usually required. In practice, the vast majority of those who are admitted have already earned at least an undergraduate [[Bachelor's degree|(bachelor's) degree]]. The change in academic [[nomenclature]] redesignating the common law degree as a J.D. rather than an LL.B., currently completed or under consideration at a number of Canadian schools, has not affected the level of instruction—because it is the same degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawiscool.com/2007/11/13/to-jd-or-not-to-jd/ To JD or Not JD — Law is Cool], November 13, 2007. Accessed 7 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawiscool.com/2008/02/26/alumni-consultation-next-for-westerns-jd-proposal/ Alumni Consultation Next for Western's JD Proposal — Law is Cool], February 26, 2008. Accessed 7 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Quebec civil law degrees and the transsystemic LL.B/B.C.L. program at [[McGill University Faculty of Law|McGill University]], students can be admitted after [[College education in Quebec|college]].

[[List of law schools in China]]

===Hong Kong===
{{Main article|Legal education in Hong Kong}}
In Hong Kong law can be studied as a four-year undergraduate degree [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB), a two-year postgraduate degree (Juris Doctor), or the [[Common Professional Examination]] conversion course for non-law graduates. One must then pass the one-year [[Postgraduate Certificate in Laws]] (PCLL) currently offered at the [[University of Hong Kong]] (HKU), [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] and [[City University of Hong Kong]], before starting vocational training: a year's [[pupillage]] for [[barrister]]s or a two-year [[training contract]] for [[solicitor]]s.

The move to a four-year LLB was recent and, in the case of HKU, was aimed at shifting some of the more theoretical aspects of the HKU PCLL into the LLB, leaving more room for practical instruction.

===India===
{{Main article|Legal education in India}}
{{See also|Autonomous law schools in India|Common Law Admission Test|List of law schools in India}}

The [[Bar Council of India]] prescribes and supervises standard of legal education in India. Law degrees in India are granted and conferred in terms of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080819185257/http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf Advocates Act, 1961], which is a law passed by the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] both on the aspect of legal education and also regulation of conduct of legal profession. Various regional universities or specialised national law universities offer Law graduate degrees through various law schools.

In India law can be studied, as LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws) or B.L. (Bachelor of Law), a three-year graduate degree after completion of [[Bachelor's degree]]. Alternatively after standard 12 one can join an integrated five-year law course which provides option to avail B.A. LL.B. or B.B.A. LLB. or B.Sc. LL.B. In India applied legal education for specific branches of law is also offered such as, Business law, Human resource and Labour laws, Property laws, Family laws, Human rights &amp; Legal awareness, Taxation law and many more.

=== Italy and France ===
Law in Italy and France is studied in a jurisprudence school which is an entity within a larger university. Legal education can be started immediately after obtained a Diploma. Italian and French law schools are affiliated with public universities, and are thus public institutions. As a consequence, law schools are required to admit anyone holding the baccalaureate. However, the failure rate is extremely high (up to 70%) during the first two years of the "licenza in diritto". There are no vast disparities in the quality of Southern European law schools. Many schools focus on their respective city and region.

The law school program is divided following the European standards for university studies ([[Bologna process]]):
* first a license of law program (''Licence de droit''): three-year period
* Then a Master of law program (''Master de droit''): two-year period
* Ph.D. in Law (''Doctorat en droit''): three-year period (often more).

The first year of the master program (M1) is specialized : public law, private law, business law, European and international law, etc.

The second year of the master of law program (M2) can be work-oriented or research oriented (the students write a substantial thesis and can apply to doctoral programs, e.g., a PhD in Law).

The second year is competitive (entry is based on the student's grades and overall score and on extracurricular activities) and generally more specialized (IP law, contract law, civil liberties, etc.).

Students must pass a specific examination to enter bar school (CRFPA, école du barreau). They must successfully finish the first year of a Master of law (M1 or maitrise de droit) to be able to attend.

If they succeed, then after 18 months (school, practical aspects, ethics and internship) they then take the CAPA exam and diploma(Certificat d'Aptitude à la Profession d'Avocat). Successful students also take the Oath in order to practice law.

=== Japan ===
The Japanese Ministry of Justice opened the [[University of Tokyo]] Faculty of Law in 1877 (changed to Imperial University in 1886). To matriculate to the University of Tokyo, students had to finish ten to fifteen years of compulsory education; acceptance was therefore available to only a small elite. The law program produced politically-dependable graduates to fill fast-track administrative positions in government, also known as high civil servants (koto bunkan), and to serve as judges and prosecutors.

Private law schools opened around 1880. These lacked the government funding given to the University of Tokyo, so the quality of education there lagged behind. Students only had to pass an examination to matriculate to private law schools, so many of them had not completed middle school. The private law schools produced a large portion of private attorneys because their graduates were often ineligible to apply for government positions.

The Imperial University Faculty of Law was given supervisory authority over many private law schools in 1887; by the 1920s, it promulgated a legal curriculum comprising six basic codes: Constitutional Law, Civil Law, Commercial Law, Civil Procedure, Criminal Law, and Criminal Procedure. The same basic structure survived in Japanese legal education to the end of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_01.1_miyazawa.pdf|title=Legal Education and the Reproduction of the Elite in Japan, 1 Asian-Pac. L. &amp; Pol'y J. 2|year=1999|publisher=Hawaii.edu|author=Setsuo Miyazawa|accessdate=2012-11-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629081700/http://www.hawaii.edu/aplpj/articles/APLPJ_01.1_miyazawa.pdf|archivedate=2011-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the implementation of the "law school system" in 2004, the legal education system was driven more by examinations than by formal schooling. The passage rate for the bar exam was historically around three percent, and nearly all those who sat for the exam took it several times. A number of specialized "cram schools" trained prospective lawyers for the exam, and these schools remain prevalent today. After passing the bar exam, prospective barristers were required to train for 16 months at the Legal Research and Training Institute of the [[Supreme Court of Japan]]. The training period has traditionally been devoted to litigation practice and virtually no training is given for other aspects of legal practice, e.g., contract drafting, [[legal research]]. During this period, the most "capable trainees" are "selected out" to become career judges; others may become prosecutors or private practitioners.

In 2004, the Japanese Diet passed a law allowing for the creation of graduate level law school {{nihongo|law schools|法科大学院|hōka daigakuin}} that offer a J.D., or Hōmu Hakushi (法務博士). The 2006 bar examination was first in Japanese history to require a law school degree as a prerequisite. In the past, although there has been no educational requirement, most of those who passed the examination had earned undergraduate degrees from "elite" Japanese universities such as the [[University of Tokyo]], [[Kyoto University]] or [[Hitotsubashi University]]. With this new law school system came a new bar exam, with a 40–50% passage rate which is capped by a numerical quota. Applicants are now limited to taking the exam three times in a five-year period. Despite the much higher bar passage rate with the new exam, due to the quotas, approximately half of Japanese law school graduates will never be admitted to practice. The new system also reduced the apprenticeship period at the Legal Research and Training Institute to one year.&lt;ref name="law.harvard" /&gt;

A number of other law-related professions exist in Japan, such as patent agents (''[[benrishi]]''), tax accountants (''[[zeirishi]]''), [[scrivener]]s, etc., entry to each of which is governed by a separate examination. Attorneys ("bengoshi"), being qualified to practice any law, can automatically be qualified as patent agents and tax accountants with no additional examination, but not vice versa.

=== Korea ===
{{Main article|Law school in Korea}}

Legal education in Korea is driven by examination. The profession of barristers, is highly regulated, and the pass rate for the bar exam is around five percent. Prospective attorneys who do pass the exam usually take it two or three times before passing it, and a number of specialized "private educational institutes" exist for prospective lawyers. After passing the bar exam, prospective barristers undergo a two-year training period at the [[Judicial Research and Training Institute]] of the [[Supreme Court of Korea]]. During this period, the most capable trainees are "selected out" to become career judges; others may become prosecutors or private practitioners.

In 2007, the Korean government passed a law allowing for the creation of three-year law schools (''법학전문대학원''). According to the new law, the old system of selecting lawyers by examination will be phased out by 2013 and the U.S.-style law schools will be the sole route to become a lawyer.&lt;ref name="law.harvard" /&gt;

In February 2008, the Ministry of Education of Korea selected 25 universities to open law schools. The total enrollment for all law schools is capped at 2,000, which is a source of contention between the powerful Korea Bar Association, and citizen groups and school administrators. There is an uproar among the schools which failed to get the government's approval and even among the schools that did get the approval, there is dissatisfaction due to an extremely low enrollment number. Several law schools are permitted to enroll 40 students per year, which is far below the financially sustainable number. Beginning in 2012, passage of the Lawyer Admission Test (which is distinct from the old bar exam) will be required for qualification to practice.

A number of other legal professions exist in Korea, such as patent attorneys (''변리사''), tax attorneys (''세무사''), [[solicitor]]s(''법무사''), etc., entry to each of which is governed by a separate examination.

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main article|Legal education in Malaysia}}
As a Commonwealth country, the Malaysian legal education system is rooted from the United Kingdom. Legal qualifications offered by the local law faculties require students to have a pre-university qualification such as the [[Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia|Malaysian Higher School Certificate]], [[A-Level]], [[International Baccalaureate]], Foundation Course or a Diploma. Generally, the law degree programmes in Malaysia consist of civil law subjects, but there are institutions such as The National University of Malaysia, [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] and [[Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin]] that include [[Sharia]] or Islamic law courses as requirements for admission and graduation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iium.edu.my/aikol/programmes-courses/undergraduate-programmes/bachelor-law-llb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fuha.unisza.edu.my/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=79&amp;Itemid=133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukm.my/fuu/programmes%20-%20llb.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203072652/http://www.ukm.my/fuu/programmes%20-%20llb.htm |archivedate=2015-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malaysian law graduates from universities in the UK, Australia or New Zealand are allowed to practice law in Malaysia. However, they are required to obtain a Certificate of Legal Practice in Laws of Malaysia.

=== Philippines ===
{{Main article|Legal education in the Philippines}}
{{See also|Philippine Bar Examination}}

Law degree programs are considered graduate programs in the Philippines. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a bachelor's degree, with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas.
Legal education in the Philippines is regulated and supervised by the LEGAL EDUCATION BOARD, a statutorily created independent Body chaired by a retired member of the Supreme Court or of the Court of Appeals.  Its first chairman is Justice Hilarion Aquino.  Sitting as members of the Board are a representative of the law professors, a representative of the law deans and a representative of the Commission on Higher Education.  The membership of a student representative has been subject to continuing debate and resistance on the part of law schools.
Graduation from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement for the Philippine Bar Examinations, administered by the Supreme Court during the month of September every year.

In order to be eligible to take the bar examinations, one must complete either of the two [[First Professional degree|professional degrees]]: The [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.) program or the Juris Doctor (J.D.) program. Advanced degrees are offered by some law schools, but are not requirements for admission to the practice of law in the Philippines. The degrees Master of Laws (LL.M.), Master of Legal Studies are available in only a handful of Philippine universities and colleges, among these San Beda College Graduate School of Law, the University of Santo Tomas and Ateneo de Manila University.  The Doctor of Civil Law degree (DCL) is offered only by the University of Santo Tomas and the Doctor of Juridical Science (JSD) degree is offered by the San Beda College Graduate School of Law.  Graduate programs in law are also regulated by the Legal Education Board

Legal education in the Philippines normally proceeds along the following route:
* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)
* Law school (usually 4 years)
* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a Philippine bar exam)
* Legal practice and mandatory continuing legal education

=== Russia and Ukraine ===
[[Law degree]] – jurist (often compared to an [[Master of Laws|LL.M.]], but in fact equivalent to the degree of Specialist specific to the Soviet educational system) is awarded in Russia and [[Ukraine]] after 5 years of study at a university. Jurist degree may also be awarded in a shorter period of time if a law student has already completed Bachelor or Specialist degree in another field of studies or has previously earned a basic law degree (comparable to Paralegal, an associate degree in U.S.) from a specialized law college. Bachelor jurist degree (equivalent to Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.)) may be earned concurrently with another bachelor's or master's degree in some universities (comparable to a double-major). Note that this fused, one-degree (Specialist) educational scheme has coexisted with the two-degree (bachelor's – master's) scheme since Russia and Ukraine launched their higher education reforms to bring the domestic educational systems in closer compliance with the [[Bologna accords]]. See also [[academic degree]]. The latest educational reforms created new system where a four-year law program is offered at the universities for earning bachelor's degree, and a five-year law program is offered for master's degree. The degree of Specialist is no longer awarded and is renamed into master's degree.

=== Serbia ===
{{See also|History of legal education in Serbia|University of Belgrade Faculty of Law}}

To become a lawyer in Serbia, students must graduate from an accredited faculty of law. Studies last for five years (ten semesters) in accordance to the [[Bologna process|Bologna Convention]]. To become a student of the faculty of law, a candidate must pass the admission test. Students are divided into full-time students and part-time students. The practical training for students is organized at courts of law, and local and international [[moot court]] competitions. A lawyer must pass the national bar examination to become an attorney, a judge, or a [[prosecutor]].

Since 1998, LL.B. programmes may be entered directly at the [[undergraduate]] level; at the same time, the LLB. continues to be offered [[postgraduate]] and may then be accelerated dependent on the [[bachelor's degree]]. The programme lasts between two and four years correspondingly&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.wits.ac.za/Academic/CLM/Law/DegreesAndCourses/LLB.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726092702/http://web.wits.ac.za/Academic/CLM/Law/DegreesAndCourses/LLB.htm |date=July 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (compare [[Legal education#Australia|Australia, above]]).  See [[Bachelor of Laws #South Africa]].

Although not formally required for specialised practice, further training, e.g. [[Master of Science in Taxation|in tax]], is usually via [[postgraduate diploma]]s or focused, coursework-based [[LL.M.]] programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llm-guide.com/south-africa |title=Master of Laws (LL.M.) Programs in South Africa |publisher=Llm Guide |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research degrees are the [[LL.M.]] and [[LL.D.]], or [[PhD]] depending on university. The Master's [[dissertation]] reflects an ability to conduct independent research, whereas the Doctoral [[thesis]] will, in addition, constitute an original contribution to the field of law in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unisa.ac.za/contents/faculties/law/docs/LLM_LLD_A5brochure_2010_v2.pdf |title=School of Law LLM and LLD Degrees |publisher=Unisa.ac.za |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A doctorate, generally, is required for positions in legal [[academia]]. See [[Master of Laws #South Africa]]; [[Doctor of Law #South Africa]].

Historically, the B.Proc. and B.Juris were the legal degrees offered at the undergraduate level. The four-year BProc qualified one to practice as an attorney, or become a prosecutor or [[magistrate]] in the [[South African Law#Court System in South Africa|lower courts]], but did not allow for admission as an advocate. The three-year B.Juris was the basic requirement for prosecutors and magistrates in the lower courts, but on its own, did not qualify one to practice as an attorney. Both offered admission to the LLB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labour.gov.za/downloads/documents/research-documents/Law_DoL_Report.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Law_DoL_Report.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For admission as an attorney, one serves "[[Articled clerk|articles]]" as a candidate attorney with a practicing attorney for two years, and then writes a "board exam" set by the relevant [http://www.lssa.org.za/Index.cfm?fuseaction=home.page&amp;PageID=6402073 provincial Law Society]. See [[Attorneys in South Africa]]. The length of articles may be reduced by attending a practical legal training course or performing [[community service]].

Attorneys may additionally qualify as [[Notary public|Notaries]] and [[Conveyancer]]s, via the Conveyancing and Notarial Practice Examinations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lssalead.org.za/upload/CONVEYANCING%20COURSE%20AND%20NOTARIAL%20PRACTICE%20COURSE%202012%20v7.pdf |title=Courses in Conveyancing and Notarial Practice |publisher=Lssalead.org.za |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; those with technical or scientific training may further qualify as patent attorneys – see [[Patent attorney #South Africa]].

The requirements to enter private practice as advocates (Junior Counsel) are to become members of a [http://www.sabar.co.za/members.html Bar Association] by undergoing a period of training ([[Pupillage|pupilage]]) for one year with a practicing Advocate, and to sit an admission examination. On the recommendation of the Bar Councils, an advocate "of proven experience and skill" with at least ten years experience, may be appointed by the President of South Africa as a [[Senior Counsel]] (SC; also referred to as a "silk").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabar.co.za/legal-career.html |title=A Career at the Bar in South Africa – The General Council of the Bar (GCB) |publisher=Sabar.co.za |date=1998-11-16 |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Advocates in South Africa]].

The Act regulating admission to practice law ("The Qualifications of Legal Practitioners Amendment Act of 1997") is being revised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skillsportal.co.za/learning/higher_education/090210-CHE-LLB-degree-investigated-law.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615033823/http://www.skillsportal.co.za/learning/higher_education/090210-CHE-LLB-degree-investigated-law.htm |date=June 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South American countries ===
{{Main article|Law in South America}}
The law of South America is one of the most unified in the world. All countries can be said to follow civil law systems, although recent developments in the [[law of Brazil]] suggest a move towards the ''[[stare decisis]]'' doctrine. Moreover, all countries have recently signed up to the [[Union of South American Nations]] agreement, which aims to establish a system of supra-national law along the lines of the [[European Union]].

=== Sri Lanka ===
{{main|Legal education in Sri Lanka}}
In order to practice law in Sri Lanka, a lawyer must be 'admitted and enrolled as an Attorney-at-Law of the [[Supreme Court of Sri Lanka|Supreme Court of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]]. To be admitted to the bar a law student must complete law exams held by the [[Sri Lanka Law College]] and undergo a six-month period of apprenticeship under a senior practicing lawyer. There are two routes taken by students:

# Those who have gained a law degree, an [[LL.B.]] (which is 3–4 years long in Sri Lankan State Universities of [[University of Colombo]], [[University of Jaffna]], [[Open University of Sri Lanka]] and [[University of Peradeniya]]) are given direct entry to undertake law exams at the Sri Lanka Law College.
# Those who don't hold a law degree, could gain entrance to the Sri Lanka Law College via a competitive entrance exam to study law and prepare for the law exams.

Both groups of students must undergo a period of apprenticeship under a senior practicing lawyer who has at least 8 years of practicing experience. To become a judge one must be admitted as an Attorney-at-Law.

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main article|Legal education in the United Kingdom}}
In England and Wales, law can be studied as an undergraduate degree or in a [[Graduate Diploma in Law]] where students complete the Common Professional Examination. After obtaining the degree which is necessary to complete certain vocational courses and to serve a period of on the job training before one is able to qualify to practice as a [[barrister]], [[legal executive]], or [[solicitor]]. [[Bar Professional Training Course]] is regarded as one of the hardest degrees and presently it is the most expensive law-related degree.

===United States===
[[File:WilliamandMaryLawSchoolStatue.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[William &amp; Mary School of Law]], established in 1779, is the oldest law school in the USA]]
{{Main article|Legal education in the United States|Law school in the United States}}
{{See also|Law School Admission Council}}

The education of lawyers in the United States is generally undertaken through a [[law school]] program, although in some states (such as California and Virginia) applicants who have not attended law school may qualify to take the bar exam.&lt;ref&gt; http://barexam.virginia.gov/reader/readerrules.html &lt;/ref&gt;

Legal education in the United States normally proceeds along the following route:
* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)
* Law school (usually 3 years)
* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a state's bar exam)
* Legal practice

In the United States,in most cases, the degree awarded by American law schools is the [[Doctor of Jurisprudence]] or [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.), a [[Doctoral]] degree, the pursuit of which students undertake only after having completed an undergraduate degree in some other field (usually a [[bachelor's degree]]). The law school program is considered to be a [[professional school]] program and upon graduation you receive the distinct title of Doctor (although most states strictly regulate the ability of attorneys to style themselves "doctor").

Research degrees that are awarded include the [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.), [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] degrees (J.S.D. or S.J.D.) and Doctor of Comparative Law (D.C.L.), are post-undergraduate and research and academic-based level degrees. In the U.S. the [[Legum Doctor]] (LL.D.) is only awarded as an honorary degree.

A number of law students apply for an optional [[Law clerk#United States|judicial clerkship]] (less than 10% end up in such position), to be taken after law school and before legal practice. Clerkships usually last one year with appellate courts, but trial level courts (including federal district court) are increasingly moving towards two-year clerkships.

Once a student has graduated from law school, he or she is expected to pursue [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] in order to practice. Requirements for membership in the [[bar association|bar]] vary across the United States. In almost every state, the only way to be admitted to the bar is to pass a (usually multi-day) written examination. Once admitted, most States require attorneys to must meet certain [[Continuing Legal Education]] (CLE) requirements.

Academic degrees for non-lawyers are available at the baccalaureate and master's level. A common baccalaureate level degree is a Bachelor of Science in Legal Studies (B.S.). Academic master's degrees in legal studies are available, such as the Master of Studies (M.S.), and the Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.). Such a degree is not required to enter a J.D. program.

Foreign lawyers seeking to practice in the U.S., who do not have a J.D., often seek to obtain a [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.) (or other degrees similar to the LL.M., such as the Juris Master (J.M.), Master of Comparative Law (M.C.L.) and Master of Jurisprudence (M.J.)).

For these animals, there is documented evidence of [[homosexual behavior in animals|homosexual]] behavior of one or more of the following kinds: [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], [[courtship]], [[affection]], [[pair bond]]ing, or [[parenting]], as noted in researcher and author [[Bruce Bagemihl]]'s 1999 book ''Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity''.

Bagemihl writes that the presence of [[same-sex sexual behavior]] was not "officially" observed on a large scale until the 1990s due to possible [[Observer-expectancy effect|observer bias]] caused by social attitudes towards [[LGBT]] people, making the homosexual theme [[taboo]].&lt;ref name="Two Hundred Years "&gt;Bagemihl (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1,500 Animal Species Practice"&gt;News-medical.net (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Bagemihl devotes three chapters; ''Two Hundred Years at Looking at Homosexual Wildlife'', ''Explaining (Away) Animal Homosexuality'' and ''Not For Breeding Only'' in his 1999 book ''Biological Exuberance'' to the "documentation of systematic [[prejudice]]s" where he notes "the ''present ignorance'' of [[biology]] lies precisely in its single-minded attempt to find reproductive (or other) 'explanations' for homosexuality, transgender, and [[procreate|non-procreative]] and alternative [[heterosexual]]ities."&lt;ref name="Not For Breeding Only "&gt;Bagemihl (1999) page 213&lt;/ref&gt; Petter Bøckman, academic adviser for the ''[[Against Nature?]]'' exhibit stated "[M]any researchers have described homosexuality as something altogether different from sex. They must realize that animals can have sex with who they will, when they will and without consideration to a researcher's [[Ethics (philosophy)|ethical]] [[principle]]s." Homosexual behavior is found amongst social [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s, particularly the sea mammals and the [[primates]].&lt;ref name="1,500 Animal Species Practice"/&gt;

[[Animal sexual behavior]] takes many different forms, even within the same [[species]] and the motivations for and implications of their behaviors have yet to be fully understood. Bagemihl's research shows that homosexual behavior, not necessarily [[sex]], has been documented in about 500 species as of 1999, ranging from [[primates]] to [[Acanthocephala|gut worms]].&lt;ref name="Two Hundred Years "/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biological Exuberance: Animal"&gt;Harrold (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homosexuality in animals]] is seen as controversial by [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] because it asserts the naturalness of [[Human sexuality|homosexuality in humans]], while others counter that it has no implications and is nonsensical to equate natural animal behaviors to [[morality]].&lt;ref name="The Animal Homosexuality Myth"&gt;Solimeo (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Defending A Higher Law"&gt;Solimeo (2004b)&lt;/ref&gt; Animal preference and motivation is always inferred from behavior. Thus homosexual behavior has been given a number of terms over the years. The correct usage of the term ''homosexual'' is that an animal ''exhibits homosexual behavior'', however this article conforms to the usage by modern research,&lt;ref&gt;Bagemihl (1999) pages 122-166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughgarden (2004) pp.13-183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vasey (1995) pages 173-204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sommer &amp; Vasey (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; applying the term ''homosexuality'' to all sexual behavior ([[copulation]], [[genital stimulation]], [[mating|mating games]] and sexual [[Display (zoology)|display behavior]]) between animals of the same sex.

[[Image:Cnemidophorus-ThreeSpecies.jpg|thumb|Three species of ''[[Aspidoscelis]]''.]]
The all-female [[Whiptail lizard]] species ''[[Aspidoscelis neomexicanus]]'' (center), which reproduces via [[parthenogenesis]], is shown flanked by two sexual species having males, ''[[Aspidoscelis inornatus|A. inornatus]]'' (left) and ''[[Aspidoscelis tigris|A. tigris]]'' (right). Research has shown that simulated mating behavior increases fertility for ''Aspidoscelis neomexicanus''. One female lies on top of another, playing the role of the male, the lizard that was on bottom has larger eggs, in most cases. The lizards switch off this role each mating season.&lt;ref&gt;LeVay, (19 September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Male [[homosexuality]] has been inferred in several species of [[dragonflies]]. A survey of damsel and dragonflies reveals characteristic [[cloacal]] pincher mating damage in 20–80 percent of the males, indicating a fairly high occurrence of sexual [[coupling]] between males.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkle (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Utzeri (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michigan Molecular Institute''' (MMI) ceased operations in 2015 after nearly 45 years of outstanding service in pursuit of applied research in polymer science and technology. 

== History ==
MMI officially opened its doors under the name Midland Macromolecular Institute in the fall of 1972, although the facility had been in operation for the previous year. The building had broken ground in the spring of 1970, and it, like many of Midland's buildings from that era, was designed by local architect [[Alden B. Dow]]. The institute hosted a three-day dedication beginning September 28, 1972 with opening ceremonies that featured more than 400 scientists from throughout the world, chamber music from the Cleveland Quartet, several presentations and public tours.&lt;ref&gt;"Scientific Institute Praised", The Saginaw News, 1972-09-29. Retrieved 2010-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The featured speakers for the ceremonies were Dr. [[Herman Francis Mark]], considered by many to be the father of macromolecular sciences, and Dr. [[Paul J. Flory]], who two years later would be awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. Two other speakers were prof. dr. Donald Lyman and prof. dr. [[Edgar Andrews]]. Other luminaries on hand included Dr. [[Melvin Calvin]], the 1961 winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry; Dr. [[Charles Overberger]], then the vice-president for research at the University of Michigan; and [[Herbert D. "Ted" Doan]], president of the Michigan Foundation for Advanced Research, which was MMI's primary financial backer in its early days. 

MMI's first director was Dr. H.G. Elias, who came to Midland from the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in Zurich. Beyond funding from MFAR, early financial supporters of MMI were the Herbert H. &amp; Grace A. Dow Foundation, The Rollin M. Gerstacker Foundation and the Charles J. Strosacker Foundation. In the institute's early days, Elias said MMI would be run much like a university department, although its founders expected MMI would advance macromolecular science knowledge in a way that universities could not.&lt;ref&gt;"Scientific Institute Praised", The Saginaw News, 1972-09-29. Retrieved 2010-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; One similarity: MMI opened its doors as a not-for-profit organization, which it remains today.

MMI's first 15 years of research of advanced composite materials and polymer technology contributed to Michigan's ability to entice plastics- and composite-related industries to build in the state, and its affiliation with Central Michigan University and Michigan Technological University allowed it to offer master's and doctorate degrees in related research fields.&lt;ref&gt;"Our View", The Midland Daily News, 1990-06-03. Retrieved 2009-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, MMI began to shift its focus toward creating technology that could be licensed for commercialization. 

Over the years, six men have led the institute as President and/or CEO, including Elias (1972–83); Dr. Robert E. Hefner (1985-85 and 1990–92); Dr. John Hoffman (1985–1990); Dr. James D. Allen (1992–1994); Dr. Robert M. Nowak (1994–2009); and Dr. James H. Plonka (2009–2015).

|}MMI's emphasis from the beginning on the education portion of its mission led to a steady stream of outside experts through the institute, including the visiting professor program, established in 1973 and renamed in 1981 as a living memorial to the late Dr. Turner Alfrey, Jr. Each year, a leading scientist is invited to teach a short course, visit sponsoring organizations and deliver additional research seminars, benefitting many people by providing a point of connection between local scientists and engineers with the world leaders of the polymer science field.&lt;ref&gt;"Carnegie Mellon professor to lecture at MMI in May", The Midland Daily News, 2004-04-18. Retrieved 2010-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
TAVP speakers from around the world have been invited to present the latest, most up-to-date information in their particular polymer expertise areas.  Typically, these courses were delivered in an intensive, one-week, daily lecture format. Visiting professors also spent additional time at MMI, participating in one-on-one and research group discussions at the Institute, and in collaborations and discussions with other nearby industrial and academic researchers.  They also prepared and delivered a set of on-site seminars for many of the sponsoring organizations that parallel and supplement the formal course lectures.  Financial co-sponsors of the Turner Alfrey Visiting Professor program included [[The Dow Chemical Company]], [[Dow Corning Corporation]], [[Michigan State University]], [[Central Michigan University]], [[Saginaw Valley State University]], the Mid-Michigan Section of the [[Society of Plastics Engineers]], and the Midland Section of the [[American Chemical Society]].

The list of Turner Alfrey Visiting Professors includes several [[Nobel Prize]] winners.

'''Municipal annexation''' is a process by which a municipality expands its boundaries into adjacent areas not already incorporated into the municipality. This has been a common response of cities to [[urbanization]] in neighboring areas. It may be done because the neighboring urban areas seek municipal services or because a city seeks control over its [[suburb]]s or neighboring unincorporated areas.

In the [[United States]], all local governments are considered "creatures of the state" according to [[John Forrest Dillon#Dillon's Rule|Dillon's Rule]], which resulted from the work of [[John Forrest Dillon]] on the law of [[municipal corporation]]s. Dillon's Rule implies, among other things, that the boundaries of any [[jurisdiction]] falling under state government can be modified by state government action. For this reason, examples of municipal annexation are distinct from [[annexation]]s involving [[sovereign state]]s.

==Unusual annexations==

===Crossing county lines: Atlanta ===
In 1909 the city of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], then located only in [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], annexed part of neighboring [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]], from which Fulton County had originally been divided. Because the original county borders retain legal significance, the expansion into two counties generated some problems, such as when police arrest suspects on charges set forth in Georgia [[U.S. state|state]] law and city police must determine to which county's jail they must be taken.

===Merging by referendum: New York===
Following referenda in 1874 and 1895, the [[City of Greater New York|City of New York]] annexed portions of southern [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and in 1898, after another referendum, the city annexed all of [[Brooklyn|Kings]], [[Staten Island|Richmond]], and most of [[Queens]] counties. The annexed portion of Westchester County is now [[The Bronx|Bronx]] county; the unannexed portion of Queens County is now Nassau County.  As a result, Westchester County does not currently include any portion of the City of New York and Queens County is entirely within the City of New York.

==Shoestring annexation==
[[Image:LA in LA County map.png|thumb|right|300 px|A map of [[Los Angeles County]] with the city of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in red, showing the Shoestring Strip annexation, which reaches south to the San Pedro area and the [[Port of Los Angeles]].]]

A "shoestring annexation" is a term used for an annexation by a [[city]], [[town]] or other [[municipality]] in which it acquires new territory that is contiguous to the existing territory but is only connected to it by a thin strip of land.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9vQTxyeb04EC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Shoestring+annexation&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U0HmVkonY3ZzHjCa3Bca9wN5w9cIg#PPA46,M1 Annexation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zxUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA363&amp;dq=Shoestring+annexation&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a A History of California and an Extended History of Los Angeles]&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called a "flagpole annexation" because the territory resembles a flagpole, in which the connection is the "pole" and the annexed territory the "flag".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.state.co.us/owenspress/11-06-01a.htm |title=Flagpole annexation in Colorado |access-date=2010-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020101213353/http://www.state.co.us/owenspress/11-06-01a.htm |archive-date=2002-01-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons===
In some states, municipalities are prohibited from annexing land not directly connected to their existing territory.  A shoestring or flagpole annexation allows the municipality to do so.

Such annexations are sometimes used when a municipality seeks to acquire [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] developed land, such as a newly built [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]] separated from it by undeveloped open space. They may also be used when a municipality desires to annex a commercial or industrial area without taking over intervening residential areas, so as to collect tax revenues from the businesses or industry without having to provide services (such as [[electricity]] and [[waste|garbage]] collection) to residents. Such uses of the technique are often criticized and derided as a form of [[gerrymandering]], and have in fact been used for the purpose of manipulating vote distribution among election precincts and districts.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

A related strategy is called strip annexation, which involves annexing a narrow strip that encloses a large block of unincorporated land. Strip annexation was widely used by the municipalities of the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]] during the 1970s to preemptively gain control of large areas of land before other municipalities, without having to annex more than a thin strip surrounding a large so-called [[county island]]. The strip protected the county island from being annexed by other municipalities, thus giving the strip-annexing municipality the ability to slowly annex portions of the county island over time. One such annexation by [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]] in 1974 spurred nearby [[Gilbert, Arizona|Gilbert]] to create the largest county island to date by annexing a strip no more than 200 feet wide that enclosed 51 square miles of unincorporated [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]]. The annexation was challenged in court and, although found legal, eventually led to legislation in 1980 outlawing strip annexation. Some municipalities rushed to annex before the law took effect, such as [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], which annexed a 10 foot wide strip enclosing an 86 square mile county island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scholarworks.umass.edu/econ_workingpaper/55/ |title= Border Wars: Tax Revenues, Annexation, and Urban Growth in Phoenix |last= Heim |first= Carol E. |publisher= University of Massachusetts Amherst |pages= 18–27, 54 |accessdate= 27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
[[Image:US-IL-Chicago.png|thumb|right|300 px|A map of the city of [[Chicago]] showing the connection into [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]] for O'Hare International Airport.]]
{{norefs|section|date = March 2018}}

===Port of LA===
The [[Port of Los Angeles]] together with the [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]], [[Wilmington, Los Angeles, California|Wilmington]] and [[Harbor City, Los Angeles, California|Harbor City]] neighborhoods of [[Los Angeles]], are connected to the main part of the city by what is called locally the "[[Harbor Gateway, Los Angeles, California|Shoestring Strip]]" between [[Figueroa Street]] and [[Vermont Avenue]] and between [[Western Avenue, Los Angeles, California|Western]] and [[Normandie Avenue|Normandie]] avenues to the south.

===O'Hare Airport===
[[O'Hare Airport]] is municipally connected to the city of [[Chicago]] via a narrow strip of land, approximately 200 feet wide, along Foster Avenue from the [[Des Plaines river]] to the airport. This land was annexed in the 1950s to assure the airport was contiguous with the city to keep it under city control.  The strip is bounded on the north by [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]] and the south by [[Schiller Park, Illinois|Schiller Park]].&lt;ref&gt;http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_ATTACH/41st.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allston-Brighton===
The [[Boston]] neighborhoods of [[Allston]] and [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]] were part of an independent town of Brighton before being annexed by Boston.  At the time [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] extended to the [[Charles River]] and separated Boston and Brighton.  As a result, a shoestring annexation was obtained by Boston from Brookline when Brighton joined Boston.  This was made necessary by [[Boston–Brookline annexation debate of 1873|Brookline's refusal to join Boston]] a year before Brighton's annexation.

===South San Diego===
[[South San Diego]], located next to the [[Mexico–United States border]], is physically separated from the rest of [[San Diego]] by the cities of [[National City, California|National City]] and [[Chula Vista]]. A narrow strip of land at the bottom of [[San Diego Bay]] connects these southern neighborhoods with the rest of the city.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] provides an overview of and topical guide to entertainment and the entertainment industry:

'''[[Entertainment]]''' is any activity which provides a diversion or permits people to [[amusement|amuse]] themselves in their [[leisure|leisure time]], and may also provide [[fun]], enjoyment, and laughter. People may create their own entertainment, such as when they spontaneously invent a  game; participate actively in an activity they find entertaining, such as when they play [[sport]] as a hobby; or consume an entertainment product passively, such as when they attend a performance.

The '''[[Show business|entertainment industry]]''' (informally known as '''show business''' or '''show biz''') is part of the [[tertiary sector of the economy]] and includes a large number of sub-industries devoted to [[entertainment]]. However, the term is often used in the [[mass media]] to describe the mass media companies that control the distribution and manufacture of mass media entertainment. In the popular parlance, the term ''show biz'' in particular connotes the commercially popular performing arts, especially [[musical theatre]], [[vaudeville]], [[comedy]], [[film]], and [[music]].  It applies to every aspect of entertainment including [[film|cinema]], [[television]], [[radio]], [[theatre]], and [[music]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2471">'''PUFF-PLUME''' is a model used to help predict how air pollution disperses in the atmosphere. It is a [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|Gaussian]] atmospheric transport chemical/radionuclide [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|dispersion model]] that includes [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|wet and dry deposition]], real-time input of meteorological observations and forecasts, dose estimates from inhalation and gamma shine (i.e., radiation), and [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|puff or continuous plume]] dispersion modes. It was first developed by the [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]] (PNNL) in the 1970s.

It is the primary model for emergency response use for atmospheric releases at the [[Savannah River Site]] of the [[United States Department of Energy]]. It is one of a suite of codes for [[accidental release source terms|atmospheric releases]] and is used primarily for first-cut results in emergency situations. (Other codes containing more detailed mathematical and physical models are available for use when a short response time is not the over-riding consideration.)

'''Piedmont College''' is a private, comprehensive, liberal arts institution located in [[Demorest, Georgia|Demorest]] and [[Athens, Georgia]], United States. Founded in 1897, Piedmont's Demorest campus includes 300 acres in a traditional residential-college setting located in the foothills of the northeast Georgia Blue Ridge mountains. The campus includes ten dormitories housing more than 600 students. Academic and athletic facilities are all state-of-the-art. Approximately 50 miles to the south, Piedmont's Athens campus is located in the heart of Georgia's Classic City. The Athens campus provides a variety of undergraduate and graduate programs designed for commuting students.

Piedmont College offers more than 50 undergraduate academic programs in the Schools of Arts &amp; Sciences, Business, Education, and Nursing &amp; Health Sciences. Students may earn Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), Bachelor of Science (BS), or Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degrees. Graduate programs include Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Arts (MA) and Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT), Education Specialist (EdS), and Doctor of Education (EdD).

Enrollment is approximately 2,361 students, and the student-faculty ratio is 10:1.{{cite web | url = http://www.piedmont.edu| title = Piedmont College |publisher = Piedmont College| accessdate = 2018-09-07}} While most students come from Georgia, the college attracts applicants from across the U.S. and around the world, creating a diverse academic community with a variety of religious and ethnic backgrounds.

==History==
{{Main|History of Piedmont College}}
The college opened as the J.S. Green Collegiate Institute&lt;ref name="js green college"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.piedmontnavigator.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=bf65c584-f102-4483-a9e0-e8d5168144ec | title = J.S.

The first president was Reverend Charles C. Spence. The American Mission Board of the New England Congregational Churches operated the college from 1901 to 1948  and changed the name to Piedmont College to represent the geographic region. In 1948, under president James Walter, the college became an independent institution, although it maintains an affiliation with the [[United Church of Christ]] (UCC) and the related [[National Association of Congregational Christian Churches]] (NACCC).&lt;ref name="centennial history"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lane |first=Mary Charlotte Ed.D |title=Centennial History of Piedmont College: 1897-1997 |publisher=Piedmont College |year=1997 |location=Demorest, Ga. |pages=1–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congregationalists took over the school from the [[Methodists]] in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="history2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lane |first=Mary Charlotte Ed.D |title=Piedmont College History 1897-1990 |publisher=Piedmont College |year=1993|location=Demorest, Ga.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s to the 1990s, Piedmont grew slowly and developed a reputation as a small college with high academic standards. The college graduated a large number of teachers who went on to distinguished careers in education across the state. In 1994 the college began to expand, adding schools for Business and Nursing &amp; Health Sciences to its existing programs in the Arts and Sciences and Education. The college also opened a campus in Athens, Georgia, and began offering off-campus graduate education courses across the state. The Demorest campus grew substantially with the addition of the Arrendale Library; Stewart Center for Mathematics, Science and Technology; Swanson Center for Communications and the Performing Arts, Mize Athletic Center, the Smith-Williams Art Studios, and in 2015 the Student Commons. The college also added five new dormitories and 48 apartment-style residences.

Today Piedmont is one of the most dynamic small colleges in the Southeast, known equally for its academic programs in education, business, nursing and health sciences, and the arts and sciences. As a member of the USA South Conference of the NCAA Division III, Piedmont competes in 17 men’s and women’s sports.

Piedmont has a history of more than 120 years of providing education to people from across the world. There have been eleven presidents of the college who have each helped Piedmont get to where it is now.

==Campuses==
Piedmont has two campuses, the original one in Demorest and the newer expansion in Athens. Piedmont's Demorest campus is located on roughly {{convert|300|acre|ha|1}} in [[Habersham County]]. The Athens campus is located on Prince Avenue near downtown Athens, on the site of the original Prince Avenue Baptist Church.

===Demorest===

The Demorest campus is primarily a residential campus, with ten [[dormitories]], including Getman-Babcock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thenortheastgeorgian.com/articles/2008/10/21/news/education/03education.txt|title=Piedmont plans 'Haunted Hotel'|date=2008-10-21|work=The Northeast Georgian|publisher=Community Newspapers Inc|accessdate=14 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Purcell, Wallace, Swanson, Johnson, Mayflower, New Bedford, Plymouth and Ipswich&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REsidence Life Home|url=http://piedmont.edu/pc/index.php/campus-life/resident-life|publisher=Piedmont College|accessdate=9/2/13}}&lt;/ref&gt; halls that together house about 600 students. The Piedmont Village (apartment-style living which opened in 2015) houses an additional 180 students.

The academic buildings include Daniel Hall, which houses the R.H. Daniel School of Nursing, the [[Humanities]] Department, and administrative offices. Stewart Hall houses the Science and Math Departments. The School of Education is located in the Arrendale Library. The Walker School of Business is located in Camp Hall, which is adjacent to the President’s Home. The Music department is located in the Center for Worship and Music, which includes classroom and performance space, as well as the Sewell Pipe Organ, a 3,675-pipe organ built by the Casavant Frères company of Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec.

The Art Department is located in the Smith-Williams Studios and adjacent Martens Hall. The Mason-Scharfenstein Museum of Art is located in downtown Demorest. It features a large permanent collection and hosts numerous exhibits throughout the year.

The Mass Communications and Theatre Departments are located in the Swanson Center for Performing Arts and Communication, a $14-million building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thenortheastgeorgian.com/articles/2009/10/30/news/business/01business.txt|title=Business resource seminar set Nov. 5 at Piedmont College|date=2009-10-29|work=The Northeast Georgian|publisher=Community Newspapers INC|accessdate=14 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which features two theaters and editing rooms for print, video and web productions.

[[File:Piedmont Pedestrian Bridge.JPG|thumb|250px|The pedestrian footbridge at Piedmont College connects to pieces of campus which are separated by Historic U.S. 441 Highway.]]
There are also a few general purpose buildings. Lane Hall, which faces the quad, is the remodeled old gym, which houses the Student Success Center. There is also the President's House, the Admissions building and the pedestrian bridge which crosses [[U.S. Route 441|Historic U.S. 441]].&lt;ref name="bridge1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Rob |title=Pedestrian Bridge Installation Rescheduled |work=The Northeast Georgian |publisher=Community Newspapers, Inc. |date=2008-08-04 |accessdate=2008-08-08 |url=http://www.thenortheastgeorgian.com/articles/2008/08/04/news/breaking_news/08breakingnews.txt }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge was assembled off-site and lowered into place by crane,&lt;ref name="bridge2"&gt;{{cite news |work=Access North Georgia |title=Demorest Bridge Installation Delayed |publisher=Jacobs Media |date=2008-07-30 |accessdate=2008-08-08 |url=http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail.php?n=211932&amp;c=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was modeled after the [[Vanderbilt University]] 21st Avenue Pedestrian Bridge. The installation of the bridge was a joint project of the Georgia Department of Transportation, Piedmont College and the city of Demorest.

Much of Piedmont's Demorest property is now [[wetlands]]. The wetlands area was once the site of Lake Demorest from 1890-2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thenortheastgeorgian.com/articles/2008/08/19/news/top_stories/04topstory.txt|title=Demorest lake drained for wetlands|last=Moore|first=Rob|date=2008-08-19|work=The Northeast Georgian|publisher=Community Newspapers Inc|accessdate=14 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lake was drained due to an irreparable dam, and the property was turned into a wetlands for students and faculty to use in their studies.

The heart of student life at Piedmont is the new Student Commons, which opened in the fall of 2015. The 58,000 square foot commons features the campus dining hall, fitness center (complete with a full-size basketball court with a walking track, a rock-climbing wall and a racquetball court), the official Piedmont College bookstore and a Starbucks cafe. The commons also is home to Student Services and has a state-of-the-art conference room and study rooms as well as staff offices.

Past themes for the drill have included a boiler explosion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenortheastgeorgian.com/articles/2008/04/22/news/top_stories/01topstory.txt |title=Drilling for disaster |date=22 April 2008 |work=The Northeast Georgian |publisher=Community Newspapers Inc |accessdate=18 June 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; a car accident at an outdoor concert,&lt;ref name="car accident"/&gt; a small plane crash and a gas tank explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.piedmont.edu/news/view/101 |title=Student nurses, HCMC respond to ‘disaster’ |last=Price|first=David|work= Institutional Advancement |publisher=Piedmont |date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
In addition to clubs and service organizations, Piedmont offers creative outlets for singers, musicians, and actors. All students can be part of the 100-voice Piedmont Chorale, which performs several concerts each year. The Piedmont Singers is a 50-member ensemble of selected students that performs on campus and each year tours in the U.S. or abroad. Performance groups also include the 10-member Cantabile a cappella singers, Piedmont Camerata chamber ensemble, Wind Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble, and String Ensemble.

Students interested in theatre may join the Piedmont College Theatre and the [[Alpha Psi Omega]] theatre honor society, which together perform a succession of plays each year ranging from Shakespeare to children's theatre.

Students interested in writing, photography, radio, television, and web production can also participate in a number of student-run organizations including the student newspaper and media channel, "The Roar" [formerly The Navigator]; the Yonahian yearbook, and student radio and TV stations.&lt;ref name="publications"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.piedmontnavigator.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=40defd1c-fc56-43a3-88f1-efa74fc97ff2 | title = Publishing Piedmont | last = Suda | first = Tim | work = The Navigator | date = 2008-01-14 | accessdate = 2008-05-11 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120216065656/http://www.piedmontnavigator.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=40defd1c-fc56-43a3-88f1-efa74fc97ff2 | archivedate = 2012-02-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magazine===
The first publication for the college was ''The Mountain Lantern'', which was named for a common firefly in the surrounding area. ''The Lantern'' started out as a monthly magazine in 1912.  In 1913, ''The Lantern'' became the college's yearbook. There would not be a magazine again until the spring semester of 2006, when a mass communications major published ''PC Magazine'' as her senior capstone project. In the fall of 2007, the magazine was renamed ''Pause'', which came out twice each semester; two print and two online. ''Pause'' has since been out of production.

===Yearbook===
''The Mountain Lantern'' lasted for only a short period until 1915. A yearbook was again issued in 1920, and the name was changed to the ''Yonahian''.  The odd-sounding name was derived from nearby [[Mount Yonah]]. Since 1920, the ''Yonahian'' has been published every year and provides a general record of students and faculty.

===Newspaper===
The first newspaper of Piedmont was ''The Hustler,'' which lasted from 1908 to 1909. There was no newspaper until 1917, when a bi-weekly newspaper named ''The Padded Hammer'' appeared in September. Later in 1917, after a vote on the name of the paper, it was changed to ''The Piedmont Owl''. The name was chosen as a reference to the concept of wisdom. This became the name of Piedmont's athletic teams as well, until 1921, when the Student Association adopted the name Mountain Lions, later shortened to Lions.&lt;ref name="thesis2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rountree |first=George Wilburn |title=Piedmont College: its history, resources, and programs |publisher=University of Georgia (Doctrinal Dissertation) |location=Athens, Ga. |year=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Piedmont Owl'' lasted for 67 years until the name was changed to match Piedmont's newer mascot. The paper became ''The Lion's Roar'' for 21 years until 2005, when it was changed to ''The Navigator''. The name is a reference to the ''[[Mayflower]]'' ship of the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]], honoring Piedmont's relationship to American [[Congregational church|Congregationalism]]. In the fall of 2015, all the college's media outlets were consolidated under the umbrella name of ''The Roar''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piedmontroar.com ''The Roar'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual life==
The Office of the Chaplain provides a variety of opportunities for religious expression among students. As a church-related college, Piedmont recognizes that faith and learning are frequently intertwined. In keeping with Congregationalism, the college acknowledges that each individual understands and relates to God in a unique way, and that the student body will always represent a breadth of religious backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences. Spiritual life at Piedmont exists to nurture and nourish the spiritual health and well-being of the students, faculty, and staff. The campus minister supports student-initiated programs, creates space for a variety of spiritual groups, collaborates with academic departments on spiritual programming, and continues to foster relationships with the school's church partners, the United Church of Christ (UCC) and the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches (NACCC), as well as local faith communities and social service agencies.

==Athletics==
[[Image:Piedmont Lions Basketball.jpg|thumb|left|Piedmont College is an NCAA Division-III member school, home to 17 intercollegiate athletic programs.]]
Piedmont College teams participate as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]]. The Lions are a member of the [[USA South Athletic Conference]]. Intercollegiate sports include men's and women's basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and track and field; women's volleyball and softball; and men's baseball. In 2016, Piedmont introduced men's and women's cycling. The college also offers a wide range of intramural sports competitions.

Piedmont was a charter member of the [[Great South Athletic Conference]] (GSAC) until the 2012-13 school year.

==Chronology==
* 1921: First poison laboratory within the Soviet secret services was established under the name "Special Office". It was headed by professor of medicine Ignatii Kazakov, according to [[Pavel Sudoplatov]].&lt;ref name="Birstein"&gt;Vadim J. Birstein. ''The Perversion Of Knowledge: The True Story of Soviet Science.'' Westview Press (2004) {{ISBN|0-8133-4280-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1926: The laboratory was under the supervision of [[Genrikh Yagoda]], a deputy of [[OGPU]] chairman [[Vyacheslav Menzhinsky]], who became [[NKVD]] chief in 1934 after Menzhinsky's death.
*February 20, 1939: It becomes ''Laboratory 1'' headed by [[Grigory Mairanovsky]]. The laboratory was under the direct supervision of NKVD director [[Lavrenty Beria]] and his deputy [[Vsevolod Merkulov]] from 1939 to March 1953.
*March 14, 1953: It was renamed to ''Laboratory 12''. V. Naumov is the newly appointed head. [[Lavrenty Beria]] and [[Vsevolod Merkulov]] were executed after Stalin's death. Immediate NKVD supervisor of the laboratory, [[Pavel Sudoplatov]], received a long term in prison.
*1978: Expanded into the ''Central Investigation Institute for Special Technology'' within the [[First Chief Directorate]] of the [[KGB]].
*Since 1991: Several laboratories of the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] (headquartered in [[Yasenevo District|Yasenevo]] near [[Moscow]]) are responsible for the "creation of biological and toxin weapons for clandestine operations in the West".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Kouzminov ''Biological Espionage: Special Operations of the Soviet and Russian Foreign Intelligence Services in the West'', Greenhill Books, 2006, {{ISBN|1-85367-646-2}} {{cite web |url=http://www.calitreview.com/Interviews/int_kouzminov_8013.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050425151231/http://www.calitreview.com/Interviews/int_kouzminov_8013.htm |archivedate=2005-04-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human experimentation==

Mairanovsky and his colleagues tested a number of deadly poisons on prisoners from the [[Gulag]]s ("[[enemies of the people]]"), including [[mustard gas]], [[ricin]], [[digitoxin]], [[curare]], cyanide, and many others.&lt;ref name="Meier"&gt;Andrew Meier. 2008. ''The Lost Spy: An American in Stalin's Secret Service'', W. W. Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the experiments was to find a tasteless, odourless chemical that could not be detected ''post-mortem''. Candidate poisons were given to the victims, with a meal or drink, as "medication".&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt;

Finally, a preparation with the desired properties called C-2 or K-2 (carbylamine choline chloride) was developed.&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Laurence, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DXiJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT43&amp;lpg=PT43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Murder Stories]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boris Volodarsky, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GFd-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The KGB's Poison Factory], page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; According to witness testimonies, the victim changed physically, became shorter, weakened quickly, became calm and silent, and died within fifteen minutes.&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt; Mairanovsky brought to the laboratory people of varied physical condition and ages in order to have a more complete picture about the action of each poison.

[[Pavel Sudoplatov]] and [[Nahum Eitingon]] approved special equipment (i.e., poisons) only if it had been tested on "humans", according to testimony of Mikhail Filimonov.&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt; [[Vsevolod Nikolayevich Merkulov|Vsevolod Merkulov]] said that these experiments were approved by NKVD chief [[Lavrenty Beria]].&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt; After his arrest, Beria himself testified on August 28, 1953, that "I gave orders to Mairanovsky to conduct experiments on people sentenced to the highest measure of punishment, but it was not my idea".&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt;

In addition to human experimentation, Mairanovsky personally executed people with poisons, under the supervision of Sudoplatov.&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grani"&gt;[http://grani.ru/Politics/World/Europe/Ukraine/m.81346.html History of Soviet poisonings (Russian)] by [[Boris Vadimovich Sokolov|Boris Sokolov]] grani.ru&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged victims==
* Russian writer [[Maksim Gorky]] and his son. During the [[Trial of the Twenty One]] in 1938, NKVD chief [[Genrikh Yagoda]] admitted that he poisoned to death Maksim Gorky and his son and unsuccessfully tried to poison future NKVD boss [[Nikolay Yezhov]]. The attempted poisoning of Yezhov was later officially dismissed as falsification, but [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] believed that the poisoning accusations were true. Yagoda was never officially [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] (recognized as an innocent victim of political repressions) by Soviet authorities.&lt;ref name="Birstein"/&gt;
* Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]]. Russian historians [[Anton Antonov-Ovseenko]] and [[Edvard Radzinsky]] believe that Stalin was poisoned by associates of NKVD chief [[Lavrentiy Beria]], based on the interviews of a former Stalin bodyguard and numerous circumstantial evidence.

{{Criminology and penology|schools}}

In [[criminology]], the '''Positivist School''' has attempted to find scientific objectivity for the measurement and quantification of criminal behavior. As the [[scientific method]] became the major paradigm in the search for knowledge, the [[Classical school (criminology)|Classical School]]'s [[social philosophy]] was replaced by the quest for scientific laws that would be discovered by experts. It is divided into Biological, Psychological and Social.

==Biological positivism==
If [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Theory of evolution]] was scientific as applied to animals, the same approach should be applied to "man" as an "animal".
===Physical characteristics===
Historically, [[medicine]] became interested in the problem of crime, producing studies of [[physiognomy]] (see [[Johann Kaspar Lavater]] and [[Franz Joseph Gall]]) and the science of [[phrenology]] which linked attributes of the mind to the shape of the [[Human brain|brain]] as reveal through the [[Human skull|skull]]. These theories were popular because they absolved [[society]] and any failures of its [[government]] of responsibility for criminal behavior.  The problem lay in the propensities of individual offenders who were biologically distinguishable from law-abiding [[citizen]]s. This theme was amplified by the [[Italian school of criminology|Italian School]] and through the writings of [[Cesare Lombroso]] (see ''L'Uomo Delinquente'', ''The Criminal Man'' and [[Anthropological criminology]]) which identified physical characteristics associated with [[Devolution (biology)|degeneracy]] demonstrating that criminals were [[atavism|atavistic]] throwbacks to an earlier evolutionary form. Charles Goring (1913) failed to corroborate the characteristics but did find criminals shorter, lighter and less intelligent, i.e. he found criminality to be "normal" rather than "pathological" (cf the work of [[Earnest Hooton|Hooton]] found evidence of biological inferiority). [[William Herbert Sheldon|William Sheldon]] identified three basic body or [[somatotype]]s (i.e. ''endomorphs, mesomorphs'', and ''ectomorphs''), and introduced a scale to measure where each individual was placed. He concluded that delinquents tended to mesomorphy. Modern research might link physical size and athleticism and aggression because physically stronger people have the capacity to use violence with less chance of being hurt in any retaliation. Otherwise, such early research is no longer considered valid. The development of [[genetics]] has produced another potential inherent cause of criminality, with [[chromosome]] and other genetic factors variously identified as significant to select heredity rather than environment as the cause of crime (''see: [[nature versus nurture]]''). However, the evidence from family, twin, and adoption studies shows no conclusive [[empirical evidence]] to prefer either cause.

===Intelligence===
There are a number of reputable studies that demonstrate a link between lower intelligence and criminality. But the evidence is equivocal because studies among the prison population simply test those criminals actually caught, which might be because they failed to plan the crimes properly or because they were unable to resist interrogation techniques and admitted their crimes. If their intelligence is poor, they are also less likely to be deterred.

===Other medical factors===
[[Testosterone]] and [[adrenaline]] have been associated with [[aggression]] and [[violence]], and the [[arousal]] and excited state associated with them. The excessive consumption of alcohol can lower blood sugar levels and lead to aggressiveness, and the use of chemicals in foods and drinks has been associated with hyper-activity and some criminal behaviour.

==Psychological positivism==
[[Sigmund Freud]] divided the personality into the [[Ego, super-ego, and id|id]], the primitive biological drives, the [[superego]], the internalised values, and the [[Ego, super-ego, and id|ego]], [[memory]], [[perception]], and [[cognition]]. He proposed that criminal behaviour is either the result of [[mental illness]] or a weak conscience. [[John Bowlby]] proposed an [[attachment theory]] in which maternal deprivation was a factor that might lead to delinquency. This has been discounted in favour of general privation ([[Michael Rutter]]: 1981) or "broken homes" (Glueck: 1950) in which absentee or uncaring parents tend to produce badly behaved children.

[[Hans Eysenck]] (1987) stated that, "... certain types of personality may be more prone to react with anti-social or criminal behaviour to environmental factors of one kind or another."  He proposed three dimensions of personality: [[introversion]]/[[extroversion]], neuroticism, and [[psychoticism]]. For these purposes, personality is the settled framework of reference within which a person addresses the current situation and decides how to behave. Some traits will be dominant at times and then in a balanced relationship to other traits, but each person's traits will be reasonably stable and predictable (see Marshall: 1990 and Seidman: 1994). Hence, once conditioned into a criminal lifestyle, the relevant personality traits are likely to persist until a countervailing conditioning force re-establishes normal social inhibitions. Some forms of criminal behavior such as sexual offences, have been medicalised with treatment offered alongside punishment.

==Social positivism==
{{Main|Social positivism}}
In general terms, positivism rejected the Classical Theory's reliance on free will and sought to identify positive causes that determined the propensity for criminal behaviour. Rather than biological or psychological causes, this branch of the School identifies "society" as the cause. Hence, [[environmental criminology]] and other sub-schools study the spatial distribution of crimes and offenders (see [[Adolphe Quetelet]], who discovered that crimes rates are relatively constant, and the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] which, under the leadership of [[Robert E. Park]], viewed the city as a form of superorganism, zoned  into areas engaged in a continuous process of invasion, dominance, and succession).  Meanwhile, [[Émile Durkheim]] identified society as a social phenomenon, external to individuals, with crime a normal part of a healthy society. Deviancy was nothing more than "boundary setting," pushing to determine the current limits of morality and acceptability.

'''PottersWheel''' is a [[MATLAB]] toolbox for mathematical modeling of time-dependent [[dynamical system]]s that can be expressed as [[chemical reaction network]]s or [[ordinary differential equations]] (ODEs).&lt;ref&gt;T. Maiwald and J. Timmer (2008) "Dynamical Modeling and Multi-Experiment Fitting with PottersWheel", ''Bioinformatics'' 24(18):2037–2043&lt;/ref&gt; It allows the automatic calibration of model parameters by fitting the model to experimental measurements. CPU-intensive functions are written or – in case of model dependent functions – dynamically generated in C. Modeling can be done interactively using graphical user interfaces or based on MATLAB scripts using the PottersWheel function library. The software is intended to support the work of a mathematical modeler as a real [[potter's wheel]] eases the modeling of pottery.

== Seven modeling phases ==

The basic use of PottersWheel covers seven phases from model creation to the prediction of new
experiments.

=== Model creation ===

[[File:Formalization-of-Jak-Stat-Pathway.png]]

The dynamical system is formalized into a set of reactions or differential equations using a visual model designer or a text editor. The model is stored as a MATLAB *.m ASCII file. Modifications can therefore be tracked using a version control system like [[subversion]] or [[Git (software)|git]]. Model import and export is supported for [[SBML]]. Custom import-templates may be used to import custom model structures. [[Rule-based modeling]] is also supported, where a pattern represents a set of automatically generated reactions.

Example for a simple model definition file for a reaction network A → B → C → A with observed species A and C:

&lt;source lang=matlab&gt;
function m = getModel();

% Starting with an empty model
m = pwGetEmtptyModel();

% Adding reactions
m = pwAddR(m, 'A', 'B');
m = pwAddR(m, 'B', 'C');
m = pwAddR(m, 'C', 'A');

% Adding observables
m = pwAddY(m, 'A');
m = pwAddY(m, 'C');
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Data import ===

External data saved in *.xls or *.txt files can be added to a model creating a ''model-data-couple''. A mapping dialog allows to connect data column names to observed species names. Meta information in the data files comprise information about the experimental setting. Measurement errors are either stored in the data files, will be calculated using an error model, or are estimated automatically.

=== Parameter calibration ===

To fit a model to one or more data sets, the corresponding model-data-couples are combined into a ''fitting-assembly''. Parameters like initial values, rate constants, and scaling factors can be fitted in an experiment-wise or global fashion. The user may select from several numerical integrators, optimization algorithms, and calibration strategies like fitting in normal or logarithmic parameter space.

=== Interpretation of the goodness-of-fit ===

[[File:Fitting-data-with-PottersWheel.png]]

The quality of a fit is characterized by its ''chi-squared'' value.  As a rule of thumb, for
''N'' fitted data points and ''p'' calibrated parameters, the chi-squared value should have a similar value
as ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'' or at least&amp;nbsp;''N''. Statistically, this is expressed using a [[chi-squared test]] resulting in a [[p-value]] above a significance threshold of e.g.&amp;nbsp;0.05. For lower p-values, the model is

* either not able to explain the data and has to be refined,
* the standard deviation of the data points is actually larger than specified,
* or the used fitting strategy was not successful and the fit was trapped in a local minimum.

Apart from further chi-squared based characteristics like [[Akaike information criterion|AIC]] and [[Bayesian information criterion|BIC]], data-model-residual analyses exist, e.g. to investigate whether the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] follow a [[Gaussian distribution]]. Finally, parameter [[confidence intervals]] may be estimated using either the [[Fisher information matrix]] approximation or based on the [[profile-likelihood function]], if parameters are not unambiguously identifiable.

If the fit is not acceptable, the model has to be refined and the procedure continues with step 2. Else, the dynamic model properties can be examined and predictions calculated.

=== Model refinement ===

If the model structure is not able to explain the experimental measurements, a set of physiologically reasonable alternative models should be created. In order to avoid redundant model paragraphs and copy-and-paste errors, this can be done using a common core-model which is the same for all variants.  Then, ''daughter''-models are created and fitted to the data, preferably using batch processing strategies based on MATLAB scripts. As a starting point to envision suitable model variants, the PottersWheel ''equalizer'' may be used to understand the dynamic behavior of the original system.

=== Model analysis and prediction ===

A mathematical model may serve to display the concentration time-profile of unobserved species, to determine sensitive parameters representing potential targets within a clinical setting, or to calculate model characteristics like the half-life of a species.

Each analysis step may be stored into a modeling report, which may be exported as a Latex-based PDF.

=== Experimental design ===

An experimental setting corresponds to specific characteristics of ''driving input functions'' and
initial concentrations. In a signal transduction pathway model the concentration of a ligand
like EGF may be controlled experimentally.  The driving input designer allows investigating the effect of a continuous, ramp, or pulse stimulation in combination with varying initial concentrations using the equalizer.  In order to discriminate competing model hypotheses, the designed experiment should have as different observable time-profiles as possible.

== Parameter identifiability ==

Many dynamical systems can only be observed partially, i.e. not all system species are accessible experimentally. For biological applications the amount and quality of experimental data is often limited. In this setting parameters can be structurally or practically non-identifiable. Then, parameters may compensate each other and fitted parameter values strongly depend on initial guesses. In PottersWheel non-identifiability can be detected using the [[Profile Likelihood Approach]].&lt;ref&gt;''Structural and practical identifiability analysis of partially observed dynamical models by exploiting the profile likelihood'', A. Raue, C. Kreutz, T. Maiwald, J. Bachmann, M. Schilling, U. Klingmüller and J. Timmer, Bioinformatics 2009
&lt;/ref&gt; For characterizing functional relationships between the non-identifiable parameters PottersWheel applies random and systematic fit sequences.&lt;ref&gt;''Data-based identifiability analysis of non-linear dynamical models'', S. Hengl, C. Kreutz, J. Timmer and T. Maiwald, Bioinformatics 2007 23(19):2612–2618&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''private defense agency''' ('''PDA''') is an enterprise which would provide personal protection and [[military|military defense]] services to individuals who would voluntarily contract for its services. PDAs are advocated in [[anarcho-capitalism]] and market-based forms of [[social anarchism]], such as [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

A PDA is distinguished from a [[Private military company|private contractor]] of the state which is [[Subsidy|subsidized]] financially through [[taxation]] or legally through [[monopoly]] and [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity]], and relies on [[conscription]] and other involuntary support. Instead, such agencies would be voluntarily financed primarily by competing [[insurance]] and [[security]] companies, which are penalized for losses and damages, and have a financial incentive to minimize waste and maximize quality of service.

==Theory==
As proponents of [[free-market anarchism]],
[[Benjamin Tucker]]&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin,''The Relation of the State to the Individual'', 1890&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tucker |first=Benjamin |title=Liberty and Taxation |journal=[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gustave de Molinari]] first explicitly proposed for-profit private defense agencies.
The concept later was advanced and expanded upon by [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] who consider the state to be illegitimate, and therefore believe defense is something that should be provided or determined privately by individuals and firms competing in a free market. The [[Mises Institute]] published a book of essays entitled ''[[The Myth of National Defense: Essays on the Theory and History of Security Production]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Mises Review (Vol. 10, No. 1; Spring 2004) A summary is given in a review by David Gordon [https://www.mises.org/misesreview_detail.asp?control=247&amp;sortorder=issue].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray N. Rothbard]] in ''[[For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto]]'' and [[David D. Friedman]] in ''[[The Machinery of Freedom]]'' expand substantially on the idea. Both hold that a PDA would be part of a [[privatization|privatized]] system of [[law]], [[police]], [[court]]s, [[insurance companies]] and [[arbitration]] agencies who are responsible for preventing and dealing with aggression. In this environment, [[victimless crime]]s and "crimes against the state" would be rendered [[Mootness|moot]], and the legal realm would be limited to [[contract]]ual disputes and [[tort]] damages, as from [[assault]], [[burglary]], [[pollution]], and all other forms of aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard133.html |title=Society without a State |journal=[[The Libertarian Forum]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |date=January 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Friedman, [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter_29.html Police, Courts, and Laws---on the Market], [http://daviddfriedman.com David Friedman home page].&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is similar to [[Polycentric law]]. Within [[economics]], discussion of the concept largely has been confined to the [[Austrian School]], as in [[Hans Hoppe]]'s article "The Private Production of Defense" published by the [[Mises Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Hans |last=Hoppe |url=https://www.mises.org/journals/jls/14_1/14_1_2.pdf |journal=[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]] |format=[[PDF]] | title=The Private Production of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These authors emphasize that PDAs have different motives from existing [[Statism|statist]] defense agencies. Their survival depends on quality of service leading to a wide customer base, rather than the ability to extract funds via the force of law, as is true of [[Sovereign state|states]]. Customers and markets would thus dictate that PDAs minimize offensive tendencies and [[Militarism|militarization]] in favor of a pure defense. Anarcho-capitalists believe such privatization and [[decentralization]] of defense would eliminate the credibility of, and popular support for, the state.

As a private firm offering individually determined defense, the PDA provides a model for how an entirely private defense would work in a free market. [[John Frederic Kosanke]] argues that the need for large-scale defense is minimized in direct inverse proportion to the extent of domestic control by the state. Since the greater number of [[proprietor]]s makes [[Surrender (military)|surrender]] more costly to an aggressor than a relatively authoritarian region, [[vulnerability]] to attack is less likely. Furthermore, since individuals minding their own business pose little threat to neighboring regions, official or [[Ideology|ideological]] justification by those neighbors for attacking them is also proportionately diminished.&lt;ref&gt;John Frederic Kosanke, [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/johnfkosanke/Civilization101.html%23biv&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:56:26 "Civilization 101 - Elements of Security"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lack of monopoly power===
Hoppe points out that there is a contradiction in the beliefs of most philosophers and economists in reference to national defense. They generally hold that any [[monopoly]] is "bad" for consumers because, shielded from potential new entrants into his area of production, the price of his product X will be higher and its quality lower than otherwise. Yet they simultaneously hold that security must be undertaken by the government, which is a territorial monopoly of law and order (the ultimate decision maker and enforcer). Hoppe holds that the two propositions are clearly incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|chapter=Introduction|pages=3–4|author=Hoppe, Hans-Hermann|isbn=0-945466-37-4|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay ''The Production of Security'', Molinari concluded:&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/web/2716 The Production of Security&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|If there is one well-established truth in political economy, it is this: That in all cases, for all commodities that serve to provide for the tangible or intangible needs of the consumer, it is in the consumer's best interest that labor and trade remain free, because the freedom of labor and of trade have as their necessary and permanent result the maximum reduction of price. And this: That the interests of the consumer of any commodity whatsoever should always prevail over the interests of the producer. Now in pursuing these principles, one arrives at this rigorous conclusion: That the production of security should, in the interests of the consumers of this intangible commodity, remain subject to the law of free competition. Whence it follows: That no government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or to require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity.}}
Tyler Cowen, however, argues that allowing private defense agencies would not necessarily prevent a monopoly on defense services, by positing that a cooperating network of such firms could use aggressive force to enforce the [[cartel]]'s market domination. Noting that advocates of PDAs typically argue that abuses would be prevented by the presence of rival agencies acting under the authority of rulings made by arbitrators empowered by inter-agency [[arbitration agreement]]s, Cowen opines, "The adjudication network is stable only if it can use force to put down outlaw agencies that do not accept its higher-order arbitration decisions. Such a network could also use force to put down firms that do not adhere to the collusive agreement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Rejoinder to David Friedman on the Economics of Anarchy|author=Cowen, Tyler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anarcho-capitalist]]s argue that competing defense providers would concentrate on comparatively lower-cost defense and security technology rather than relatively costly offensive weaponry, in order to maintain lower premiums and service charges. A company's offensive capabilities would also be readily exposed by such an aggressor's competitors. State-subsidized militaries, in contrast, are granted a distinct offensive advantage, resulting in a proportionately greater tendency toward monopolization.

===Aggression and abuses by private defense agencies===
[[Randall G. Holcombe]] argues that "Firms might prey on their competitors' customers, as competing mafia groups do, to show those customers that their current protective firm is not doing the job and thus to induce them to switch protection firms. This action seems to be a profit-maximizing strategy; hence, protection firms that do not prey on noncustomers may not survive." Holcombe states that [[mafia]]s offers protection for a fee, but it also uses its resources for predation; and thus profit-maximizing firms could be expected to employ them in the dual roles of protection and predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Government: Unnecessary but Inevitable|author=Holcombe, Randall G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Leeson]] and [[Edward Stringham]] rebut this argument by claiming that unless the firm were overwhelmingly more powerful than its prey, it could incur substantial costs and risks in attempting to extract wealth by force. They argue that the potential for even a small state to inflict losses on a larger state explains why violent confrontations between states are less common than between individuals in [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]]; in other words, it is not the size of the group in question that matters, since in either case being the aggressor is likely to bring about undesirable risks and diminution of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is Government Inevitable? Comment on Holcombe's Analysis|author1=Leeson, Peter  |author2=Stringham, Edward P  |lastauthoramp=yes |ssrn=1674461 |journal=[[Independent Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Market for Liberty]]'', Linda and Morris Tannehill note that a private defense agency would be unlikely to engage in aggression, as it would not only become a target of retaliatory force, but would become the subject of severe business ostracism. Honest and productive individuals would dissociate themselves from it, fearing that it might use its aggressive force against them in the event of a dispute; or that they might become accidental casualties when retaliatory force is used by one of its other victims; or that their own reputation would suffer due to their ties to it. Moreover, the private defense agency's reputation would suffer and it would be regarded as a poor credit and insurance risk, the latter due to the high risk of claims resulting from its involvement in aggression. The employees and leaders of such an agency as well could face personal civil liability for their involvement, and the agency would not be shielded by [[sovereign immunity]]. High-quality employees would presumably be less willing to be involved with such an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|pages=109–111|chapter=Warring Defense Agencies and Organized Crime|author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris|isbn=0-930073-08-8|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also argue that a defense company would be less likely to abuse its power and impose tyranny, noting that it "couldn't extract taxes from them, as a government does...A market relationship is a free relationship, and if a customer doesn't like a company's service or mistrusts its goals, he is free to take his business elsewhere, or to start his own competitive company, or to do without the service and just provide from himself...The objection that a tyrant might take over is actually a devastating argument against government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|chapter=Warring Defense Agencies and Organized Crime|author=Tannehill, Linda and Morris|isbn=0-930073-08-8|page=115|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothbard makes a similar point, noting, "Of course, some of the private defense agencies will become criminal, just as some people become criminal now. But the point is that in a stateless society there would be no regular, ''legalized'' channel for crime and aggression, no government apparatus the control of which provides a secure monopoly for invasion of person and property...To create such an instrument ''de novo'' is very difficult, and, indeed, almost impossible; historically, it took State rulers centuries to create a functioning State apparatus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Economy and State with Power and Market|author=Rothbard, Murray N.|isbn=0-945466-30-7|page=1054|year=2004|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued, "If Defense Agency A instead of invading a business decides to invade a more worthwhile target such as a gold warehouse they are left with a much more complicated problem. The gold warehouse is owned by an entrepreneur who has his own defense agency and the gold in the warehouse also have owners that have hired their own respective defense agencies. In essence, Defense Agency A will have to deal with the wrath of the warehouse owner, the warehouse owner's defense agency and the defense agencies of all the owners of the gold in that warehouse."&lt;ref name=Villacampa&gt;{{Cite journal|title=In a State of Anarchy|author=Villacampa, Alexander|publisher=Grove City College|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert P. Murphy opines that given the privatization of other services in an anarcho-capitalist society, "We must consider that in such an environment, the law-abiding majority would have all sorts of mechanisms at their disposal, beyond physical confrontation. Once private judges had ruled against a particular rogue agency, the private banks could freeze its assets (up to the amount of fines levied by the arbitrators). In addition, the private utility companies could shut down electricity and water to the agency’s headquarters, in accordance with standard provisions in their contracts."&lt;ref&gt;https://mises.org/story/1855&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that customers will be able to hire a competing firm to protect them against a rogue defense agency has been critiqued by Jonathan Bond's essay, ''The Price of Private Law'', which argues, "If two defense firms are engaged in a truly ‘local’ dispute, and the remaining firms are not convinced that either their own interests will be affected or that systemic destabilization will result if the conflict continues, then the costs of intervening and ending the inter-agency war could presumably bar such third parties from stepping into the crossfire." Bond also argues that some firms may not be concerned with the risk of alienating other clients, because their clientele may consist of a small number of, or even only one, enormous multinational corporations. Bond further argues that some PDAs may reduce their risk of retaliation by carrying out anonymous sabotage or terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Price of Private Law|author=Bond, Jonathan C.|date=11 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Villacampa notes that consumers with large amounts of wealth would likely pay more for private defense, stating "There is no reason for someone void of valuable assets to hire a defense agency that is meant to protect assets other than oneself; but, in an involuntary government payment is demanded for the services regardless of whether they are use or not." He argues an alliance of aggressor private defense agencies would likely be unprofitable: "Chances are high that a mobilization of a mass army of defense agencies will cost more to each individual than his gain from gold, land, and such divided equally amongst themselves. If the region being attacked has large stashes of valuable goods, they will most likely have very effective defense agencies (stronger defense agencies for more valuable assets are logical) and thus the fight against the invading defense agencies will inflict more cost upon the invaders."&lt;ref name=Villacampa/&gt;

===Financing of private defense agencies===
Defense is often viewed as an archetypical [[public good]]{{spaced ndash}}i.e., a product that can only be provided by government because of its [[non-excludability]] and [[non-rivalrous consumption]]. Specifically, the [[free rider problem]], in which people refuse to pay for defense but instead rely on their neighbors to pay for defending the community, is said to make it inevitable that it be financed by taxes if an equitable allocation of costs is to be achieved. According to anarcho-capitalist theorists, there are many ways by which this problem can be overcome or rendered irrelevant. Rothbard's solution was to simply say "Who cares?" when it comes to the issue of free riders. He points out that free riders are commonplace in other aspects of our economy, asking hypothetically, "Are we to be critical because more than one person benefits from someone's actions?...In short, am I to be taxed for enjoying the view of my neighbor's well-kept garden?" He notes that we are all free riders on the past, as we would be living in a primitive society if it were not for the efforts of our ancestors; and we are free riders on the present, because we benefit from the continuing investment of our fellow men and from their specialized skills on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Economy and State|author=Rothbard, Murray N.|isbn=0-945466-30-7|page=1037|year=2004|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph R. Stromberg notes that the [[American Revolution]] occurred despite the fact that some individuals might have been free riders who benefited from it without funding it; he opines that successful defense of freedom often relies not on precise allocations of cost, but on "nationalism, religion, the desire for freedom, hatred of the enemy, social pressure to do the right thing, and so on," some of which might represent "[[enlightened self interest]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|pages=237–238|chapter=Mercenaries, Militias, Guerrillas, and the Defense of Minimal States and Free Societies|author=Stromberg, Joseph R.|isbn=0-945466-37-4|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linda and Morris Tannehill]] believe that big businesses will tend to pay the bulk of the defense costs (since they stand to lose the most in the event of an attack); they would then pass on the costs to their customers, and so the costs of defense would be spread out among the whole population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|chapter=Foreign Aggression|author=Tannehill, Morris and Linda|isbn=0-930073-08-8|page=131|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; A landowner seeking to establish a community may sell or lease the land with provisions written into the deed or lease agreement, requiring the new owner or tenant to pay for defense on a permanent basis; this same technique has already been in some neighborhoods to ensure that residents pay for private streets shared in common by all of them. As is true for homeowners today, everyone would be responsible for buying or otherwise being covered by aggression insurance in order to protect themselves against catastrophic loss from foreign attack; in the event of an invasion, a claim would be filed with right of [[subrogation]], and the insurer would hire a private defense company to collect from the aggressor. An argument against this method of funding is that other aggression insurers who didn't pay for defense would still benefit from the reduced risk of attack on their customers in the same area, in effect becoming free riders who could drive the "altruistic" insurer out of business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.no-treason.com/archives/2001/06/ No Treason » 2001 » June&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the private defense agency's activity need not be limited to defensive and retaliatory measures funded by the insurer; It could also go after the aggressor in an effort to obtain restitution (including reasonable [[collection cost]]s), perhaps through ransom or capture of enemy assets, as [[privateer]]s did in the 18th and 19th centuries under [[Letter of marque|letters of marque and reprisal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|author=Sechrest, Larry J. |authorlink=Larry J. Sechrest |chapter=Privateering and National Defense: Naval Warfare for Private Profit|isbn=0-945466-37-4|page=258|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prisoners of war also used to have [[shadow price]]s (ransoms) which were a source of income for victorious forces; this represents another potential alternative to taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|author=Radnitzky, Gerard|chapter=Is Democracy More Peaceful than Other Forms of Government?|isbn=0-945466-37-4|page=147|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes arguments are made for voluntary funding of defense by way of attacking taxation. Anarcho-capitalists often argue, for instance, that the argument that taxation is needed to fund protection of liberty and property from aggression is a contradiction, because taxation itself requires aggression in order to be enforced. Another argument comes from the fact that, unlike voluntary transactions, no [[demonstrated preference]] has been made by the taxpayer; so there is no objective way of showing that he is receiving a service he wants and needs, at a price that is fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of National Defense|author=Block, Walter|chapter=National Defense and the Theory of Externalities, Public Goods, and Clubs|isbn=0-945466-37-4|page=310|year=2003|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Inst.|location=Auburn, Ala.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical examples of widespread use==

===Ancient Europe===
Ancient city-states in Greece and Rome depended on [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|liturgy]]{{spaced ndash}}contributions made by rich citizens for specific purposes{{spaced ndash}}for defense. A liturgy might be used, for instance, to fund the manning of a warship. Although a certain amount was assessed by magistrates, some citizens paid more than required in order to obtain popularity, influence, and sympathy among jurors in the event they were taken to court. During the [[Second Punic War]], [[Quintus Maximus Fabius Verrucosus]] used his personal resources to pay for the release of some Roman prisoners. When the son of [[Scipio Africanus]], who at the time was acting as de facto commander-in chief, was captured during the war against [[Antiochus III the Great]] in 190 BC, he came up with ransom himself. As Rome grew wealthier, greater use was made of private money and/or private armed forces, consisting of relatives and clients, to accomplish public objectives. Between 73 and 71 BC, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]] and [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]] used their own resources to suppress the armies of [[Spartacus]] in the [[Third Servile War]]. [[Julius Caesar]] made his fortune by vanquishing pirates in the Mediterranean and then by [[Gallic Wars|conquering]] [[Gaul]]. The emergence of the modern state caused the members of the upper classes to be disarmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise and Decline of the State|author=van Creveld, Martin|pages=32–33, 207|isbn=0-521-65629-X|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Iceland===
[[File:Law speaker.jpg|right|thumb|19th century interpretation of the [[Althing]] in the [[Icelandic Commonwealth]], which authors such as [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]] and [[Roderick Long]] believe to have some features of anarcho-capitalist society.]]
According to [[David D. Friedman|David Friedman]], "[[Icelandic Commonwealth|Medieval Icelandic institutions]] have several peculiar and interesting characteristics; they might almost have been invented by a mad economist to test the lengths to which market systems could supplant government in its most fundamental functions."&lt;ref name="Friedman-79"&gt;Friedman, David D. (1979) [http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Iceland/Iceland.html Private Creation and Enforcement of Law: A Historical Case]. Retrieved 12 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; While not directly labeling it anarcho-capitalist, he argues that the Icelandic Commonwealth between 930 and 1262 had "some features" of an anarcho-capitalist society&amp;nbsp;– while there was a single legal system, enforcement of law was entirely private and highly capitalist; and so provides some evidence of how such a society would function.  "Even where the Icelandic legal system recognized an essentially "public" offense, it dealt with it by giving some individual (in some cases chosen by lot from those affected) the right to pursue the case and collect the resulting fine, thus fitting it into an essentially private system."&lt;ref name="Friedman-79"/&gt;

===American Old West===
According to the research of [[Terry L. Anderson]] and P. J. Hill, the [[Old West]] in the United States in the period of 1830 to 1900 was similar to anarcho-capitalism in that "private agencies provided the necessary basis for an orderly society in which property was protected and conflicts were resolved," and that the common popular perception that the Old West was chaotic with little respect for property rights is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Terry L. and Hill, P. J. [http://invisiblemolotov.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/wild-west3.pdf An American Experiment in Anarcho-Capitalism: The Not So Wild, Wild West], The Journal of Libertarian Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[squatter]]s had no claim to western lands under federal law, extra-legal organizations formed to fill the void. Benson explains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=To Serve and Protect: Privatization and Community in Criminal Justice|page=101|chapter=Private Justice in America|isbn=978-0-8147-1327-3|author=Benson, Bruce L.|year=1998|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The [[land club]]s and claim associations each adopted their own written contract setting out the laws that provided the means for defining and protecting property rights in the land. They established procedures for registration of land claims, as well as for protection of those claims against outsiders, and for adjudication of internal disputes that arose. The reciprocal arrangements for protection would be maintained only if a member complied with the association's rules and its court's rulings. Anyone who refused would be ostracized. Boycott by a land club meant that an individual had no protection against aggression other than what he could provide himself.}}
According to Anderson, "Defining anarcho-capitalist to mean minimal government with property rights developed from the bottom up, the western frontier was anarcho-capitalistic. People on the frontier invented institutions that fit the resource constraints they faced."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.newwest.net/topic/article/grilling_terry_l_anderson_free_market_environmentalist/C39/L39/|title=Grilling Terry L.

===Post-Feudal Sicily===
The Mafia began in the 19th century.  Modern scholars believe that the seeds were planted in the upheaval of Sicily's transition out of [[feudalism]] beginning in 1812 and its later annexation by mainland Italy in 1860. Under feudalism, the nobility owned most of the land and enforced law and order through their private armies. After 1812, the feudal barons steadily sold off or rented their lands to private citizens. [[Primogeniture]] was abolished, land could no longer be seized to settle debts, and one fifth of the land became private property of the peasants.&lt;ref name=sardell&gt;Jason Sardell, [http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031609-103313/unrestricted/JSardellMafia.pdf Economic Origins of the Mafia and Patronage System in Sicily], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After Italy annexed Sicily in 1860, it redistributed a large share of public and church land to private citizens. The result was a huge boom in landowners — from 2,000 in 1812 to 20,000 by 1861.&lt;ref name=bandiera&gt;[[Oriana Bandiera]], [http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/bandiera/mafia1101.pdf Private States and the Enforcement of Property Rights: Theory and evidence on the origins of the Sicilian mafia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319025549/http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/bandiera/mafia1101.pdf |date=2012-03-19 }}, 2001, pp. 8-10&lt;/ref&gt; With this increase in property owners and commerce came more disputes that needed settling, contracts that needed enforcing, transactions that needed oversight, and properties that needed protecting. The barons were releasing their private armies to let the state take over the job of enforcing the law, but the new authorities were not up to the task, largely due to their inexperience with capitalism.&lt;ref name=Gambetta1993p94&gt;{{harvp|Gambetta|1993|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of manpower was also a problem; there were often fewer than 350 active policemen for the entire island. Some towns did not have any permanent police force, only visited every few months by some troops to collect malcontents, leaving criminals to operate with impunity in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;D. Mack Smith. ''A History of Sicily: Modern Sicily, after 1713''. p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding these problems was banditry; rising food prices,&lt;ref name=bandiera/&gt; the loss of public and church lands,&lt;ref name=sardell/&gt; and the loss of feudal [[common rights|commons]] pushed many desperate peasants to steal. In the face of rising crime, booming commerce, and inefficient authorities, property owners turned to extralegal arbitrators and protectors.  These extralegal protectors eventually organized themselves into the first Mafia clans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12643">'''Pyknon''', {{lang-el|πυκνόν}}, sometimes also transliterated as '''pycnon''' (from {{lang-el|πυκνός}} close, close-packed, crowded, condensed; {{lang-lat|spissus}}) in the music theory of Antiquity is a structural property of any [[tetrachord]] in which a composite of two smaller intervals is less than the remaining ([[incomposite interval|incomposite]]) interval. The makeup of the ''pyknon'' serves to identify the [[Genus (music)|melodic genus]] (also called "genus of a tetrachord") and the [[octave species]] made by compounding two such tetrachords, and the rules governing the ways in which such compounds may be made centre on the relationships of the two ''pykna'' involved.

==Definition==
The ''pyknon'' was an important criterion in the classification of melodic genera ({{lang-el|γένη τῶν μελῳδουμένων}}). The Greek word πυκνόν is an adjective meaning "close", "compact", "close-packed", or "crowded" {{harv|Liddell and Scott|1996}}. In Ancient Greek music theory, this term is used to describe a pair of intervals within a [[tetrachord]], the sum of which is less than the remainder of the tetrachord {{harv|Levin|2007|loc=413}}. Although in modern usage, a tetrachord may be ''any'' four-note segment of a [[musical scale|scale]], or indeed any (unordered) collection of four [[pitch class]]es, in ancient Greek music theory a tetrachord consists of a four-note segment of the [[Musical system of ancient Greece#Syst.C3.AAma Ametabolon.2C an overview of the tone system|Greater and Lesser Perfect Systems]] bounded by the interval of a perfect fourth, the outer notes of which remain fixed in all genera and therefore are called "standing notes" ({{lang-el|ἑστῶτες φθόγγοι}}). The positions of the inner notes vary from one genus to another, for which reason they are called "movable notes" ({{harvnb|Mathiesen|1999|loc=301, 312, 322, 344, 350, et passim}}; from {{lang-el|κινούμενοι φθόγγοι}}). In its basic theoretical form, the largest interval of a tetrachord is at the top, and the smallest at the bottom. The existence of a ''pyknon'' therefore depends on the uppermost interval being larger than half of a perfect fourth, which occurs only in the [[Chromatic genus|chromatic]] and [[Enharmonic genus|enharmonic genera]]. Because the [[diatonic genus]] consists of two whole tones and one semitone, no single interval is larger than the other two combined, and so there is no ''pyknon'' {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=229}}. For this reason, the enharmonic and chromatic genera are sometimes called the "pyknic genera", in order to distinguish them from the diatonic {{harv|Solomon|1984|loc=246}}.

==Theoretical applications==
The notes of the central tetrachord of the system in ascending order are ''hypate'', ''parhypate'', ''lichanos'' (or ''hypermese''), and ''mese''. A second tetrachord is added above, after a disjunctive tone, and the corresponding names (together with the interval ratios of the standing tones) are ({{harvnb|Chalmers|1990|loc=4}}; {{harvnb|Mathiesen|1999|loc=245}}):
*''mese'' (4:3) – ''nete'' (2:1) (standing)
*''lichanos'' – ''paranete'' (movable)
*''parhypate'' – ''trite'' (movable)
*''hypate'' (1:1) – ''paramese'' (3:2) (standing)
Although movable, the ''lichanos'' must remain above the ''parhypate'', and the ''paranete'' above the ''trite'' {{harv|Mathiesen|1999|loc=312}}.

A "composite interval" is one made up of two or more smaller intervals; an "incomposite interval" has no smaller components In these terms, if the composite interval between the ''hypate'' and the ''lichanos'' (or ''paramese'' and ''paranete'') is smaller than the incomposite interval from the ''lichanos'' to the ''mese'' (or ''paranete'' to ''nete''), the three notes in that composite interval are together called a ''pyknon'' {{harv|Mathiesen|1999|loc=312}}. In the diatonic genus, because the composite interval from ''hypate'' to ''lichanos'' (a minor third) is larger than the remaining incomposite interval from ''lichanos'' to ''mese'' (a whole tone), the lowest three notes of the diatonic tetrachord are designated ''apyknon'': "not close-packed" {{harv|Barbera|1977|loc=321n11}}.

==Enharmonic==
[[File:Greek Dorian enharmonic genus.png|thumb|right|300px|Two pyknic enharmonic tetrachords, together comprising the Greek [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] [[octave species]] in the enharmonic genus]]
In the enharmonic genus, the large incomposite interval was originally a [[ditone]] (the [[major third]] of [[Pythagorean tuning]]), leaving a ''pyknon'' with a total width of just a [[semitone]]. The Pythagorean ditone is equivalent to two 9:8 ''epogdoa'', or [[major second]]s), together an interval of 81:64, thus leaving a ''pyknon'' of 256:243—a [[Pythagorean limma#Pythagorean tuning|limma]] (minor Pythagorean semitone), but how the ''pyknon'' was exactly (that is by exact mathematic calculation) divided into its two component intervals is not known {{harv|Chalmers|1990|loc=9}}. The tuning of [[Eratosthenes]], as reported by [[Aristoxenus]], uses a major third of 19:15 with the two unequal intervals of the ''pyknon'' in the ratios of 40:39 and 39:38 {{harv|Chalmers|1990|loc=8}}. Although Aristoxenus also implies that the two intervals of the ''pyknon'' in the enharmonic genus may be equal {{harv|Mathiesen|1999|loc=333}}, the anonymous author of the Euclidean ''Sectio Canonis'' (P18) is unequivocal: "The ''parhypatai'' and ''tritai'' do not divide the ''pyknon'' into equal intervals" {{harv|Barker|1981|loc=6}}.

[[Ptolemy]] reports in his ''Harmonics'' (2. 14) that two other theorists, [[Archytas]] and [[Didymus the musician|Didymus]], replaced the ditone with the smaller, [[Just tuning|just]] major third with the number ratio of 5:4, making the ''pyknon'' correspondingly larger {{harv|West|1992|loc=170}}. This ''pyknon'' was divided differently by these two theorists, but in both cases the two intervals were not equal to one another. Archytas, who was the first theorist to give ratios for all of the genera, chose 28:27 and 36:35, and Didymus, some four centuries later, gave 32:31 and 31:30 {{harv|Chalmers|1990|loc=7–8}}.

==Chromatic==
[[File:Greek Dorian chromatic genus.png|thumb|right|300px|Two pyknic chromatic tetrachords, together comprising the Greek [[Dorian mode|Dorian]] [[octave species]] in the chromatic genus]]
In the chromatic genus, the largest interval was called a {{lang-el|τριημιτόνιόν ἀσύνθετον}}, {{lang-lat|triemitonium incompositum}}—translated as "incomposite" (or "noncomposite") "trihemitone" ({{harvnb|Bower|1989|loc=43}}; {{harvnb|Hagel|2009|loc=105, 266, 267}}; {{harvnb|Levin|1994|loc=125, 174}}; {{harvnb|Barker|1989|loc=261, 267}}, prefers a descriptive translation, "an individed interval of three semitones"; {{harvnb|Strunk|1998|loc=36, 37}} uses "trisemitone"), the modern term being "[[minor third]]"—leaving a ''pyknon'' of some type of whole tone to be divided into two semitones. There is a larger number of variations in the tuning of the chromatic than in the enharmonic. Up to the beginning of the 4th century BC the chromatic ''pyknon'' spanned a major whole tone with a 9:8 ratio, and this was divided by Gaudentius into ascending semitone intervals of 256:243 and  2187:2048 {{harv|Chalmers|1990|loc=8}}. Ptolemy defined two different tunings of the chromatic genus: the "soft" chromatic with a smaller ''pyknon'' and the "intense" chromatic with a larger one. The unequal semitones dividing the ''pykna'' were in ratios of 28:27 and 15:14 for the soft chromatic and 22:21 and 12:11 for the intense. The larger remaining interval was 6:5 in the soft chromatic and 7:6 in the intense {{harv|Chalmers|1990|loc=9}}.

==Scale structure==
[[File:Mixolydian chromatic.png|thumb|right|300px|Greek [[Mixolydian mode|Mixolydian]] octave species on E in the chromatic genus: conjunct tetrachords ''a'' and ''b'', with note of conjunction ''c'', and interval of disjunction ''d''; the two ''pykna'' are separated by the larger interval between steps 3 and 4 {{audio|Greek Mixolydian mode on E, chromatic genus.mid|Play}}]]
A further refinement of tetrachordal construction, according to Aristoxenus, is that the lower interval of the ''pyknon'' must be smaller than or equal to the upper one {{harv|Barbera|1984|loc=229–30}}. Didymus in the chromatic genus and Archytas in the enharmonic broke this rule, however, and in the ''Harmonics'' (2. 13) Ptolemy criticized this feature in Didymus, holding that it is unmelodic and out of agreement with the evidence of our ears {{harv|West|1992|loc=170}}.

According to Aristoxenus (''Elements of Harmony'', book 2), whenever tetrachords are combined to form a scale filling an octave, "Two consecutive pycna may not occur in ascent or descent. A ditone may precede or follow [a pycnon] in ascent or descent. A tone may follow [a pycnon] only in descent" {{harv|Mathiesen|1999|loc=331}}.

'''''Security, Territory, Population''''' is a part of [[Foucault's lectures at the Collège de France|a lecture series]] given by French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] at the [[Collège de France]] between 1977 and 1978 and published posthumously based on audio recordings. In it, Foucault examines the notion of [[biopolitics]] as a new technology of power over populations that is distinct from punitive disciplinary systems, by tracing the history of [[governmentality]], from the first centuries of the Christian era to the emergence of the modern nation state. These lectures illustrate a radical turning point in Foucault's work in which a shift to the problematic of the government of self and others occurred.

== Territory ==
Foucault tries to trace the 'government of things' in relation to modern society, starting with [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] ''[[The Prince]]'' and its reception&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 87-114 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Machiavellian literature wanted to replace the ability of the prince to hold on to his principality with something entirely new: an art of government.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 92-109 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault then notices that this art of government was internal to society itself, not external, this type of self-government was practiced rit throughout European society; such as Italy, Germany, France, etc. which was seized upon by the modern nation state from which it took up as its central practices. This is from as early as the 16th century which in due course enabled the elimination of the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] prince as a transcendental, singularity figure of Machiavelli's prince.

All of society was enmeshed within this process including the prince (ruler) himself, thus a century later government became political and collaborative with economy (modern [[political science]] as its 'rational' spokesman) and its partnership with [[political economy]]. Foucault further notices that political economy had a new tool called statistics founded by the [[Physiocrats]] economists&lt;ref&gt;Foucault makes mention the infamous group for this 'scientific state apparatus' the [[Physiocrats]] ''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 33-49 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foucault mentions an important figure from this period which, according to Foucault was highly influential a Physiocrat economist [[Louis Paul Abeille]] Security, Territory, Population p. 30 pp. 50-52; see notes n. 1 p. 50, n. 17, p. 52 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (another term for scientific government) and it is with [[François Quesnay]] that this process can be found the very notion of economic government. So, according to a text quoted by Foucault written by [[Guillaume de La Perrière]] "government is the right disposition of things arranged so as to lead a suitable end."&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 96 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Political means the institutions that are governing the rest of society; government covered by legal institutions which gives both the political electorate, political executive and political legitimacy,&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 135-161 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 142-149 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault traces this practice to the ancient Greek text from the [[Pythagoreans]] known as ''nomas'' (meaning the law) and according to this text the shepherd is the lawmaker, he directs the flock, indicates the right direction and says how the sheep must mate to have good offspring.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 137-140 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault then reads into [[Robert Castel]]'s work; ''The Psychiatric Order'', an essential read according to Foucault, where the techniques were finally finalised during the 18th century of this absolute global project which was directed towards the whole of society.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 117-119 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 10-14 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Which was public hygiene and a whole battery of other techniques were used concerning the education of children, assistance to the poor, and through the psychiatric order, the institution of workers tutelage was coordinated through psychiatric practices. These technologies of power, Foucault claims, were introduced into the 18th century emerging prison system which migrated into the modern surveillance society through the infamous system that [[Jeremy Bentham]] tried to introduce, the [[Panopticon]];&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 117, p. 131; see notes 7 and 8 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; the modern internal and external surveillance system that modern society inhabits 'self watch' and 'self government'.

Accomplishing the unintended axiomatic affect of unaccountability, while the full focal point of a ruler is often presented unchallenged to the populace as a system of unimaginable alterations, self-perpetuating and self regularity (among those who inhabit the system), where clearly defined roles are defined and repeated right throughout the system(through norms).&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 11-13 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The system can readjust itself to whatever is thrown at it (an internal firewall integral to the system where the dangerous individual can be spotted and isolated at will). This was accomplished, according to Foucault, (rather paradoxically) from power relations elsewhere from other institutions in order to analyse them from the point of view of other technologies to free them elsewhere to form new systematic institutions as new knowledge objects. Foucault traces this original practice to government practices of the Middle Ages, where the term government meant an entirely different definition as modern society knows it. For example, 'enough wheat to govern Paris for two years', this covers a wide semantic view, it also refers to control of one's body, soul and behaviour, conduct, diet, the care given to an individual. Which Foucault very often refers to as 'governmentality', self conduct or self-government. Foucault traces this tactic back through history to the east (Mediterranean East, Egypt, Assyrian Empire, Babylonian etc.) which was specific to those societies. In Foucault own words this very aspect of Foucault's own work is still a work in progress, and is not a finalised research. However, Foucault situates this type of pastoral power squarely onto the new founded Christian Church where an organized religion ruled an entire society politically for 1500 years. And what was produced or outcome of all this turbulence was constant battles of supremacy for this type of pastoral power, government over men and their souls.

The Church rapidly colonized this type of new power between 11th and 18th century, and according to Foucault, the church laid claim to the daily government of men in their real lives on the grounds of their salvation and no example of this exist anywhere in history of societies.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 191-226 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 227-253 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 232-253 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Foucault research goes on to show that all the religious struggles from this period were fundamentally struggles over who would actually have the right to govern men, and to govern men in their daily lives they were practically struggles over who had the right to this power. Foucault then derives from this that from the 11th to the 18th century all the struggles of religion (wars of religion) were fundamentally struggles over who would actually have the right to govern men, and to govern men in their daily lives and in details and materiality of their existence; they were struggles over who has this power, from whom it derives, how it is exercised, the margin of autonomy for each, the qualification of those who exercise it, the limits of their jurisdiction, what recourse is possible against them, and what control is exercised over each. The [[Protestant Reformation]] traversed this relationship of pastorate power and what resulted from the reformation, although an historical event, was a formidable reinforcement of the pastorate system of religious power (political power in modern societies).

This type of religious power (pastoral power) was simply a reorganization of pastoral power from within, but, however, this type of reorganization of pastoral power encroached on the sovereigns (ruler) political power at the same time, it was not a smooth transition as is often portrayed. This led to a succession of tumultuous upheavals and revolts over this period, 11th-18th century; [[Norman Conquest]], [[English Civil War]], [[The Anarchy]], [[Hundred Years' War]], [[Crusades]], [[Peasants' Revolt]], [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]], [[popular revolt in late medieval Europe]]. All of which are well attested too, Foucault refers to these revolts as revolts against conduct, the most radical of which were the Protestant reformation. Foucault then concludes that this political process can be traced to the general context of resistances, revolts and great insurrections of conduct (Peasants' Revolt of 1524-1526 for example).

== Raison d'État (reason of State) ==
Foucault concludes that these insurrections of conduct push started the transition of the pastoral of souls to the political government of men and the revolts, insurrections of conduct and resistances should be seen in this context. The new economic and consequently the political relations which the old feudal structures were unable to manage and lacked any effective framework, with which they were unable to cope. Foucault notices that the pastorate community were swamped with everyday life of individuals where it took charge of a whole series of questions and problem concerning material life, property, education of children. This led to an re-emergence of philosophy as the answer to the fundamental question of everyday life, in relation to others, in relation to those in authority, to the sovereign, or the feudal lord, and in order to direct one's mind as well, and to direct it in the right direction, to its salvation, certainly, but also to the truth.

Philosophy took over from this period; on the religious function of how to conduct oneself as a result of taking a form that was not specially religious or ecclesiastical. With the advent of the 16th century western society enter the age of forms of conducting, directing, and government. Foucault then considers these great upheavals of [[Medieval Europe]] as nothing else but the translation of the continuum from god to men, political institutions and the political order. Which was broken by all the upheaval that Europe had suffered. This produced a series of conflicts among those who tried to define sovereignty (not political sovereignty as we know it) but the art of government, ''principia naturae'' (reason of government) which brought in the political philosophy doctrine, known as [[raison d'État]] (reason of state).&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Biopolitics'' pp. 1-25 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 16th century, Western society begins to define itself as territorial and expansionary with means of security as its primary focus.

Foucault reads into this that the philosophy of raison d'État having found its way into Europe through the [[Peace of Westphalia]]&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 285-310 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; (known as the [[Balance of power (international relations)|Balance of power]] in modern thought);&lt;ref&gt;Foucault mentions the term as it was known then, Balance of Europe; however, the word 'Europe' was an entirely new concept in 17th century Europe, it had no basis nor meaning to thinkers of political thought from this period but the term balance of Europe and whose chief political architect and origin of the term can be found in the works of [[Francesco Guicciardini]]. The other 'scientific' proponent of the idea of balance of Europe can be found in the works of none other than mathematician [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] "What is the balance of Europe?It is the idea of a political-military physics in which variable antagonistic forces are exercised in terms of random violent clashes of some with others, of some against others. The balance of Europe is not a problem of statics, but of dynamics." ''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 297-310 p. 308, notes 14, 16 for Guicciardini 2007&lt;/ref&gt; this can be found in the works of Italian political philosopher [[Giovanni Botero]]&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 237-240 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; where Botero concluded that the state is a firm domination over peoples and to keep hold of its preservation one was expected to have knowledge of the appropriate means for founding preserving, and expanding such a domination.

This political philosophy of raison d'État was made as the chief political philosophy (with its accompanied rationality) in mainland Europe. Foucault's analysis of raison d'État (here [[Bogislaw Philipp von Chemnitz]] son of [[Martin von Chemnitz]]) writing under the pseudonym ''[[Hippolithus a Lapide]]'' first starts to query the first uses of the doctrine of raison d'État at the Treaty of Westphalia, where among the diplomatic community the doctrine starts to become popular for discussion&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 240-248, pp. 250-252, notes, 24-25 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;) offers interesting conclusions of this new type of power the transition of the government of souls to the government of men. This first takes place between 13th century and the 18th century, from the 16th century the subject starts to appear of an idea of perpetual peace taken from the Middle Ages idea. Which primarily belonged to the church, from the 16th century therefore, exists the idea of a 'balance of power', with few exceptions, this idea became problematic, it started or rather had to included the populace.

The solution to this problematic situation was the inclusion, within the philosophy of raison d'État, the incorporation of the populace which the machinery of the state had to govern. The government of men as Foucault refers to it, directly from the pastorate community to the transfer to the political community. Foucault then further shows that raison d'État was not much concerned with legality (as we know the term) but with political necessity; politics is concerned with necessity and if necessary politics must become violent lending to [[coup d'état]]; this means that it is obliged to sacrifice, to sever, cause harm, and it is led to be unjust and murderous. This produced a whole series of problematic solutions to this problem, of which the population became of primary concern, coup d'état&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 260-267 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 277-278 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; politics isn't the practice as we know it today. Under the auspices of the [[Renaissance]] was not primarily concerned with legitimacy, but survival of the state.

Foucault then tries to show only when the problem of population and security starts taking effect amongst the different practices that the consideration of population becomes a worry. Foucault then notices a point of departure pointing out the idea of sedition and revolt starts to enter texts, but 'the people' proved elusive to define all around Europe, and never entered popular discussion, at first point of juncture was the privileged titled nobles appointed and rewarded through the honours system created by the monarch and sanctioned through the legal system of the day; the entire [[Nobility]] knight's, barons, dukes, earl's and their rivals began to become seen and known as 'the people'.&lt;ref&gt;"The people were too hard for the King in property; and then in arms too hard for him. We must either lay the foundation in property, or else it will not stand. Property, generally, is now with the people; the government, therefore, must be there." ''Thomas Burton Diary Volume 3'' pp. 146-148, note 36 1658-1659&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"All government is built upon propriety, else the poor must rule it. All nations are so. Let us therefore consider things before persons. Government is built upon propriety, therefore lands, leases, or goods, should be represented, rather than the people."Quoted from Captain Baynes in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] in ''Thomas Burton Diary Volume 3'' pp. 146-148, note 36 1658-1659&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;A certain Mr. Neville refers to the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] brought in by [[Henry VIII]] and parliament by the authority and power given to the monarch of the day by the [[Act of Supremacy]] passed by parliament under Henry VIII which brought the first ensemble apparatus of what would later become known as the Welfare state 350 years later Quoted From ''Thomas Burton Diary Of Parliamentary Debate Volume 3 '' pp. 132-134 1658-1659&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"I wonder what is the necessity for this previous vote. We are returned to the law of nature. It is said in the Bill the people have all acknowledged him. I thought the people had been only here. Either he is so, or he is not so. If so, there is no necessity for this House declaring him so. If not, there is need of some consideration. The Bill makes it hereditary. Where it speaks of successor, it mentions nothing of the Petition and Advice. It is fit you should be satisfied whether he be so. It should be made out. It makes him Supreme Magistrate, and gives him as great a power as ever King of England had. I would know what the words mean, if it give him not the executive and legislative power as fully as any King. Consider whether you do not put yourselves out of a capacity of recalling your liberties, by this step. First, you settle a monarch; one estate before the other two" Quoted from Captain Baynes Baynes refers to the 'people' in terms only limited to those 'elected' "that out of the 658 members sent to the House, only 171 were sent by the people. In 1794, "the majority of the House of Commons," for England and Wales, was computed to be "chosen by less than eight thousand, out of eight millions" which comprises less than 00.001% of the 'people' to the House of commons; see note 38 taken from ''Thomas Burton Diary Of Parliamentary Debate Volume 3'' pp. 145-150&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population ==
Foucault considers the breakthrough of "this governmental reasoning" of the population as a substantial event in Western history and society comparable to the [[scientific revolution]] of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 285-286 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Where a substantial transfer of techniques and technologies were transferred from the sovereign individual (the monarch) to a new modified apparatus known as the [[Disciplinary institutions]], of the 18th century and its scientific representatives [[Carceral archipelago]], ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (all in the space of 80 years Foucault's notices) which culminated into a new version known as [[nation state]]s. This change took place in the 16th century and continued right through into the 19th century. Foucault then gives examples of this procedure through the system known as ''[[raison d'État]]'', from this analytical view of the state by [[Claude Fleury]],&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 323-324 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 331, notes 31, 32, 34, 38 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; war, raising finance, justice; there must be an abundance of men (large scale phenomena of population).

It is not the absolute number of the population that counts, but its relationship with the set composition of forces: the size of the territory, natural resources, wealth, commercial activities and so on. From Fleury's point of view, according to Foucault, the more there are of men, the stronger the state and the prince will be. So, according to Fleury, it is not expanse of land (expansion of the territory) that contributes greatness of the state but fertility and the number of men. Foucault then introduces into his [[Ontogenetic]] and, [[Phylogenetic]] investigations the concept of '[[police]]' (see also [[miasma theory of disease]]); not the police of the [[criminal justice system]] as we know it today, but as concept known at that time as urbanisation of the territory and administrative concern; which means making the kingdom, the entire territory into a large industrious town. Foucault then considers how [[Mercantilism]] played a big role in this new context of European balance of power; these are the mercantilist requirements: every country should try to have the largest possible population, second; the entire population be eligible for working and be able to be put to work, third; wages given to the population be as low as possible, fourth; the cost price of goods at the lowest price as possible. Police according to Foucault consists of a sovereign exercise of royal power over individuals who are therefore subjects.

The actual police is the direct governmentality of the sovereign who rules through raison d'État. What Foucault means by the governmentality of the sovereign is the mind of the police runs through all of the populations, collective consciousness therefore, reducing criminality not its complete elimination, for political and economic reasons (see ''[[Discipline and Punish]]''), not through fear, but the knowledge of the police as a system with its own structural objective as laws, judicial, legislative operating as a microcosm of the societal body, which ultimately represents the sovereigns will. Initially, however, this was not the sole intention of the police as we know it where Foucault introduces the original founder of the system now known to us as the police, [[Nicolas Delamare|Nicolas Delamare (1639-1723)]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Delamare 1639-1723 Delamare served as Superintendent at Chatelet from 1673 to 1710 under the lieutenancy of La Reynie this is Foucault's only mention of La Reynie in his lectures for more information on Delamare see ''Security, Territory, Population'' the following notes p. 53 n. 26, pp. 359-360 n. 1-9 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (Foucault doesn’t mention the real founder of the police [[Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie]]).

Foucault concentrates on how the police became an integral feature and intermingled with population, tracing the system on its foundation on how this is arranged around the composition of forces which the whole Western system of the balance of power, raison E’tat was organised and arranged around. This system consisted of an organised scientifically trained professional army,(as opposed to a private army organised around the service of the king) incorporated within this military system is [[Thantopolitics]]([[Political power]] used through the military system for the purposes of warfare by other means) for the purposes of the slaughtering of millions of people if necessary,on an industrial scale,&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 285-310 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 299, pp. 304-306, p. 307, notes 9-19 2007&lt;/ref&gt; a system of legitimacy, comprising the sovereign, not the sovereign as a singular ruler but as an organised superstructure institution(modern government) comprising societal state functions, [[Political sovereignty]] which guaranteed the sovereign's legitimacy, judiciary, legislator, [[Parliamentary]] system; political power, political executive, political elite, and a political communication system while not offered any considerable attention by some Social scientist and historians nevertheless,these techniques do indeed exist,where it is admitted as such by those actual professional technicians(one such technique used is known professionally as the [[Sabido method]] pioneered by [[Miguel Sabido]] derived from the field of [[entertainment-education]])and the political arm of this technique simply known as [[Demagogue]] who are involved in the operation of these techniques of deception and persuasion and a whole group of professional manipulators are needed which is primarily aimed at the entire worldwide television audience and political community.&lt;ref&gt;"Since The Arrival of mass communication,a particular kind of image making has grown into a central feature of the political processes of Western democracies.The book will argue that a core feature of mass democratic politics is ''hype making''.Just as magicians smoke-and mirrors-to distract their audidences and conjure up illusions so too does the political machine and its media staffers.In today's Western democracies,television is the primary(but not exclusive)vehicle for this smoke-and-mirrors show.This show involves four sets of players:politicians-as-performers;the spin industry;media workers(journalists,presenters/hosts and researchers);and their audiencies. A fifth set of players are policy makers-but they tend to remain back stage;shielded from as much scrutiny as possible by the smoke and mirriors show.A core aim of this book is to unravel the symbiotic relationships between journalists,and spin doctors and politicians within contemporary televisualized politics.The book will argue that Demagoguery has become a core feature 20th century Western politics,with politics now characterized by a range of demagogic arts geared to steering mass public opinion.These demagogic arts will be described and analyzed." Eric Louwe ''The Media and Political Process'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David O Poindexter]] ''Out Of The Darkness Of Centuries:A 45 Year Odyssey To Discover The Use Of Mass Media For Human Betterment'' 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Halisbury Laws Of England Volume 34 Parliament 4th Edition 1984''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Indeed, techniques of deception have undergone enormous improvements since Orwell's time. Many of these techniques were developed in connection with the advertising and marketing of commercial products and services, and then adapted to politics. Their distinguishing feature is that they can be bought for money. More recently, cognitive science has helped to make the techniques of deception even more effective, giving rise to political professionals who concentrate only on "getting results"

These professionals take pride in their accomplishments, and may even enjoy the respect of an American public that admires success no matter how it is achieved. That fact casts doubt on Karl Popper's concept of an open society, which is based on the recognition that, while perfect knowledge is unattainable, we can gain a better understanding of reality by engaging in critical thinking.

Popper failed to recognise that in democratic politics, gathering public support takes precedence over the pursuit of truth. In other areas, such as science and industry, the impulse to impose one's views on the world encounters the resistance of external reality. But in politics the electorate's perception of reality can be easily manipulated. As a result, political discourse, even in democratic societies, does not necessarily lead to a better understanding of reality.

The reason democratic politics leads to manipulation is that politicians do not aspire to tell the truth. They want to win elections, and the best way to do that is to skew reality to their own benefit."

And finally, the final piece in the jigsaw puzzle; the western political system of [[consent of the governed]]. This system at least gives the rationale of why it was necessary to have on board a widely disparate atomized populace; and its use, through the not widely known and little understood function of the [[Royal Prerogative]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/royal-prerogative.pdf|format=PDF|title=Review of the Executive Royal Prerogative Powers 2010|publisher=Justice.gov.uk|accessdate=29 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20091111115352/http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/docs/royal-prerogative.pdf|archivedate=11 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmpubadm/422/422.pdf |format=PDF|title=Taming the Prerogative: Strengthening Ministerial Accountability to Parliament 2004|publisher=Publications.parliament.uk|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foucault doesn't use the phrase [[Royal Prerogative]] but uses the term 'Royal power' ''The Birth Of Biopolitics'' pp. 7-9, p. 37 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of which can be traced back to the Middle Ages from where the western system of political power gets its central idea, from the point of view and simple justification of consent of the governed, legitimacy and political power. This legitimacy, which is exercised through the use of Parliamentary democracy(see also [[Greek government debt crisis]], [[National unity government]], [[European sovereign debt crisis]]), was essential to the western system of political power and modern government;"The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government","The people" identifies the entire body of the citizens of a jurisdiction invested with political power or gathered for political purposes'" or "Popular sovereignty or the sovereignty of the people is the political principle that the legitimacy of the state is created by the will or consent of its people, who are the source of all political power".

All of this Foucault calls the political technology of biopower. This had to have the entire population on board in terms of ‘the police’, which had an entirely different meaning from what we know it today by tracing the concept back through time from the 15th century and 16th century usage, previous thinkers meant the term as a community association governed by a public authority and political power with accountability to a public authority. By quoting [[Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi]] “of laws and regulations that concern the interior of a state and which endeavors to strengthen and increase the power of this state and make good use of its forces".&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 314-315 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population''; see note 8 pp. 329-330 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

What Foucault reveals is that the original police had a different function as we know it today; for example one of their primary function was to administer the state in the guise of statisticians, allocating resources, supervision of grain in times of crisis, ensuring circulation of goods and men, secure the development of the state's forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 311-332 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; This was so successful this then led to an extension of the franchising out in the form of recruitment of the then [[University]] system. This bought in the next generation of administrators for the new ‘nation state’ system. This bought in two types of police; administrators who formed the [[Polizeiwissenschaft]]; the science of police or the science of government of the state, the other type would become known as what we know and associate the term today [[criminal justice system]], [[Law enforcement]], [[Forensic science]] and the modern uniformed police [[Polizeistaat]] police state, translated into English as policing of the state.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 318-319 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 330; see note 14 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally from Germany, this system spread right throughout Europe from the middle of the 17th century and most crucially, this Polizeiwissenschaft grow a substantial bibliography of this system ‘science of police’ by the 19th century. Foucault's research shows that some 4000 different pamphlets and articles had emerged from 1520-1850 under the titles of “science of police in the broad sense” and “science of the police in the strict sense”.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 318 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population p. 330; see note 11 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; This became known as [[Cameral]] science(the new modern [[Public administration]]). The future administrators for the future modern nation state system with many functions; such as [[bureaucrats]], [[civil servants]], [[Think tanks]], [[public policy]] makers, [[economists]] all from the university system.

== Obedience ==
For Foucault obedience was a vital mechanism of salvation of the government, not in the form of blind loyalty, but in the form of political salvation of the state(see [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|Oath of Allegiance]] for example). This led to political theorists of the day juxtaposing theories concerning state, government, body politics, and political power; these theorists dare not call these laws divine or God-made law, but instead refer to them as 'philosophical'. As in [[Gabriel Naudé]],&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population p. 252, note 40 2007&lt;/ref&gt; an agent of Richelieu's, where he refers to the salvation of the state "The coup d'état does not comply with natural, universal noble and philosophical, it complies with an artificial, particular, political justice concerning the necessity of the state&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population pp. 260-261, p. 263, pp. 280-281, notes 20-21, 24-25, 26 2007&lt;/ref&gt;". For Foucault, politics is not above this process which it cannot be afforded, therefore, is not something that has to fall within a remit of legality or a system of laws. Politics, according to Foucault's use of the term, is concerned with necessity, necessity of the state which puts to an end to all privileges in order to make itself obeyed by everyone. So you do not have government connected with legality, but raison d'État connected with necessity.

Foucault then touches briefly on the theatrical practice of raison d'État and its prevalence over legitimacy. Which would be rather ironical as this is the main problem of theatrical practice in politics, which was in reality the practice of raison d'État. The theatre where this is played out in the form of dramatization and a constant mode of manifestation of the state and the sovereign as the holder of state power. Thus, for Foucault analysis this contrasts differently with and in opposition to traditional ceremonies of royalty which from anointment to coronation up to the entry into towns or major cities or iconic, famous funerals of infamous monarchs, this marked the religious association of the sovereign, or at least the sovereign's alliance with the character and association with religious power and theology. This, Foucault notices was [[William Shakespeare]]'s main intention where the political representation (modern representation of this is media visual representation of political power, political consultants, image makers (media consultants), and 'power politics' and its constant fixation with voting and leading political personalities) of the sovereign [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] for example was a part of historical drama, although based on real people and events, but for all intents and purposes was political representation in the form of plots, intrigues, disgraces, preferences, exclusions, good guys and bad guys and political exiles, where the theatre represents the state itself.

Foucault now turns his attention to obedience and the population and why this was a problem among political theorists of the times. He then produces [[Francis Bacon]]'s text "Of Seditions and Troubles". In this essay Bacon gives a complete description on the physics of sedition, sedition and the precautions to be taken against it, and of government of the 'people'. This became a worry for Bacon and other political theorists; the first signs of sedition were circulation of libels, pamphlets and discourse against the state and those who govern. Second, Bacon notices the reversal of values or evaluations which puts the existence at risk. Weakness in the chain of command. Foucault reads into Bacon the theory of revolt of the people and there are two categories of individuals within the state, the common people (very often referred in text as [[Peasants]], the [[People]], the [[Common people]], the poor, or at times [[Vagabond (person)|Vagabond]] vagrants) and the nobility, what differentiates the common people and the nobility is their unshared interest.

They do not have any common interest between the two groups in Bacon's view the common people are too slow to engage in revolt and sedition. But if the common people and the nobility ever unite and become one unit they represent a threat to the sovereign's rule. A slow people and a weak nobility (because of their small number) mean that sedition can be prevented and discontents stopped from contaminating each other. Bacon then views the process of the danger of sedition where you can either buy the nobility or you can execute them.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 267-275 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of the common people becomes a different matter, they are not easily bought. So Bacon himself offers a whole series of measures and reforms that should be implemented, reducing the rate of interest, avoiding excessively large estates, increased wages, promoting external trade increasing the value of raw materials through work, and assuring provisions of transport to foreign countries.

While the differences between Bacon and Machiavelli appear subtle, it was 250 years later that the political model of reforms changed, why? Foucault was not much interested into the notion of reform as 'cure', but what was behind the underlying mechanism that was driving the system of reform ensuring reforms become a permanent feature of 'failure'. Foucault begins to trace through this development through the political model of reform and one crucial development was the economy, a politics of economic calculation with Mercantilism and for Foucault this was not just a theory but was above all else a political practice. The invention of the political campaign which Foucault traces back through its original modern founder, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who according to Foucault actually invented the modern political campaign by means of lampoons and pamphlets and more importantly, invented those professional manipulators of opinion who were called at the time ''[[publiciste]]s''.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 255-283 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 283, notes 59, 60 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, for Foucault raison d'État must always act on the collective consciousness of the population, not only to impose some true or false belief on them, as when, for example, sovereigns want to create belief in their own legitimacy or in illegitimacy of their rivals, but in such away that the collective opinion can be modified along with their behaviour as economic and political subjects. The main function of public opinion is to produce a politics of believable truth within raison d'État.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 272-283. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious example of all this is that propaganda, in its political sense has a twofold objective: 1, The main function of public opinion is to produce an emergence, alliance between political propaganda and a belief system of politics of truth within collective consciousness, a version of political continuity within raison d’Etat, this practice of political reform, while ensuring that the essential features of the system remain intact, gets passed on to future generations ensuring failure.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 272-283.(2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 2, The other main political purposes of propaganda is to make sure that the chaos of modern living becomes accepted as the norm therefore, rendering whole swathes of society useless (through cultural practices), in its objectives to do anything about it. You can do something about it, but only within the rules of a political tool, even within the confines of political buffoons who appear to have no hold or control of the system that they are in charge of.

This political tool is soiled and rigged against those who use it and cannot be used for practical change but its power comes from those who gives comfort to those who use it in the hope of a false belief of change can happen leaving the practicalities of the system as ‘real’ events. This, Foucault notices produced two consensus correlations namely; birth of economists, birth of the ‘’publicistes’’ known as economy and public opinion the two correlative elements of field of reality that is emerging as the direct correlate of government.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 255-283 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 163-185 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 191-226 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Salvation ==
[[Mercantilism]], according to Foucault, was the first rationalization of the exercise of power as a practice of government; it is the first time that a knowledge of the state can be employed as tactics for the state, namely statistics. Foucault begins to chart through this historical, political reasoning behind the doctrine [[raison d'État]] (reason of state). The time of the Middle Ages where the idea existed of an indefinite permanent character of political power and government. This perpetual discourse, the idea of progress in men's knowledge about themselves and towards others, however, one thing was internally missing from this analysis, namely the notion of population. Foucault traces the conceptual discourse of the populace back to the Middle Ages definition of the pastorate which to the Middle Ages mind meant salvation, obedience and truth. First of all the discourse of raison d'État and salvation; Foucault manages to trace conceptually the system of salvation through the 17th century usage of coup d'état politics. Foucault notices that entire treatise were devoted to the very notion of coup d'état, for example a text written in 1639 by [[Gabriel Naudé]], entitled ''Considerations sur les coups d'etat'' and writing in 1631 Foucault sites [[Jean Sirmond]] ''Le Coup d’Estat de Louis XIII''.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 255-283 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 280-281, notes 19, 20, 24, 26 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Swiss Ornithological Institute''''' (''Schweizerische Vogelwarte Sempach'' in [[German language|German]]) is an ornithological research centre, which is based at the town of [[Sempach]] in the district of [[Sursee (Amt)|Sursee]] in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Lucerne (canton)|Lucerne]] in [[Switzerland]]. Founded in 1924, it is a [[non-profit organization]] and the largest private field research institute in Switzerland.  It carries out a [[bird ringing|bird ringing program]] as well as other [[ornithology|ornithological]] research, [[conservation biology]], and public education.

==Bird ringing==
The Institute manages the Swiss Ringing Scheme under contract for the Swiss Agency for the Environment, Forests and Landscape, and issues bird rings inscribed “Sempach Helvetia” for use in Switzerland only.  Special projects managed by the Scheme include the Alpine ringing station “[[Col de Bretolet]]” at 1923 m [[above mean sea level|asl]] on the Swiss-French border, and the Integrated Population Monitoring Program for the [[common kestrel]] and [[barn owl]], which studies population changes and dispersal movements.

{{Sociology}}

The '''sociology of knowledge''' is the study of the relationship between human [[thought]] and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. It is not a specialized area of [[sociology]] but instead deals with broad fundamental questions about the extent and limits of social influences on individuals' lives and the social-cultural basics of our [[knowledge]] about the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stthomasu.ca/academic/soci/weeks/3523.htm|title=Sociology 3523: Sociology of Knowledge|publisher=St. Thomas University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complementary to the sociology of knowledge is the sociology of ignorance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociologyofignorance.com/ The Sociology of Ignorance]&lt;/ref&gt; including the study of nescience, ignorance, knowledge gaps, or non-knowledge as inherent features of knowledge making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The sociology of knowledge was pioneered primarily by the sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] at beginning of the 20th century. His work deals directly with how conceptual thought, language, and logic could be influenced by the sociological milieu out of which they arise. In an early work co-written with [[Marcel Mauss]], ''Primitive Classification'', Durkheim and Mauss take a study of "primitive" group mythology to argue that systems of classification are collectively based and that the divisions with these systems are derived from social categories.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Emile, and Marcel Mauss. (1963). ''Primitive classification.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Durkheim in ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'' would elaborate his theory of knowledge, examining how language and the concepts and categories (such as space and time) used in logical thought have a sociological origin. While neither Durkheim, nor Mauss, specifically coined nor used the term 'sociology of knowledge', their work is an important first contribution to the field.

The specific term 'sociology of knowledge' is said to have been in widespread use since the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking [[sociology|sociologists]], most notably [[Max Scheler]] and [[Karl Mannheim]], wrote extensively on sociological aspects of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Max Scheler (ed.). ''Versuche zu einer Soziologie des Wissens''. München und Leipzig: Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1924. Karl Mannheim. ''Ideology and utopia: an introduction to the sociology of knowledge''. Translated by Louis Wirth and Edward Shils. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company; London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; With the dominance of [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]] through the middle years of the 20th century, the sociology of knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]] in ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'' (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society  (compare ''[[socially constructed reality]]''). The 'genealogical' and 'archaeological' studies of [[Michel Foucault]] are of considerable contemporary influence.

== History ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
{{Original research|date=September 2018}}

=== The Enlightenment ===
[[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]] movement ought not to be underestimated in its influence upon the social sciences. When these philosophers worked towards a scientific analysis of society, they were engaged in a sociology of ideas and values, albeit their own commitment was to [[critical rationalism]]. The Enlightenment strove for progress, change, [[secularism]], but above all, to freedom, the freedom for individuals to decide their own fate. There was a commitment to practical science with humankind at the centre (as opposed to God or gods) and this is the real source of social science. This new science was not interested in revealed knowledge or ''a priori'' knowledge but in the workings of humanity: human practices, and social variety and regularities. Western thought, therefore, received a significant movement towards [[cultural relativism]], where [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparison]] became the dominant methodology. Importantly, social science was created by philosophers who sought to turn ideas into actions and to unite theory and practice in an attempt to restructure society as a whole.

=== Earlier viewpoints ===
Sociology of knowledge requires a certain viewpoint which was first expounded by [[Giambattista Vico]] in his ''[[The New Science|New Science]]'', written in the early 18th Century, a great deal before the first sociologists study the relationship between knowledge and society. In this book, a justification for a new historical and sociological methodology, the main point is that the natural world and the social world are known in different ways. The former is known through external or empirical methods, whilst the latter can be known internally as well as externally. In other words, human history is a construct. This creates a key epistemological distinction between the natural world and the social world which is a central concept in the social sciences. Primarily focused on [[Historicism|historical methodology]], Vico asserts that in order to study a society's history it is necessary to move beyond a chronicle of events by examining the cultural elements of the society, what was termed the "civil world". This "civil world", made up of actions, thoughts, ideas, myths, norms, religious beliefs, and institutions, is the product of the human mind. Since these elements are socially constructed, they can be better understood than the physical world, understood as it is in abstraction. Vico highlights that human nature and its products are not fixed entities and therefore necessitate a historical perspective which emphasizes the changes and developments implicit in individuals and societies. He also emphasizes the dialectical relationship between society and culture as key in this new historical perspective.

Vico's ideas, whilst permeated by his own penchant for etymology, and a theory of cyclical history (''corsi e ricorsi),'' are significant nonetheless for the underlying premise that our understanding and knowledge of social structure is dependent upon the ideas and concepts we employ and the language used. Vico, mostly unknown in his own time, was the first to establish the foundations of a sociology of knowledge even if his concepts were not necessarily picked up by later writers. There is some evidence that [[Montesquieu]] and [[Karl Marx]] had read Vico's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Capital, Book 1 part IV|last = Marx|first = Karl|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = Chapter 13, note 89 (footnote mentions Vico)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the similarities in their works are superficial, limited mainly to the overall conception of their projects, characterised by cultural relativisim and historicism.

==Schools==

===Émile Durkheim===
{{main article|Émile Durkheim}}
[[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) is credited as having been the first professor to successfully establish the field of sociology, institutionalizing a department of sociology at the Université de Bordeaux in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, Craig, Joseph Gerteis, James Moody, Steven Pfaff, Kathryn Schmidt, and Intermohan Virk. (2002). ''Classical sociological theory.'' Malden, Mass: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; While his works deal with a number of subjects, including suicide, the family, social structures, and social [[institution]]s, a large part of his work deals with the sociology of knowledge.

While publishing short articles on the subject earlier in his career (for example the essay ''De quelques formes primitives de classification'' written in 1902 with Marcel Mauss), Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 magnum opus ''[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]''. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought to understand how the concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not ''[[A priori knowledge|a priori]]''. Rather, the category of space depends on a society's social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group's social rhythm that determines our understanding of time.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, 'Conclusion,' Les formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse, Presses Universitaires de France, 5e édition, 2003 {{p.|628}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]], arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the tabula rasa empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal ''a priori'' truths (as [[Kant]] argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, 'Introduction,' Les Formes, {{p.|14-17}}, and {{p.|19-22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key elements to Durkheim's theory of knowledge is his concept of ''représentations collectives'' ([[collective representations]]), which is outlined in ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]''. ''Représentations collectives'' are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, ''représentations collectives'' are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Emile. (1964). ''The elementary forms of the religious life.'' London: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably the most important "représentation collective" is [[language]], which according to Durkheim is a product of collective action. And because language is a collective action, language contains within it a history of accumulated knowledge and experience that no individual would be capable of creating on their own. As Durkheim says, 'représentations collectives', and language in particular:
: "add to that which we can learn by our own personal experience all that wisdom and science which the group has accumulated in the course of centuries. Thinking by concepts, is not merely seeing reality on its most general side, but it is projecting a light upon the sensation which illuminates it, penetrates it and transforms it."&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, Conclusion, Section III, "Elementary Forms of Religious Life" trans. Joseph Ward Swain, p. 435 (accessed: https://web.archive.org/web/20130312023652/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41360/41360-h/41360-h.htm#Page_427)&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, language, as a social product, literally structures and shapes our experience of reality, an idea developed by later French philosophers, such as [[Michel Foucault]].

===Karl Mannheim===
{{main article|Karl Mannheim}}
The German political philosophers [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883) and [[Friedrich Engels]] (1820–1895) argued in ''Die deutsche Ideologie'' (1846, ''[[The German Ideology]]'') and elsewhere that people's [[ideology|ideologies]], including their social and political beliefs and opinions, are rooted in their [[social class|class]] interests, and more broadly in the social and economic circumstances in which they live:
: "It is men, who in developing their material inter-course, change, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking. Being is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by being" (''Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe'' 1/5).

Under the influence of this doctrine, and of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], the Hungarian-born German sociologist [[Karl Mannheim]] (1893–1947) gave impetus to the growth of the sociology of knowledge with his ''Ideologie und Utopie'' (1929, translated and extended in 1936 as ''Ideology and Utopia''), although the term had been introduced five years earlier by the co-founder of the movement, the German philosopher, phenomenologist and social theorist [[Max Scheler]] (1874–1928), in ''Versuche zu einer Soziologie des Wissens'' (1924, ''Attempts at a Sociology of Knowledge'').

Mannheim feared that this interpretation could be seen to claim that all knowledge and beliefs are the products of socio-political forces since this form of [[relativism]] is self-defeating (if it is true, then it too is merely a product of socio-political forces and has no claim to truth and no persuasive force). Mannheim believed that [[relativism]] was a strange mixture of modern and ancient beliefs in that it contained within itself a belief in an absolute truth which was true for all times and places (the ancient view most often associated with [[Plato]]) and condemned other truth claims because they could not achieve this level of objectivity (an idea gleaned from [[Marx]]). Mannheim sought to escape this problem with the idea of 'relationism'. This is the idea that certain things are true only in certain times and places (a view influenced by [[pragmatism]]) however, this does not make them less true. Mannheim felt that a stratum of free-floating intellectuals (who he claimed were only loosely anchored to the class structure of society) could most perfectly realize this form of truth by creating a "dynamic synthesis" of the ideologies of other groups.

===Phenomenological sociology===

[[Phenomenological sociology]] is the study of the formal structures of concrete social existence as made available in and through the analytical description of acts of intentional consciousness. The "object" of such an analysis is the meaningful lived world of everyday life: the "Lebenswelt", or [[life-world]] (Husserl:1889). The task, like that of every other phenomenological investigation, is to describe the formal structures of this object of investigation in subjective terms, as an object-constituted-in-and-for-consciousness (Gurwitsch:1964). That which makes such a description different from the "naive" subjective descriptions of the man in the street, or those of the traditional, positivist social scientist, is the utilization of phenomenological methods.

The leading proponent of phenomenological sociology was [[Alfred Schutz|Alfred Schütz]] (1899–1959). Schütz sought to provide a critical philosophical foundation for [[Max Weber]]'s interpretive sociology through the use of phenomenological methods derived from the transcendental phenomenological investigations of [[Edmund Husserl]] (1859–1938). Husserl's work was directed at establishing the formal structures of intentional [[consciousness]]. Schütz's work was directed at establishing the formal structures of the Life-world (Schütz:1980). Husserl's work was conducted as a transcendental phenomenology of consciousness. Schütz's work was conducted as a mundane phenomenology of the Life-world (Natanson:1974). The difference in their research projects lies at the level of analysis, the objects taken as topics of study, and the type of phenomenological reduction that is employed for the purposes of analysis.

Ultimately, the two projects should be seen as complementary, with the structures of the latter dependent on the structures of the former. That is, valid phenomenological descriptions of the formal structures of the Life-world should be wholly consistent with the descriptions of the formal structures of intentional consciousness. It is from the latter that the former derives its validity and [[truth value]] (Sokolowski:2000).

The phenomenological tie-in with the sociology of knowledge stems from two key historical sources for [[Mannheim]]'s analysis: [1] Mannheim was dependent on insights derived from Husserl's phenomenological investigations, especially the theory of meaning as found in Husserl's Logical Investigations of 1900/1901 (Husserl:2000), in the formulation of his central methodological work: "On The Interpretation of Weltanschauung" (Mannheim:1993:see fn41 &amp; fn43) – this essay forms the centerpiece for Mannheim's method of historical understanding and is central to his conception of the sociology of knowledge as a research program; and [2] The concept of "Weltanschauung" employed by Mannheim has its origins in the hermeneutic philosophy of Wilhelm Dilthey, who relied on Husserl's theory of meaning (above) for his methodological specification of the interpretive act (Mannheim: 1993: see fn38).

It is also noteworthy that Husserl's analysis of the formal structures of consciousness, and Schütz's analysis of the formal structures of the Life-world are specifically intended to establish the foundations, in consciousness, for the understanding and interpretation of a social world which is subject to cultural and historical change. The phenomenological position is that although the [[facticity]] of the social world may be culturally and historically relative, the formal structures of consciousness, and the processes by which we come to know and understand this facticity, are not. That is, the understanding of any actual social world is unavoidably dependent on understanding the structures and processes of consciousness that found, and constitute, any possible social world.

Alternatively, if the facticity of the social world ''and'' the structures of consciousness prove to be culturally and historically relative, then we are at an impasse in regard to any meaningful scientific understanding of the social world which is not subjective (as opposed to being objective and grounded in nature [positivism], or inter subjective and grounded in the structures of consciousness [phenomenology]), and relative to the cultural and idealization formations of particular concrete individuals living in a particular socio-historical group.

===Michel Foucault===
{{main article|Michel Foucault}}
A particularly important contemporary contribution to the sociology of knowledge is found in the work of Michel Foucault. ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'' (1961) postulated that conceptions of madness and what was considered "reason" or "knowledge" was itself subject to major [[culture bias]] – in this respect mirroring similar criticisms by [[Thomas Szasz]], at the time the foremost critic of [[psychiatry]], and himself now an eminent psychiatrist. A point where Foucault and Szasz agreed was that sociological processes played the major role in defining "madness" as an "illness" and prescribing "cures". In ''[[The Birth of the Clinic]]: An Archeology of Medical Perception'' (1963), Foucault extended his critique to institutional clinical medicine, arguing for the central [[conceptual metaphor]] of "[[Medical gaze|The Gaze]]", which had implications for [[medical education]], [[Prison#Prison design and facilities|prison design]], and the [[carceral state]] as understood today. Concepts of [[criminal justice]] and its intersection with medicine were better developed in this work than in Szasz and others, who confined their critique to current psychiatric practice. ''The Order of Things'' (1966) and ''The Archeology of Knowledge'' (1969) introduced abstract notions of mathesis and taxonomia to explain the subjective 'ordering' of the [[human sciences]]. These, he claimed, had transformed 17th and 18th century studies of "general grammar" into modern "[[linguistics]]", "[[natural history]]" into modern "[[biology]]", and "[[analysis of wealth]]" into modern "[[economics]]"; though not, claimed Foucault, without loss of meaning. According to Foucault, the 19th century transformed what knowledge was.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Perhaps Foucault's best-known claim{{according to whom|date=February 2012}} was that "Man did not exist" before the 18th century. Foucault regarded notions of humanity and of [[humanism]] as inventions of [[modernity]]. Accordingly, a [[cognitive bias]] had been introduced unwittingly into science, by over-trusting the individual doctor or scientist's ability to see and state things objectively. Foucault roots this argument in the rediscovery of Kant, though his thought is significantly influenced by [[Nietzsche]] – that philosopher declaring the "death of God" in the 19th century, and the [[anti-humanism|anti-humanists]] proposing the "death of Man" in the 20th.

In ''Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison'', Foucault concentrates on the correlation between [[knowledge]] and power. According to him, knowledge is a form of power and can conversely be used against individuals as a form of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish|year=1975|publisher=New York: Random House|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, knowledge is [[socially constructed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish|year=1975|publisher=New York: Random House|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that knowledge forms discourses and discourses form the dominant ideological ways of thinking which govern our lives.&lt;ref name="foucault187"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish|year=1975|publisher=New York: Random House|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him, social control is maintained in 'the disciplinary society', through codes of control over sexuality and the ideas/knowledge perpetuated through social institutions.&lt;ref name="foucault138"&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=Discipline and Punish|year=1975|publisher=New York: Random House|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, discourses and [[ideologies]] subject us to authority and turn people into 'subjected beings', who are in turn afraid of being punished if they sway from [[social norms]].&lt;ref name="foucault138"/&gt; Foucault believes that institutions overtly regulate and control our lives. Institutions such as schools reinforce the dominant ideological forms of thinking onto the populace and force us into becoming obedient and docile beings.&lt;ref name="foucault138"/&gt; Hence, the [[dominant ideology]] that serves the interests of the ruling class, all the while appearing as 'neutral', needs to be questioned and must not go unchallenged.&lt;ref name="foucault187"/&gt;

===Knowledge ecology===

===New Sociology of Knowledge===

The [[New Sociology of Knowledge]] (a postmodern approach considering knowledge as culture by drawing upon Marxist, French structuralist, and American pragmatist traditions)&lt;ref&gt;Doyle McCarthy, Knowledge as Culture: The New Sociology of Knowledge, Routledge, published October 23, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0415064972}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduces new concepts that dictate how knowledge is socialized in the modern era by new kinds of social organizations and structures.&lt;ref&gt;Swidler, A., Arditi, J. 1994. The New Sociology of Knowledge. '' Annual Review of Sociology '', 20, pp. 205-329&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, E. Doyle. 1996. '' Knowledge as Culture: The New Sociology of Knowledge ''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert K. Merton===
{{main article|Robert K. Merton}}

American sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] (1910–2003) dedicates a section of [[Social Theory and Social Structure]] (1949; revised and expanded, 1957 and 1968) to the study of the sociology of knowledge in Part III, titled ''The Sociology of Knowledge and Mass Communications''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|title=Social Theory and Social Structure|year=1957|publisher=Glencoe, IL: Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legitimation Code Theory===
[[Legitimation Code Theory]] (LCT) emerged as a framework for the study of knowledge and education and is now being used to analyse a growing range of social and cultural practices across increasingly different institutional and national contexts, both within and beyond education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legitimationcodetheory.com/publications.html Legitimation Code Theory, bibliography]&lt;/ref&gt; It is an approach that builds primary on the work of [[Basil Bernstein]] and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. It also integrates insights from sociology (including Durkheim, Marx, Weber and Foucault), [[systemic functional linguistics]], philosophy (such as [[Karl Popper]] and [[Critical realism (philosophy of perception)|critical realism]]), early cultural studies, anthropology (especially [[Mary Douglas]] and [[Ernest Gellner]]), and other approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Maton, K. (2014), ''Knowledge and Knowers: Towards a realist sociology of education'', London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maton, K., Hood, S. &amp; Shay, S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13548">The '''Strategic Environmental Assessment''' (SEA), is a process in [[Denmark]] for assessing the environmental effects of proposed government projects and programmes. Established in 1993 by an administrative order of Denmark's Prime Minister’s Office,&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton and Sadler, Strategic Environmental Assessment A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience, Earthscan, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; this requirement was not initially enshrined in law, but was supported by a [[government circular]] which required an SEA to be carried out on “government proposals with major environmental effects”.&lt;ref&gt;Therival and Partidario (1996), The Practice of Strategic Environmental Assessment, Earthscan, London, p25.&lt;/ref&gt;  The SEA process was limited only to government proposals and did not extend to plans and programmes. SEAs were required to focus on the impacts proposals would have on physical, ecological, cultural, health and [[risk factors]].&lt;ref&gt;Therival and Partidario (1996), The Practice of Strategic Environmental Assessment, Earthscan, London.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the SEA requirement was extended to new parliamentary acts in addition to government proposals at the national level.

== Initial administrative order ==

The administrative order broadly outlined four steps in the SEA process.&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton and Sadler, Strategic Environmental Assessment A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience, Earthscan, London, 2005, pg 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Screening – using the checklist contained in the guidance ([[water]], [[air]], [[climate]], surface of the earth, [[soil]], [[flora]] and [[fauna]], landscape, resources, waste, historical buildings, [[population health]], safety and transport of harmful substances) proposals that were likely to have a significant environmental impact had to be identified.

2. Scoping – the cumulative effects of a bill or policy had to be identified.

3. Assessment – analysis of the effects that had been identified as significant in the previous stages. Crucially the guidance stated that it was not possible to give an overall description, so a list of factors to be referenced were included in the guidance.

4. Report – a separate report of the environmental effects had to be included, attached to the bill that was to be put before parliament. The report had to be non-technical and easy to understand – it also had to be made available to the public.

===Legal Framework===

The SEA Directive (2001/42/EC) was integrated into the Danish planning system in 2004. The SEA Directive now ensures that SEA has been extended to plans and programmes, rather than just government proposals. The Act on the [[Environmental impact assessment|Environmental Assessment]] of Plans and Programmes (Danish SEA Act) was passed into law in May 2004 and “is strictly in accordance with the requirements of the [2001/42/EC] directive”.&lt;ref&gt;Elling cited in: Jones et al., Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London, 2005, pg66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEA Act allows the Minister for the Environment a certain amount of discretion (as the administrative order of 1993 did), with the Minister able to determine whether or not a private or [[Public ownership|publicly owned]] company is required to carry out a SEA on their plan or programme, when they are acting in the capacity of a public authority (for example, the provision of utilities).&lt;ref&gt;Elling cited in: Jones et al., Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also important to note that the SEA Act can be overruled, as long as a plan or programme complies with the procedural and substantive requirements of the SEA Directive. This helps to avoid duplication with “land use plans that have been prepared in accordance with the [Danish] Planning Act”.&lt;ref&gt;Elling cited in: Jones et al., Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London, 2005, pg66.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guidance Documents===

Despite the integration of the SEA Directive, SEA guidance was restricted to a publication called Strategic Environmental Assessment of Bills and Other Proposals: Examples and Experience issued in 1995 by the Ministry for the Environment. New guidance was prepared in 2002, but never published due to a change in government.&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton and Sadler, Strategic Environmental Assessment A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience, Earthscan, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1995 guidance issues a six step approach with regards to the type of information that should be included within an SEA&lt;ref&gt;Dalal-Clayton and Sadler, Strategic Environmental Assessment A Sourcebook and Reference Guide to International Experience, Earthscan, London, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blst.dk/Planlaegning/Miljoekonsekvenser/MiljoevurderingPlaner/, Danish Ministry for the Environment (2008), Miljøvurdering af planer og programmer (SEA Legislation &amp; Guidance), Retrieved 18/03/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Formulating the problem and describing the process of the proposal and the alternatives that have been considered
* Identifying the relevant environmental effects
* Describing the extent of the likely environmental effects
* Identifying mitigation measures and monitoring follow up programmes
* assessing and weighing the environmental effects in relation to policy objectives
* A statement with the summary of the main findings

In 2006, The Environment Ministry released up to date guidance that related to the SEA requirements for plans and programmes dating from 2004. Instruction number 9664 entitled 'Vejledning om miljøvurdering af planer og programmer' replaced the earlier guidance dating from 1995. The new guide was later supplemented, in 2007, by examples of SEAs that had been conducted.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=12953, Danish Ministry for the Environment (2008 (2)), Vejledning om miljøvurdering af planer og programmer, Retrieved 19/03/08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blst.dk/NR/rdonlyres/46372868-F4B7-4900-A743-063A553CB6E5/49265/Eksempelsamlingendeligudgave.pdf, Danish Ministry for the Environment (2008 (3)), Eksempelsamling for miljøvurdering af planer og programmer September 2007, Retrieved 19/03/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===SEA steps required===

SEA steps that are required are defined by the SEA Act and supplemented by the guidance.

The table sets out the specific SEA process as defined by 2006 and 2007 guidance from the [[Ministry of the Environment of Denmark|Danish Ministry of the Environment]]. The process is broadly split into nine main stages:

==Examples of SEAs produced so far==

Examples of Danish SEAs carried out following the introduction of [[European Union|the EU]] SEA Directive are “so far few".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danidadevforum.um.dk/en/menu/Topics/EnvironmentalSustainability/ToolsAndReferences/Guidelines/StrategicEnvironmentalAssessment/, Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (2007), Strategic Environmental Assessment, Retrieved 25/03/08.&lt;/ref&gt; Below are some examples of SEA that have been produced prior to the introduction of the EU SEA Directive.

===North Jutland Regional Development Plan (1995-1997)===

This was the very first SEA to be carried out in Denmark and was carried out before the introduction of the EU SEA Directive. As a result of this pilot SEA, the major concern amongst stakeholders was reconciling negative environmental impacts that resulted from planning activities. Overall, while stakeholders felt that no new knowledge was gained from carrying out an SEA, the planning process became more transparent. Politicians felt that there was more information on which they could make an informed decision about the choices presented to them. It was also decided that consultation should be carried out during the scoping process, rather than at later stages of the SEA process.&lt;ref&gt;Jones et al. (2005), Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional groundwater plan for Vejle County, Eastern Jutland (2002)===

This SEA was carried out as a consequence of the regional planning process (which included the requirement for SEAs) and is notable for the alternatives suggested. [[Groundwater]] extraction takes places beneath polluted [[urban area]]s and two strategies were devised – ’cleaning up’ or extracting water from rural areas. The resulting analysis found there was no clear best solution and therefore other factors, such as economic considerations, should be taken into account to aid the decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;Jones et al. (2005), Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional mineral extraction plan for Vejle County (2003)===

Extraction of minerals controlled under the plan were assessed under six criteria – transportation, economy, changes in landscape, landscape dynamics, pollution suffered by local residents and stress factors for local residents. This SEA clearly influenced the decision making process as the decision on the best alternative was deferred until suitable mitigation measures could be found.&lt;ref&gt;Jones et al. (2005), Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strengths and Weaknesses of the SEA system==

===Strengths===

Before the implementation of the SEA Directive into the Danish planning system, there had been a long history of consideration of the environmental effects that a planning process may have. Therefore, the transposition of the SEA Directive into Danish legislation conforms fully, and the supporting guidance (albeit late) ensures that SEAs conducted should be directive compliant. This historical approach has ensured that the SEA process has been institutionalised into the planning process. This ensures that environmental considerations are the subject of political debates and that parliamentary bills are prepared adequately with the SEA Directive and Danish SEA Act in mind.

The SEA process in Denmark is transparent and SEAs have a discernible influence upon the decision making process (Jones et al., 2005). There is a long tradition of public participation in the Danish planning system and this philosophy is no exception with regards to the SEA system. This is coupled with a feeling among planners and stakeholders, that despite the costs of SEA, overall it is a worthwhile and productive process.

===Weaknesses===

The major weakness in the Danish SEA system largely relates to government ministries – this is ironic given that they are responsible for the integration of the SEA Directive into Danish legislation.

* There is a lack of satisfactory scoping procedure when ministries prepare bills and conduct environmental assessments.
* There is an administrative failure of ministries excluding negative effects and including only positive effects.
* Political adaptation of environmental assessments often takes place within ministries, sometimes with the result that information on the environmental impact of bills is not submitted to Parliament.
* Further consideration should be given to how the public could play a more attentive role in the SEA process to help overcome issues of stakeholder dominance and political short-sightedness.
* The development of SEA at the plan and programme level should be monitored to evaluate its contribution on the policy level and to identify how the practice on both levels could complement and stimulate each other.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unece.org/env/eia/documents/PolicySEA/SEA%20of%20Policies%20volume.pdf, RECCEE (2005), Strategic Environmental Assessment at the Policy Level: Recent Progress, Current Status and Future Progress, Retrieved 25/03/08&lt;/ref&gt;

Monitoring systems currently in place need to be strengthened. Currently monitoring of environmental impacts is done only through informal communication instead of the Minister for the Environment issuing specific rules.&lt;ref&gt;Jones et al. (2005), Strategic Environmental Assessment and Land Use Planning: An International Evaluation, Earthscan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12715">The '''Telemann-Werke-Verzeichnis''' (Telemann Works Catalogue), abbreviated '''TWV''', is the numbering system identifying compositions by [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], published by Martin Ruhnke.

The prefix TWV is generally followed by a [[Music genre|genre]] number, a letter indicating the [[Key (music)|key]] (in some cases), and a work number. The genre number indicates the general type or medium of the work. A major key is in upper case, a minor key in lower case.  The second number is the work's number within the genre. For example, Telemann's ''Concerto polonois in B flat major for strings and basso continuo'' is TWV 43:B3. His ''Orchestral suite in D major'' is TWV 55:D18, and his ''Overture in G minor'' is TWV 55:g4.

Vocal works were catalogued in a similar way by Werner Menke in the '''Telemann-Vokalwerke-Verzeichnis''' (Telemann Vocal Works Catalogue), abbreviated '''TVWV'''. For example, Telemann's ''Johannes-Passion'' is TVWV 5:42. His ''Times of the Day'' cantata is TVWV 20:39.

==Genre numbering==

Genres of vocal works are numbered from 1 to 25, and usually prefixed by TVWV. Genres of instrumental works are numbered from 30 to 55.

The genres are numbered as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Klassika, [http://www.klassika.info/Komponisten/Telemann/wv_wvz1.html "Georg Philipp Telemann (1681–1767) Works sorted by TWV (Telemann-Werke-Verzeichnis)"] (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TheMindOfTheMaker.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]])&lt;br&gt;Cover art by C W B]]

'''''The Mind of the Maker''''' (1941) is a Christian [[Theology|theological]] book, written by [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] (who was better known for her crime and mystery novels and other fiction, particularly for the character [[Lord Peter Wimsey]]). It used the experience she had of literary creativity to illuminate Christian doctrine about the nature of [[Doctrine of the Trinity|the Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Mind of the Maker'', preface&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has a Latin dedication to Saint [[Athanasius]] and to British Christian leaders.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Regarded in the [[Christian world]] as something of a classic, it is often quoted.
:''"In The Mind of the Maker, one of her most profound works, Sayers contends that the creative process in art works in ways that correspond to the dynamic relation among the three Persons of the Trinity in Christian theology — and that the activity of one illuminates the activity of the other."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=In God’s Image: The virtue of creativity | last=Wolfe | first=Gregory | work=National Review online | url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/wolfe200505270758.asp | date=27 May 2005 | accessdate=2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprisingly well received, Sayers' work even finds readers beyond the religious world, such as in the software management book ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]''.
:''"Dorothy Sayers, in her excellent book, The Mind of the Maker, divides creative activity into three stages: the idea, the implementation, and the interaction. A book, then, or a computer, or a program comes into existence first as an ideal construct, built outside time and space, but complete in the mind of the author. It is realized in time and space, by pen, ink, and paper, or by wire, silicon, and ferrite. The creation is complete when someone reads the book, uses the computer, or runs the program, thereby interacting with the mind of the maker. This description, which Miss Sayers uses to illuminate not only human creative activity but also the Christian doctrine of the Trinity, will help us in our present task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering | last=Brookes | first=Frederick P. jr. | work= | url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/4468/The-Mythical-ManMonth-Essays-on-Software-Engineering-20th-Anniversary-Ed-1995- | date=1975 | accessdate=2007-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Rottenhammer - Allegory of the Arts - WGA20147.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Rottenhammer]], ''Allegory of the Arts'' (second half of the 16th century). [[Gemäldegalerie]], Berlin.]]

'''The arts''' refers to the [[Aesthetics|theory]] and [[Art|physical expression]] of [[creativity]] found in human [[Society|societies]] and [[culture]]s. Major constituents of the arts include [[literature]] (including [[drama]], [[poetry]], and [[prose]]), [[performing arts]] (among them [[dance]], [[music]], and [[theatre]]), and [[visual arts]] (including [[architecture]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[photography]], and [[sculpting]]). {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Some art forms combine a visual element with performance (e.g., [[cinematography]]) or artwork with  the written word (e.g., [[comics]]). From prehistoric [[cave paintings]] to modern day [[films]], art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying humankind's relationship with the environment.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Definitions==
In its most basic abstract definition, art is a documented expression of a sentient being through or on an accessible medium so that anyone can view, hear or experience it. The act itself of producing an expression can also be referred to as a certain art, or as art in general. If this solidified expression, or the act of producing it, is "good" or has value depends on those who access and rate it and this public rating is dependent on various subjective factors. [[Merriam-Webster]] defines "the arts" as "painting, sculpture, music, theatre, literature, etc., considered as a group of activities done by people with skill and imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/the%20arts|title=Definition of The Arts|work=Merriam-Webster|language=en|access-date=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[United States Congress]], in the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, defined "the arts" as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.csulb.edu/~jvancamp/361_r8.html|title=Congressional definition of "the arts"|last=Van Camp|first=Julie|date=22 November 2006|website=PHIL 361I: Philosophy of Art|publisher=California State University, Long Beach|language=en|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The term 'the arts' includes, but is not limited to, music (instrumental and vocal), dance, drama, folk art, creative writing, architecture and allied fields, painting, sculpture, photography, graphic and craft arts, industrial design, costume and fashion design, motion pictures, television, radio, film, video, tape and sound recording, the arts related to the presentation, performance, execution, and exhibition of such major art forms, all those traditional arts practiced by the diverse peoples of this country. (sic) and the study and application of the arts to the human environment.}}

==History==
{{main article|History of art}}

In [[Ancient Greece]], all art and craft was referred to by the same word, ''[[techne]]''. Thus, there was no distinction among the arts. [[Ancient Greek]] art brought the veneration of the animal form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions. [[Roman Empire|Ancient Roman]] art depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g. [[Zeus]]' thunderbolt). In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Gothic art]] of the [[Middle Ages]], the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths. [[Eastern art]] has generally worked in a style akin to Western medieval art, namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour (meaning the plain colour of an object, such as basic red for a red robe, rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light, shade and reflection). A characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline (a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon). This is evident in, for example, the art of [[Indian art|India]], [[Tibetan art|Tibet]] and [[Japanese art|Japan]]. Religious [[Islamic art|Islamic]] art forbids iconography, and expresses religious ideas through geometry instead.

The arts have also been classified as seven: [[painting]], [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[performing]] and [[Film|cinema]].

===Architecture===
{{Main article|Architecture}}
[[File:Ac.parthenon5.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]] on top of the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], [[Athens]], [[Greece]]]]

Architecture is the [[art]] and [[science]] of [[design]]ing [[building]]s and [[structure]]s. The word ''architecture'' comes from the Greek ''arkhitekton'', "master builder, director of works," from ''αρχι-'' (arkhi) "chief" + ''τεκτων'' (tekton) "builder, carpenter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=architect&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=architect (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wider definition would include the design of the built environment, from the macrolevel of [[town planning]], [[urban design]], and [[landscape architecture]] to the microlevel of creating [[furniture]]. Architectural design usually must address both feasibility and [[cost]] for the [[Construction|builder]], as well as function and [[aesthetics]] for the [[Consumer|user]].

[[File:Table of architecture, Cyclopaedia, 1728, volume 1.jpg|thumb|Table of architecture, ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'', 1728]]

In modern usage, architecture is the [[art]] and [[discipline]] of creating, or inferring an implied or apparent plan of, a complex object or [[system]]. The term can be used to connote the ''implied architecture'' of abstract things such as [[music]] or [[mathematics]], the ''apparent architecture'' of natural things, such as [[geology|geological]] formations or the [[structural biology|structure of biological cells]], or explicitly ''planned architectures'' of human-made things such as [[software]], [[computers]], [[Enterprise architecture|enterprises]], and [[database]]s, in addition to buildings. In every usage, an architecture may be seen as a ''subjective [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]]'' from a human perspective (that of the ''user'' in the case of abstract or physical artifacts) to the [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] or components of some kind of [[structure]] or system, which preserves the relationships among the elements or components. Planned architecture manipulates space, volume, texture, light, shadow, or abstract elements in order to achieve pleasing [[aesthetics]]. This distinguishes it from [[applied science]] or [[engineering]], which usually concentrate more on the functional and feasibility aspects of the design of constructions or structures.

In the field of building architecture, the skills demanded of an architect range from the more complex, such as for a [[hospital]] or a [[stadium]], to the apparently simpler, such as planning [[residential]] houses. Many architectural works may be seen also as cultural and political [[symbol]]s, or works of art. The role of the architect, though changing, has been central to the successful (and sometimes less than successful) design and implementation of pleasingly built environments in which people live.

=== Ceramics ===
{{Main article|Ceramic art}}

Ceramic art is art made from [[ceramic]] materials (including [[clay]]), which may take forms such as [[pottery]], [[tile]], [[figurine]]s, [[sculpture]], and [[tableware]]. While some ceramic products are considered [[fine art]], some are considered to be [[Decorative arts|decorative]], [[Industrial design|industrial]], or [[Applied arts|applied]] art objects. Ceramics may also be considered [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] in [[archaeology]].Ceramic art can be made by one person or by a group of people. In a pottery or ceramic factory, a group of people design, manufacture, and decorate the pottery. Products from a pottery are sometimes referred to as "art pottery." In a one-person pottery studio, ceramists or potters produce [[studio pottery]]. In modern ceramic engineering usage, "ceramics" is the art and science of making objects from inorganic, non-metallic materials by the action of heat. It excludes [[glass]] and [[mosaic]] made from glass ''[[tessera]]e.''

===Conceptual art===
{{Main article|Conceptual art}}

Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work takes precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns.
The inception of the term in the 1960s referred to a strict and focused practice of idea-based art that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/c/conceptual-art|title=Conceptual art|publisher=Tate|access-date=14 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its association with the [[Young British Artists]] and the [[Turner Prize]] during the 1990s,{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} its popular usage, particularly in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], developed as a synonym for all [[contemporary art]] that does not practise the traditional skills of [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].

===Drawing===
{{Main article|Drawing}}

Drawing is a means of making an [[image]], using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques. It generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool, or moving a tool across a surface. Common tools are [[graphite]] [[pencil]]s, [[Pen|pen and ink]], [[ink]]ed [[brush]]es, wax [[color pencil|colour pencils]], [[crayon]]s, [[charcoal]]s, [[pastel]]s, and [[marker pen|markers]]. Digital tools which can simulate the effects of these are also used. The main techniques used in drawing are line drawing, [[hatching]], crosshatching, random hatching, scribbling, [[stippling]], and blending. An [[artist]] who excels in drawing is referred to as a ''drafter'', ''draftswoman'', or ''draughtsman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/draftsman|title=The definition of draftsman|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing can be used to create art used in cultural industries such as [[illustration]]s, [[comics]] and [[animation]].

===Painting===
{{Main article|Painting}}

[[File:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], is one of the most recognizable artistic paintings in the [[Western world]].]]

Painting is a mode of creative expression, and can be done in numerous forms. [[Drawing]], [[gesture]] (as in [[gestural painting]]), [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], [[narrative|narration]] (as in [[narrative art]]), or [[abstraction]] (as in [[abstract art]]), among other aesthetic modes, may serve to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perry|first1=Lincoln|title=The Music of Painting|journal=The American Scholar|date=Summer 2014|volume=83|issue=3|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in a [[still life]] or [[landscape art|landscape painting]]), [[Photorealism|photographic]], abstract, narrative, [[symbol]]istic (as in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist art]]), [[emotion|emotive]] (as in [[Expressionism]]), or [[Politics|political]] in nature (as in [[Artivism]]).

Modern painters have extended the practice considerably to include, for example, [[collage]]. Collage is not painting in the strict sense since it includes other materials. Some modern painters incorporate different materials such as [[sand]], [[cement]], [[straw]], [[wood]] or strands of hair for their [[Texture (painting)|artwork texture]]. Examples of this are the works of [[Elito Circa]], [[Jean Dubuffet]] or [[Anselm Kiefer]].

===Photography===
{{Main article|Fine art photography}}

Photography as an art form refers to photographs that are created in accordance with the creative vision of the photographer. Art photography stands in contrast to [[photojournalism]], which provides a visual account for news events, and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products or services.

===Sculpture===
{{Main article|Sculpture}}

'''Sculpture''' is the branch of the [[visual arts]] that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the [[plastic arts]]. Durable sculptural processes originally used [[carving]] (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in [[stone]], [[metal]], [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wood]] and other materials; but since [[modernism]], shifts in sculptural process led to an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by [[welding]] or modelling, or [[Molding (process)|moulded]], or [[Casting|cast]].

==Literary arts==
{{Main article|Language|Literature}}
{{Listen|filename=Sonnet18.ogg|title=Sonnet 18|description= '''''[[Sonnet 18]]''''' by [[William Shakespeare]] part of the Fair Youth [[Sonnet sequence|sequence]] of [[sonnet]]s.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Literature is literally "acquaintance with letters" as in the first sense given in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. The noun "literature" comes from the [[Latin]] word ''littera'' meaning "an individual written character ([[Letter (alphabet)|letter]])." The term has generally come to identify a collection of [[writing]]s, which in Western culture are mainly [[prose]] (both [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]]), [[drama]] and [[poetry]]. In much, if not all of the world, the artistic linguistic expression can be [[oral literature|oral]] as well, and include such [[genre]]s as [[Epic poetry|epic]], [[legend]], [[Mythology|myth]], [[ballad]], other forms of oral [[poetry]], and as [[Folklore|folktale]]. [[Comics]], the combination of drawings or other visual arts with narrating literature, are often called the "[[ninth art]]" (le neuvième art) in Francophone scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reading bande dessinée : critical approaches to French-language comic strip|last=Miller|first=Ann|year=2007|isbn=9781841501772|oclc=939254581|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performing arts==
{{Main article|Performing arts}}

Performing arts comprise [[dance]], [[music]], [[theatre]], [[opera]], [[mime]], and other art forms in which a human performance is the principal product. Performing arts are distinguished by this performance element in contrast with disciplines such as visual and literary arts where the product is an object that does not require a performance to be observed and experienced. Each discipline in the performing arts is temporal in nature, meaning the product is performed over a period of time. Products are broadly categorized as being either repeatable (for example, by script or score) or improvised for each performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford companion to philosophy|last=Honderich|first=Ted|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|isbn=9780199264797|oclc=180031201|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199264797.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called ''performers'', including [[actor]]s, [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]], [[comedian]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[musician]]s, and [[singer]]s. Performing arts are also supported by the services of other artists or essential workers, such as [[songwriting]] and [[stagecraft]]. Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;with tools such as [[costume]] and [[Theatrical makeup|stage makeup]].

===Music===
{{Main article|Music}}
[[File:MozartExcerptK331.svg|thumb|A musical score by [[Mozart]]. {{audio|MozartExcerptK331.mid|Play}}]]

Music is an art form whose [[Media (arts)|medium]] is sound and silence, occurring in time. Common elements of music are [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs melody and harmony), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts tempo, metre, and articulation), dynamics, and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]]. The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions (and their reproduction in performance) through improvisational music to [[Aleatoric music|aleatoric pieces]]. Music can be divided into genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. Within "the arts," music may be classified as a [[performing art]], a [[fine art]], and [[auditory art]].

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Theatre}}

Theatre or theater (from Greek ''theatron'' (''θέατρον)''; from ''theasthai'', "behold")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=theater&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=theater (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the branch of the [[performing arts]] concerned with [[acting]] out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle – indeed, any one or more elements of the other performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style, theatre takes such forms as [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[kabuki]], [[classical Indian dance]], [[Chinese opera]] and [[Mummers Play|mummers' plays]].

===Dance===
[[File:Ballroom dance exhibition.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[ballroom]] dance exhibition]]
{{Main article|Dance}}

[[Dance]] (from [[Old French]] ''dancier'', of unknown origin)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dance&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=dance (n.)|last=Harper|first=Douglas|date=2001–2016|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; generally refers to human [[Motion (physics)|movement]] either used as a form of expression or presented in a [[social]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting. ''Dance'' is also used to describe methods of [[non-verbal communication]] (see [[body language]]) between humans or [[animal]]s (e.g. [[Bee Dance language|bee dance]], [[Courtship display|mating dance]]), [[Motion (physics)|motion]] in inanimate objects (e.g. ''the leaves danced in the wind''), and certain [[dance (music)|musical forms]] or [[music|genres]]. [[Choreography]] is the art of making dances, and the person who does this is called a choreographer. Definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]], [[artistic]] and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[Folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]]. In [[sport]]s, [[gymnastics]], [[figure skating]] and [[synchronized swimming]] are dance disciplines while [[Martial arts]] "[[Kata (martial arts)|kata]]" are often compared to dances.

==Multidisciplinary artistic works==
Areas exist in which artistic works incorporate multiple artistic fields, such as [[film]], [[opera]] and [[Performance Art|performance art]]. While opera is often categorized in the performing arts of music, the word itself is Italian for "works", because opera combines several artistic disciplines in a singular artistic experience. In a typical traditional [[opera]], the entire work utilizes the following: the sets (visual arts), costumes (fashion), acting (dramatic performing arts), the libretto, or the words/story (literature), and singers and an orchestra (music). [[File:Ernestine Schumann-Heink as Waltraute.png|thumb|left|Ernestine Schumann-Heink as Waltraute]]The composer [[Richard Wagner]] recognized the fusion of so many disciplines into a single work of opera, exemplified by his cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' ("The Ring of the Nibelung"). He did not use the term opera for his works, but instead [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] ("synthesis of the arts"), sometimes referred to as "Music Drama" in [[English language|English]], emphasizing the literary and theatrical components which were as important as the music. Classical [[ballet]] is another form which emerged in the 17th century in which orchestral music is combined with dance.

Other works in the late 19th, 20th and 21st centuries have fused other disciplines in unique and creative ways, such as [[Performance Art|performance art]]. Performance art is a performance over time which combines any number of instruments, objects, and art within a predefined or less well-defined structure, some of which can be improvised. Performance art may be scripted, unscripted, random or carefully organized; even audience participation may occur. [[John Cage]] is regarded by many as a performance artist rather than a composer, although he preferred the latter term. He did not compose for traditional ensembles. Cage's composition ''[[Living Room Music]]'' composed in 1940 is a "quartet" for unspecified instruments, really non-melodic objects, which can be found in a living room of a typical house, hence the title.

==Other arts==
There is no clear line between art and [[culture]].  Cultural fields like [[gastronomy]] are sometimes considered as arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/new-face-french-gastronomy/ |title=The New Face of French Gastronomy - Knowledge@Wharton |publisher=Knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied arts===
{{Main article|Applied arts}}
The applied arts are the application of design and decoration to everyday, functional, objects to make them aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref&gt;"applied art" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art''. Online edition. [[Oxford University Press]], 2004. www.oxfordreference.com. Retrieved 23 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The applied arts includes fields such as industrial design, illustration, and commercial art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/applied-art |title=Applied art &amp;#124; Define Applied art at |publisher=Dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "applied art" is used in distinction to the fine arts, where the latter is defined as arts that aims to produce objects which are beautiful or provide intellectual stimulation but have no primary everyday function. In practice, the two often overlap.

===Video games===
{{See also|Video games as an art form}}
A debate exists in the fine arts and [[video game culture]]s over whether video games can be counted as an art form.&lt;ref name="an-art-world-for-artgames"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=12 December 2012|title=An Art World for Artgames|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/loading/index.php/loading/article/viewArticle/119|last=Parker|first=Felan|journal=Loading...|language=en|volume=7|issue=11|issn=1923-2691}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game designer [[Hideo Kojima]] professes that video games are a type of service, not an art form, because they are meant to entertain and attempt to entertain as many people as possible, rather than being a single artistic voice (despite Kojima himself being considered a gaming auteur, and the mixed opinions his games typically receive). However, he acknowledged that since video games are made up of artistic elements (for example, the visuals), game designers could be considered museum curators – not creating artistic pieces, but arranging them in a way that displays their artistry and sells tickets.

Within social sciences, cultural economists show how video games playing is conducive to the involvement in more traditional art forms and cultural practices, which suggests the complementarity between video games and the arts.&lt;ref name="video-games-and-arts"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015|title=Video Games Playing: A substitute for cultural consumptions?|last1=Borowiecki|first1=Karol J.|last2=Prieto-Rodriguez|first2=Juan|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|language=en|volume=39|issue=3|pages=239–258|doi=10.1007/s10824-014-9229-y|citeseerx=10.1.1.676.2381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the [[National Endowment of the Arts]] included video games in its redefinition of what is considered a "work of art" when applying of a grant.{{fact|date=October 2018}} In 2012, the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] presented an exhibit, ''The Art of the Video Game''.&lt;ref name="an-art-world-for-artgames" /&gt; Reviews of the exhibit were mixed, including questioning whether video games belong in an art museum.

The '''UCL Institute of Archaeology''' is an academic department of the Social &amp; Historical Sciences Faculty of [[University College London]] (UCL), England which it joined in 1986. It is currently one of the largest centres for the study of [[archaeology]], [[cultural heritage]] and [[museum studies]] in the world, with over 100 members of staff and 600 students housed in a 1950s building on the north side of [[Gordon Square]] in the [[Bloomsbury]] area of Central London.

==History==
The history of the Institute of Archaeology goes back to [[Mortimer Wheeler]]'s vision of creating a centre for archaeological training in Britain, which he conceived in the 1920s. Thanks to the efforts of Wheeler and his wife [[Tessa Wheeler|Tessa]], his ambitions were realised when the Institute was officially opened in 1937, with Mortimer Wheeler as its first director. Among its early members of staff were some of the founding ancestors of archaeology in Britain. Foremost among these, apart from Wheeler himself, was [[V. Gordon Childe]], director from 1946 to 1957, but there were many others, including [[Kathleen Kenyon]], excavator of Jericho, initially secretary then the Institute's acting director during World War II; [[F. E. Zeuner]], one of the founders of quaternary studies and of zooarchaeology; [[Joan du Plat Taylor]], the Institute's librarian for many years, who was a pioneer of underwater archaeology; and [[Max Mallowan]], Professor of Western Asiatic Archaeology (and second husband of [[Agatha Christie]]).  
Mortimer Wheeler formally resigned as Honorary Director in 1944 when he became Director-General of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] and, at the end of the Second World War, the Directorship was awarded to [[V. Gordon Childe]]. Following Childe's retirement, this role passed to [[W. F. Grimes]], like Wheeler a former Director of the London Museum, and best known today for his 1954 excavation of the [[London Mithraeum]]. Following Grimes, the Directorship has been held by the Mediterranean prehistorian [[John Davies Evans]]; the geographer [[David R. Harris]]; [[Peter Ucko]], founder of the [[World Archaeological Congress]] and the prehistorian and evolutionary theorist [[Stephen Shennan]]. It is currently held by prehistorian [[Sue Hamilton (archaeologist)|Sue Hamilton]]. Initially the Institute was based in St John's Lodge, Regent's Park, London, but in 1958 it moved into its purpose-built new premises in [[Gordon Square]]. 2012 marked the Institute's 75th anniversary and a number of events and activities were held to mark this occasion.

'''Vietnam National University of Forestry''' (VNUF) was established according to the Decision No.127/CP dated on August 19, 1964 by the [[Prime Minister of Vietnam]].

Currently, there are over 16.000 students, including undergraduate and graduate, following 22 disciplines of undergraduate level, 6 majors of master level, and 4 majors of doctorate level.
The main campus of VNUF is located in Xuan Mai Town, [[Chương_Mỹ_District|Chuong My District]], [[Hanoi_Capital_Region|Hanoi Capital]]. The second campus (established in 01/2008) is located in [[Trảng_Bom_District|Trang Bom Town]], [[Đồng_Nai_Province|Dong Nai Province]].

==History==
Historical background:
Vietnam National University of Forestry (VNUF) was established according to the Decision No.127/CP dated on August 19, 1964 by the Prime Minister of Vietnam, and was separated from the Forestry Department - [[Vietnam_National_University_of_Agriculture|Hanoi University of Agriculture]].
From 1964 to 1984: The first campus of VNUF was located in the evacuated area of [[Đông_Triều_District|Dong Trieu] district], [[Quảng_Ninh_Province|Quang Ninh province]]. The task of VNUF was to train and provide human resources of undergraduate with three academic faculties and four majors of forestry.
From 1984 until now: The main campus was located at Xuan Mai town, Chuong My district, Hanoi, becoming a university with diversified training and education activities to meet social needs and to fulfill the duty of national scientific technology
The second campus (established in 01/2008) is located in Trang Bong Town, Dong Nai province, [[Vietnam]] that was upgraded from the Forestry College 2 - [[Ministry_of_Agriculture_and_Rural_Development_(Vietnam)|Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development]] to meet the demand for human resources in forestry for the southern provinces of the country.
Today VNUF activities expanded to five Academic Faculties with hundreds departments, 36 major subjects.
Over the years, more than 1,000 masters, 150 doctors, over 10,000 undergraduate students, and 500 trainees with intermediate and primary level have graduated from VNUF. 
Likewise, the VNUF has helped establish more than 30 universities, training and research institutions in different countries, as well as international organizations.

==Facilities==

VNUF has 160 hectares in the main campus and 20 hectares in the second branch for serving its training and science research purposes.

'''Viral metagenomics''' is the study of viral genetic material sourced directly from the environment rather than from a host or natural reservoir. The goal is to ascertain viral diversity in the environment that is often missed in studies targeting specific potential reservoirs. It reveals important information on [[virus]] evolution and the [[genetic diversity]] of the viral community without the need for isolating [[viral species]] and cultivating them in the laboratory. With the new available techniques that exploit [[Next-generation sequencing|NGS]], it was possible to study the [[virome]] of some ecosystems, even if the analysis has still some issues, in particular for the lack of universal markers. Some of the first metagenomic studies of viruses were done with ocean samples, and revealed that most of the sequences of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] viruses had no matches in databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Angly FE, Felts B, Breitbart M, Salamon P, Edwards RA, Carlson C, Chan AM, Haynes M, Kelley S, Liu H, Mahaffy JM, Mueller JE, Nulton J, Olson R, Parsons R, Rayhawk S, Suttle CA, Rohwer F|date=2006|title=The marine viromes of four oceanic regions|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=4|issue=11|page=e368|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040368|pmc=1634881|pmid=17090214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Culley|first1=A.

== The Global Virome Project ==
The aim of the Global Virome Project is to expand the viral discovery to reduce the risk of harm for new viral large-scale outbreak. It is centered on the massive collection and sequencing of the majority of the planet’s unknown viruses. In fact, it was estimated that between 631,000 to 827,000 yet-to-be-discovered viral species in animal reservoirs (as mammal and bird host) are estimated to have a [[Zoonosis|zoonotic potential]]. Total transparency of the data acquired, and the correlated possible development of some medical products (vaccine) are two main benefits of this project.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Dennis|last2=Daszak|first2=Peter|last3=Wolfe|first3=Nathan D.|last4=Gao|first4=George F.|last5=Morel|first5=Carlos M.|last6=Morzaria|first6=Subhash|last7=Pablos-Méndez|first7=Ariel|last8=Tomori|first8=Oyewale|last9=Mazet|first9=Jonna A. K.|date=2018-02-23|title=The Global Virome Project|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6378/872|journal=Science|language=en|volume=359|issue=6378|pages=872–874|doi=10.1126/science.aap7463|issn=0036-8075|pmid=29472471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main limit of this project is the cost. To analyse the majority of viruses with a zoonotic potential, the total cost has been estimated around $1.2 billion. Another GVP’s aim is also to improve the possibility to detect with low cost sequencing viruses also in developing countries in order to avoid possible outbreaks''.'' For a worldwide sample collection some network between different agencies and nations must be created. For example, the USAID (agency for international development) EPT (Emerging Pandemic Threats) PREDICT project is included in this plan and it is focused on the study of the biology of some dangerous viruses, such as [[Ebola virus|Ebola]], [[Lassa fever]], [[Rift Valley fever]] and [[avian influenza]]. PREDICT project was founded also to discover new viral species in the animal reservoir host and individuate the main characteristics that can cause the viral transmission to human, to avoid the viral outbreak in the population. Next-generation sequencing can help the massive sequencing of this viral genome samples collected, allowing the increase of speed and efficiency and moreover reducing the cost of sequencing. To validate the possibility for these new-discovered viruses to be transmitted from animal to human, new approaches must be developed for the study of their [[Pathogenicity factor|pathogenicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Charles|date=2018-10-11|title=The virome hunters|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4268|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=En|volume=36|issue=10|pages=916–919|doi=10.1038/nbt.4268|issn=1087-0156|pmid=30307913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Virome Project could help the current pandemic surveillance, diagnosis techniques and prevention strategies, as far as helping for pre-emptive production of vaccine and other countermeasures for candidate high-risk viruses. Another benefit of this research could be a deeper comprehension of the viral biology. Its discovers can be applied not only for medical need, but also in other field as the agricultural and food one, for example to enhance biosecurity of food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Methods ==
=== Metagenomic approach ===
It is used to sequence all the microbial genomes in a sample by using the [[Shotgun sequencing|Shotgun]] approach. Its aim is to identify all the genes present in the sample, mainly in order to provide information about drug-resistance. The sensitivity of this method is affected by the presence of contaminating nucleic acids from the host and other microorganisms. This method has been used for the sequencing of viruses like [[Epstein–Barr virus|Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV) and [[Hepatitis C|HCV]]. It may be used also to inform about cancer evolution and integrated virus genomes in cases of virus-associated cancers. This method requires a low number of [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] cycles, so the consequent risk of contamination is decreased. Although no primers or probes are required, the cost to obtain enough data is high.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houldcroft|first=Charlotte J.|last2=Beale|first2=Mathew A.|last3=Breuer|first3=Judith|date=2017-01-16|title=Clinical and biological insights from viral genome sequencing|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro.2016.182|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|language=En|volume=15|issue=3|pages=183–192|doi=10.1038/nrmicro.2016.182|issn=1740-1526|pmid=28090077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PCR amplicon enrichment ===
Its aim is to identify the organism and in order to do that, it enriches a portion of the genome of the virus before sequencing. For the amplification it uses specific primers for a highly-conserved target sequence. This method has been used to track Ebola virus and [[Zika virus]] during their outbreaks or to sequence the whole genome of [[Human cytomegalovirus|HCMV]]. Another possible application is the monitoring of mutations associated to drug-resistance in order to administer the more efficient drug to the patient. Although this method is cheaper than the metagenomic approach and has a great specificity and sensitivity, it has some limits: it requires many PCR cycles so it can introduce mutations and contaminants and the primers may be subjected to mismatches.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Target enrichment ===
It is an overlapping PCR method. It doesn’t require a culture step because it sequences the whole viral genome directly from the clinical sample. Small [[Oligonucleotide|oligonucleotides]], complementary to the target, are used as probes for a [[Hybridization assay|hybridization]] reaction. The probes can be bound to a solid phase or to [[Magnetic bead|magnetic beads]] in liquid phase. Capture is followed by a small number of PCR cycles and Shotgun sequencing. This method can be used to compare the genome of healthy cells and of tumoral cells in cases of virus-associated cancer. It has been used to characterize HCV, [[Hsv 1|HSV-1]], HCMV and other viruses. The presence of overlapping probes increases the tolerance for primer mismatches but their design requires high cost and time so a rapid response is limited. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Developing an imaginary setting with coherent qualities such as a [[history]], [[Fictional geography|geography]], and [[ecology]] is a key task for many science fiction or [[fantasy]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Brian M. |last=Stableford |year=2004 |title=Historical Dictionary of Science Fiction |publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=0-8108-4938-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldbuilding often involves the creation of [[Fantasy map|map]]s, a [[backstory]], and people for the world.  Constructed worlds can enrich the backstory and history of fictional works, and it is not uncommon for authors to revise their constructed worlds while completing its associated work. Constructed worlds can be created for personal amusement and [[Cognitive training|mental exercise]], or for specific creative endeavors such as [[novel]]s, [[video game]]s, or [[role-playing game]]s.

== Etymology ==
The term "world-building" was first used in the ''Edinburgh Review'' in December 1820&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | World}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in A.S. Eddington's ''Space Time and Gravitation: An Outline of the General Relativity Theory'' (1920) to describe the thinking out of hypothetical worlds with different physical laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddington|first1=Arthur Stanley|title=Space, Time and Gravitation : an outline of the general relativity theory|date=1920|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/spacetimegravita00eddirich}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used in [[science fiction]] and fantasy criticism since appearing in R.A. Lupoff’s ''Edgar Rice Burroughs: Master of Adventure'' (1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780199891405|title=Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction|editor=Jeff Prucher|page=270|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The creation of literary fictional worlds was first examined by fantasy authors such as [[George MacDonald]], [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], and [[C. S. Lewis]].&lt;ref name="MarkWolf"&gt;{{cite book|title=Building Imaginary Worlds: The Theory and History of Subcreation|author=Mark J.P. Wolf|isbn=9781136220814|publisher=Routledge|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien addressed the issue in his essay ''On Fairy Stories'', where he stated that the "Secondary World" or "Sub-Creation" (the constructed world) is substantially different from the art of play-writing: "Very little about trees as trees can be got into a play."&lt;ref name="OnFairyStories"&gt;{{citation|title=On Fairy Stories|author=J. R. R. Tolkien|work=The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays|editor=Christopher Tolkien|pp=109–161|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed worlds shift away from storytelling, narrative, characters and figures, and may explore "trees as trees" or aspects of the world in-and-of-themselves. Later analysis of fantasy worlds in the 1960s contextualized them in the medium or the narrative of the works, offering an analysis of the stories in the world, but not the world itself. [[Media franchise]]s are similar to constructed worlds but do not necessarily rely on them; for example a media franchise such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' has a constructed world, while [[The Beatles]], as a franchise, does not. In the 2000s, world-building in film has increased in popularity. When before, writers sought to create a character that could sustain multiple stories, now they create a world that can sustain multiple characters and stories.&lt;ref name="MarkWolf" /&gt;

==Methods==
Worldbuilding can be designed from [[Top-down and bottom-up design|the top down or the bottom up]], or by a combination of these approaches. The official world-building guidelines for ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' refer to these terms as "outside-in" and "inside-out", respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first1=Monte |last1=Cook |authorlink1=Monte Cook |first2=Jonathan |last2=Tweet |authorlink2=Jonathan Tweet |first3=Skip |last3=Williams |authorlink3=Skip Williams |others=revised by [[David Noonan (game designer)|David Noonan]] and [[Rich Redman]] |year=2003 |title=[[Dungeon Master's Guide]] |publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] |isbn=0-7869-2889-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the top-down approach, the [[designer]] first creates a general overview of the world, determining broad characteristics such as the world's inhabitants, [[technology]] level, major geographic features, [[climate]], and history. From there, he or she develops the rest of the world in increasing detail. This approach might involve creation of the world's basics, followed by levels such as [[continent]]s, [[civilization]]s, [[Fictional country|nation]]s, [[Fictional city|cities]], and [[town]]s. A world constructed from the top down tends to be well-integrated, with individual components fitting together appropriately. It can, however, require considerable work before enough detail is completed for the setting to be useful, such as in the setting of a story.

With the bottom-up approach, the designer focuses on a small part of the world needed for his or her purposes. This location is given considerable detail, such as local geography, [[culture]], [[social structure]], [[government]], [[politics]], [[commerce]], and history. Prominent local individuals may be described, including their [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] to each other. The surrounding areas are then described in a lower level of detail, with description growing more general with increasing distance from the initial location. The designer can subsequently enhance the description of other areas in the world. This approach provides for almost immediate applicability of the setting, with details pertinent to a certain story or situation. The approach can yield a world plagued with [[Consistency|inconsistencies]], however. By combining the top-down and bottom-up approaches, a designer can enjoy the benefits of both. This is very hard to accomplish, however, because the need to start from both sides creates twice as much work, which may delay the desired product.

Despite requiring considerable work to develop enough detail for a setting to be useful, not every aspect of a setting can be explored, and instead an approach called inferred world building is often used. Inferred world building is when the author provides enough detail about the various parts of a setting that readers can extrapolate on what is written to come to their own conclusions regarding specific details that weren't provided. This is especially useful for roleplaying game settings, as individual games may require certain details to be created on a case-by-case basis for the RPG's story to function.

==Elements==
From a game-design perspective, the goal of worldbuilding is to create the context for a story. Consistency is an important element, since the world provides a foundation for the action of a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Francois Dominic |last=Laramee |year=2002 |title=Game design perspectives |publisher=Charles River Media |isbn=1-58450-090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, J. R. R. Tolkien described the goal of worldbuilding as creating immersion, or "enchantment" as he put it, and descriptions of the world can be wholly disconnected from the story and narrative.&lt;ref name="OnFairyStories" /&gt;

An uninhabited world can be useful for certain purposes, especially in science fiction, but the majority of constructed worlds have one or more [[Sentience|sentient]] [[species]]. These species can have [[constructed culture]]s and [[constructed language]]s. Designers in [[hard science fiction]] may design [[flora]] and [[fauna]] towards the end of the worldbuilding process, thus creating lifeforms with environmental adaptations to scientifically novel situations.

===Physics===
Perhaps the most basic consideration of worldbuilding is to what degree a fictional world will be based on real-world [[physics]] compared to [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. While magic is a more common element of fantasy settings, science fiction worlds can contain magic or technological equivalents of it. For example, the Biotics in the science fiction video game series ''[[Mass Effect]]'' have abilities, described scientifically in-game, which mirror those of [[Magician (fantasy)|mages]] in fantasy games. In the science fiction novel ''[[Midnight at the Well of Souls]]'', magic exists, but is explained scientifically.

Some fictional worlds modify the real-world [[Physical law|laws of physics]]; [[faster-than-light]] travel is a common factor in much science fiction. Worldbuilding may combine physics and magic, such as in the ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series and the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise.

===Cosmology===
Constructed worlds often have cosmologies, both in the [[Physical cosmology|scientific]] and [[Religious cosmology|metaphysical]] senses of the word. Design of science fiction worlds, especially those with [[spacefaring]] societies, usually entails creation of a [[star system]] and [[planet]]s. If the designer wishes to apply real-life principles of astronomy, he or she may develop detailed [[Astronomy|astronomical]] measures for the [[orbit]] of the world, and to define the physical characteristics of the other bodies in the same system; this establishes [[Chronology|chronological]] parameters, such as the length of a day and the durations of [[season]]s.&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite book |first=Poul |last=Anderson |authorlink=Poul Anderson |year=1991 |chapter=The Creation of Imaginary Worlds |title=Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |isbn=0-312-06003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some systems are intentionally bizarre. For [[Larry Niven]]'s novels ''[[The Integral Trees]]'' and ''[[The Smoke Ring (novel)|The Smoke Ring]]'', Niven designed a "freefall" environment, a gas [[torus]] ring of habitable pressure, temperature, and composition, around a [[neutron star]].

Fantasy worlds can also involve unique cosmologies. In ''Dungeons and Dragons'', the physical world is referred to as the Prime Material Plane, but other planes of existence devoted to moral or elemental concepts are available for play, such as the [[Spelljammer]] setting, which provides an entirely novel fantasy astrophysical system. Some fantasy worlds feature religions. The ''[[The Elder Scrolls|Elder Scrolls]]'' series, for example, contains a variety of religions practiced by its world's various races. The world of the 2000 video game ''[[Summoner (video game)|Summoner]]'' has a well-developed cosmology, including a [[creation myth]].

===Geography{{anchor|Map making}}===
Map construction is often one of the earliest tasks of worldbuilding. Maps can lay out a world's basic [[terrain]] features and significant civilizations present. A clear, concise map that displays the locations of key points in the story can be a helpful tool for developers and audiences alike. Finished creative products, such as books, may contain published versions of development maps; many editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', for example, include maps of [[Middle-earth]]. [[Cartography]] of fictional worlds is sometimes called ''geofiction''.&lt;ref name=map_hacks2005&gt;{{citation |first1=Schuyler |last1=Erle |first2=Rich |last2=Gibson |first3=Jo |last3=Walsh |isbn=0-596-00703-5 |page=508 |title=Mapping hacks: tips &amp; tools for electronic cartography |series=Hacks Series |publisher=O'Reilly Media |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CiO5JtP171oC&amp;pg=PA508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[physical geography]] of a fictional world is important in designing [[weather]] patterns and [[biome]]s such as [[desert]]s, [[wetlands]], [[mountain]]s, and [[forest]]s. These physical features also affect the growth and interaction of the various societies, such as the establishment of [[trade route]]s and locations of important cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steven S. |last=Long |year=2002 |title=Fantasy HERO |pages=290&amp;ndash;294 |edition=[[Hero System]] Fifth |publisher=DOJ |location=[[San Francisco]] |isbn=1-58366-016-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desire for control of [[natural resource]]s in a fictional world may lead to [[war]] among its people. Geography can also define [[ecosystem]]s for each biome. Often, Earth-like ecology is assumed, but designers can vary drastically from this trend. For example, [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[short story]] "[[The Talking Stone]]" features a life form based on [[silicon]], rather than [[Carbon-based life|carbon.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hal |last=Clement |authorlink=Hal Clement |year=1991 |chapter=The Creation of Imaginary Beings |title=Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] | isbn=0-312-06003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[software]] programs can create random terrain using [[fractal]] algorithms. Sophisticated programs can apply geologic effects such as [[Tectonics|tectonic]] plate movement and [[erosion]]; the resulting world can be [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]] in great detail, providing a degree of realism to the result.

===Culture===
Constructed cultures, or concultures, are a typical element of worldbuilding. Worldbuilders sometimes employ past human civilizations as a model for fictional societies. The 1990 video game ''[[Worlds of Ultima: The Savage Empire]]'', for example, takes place in a world full of [[tribe]]s based on civilizations in early [[Mesoamerica]] and Africa. This method can make a fictional world more accessible for an audience. ''Simon Provencher'' has stated as a 'Golden Rule' of Worldbuilding that "... unless specified otherwise, everything inside your world is assumed to behave exactly as it would in the real world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Provencher|first=Simon|title=The Golden Rule of Worldbuilding|url=http://www.worldbuilderblog.com/the-golden-rule-of-worldbuilding/|work=Worldbuilder|publisher=Simon Provencher|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[Steven S. Long]], a representative of the [[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]] role-playing game, who stated that "Everything that happened in the real world has also unfolded in the exact same way in the Champions Universe." This means any past wars, elections, and technological advancements in our world occurred the same way in the Champions Universe unless explained otherwise.  Creating a cohesive [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] culture can be a distinct challenge. Some designers have also looked to human civilizations for inspiration in doing so, such as ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Romulan]]s, whose society resembles that of [[Ancient Rome]]. The fictional world's history can explain past and present relationships between different societies, which can introduce a story's action. A past war, for example, functions as a key plot point in the ''[[Shannara]]'' and ''[[Belgariad]]'' series.

==Types of constructed worlds==
Examples of constructed worlds include [[Terry Pratchett]]'s [[Discworld]], the pseudo-Earth [[Hyborian Age]] in the [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan series]], Arrakis in the ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' series, the continent of [[Tamriel]] in the [[Elder Scrolls]] series of games,  [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s [[Earthsea (universe)|Earthsea]] and [[Gethen]], the Subcontinent of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind]]'', and [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]], the location of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]], in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

Constructed worlds are not always limited to one type of story. [[Lawrence Watt-Evans]] and [[Steven Brust]] created [[Ethshar]] and [[Dragaera]], respectively, for role-playing games before using them as settings for novels. [[M. A. R. Barker]] originally designed [[Tékumel]] well before the advent of role-playing games, but many [[gamer]]s, including Barker himself, have used it as a setting for such games.

A [[shared universe]] is a fictional universe that can be used by different authors. Examples of shared universes include the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] and [[campaign setting]] developed specifically for role-playing games. One of the oldest of these is [[Oerth]], developed for the Dungeons and Dragons [[Greyhawk]] setting. [[Forgotten Realms]] is another such D&amp;D setting, originally a [[House rule#Gaming|homebrew]] campaign world by [[Ed Greenwood]].
